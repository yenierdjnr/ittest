00:00:16.649\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.540\nin today's episode we're coming\nback with more IC3 information.\n\n5\n00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.640\nAnd that's right, today we're gonna be\nlooking at working with applications.\n\n6\n00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.570\nAnd joining me in the studio today\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.930\nRonnie, how are you doing, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great as we\ncontinue on to take a look at\n\n9\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.810\nthe idea of working with key applications.\n\n10\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.590\nSomebody that is just beginning\nthe environment in terms of working with\n\n11\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.480\nthe computer,\n\n12\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.740\nwe need to understand of course\nthe idea of working with applications.\n\n13\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.770\nThe majority of times as you begin\nyour career in working with computers,\n\n14\n00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.900\nyou do not tend to work with\nthe operating system directly.\n\n15\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.120\nDon't get me wrong you'll use\nan operating system every day, but\n\n16\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.610\nyou don't tend to manipulate the operating\nsystem or change it on a daily basis.\n\n17\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.440\nIt really runs in the background and\n\n18\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.790\nallows us to do the interaction\nthat we want to.\n\n19\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.640\nBut on a daily basis, and\neven on an hourly basis at times,\n\n20\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.440\nyou will be working directly with\nindividual applications depending on\n\n21\n00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.400\nwhat you're actually doing, and that means\nyou need to spend a little bit of time and\n\n22\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.760\nunderstanding of course, the idea of\napplications and working with them.\n\n23\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.520\nNow, when we start talking about\nthe idea of working with applications.\n\n24\n00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.033\nWe're gonna show a few things, but\nreally, today is more of a discovery of\n\n25\n00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:32.329\ntalking about how in the world\ndo we get applications so\n\n26\n00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.940\nthat we can begin to work with them.\n\n27\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.247\nAnd, then we want to talk about some\nof the key applications, as well, and\n\n28\n00:01:38.247 --> 00:01:41.254\nthen talk about the installation,\nas well as the uninstallation.\n\n29\n00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:44.837\nAnd even a few different things that\nwe have to worry about when we do get\n\n30\n00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:49.370\napplications such as licensing agreements\nthat we have to worry about as well.\n\n31\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.874\nSo we're gonna be spending a bit of\ntime in going through several different\n\n32\n00:01:53.874 --> 00:01:57.663\ncategories and the idea of getting\nthe applications as well and\n\n33\n00:01:57.663 --> 00:02:00.537\nthat's what we want to\nstart off to take a look.\n\n34\n00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.164\nNow, at one point in time.\n\n35\n00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:07.490\nWhen we talk about the notion\nhere of getting applications.\n\n36\n00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.460\nThere used to only be one way.\n\n37\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.720\nAnd that was, you would go to your local\nretail store that sold software programs.\n\n38\n00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.110\nAnd you would pretty much pick\nthe software program that you needed.\n\n39\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.309\nIt would come in a cardboard box and the\nbox would look as impressive as could be.\n\n40\n00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.533\nIt would tell you all the details and\n\n41\n00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.091\non that box a lot of that of\ncourse was a nice fancy cover but\n\n42\n00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:33.987\nwhat you also need to look for of course\nwas specifications such as the idea here\n\n43\n00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:39.310\nof the minimum requirements needed to\nrun that application on your computer.\n\n44\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.640\nSo you do want to pay attention to things\nlike that when you go and take a look.\n\n45\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.610\nNow when you start to talk about that then\nthere's a couple of different things that\n\n46\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.100\nwe also need to know in today's world\nas well that will really help us out.\n\n47\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.410\nYou don't have to go to a particular\n\n48\n00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.410\nretail store anymore to\npurchase applications.\n\n49\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.190\nTo tell you the truth, you really\ndon't have to actually do much at all,\n\n50\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.430\nexcept for being able to get access to\nthe Internet anymore to get applications.\n\n51\n00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.780\nAnd today's application market is so\ndiverse because applications are not only\n\n52\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.290\ndealt with on the desktop computer and\nlaptop computers but\n\n53\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.010\nalso on mobile devices too where\nwe tend to work with them as well.\n\n54\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.070\nSo we need to understanding\nat least in those context,\n\n55\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.415\nhow do we normally get\napplications if we are to do so?\n\n56\n00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:31.555\nSo we're gonna take a look at all\nthese features, and show you,\n\n57\n00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:34.455\nof course then,\nhow to obtain different applications.\n\n58\n00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:36.615\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\nI've grabbed my mobile phone.\n\n59\n00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.905\nI've decided that I need\nsome kind of application.\n\n60\n00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:41.015\nI'm not sure exactly what application.\n\n61\n00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:43.945\nWhere am I gonna start looking when it\ncomes to acquiring those applications like\n\n62\n00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:44.905\nyou had mentioned?\n\n63\n00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:48.205\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to\nthe idea of working with a smartphone,\n\n64\n00:03:48.205 --> 00:03:52.190\nyou've really got to actually determine,\nwell, two things here, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.980\nFirst and foremost you need to determine\nwhat smartphone system are you using.\n\n66\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.350\nAnd by smartphone system,\n\n67\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.860\nnormally today it kinda breaks down into\none of three different smartphones, right?\n\n68\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.550\nWe tend to either have some type of\niPhone, okay, from Apple Computers.\n\n69\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.410\nOr tend to run some type of\nAndroid-based device, and\n\n70\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.800\nthose have many different\nhardware vendors out there.\n\n71\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.860\nBut they all support what we call Android.\n\n72\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.690\nAnd then, of course,\nthere is the Windows mobile phone as well.\n\n73\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.582\nThose are three different types of\noperating systems that also will allow you\n\n74\n00:04:24.582 --> 00:04:26.990\nto install applications on them, but\n\n75\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.410\nit also means that you have to know\nhow to get access to them to do so.\n\n76\n00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.810\nNow I've got an example of really\nthe idea of the Android, but\n\n77\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.690\nwe can talk about the other\nones here to help us out, too.\n\n78\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.870\nWhen it comes down to things like\nsmartphones, they do not run the standard\n\n79\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.580\napplications that you normally find\nrunning on regular desktop computers.\n\n80\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.600\nThese are designed to be more streamlined,\n\n81\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.736\nthey're designed to be\nmuch more efficient.\n\n82\n00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:55.811\nThey are not designed to be very\npowerful types of systems that or\n\n83\n00:04:55.811 --> 00:05:00.564\ntypes of applications that allow you to\nget a [INAUDIBLE] because most of them\n\n84\n00:05:00.564 --> 00:05:05.317\nare actually working on a screen that's\nlet's say five and a half inches,\n\n85\n00:05:05.317 --> 00:05:09.660\nsix inches maybe overall as a rectangle\nto be able to work on that.\n\n86\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.040\nDon't get me wrong, can you accomplish\na lot, definitely you can but\n\n87\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.480\noverall they're not actually designed\nto actually be one of these powerful\n\n88\n00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.820\napplications that eat up\na bunch of system resources.\n\n89\n00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.010\nThey're really designed to be\nvery efficient applications.\n\n90\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.640\nSo let's take for an example then,\nthat you have an Android device well,\n\n91\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.030\nwhat do you end up doing?\n\n92\n00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.810\nWell, let me show you on my screen.\n\n93\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.550\nI've got a piece of software here\nthat's going to allow me to connect.\n\n94\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.760\nAnd I've got my particular\nsmartphone connected to this, so\n\n95\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.450\nthat we can see it just\na little bit better.\n\n96\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.880\nSo on this particular Samsung machine.\n\n97\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.060\nYou can see right here.\n\n98\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.090\nThis is pretty much what my phone.\n\n99\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.840\nAnd actually, this is the dirt road\nthat I live on as the background.\n\n100\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.090\nBut here, when you start to take a look,\n\n101\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.700\nthere's a couple of things that\nwe want to take a look at.\n\n102\n00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.540\nBut when it comes down to\nobtaining the idea of applications\n\n103\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.950\nthere's really one central repository for\nus to be able to take a look at and\n\n104\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.970\nthat is what they call\nthe Google Play Store, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.224\nNow, usually on your Android\ndevice there'll be standard\n\n106\n00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:13.475\nicons that are actually loaded\non there when you go ahead and\n\n107\n00:06:13.475 --> 00:06:17.654\nyou enter in your user account that\nyou'll have to create at the beginning.\n\n108\n00:06:17.654 --> 00:06:21.311\nAnd, from that point, it will connect\nyou to these different places, and\n\n109\n00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:21.960\nthere it is.\n\n110\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.635\nI am now connected into\nthe Google Play Store.\n\n111\n00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:26.110\nAlmost said Gloogle.\n\n112\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.970\nGoogle Play Store.\n\n113\n00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.190\nAnd, it's here that you can see some\nof the different applications that\n\n114\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.720\nare actually available for\nyou to be able to download.\n\n115\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.480\nSome of these will actually\nhave cost associated with them.\n\n116\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.290\nSome of them are actually for free.\n\n117\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.320\nSo most of the ones that I see\nright here are actually for free.\n\n118\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.630\nBut I'm pretty sure if I scroll enough,\n\n119\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.710\nI can end up finding some that\nactually have of different cost.\n\n120\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.320\nOkay.\nSo\n\n121\n00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.150\nyou gotta actually take a look around and\nsee what you really need.\n\n122\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I've been to one\nof these screens before and\n\n123\n00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.310\none of the things it warned me,\nit said it may contain additional\n\n124\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.390\npurchases in order to get the full user\nexperience, what does that mean for us?\n\n125\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, the way that this actually\nends up working a lot of times,\n\n126\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.490\nwhen we start talking about getting some\ntype of application from the Play Store or\n\n127\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.820\nfrom any store is that they have\nwhat to call In-App purchases.\n\n128\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.175\nNow, that term In-App purchase\nmay mean that they'll give\n\n129\n00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:21.058\nyou some functionality of that\nparticular application for free, but\n\n130\n00:07:21.058 --> 00:07:23.453\nif you want to access more functionality.\n\n131\n00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:26.368\nThey tell you that you have to\nupgrade to the pro edition,\n\n132\n00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:29.227\nwhich means you've already\ngotten the application but\n\n133\n00:07:29.227 --> 00:07:33.720\nnow you need to pay a little bit more and\nget access to the pro edition instead.\n\n134\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.420\nThen all those other\nfeatures will be opened up.\n\n135\n00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:42.100\nNow most of these applications that we're\ntalking about they can actually run very\n\n136\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:49.280\ncheaply from maybe 99 cents, but some of\nthem can be incredibly expensive as well.\n\n137\n00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.494\nDon't overlook that as far\nas a purchase goes, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:55.021\nNow when you start talking\nabout purchasing them,\n\n139\n00:07:55.021 --> 00:07:56.970\nof course there's a couple of things.\n\n140\n00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.355\nLet me show you here the couple of things\nthat you have to worry about You might be\n\n141\n00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:03.350\nsaying, well, if they're all free,\ndo I need to do anything else?\n\n142\n00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.127\nWell, once you set up your account on your\nsmartphone, really one of the only other\n\n143\n00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:11.966\nthings that you might have to do is,\nlet me see if I can select that.\n\n144\n00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:16.227\nAnd that little hamburger button that you\nsaw in the upper right-hand corner, what\n\n145\n00:08:16.227 --> 00:08:20.260\nyou want to do is you want to scroll down\nhere to where you have some options here.\n\n146\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.840\nAnd let's see if I can zoom in.\n\n147\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.570\nOkay.\n\n148\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.190\nOne is your account and notice that\nyou have redeem and send a gift and\n\n149\n00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.540\ndifferent things here.\n\n150\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.225\nSo on this idea of the account\nif I can select that, well here,\n\n151\n00:08:32.225 --> 00:08:37.280\nlet me scroll out, and notice you might\nhave to add in a payment method, and\n\n152\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.460\nusually this involves a credit\ncard of some sort of.\n\n153\n00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.270\nNow I'm not going to click on mine so\nyou can see all the information.\n\n154\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.800\nBut, you get the idea here that\nyou do have to get that set up for\n\n155\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.350\nyou when you are actually\nconnecting to do this.\n\n156\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.120\nNow, the other system that's also out\nthere and let me see if I can scroll in.\n\n157\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.840\nThat way we get an example of both\nhere is inside of the Microsoft\n\n158\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.850\nworld that we call the Apple app store,\nthe app store itself, okay.\n\n159\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.490\nThe app store will pretty\nmuch show up like this.\n\n160\n00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.980\nAnd what you'll also end up seeing\nis that you will have, of course,\n\n161\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.780\nthe different apps.\n\n162\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.180\nSo like right here, you can see some of\nthese are actually gonna be expensive.\n\n163\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.978\nSo here's one for $13,\nand it's a pinball game.\n\n164\n00:09:16.978 --> 00:09:18.780\nThat doesn't sound super expensive, but\n\n165\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.190\nyou start adding them up after\nyou click on these things.\n\n166\n00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:26.140\nHere's excuse me,\nhere is one that says 24.99.\n\n167\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.971\nSo, you can see where it's actually\nstarting to get a little bit more.\n\n168\n00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:32.850\nHere's one that's $30, 34.99.\n\n169\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.300\nHere's one another one in here 45 bucks.\n\n170\n00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.880\nSo you can see where now all of a sudden\nthese things can get expensive.\n\n171\n00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.270\nYou still do the same thing.\n\n172\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.110\nYou go to the App Store,\nwhether you're on your iPhone.\n\n173\n00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.180\nHere I'm actually on just a Macbook Pro.\n\n174\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.290\nAnd you can of course download\nthese applications and pay for\n\n175\n00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.310\nthem and the same thing you stop to set up\nan account and still gonna charge you for.\n\n176\n00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.170\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, you know, you talked about\nthe old method that we used actually get\n\n177\n00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.780\ninto a car and\ndrive to a store by a box and\n\n178\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.260\nwe will install our one piece of software\non let's say, a desktop for instance.\n\n179\n00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.050\nNow Ronnie,\nyou're saying there's a benefit.\n\n180\n00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.360\nI can actually go multi platform in some\ncircumstances with these applications.\n\n181\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.030\nSo you can buy it once and\n\n182\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.680\nhave the potential to maybe use\nit on more than one device?\n\n183\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.780\n&gt;&gt; It depends on that licensing agreement,\nwhether or not it allows it to do that.\n\n184\n00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.910\nSo here for Apple, yes you definitely can.\n\n185\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:29.290\nIf you buy it for your iPhone,\nyou can also, of course, have it download,\n\n186\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.860\neven to your MacBook Pro as long as it\nworks and does what it needs to do.\n\n187\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.550\nIt will actually have that function for\nyou.\n\n188\n00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.180\nSo some of them will allow you to do that.\n\n189\n00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.910\nSome of them may say look, maybe not.\n\n190\n00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.790\nAnd then, of course,\nthere's also the Windows,\n\n191\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.360\nthey just call it the Windows Store right,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n192\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.640\nThe Windows Store presents\nsomething fairly similar but\n\n193\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.730\ninstead you'll see different tiles\ninstead of actually individual icons like\n\n194\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.890\nwhat we're seeing here.\n\n195\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.480\nAnd they will either have\na cost associated with them or\n\n196\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.155\nthey would be free for\nyou to be able to download.\n\n197\n00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:04.270\nAnd then once they're download they\nwill show up in your start menu and\n\n198\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:08.950\nyou should also be able to use that to do\neverything that you want to, but obtaining\n\n199\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:14.070\nthe apps, not difficult but you do need\nto know where you can obtain them from.\n\n200\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.530\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I'm not sure if anybody's out\nthere's familiar with my typing abilities,\n\n201\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.480\nbut you are talking about in the context\nof obtaining an application.\n\n202\n00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.500\nWhat happens if I accidentally\nmaybe type the wrong button, and\n\n203\n00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.880\nI delete this application?\n\n204\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.420\nLet's say, for instance,\nin your example here.\n\n205\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.809\nThe [INAUDIBLE], well,\nI almost said iTunes.\n\n206\n00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:32.361\nBut the app store here.\nDo I have the ability to reobtain that?\n\n207\n00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:35.690\nOr have I pretty much just lost it?\n\n208\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.640\n&gt;&gt; Usually,\nonce you've actually purchased that.\n\n209\n00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.930\nYou should be able to go back and\nget it on that device again and\n\n210\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.680\nit should be perfectly fine.\n\n211\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.620\nRemember that what you're doing is you're\nreally only downloading a copy of it, but\n\n212\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.310\nyou did purchase it for it's use, so\nthat way they always have a copy and\n\n213\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.780\nyou don't have to store a copy of\nit on your smaller devices here.\n\n214\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.080\nIt's always available to you as long as\nyou have Internet access, and that's kind\n\n215\n00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.850\nof the key when you start talking\nabout obtaining those applications.\n\n216\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.790\nNow, are those the only places\nthat you can get them from?\n\n217\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.120\nDefinitely not.\n\n218\n00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.440\nSo, there's also a lot of times where\nyou might find out something that,\n\n219\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.020\nit doesn't exist in one\nof those two places.\n\n220\n00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.110\nWell, that's when you have to\nmake a judgment of whether or\n\n221\n00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.560\nnot you should do this, or\nwhether you shouldn't do this, and\n\n222\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.720\nthat does come down to a judgement call.\n\n223\n00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.287\nMost of the time as far as beginners go,\nI recommend that you don't install\n\n224\n00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:28.724\nanything that doesn't come from at\nleast the official stores instead.\n\n225\n00:12:28.724 --> 00:12:32.945\nAs you get more advanced and you become\na little bit more trusting in these places\n\n226\n00:12:32.945 --> 00:12:36.726\nthat you can download apps from you\ndefinitely can, and then that way,\n\n227\n00:12:36.726 --> 00:12:39.814\nit will give you instructions\non how to actually do that and\n\n228\n00:12:39.814 --> 00:12:42.481\nget it installed onto your\ndevice sometimes too.\n\n229\n00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:45.087\nAnd so you do need to pay attention,\nbut overall though,\n\n230\n00:12:45.087 --> 00:12:46.783\nwe're not going that much in depth.\n\n231\n00:12:46.783 --> 00:12:50.410\nBut just realize that there are other ways\nthat you can get applications on there.\n\n232\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.540\nBut the best way of course is\nto go through those stores.\n\n233\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.080\nUsually once you click on it and you\naccept whatever the price is going to be,\n\n234\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.800\nyou normally end up downloading.\n\n235\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.390\nFor example, in the app store\nitself from Apple, it goes and\n\n236\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.950\ntells you it's downloading and\nthen it tells you it's installing.\n\n237\n00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.110\nThen when it's done, it tells you,\nhey, you've completed the download and\n\n238\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.550\nit's installed and all you have to do is\ngo and run it, and then you're off and\n\n239\n00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.680\nready to go.\n\n240\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.270\nInside of that Google Play Store,\n\n241\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.300\nit normally just tells you it's finished\ndownloading, and it's installing.\n\n242\n00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.294\nAnd, then it's ready for you to use.\n\n243\n00:13:19.294 --> 00:13:21.750\nSometimes, it's running in\nthe background already.\n\n244\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.550\nIt just depends on what you\nreally want to do with it.\n\n245\n00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.600\nBut that purchase of that is\nactually going to be key, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.510\nSo just remember that either\nit's going to be free or\n\n247\n00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.380\nyou're going to have to pay some money for\nit.\n\n248\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.960\nBut the way that you do that\nis by setting up and account.\n\n249\n00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.540\nSo just realize you'll probably\neither make a Google account or\n\n250\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.330\nyou'll probably end up\nmaking an Apple ID account.\n\n251\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.380\nAnd the key here is remembering\nthose account passwords.\n\n252\n00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.950\nDon't lose them,\nas easy as it sounds, they tell you,\n\n253\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.430\njust click here where it says forgot\nyour password and you're ready to go,\n\n254\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:57.850\nyou'll find out something as fast as you\ncan type that in and send you something,\n\n255\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.320\nyou're almost expecting this world for\nit, to be instantaneous.\n\n256\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.390\nYou got to enter all that stuff back in.\n\n257\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.690\nAnd then it tells you,\nokay looks like everything is done.\n\n258\n00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.830\nYou try and log back in and it may work\nautomatically and immediately sometimes.\n\n259\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.610\nSometimes if you're like me,\nit takes a good 30 minutes and\n\n260\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.630\nfinally after a little bit\nof time it's like, okay.\n\n261\n00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.140\nIt takes some time to\nget through the system.\n\n262\n00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.500\nBut what am I expecting?\n\n263\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.500\nIt to work immediately.\n\n264\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.400\nSo Just kind of realize you\nhave to deal with that.\n\n265\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.630\nObtaining the application is\nreally part of the battle, but\n\n266\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.210\nthe good thing is on smartphones,\nusually the installation and\n\n267\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.820\nit working is probably all done and\nyou don't have to worry.\n\n268\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.850\nNow, on the desktop environment though,\nIt can change up a little bit.\n\n269\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.670\nLet's go to a Windows 7 machine that\nwill really help us to understand this\n\n270\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.120\na little more.\n\n271\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.180\nNow from Windows 7 I went ahead and\nI've downloaded a couple of pieces of\n\n272\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.580\nfreeware that we can actually use to\nshow us a couple of different things.\n\n273\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.330\nSo over here on the left\nhand side on my screen,\n\n274\n00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.490\nI downloaded two different applications,\nokay?\n\n275\n00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.975\nNow, if I had actually purchase these, It\nwould come on some type of media, whether\n\n276\n00:15:04.975 --> 00:15:09.585\nit's on a USB flash drive or whether\nit's actually on something like a CD or\n\n277\n00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:14.845\na DVD disk and I would have to be able\nof course to run that and install it.\n\n278\n00:15:14.845 --> 00:15:19.645\nBut here I simply downloaded it off\nthe Internet and then I can go ahead and\n\n279\n00:15:19.645 --> 00:15:21.275\ndouble click on this and\n\n280\n00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:25.682\nhere's the first thing that we do need\nto pay attention to which is right here.\n\n281\n00:15:25.682 --> 00:15:28.480\nAll right, so\non my screen I went ahead and\n\n282\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.570\nI've downloaded a couple of\ndifferent apps from the Internet.\n\n283\n00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.710\nAnd I'm just gonna use, well,\n\n284\n00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.450\none of these to show the installation\nprocess on a desktop computer instead.\n\n285\n00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:42.103\nSo on this one down here,\nthis one is actually called TFTPD32.\n\n286\n00:15:42.103 --> 00:15:43.310\nYou're probably like,\nwhat the heck is that?\n\n287\n00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.970\nDon't worry about it.\n\n288\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.910\nIt's just an application\nthat we are going to run.\n\n289\n00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.783\nAnd in the Windows 7 environment,\n\n290\n00:15:48.783 --> 00:15:51.911\nhere's the first thing it's\ngoing to end up doing, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:55.449\nSo, you can tell that this particular\napplication was designed with\n\n292\n00:15:55.449 --> 00:15:57.460\nthis security feature in mind.\n\n293\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.623\nWhich gives us this user account control.\n\n294\n00:15:59.623 --> 00:16:03.620\nAnd when we take a look it's saying, look,\nare you sure you really want to do this?\n\n295\n00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.350\nDo you know that this is going\nto end up making some type\n\n296\n00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.090\nof change to the computer system?\n\n297\n00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.120\nAre you sure?\n\n298\n00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.410\nAnd you simply go ahead and select Yes.\n\n299\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.320\nAnd now this is what we want to\ntake a look at as well, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.360\nNotice that this one says\nEuropean Union Public Licence.\n\n301\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.120\nBut this is also something\nelse that you may also see.\n\n302\n00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.020\nHere in the United States we tend to\ncall this the idea of the end user\n\n303\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.850\nlicensing agreement.\n\n304\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:28.510\nOkay?\n\n305\n00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.870\nIn short EULA, the end user licensing\nagreement is another part of it.\n\n306\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.010\nNow what is that about?\n\n307\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.670\nThat is about the legal right\nthat that particular company or\n\n308\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.390\nperson that has produced this.\n\n309\n00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.350\nThey're saying what you can use this for,\nand what you shouldn't use this for.\n\n310\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.340\nNow it doesn't mean that if you\nstart using it for some of your own\n\n311\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.830\nnefarious purposes, that they're\ngoing to come out and just bite you.\n\n312\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.520\nNo, it doesn't mean that they're sending\nthe police after you immediately.\n\n313\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.310\nBut, it does mean that they can.\n\n314\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.325\nAnd, that's the key on some of these.\n\n315\n00:17:01.325 --> 00:17:05.133\nNow, when we get into this a little\nbit further and we've actually gotta,\n\n316\n00:17:05.133 --> 00:17:08.165\nthere's another exam that's\ncoming along with the IC3.\n\n317\n00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:12.907\nWe can talk about this idea of\nthe proprietary and the open source,\n\n318\n00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:17.151\nI was trying to remember what\nthose terms were, software.\n\n319\n00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:20.043\nAnd it actually says a little\nbit more about those details.\n\n320\n00:17:20.043 --> 00:17:23.647\nAnd normally this one right here,\nif you actually go through,\n\n321\n00:17:23.647 --> 00:17:26.095\nand you can see that\nwith the European one.\n\n322\n00:17:26.095 --> 00:17:32.770\nInstead of actually calling that an EULA\nhere they call it an EUPL instead.\n\n323\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.340\nBut it's the same functional\nidea that we're talking about.\n\n324\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.840\nAnd this is just letting you know\nthe legal requirements here, okay?\n\n325\n00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.772\nThat you have to understand\nas you go through this.\n\n326\n00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:49.093\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, is it fair to say with the U,\nPLL, let me see if I can say that again.\n\n327\n00:17:49.093 --> 00:17:50.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; EUPL.\n\n328\n00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:52.550\nI'm so used to calling it the EULA.\n\n329\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.790\nThat this is a legally binding contract\nand you can be either charged or\n\n330\n00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.450\nheld accountable with\nsome kind of litigation.\n\n331\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.532\n&gt;&gt; It is very possible.\n\n332\n00:18:00.532 --> 00:18:03.170\nAnd that's the key is to understand\nthat everything that's written here\n\n333\n00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.030\nas you were to scroll through that,\nit's all written by, well, lawyers.\n\n334\n00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.670\nAnd so, you have to understand\nthat what they're telling you is,\n\n335\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.120\nI do have the ability to\ndo this if I need to.\n\n336\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.420\nBut here's what you can do with it, and\nhere's what you shouldn't do with it.\n\n337\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.300\nAnd so, they are just telling you that if\nthey want to one day, they can come and\n\n338\n00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.520\nget you, as far as bringing charges\nagainst you, if they choose to.\n\n339\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.960\nSo you're either going to agree or\ncancel, if you select Cancel,\n\n340\n00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.860\nif we take a look at my screen again.\n\n341\n00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.200\nIf you select Cancel, it means,\nwell, it's not going to install.\n\n342\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.290\nYou select I Agree,\nthat means you agree to it.\n\n343\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:39.460\nAnd then from that point on you can go\nahead and take a look at the installation\n\n344\n00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.955\noptions and then select what you\nwant to actually select here.\n\n345\n00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:43.770\nOkay?\n\n346\n00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:48.110\nSo at this point I might go ahead and\nclick Next and then I select Install.\n\n347\n00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.280\nYou can select a different path for\nthe file to get installed,\n\n348\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.870\nbut I'm just going to leave it at\nits default and let it install.\n\n349\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.245\nAnd you might say,\nwhy did you choose that file?\n\n350\n00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:57.930\nCuz it installs almost\nimmediately here and\n\n351\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.920\nyou're not just watching a green\nbar go across the screen.\n\n352\n00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.880\nAnd once that's done, I can click Close.\n\n353\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.170\nAnd then, when I scroll back out.\n\n354\n00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.880\nAnd let me show you one of the things\nthat I did that changed the system that\n\n355\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.500\nWindows 7 really doesn't like.\n\n356\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.950\nIt created this little desktop icon for\nus, a shortcut is also what it created.\n\n357\n00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.180\nAnd also, modified something\nin that program file path.\n\n358\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.880\nAnd said, look, you're actually\ninstalling something that's changing.\n\n359\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.370\nAre you sure you want that as well?\n\n360\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.080\nSo that particular installation and\n\n361\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.410\nthe way that you can verify that it\nworks is you simply double-click on it.\n\n362\n00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.570\nAnd then it's telling me there's a couple\nof other things that it wants to do.\n\n363\n00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:36.900\nThis one wants to open up the firewall.\n\n364\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.940\nSo you might go,\nyes I want it to or no you don't.\n\n365\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.500\nWell, you gotta make\nthose decisions as well.\n\n366\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.270\nNow on a desktop computer that you're\nusing at work, it's not your choice, okay?\n\n367\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.290\nDo not install something on there\nthat is not going to be approved.\n\n368\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.690\nBut if you ever have\na question about this,\n\n369\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.720\nyou do need to ask your\nIT support personnel.\n\n370\n00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.060\nTo say hey, I've just installed\nthis program, is that okay or not?\n\n371\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.083\nAnd let them tell you.\n\n372\n00:20:03.083 --> 00:20:07.602\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you mentioned just a few\nminutes ago in this about knowing who\n\n373\n00:20:07.602 --> 00:20:09.520\nyou're downloading from.\n\n374\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.077\nIs this right here what we see?\n\n375\n00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:14.783\nA prime example, is it, to know and trust\nwho it is that you are communicating.\n\n376\n00:20:14.783 --> 00:20:17.540\nBecause it could open some kind\nof security vulnerability?\n\n377\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a part of it, right?\n\n378\n00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.020\nThe very fact is that, yes, you should\nonly download from trusted sources and\n\n379\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.220\nthat should be absolutely clear.\n\n380\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.700\nBut here is something that\nI'm just letting you know.\n\n381\n00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.420\nThis picker program is now saying,\nlook, I need to request access\n\n382\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.620\nthrough your firewall, and\nthat's when you have to be careful.\n\n383\n00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.970\nIf you know that it's gonna do that,\n\n384\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.900\nperfectly fine as long\nas you understand that.\n\n385\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.250\nBut it's not fine if you don't\nunderstand what that actually means.\n\n386\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:41.900\nDon't do it.\n\n387\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.720\nThat's what it really means\nwhen it comes down to it, okay?\n\n388\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.010\nSo just realize that there's a couple of\ndifferent things when you start talking\n\n389\n00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:53.850\nabout the installation of what has to go\non when you start to see that as well.\n\n390\n00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.920\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you started to\nscroll a little bit through to\n\n391\n00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.190\none of the application stores,\nif you will.\n\n392\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.240\nAnd I know there's a few of them, and\n\n393\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.160\nthe first thing I did is I got\nlost in the sea of the mix.\n\n394\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.700\nWhat application is what,\nwhat application does what?\n\n395\n00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.280\nCan you help us out on there, helping\nus kinda know some rhyme from reason.\n\n396\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.105\nAnd what all these different\napplications might fall into?\n\n397\n00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:15.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a bunch of different\ncategories of applications that you need\n\n398\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.130\nto be able to understand as you\nstart working with computers.\n\n399\n00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.370\nNow when it comes down to it,\nit breaks down into several kinda\n\n400\n00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.790\nbig categories here, and we're gonna go\nthrough some different examples of them.\n\n401\n00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:30.040\nBut the biggest category by far, since\nyou're starting your work in the realm of\n\n402\n00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:35.230\ncomputing is gonna be the idea of what we\ncall business productivity applications.\n\n403\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.070\nNow when you think about that, that sounds\nlike a big long technical term, but\n\n404\n00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.675\nit really isn't.\n\n405\n00:21:39.675 --> 00:21:41.650\nIf you think about the idea of business,\n\n406\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:47.390\nit's software that you're gonna use during\nbusiness and getting your job done.\n\n407\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.950\nAnd then the idea of productivity is\nto make it much more efficient, and\n\n408\n00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.060\nthen of course it's software based.\n\n409\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.620\nNow when you start thinking about some\nof these different types of business\n\n410\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.230\napplication products.\n\n411\n00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.860\nNormally what that means is, there's\nactually several different products that\n\n412\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.850\nallow us to actually be more efficient\nthan the way we used to do things.\n\n413\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.610\nSo for example, let's talk about the idea\nof working with a typewriter today.\n\n414\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.480\nEven though you and I might,\nbecause of working with a computer,\n\n415\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.090\nwe could see the translation\nback to a typewriter.\n\n416\n00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:21.010\nBut if somebody were to put a typewriter\nin front of us we would probably still\n\n417\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:25.200\nfeel a little bit lost in how to get\nstarted and how to do everything.\n\n418\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.790\nAnd so\nour productivity wouldn't go up, okay?\n\n419\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.560\nBut in today's world we use\nthings like word processors,\n\n420\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.290\nthat's a business productivity app,\nthat allow us to actually be, well,\n\n421\n00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.260\nmore productive with our typing.\n\n422\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.840\nNot only can we actually put words across\non paper anymore, but we can change it and\n\n423\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.060\nmodify it and do several different things\nthat we actually need to as well, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.480\nAlong with that of course,\nis the idea of desktop publishing.\n\n425\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.490\nIt used to be at one point in time, if you\never set up a newsletter of some sort,\n\n426\n00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.400\nand a manual style of everything\nthat you did, it took a lot for\n\n427\n00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.600\nthat setup to actually\nwork on a typewriter.\n\n428\n00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.480\nAnd I know, cuz I used to do it\nmanually when I was in college.\n\n429\n00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.280\nI used to actually set\none of these things up.\n\n430\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.220\nThese little newsletters that I had.\n\n431\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.040\nBut at the same time,\nit's not very productive.\n\n432\n00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.790\nWell you can take that\nsame word processor and\n\n433\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.320\nmake it make three columns if you want to.\n\n434\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.520\nMake it flow from one page over to another\npage without you having to turn paper over\n\n435\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.640\nand do a whole bunch of different things.\n\n436\n00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.840\nAs a news typist, typesetter would\nhave to actually have to end up doing.\n\n437\n00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.260\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings you can do there.\n\n438\n00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.250\nAnd working with numbers.\n\n439\n00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.710\nYou might think about\na spreadsheet program\n\n440\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.730\ninstead of using columnar\npads that are out there.\n\n441\n00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.700\nAnd then manually having\nto add up numbers.\n\n442\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.910\nMost of these spreadsheet programs are\nfairly powerful in crunching numbers for\n\n443\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.670\nyou that you can use to help you\nto become much more efficient.\n\n444\n00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:48.410\nOf course there's also presentation\nsoftware as well as database programs.\n\n445\n00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.786\nAnd we're gonna see a lot more of\nthat business productivity in this\n\n446\n00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:57.259\nparticular key application exam test and\nseries that we're doing.\n\n447\n00:23:57.259 --> 00:24:00.259\nAnd we'll be spending a lot more time on\neach one of those types of applications\n\n448\n00:24:00.259 --> 00:24:01.536\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n449\n00:24:01.536 --> 00:24:04.056\nSo just realize that that is probably,\nby far,\n\n450\n00:24:04.056 --> 00:24:08.477\nthe one that's going to benefit you the\nmost as you start working with computings.\n\n451\n00:24:08.477 --> 00:24:12.970\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I've seen in some businesses\nwhere they have a lot of employees.\n\n452\n00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:18.055\nI can't even remember sometimes a handful\nof numbers, my kids' birthdays.\n\n453\n00:24:18.055 --> 00:24:21.390\nNow when you have a big business,\nright, or it could be a small business.\n\n454\n00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.310\nAnd they have a lot of employees,\n\n455\n00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.680\nhow are we gonna keep track\nof all of that information?\n\n456\n00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.565\n&gt;&gt; Well there's a lot of different\nways that we can do that, and\n\n457\n00:24:29.565 --> 00:24:33.140\na lot of times it's specialized\nsoftware or accounting software.\n\n458\n00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.230\nAnd they even have very highly specialized\nsoftware that may work only for\n\n459\n00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.810\nthat only one particular type of business.\n\n460\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.540\nSo don't just think that generic\nbusiness productivity is all about just\n\n461\n00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.250\nthe things that we do everyday.\n\n462\n00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.570\nFor us, if we're just getting started,\nit will be.\n\n463\n00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.620\nBut as you become more and\nmore specialized and\n\n464\n00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.410\nworking with your field\nin whatever you're doing.\n\n465\n00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.190\nYou'll find specialty\napplications that are out there\n\n466\n00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.520\nthat are really purpose driven,\nyou'll end up seeing that.\n\n467\n00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.550\nYou work for a tax firm,\nyou're gonna find tax software out there.\n\n468\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.520\nYou work for an accounting firm,\nyou'll find special accounting software.\n\n469\n00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.514\nYou work for a team in which does a lot\nof sales, whether it's cold calling or\n\n470\n00:25:09.514 --> 00:25:14.589\nanything else, you'll work with different\ntypes of customer management or\n\n471\n00:25:14.589 --> 00:25:16.169\nresource management.\n\n472\n00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:17.884\nNo, what they call it,\ncustomer relations management,\n\n473\n00:25:17.884 --> 00:25:19.430\nI couldn't remember what the word was.\n\n474\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.160\nCustomer relation management types of\nsoftware that will be out there for\n\n475\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.310\nyou, and those are highly specialized.\n\n476\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.510\nThat's all done around\nthe notion of productivity,\n\n477\n00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.270\ngetting you to work much more efficiently.\n\n478\n00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:34.210\nGetting you to work better with\nthe systems that are actually out there.\n\n479\n00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.630\nAnd that's kinda the key category\n\n480\n00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.810\nthat we're gonna be spending\na little bit more time and focus on.\n\n481\n00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.680\nBut there's other ones that\nare out there as well, okay?\n\n482\n00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.550\nSo when we start talking about\nthe purpose driven types of apps,\n\n483\n00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.720\noperating systems have been very good\nat doing this one thing, too, okay?\n\n484\n00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.980\nThey provide for you some functionality by\ntaking a look at what they expect users\n\n485\n00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.670\nwill want to do when they run something\nlike Windows 7 on their machines.\n\n486\n00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.910\nAnd they provide for you some of it.\n\n487\n00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.150\nThey don't provide for\nyou the most detailed nature of things so\n\n488\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.760\nthat you actually produce the most\nfantastic thing you've ever seen.\n\n489\n00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.870\nBut they provide for you at least a basic\nunderstanding of what has happened.\n\n490\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.790\nFor example,\n\n491\n00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.560\nthe idea of the Calculator feature\nthat you can find inside of Windows.\n\n492\n00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.210\nIt's a basic calculator, but\nthen they also added in the ability for\n\n493\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.550\nyou to change it in to\na scientific calculator.\n\n494\n00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.310\nThey added a little bit\nmore features to it.\n\n495\n00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.710\nThere are some things that are out\nthere that are really designed for\n\n496\n00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.430\nhigh end very specialized things.\n\n497\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.056\nSo let's take for\nan example the idea of photo editing.\n\n498\n00:26:38.056 --> 00:26:42.326\nNow if you've seen somebody that's really\ngood at it, and we have a marketing person\n\n499\n00:26:42.326 --> 00:26:45.490\nhere really good at working with\nsomething like Illustrator.\n\n500\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:50.120\nAnd the other program that she runs,\nI don't remember what it is, but\n\n501\n00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.920\nit allows us to essentially\nmanipulate photos.\n\n502\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.400\nWell, yeah, you can spend a lot of\nmoney on that, but you don't have to.\n\n503\n00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.090\nLet me show you what I'm talking\nabout on my screen, okay?\n\n504\n00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:04.670\nSo here on my computer, I went ahead and\nI downloaded a picture.\n\n505\n00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:09.440\nAnd I tried to think of something that\nabsolutely would be something nobody's\n\n506\n00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.630\nreally gonna get upset at,\nat least I hope not, okay?\n\n507\n00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.320\nWhich is a cute puppy, okay?\n\n508\n00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:19.188\nSo if I right click on that link right\nthere where it says cutepuppy behind it,\n\n509\n00:27:19.188 --> 00:27:22.690\nnotice my third option here is Edit.\n\n510\n00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.682\nAnd if I select that, well look at that,\n\n511\n00:27:25.682 --> 00:27:31.755\nit actually brings up a picture of a cute\npuppy, okay, right there on the screen.\n\n512\n00:27:31.755 --> 00:27:34.466\nAt least I think it's cute, look at that,\nthat thing's adorable, okay?\n\n513\n00:27:34.466 --> 00:27:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's my dog by the way,\nI am thoroughly offended.\n\n514\n00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So there you go,\n\n515\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:44.300\nthis particular picture, though, well,\nit's all about editing the photo.\n\n516\n00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.749\nLook, I can actually drag it\nout just a little bit, and\n\n517\n00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:49.102\nin a moment here,\nit doesn't allow me to do it.\n\n518\n00:27:49.102 --> 00:27:51.080\nNevermind, so I can't actually drag that.\n\n519\n00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.782\nSometimes you actually get it where the\nimage won't allow you to drag it out and\n\n520\n00:27:53.782 --> 00:27:56.140\nexpand it it any larger than it is.\n\n521\n00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:00.390\nBut then you can also be able to edit\nthis in a couple of different ways.\n\n522\n00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:04.880\nI can rotate the image, let's see\nif I can rotate that if I want to.\n\n523\n00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.990\nNow notice that this is not anything\nthat's what we would consider\n\n524\n00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:16.100\nthe biggest idea here, okay, of saying\nthat this a full photo editing suite.\n\n525\n00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.260\nBut notice the basic features are here for\nus, and\n\n526\n00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.090\nwe can even go in now and,\nlet me see if I can do this.\n\n527\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:28.630\nJust make a simple,\nat least I believe simple, here, meme.\n\n528\n00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.770\nSo everybody loves memes, so why not?\n\n529\n00:28:35.242 --> 00:28:38.821\nOops, I thought I chose the right color,\nI'm hoping I did.\n\n530\n00:28:40.984 --> 00:28:45.385\nLet's try a color number 2 here, all\nright, so we'll try it this way anyways,\n\n531\n00:28:45.385 --> 00:28:46.480\nall right.\n\n532\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.723\nSo I can't believe it's,\n\n533\n00:28:54.904 --> 00:28:58.368\nIt's only Monday!\n\n534\n00:28:58.368 --> 00:29:01.043\nThere we go, and\nlet me change the font size here so\n\n535\n00:29:01.043 --> 00:29:02.840\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n536\n00:29:04.128 --> 00:29:05.410\nLet me select it then change it.\n\n537\n00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.040\nI was hoping that that would allow\nme to change the font color, but\n\n538\n00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.350\napparently I can't actually\nchange the font color.\n\n539\n00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.470\nThere we go, let's try that.\n\n540\n00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:24.500\nYeah, that worked incredibly well, so,\nbut you can see here that there it is,\n\n541\n00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.450\nwe've got at least this picture.\n\n542\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.386\nAnd so now you can see where you might\nfind applications like that, and\n\n543\n00:29:31.386 --> 00:29:33.397\nthere's plenty of them out there.\n\n544\n00:29:33.397 --> 00:29:38.300\nAnd a lot of them actually are based\non what they actually do as well, okay?\n\n545\n00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.521\nSo when you're working with an image like\nthis that's generally a picture that\n\n546\n00:29:42.521 --> 00:29:43.977\nyou have available to you.\n\n547\n00:29:43.977 --> 00:29:49.480\nWhen you start to do this, this is what we\ncall a some type of bitmapped image, okay?\n\n548\n00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.010\nAnd it's also what is called\nraster graphic as well.\n\n549\n00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.775\nNow that idea of the raster\ngraph means that there's only so\n\n550\n00:29:55.775 --> 00:29:57.640\nmany pixels that are on here.\n\n551\n00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.450\nAnd as you continue to stretch something\nout, the computer will try and\n\n552\n00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.410\nfill in those gaps and try and\nmake it look like a single image again.\n\n553\n00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.940\nBut it's really guessing what that\nimage is actually going to be, and so\n\n554\n00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.990\nit will get blurry.\n\n555\n00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.940\nAnd if you go ahead and squish it in, it\nwill actually squeeze out some of that and\n\n556\n00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.650\nstill maintain that picture\nas much as possible.\n\n557\n00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:20.140\nAnd then when you try and pull it back\nout into the original size, it tries and\n\n558\n00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.690\nit fills it back in again.\n\n559\n00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.590\nThe more often you do that,\nthe blurrier the picture is going to get.\n\n560\n00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:30.090\nAnd so you have that ability, but just\nkinda realize you do have to be careful\n\n561\n00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.180\nwith things like the raster\ntypes of images.\n\n562\n00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.234\nBut I also want to show\nyou something else, here,\n\n563\n00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.796\ntoo, let me just take this as an example.\n\n564\n00:30:40.885 --> 00:30:44.683\nOkay, now here, on this one, it's not so\nmuch, does it really matter, but I'm just\n\n565\n00:30:44.683 --> 00:30:48.140\ngonna put it on this picture right here so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n566\n00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.760\nOn this one, though, it doesn't do that,\n\n567\n00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.170\nregardless of what size it is,\nit's not gonna lose any image.\n\n568\n00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.390\nOr anything else that we have here,\nas far as pixels go.\n\n569\n00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:03.700\nAnd that's because this is what is\nconsidered a vector graphic instead.\n\n570\n00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.000\nA vector graphic says, look,\n\n571\n00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.140\nI'm not actually storing\nexactly where every pixel is.\n\n572\n00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:13.420\nIt's actually doing it based off of\na mathematical calculation on what you do.\n\n573\n00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.240\nSo this allows you to be able to draw,\nand expand, and collapse, and\n\n574\n00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.970\ndo everything that you want to.\n\n575\n00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.380\nBut you will generally be dealing with,\nessentially,\n\n576\n00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.520\nthose two types of elements when you start\nworking with something like a picture\n\n577\n00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.930\ntype of graphic creation in\nanything that you do as well.\n\n578\n00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.899\nThere's also things like web editing or\nweb authoring page,\n\n579\n00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:37.119\nweb authoring software\nwhich I can't say [LAUGH].\n\n580\n00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:39.951\nTypes of software out there that\nallow you to create a webpage,\n\n581\n00:31:39.951 --> 00:31:42.920\nallow you to manipulate, and\ndo things like this as well.\n\n582\n00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.210\nSo there are a couple of different\nones as far as categories out there.\n\n583\n00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.473\nAnd this one is more specific to,\nlike I said,\n\n584\n00:31:49.473 --> 00:31:51.345\nmore of the graphics type of element.\n\n585\n00:31:51.345 --> 00:31:54.433\nI don't think that this is the most\ncomplicated one that's out there, but\n\n586\n00:31:54.433 --> 00:31:56.880\nthis is at least one of them\nthat we can think about.\n\n587\n00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.720\nBut there's plenty more for\nus to take a look at.\n\n588\n00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.494\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, Ronnie,\n\n589\n00:31:59.494 --> 00:32:04.227\nit does look like we've got a lot\nmore good information coming up.\n\n590\n00:32:04.227 --> 00:32:06.850\nBut judging by that clock it does\nlook like we're gonna have to go into\n\n591\n00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.360\na part two.\n\n592\n00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.170\nBut before we do, Ronnie, do you have any\nadditional words you'd like to put into\n\n593\n00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.220\nthat or are we gonna save that for\npart two?.\n\n594\n00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.730\n&gt;&gt; Well we're just gonna take a look at\nmore of these, so do be ready for that.\n\n595\n00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.010\nBecause it is encumbent upon us,\nas we start working,\n\n596\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.610\nwe're gonna see some different things.\n\n597\n00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:25.362\nBut overall, though, just be ready as\nyou get into that work environment.\n\n598\n00:32:25.362 --> 00:32:28.675\nYou are going to be dealing with, well,\nsome of these different applications.\n\n599\n00:32:28.675 --> 00:32:30.755\nAnd understanding at least\nthe basics is gonna help you out.\n\n600\n00:32:30.755 --> 00:32:33.305\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, we appreciate\nyou joining us in the studios here.\n\n601\n00:32:33.305 --> 00:32:36.745\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\ntake the time and wrap up here at ITProTv.\n\n602\n00:32:36.745 --> 00:32:40.317\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n603\n00:32:40.317 --> 00:32:41.295\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n604\n00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:42.115\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n605\n00:32:43.220 -->

00:00:16.310\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.720\nin today's episode we're coming\nback at you with more I see three.\n\n5\n00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.820\nThat's right,\na part two on working with applications.\n\n6\n00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.950\nAnd joining me back in the studios\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.230\nRonnie, how you doing, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.010\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\n\n9\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.180\nand feels great to be back here as we\ncontinue on taking a look at these\n\n10\n00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.970\nkey applications when we need to actually\nbegin working with computer systems.\n\n11\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.610\nRemember that this is the type\nof thing that we are gonna\n\n12\n00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.380\nbe working with it on a day to day basis.\n\n13\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.500\nAs much as we need to understand\nabout the operating systems and\n\n14\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.910\ndifferent things, you and\n\n15\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.960\nI are gonna be focused in on working\nwith application on a day to day basis.\n\n16\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.110\nAnd we really taken a look at\na couple different types of\n\n17\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.430\napplications such as business\nproductivity applications, and\n\n18\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.090\nthen we also talked of course,\nabout the installation.\n\n19\n00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.500\nAnd we've also seen some\nof the different ones, and\n\n20\n00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.480\neven one focusing in on the idea\nof manipulating photos, as well.\n\n21\n00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.980\nSo let's go back to take\na look at my screen.\n\n22\n00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.060\nAnd we will pick up from here\nbecause we wanted to continue on.\n\n23\n00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.300\nNow, I've chained a couple things, if\nyou've been watching this in the series,\n\n24\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.290\ncuz I couldn't get the actual\nlettering to actually turn white,\n\n25\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.400\nI finally figured it out.\n\n26\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.600\nI didn't need select color two,\nI needed select color one, and\n\n27\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.050\nthat's pretty much the difference.\n\n28\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.090\nBut there it is.\n\n29\n00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.760\nI created a small meme out of\nthe picture of this puppy.\n\n30\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.540\nAnd I also added in this vector\ntype of graphic as well.\n\n31\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.860\nNow when we start to actually\nwork with these things, right.\n\n32\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.150\nA couple of different things\nwe'll actually end up working,\n\n33\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.210\nwhat, regardless of the level\nof the application.\n\n34\n00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.290\nThis is by far one of the most basics, but\n\n35\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.150\nthere's a couple of other things as we\nhover over images that we also add in.\n\n36\n00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.320\nSo notice that if I hover over this\nparticular oval that I have, right?\n\n37\n00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320\nAnd it turns into a compass\nlike four-pointed arrow,\n\n38\n00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.840\nwhich means I should be able to grab this,\nand be able to move this around, and\n\n39\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.250\nnotice it holds its shape as I do so.\n\n40\n00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.580\nBut then I also have sizing handles,\nthat if I hover over those shapes.\n\n41\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.200\nAnd I see that, those little tiny squares.\n\n42\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.360\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin a little bit more so\n\n43\n00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.810\nthat we can see a little bit better.\n\n44\n00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.780\nThere we go.\n\n45\n00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.350\nNotice that you actually see that,\nthere it is.\n\n46\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.230\nIt turns into a double headed arrow.\n\n47\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.890\nSame thing on the corners, and then on the\nside, you're starting to see that, too.\n\n48\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.500\nOkay?\n\n49\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.590\nNow, this allows me to\nreshape this particular\n\n50\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.270\nvector graphic that I\nhave available to me.\n\n51\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.920\nBut what if I wanted this larger,\nand I also needed to see this, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.730\nBut in the same perspective.\n\n53\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.920\nWell, a couple of things here.\n\n54\n00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.012\nYou can hold down control.\n\n55\n00:02:48.012 --> 00:02:49.460\nOr is it shift?\n\n56\n00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.380\nIs it shift, or control?\n\n57\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.650\nThere we go, looks like both will\nactually end up working, and\n\n58\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.810\nthat way you can keep it\nsame aspect ratio, and\n\n59\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.700\nit won't distort out of this original\nshape that you'll end up seeing.\n\n60\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.280\nNot anything really gigantic, and you're\nprobably not super impressed by that,\n\n61\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.990\nas you start working more and more with\nthe graphics much more impressive when you\n\n62\n00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.370\nstart seeing the multiple ways\nthat you can do things like this.\n\n63\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.180\nBut this was just a simple demonstration\non some of the very highly specialized\n\n64\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.800\ntypes of software that you can get when we\nstart talking about the idea of content\n\n65\n00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.640\ncreation.\n\n66\n00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.980\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned those\ngraphics programs, Ronnie,\n\n67\n00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.150\nthis being one that's built in,\nit's bundled in with the operating system.\n\n68\n00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.810\nAnd correct me if I'm\nwrong here on this one,\n\n69\n00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.870\nthese applications they\ncan get very expensive.\n\n70\n00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.180\nThey can be built in and be free,\n\n71\n00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.280\nessentially the cost of the operating\nsystem, or they can be very,\n\n72\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.890\nvery expensive depending on\nwhat your needs are, right?\n\n73\n00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.730\n&gt;&gt; They really can, and that's the key,\n\n74\n00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.690\nis understanding that whatever\norganization you work for.\n\n75\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.770\nIf they only leave you with Paint,\n\n76\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.860\nyou're probably not gonna be doing a lot\nwith photos and editing in that sense.\n\n77\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.900\nBut if all of a sudden you\nlook on your machine and\n\n78\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.180\nthey really have some advanced tools.\n\n79\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.400\nWhere instead of me showing you\nthat you can add in a text box,\n\n80\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.450\nthey show you not only\ncreating those text boxes,\n\n81\n00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.960\nbut a hundred times more\nas far as the detail goes.\n\n82\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.290\nThen you know that more than likely you're\ngonna be dealing with a lot more intricate\n\n83\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.620\ndetails in that particular perspective.\n\n84\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.620\nOn different things that you\nare ging to see as well.\n\n85\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.710\nSo you have again, those that help\nyou to focus specifically on some\n\n86\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.580\nwork detail or\ngeneral productivity that we talked about.\n\n87\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.720\nBut we could go even further and now even\ntalk about the idea of multi media or\n\n88\n00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.740\nthe idea of attainment that\nis on your systems too.\n\n89\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.430\nSo most operating systems also have\nsoftware that you'll deal with that will\n\n90\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.920\nallow you to be able to play music,\nplay videos, do whatever you want to.\n\n91\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.015\nIn that sense to actually\nshow you the information.\n\n92\n00:04:45.015 --> 00:04:48.865\nSo here, let me show you an example\nof what you might also run into\n\n93\n00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:50.385\nhere inside of Windows 7.\n\n94\n00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:54.442\nNow not every version, in other words\noutside of the United States you\n\n95\n00:04:54.442 --> 00:04:57.947\nmight find that this is not\npackaged in there sometimes, but\n\n96\n00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:02.023\nI have this particular thing that\nis called the Windows Media Player.\n\n97\n00:05:02.023 --> 00:05:06.530\nNow I went down here onto my task bar,\nand I selected this application that\n\n98\n00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.813\nhas a little play button on it,\nis what it has, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:13.245\nSo this media player, it's not\nsaying that it will only play music,\n\n100\n00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:15.033\nit's not what it's saying at all.\n\n101\n00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:19.780\nIt's saying media, so this particular\ntype of program here will allow me to\n\n102\n00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.601\nplay a video clip, it'll allow me to play\nmusic It will actually manage it for\n\n103\n00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:28.500\nme and allow me to actually\nwork with it as well, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.660\nSo you have something like this.\n\n105\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.720\nAnd so this is a very common one\ninside of the Windows world.\n\n106\n00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.520\nNow can you pay for\nstandalone ones that will do this?\n\n107\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.620\nHeck yeah, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.440\nYou're more than welcome to do that, but\n\n109\n00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.030\njust kinda realize that\nthis is what you have.\n\n110\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.070\nNow if we move into the Apple world,\nof course, this is where,\n\n111\n00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.830\nand you can go into, I think it's\ncalled iTunes, if I remember correctly.\n\n112\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.810\nI don't really use this too often.\n\n113\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.000\nBut you can actually see from right here\n\n114\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.420\nsome of the different ones that\nare actually out here for us.\n\n115\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.410\nAnd so here there's a few different ones,\nsome different songs and\n\n116\n00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.250\nsome genres and different things, but\nthis will also do the same thing.\n\n117\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.790\nIt's kinda that, I don't want anybody\nto get offended when I say equivalent,\n\n118\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.030\ncuz sometimes people get a little,\nbut It will do the same thing.\n\n119\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.240\nIt will play music or\nmay play a video clip for you.\n\n120\n00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.800\nAnd this one is actually connected for\nthings like this, right?\n\n121\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.150\nMy Mac Book Pro inside of the Windows\nworld I think you can actually\n\n122\n00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.460\ndownload iTunes for Windows as well if you\nchoose to and you can play it there too.\n\n123\n00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.120\nSo everybody has their favorite one but\n\n124\n00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.870\njust kinda realize that you're going to be\nworking in this situation you might find\n\n125\n00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.290\nout that learning about only one of\nthese is probably gonna help you out.\n\n126\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.470\nEspecially if you're actually told you\nneed to view this video series, or\n\n127\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.990\nyou have to listen to this audio series,\nand here's the thing for you to do so.\n\n128\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.700\nThese are particular applications that\nare really designed to help you to get\n\n129\n00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.090\nthe most out of that media file that you\nhave available to you as well, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.710\nSo those are kinda interesting\ntypes of applications, more towards\n\n131\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.620\nthe entertainment side but you do have\nto realize that they are there and\n\n132\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.160\nthey are available to you as well, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.190\nNow, a more focused type of,\nI don't wanna call it entertainment but\n\n134\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.930\nwe wanna call it education instead,\nis that there's\n\n135\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.430\napplications out there designed to\nhelp you to become more educated.\n\n136\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.200\nYou might wonder,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n137\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.050\nWell, if you've ever wanted to learn\na language you can go out there and\n\n138\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.510\npurchase some language software so\ninstead of you having to attend a class,\n\n139\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.060\nthere is language software\nthat's out there and available.\n\n140\n00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.780\nYou download it.\nYou put it onto your computer and\n\n141\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.190\nfollow the instructions.\n\n142\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.180\nAnd probably within a few weeks you'll\nbe speaking that particular different\n\n143\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.700\nlanguage that you wanted to as well.\n\n144\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.051\nNow one of the applications that\nmost people made fun of me,\n\n145\n00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:52.870\nI've been a technical instructor for\nten or 11 or 12 years now,\n\n146\n00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.435\nwhen you start to take a look Is\nthe idea of learning how to type.\n\n147\n00:07:56.435 --> 00:08:00.624\nI know that this sounds strange but it's\none of the best skills that you should\n\n148\n00:08:00.624 --> 00:08:03.910\nabsolutely have if you\ndon't already have it.\n\n149\n00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.229\nMost of the time you can go and find\nthat in your favorite retail superstore,\n\n150\n00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:13.089\neven by the register, when you're buying\nsoftware applications that say typing for\n\n151\n00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:16.135\nbeginners and it might cost you ten bucks.\n\n152\n00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:19.000\nIt's worth it if it really\nteaches you how to type.\n\n153\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.410\nYou're not going to get anymore\nproductive out of productivity software\n\n154\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.495\nif you really can't manipulate\nthe keyboard quicker than hunting and\n\n155\n00:08:26.495 --> 00:08:30.330\npecking which is one key at a time\nusing one finger because you're\n\n156\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.760\nactually trying to look for\nthe key you're trying to hit.\n\n157\n00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.470\nSo I do recommend that if you\ndon't have that particular skill.\n\n158\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.050\nBut if you do, you are well on your way to\nbeing able to learn just about everything\n\n159\n00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:44.530\nthat you need to learn in terms of\nworking with computers as well.\n\n160\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.600\nNow there is of course math programs for\npeople that are out there that need to\n\n161\n00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.430\nlearn how to do algebra or\nwhatever situation that they may be in.\n\n162\n00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.530\nBut just kinda realize there are plenty\nof educational software out there.\n\n163\n00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.640\nNow everything that we've talked\nabout up to this point no less,\n\n164\n00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.220\nhas really been designed around\nthe idea of using it, but\n\n165\n00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.650\nhaving it installed on the smartphone or\non the computer system itself.\n\n166\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.970\nBut there's software out there\nthat you can actually use and\n\n167\n00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.470\npurchase that's actually\nnone of those things.\n\n168\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.700\nYou don't actually install\nthem on a smartphone.\n\n169\n00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.820\nYou don't actually install it on the\ncomputer, but you still have access to it.\n\n170\n00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.310\nAnd one of those systems is what we\ncall some type of software as a service\n\n171\n00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.490\ninstead.\n\n172\n00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.040\nAnd this allows me to be able to gain\naccess to it, but for a subscription.\n\n173\n00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.800\nI can use my web browser.\n\n174\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.140\nAnd then I log into that website, and\nI now have access to that software.\n\n175\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.870\nIt used to be the idea here, when we\nactually had encyclopedias on disk,\n\n176\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.150\nI know it sounds strange, but\nit used to be like that, where you did,\n\n177\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.930\nyou had to buy this disk, and\nthen you had it on there.\n\n178\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.310\nBefore that, it was, of course,\nsets of books that you had available.\n\n179\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.130\nBut the very fact is,\n\n180\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.150\ntoday, you can just purchase that\nsubscription to be able to do that.\n\n181\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.470\nAnd that way you have access to\nthe entire encyclopedia brand,\n\n182\n00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.800\nwhatever you want to access.\n\n183\n00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.050\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, so what other kind of\neducational software can we see?\n\n184\n00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.370\n&gt;&gt; Well a lot of times what we've\nbeen talking about so far, right?\n\n185\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.295\nIs really that ability to have\nsomething installed onto the computer.\n\n186\n00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:17.985\nAnd this is true whether it's\na smartphone or whether it's a computer.\n\n187\n00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:19.985\nWe download it and we install it.\n\n188\n00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:20.635\nOkay.\n\n189\n00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:22.715\nBut there's software that's\nactually available out there for\n\n190\n00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:25.115\nyou that you really don't\ninstall onto your computer.\n\n191\n00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:27.495\nBut you still have the ability to use it.\n\n192\n00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:30.515\nAnd that is some of the educational\nsoftware that you see out there\n\n193\n00:10:30.515 --> 00:10:31.855\ntoday as well.\n\n194\n00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:32.435\nOkay.\n\n195\n00:10:32.435 --> 00:10:37.060\nAt one point we used to be\nable to have encyclopedias\n\n196\n00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.270\nthat we used to buy in books\nmore than anything else.\n\n197\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.220\nAnd then it became a single disc.\n\n198\n00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.610\nBut they still ended up getting\ninstalled onto the computer,\n\n199\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:50.790\nat least the program of it, the actual\ndatabase of it was still on the disc.\n\n200\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.830\nBut overall though, you had to do that.\n\n201\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.760\nWell today they've even taken\nthat notion away to do that.\n\n202\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.070\nAnd now all you have to have\nis an Internet connect and\n\n203\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:03.540\na browser the majority of the times,\nthat now you simply log in, and\n\n204\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.810\nyou use their website like it's\nyour own personal encyclopedia.\n\n205\n00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.730\nNow you may be wondering, I know this,\nI've heard of Wikipedia before.\n\n206\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.320\nOkay?\n\n207\n00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.840\nAnd don't get me wrong, Wikipedia\ncan be a source of information, but\n\n208\n00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.620\nit shouldn't be your primary\nsource of information.\n\n209\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.190\nEver, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.610\nNow don't get me wrong.\n\n211\n00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.380\nPeople do a lot of great work on there,\n\n212\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.630\nbut they can also manipulate and\nchange it.\n\n213\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.860\nAnybody can.\n\n214\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.390\nAnd that means from minute to minute,\nyou do not know whether or\n\n215\n00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.550\nnot you're actually getting\nthe truth about something, or\n\n216\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.240\nwhether you're not getting\nthe truth about something.\n\n217\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.910\nAnd this was such a problem,\nat least here in the United States.\n\n218\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:47.770\nIt's funny that they even had legislators\nwhere Wikipedia said, look, we're\n\n219\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.530\nnot allowing legislators and their staff\nto actually edit their own pages anymore.\n\n220\n00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.270\nIt was too much.\n\n221\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:58.260\nThey were literally changing\ntheir own pages so often that\n\n222\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.540\nnobody knew what the actual material\nreally was and what the truth was.\n\n223\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.280\nSo that's why I don't recommend Wikipedia.\n\n224\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.920\nCan you find out some\nquick information on stuff\n\n225\n00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.150\nthat probably doesn't change very often?\n\n226\n00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.830\nYes.\n\n227\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.600\nWill you ever find out any truth on\nsomething that's really changing\n\n228\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.360\nvery much?\n\n229\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.410\nNo, okay.\n\n230\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.050\nSo always pick something else.\n\n231\n00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.720\nAnd usually if you pay for that service,\nyou will get access to it for six months,\n\n232\n00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.740\na year, three months,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n233\n00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.470\nYou can pay for that price and\n\n234\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.350\nnow you have access to an entire\ndatabase that they have.\n\n235\n00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.480\nAnd this is where you also see that in\napp purchase again, where they say,\n\n236\n00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.020\ntry our site for free for\nthree days or a week, and\n\n237\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.360\nthen once you get hooked to using\ntheir site, then they go all right,\n\n238\n00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.250\nhere's how you continue on for\nthe remainder of the year.\n\n239\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.350\nAnd there it is,\nyou now have access to it.\n\n240\n00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.070\nA lot of times it comes as\nan icon on your desktop now,\n\n241\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.010\nand it just connects in whenever\nyou're actually ready to go.\n\n242\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.070\nAnd so now you're up and ready,\ndon't even need your own browser anymore.\n\n243\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.730\nIt just comes as a small little app and\n\n244\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.800\nthen you simply do your\nsearching through there.\n\n245\n00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.910\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, with computers today\neverything is so fast moving.\n\n246\n00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.560\nWe gotta go, we gotta go.\n\n247\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.300\nEating breakfast and lunch on the run.\n\n248\n00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.440\nWe've gotta make sure that we\nhave information available.\n\n249\n00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.910\nSometimes we gotta collaborate.\n\n250\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.250\nSometimes we gotta stay connected.\n\n251\n00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.790\nIs there a type of application that,\nwith the hustle and bustle of today,\n\n252\n00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.000\nthat can help us be aware of\nwhat's going on with other people?\n\n253\n00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.720\nAnd even maybe some of our own coworkers\ninside of the business environment?\n\n254\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.560\n&gt;&gt; Well there definitely is a ton of\nsoftware that deals with the idea of\n\n255\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.030\ncommunication and collaboration.\n\n256\n00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.630\nThat we are going to become familiar\nwith as we work inside a computer\n\n257\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.400\nbased workplace, right?\n\n258\n00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.260\nBecause the idea of\ncommunication is the life blood\n\n259\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.710\nof that type of system\nthat's moving around.\n\n260\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.770\nSo one of those systems and the software\nthat you're generally gonna encounter,\n\n261\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.490\nof course, is some type of email software.\n\n262\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.040\nEmail is pretty much that\ncommunication bloodline\n\n263\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.290\nthat every company ends up using.\n\n264\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.000\nOne, it's easy to actually end up using.\n\n265\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.070\nIt's fairly intuitive.\n\n266\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.530\nI remember the first time\nI actually sent an email.\n\n267\n00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.040\nIt didn't take me any instruction book.\n\n268\n00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.140\nI simply clicked on\na word that said email.\n\n269\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.250\nIt brought it up, and it had a to line and\nit had a subject line and\n\n270\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.520\nit had a blinking cursor.\n\n271\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.550\nI knew exactly what to do at that point.\n\n272\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.940\nAnd then it had a big\nbutton that said send.\n\n273\n00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.190\nSo that's easy enough at times,\nwhen you start taking a look.\n\n274\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.270\nAnd so most people can intuitively\nadapt to that type of system.\n\n275\n00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:23.630\nNow in email type of communication, that's\nwhat we call asynchronous communication.\n\n276\n00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.440\nIn this sense,\nin that you have to wait for\n\n277\n00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.960\nthe reply to come back before you answer.\n\n278\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.920\nNow of course, in today's world, right?\n\n279\n00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.230\nIn the 21st century,\n\n280\n00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:37.060\nwe want a little bit faster than that\ntype of communication a lot of times.\n\n281\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.240\nAnd even though email is fairly\nfast cuz as soon as I send it,\n\n282\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.060\nit's instantaneously over on Wes's\ncomputer, at least it seems like it.\n\n283\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.990\nBut it could be that Wes is in\nthe middle of hosting the show.\n\n284\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.850\nAnd he can't answer my email right\naway and I want his answer, okay?\n\n285\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.290\nAnd so that means he has to wait until he\ngets off the show hosting with Ronnie and\n\n286\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.740\nthen he can answer it and by that\npoint it can be a half an hour later.\n\n287\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.540\nIt can be a little bit of\ntime before he answers.\n\n288\n00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.030\nSo there's actually other types of systems\nthat allow for this type of communication.\n\n289\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.295\nAnd this is where you get into\nthe idea of text messaging or\n\n290\n00:15:11.295 --> 00:15:13.775\ninstant messaging as well.\n\n291\n00:15:13.775 --> 00:15:16.595\nAll these systems are actually\nin play out there for\n\n292\n00:15:16.595 --> 00:15:18.645\npeople to be able to communicate, and\n\n293\n00:15:18.645 --> 00:15:23.195\nthis is as close as we are gonna get\nto true synchronous communication.\n\n294\n00:15:23.195 --> 00:15:27.000\nIt's still where I'm sending and\nthen Wes has to respond.\n\n295\n00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.850\nBut a lot of times it's because it's so\nshort, and the message is so fast,\n\n296\n00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.750\nit pops up on the screen, he can answer\nin very quick terms, and even before I\n\n297\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.200\ntoss it over to Wes for a question,\nor for him to change the topic for\n\n298\n00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.205\nme, that he could have answered a question\nfrom a text message just that easily.\n\n299\n00:15:43.205 --> 00:15:45.597\nHopefully he's not doing that,\nbut overall though,\n\n300\n00:15:45.597 --> 00:15:47.524\nthat's what can actually happen, right?\n\n301\n00:15:47.524 --> 00:15:52.167\nSo it does seem almost synchronous in\nthat way where he's live chatting with\n\n302\n00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:57.520\nsomeone right then and there and that's\nactually working out for you as well.\n\n303\n00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.834\n&gt;&gt; So the content itself\nmight be time sensitive.\n\n304\n00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:02.990\nBut inherently the platform\nitself isn't time sensitive.\n\n305\n00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just one of those things\nwhere it's as close as we're going to get.\n\n306\n00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.780\nNow, just when I say that,\nis there even more.\n\n307\n00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.620\nOf course.\n\n308\n00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.510\nIn today's world and\n\n309\n00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.180\nthe visual nature of what you're seeing,\nthere are of course the ability\n\n310\n00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.230\nto do things like what we call Skype\nwhich allows you to do video messaging.\n\n311\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.330\nAnd that, again, is as close to\nreal time as we are gonna get.\n\n312\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.550\nThere maybe a little bit of delay but\nthe neat thing is the end user doesn't\n\n313\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.170\nrealize that delay\nthe majority of the time.\n\n314\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.320\nAnd that's because what they're delayed\non their end or delayed in our end and\n\n315\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.570\nthat's what's gonna happen.\n\n316\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.970\nBut if you heard of Skype, Skype for\nbusiness, any type of video chatting\n\n317\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.130\nthat's out there or Facetime, those\nare very popular ones that are out there.\n\n318\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.670\nIt is pretty much as close as we\nare gonna get to being face to face,\n\n319\n00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.630\na lot of times, when the person's\nhalfway around the world.\n\n320\n00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.050\nYou do have to deal with latency.\n\n321\n00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.000\nThat is how long it does take for that\nmessage to get over there, and then for\n\n322\n00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.710\nit to return.\n\n323\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.330\nBut, overall though,\n\n324\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.790\nthose are some of the things that we can\nalso have that's available out there, too.\n\n325\n00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.270\nAnd, of course, in business, you even deal\nwith what we call collaboration software\n\n326\n00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.930\nwhere it allows us to communicate\nbased on documents that we have or\n\n327\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.960\non information that we see.\n\n328\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.570\nSo instead of me opening up a single\nfile and then making all my changes, and\n\n329\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.240\nthen Wes opening up that file,\nmaking changes, and\n\n330\n00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.900\nsaying I disagree with\nRonnie's change over here.\n\n331\n00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.890\nSends it back to me, and I say this is\nwhy you can't disagree with me, and\n\n332\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.230\nthen he goes, yes, I can.\n\n333\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.100\nAnd it continues back and forth.\n\n334\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:32.090\nThere is a way that we can collaborate\non the same document at the same time.\n\n335\n00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.650\nAnd we open up the same information, and\n\n336\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.550\nthat way he can make changes at the same\ntime I am making those changes.\n\n337\n00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.340\nAnd then, we can agree to collaborate\nbased on that aspect too.\n\n338\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.050\nSo there's a lot of information\nout there and available for\n\n339\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:49.760\nus in that type of software that we call,\nagain, communication and collaboration.\n\n340\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.160\nThat's because it's the nature\nof the world today.\n\n341\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.740\nWaiting hours for\nsomeone to change and to do all that.\n\n342\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.850\nWe're just not in that habit anymore.\n\n343\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.400\nIt is becoming a quicker and quicker world\n\n344\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.340\nin that sense that we have a lot more\nsoftware that makes it easy to refer for\n\n345\n00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:09.910\nus to have that real time experience or\nnear real time experience that we have.\n\n346\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.310\n&gt;&gt; You know Ronnie,\nI've got my office application,\n\n347\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.470\nlet's say I've got my word\nprocessor ready to go.\n\n348\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.140\nI've decided that I'm\ngonna use Paint because,\n\n349\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.300\nwell that's Wes's graphical nature.\n\n350\n00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.780\nThat's about all I can use for\nany kind of video or image editing.\n\n351\n00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.040\nAnd then, I decide okay, maybe I need\none of these communication apps and\n\n352\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.210\nnow I've got Skype.\n\n353\n00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.120\nI know what applications I want.\n\n354\n00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.170\nNow, it's up to doing the installation or\nthe app.\n\n355\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.940\nWhat are some additional things\nthat I might need to keep in mind\n\n356\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.530\nwhen it comes to getting that\napplication I want on one of my devices?\n\n357\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, the idea here is,\nfirst of all, right?\n\n358\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.740\nThe key, especially if you\nhappen to get it on your device,\n\n359\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.890\nis to make sure that your\ndevice will support it.\n\n360\n00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.400\nSo you need to know what\nthe minimum requirements were.\n\n361\n00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.850\nSo let me give you a very\nreal world example\n\n362\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.170\nof something that doesn't work anymore.\n\n363\n00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:59.170\nThe app store has continued to develop\napps, at least for a long time now.\n\n364\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.950\nAnd I have a first generation iPad.\n\n365\n00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.600\nDoes Ronnie still use it everyday?\n\n366\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.610\nYes, I still use it every single day.\n\n367\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.980\nI read off it, it is one of my\nprimary tools that I read off of.\n\n368\n00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.560\nAnd take a lot of notes on it too.\n\n369\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.220\nBut the funny thing is,\nnow that the, what, six or\n\n370\n00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.280\nseven years old now,\nI can't download a single app,\n\n371\n00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.180\nfrom the app store on this modern and\nhave it actually installed.\n\n372\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.470\nIt says, I can install it,\nI go and click on it and\n\n373\n00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.620\nit starts to run through and\nthen after a while it just says Yeah,\n\n374\n00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.280\nyour device is no longer supported for\nthis application.\n\n375\n00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.240\nNow, just when you think, man,\n\n376\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.230\nthere must be something complicated, I'm\ntalking about just a basic web browser.\n\n377\n00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.060\nGoogle Chrome,\nI'm talking about Google Chrome.\n\n378\n00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.180\nIt just won't install anymore, and\nthat's because the hardware will no\n\n379\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.000\nlonger support that application and\nits nature on what it needs.\n\n380\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.090\nSo you always need to verify and\ncheck whether or\n\n381\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.940\nnot your device will support it.\n\n382\n00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.390\nThe great thing is, in the app store or\nwhether in the Google Play Store,\n\n383\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:04.420\nit tells you whether or\nnot your version of the iOS from Apple or\n\n384\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:10.102\nthe Android operating system\nfrom Google will actually work.\n\n385\n00:20:10.102 --> 00:20:13.180\n&gt;&gt; So that seems they are keeping\nus in check here, its not so\n\n386\n00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.370\nmuch about compatibility.\n\n387\n00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.760\nWell, it is about compatibility obviously,\nbut\n\n388\n00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.820\nif it isn't compatible with your device\nyou don't have to worry about a ruined\n\n389\n00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.520\nuser experience because they're not gonna\nlet it download on to that device anyway.\n\n390\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.936\nIs that what we're expecting?\n\n391\n00:20:24.936 --> 00:20:27.210\n&gt;&gt; You're starting to see some of that.\n\n392\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.410\nBut that's not the only key because of the\nway that software can be obtained today\n\n393\n00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.640\nthere is a big a growing concerning,\nconcerned need, or\n\n394\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.630\nconcerning a situation I'm trying to\nremember what the actual proper word.\n\n395\n00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.210\nConcern that's out there\nthat's what I should say.\n\n396\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:47.480\nAbout the nature of software piracy which\nI wasn't going to be able to say again.\n\n397\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.530\nAnd so, there's a lot of companies\nthat also have what they call\n\n398\n00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.550\nanti piracy techniques to help out.\n\n399\n00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.990\nSo one of those is that when you download\nsomething that company may provide for\n\n400\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:01.130\nyou a product license key of some sort or\na product key.\n\n401\n00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.360\nAnd that is a specialized key that\nyou have to enter in during the time\n\n402\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.170\nof installation a lot of times,\nthat says, yes, this is valid copy.\n\n403\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.310\nNow, just when you think\nthat that's enough,\n\n404\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:15.230\nit's really not, because people can\nobtain these product licenses and\n\n405\n00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.910\nthere, you go, you're ready to\ngo as far as that product key.\n\n406\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.495\nAnd if they do that, that's perfectly\nfine, but now these companies are saying,\n\n407\n00:21:22.495 --> 00:21:23.084\nlook, for\n\n408\n00:21:23.084 --> 00:21:27.627\nyou to actually have that product key not\nonly on there, but we also need to check.\n\n409\n00:21:27.627 --> 00:21:30.997\nAnd that means you need to have\nan Internet connection because it goes and\n\n410\n00:21:30.997 --> 00:21:34.201\nchecks with some place out there\non the Internet that says, Ronnie,\n\n411\n00:21:34.201 --> 00:21:36.744\nyou've installed this\naccording to the product key,\n\n412\n00:21:36.744 --> 00:21:39.710\nI see this product key's\nbeen used 600 times.\n\n413\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.174\nWell, now all of a sudden,\nthat company goes, yeah,\n\n414\n00:21:42.174 --> 00:21:44.385\nwe're not gonna allow\nany more installations.\n\n415\n00:21:44.385 --> 00:21:46.190\nNow, 600 would be overly generous.\n\n416\n00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.140\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n417\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.790\nUsually, three or four times,\nmaybe five sometimes, is probably okay.\n\n418\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.020\nBut not all the time.\n\n419\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.100\nYou need to read that end user licensing\nagreement to understand and to make sure.\n\n420\n00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.900\nBut they also have that ability to do\nwhat they call product activation.\n\n421\n00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.730\nAnd so, product activation is\nabout the anti-piracy technique.\n\n422\n00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.380\nYou can use that product key all you want.\n\n423\n00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.880\nSo Wes can download a product key and\ngo, I've got a product key now.\n\n424\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.100\nBut when he doesn't activate it,\nit can now lead him to a very,\n\n425\n00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.050\nnot completely disabled, but\nto a disabled version of that product.\n\n426\n00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:25.080\nSo for example,\nlike in Microsoft Word, he can use it.\n\n427\n00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.520\nIf he doesn't activate it, after a while,\n\n428\n00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.130\nit's gonna say,\nof course you can continue to use it.\n\n429\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:34.320\nBut, then, when he goes, look, I've just\nfinished typing out my 300 page book.\n\n430\n00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.630\nNow, I'm ready to print it out.\n\n431\n00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:36.600\nIt's gonna tell him,\n\n432\n00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.670\nsorry, you need to activate this\nbefore you can actually print.\n\n433\n00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:45.200\nThis particular, well,\nnow all of a sudden you're like.\n\n434\n00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.850\nAnd now it's gonna say look, you're not\nactivating it, you're still using it, but\n\n435\n00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.940\nafter a while you might find that\nactually it works even less.\n\n436\n00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.500\nIn other words the functionality\ncontinues to degrade.\n\n437\n00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.820\nSo just realize, product activation,\n\n438\n00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.940\nas well as product keys are another thing\nthat we also may have to worry about.\n\n439\n00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:06.770\nJust about every product out there\ntoday has some form of that.\n\n440\n00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.440\nEspecially if you're downloading\nit onto your machine.\n\n441\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.370\nNow, other ones actually do\nit a little bit different.\n\n442\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.400\nLike Microsoft Office.\n\n443\n00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.360\nThat's a software platform instead,\nand that's online.\n\n444\n00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.590\nSoftware as a Service.\n\n445\n00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:22.410\nOffice 365 allows me because I have\nsubscription to it to use it online, in\n\n446\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:28.080\nother words, using my web browser or I can\ndownload a copy of it on to my computer.\n\n447\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.050\nNow, I have five copies\nthat I can download.\n\n448\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.450\nThat's about it.\n\n449\n00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:37.370\nSo now if it sees six copies out there,\nit says look, there's no way,\n\n450\n00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.330\nI'm not gonna actually allow you to\ninstall that on more than five at a time.\n\n451\n00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.770\nWe'll even tell that person, if you\nwant to install this on this computer,\n\n452\n00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.310\nyou need to remove it from one\nof those other five devices.\n\n453\n00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.570\nSo we'll limit you, but\n\n454\n00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.290\nit's actually limiting that license\nto that point of what it needs to be.\n\n455\n00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.981\nThen, we'll also say that if you\ndon't have an Internet connection,\n\n456\n00:23:56.981 --> 00:23:59.933\nI cannot check if this is\nactually a valid copy or not, And\n\n457\n00:23:59.933 --> 00:24:03.340\nyou may also find this functionality\nagain a little bit limited.\n\n458\n00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.050\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat seems like it would help, Ronnie.\n\n459\n00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.860\nIf I understand this right,\nthat would mean that I don't have to\n\n460\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.570\nhave in your example five\ndifferent product keys, right?\n\n461\n00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.740\nIt's just associated with your account,\n\n462\n00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.880\nyour one product key that you mentioned,\nand then it's more like a checkmark.\n\n463\n00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.920\nOkay, you've got one and three\nstrikes against you or, in this case,\n\n464\n00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.080\nfive strikes, I guess.\n\n465\n00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.539\nAnd then after that, it's not that\nyou don't need an additional license,\n\n466\n00:24:24.539 --> 00:24:26.716\nyou just don't get any\nadditional downloads.\n\n467\n00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:30.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that this is\nthe way that the world is starting to go.\n\n468\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.070\nAnd the reason is they don't have\nto distribute media any more,\n\n469\n00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.010\nthey don't have to worry about\na download server a lot of times.\n\n470\n00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.189\nBut even Microsoft Office does that and\nthey're like look,\n\n471\n00:24:38.189 --> 00:24:40.290\nwe know that you may wanna\ndownload this to five machines.\n\n472\n00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.976\nPerfectly fine,\njust realize that once it hits that five.\n\n473\n00:24:42.976 --> 00:24:46.828\nSo If Wes says look, I'm gonna give\nthis to four of my closest friends and\n\n474\n00:24:46.828 --> 00:24:49.730\nhe only has it on one machine well,\nnow all of a sudden,\n\n475\n00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.425\nhe's like, I need a second machine.\n\n476\n00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:53.664\nHe's gonna have to go and\n\n477\n00:24:53.664 --> 00:24:56.500\nget it removed from one of his\nfriends computers to do so.\n\n478\n00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.190\nIt's not the way that they intended it,\nright?\n\n479\n00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:02.320\nThey intended it for you and your devices\nbecause you're the one that bought it.\n\n480\n00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.084\nBut this way,\n\n481\n00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:07.432\nthey didn't have to worry about the idea\nof handing out a product key to anybody.\n\n482\n00:25:07.432 --> 00:25:11.340\nAll it does is check and verify that\nit's there and it's ready to go.\n\n483\n00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.460\nVery neat system, but\nyou're starting to see more and\n\n484\n00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.430\nmore of this because it's out there and\nit's available.\n\n485\n00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.990\n&gt;&gt; So this distribution model looks like,\nRonnie, that one\n\n486\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.370\nof the things that they're thinking of\ngoing out the gate is anti-piracy, right?\n\n487\n00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.820\nI mean, it looks like they've got it,\na lock on it.\n\n488\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.106\nWe're not giving you multiple installation\nCDs, we're not giving you multiple\n\n489\n00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:33.350\ninstallation instances and\nit helps them keep that in check.\n\n490\n00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.963\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n491\n00:25:33.963 --> 00:25:37.251\nYeah, you can't get\nan installation CD of Office 365.\n\n492\n00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:40.225\nAnd you'll see you'll have to\nconnect to the Internet to do so and\n\n493\n00:25:40.225 --> 00:25:42.550\nthat's what you're doing\nis you connect there and\n\n494\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:45.756\nthen it automatically downloads and\ninstalls it onto your computer.\n\n495\n00:25:45.756 --> 00:25:48.539\nAnd then they activate\nit right from there and\n\n496\n00:25:48.539 --> 00:25:53.449\nyou can manage it through your Office\n365 portal that you'll get access to,\n\n497\n00:25:53.449 --> 00:25:57.050\nto see how many devices that\nOffice has been installed on.\n\n498\n00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.040\nAnd once you hit that limit\nit'll tell you, hey, that's it,\n\n499\n00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.010\nthere's your limit and\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n500\n00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.050\nThe other advantage of this is that it\nupdates automatically as long as you pay\n\n501\n00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:06.792\nthe subscription.\n\n502\n00:26:06.792 --> 00:26:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Very good, very, very good.\n\n503\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.831\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so when you start seeing this,\n\n504\n00:26:09.831 --> 00:26:13.865\nthere's only one other thing that I wanna\nmake sure that we were able to do as well,\n\n505\n00:26:13.865 --> 00:26:16.218\nwhich is your computer can get bloated,\nokay?\n\n506\n00:26:16.218 --> 00:26:17.820\nAnd you might be wondering why.\n\n507\n00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.360\nIt's because there's two particular\nschools of thought here.\n\n508\n00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.583\nOne, especially if\nyou're new at computing,\n\n509\n00:26:23.583 --> 00:26:26.490\nyou're saying everything that you see is,\nwow, that looks neat,\n\n510\n00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.630\nI wanna play with that one day,\nso you download it, okay?\n\n511\n00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.690\nAnd then you install it and you go I'm\ngonna play with that tomorrow, okay?\n\n512\n00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:36.140\nAnd then all of a sudden you've got 50 or\n60 apps onto your computer and\n\n513\n00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.200\nyou've done that.\n\n514\n00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.090\nBut now your machine's slowing\ndown because it's done a lot of\n\n515\n00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.800\nstuff to your machine and there's a lot of\nstuff that it has to handle and do, okay?\n\n516\n00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.950\nSo you have that particular attitude,\nokay?\n\n517\n00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.360\nWell, that's fine and\nthat's what your machine can handle, but\n\n518\n00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.820\na lot of machines can't.\n\n519\n00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.210\nSo the other attitude is fairly\nsimple is that when you don't\n\n520\n00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.160\nneed a program anymore,\nyou need to uninstall the program, okay?\n\n521\n00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.937\nMake it much more efficient for\nyour computer to do so.\n\n522\n00:27:02.937 --> 00:27:04.276\nSo let's show you that aspect,\n\n523\n00:27:04.276 --> 00:27:07.135\nin other words how do we get\nrid of programs we don't need.\n\n524\n00:27:07.135 --> 00:27:08.935\nSo let's take a look here, okay.\n\n525\n00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:11.305\nSo here on my Windows 7 machine, well,\n\n526\n00:27:11.305 --> 00:27:13.475\nthere's a couple of\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n527\n00:27:13.475 --> 00:27:17.933\nLet me go ahead and click on Start, and\nthen let me go to All Programs here, and\n\n528\n00:27:17.933 --> 00:27:19.522\nlet's take a look, okay?\n\n529\n00:27:19.522 --> 00:27:23.711\nSo if I go to Start and All Programs and\nI just went ahead and did this for\n\n530\n00:27:23.711 --> 00:27:27.397\nthe application we installed at\nthe beginning of this kind of\n\n531\n00:27:27.397 --> 00:27:29.799\nlittle mini-series here in part one.\n\n532\n00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:32.167\nNotice there's Tftpd32 and\n\n533\n00:27:32.167 --> 00:27:38.210\nalong with this is a little tiny link\nin here that says Uninstall, okay?\n\n534\n00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:43.270\nSo if I select that,\nthat will give me that ability to run this\n\n535\n00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:49.510\nuninstall application that will now say,\nlook, here it's the standalone edition.\n\n536\n00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.838\nAnd I can uninstall it,\nand click Close, okay?\n\n537\n00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:57.003\nAnd this is actually something\nthat the application developer has\n\n538\n00:27:57.003 --> 00:28:00.348\nalso considered to remove\nany of the other additional\n\n539\n00:28:00.348 --> 00:28:04.082\nthings that Tftpd32 had\nactually kinda locked in there.\n\n540\n00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:07.195\nIt says here's the uninstaller, go ahead\nand find all the stuff and remove it,\n\n541\n00:28:07.195 --> 00:28:09.090\nhopefully not affecting your system.\n\n542\n00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.058\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nI've gone to that Start Menu before and\n\n543\n00:28:11.058 --> 00:28:14.324\nI know there's times that I look for an\napplication to have an uninstaller in it.\n\n544\n00:28:14.324 --> 00:28:17.500\nAnd it doesn't have one present and\nam I just stuck here,\n\n545\n00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.358\ndo I have to leave this\napplication on my computer?\n\n546\n00:28:20.358 --> 00:28:22.282\n&gt;&gt; It depends on the application.\n\n547\n00:28:22.282 --> 00:28:25.320\nIf it's malware,\nmore than likely yes, okay?\n\n548\n00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.073\nBut a lot of times because it\ndoesn't have an uninstaller,\n\n549\n00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:30.230\nthere is a way you can\nmanually do this as well.\n\n550\n00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:31.965\nAnd that's what we're going to\nshow you is this other way, okay?\n\n551\n00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:36.098\nSo, if I click on Start and\nthen I select Control Panel and\n\n552\n00:28:36.098 --> 00:28:39.982\ninside Control Panel,\nwell, no, let me make sure.\n\n553\n00:28:39.982 --> 00:28:41.585\nThere we go, okay?\n\n554\n00:28:41.585 --> 00:28:46.825\nSo right underneath Programs, well,\nlook at that Uninstall a program.\n\n555\n00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:53.008\nSo if I go ahead and select that link,\nThen I can scroll out here and this\n\n556\n00:28:53.008 --> 00:28:58.430\nis where you can take a look at a list of\ndifferent programs that you can uninstall.\n\n557\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:59.158\nAnd hopefully,\n\n558\n00:28:59.158 --> 00:29:03.295\nthe one that you're looking to uninstall\nis actually gonna be listed right here.\n\n559\n00:29:03.295 --> 00:29:08.305\nAnd you simply select it like this and\nthen you click Uninstall.\n\n560\n00:29:08.305 --> 00:29:12.936\nAnd from that point, it should begin the\nprocess of uninstalling that particular\n\n561\n00:29:12.936 --> 00:29:13.950\nprogram for you.\n\n562\n00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.167\nIt might take a long time,\nit might be almost instantaneous.\n\n563\n00:29:16.167 --> 00:29:18.761\nYou just never know,\nIt depends on the size of the program.\n\n564\n00:29:18.761 --> 00:29:23.332\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, that information would\nhave come in really, really handy and\n\n565\n00:29:23.332 --> 00:29:26.225\nsaved me probably an hour or\ntwo of looking for\n\n566\n00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:30.585\nan uninstaller and how I can get\nthis application off of my machine.\n\n567\n00:29:30.585 --> 00:29:33.374\nRonnie, looking at the time it does\nlook like we're coming to the end of\n\n568\n00:29:33.374 --> 00:29:34.360\nanother great episode.\n\n569\n00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.510\nBut before we sign off,\ndo you have any parting words of wisdom?\n\n570\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.011\n&gt;&gt; Well, just kind of realize that you're\ngonna be working with applications on that\n\n571\n00:29:41.011 --> 00:29:41.972\nday-to-day basis.\n\n572\n00:29:41.972 --> 00:29:46.147\nThe better that you can actually kind of\nunderstand what type of application you're\n\n573\n00:29:46.147 --> 00:29:50.380\nworking in and understand some of that,\nthat we've been talking about here.\n\n574\n00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.560\nAnd what those programs do, the better off\nyou're gonna be as you continue to work.\n\n575\n00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.636\nDon't be afraid of applications but,\nat the same time,\n\n576\n00:29:57.636 --> 00:30:01.626\ndo be careful especially when you're\ndownloading and installing them.\n\n577\n00:30:01.626 --> 00:30:04.743\nCuz if you don't, you could end up with\nsomething worse on your computer and\n\n578\n00:30:04.743 --> 00:30:07.140\nthat's something we don't\nwant to have happen.\n\n579\n00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.324\n&gt;&gt; Well, great words of wisdom there.\n\n580\n00:30:08.324 --> 00:30:11.742\nWe thank you for that and we do appreciate\nhaving you here in the studio, but\n\n581\n00:30:11.742 --> 00:30:14.634\nthat does look like its a good\nstopping point for this episode.\n\n582\n00:30:14.634 --> 00:30:18.046\nSo we're gonna take our time\nto sign out here at ITProTV.\n\n583\n00:30:18.046 --> 00:30:19.215\nI've been your host Wes Bryant.\n\n584\n00:30:19.215 --> 00:30:20.330\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n585\n00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.294\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n586\n00:30:21.294 --> 00:30:27.719\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:18.040\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode here\nITPRO.TV, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n4\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.000\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at IC3, key applications.\n\n5\n00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.930\nYou guys have already seen some\nother detailed application types.\n\n6\n00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.660\nBut specifically in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.060\nwe're gonna be looking at productivity\napplications, because guess what?\n\n8\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.455\nWhen we go to our jobs,\nsometimes our employers expect us to be,\n\n9\n00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:38.610\nwell, productive.\n\n10\n00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.010\nSo to help us learn how to be productive\nwe have the wonderful Ronnie Wong\n\n11\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.290\nwith us in studio today.\n\n12\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.600\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.865\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you, and\nthank you for the compliment.\n\n14\n00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:49.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful I'm not so sure about.\n\n15\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.560\nBut we are here to learn\na little bit more.\n\n16\n00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.450\nAnd we are grateful to be right here,\n\n17\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.330\nbecause a lot of times when we\nstart working with computers\n\n18\n00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.740\none of the things that ends up happening\nis that you realize something.\n\n19\n00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.530\nAs much as we've learned about\noperating systems in the IC3 series, we\n\n20\n00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.260\nnormally don't do a lot in the operating\nsystems when we're working for a company.\n\n21\n00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.890\nWe tend to actually end up working with\napplications the majority of the time.\n\n22\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.070\nAnd if you end up working in an office\nwhere they're actually gonna\n\n23\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.720\nrequire you to do things\nlike crunch some numbers,\n\n24\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.670\nin other words keep track\nof a lot of numbers.\n\n25\n00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.850\nOr they're gonna require\nyou to do some typing.\n\n26\n00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.280\nOr they may actually make you do\nsomething like a presentation and\n\n27\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.240\nyou're having to do all this stuff,\nmore than likely you're gonna be\n\n28\n00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.440\nworking with what we call\na productivity type of application.\n\n29\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.740\nAnd that goal and\nthe idea is actually simple, right?\n\n30\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.370\nWe have talked about this before in\na previous show, previous episode.\n\n31\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.000\nWe talked about games versus the idea\nof productivity a little bit.\n\n32\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.490\nWell of course that means\nwe need to center in and\n\n33\n00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.610\nspecifically talk about\nthis idea of productivity.\n\n34\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.190\nIt's simple, we actually have certain\nthings that allow us to accomplish things\n\n35\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.340\nfor our business to succeed and\ndo what needs to be done.\n\n36\n00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.240\nAnd that is we're gonna spend the majority\nof our times and the key application\n\n37\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.110\nseries so that we can learn more\nabout this productivity this week.\n\n38\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.950\nBy far, you're probably wondering,\nwell why Microsoft Office?\n\n39\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.730\nThere's many different\nproductivity suites out there.\n\n40\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.917\nAnd that is because this is probably one\nof the most prolific test suites that's\n\n41\n00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:16.480\nactually out there in the world today.\n\n42\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.200\nYou tend to see in just every office\nbuilding that's actually out there.\n\n43\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.710\nAny place that you tend to see Microsoft\n\n44\n00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.490\ncomputer you're probably gonna see some\ntype of Microsoft office product on there.\n\n45\n00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.260\nSo is you ever heard of Microsoft Word or\nMicrosoft Excel, or PowerPoint or Access.\n\n46\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.380\nAnything like that, that's what we're\nnormally talking about because this is\n\n47\n00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.620\nnormally what we have to\ndo in terms of business.\n\n48\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.730\nAnd that's what we're gonna be focusing\non today is actually introduce you\n\n49\n00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.070\nto what we call that idea of\nthe entirety of Microsoft Office itself.\n\n50\n00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.650\nSo there's a lot of different\nprograms out there.\n\n51\n00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.090\nAnd at times, Cherokee,\nit seems to be a little bit overwhelming.\n\n52\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.630\nAnd that's what we're here to actually\ntalk about a little bit as well.\n\n53\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.380\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nlet's go ahead and get started.\n\n54\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.650\n&gt;&gt; All right so as we get started,\none of the key things that I want\n\n55\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.490\nto make sure that you understand as you\nstart to kind of move into this realm\n\n56\n00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.740\nwhere you're working with a computer\non a daily basis, is to become more\n\n57\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.400\nfamiliar with the Microsoft Office\nproducts themselves, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.090\nAnd you might be wondering,\nman that's four different products.\n\n59\n00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.530\nDo I have to learn all four?\n\n60\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.590\nWell, it would behoove you to, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.470\nIt'd be to your advantage if you learned\nhow to take advantage of these programs.\n\n62\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.300\n&gt;&gt; You may accidentally\nbecome more efficient,\n\n63\n00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.083\nis what Ronnie is trying to tell you.\n\n64\n00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:28.820\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n65\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.070\nby just the idea of being thrown\nin to the deep end of things.\n\n66\n00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.220\nWhere they're saying,\nlet's open up Microsoft Word and\n\n67\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.490\nstart typing out what you need to.\n\n68\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.140\nAnd don't get me wrong,\nyou can learn a lot that way, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.320\nA lot of us end up\nlearning a lot that way.\n\n70\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.870\nEspecially in programs like Excel,\nand even PowerPoint,\n\n71\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.118\nwhich is the most\nintuitive of the programs.\n\n72\n00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:49.550\nBut overall though, we wanna make sure\nthat you understand how these work.\n\n73\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.140\nAnd the great thing about it,\n\n74\n00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.440\nis you're gonna learn something neat\nduring the show, at least I hope so.\n\n75\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.390\nAnd that's something we\nwanna take a look at.\n\n76\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.450\n&gt;&gt; Being able just to navigate through the\ndifferent tools that you've see available\n\n77\n00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.050\nto you, is really just gonna help\nmaking your life a lot easier as well.\n\n78\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.690\nSo let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n79\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and speaking of that idea of\nnavigation that's what we're really\n\n80\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.255\nfocusing on.\n\n81\n00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:13.430\nYou're gonna learn something\nvery neat like I said.\n\n82\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.400\n&gt;&gt; Is once you actually learn how to\ndo it in one application, the majority\n\n83\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.170\nof what you tend to see as the interface,\nand we'll describe what that means.\n\n84\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.520\nYou're gonna see that it carries\nthrough to all the applications.\n\n85\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.870\nSo let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n86\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.690\nSo on my screen, I've got my\nWindows 7 computer up and running.\n\n87\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.230\nAnd we need to make sure that we can get\naccess to our Office productivity suite.\n\n88\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.830\n&gt;&gt; So when you get hired into a company\nand they're saying, here's your computer.\n\n89\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.030\nAnd they're saying all right, so\nwhat we're gonna first do is, of course,\n\n90\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.090\nget access to it.\n\n91\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.020\nSo the way that we find it out, if your\nscreen looks a little bit different than\n\n92\n00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.080\nwhat mine does, that's gonna be fine.\n\n93\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.260\nBut we need to figure\nout how to get there.\n\n94\n00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so Ronnie with this\nparticular operating system I notice\n\n95\n00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.720\nyou're using a Windows operating system.\n\n96\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.180\nIs this something we shouldn't\nexpect on all operating systems or\n\n97\n00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.880\nwould this be a peeve product?\n\n98\n00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well when it comes down\nto Microsoft Office itself,\n\n99\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.050\nyour program itself is a paid product.\n\n100\n00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.850\nBut the great thing is\nyou don't have to pay for\n\n101\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.540\nit normally when you're working for\na company They went ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.630\npurchased licenses for everybody that\nthey've installed it on the computer for.\n\n103\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.640\nSo that's not something you really\nhave to worry about too much.\n\n104\n00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.020\nNow if you tend to bring it home, and\n\n105\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.600\nyou go,\nI really like working with that program.\n\n106\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.490\nThen yes, at some point you may actually\nchoose to go out and purchase it yourself.\n\n107\n00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.300\nThat can be a little more expensive but\n\n108\n00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.500\nit's something that you\nmight choose to do.\n\n109\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Actually, Microsoft now offers a Cloud\nbased option, which is really cool.\n\n110\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.158\nSo I can purchase,\nI pay on a monthly basis to go ahead and\n\n111\n00:05:38.158 --> 00:05:42.566\nhave Office 365 on up to five\ndevices in my home, so with kids and\n\n112\n00:05:42.566 --> 00:05:45.507\nlaptops I definitely\nsee the value in that.\n\n113\n00:05:45.507 --> 00:05:49.518\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's no doubt that a lot of\nthe way that the applications are running\n\n114\n00:05:49.518 --> 00:05:53.407\ntoday is that even though you'll see\nthat they're installed on My Machine\n\n115\n00:05:53.407 --> 00:05:56.640\nright here, which is what I'm\nabout to show you here, okay?\n\n116\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.230\nIs you'll also end up seeing that you\ncan do what Cherokee is talking about,\n\n117\n00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.440\nwhich are cloud based applications.\n\n118\n00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.630\nAnd that simply means it comes across\non your browser at this point.\n\n119\n00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.800\nBut they also give you the option to\nessentially rent the software for your\n\n120\n00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.050\nown personal computer in that use if you\nintend to purchase an Office 365 license.\n\n121\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.880\nAnd if you don't pay for it,\n\n122\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.810\nwell after a while you just won't get\nthe license to be able to use it anymore.\n\n123\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.490\nAnd it will just stop functioning\nthe way that you want it to.\n\n124\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.070\nBut at this point let's just make\nsure that we can navigate to it.\n\n125\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.945\nSo I just clicked on the Start button\nin the lower left hand corner.\n\n126\n00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:29.611\nAnd Windows 7,\neven though it's still a couple of\n\n127\n00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:32.587\ngenerations behind from\nthe current operating system,\n\n128\n00:06:32.587 --> 00:06:35.752\nyou'll probably see a lot of\nbusinesses are still using it.\n\n129\n00:06:35.752 --> 00:06:39.292\nAnd learning techniques here are also\ngonna help you as you do get into\n\n130\n00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:41.428\nthe world of computing\non a daily basis for\n\n131\n00:06:41.428 --> 00:06:44.501\nyour work that whether WIndows 7 or\nWindows 10.\n\n132\n00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:47.704\nIt should feel a bit familiar,\nit may look different but\n\n133\n00:06:47.704 --> 00:06:52.079\nyou should be able to find a lot of things\nout So I'm gonna click on programs.\n\n134\n00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:56.690\nAnd once I click on programs what you'll\nnormally end up seeing is right here\n\n135\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.160\nin the default install is what\nwe call Microsoft Office.\n\n136\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.080\nIt'll be in a subfolder and if I click on\nthat you'll actually end up seeing that\n\n137\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.530\nthere's a lot of different programs.\n\n138\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.360\nNow the ones that we're gonna focus on,\nreally for productivity.\n\n139\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.790\nWe're gonna take a look at,\nlet's start off with this one,\n\n140\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.590\nwhich is probably the most common,\nwhich is Microsoft Word 2010.\n\n141\n00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.730\nThat's gonna be a word processing program.\n\n142\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.690\nSo if you're having to copy documents, or\n\n143\n00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.820\nactually type out documents,\nthis is the one that you're gonna be on or\n\n144\n00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.540\nbusiness letters,\nyou're gonna end up seeing that too.\n\n145\n00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.600\n&gt;&gt; And so Rooney,\n2010 is just specifying the year.\n\n146\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.590\nWe're currently at 2016, but\nthey're very similar in the way that\n\n147\n00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.110\nthese applications work maybe\nsome new updated features.\n\n148\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.364\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that a lot of\nthe features that are newer that are more\n\n149\n00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:47.292\nevolved really do revolve around\nthe idea that your company is moving to\n\n150\n00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:50.182\ncloud based applications\nmore than anything else.\n\n151\n00:07:50.182 --> 00:07:53.252\nA lot of these companies that\nhave been around for a long time,\n\n152\n00:07:53.252 --> 00:07:56.264\nyou may find out that they're\nstill operating on 2010,\n\n153\n00:07:56.264 --> 00:07:59.890\nespecially in other parts of the world\nBesides just right here in the US.\n\n154\n00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:00.613\nAnd why?\n\n155\n00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:03.480\nIt's because it's expensive\nto upgrade these license.\n\n156\n00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.280\nSo, most comments, we can be fine with\nOffice 2010, why not leave it there.\n\n157\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.350\n&gt;&gt; It works.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n158\n00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.820\n&gt;&gt; If it's not broke, don't fix it.\n\n159\n00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n160\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.430\nSo now, if we have Word but\nprobably the most popular program\n\n161\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.470\nin the entire Office Suite Is one\nwhat we call the Microsoft Excel.\n\n162\n00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.290\nThis is working with spreadsheets so\na lot of different number crunching.\n\n163\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.890\nSo, we're gonna end up seeing this on a\nepisode where we're talking about word or\n\n164\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.920\nExcel.\n\n165\n00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.150\nThose are gonna be separate\nepisodes on to themselves.\n\n166\n00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.890\nWe're gonna get much more detailed.\n\n167\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.490\nWe'll just gonna show you some\nnavigation features they.\n\n168\n00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.890\nAnd then we're also going to end up\ntaking a look of course at PowerPoint.\n\n169\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.740\nThis is by far the most intuitive program,\n\n170\n00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.020\nif you have to do any type of presentation\nit's going to help you out there.\n\n171\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.890\nAnd then we're going to focus on Access.\n\n172\n00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.900\nNow, you might say Ronnie what\nare all these other things that\n\n173\n00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.010\nare out there okay.\n\n174\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.610\nThere are plenty of other programs\ndepending on what the level\n\n175\n00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.060\nof the Office suite that\nyour company purchases.\n\n176\n00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.020\nSo, you might find out\nyou only have those four,\n\n177\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.070\nyou might find out you\nonly have two of them.\n\n178\n00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.980\nBut just kind of realize that\nit does depend on what you have.\n\n179\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.740\nSo, I have what's called\nthe Office Professional Suite,\n\n180\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.600\nwhich is that entirety of\nall those programs there.\n\n181\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.570\nAnd it includes in things like\nif you're designing forms.\n\n182\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.710\nAnd then there's Outlook here,\nwhich is of course,\n\n183\n00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:22.170\na communications program, for email,\nand of course, also a calendar program.\n\n184\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.220\n&gt;&gt; Calendar, right.\nYeah.\n\n185\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.560\nWe even have Microsoft Publisher,\nif you're publishing a small newsletter.\n\n186\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.440\nYou can even do things like that.\n\n187\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.940\nBut we're really going to focus\non the four that we mentioned.\n\n188\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.820\nSo, even though you're looking like\nRonnie, you just haven't spent any time in\n\n189\n00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.280\nnavigating, that's because we really\nonly have to look at one program and\n\n190\n00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.310\nthen we'll show you those same features\nare the same in other programs as well.\n\n191\n00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.400\nSo, as long as you learn about one,\n\n192\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.160\nyou're gonna find out that when\nyou get into that environment and\n\n193\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.570\nthey say hey bring this up, you're\ngonna feel more comfortable navigating.\n\n194\n00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.440\nSo, I like using Microsoft Word because\nthat's the one that I started off in\n\n195\n00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.860\nwhen we start about the idea\nhere of using a program.\n\n196\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.780\nSo, when we start taking a look\nat what we call the interface,\n\n197\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.830\nthat's the screen that you're gonna\nbe interacting with on a daily basis.\n\n198\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.660\nWe wanna make sure you\nunderstand some of the features\n\n199\n00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.400\nthat you're gonna end up seeing.\n\n200\n00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.110\nAnd remember that once you see it here,\n\n201\n00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.650\nit's gonna be across multiple\nprograms as well, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.100\nSo, let's start off up here at\nthe very top as what we wanna see and\n\n203\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.840\nlet me see if I can zoom\nin just a little bit more.\n\n204\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.370\n&gt;&gt; So, what you're saying Ronnie here\nis that these icons are gonna look\n\n205\n00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.680\nvery familiar to me if I see them,\n\n206\n00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.950\nI learn them in one program then I can\nexpect to see them again in PowerPoint?\n\n207\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're gonna see that\nacross the entirety of the suite.\n\n208\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.660\nAnd they made that, that way which\nis strange the way that I word it.\n\n209\n00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.670\nThey made it that way,\n\n210\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.330\nthat's what I should say So\nthat you would feel comfortable.\n\n211\n00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.910\nRegardless of where you\nare at your skill set level.\n\n212\n00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.550\nThat moving between programs,\n\n213\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.280\nyou're really not doing a lot\nof things that are different.\n\n214\n00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.340\nBut just the most essential things that\nare different that you have to learn.\n\n215\n00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.380\nBut the navigation between them is\nactually gonna be fairly common, right?\n\n216\n00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:02.050\n&gt;&gt; So, this could be considered\na user-friendly user interface, or\n\n217\n00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.310\na user-centric interface\n&gt;&gt; No doubt that it really does help.\n\n218\n00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.990\nYou know whether you're\nat the beginning level or\n\n219\n00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.550\nacross more advanced level, the feature\nis being the same as kind of the key.\n\n220\n00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:17.020\nNow, sometimes it could be so much so\nthat it's hard to distinguish programs.\n\n221\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.850\nSo, right here at the very top when we\nstart to see this, notice right here I'm\n\n222\n00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.690\ngonna see if I can zoom in a little\nbit more, we'll see that right there.\n\n223\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:28.020\nIt normally tells you the name of the\nprogram that you're in, that's always key,\n\n224\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.210\nbecause lot of times, if you don't know\nthe name of the program that you're in,\n\n225\n00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.610\nyou may actual end up going, I don't\nthink I'm suppose to be in that program.\n\n226\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.740\nSo, always make sure that\nyou're in a right program.\n\n227\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.010\nThe other one that's key up\nhere at the very top is also\n\n228\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.880\nthis which is gonna be\nwhat called the file name.\n\n229\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.020\nNow, when it comes down to a file,\nwhat do we talk about is whatever the work\n\n230\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.810\nthat we're working on and we wanna make\nthat as a contained unit of information.\n\n231\n00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.280\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna end up saving it and\ngiving that thing a name.\n\n232\n00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.750\nSo, even though I don't have anything on\nthis page, if I wanted to I can go ahead\n\n233\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:02.920\nand click on this little disk up here\nwhere it says save, okay, right there and\n\n234\n00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.750\nnotice how easy it is for us to do that,\nand then I'm gonna give it a name and\n\n235\n00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:13.590\nI'm just gonna call this\none my IC 3 Test document.\n\n236\n00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.810\nAnd then, make sure I know\nexactly where that's saved.\n\n237\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:19.700\nGotta lock up.\n&gt;&gt; Are there any\n\n238\n00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.470\ncharacters that we shouldn't really\nuse when we're naming our files?\n\n239\n00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.610\nOr anything like that?\n\n240\n00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes and no right?\n\n241\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.540\nYou wanna make sure you named\nthem something descriptive.\n\n242\n00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.990\nYou don't wanna name them\nanything too generic.\n\n243\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.040\nBut most of the characters\ncan be accepted today.\n\n244\n00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.160\nIf you type in something, and you decide\nyou're gonna use the little accent marks,\n\n245\n00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.420\nand stuff like that.\n\n246\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.600\nIf it doesn't take it,\nit will tell you, you can't use that.\n\n247\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.430\nSo, don't worry too much about that one,\nbut just kind of realize.\n\n248\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.440\nAnd so it doesn't even matter\nif it's case sensitive or not,\n\n249\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.220\nin terms of the naming unless\nyour company requires you to\n\n250\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.720\nhave a special naming convention\nyou'll definitely have to follow that.\n\n251\n00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.120\nBut now notice up here at the top\nagain where it's now changed.\n\n252\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.050\nAnd so, now I know that I'm working\non that specific document or\n\n253\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.390\nthat specific file and now all the changes\nthat I make here they'll actually carry\n\n254\n00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.060\nalong with this as long as I end\nup saving that over here too.\n\n255\n00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.670\nAnd we'll show you multiple\nways where we can do things.\n\n256\n00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.210\nThe other features that\nare fairly the same, of course,\n\n257\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.690\nis this top bar that I've been pointing\nout here, is what we call the Title Bar.\n\n258\n00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.510\nIt allows us to navigate\nthe entire program itself.\n\n259\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.670\nSo, if I click on that, and using my\nmouse, I click and then I can drag.\n\n260\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.500\nAnd notice how I can\nmove the entire program\n\n261\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.860\nby simply moving it\naround across the screen.\n\n262\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.050\nNow, that's not the only\nnavigation feature that I have.\n\n263\n00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.490\nRight here, this is what is\ncalled the restore down state.\n\n264\n00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:44.060\nAnd that means it's not full\nscreen on the window itself.\n\n265\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.960\nIt's in the original side that it launched\nup as when I first launched it up.\n\n266\n00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.910\nBut on the right hand corner over here,\nokay,\n\n267\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.850\nI have three different options\navailable to me right here.\n\n268\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.480\nOkay?\n\n269\n00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.760\nNow, if I hover over that option,\nwe actually end up seeing,\n\n270\n00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.320\nlet me see if there actually\nthere it goes, okay.\n\n271\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.540\nIt actually says it's close and\n\n272\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.990\nthat will close out the entire\nprogram itself as well as that file.\n\n273\n00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.780\nAnd then-\n&gt;&gt; But.\n\n274\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.030\n&gt;&gt; I have this other\none which is maximize.\n\n275\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.560\n&gt;&gt; That's for that little other icon\ncomes in the play that you showed us\n\n276\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.860\nbefore, right Ronnie?\n\n277\n00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.490\nWhich little icon are we\ntalking about here?\n\n278\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.790\n&gt;&gt; The old floppy disk drive.\n\n279\n00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.741\n&gt;&gt; The old floppy disk drive over here.\n\n280\n00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:24.549\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because if you hit close and\nyou haven't saved your work,\n\n281\n00:14:24.549 --> 00:14:26.670\nthat could be a very disastrous event.\n\n282\n00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.160\n&gt;&gt; It really can and that's why\nat some point in time they said,\n\n283\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.230\nlook, they're gonna at\nleast give you a warning.\n\n284\n00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.760\n&gt;&gt; A notification.\n\n285\n00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.000\n&gt;&gt; So, let me change something\nhere.So if I accidentally do this,\n\n286\n00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.630\nwhich is really nice and\nit makes you think about this.\n\n287\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.080\nIf I now click here, I'll try and\nclick it again, okay.\n\n288\n00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.780\nNotice it gives me a warning dialog box.\n\n289\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.490\nIt says, look you made some changes here\nand that could be simply as you hitting\n\n290\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:52.190\na space bar or adding in just a period at\nsome point and saying I recognized that\n\n291\n00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.640\nthere is a change, do you want to save\nit or don't you Well that's up to you.\n\n292\n00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.740\nYou need to be very careful, if you choose\nnot to save and you've done a lot of work,\n\n293\n00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.590\nthat could actually take you a lot of\ntime to reproduce so just be careful\n\n294\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.570\nwhen you start to actually mess around\nwith something like that as well.\n\n295\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:12.140\nThe other one is just a button right here\nwhich would change, let me show you.\n\n296\n00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.980\nNotice how, right now,\nit's actually called the Maximize button.\n\n297\n00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.560\nIt's kind of got this little square here.\n\n298\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.840\nIf I click on that, and\nthis went full-screen.\n\n299\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.040\nLet me zoom out so that we can see it.\n\n300\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.590\nAnd you'll now see that if I zoom\nback in on this feature, and\n\n301\n00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.870\nI think it's actually, there we go.\n\n302\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:27.610\nOkay.\n\n303\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.030\nNotice the name has changed as well and,\n\n304\n00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.740\nthere we go It's now\nchanged to restore down.\n\n305\n00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.230\nSo, this will allow me to zoom\nback out and bring it back.\n\n306\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.680\nSo, that button right there can\nactually maximize or restore down.\n\n307\n00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.375\nMay wonder like, why do I need to do this?\n\n308\n00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:46.753\nIf I'm working only intently on one,\nokay, I might go ahead and\n\n309\n00:15:46.753 --> 00:15:49.569\nfull screen on this and\nmake my focus entirely there or\n\n310\n00:15:49.569 --> 00:15:53.135\nif I want to restore down I might be\nopening up other applications and\n\n311\n00:15:53.135 --> 00:15:57.225\nI want to see those too Yeah,\nbecause we're talking about multi-tasking.\n\n312\n00:15:57.225 --> 00:16:01.488\nI'm sure you guys have heard that term and\nit's something that you do oftentimes when\n\n313\n00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:04.340\nyou're in a work environment or\neven at home.\n\n314\n00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.320\nAnd one of the features that I used\nall the time in a Windows environment,\n\n315\n00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.840\nprobably one of my favorites, is holding\ndown the Windows key on the keyboard and\n\n316\n00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.780\nthen holding down either the left arrow or\n\n317\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.290\nthe right arrow,\nonce you're clicked inside of a window.\n\n318\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.660\nSo, you could snap this entire window\nto the left side of the screen or\n\n319\n00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.980\nthe right side of the screen.\n\n320\n00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.830\nBut what I'm getting at here, is that's\nsomething called a keyboard shortcut.\n\n321\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.328\nAnd do yourself a favor, and\njust Google keyboard shortcuts, and\n\n322\n00:16:29.328 --> 00:16:31.399\nthat's really gonna help you as well.\n\n323\n00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:34.669\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're gonna end up seeing that\nthere's shortcuts that actually reside\n\n324\n00:16:34.669 --> 00:16:36.550\neverywhere across the screen here.\n\n325\n00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.318\nAnd we'll actually take a look at\nthem as we continue to navigate.\n\n326\n00:16:39.318 --> 00:16:41.930\nI'm kind of trying to make sure that we're\n\n327\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.480\ncomprehensive because we\ncover the scope of things.\n\n328\n00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.040\nSo, those are normally our navigations.\n\n329\n00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.655\nWe of course can actually\nminimize the whole thing and\n\n330\n00:16:48.655 --> 00:16:50.518\nnow looks like it's actually disappeared.\n\n331\n00:16:50.518 --> 00:16:53.990\nWell, even though it disappeared from the\nscreen it's still open in the background\n\n332\n00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.720\nand I can see it down here on the taskbar.\n\n333\n00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.740\nIt's actually part and\n\n334\n00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.120\nit actually even gives me a little\npreview window that shows me, that hey,\n\n335\n00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.950\nyou didn't closed out a program you\njust kinda parked it down here.\n\n336\n00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.060\nJust by clicking back on it,\nof course it actually comes back up and\n\n337\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.750\nwe can see that as well.\n\n338\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.940\nNow, in terms of navigation,\na couple of other things, okay?\n\n339\n00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.090\nThe next layer's down here, okay?\n\n340\n00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.550\nThese are what we call our tabs, and\n\n341\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:21.260\nthis is what's called a ribbon right\nacross the top here as well, okay?\n\n342\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.180\nEach of these tabs corresponds\nto a ribbon and so notice that\n\n343\n00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.800\nthe file is actually the only one that\nkind of covers up the entire screen, okay?\n\n344\n00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.020\nSo, if I click on file, it's usually a\ndifferent color tab, so if I click on file\n\n345\n00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.260\nthat covers the entire screen and\nI can't work with the application at all.\n\n346\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.740\nBut notice if I click on Home,\n\n347\n00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.690\nit doesn't cover anything on the actual\nworking document that I have.\n\n348\n00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.430\nAnd that's because everything\nis across the top of the screen.\n\n349\n00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.460\nBack in earlier versions of Windows,\nthey used to have menus.\n\n350\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.009\nAnd those menus would drop down and\n\n351\n00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:55.422\ncover part of what you were\nactually taking a look at.\n\n352\n00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:59.174\nAnd so now with these different ribbons\nthat only reside on the top portion of\n\n353\n00:17:59.174 --> 00:18:02.409\nthe screen, you don't have to\nactually do that anymore as well.\n\n354\n00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:05.672\nSo there's a Home, there's an Insert,\nthere's a Page Layout,\n\n355\n00:18:05.672 --> 00:18:09.170\nthere's a Reference,\nthere's Mailing, Review and View.\n\n356\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.130\nNot every program will have every single\none of these tabs, but just kind of\n\n357\n00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:18.590\nrealize that they do represent different\nthings that we can do with that program.\n\n358\n00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:25.110\nMajority of time, you'll see Home,\nInsert, Page Layout and View as kind\n\n359\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.910\nof the common ones that will allow you to\nactually manipulate and change there too.\n\n360\n00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.160\nAll right, so we have this File tab and\non this File tab here,\n\n361\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.480\nnotice that it actually ends up\nexpanding our that entire ribbon\n\n362\n00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.690\nall the way where it covers the screen and\nI can't even see my document anymore.\n\n363\n00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:46.960\nBut all these other tabs, though, notice\nthat they don't cover the page at all.\n\n364\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.220\nSo without covering the page, it allows me\nto continue to see whatever I need to and\n\n365\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.740\nnot have to worry that it cover up\nsomething because in the past other\n\n366\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.817\nprevious versions of Office, they would\nend up covering part of the screen and\n\n367\n00:18:58.817 --> 00:19:01.319\nthen you had to kinda go,\nwhat was I doing?\n\n368\n00:19:01.319 --> 00:19:02.825\nAnd then you'd look back and\n\n369\n00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:06.212\nthen you'd forget what you actually\nwere trying to go to, and so\n\n370\n00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:10.540\nnow everything that's across the top, all\nthe tools that we can use to manipulate\n\n371\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.060\nthe document here, whatever we're\nworking on, is all right here as well.\n\n372\n00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.580\nNow, the other thing you're gonna end up\nseeing is that these icons can end up\n\n373\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.200\nchanging depending on\nthe resolution of your screen.\n\n374\n00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.830\nSo, right here a lot of this looks\na little bit kind of smooshed in.\n\n375\n00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.870\nSo, you'll notice how it's kind\nof very much smooshed in here and\n\n376\n00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.950\nyou're not actually seeing a lot.\n\n377\n00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:37.160\nBut, if you actually do have a deeper\nresolution or a bigger resolution, you'll\n\n378\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.850\nsee that it add in some more description\nand some more elements and actually\n\n379\n00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.018\nmakes it look a little bit nicer and\nneater to when you start seeing things.\n\n380\n00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:49.160\nNow, remember that Cherokee also\npointed out the ability to navigate and\n\n381\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.830\nusing shortcuts.\n\n382\n00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.530\nLet me hover over one of these,\nI'll get a screen tip and\n\n383\n00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.220\nnotice that this one on format painter.\n\n384\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.150\nIt's just one I picked randomly.\n\n385\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.730\nIf I wanted to learn a shortcut, here\nit says, Ctrl, Shift, and the letter C.\n\n386\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.816\nSo, I just look down at my keyboard,\nand I look for that Ctrl button,\n\n387\n00:20:03.816 --> 00:20:06.585\nand I push the Shift button at\nthe same time, and the letter C,\n\n388\n00:20:06.585 --> 00:20:09.020\nand that will allow me to use that tool.\n\n389\n00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.933\nEven if I went over here to Bold,\nnotice this says, Ctrl+B.\n\n390\n00:20:11.933 --> 00:20:16.467\nRight here, we can do the other one, and\nthen there are some very common ones,\n\n391\n00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:18.220\nsuch as cut, copy and paste.\n\n392\n00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.227\nSo, there's Ctrl+X.\n\n393\n00:20:19.227 --> 00:20:20.059\n&gt;&gt; Lifesavers.\n\n394\n00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:23.391\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Ctrl+C, and of course Ctrl+V\n\n395\n00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:28.820\nhere, and they're all in a row on your\nkeyboard, a standard US keyboard.\n\n396\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.748\nBut just kinda realize that you're\ngonna end up navigating across that\n\n397\n00:20:31.748 --> 00:20:33.100\nribbon as well.\n\n398\n00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.820\nThe other navigation features that\nyou'll also end up seeing of course\n\n399\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.940\nare down here at the bottom on\nwhat we call the status bar.\n\n400\n00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.870\nAs you start working with\nmultiple page documents,\n\n401\n00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.230\nit'll tell you what page that you're on.\n\n402\n00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.360\nYou probably will not,\nI can always keep up with that.\n\n403\n00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.924\nBut let's say it's a 30 page document and\nthe 15 pages in the middle, right,\n\n404\n00:20:51.924 --> 00:20:55.496\nthey look all the same, okay,\nif you're just scanning them.\n\n405\n00:20:55.496 --> 00:20:59.190\nWell, this will at least tell you\nwhat page that you're on, and\n\n406\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.980\neven the number of words.\n\n407\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.735\nNow, that's probably more important for\n\n408\n00:21:01.735 --> 00:21:04.036\nthe kids in high school when\nyou have to do 500 words.\n\n409\n00:21:04.036 --> 00:21:05.282\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Name your requirements, yeah?\n\n410\n00:21:05.282 --> 00:21:05.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n411\n00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:10.310\nthey type A 46 times and there it is,\nnearly 10% of those words already done\n\n412\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:15.600\nbecause they had A 46 times in a row,\nthat kind of stuff as well.\n\n413\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.810\nAnd the other one of course that's\nactually down here by default is that it's\n\n414\n00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.910\nnormally doing an autocorrect or\na proofreading as it's going along, so\n\n415\n00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.850\nas we actually have more and\nmore information we'll see that.\n\n416\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:32.030\nNow, in the lower right hand corner\nof the screen where we can't\n\n417\n00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:36.440\nkind of see everything, there we go, now\nwe'll actually zoom in a little bit more.\n\n418\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.330\nWe can change the actual view without\ngoing into the menu with one-click\n\n419\n00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:40.910\nbuttons.\n\n420\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:45.134\nSo we're in, currently what is called,\nthe print-mode, if I remember right or\n\n421\n00:21:45.134 --> 00:21:46.850\nthe screen, let me see.\n\n422\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.350\nGotta zoom out so I can see the.\n\n423\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.100\nYeah, Print Layout and\nso that we can see that.\n\n424\n00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.010\nAnd then there's a Full Reader and\nthen a Web Layout.\n\n425\n00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.420\nSo, each one of these shows you\nwhat the document would look like.\n\n426\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.709\nSo, this one would be,\nof course, how to print and\n\n427\n00:21:58.709 --> 00:22:02.070\nhow would actually it would look if\nyou're reading the document itself and\n\n428\n00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.790\nthen I can come up here to the upper\nright hand corner and close that out.\n\n429\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.658\nAnd then you will have one where it allows\nyou inside of Microsoft Word, I don't know\n\n430\n00:22:09.658 --> 00:22:13.089\nwhy you would choose do this, but you\ncan actually design a web page here and\n\n431\n00:22:13.089 --> 00:22:16.770\nthen it will even show you what it\nshould look like as a web page as well.\n\n432\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.365\nSo, there's many different\nviews that you have available.\n\n433\n00:22:20.365 --> 00:22:22.160\nThen of course, you have Zoom options and\n\n434\n00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.610\nyou can use this little toggle bar\nto be able to zoom in and out.\n\n435\n00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:29.680\nAnd you'll notice that it\nchanges automatically, and\n\n436\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.570\nthis is what we call a live preview of\nhow everything should look as well, okay?\n\n437\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:39.760\nAs your document continues to grow\nin terms of numbers of pages, or\n\n438\n00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.840\neven frames or slides if you're actually\nusing something like PowerPoint,\n\n439\n00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.670\nyou'll end up being able to use this,\nof course,\n\n440\n00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.160\nto navigate through those by just\nsimply clicking and dragging.\n\n441\n00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.037\nOr you can use these arrows, too.\n\n442\n00:22:53.037 --> 00:22:56.986\nAnd all that is just about navigating\naround, making sure that we understand\n\n443\n00:22:56.986 --> 00:23:00.827\nsome of the basic things that need to\nbe done in terms of navigation, okay?\n\n444\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:06.138\nNow, there are of course then and\nonce you start to understand that right.\n\n445\n00:23:06.138 --> 00:23:09.522\nLet's just show you some of the basic\nfunctions that we need to be\n\n446\n00:23:09.522 --> 00:23:13.783\nable to do between every single program\nthat we're gonna talk about in the future\n\n447\n00:23:13.783 --> 00:23:15.312\nin other episodes, right?\n\n448\n00:23:15.312 --> 00:23:19.536\nSo one of the ones I showed you was\nalready there which is simply the idea of\n\n449\n00:23:19.536 --> 00:23:20.760\nsaving.\n\n450\n00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.057\nSo, a couple of ways where we can save\nup here in the upper right hand corner.\n\n451\n00:23:24.057 --> 00:23:28.657\nWe can use that little floppy disk that\nCherokee pointed out that should be able\n\n452\n00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:33.198\nto save, and that's what we call a quick\naccess, a simple one click action.\n\n453\n00:23:33.198 --> 00:23:39.270\nBut I can also go to File and then I have\nthe same option here, to Save and Save As.\n\n454\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.867\nUsually, if you've already given it\na name and you're just updating it,\n\n455\n00:23:42.867 --> 00:23:44.593\nyou simply go ahead and click Save.\n\n456\n00:23:44.593 --> 00:23:48.797\nAnd now, all this jump that I actually\ntyped in down here that's the part of\n\n457\n00:23:48.797 --> 00:23:50.080\nthe document, okay?\n\n458\n00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.306\nAnd that actually changed\nthe document there.\n\n459\n00:23:52.306 --> 00:23:55.603\nBut if this is my first time I\nmight choose save as as well or\n\n460\n00:23:55.603 --> 00:23:58.712\nif I wanted to just save\nit as a different name.\n\n461\n00:23:58.712 --> 00:24:03.090\nAnd that will now create a second\ndocument for me with a different name.\n\n462\n00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.370\n&gt;&gt; Something I really like to\ndo by using the save as feature,\n\n463\n00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:10.750\nRonnie, is to change the default\nlocation where that file is being saved.\n\n464\n00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:15.990\nSo, you might differ and different people\nhave their own personal preference.\n\n465\n00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:20.060\nBut for me, if I'm working on a project,\nand I have some documents that I'm working\n\n466\n00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.940\nwith frequently,\nI like to put them on my desktop.\n\n467\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.870\nSo I can hit Save As and change\nwhere I'm gonna be saving that file,\n\n468\n00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.130\nsave it on my desktop if I know I'm\ngonna be working with it frequently,\n\n469\n00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.675\nuntil I put it in a more\npermanent location.\n\n470\n00:24:32.675 --> 00:24:35.780\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's a great idea, especially\nif you know you're gonna be working with\n\n471\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.710\nthose documents really quickly.\n\n472\n00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.800\nNow the other thing is what we've also\ntaken a look at which is the idea of\n\n473\n00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.740\nclosing out of a document.\n\n474\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.480\nAnd here's what Cherokee's action\nallowed us to do is to put an icon or\n\n475\n00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:52.220\nthe actual file right here represented\nby this icon on my desktop.\n\n476\n00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.300\nNow the advantage of this\nis relatively simple.\n\n477\n00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.980\nIf you start doing stuff like this I don't\nhave to go down to Microsoft Office or\n\n478\n00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:05.341\nwhatever program I'm working in and\nthen go to File and\n\n479\n00:25:05.341 --> 00:25:10.180\nOpen, and\nthen from Open try to navigate to that\n\n480\n00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.750\nfile and then find it and\nthen I can open it up.\n\n481\n00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.380\nI can it that way but\n\n482\n00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.927\nnow that it's actually on the desktop I\ncan simply just double click on it and\n\n483\n00:25:19.927 --> 00:25:24.760\nnotice that that opens up that one file\nbut the entire application as well.\n\n484\n00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.200\nSo we can close it, we can save it and\nwe can actually open up the document and\n\n485\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.530\nmake it actually available\nto us very quickly\n\n486\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.615\nbecause people at Microsoft actually\nthought about this stuff as well.\n\n487\n00:25:35.615 --> 00:25:38.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, the other feature, of course,\n\n488\n00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.980\nthat you should know how to do is\nthe idea of what we call printing.\n\n489\n00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:46.350\nSo there's a couple of things here\nwhen you start the idea of printing.\n\n490\n00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.580\nSo I'm gonna click on File and then Print.\n\n491\n00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.760\nAnd then from this point here\nyou'll end up getting a printer.\n\n492\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.450\nIf it's ready for you to go, you'll see it\nlisted right here under the word ready.\n\n493\n00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:59.550\nIf you see one listed and\n\n494\n00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.882\nit's not ready, well then that means\nyou're not going to be able to print.\n\n495\n00:26:02.882 --> 00:26:07.330\n&gt;&gt; What is that little green check\non top of the printer there?\n\n496\n00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you start seeing\nthings like the green check marks,\n\n497\n00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.550\nthat means it's considered\nthe default printer.\n\n498\n00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.820\nFor your computer system at this point.\n\n499\n00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.930\nSo if you don't choose one,\nit's gonna say I'm gonna print to that guy\n\n500\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.100\nbecause that's what\nthis one is set up for.\n\n501\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.360\nNotice you can change the number of\ncopies, and from that point you can\n\n502\n00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.880\nactually change some of the other settings\nwhich we're not gonna get too much in\n\n503\n00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:33.600\ndepth in but these are all fairly common\nthroughout the entire suite itself.\n\n504\n00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.700\nNow sometimes you don't want to\nprint to paper though, okay?\n\n505\n00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.045\nWell you can even change that.\n\n506\n00:26:38.045 --> 00:26:41.350\nAnd here in Microsoft they have\nwhat they call Save and Send and\n\n507\n00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:46.240\nit allows me to send it using an email if\nme email system is set up for me to do so.\n\n508\n00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.520\nI can publish in a blog post,\nI can save it to the web.\n\n509\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.520\nBut this is kinda the big one right here,\n\n510\n00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.510\nwhich is to create a PDF\nis what we have available.\n\n511\n00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.920\nAnd normally that's a very standardized\ntype of format that we can use.\n\n512\n00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.890\nIt allows us to be able to distribute it\nvery nicely without somebody being able to\n\n513\n00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.020\nmodify it very easily as well.\n\n514\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.230\nSo just kind of realize that there\nare several options like that.\n\n515\n00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.410\n&gt;&gt; That's a really big one, Ronnie.\n\n516\n00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:12.960\nThank you for showing us that\nbecause I remember in earlier times,\n\n517\n00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.915\nMicrosoft wasn't as evolved as it is now.\n\n518\n00:27:15.915 --> 00:27:19.870\nAnd if I were go ahead and send you a\ndocument and I had one particular version,\n\n519\n00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.580\nlike Microsoft 2010 and\nyou had 2016, it wasn't compatible.\n\n520\n00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:28.460\nSo the PDF, the portable document file\nwas really the best way to go ahead and\n\n521\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.300\nsend a file as an attachment.\n\n522\n00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.540\nBut Microsoft has grown and\n\n523\n00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.220\nthey realize that not everyone\nhas Microsoft products installed.\n\n524\n00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.480\nSo now, if I were to even send you\na Microsoft document as an attachment\n\n525\n00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.050\nI could actually open that file and\nstill view it\n\n526\n00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.310\nif I have an internet connection with\na web browser, so that's pretty cool.\n\n527\n00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.540\nWe can see how things\nare changing in today's times.\n\n528\n00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.370\n&gt;&gt; And there's only one other\noption I want to show you at\n\n529\n00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.950\nthis point which you're gonna\nsee between all those programs.\n\n530\n00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.600\nSo usually everything that I've shown\nyou here is not gonna be anything\n\n531\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.640\nspecifically towards Word,\nit's pretty much generic towards\n\n532\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.860\nall the actual office products that\nare out there is here under options.\n\n533\n00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.210\nIf you need to change the entirety\nof the program itself and\n\n534\n00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.940\nthe background this is\nwhere you end up going.\n\n535\n00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.850\nNow most of us are not gonna\nbe doing a lot of this but\n\n536\n00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:20.794\nit's right here where you can change the\nway that the screen actually looks and you\n\n537\n00:28:20.794 --> 00:28:25.790\ncan actually see some of the displays that\nyou can see, proofing options and you'll\n\n538\n00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:30.376\nsee that there is a ton of them that are\navailable to you to be able to find out.\n\n539\n00:28:30.376 --> 00:28:33.930\nSo you kinda realize that there\nare plenty of these different options and\n\n540\n00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.060\nwhether we're in Word or, PowerPoint or\nwhatever, they'll be the same thing.\n\n541\n00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.370\nAnd one of those things, Cherokee,\nthat we can also point out is here is\n\n542\n00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:47.570\nthe ability for us to change the default\nsaving location that we need to where now,\n\n543\n00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:52.118\nwhat I can do instead is right here\nwhere it says default file location,\n\n544\n00:28:52.118 --> 00:28:56.830\nit may be where I find out it's not stored\non my computer at all but in workplace.\n\n545\n00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:00.070\nIt might actually be stored on\nanother device which is connected.\n\n546\n00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.160\nAnd I might not have\nset this up at all but\n\n547\n00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.870\nif they tell me I need to set this up,\nwell, I might actually come here, and then\n\n548\n00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.440\nthey tell me exactly what I need to type\nin there, and we are off and ready to go.\n\n549\n00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.208\nSo, there are lot of other additional\nfeatures that we will taking a look at.\n\n550\n00:29:14.208 --> 00:29:18.183\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, with all these settings it looks\nlike you can really become quite an expert\n\n551\n00:29:18.183 --> 00:29:19.415\nat something like this.\n\n552\n00:29:19.415 --> 00:29:21.164\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does, and\n\n553\n00:29:21.164 --> 00:29:23.320\njust to show you very,\nquickly and briefly,\n\n554\n00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.854\nI just wanna open up just a couple of\nother programs to show you it's same.\n\n555\n00:29:26.854 --> 00:29:28.686\nSo lets say I spent some time in Word and\n\n556\n00:29:28.686 --> 00:29:31.102\nnow they are saying Ronnie\nyou need work in Excel.\n\n557\n00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:36.012\nOkay, well the good thing is I can take\nthose skills that I've learned about now,\n\n558\n00:29:36.012 --> 00:29:40.510\nI can go to all programs, and Microsoft\nOffice, and now I launch up Excel.\n\n559\n00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.758\nLook at that,\nthe top looks strangely familiar\n\n560\n00:29:42.758 --> 00:29:44.300\n&gt;&gt; Quite similar, yeah.\n\n561\n00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can actually see where,\nit's insert,\n\n562\n00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.720\npage layout,\njust like we were talking about before.\n\n563\n00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.470\nNow, there are some options that are\nspecific to Excel, don't get me wrong, but\n\n564\n00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.410\nat the same time it still works the same.\n\n565\n00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.260\nI have the close buttons, I even have,\nlook at that, File, and look at that,\n\n566\n00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.740\nit takes up the entire\nscreen at the same time.\n\n567\n00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.090\nWe have Print, Save.\n\n568\n00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.220\n&gt;&gt; The Save and\nSave As like you showed us.\n\n569\n00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthen I can go down to Options and\n\n570\n00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.790\nlook at that, it pretty much\nlooks almost the exact same.\n\n571\n00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.068\nThere are some differences but\nthe majority of it, so\n\n572\n00:30:14.068 --> 00:30:15.550\nhere look at the proofing.\n\n573\n00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.460\nNot as big as what we saw\ninside the word processor.\n\n574\n00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.680\nSo you can see that too.\n\n575\n00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.530\nAnd let me just show you that\nif you're going to PowerPoint.\n\n576\n00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:24.522\nLook at that,\n\n577\n00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:30.700\nit's actually the same as well where\nyou're still seeing those same options.\n\n578\n00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.480\nLook.\n\n579\n00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.860\nSo now, learning about one program,\n\n580\n00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:38.520\nwhich we really spent the majority of it\ninside of Microsoft Word in navigation and\n\n581\n00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.780\nunderstanding, notice that we've been\nable to go to three different programs.\n\n582\n00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.950\nAnd just those features itself should make\nyou feel more comfortable in learning\n\n583\n00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:49.080\nabout them, and now you're only learning\nabout differences instead of having to\n\n584\n00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.210\nlearn the entire program over again.\n\n585\n00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:55.520\nAnd that's a powerful feature in terms of\noffice productivity suites that really do\n\n586\n00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.350\nhelp to make you much more efficient,\nand better at what we're gonna be doing\n\n587\n00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.960\nas we learn how to work with\ncomputers on a daily basis.\n\n588\n00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.050\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you're making me wanna go\nonline and start looking for more tips and\n\n589\n00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.710\ntricks because I know\nthat I could use them.\n\n590\n00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.380\nAlways learning, and learning new things.\n\n591\n00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.460\nWe see so many different options\nin these particular applications.\n\n592\n00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.860\nThank you for taking the time to go ahead\nand show us, and I appreciate you guys for\n\n593\n00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:20.660\ntaking the time to learn, to become more\nproductive at your actual employment.\n\n594\n00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.501\nSo I think that about wraps it up for\nthis particular episode.\n\n595\n00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:26.590\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n596\n00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.600\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n597\n00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.829\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n598\n00:31:31.102 --> 00:31:36.950\n[MUSIC]\n\n599\n00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:40.099\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show as we\n\n11\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.758\ncontinue on to take a look at the idea\nof working with applications.\n\n12\n00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:38.918\nWe're specifically gonna be diving in, of\ncourse, to the world of word processing.\n\n13\n00:00:38.918 --> 00:00:40.450\nSo we wanna make sure that\nyou know how to launch it,\n\n14\n00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.850\nas well as some of the things that you can\ndo to help you to become more productive.\n\n15\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.190\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nmy screen, and we'll get started here.\n\n16\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.400\nSo on my computer I do have\nOffice 2010 installed,\n\n17\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.080\nwhich also means I have access\nto the Word application itself.\n\n18\n00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.641\nAnd I simply click on the Start button\nin the lower left-hand corner, and\n\n19\n00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.860\ni can go to all programs.\n\n20\n00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.300\nAnd i'm looking for the folder right\nhere that says Microsoft Office.\n\n21\n00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.520\nSo once i select inside of there,\nI now go and look for\n\n22\n00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.590\nMicrosoft Word 2010 and\nsimply click on it.\n\n23\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.680\nAnd that will launch the program.\n\n24\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.989\nNow, normally it launches\nin one of two ways,\n\n25\n00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:19.897\nat the very beginning when you first have\nthis, it may not be where it opens up to\n\n26\n00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:23.830\nthis nice little piece of paper that\nlooks like you're about to start typing.\n\n27\n00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.890\nA lot of times when you click on File and\nat this particular point I select New.\n\n28\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.782\nThis is another feature that you\nmight see at the very beginning.\n\n29\n00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:36.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So don't get surprised or\n\n30\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.250\ntoo alarmed at this.\n\n31\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.040\n&gt;&gt; So many options.\n\n32\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's a ton of options available for us,\n\n33\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.870\nbut, right here it actually\nshows you something, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.590\nIt says, Ronnie,\nI understand something, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.210\nYou may not know exactly what you're\ndoing, so let me suggest an offering for\n\n36\n00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.920\nyou that is a template.\n\n37\n00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.060\nA template already has gone ahead and\nset up the form and the style,\n\n38\n00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.120\nand what it means is that you\ncan simply just highlight it and\n\n39\n00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.990\nstart typing in its place, and replace\nsome of the information that you have\n\n40\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.990\navailable there to suit your need instead.\n\n41\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.880\nAnd you can see where they have multiple\ndifferent folders here and different\n\n42\n00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.200\ncategories, so this one right here, for\nexample, is a card that you wanna make.\n\n43\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.200\nOr maybe you're actually trying to\nwrite something like a book, or\n\n44\n00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.890\nsome type of business letter or education.\n\n45\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.330\nYou name it, there's a lot of different\nones that are actually available to you.\n\n46\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.580\nThe other one up here at the very top\nwhere it says available templates,\n\n47\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.840\nif I've already been using\none in the recent past,\n\n48\n00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.590\nI'll have a list of the ones\nthat I've actually used here.\n\n49\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.060\nBut if I don't, I can use that\nback arrow to bring me back here.\n\n50\n00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.724\nAnd then I can select something\nlike the let's say example for\n\n51\n00:02:42.724 --> 00:02:45.755\na book,\nit will reach out to Microsoft itself, and\n\n52\n00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:50.056\nthen it will start pulling in some\ndifferent things that can help me when I\n\n53\n00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:54.321\nstart to take a look at the idea of\nwriting some type of book apparently.\n\n54\n00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:57.410\nSo here, for example,\nis a wedding guest book.\n\n55\n00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.690\nAnd so I can download that if\nI want to and get started.\n\n56\n00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.185\nAnd once I do that, notice it\nautomatically opens up Word for me.\n\n57\n00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:09.000\nAnd then, and, of course,\nI would do this very often,\n\n58\n00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.735\nCherokee, especially the idea\nof a wedding book for somebody.\n\n59\n00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:13.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But at this point here-\n\n60\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.820\n&gt;&gt; You have options.\n\n61\n00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.965\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can actually go ahead and\ntype this in.\n\n62\n00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:19.550\nBut notice it's fairly simple,\nguest of, and\n\n63\n00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.570\nwho's a fairly famous person that we\ncan actually say is gonna get married?\n\n64\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.970\n&gt;&gt; Oprah.\n&gt;&gt; Oprah, Oprah.\n\n65\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.970\nI hope I can spell Oprah.\n\n66\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.040\nFor the event that we have, and\nmy keyboard kinda locked up there for\n\n67\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.100\na moment, but I can change that, okay.\n\n68\n00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.970\nSo once I have something like this,\n\n69\n00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.640\nI can just remove the elements that I\ndon't like and simply start typing it in.\n\n70\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.986\nAnd now I am off and I am ready to go,\nand it'll actually go ahead and\n\n71\n00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:45.786\nallow me to start to use it.\n\n72\n00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:46.740\n&gt;&gt; Easy peasy.\n&gt;&gt; And print it out.\n\n73\n00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.910\nSo it fairly is an easy process,\neven if I don't know how to get started.\n\n74\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.380\n&gt;&gt; Without even any kind of\ndesign knowledge or background,\n\n75\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.570\nyou don't have to implement\nany kind of Photoshop here.\n\n76\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.360\nIt's just a boiler plate template\nthat they provide for you.\n\n77\n00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that makes it a lot easier,\nespecially if you're not exactly sure and\n\n78\n00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.850\nthis is kind of your beginning\nof working with Office,\n\n79\n00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.810\nusing a template is\npretty much key as well.\n\n80\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.490\nNow, notice that this is\na blank piece of paper,\n\n81\n00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.910\nat least that's what they're\ntrying to simulate, right.\n\n82\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.090\nYou're saying that's not a template,\nbut it is.\n\n83\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.140\nIt's a template in the very fact\nthat it has a specific size, and\n\n84\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.450\nalso by default it's actually going\nto default to a certain font size,\n\n85\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.310\nas well as to a certain font.\n\n86\n00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.750\nAnd all that is already controlled.\n\n87\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.360\nNow, you can pick out everything that you\nwant to, and change what we don't want.\n\n88\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.220\nBut when it comes down to it, the blank\npaper is really where it does begin if\n\n89\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.240\nyou're having to type from scratch.\n\n90\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.150\nSo remember that when we saw in File, and\n\n91\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.115\ninside of New, a blank document\nis considered a template as well.\n\n92\n00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:50.200\nSo all these are possibilities.\n\n93\n00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.796\nAnd so if do you happen to get onto\na machine where sombody else has used it,\n\n94\n00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:56.001\nmore than likely this\nis kind of the default.\n\n95\n00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:59.247\nIt's gonna say, you've already selected\nthis, let's just go ahead and open that\n\n96\n00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:02.720\none up cuz that's what we're assuming\nyou're gonna want to do anyways, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.230\nSo we're gonna use this as our starting\npoint to show you some of the things you\n\n98\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.700\nneed to be able to do if you gonna\nstart working inside of Word.\n\n99\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.500\nSo the first thing that we want to do,\nof course, is just make sure that you\n\n100\n00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.810\nunderstand that after taking a look at the\nnavigation features in a previous episode,\n\n101\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.590\nwe're not gonna go over all\nthe navigation, but we now wanna work\n\n102\n00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.710\nspecifically inside of Word and\nshow you some of the elements here, okay.\n\n103\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.670\nSo once you have something up, more than\nlikely you're gonna start typing in stuff.\n\n104\n00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.355\nSo I'm just gonna type in Cherokee,\noops, if I can spell her name.\n\n105\n00:05:32.355 --> 00:05:33.008\n&gt;&gt; Cherookee.\n\n106\n00:05:33.008 --> 00:05:33.855\n&gt;&gt; Cherookee.\n\n107\n00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:35.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Boose, and\n\n108\n00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.820\nthen I'm gonna actually type in my name so\nthat we can contrast some other things.\n\n109\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.570\nSo let's say we have a list of names and\nCherokee comes along and\n\n110\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.040\nsays Ronnie you printed out this\nlist of names but they're too small.\n\n111\n00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.350\nWell, what can I do?\n\n112\n00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.370\nWell, I can simply go in here and\nI can highlight a name.\n\n113\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.870\nAnd then I have two options.\n\n114\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.060\nI can go up here to the top inside of\nthat ribbon where I have this, and\n\n115\n00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.720\nthen I can actually change\nthe font that I want to use.\n\n116\n00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.660\nAnd let's say that we change Cherokee's\nto something spectacular here, if we can.\n\n117\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.376\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay.\n&gt;&gt; And there's a lot of different ones.\n\n118\n00:06:08.376 --> 00:06:09.742\nI found the one that I wanna use for\nCherokee.\n\n119\n00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:13.476\n&gt;&gt; So also, something you can if you\nget a little more comfortable and\n\n120\n00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:18.147\nadvanced with your skills here, you can\neven download free fonts from the Internet\n\n121\n00:06:18.147 --> 00:06:21.210\njust by putting those\nfonts in your font folder.\n\n122\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.050\nBut be careful about where you go out\non the Internet to download those.\n\n123\n00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.710\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n124\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.070\nYou wanna make sure you download them from\na trusted site if you're gonna do this,\n\n125\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.760\nbut there's a lot of them inside of\nWord that will help you out too.\n\n126\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.054\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So now notice that we can contrast\n\n127\n00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:37.738\nit just by simply changing the font,\nas well as the size, and\n\n128\n00:06:37.738 --> 00:06:42.361\neven though I went up to the bar, to\nthe ribbon to do that, notice that you can\n\n129\n00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:46.152\nfairly see it looks like a ghost\nCherokee as I hover over this.\n\n130\n00:06:46.152 --> 00:06:47.822\nCan you see that little, kind of, outline?\n\n131\n00:06:47.822 --> 00:06:48.886\nLook at that.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, look at that.\n\n132\n00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:52.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look, see it's almost faded,\nit's faded completely away.\n\n133\n00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.220\nNow it's actually there.\n\n134\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.600\nWell, they actually have this floating\nribbon that if, all of a sudden,\n\n135\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.530\nI realize that that's gonna be too much.\n\n136\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.550\nLet's change it back to Cambria and\nlet's make this 26 point instead.\n\n137\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.900\nNotice it gives me that ability to do so\njust by highlighting it, right-clicking,\n\n138\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.850\nand being able to change the font and\nthe font size.\n\n139\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.190\n&gt;&gt; I also notice that I have a red\nsquiggly line under my last name.\n\n140\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.090\nWhy is that Ronnie?\n\n141\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nWord is actually very nice that it says,\n\n142\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.600\nhey look, I'm noticing a spelling\nhere that I'm not familiar with.\n\n143\n00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.970\nSo even though it has a lot of\ndifferent ways to spell things,\n\n144\n00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.442\nCherokee's last name at\nthis point may not, look.\n\n145\n00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:29.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look at the replacement it's offering.\n\n146\n00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.804\n&gt;&gt; Not so common, yeah.\n\n147\n00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:35.140\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, her spelling is not so common,\nbut the other spelling more common, no.\n\n148\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.808\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so it says is that what you wanna\n\n149\n00:07:36.808 --> 00:07:37.860\ngo ahead and put there?\n\n150\n00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.840\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n151\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.790\nSo you can actually replace\nit with any of these.\n\n152\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.716\nSo if I actually said,\nBoos instead like this, well,\n\n153\n00:07:44.716 --> 00:07:48.893\nhe might go that's not the way\nthat I spell my last name Ronnie.\n\n154\n00:07:48.893 --> 00:07:54.112\nWell, the cool thing is by learning\nsome of shortcuts that we took a look at\n\n155\n00:07:54.112 --> 00:08:00.276\nin the navigation features from an earlier\nepisode, I can simply do a Ctrl+Z, oops.\n\n156\n00:08:00.276 --> 00:08:01.970\nI say that, Ctrl+Z.\n\n157\n00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:07.460\nAnd notice that that undos, or\nit actually undoes, what I just changed.\n\n158\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.882\nSo it really is helpful when you start off\nwith documentation cuz you don't really\n\n159\n00:08:11.882 --> 00:08:14.040\nhave to be a masterful speller.\n\n160\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.390\nA lot of times if you're not,\nlike I'm not, okay,\n\n161\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.070\nit's gonna underline it for you.\n\n162\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.150\nAnd you can either stop and fix it right\nthen, or later on we can actually take it\n\n163\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.730\nthrough an entire spell check for\nthe entire document.\n\n164\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.848\nSo it really does help us to understand\nas we start seeing this, okay.\n\n165\n00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.905\nNow the other thing that you also have to\nknow that kind of plays tricks on you,\n\n166\n00:08:31.905 --> 00:08:34.830\nokay, is that you actually\nend up seeing that\n\n167\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.360\nwe have to work in what we call lines or\ndocuments too, okay.\n\n168\n00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.420\nSo that's what we also need\nto take a look at as well.\n\n169\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:47.730\nNow it doesn't look like what we would\nnormally think of as being a paragraph,\n\n170\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.680\nbut believe it or not, each line that\nyou see here is actually symbolized, and\n\n171\n00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.890\nactually kind of subdivided,\ninto paragraphs.\n\n172\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.889\nAnd the way that you and I can see that\nis by going up here onto the ribbon on\n\n173\n00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:03.224\nthe Home tab, and inside of this paragraph\ngrouping that you see right here,\n\n174\n00:09:03.224 --> 00:09:06.355\nlet me zoom in on that so\nwe can see it a little bit better,\n\n175\n00:09:06.355 --> 00:09:09.381\nthere is a little button that\nlooks like a backward p.\n\n176\n00:09:09.381 --> 00:09:11.860\nAnd it's called the Show/Hide button.\n\n177\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.110\nIf I select that, now you can actually\nsee it adds in additional marks.\n\n178\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.860\nNow the great thing is these\nadditional marks don't really\n\n179\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.570\nend up printing out for you.\n\n180\n00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.970\nThey look a little bit\nstrange as you're working.\n\n181\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.400\nBut sometimes you might get a document\nin and you're like, why is it,\n\n182\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.280\nwhy does it actually give a separate\nline here but not another one there?\n\n183\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.480\nWell, that is because every single\nline after you press enter,\n\n184\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.330\nit actually creates this paragraph mark.\n\n185\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.220\nWhich means everything is actually\ndone and stored in paragraphs.\n\n186\n00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.400\nSo notice if I press enter\na couple of times, or\n\n187\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.460\na few times here, that's what it's\nactually creating is a paragraph mark.\n\n188\n00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.370\nSo everything that we do essentially adds\nin this idea of a paragraph for us, and\n\n189\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.175\nthen we can break it up\nthe way that we want to.\n\n190\n00:09:54.175 --> 00:09:56.996\nSo let's say that we actually have\na list of things that we need\n\n191\n00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:59.210\nto be familiar with, let me zoom out here.\n\n192\n00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.320\nSometimes my keyboard gets\nstuck when I zoom in here.\n\n193\n00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.025\n&gt;&gt; Grocery list.\n\n194\n00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:07.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna make\na grocery list of some sort here.\n\n195\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.706\nSo if I can spell groceries it would help.\n\n196\n00:10:10.706 --> 00:10:15.121\nGrocery list, okay.\n\n197\n00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:19.482\nSo Cherokee is about to start\non some health food thing.\n\n198\n00:10:19.482 --> 00:10:20.700\n&gt;&gt; I said ice cream.\n\n199\n00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.690\n&gt;&gt; So ice cream is part\nof that health food idea.\n\n200\n00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.220\n&gt;&gt; Sure it is.\n\n201\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.520\n&gt;&gt; So ice cream,\nwhat else do we want to add in here?\n\n202\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Cake. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Cake,\nthat's quite the health food diet here.\n\n203\n00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.170\n&gt;&gt; This is pretend so\nwe can have whatever we want.\n\n204\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:34.760\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n205\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.290\nI'm gonna assume root beer then.\n\n206\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, to go with our ice cream.\n\n207\n00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.218\n&gt;&gt; To go with ice cream for\nsome type of float here.\n\n208\n00:10:41.218 --> 00:10:41.750\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n209\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n210\n00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Chips, potato chips.\n\n211\n00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Chips.\n\n212\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.185\nAnd sprinkles of some sort.\n\n213\n00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:48.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's do sprinkles, okay.\n\n214\n00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.510\nNow, that list that we see,\n\n215\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.370\nI can take my name out here because I'm\nnot gonna be a part of that list there.\n\n216\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but what we can do is we can\n\n217\n00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.530\nchange this to make it stand out.\n\n218\n00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.770\nSo I'm selecting all those\ndifferent items in that list.\n\n219\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:08.720\nWell, if I, once again, hover over it,\nI can right-click, oops, I'm trying to.\n\n220\n00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.000\nAnd I have some different options here,\nbut I can hover over, that says bullet,\n\n221\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.760\nand now notice I can create\na bulleted list as well.\n\n222\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.790\nSo I'm gonna remove that so\nthat you can see it, and\n\n223\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.180\nthat makes it stand out\njust a little bit more.\n\n224\n00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.210\nAnd let's change that font size.\n\n225\n00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.436\nSo now we can add in just\na little bit Cherokee Boose's-\n\n226\n00:11:31.436 --> 00:11:32.888\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n227\n00:11:32.888 --> 00:11:34.506\n&gt;&gt; Health food.\n\n228\n00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:36.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; List.\n\n229\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.160\nThere we go.\n\n230\n00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.138\nOkay, so her grocery items for\nher health food is gonna be right here for\n\n231\n00:11:41.138 --> 00:11:42.146\nher new fad diet.\n\n232\n00:11:42.146 --> 00:11:43.133\n&gt;&gt; And you know what,\n\n233\n00:11:43.133 --> 00:11:46.466\nsomething that my son showed me\nthat instead of you previously,\n\n234\n00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:50.930\nyou had showed us how to manually increase\nthe font for that first header there.\n\n235\n00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.840\nIf you were to just highlight all that,\nin that ribbon\n\n236\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.490\nacross the top it says Header 1,\nHeader 2, those are really cool features.\n\n237\n00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.960\nI'll tell you what,\nthey didn't have that originally with\n\n238\n00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.585\nthe previous editions of Microsoft Word,\nso we're progressing.\n\n239\n00:12:03.585 --> 00:12:04.621\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n240\n00:12:04.621 --> 00:12:06.502\nit's all about the idea of efficiency,\nright.\n\n241\n00:12:06.502 --> 00:12:07.480\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n242\n00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.200\n&gt;&gt; What you see right there that\nCherokee is talking about is the idea of\n\n243\n00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.740\nstyles here.\n\n244\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.870\nIf I didn't want to format it, but\nI wanted to actually increase it and\n\n245\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.430\nmake it look a little bit differently,\nI could select the entire paragraph by\n\n246\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.370\nsimply clicking in\nthe left margin over here.\n\n247\n00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.820\nAnd notice that that selects\nthat entire paragraph.\n\n248\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.596\nThen I can change this to a title,\nand notice it adds in a line and\n\n249\n00:12:27.596 --> 00:12:29.175\nchanges the font itself.\n\n250\n00:12:29.175 --> 00:12:30.620\n&gt;&gt; Fancy, yeah.\n\n251\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.662\n&gt;&gt; Without me having to\ndo all of that stuff.\n\n252\n00:12:32.662 --> 00:12:34.800\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\nOr I can actually add in another one.\n\n253\n00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.410\nHere under heading,\nlet's make that Heading 2.\n\n254\n00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:38.324\nThat looks a little bit smaller.\n\n255\n00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:39.030\nAnd let's make that heading there.\n\n256\n00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.175\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nit looks like it has a color theme to it.\n\n257\n00:12:41.175 --> 00:12:44.823\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can actually change it\nand it actually does a live-change for\n\n258\n00:12:44.823 --> 00:12:46.100\nyou as well.\n\n259\n00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.530\nSo those are different ways that you\ncan format stuff fairly quickly if\n\n260\n00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.710\nyou needed to.\n\n261\n00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.755\nNow that, of course,\nI don't like any of that, so.\n\n262\n00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:55.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I wanna actually do it like\n\n263\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.530\nthis instead.\n\n264\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:00.590\nSo by doing something like this,\nnotice that you can change a lot of\n\n265\n00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.520\nitems fairly quickly and\nmake it look the way that you want to.\n\n266\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.370\nSo I'm gonna right-click and\ngo to Bullets.\n\n267\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.670\nLet's say I like another option instead,\nlike check marks here.\n\n268\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.608\nNotice that we can change that\nvery easily and very quickly.\n\n269\n00:13:14.608 --> 00:13:19.230\nSo making a list is kinda one of those\nthings that we may actually end up doing\n\n270\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.700\nwith something like Word\nvery quickly as well, okay.\n\n271\n00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.810\nNow, of course,\n\n272\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:30.120\nthat also means then that we have to\nbe able to control a few other things.\n\n273\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.470\nNow, this is where the idea of\nturning on those spaces, or\n\n274\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.280\nmarks like this, helps, right.\n\n275\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.379\nSo if you kinda saw me, a little bit\nearlier, trying to get rid of something,\n\n276\n00:13:39.379 --> 00:13:42.338\nit's like, here, I've got this\nbullet point, right, and I'm like,\n\n277\n00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:45.419\nwhy is that not going away, and that's\ncuz I keep hitting the wrong button.\n\n278\n00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:50.295\nAnd then I had to actually had to delete\nthat bullet point, and now I can actually,\n\n279\n00:13:50.295 --> 00:13:53.422\nkind of, get on with typing\nin the way that I need to.\n\n280\n00:13:53.422 --> 00:13:55.844\nSo that will reveal all\nthe underlying marks, and\n\n281\n00:13:55.844 --> 00:13:59.810\ndifferent things that Word is\nactually creating for us, okay.\n\n282\n00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.930\nOf course, you can also use\nthis like a typewriter, and\n\n283\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.240\nyou can setup things like indenting\nby hitting your tab, as well.\n\n284\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.460\n&gt;&gt; What's a typewriter?\n\n285\n00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:08.998\n&gt;&gt; What's a typewriter?\n\n286\n00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:10.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A typewriter is how\n\n287\n00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.805\nwe manually used to do\nword-processing on actual paper.\n\n288\n00:14:13.805 --> 00:14:16.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, kinda strange.\n\n289\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.500\nBut I actually started typing by\nusing a manual typewriter, and\n\n290\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.870\nhaving a platen and actually turning\npaper down and doing stuff like that.\n\n291\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:30.490\nBut yes, I know that as the years have\ngone by the idea of a typewriter has now\n\n292\n00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:35.500\ndissipated into history, but the very fact\nis it's still doing the same functions,\n\n293\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.100\nbut now without having to do it manually.\n\n294\n00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.030\n&gt;&gt; Digital, yep.\n\n295\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.980\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it's all completely digital.\n\n296\n00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.600\nBut we can actually set this\nup in the idea of a tab stop.\n\n297\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.420\nNow what I'm missing\nacross the top here is\n\n298\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.740\nwhere are those tab stops\nactually going to be placed.\n\n299\n00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.570\nWell if I go to, let me make sure\nI'm saying this right, View.\n\n300\n00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:01.750\nAnd now in View,\nnotice that there is under the ribbon here\n\n301\n00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.400\nView in the tab and\nthen there's a group here called show.\n\n302\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.560\nI can select Ruler.\n\n303\n00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.800\nAnd what we can end up seeing here is,\nthat across the top and\n\n304\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.760\nnow on left-hand side, you see these,\nlet me make sure we can see that.\n\n305\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.720\nAlmost you can see that as being a ruler.\n\n306\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.440\nSo now that I've actually hit the tab,\nif I hit it again, you can watch these\n\n307\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.240\nmarks up here at the top,\nright there, actually kind of move.\n\n308\n00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:36.305\nSo notice that it's actually moving, and\nthat is what a tab stop looks like or\n\n309\n00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:40.492\na tab, yeah,\nactually looks like inside of Word today.\n\n310\n00:15:40.492 --> 00:15:42.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou can actually click on that and\n\n311\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.109\nmove it back over from that ruler up top\nif you accidentally mess it up somehow and\n\n312\n00:15:46.109 --> 00:15:47.741\nyou're like hey, what happened?\n\n313\n00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:50.977\nWell, your cursor could have\nactually hit it and moved it, so\n\n314\n00:15:50.977 --> 00:15:54.791\n[LAUGH] you won't have a headache about\nthat, just slide it back on over.\n\n315\n00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:58.612\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's generally set in the same\nway that it used to be on typewriters,\n\n316\n00:15:58.612 --> 00:16:00.359\nwhich is a half inch is what we see.\n\n317\n00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:03.644\nSo I can also delete or\nuse my backspace and when I do that,\n\n318\n00:16:03.644 --> 00:16:06.666\nit actually moves it back\nto the original tab stops.\n\n319\n00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:11.387\nYou can control these tabs in\nhowever you want to by being able\n\n320\n00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:14.470\nto just do a few different things.\n\n321\n00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.820\nSo just kind of realize you can\nset them where you need to, but\n\n322\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.287\nit allows you then to kind of offset or do\nindentions or actually make sure that you\n\n323\n00:16:22.287 --> 00:16:26.581\ncan tab over and make even columns if you\nwant to by using the tabs stop as well.\n\n324\n00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:30.904\n&gt;&gt; yeah, and those little grey areas that\nwe see out on the side, those margins,\n\n325\n00:16:30.904 --> 00:16:35.162\nthey're simply just to kind give you a\nlittle bit of extra space in case just to\n\n326\n00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:38.728\nprevent any text from breeding\noff the edge of that paper there.\n\n327\n00:16:38.728 --> 00:16:39.434\n&gt;&gt; yeah.\n\n328\n00:16:39.434 --> 00:16:43.295\nit's to try and emulate the fact\nthat you're gonna be trying to see.\n\n329\n00:16:43.295 --> 00:16:48.020\nYou’re essentially having a print preview\nof the way that it should turn out on your\n\n330\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.596\npaper when you start\nlooking at this as well.\n\n331\n00:16:50.596 --> 00:16:54.985\nNow Cherokee, if you notice something\nabout the way that we've created this list\n\n332\n00:16:54.985 --> 00:16:59.054\nhere, there's a couple other things we\nalso have to pay attention to as well\n\n333\n00:16:59.054 --> 00:17:03.930\nwhich is, notice that there's, looks like\nthere's some spacing in between right?\n\n334\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.673\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And even though it actually looks okay,\n\n335\n00:17:06.673 --> 00:17:10.540\nit looks good,\nwhat if we don't want anything like that?\n\n336\n00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.477\nWhat if we said look, it's not\nsupposed to be spaced out that way.\n\n337\n00:17:13.477 --> 00:17:18.372\nWe need to change those concepts and that\nidea to where I don't want those spaces.\n\n338\n00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:22.328\nLet me get rid of that show hide just for\na moment, and so it looks natural because\n\n339\n00:17:22.328 --> 00:17:25.890\nyou've been looking at it for\na few minutes now, but it really isn't.\n\n340\n00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.868\nThere is actually what we call of course\nfollowing line space in between each\n\n341\n00:17:30.868 --> 00:17:33.370\nof these lines that we see right here.\n\n342\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.389\nI've just about move something\nwhich i didn't mean to.\n\n343\n00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:36.804\nLet me do a Ctrl z.\n\n344\n00:17:36.804 --> 00:17:37.757\n&gt;&gt; That's what i told you.\n\n345\n00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:38.709\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n346\n00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:39.867\n&gt;&gt; It's easy sometimes\nto actually remove it.\n\n347\n00:17:39.867 --> 00:17:40.574\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n348\n00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:41.683\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n349\n00:17:41.683 --> 00:17:42.784\nyou can do stuff like that as well,\nall right.\n\n350\n00:17:42.784 --> 00:17:44.196\nSo, now what do i have to do?\n\n351\n00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:47.803\nWell because it actually works\nbased off of paragraphs instead,\n\n352\n00:17:47.803 --> 00:17:52.730\nI'm gonna turn that back on and you can\nsee that there is a little bit of spacing.\n\n353\n00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.863\nSo I can actually affect\nit in several ways.\n\n354\n00:17:54.863 --> 00:17:58.067\nIf I wanna affect the spacing\nafter a paragraph,\n\n355\n00:17:58.067 --> 00:18:01.661\nI simply click in one of those\nlines as a paragraph, and\n\n356\n00:18:01.661 --> 00:18:06.760\nthen I can come up here into the paragraph\ngrouping and there is a little icon.\n\n357\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:12.566\nIf I hover over it's say line spacing and\nparagraph spacing as well.\n\n358\n00:18:12.566 --> 00:18:17.086\nOkay, so now if click here,\nI can see in-between the lines this is\n\n359\n00:18:17.086 --> 00:18:20.980\nactually set at 1.15 as\nfar as parallel line.\n\n360\n00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.004\nSo it's not just gonna skip, it's not\njust gonna go to the very next line,\n\n361\n00:18:24.004 --> 00:18:25.789\nit's actually parallel line here, okay.\n\n362\n00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:28.449\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, in this sense if I were typing in\n\n363\n00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:31.914\nmultiple lines into a paragraph,\nI can change the spacing.\n\n364\n00:18:31.914 --> 00:18:34.761\n&gt;&gt; You mean if my teacher\nsaid write a five page essay,\n\n365\n00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:37.954\nthey don't mean go ahead and\nincrease the spacing here.\n\n366\n00:18:37.954 --> 00:18:42.244\n&gt;&gt; But people have gotten away with it by\nactually being able to do something like\n\n367\n00:18:42.244 --> 00:18:43.630\nthat as well.\n\n368\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.375\n&gt;&gt; But watch what can happen.\n\n369\n00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:46.948\nSo you didn't see it because it\nwas kinda zoomed it, it still is.\n\n370\n00:18:46.948 --> 00:18:47.982\nLet me zoom back out.\n\n371\n00:18:47.982 --> 00:18:49.639\nAnd watch what happens when I change it.\n\n372\n00:18:49.639 --> 00:18:50.589\nSo I change it to one.\n\n373\n00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:54.820\nYou can see where now that line right\nafter it has actually kinda collapsed in.\n\n374\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.668\nNotice Ice cream and\nCake are actually more together, okay?\n\n375\n00:18:57.668 --> 00:18:59.611\nAnd then,\nif I actually start moving it out,\n\n376\n00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:01.335\nnotice I can actually separate it out.\n\n377\n00:19:01.335 --> 00:19:03.603\n&gt;&gt; Cool-\n&gt;&gt; Without having to go back and\n\n378\n00:19:03.603 --> 00:19:05.201\nretype it all in as well.\n\n379\n00:19:05.201 --> 00:19:09.585\n&gt;&gt; So I could keep my list on one page so\nI wouldn't be like having the sprinkles on\n\n380\n00:19:09.585 --> 00:19:11.945\nthe next page if I had\na really long list and\n\n381\n00:19:11.945 --> 00:19:14.187\nI wanted to just use one sheet of paper.\n\n382\n00:19:14.187 --> 00:19:17.376\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah, that might be something\nthat you have to do if you're-\n\n383\n00:19:17.376 --> 00:19:18.117\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n384\n00:19:18.117 --> 00:19:18.958\n&gt;&gt; Adding in that much too to\n\n385\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:19.605\nhealth food list.\n\n386\n00:19:19.605 --> 00:19:20.227\nI mean, you might as well.\n\n387\n00:19:20.227 --> 00:19:21.423\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n388\n00:19:21.423 --> 00:19:23.856\nSo the other thing, of course,\nis that idea of the paragraph.\n\n389\n00:19:23.856 --> 00:19:27.335\nSo let me go back here to the same thing,\nand you might see this actually written\n\n390\n00:19:27.335 --> 00:19:31.150\nout where it does say something like\nline spacing or paragraph spacing.\n\n391\n00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:36.074\nBut notice that I can actually add or\nremove space too following the paragraph.\n\n392\n00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:37.410\nAnd you can see it actually moving.\n\n393\n00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.099\nSo I can increase the spacing,\nor I can actually remove it.\n\n394\n00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:45.276\nNow, where that works better, of course,\nis not when you just pick a single\n\n395\n00:19:45.276 --> 00:19:49.050\nparagraph, but\nwhen you pick multiple paragraphs.\n\n396\n00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:53.278\nSo now, I can select all those paragraphs,\nand then I can come up here, and\n\n397\n00:19:53.278 --> 00:19:54.904\nnow I can remove the spaces.\n\n398\n00:19:54.904 --> 00:19:58.472\nAnd look how close that actually\ngets everything now instead.\n\n399\n00:19:58.472 --> 00:20:03.682\nSo it allows you to kind of size and\nshape it the way that you need to.\n\n400\n00:20:03.682 --> 00:20:06.620\nNow, you might be wondering like,\nI'm never gonna do anything like this.\n\n401\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.289\nBut remember,\n\n402\n00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:10.670\nthe majority of the time you're not\nworking on a brand new document.\n\n403\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.220\nOkay, so you're working on\na document that somebody,\n\n404\n00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.271\nessentially you're editing\na document is what you're gonna do.\n\n405\n00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:19.621\nSo let me pull up the one that we're\ngoing to use here as an example.\n\n406\n00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:20.829\nSo I'm gonna click on file.\n\n407\n00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:26.800\nAnd then, on this one, I'm going to\nopen up a letter that I just wrote here.\n\n408\n00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.884\nThere we go, a thank you letter.\n\n409\n00:20:28.884 --> 00:20:29.843\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n410\n00:20:29.843 --> 00:20:30.633\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n411\n00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:32.374\nIt's not to you.\n\n412\n00:20:32.374 --> 00:20:33.947\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there we go, okay?\n\n413\n00:20:33.947 --> 00:20:37.966\nNow this particular letter that I wrote,\nand you might go, I can't read it.\n\n414\n00:20:37.966 --> 00:20:40.521\nYou're not supposed to, but\nyou can red it if you want to.\n\n415\n00:20:40.521 --> 00:20:43.001\nBut you'll just to kind of\npause the ideo to do so.\n\n416\n00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:47.701\nBut a member of ours went ahead and\nsent us a nice copy of a book and\n\n417\n00:20:47.701 --> 00:20:51.782\nI read it over the holidays and\nI wanted to thank them for\n\n418\n00:20:51.782 --> 00:20:55.110\nactually sending a copy of that book.\n\n419\n00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.398\nSo I said let me use this for\n\n420\n00:20:56.398 --> 00:20:59.280\nthe show because it does actually\nkinda say what I want to.\n\n421\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.005\nNow, Cherokee, if you were looking at this\nand let's say that this letter went on for\n\n422\n00:21:03.005 --> 00:21:06.477\nfive or six pages like this, it'd be\na lot of text on the page, wouldn't it?\n\n423\n00:21:06.477 --> 00:21:07.854\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it kind of doesn't look\n\n424\n00:21:07.854 --> 00:21:08.421\nspaced out.\n\n425\n00:21:08.421 --> 00:21:10.623\nKinda looks so dense in there.\n\n426\n00:21:10.623 --> 00:21:13.914\nWell, this is where we can actually\nuse something like what we\n\n427\n00:21:13.914 --> 00:21:15.510\nwere talking about earlier.\n\n428\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.421\nSo now,\neven though it's not really very long,\n\n429\n00:21:18.421 --> 00:21:22.980\nlet me now space that out a little bit\nmore, and let's just do this instead.\n\n430\n00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.635\nNow it actually looks what,\na little bit more readable, right,\n\n431\n00:21:26.635 --> 00:21:29.940\njust by adding in that\nlittle bit of line spacing.\n\n432\n00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:34.164\nAnd even separating out that paragraph,\nwhere I might actually say,\n\n433\n00:21:34.164 --> 00:21:38.039\nI want to add in some space after\nthe paragraph, or even before.\n\n434\n00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:42.705\nIt looks like the before here allows me\nto add in just a little bit of space in\n\n435\n00:21:42.705 --> 00:21:43.247\nthere.\n\n436\n00:21:43.247 --> 00:21:44.985\nAnd now, you're saying,\nhow much did it add in?\n\n437\n00:21:44.985 --> 00:21:49.822\nWell, every time you work inside of Word,\nif there's more than actually needs\n\n438\n00:21:49.822 --> 00:21:53.085\nto be revealed,\nlet me see how much I can zoom in here.\n\n439\n00:21:53.085 --> 00:21:55.422\nThere is a little button right here.\n\n440\n00:21:55.422 --> 00:21:59.285\nAnd that is called a dialogue launch,\nor dialogue box launcher.\n\n441\n00:21:59.285 --> 00:22:00.487\nI know, it's a mouthful.\n\n442\n00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:01.505\nYou don't have to know that,\n\n443\n00:22:01.505 --> 00:22:03.960\njust call it the little button in\nthe lower right hand corner of a group.\n\n444\n00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.543\nSo if I select that, it's right here,\nthat I can actually change the spacing.\n\n445\n00:22:10.543 --> 00:22:11.295\n&gt;&gt; The exact specifications.\n\n446\n00:22:11.295 --> 00:22:13.074\n&gt;&gt; Exactly the way that I want to.\n\n447\n00:22:13.074 --> 00:22:17.372\nSo you can actually use those features\nto really help you out to make\n\n448\n00:22:17.372 --> 00:22:20.530\nthe document or whatever to look better.\n\n449\n00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.821\nSo if I handed you that letter or\nif somebody handed me that letter and\n\n450\n00:22:23.821 --> 00:22:26.957\nsaid Ronnie, we're gonna send\nthis letter out to that member.\n\n451\n00:22:26.957 --> 00:22:30.273\nBut it really looks like it's too dense.\n\n452\n00:22:30.273 --> 00:22:33.847\nWell Cherokee, you now have the tools\nto be able to take that letter and\n\n453\n00:22:33.847 --> 00:22:37.784\nnotice now, even though it probably now\neven fills up a better part of a page,\n\n454\n00:22:37.784 --> 00:22:39.180\nit looks a lot better.\n\n455\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.510\n&gt;&gt; You know in high school,\nmy teacher would have us go ahead and\n\n456\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.790\nhave us do double spacing for our drafts,\nso they would have room to go ahead and\n\n457\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:50.100\nwrite in any of those proofs and\nedits to those documents.\n\n458\n00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.291\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's important concept as\nwell when we start to take a look at some\n\n459\n00:22:54.291 --> 00:22:57.998\ndifferent issues that we can have\nwith something like editing stuff.\n\n460\n00:22:57.998 --> 00:22:59.827\nAnd that's probably the majority of it,\nright?\n\n461\n00:22:59.827 --> 00:23:01.999\nMost of the time inside of a company,\n\n462\n00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:05.190\nI'm not gonna be creating\noriginal documentation.\n\n463\n00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.411\nDon't get me wrong.\nThey may actually task you with that.\n\n464\n00:23:07.411 --> 00:23:12.586\nBut usually, it's something that they're\nsaying, all right, I need this to actually\n\n465\n00:23:12.586 --> 00:23:17.710\nlook good, okay, or I need you to proof\nthis and make sure that it looks readable.\n\n466\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.533\nWhatever it might be,\nwell those are some of the basic tools.\n\n467\n00:23:20.533 --> 00:23:24.044\nAnd we do have some more to go,\nbut overall though,\n\n468\n00:23:24.044 --> 00:23:28.303\nwe've actually shown you quite a few so\nfar, as well, okay.\n\n469\n00:23:28.303 --> 00:23:30.209\nSo, notice that some other things.\n\n470\n00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:32.958\nSo let's go back in and\nadd in a couple of things here.\n\n471\n00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:36.374\nSo, remember we talked about\nthe idea of indenting or tab stops.\n\n472\n00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:40.021\nWe're not gonna do tab stops right away,\nbut I can simply indent this tache and\n\n473\n00:23:40.021 --> 00:23:41.857\nmake it look more like a letter, okay?\n\n474\n00:23:41.857 --> 00:23:44.378\nSo I can do that at\nthe beginning of this paragraph.\n\n475\n00:23:44.378 --> 00:23:48.489\nNow, if I turn those paragraph\nmarkings back on, you can now see\n\n476\n00:23:48.489 --> 00:23:53.301\nwhere it took all these lines, even\nthough before I had actually had what?\n\n477\n00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:55.282\nOne paragraph marked per line, right,\n\n478\n00:23:55.282 --> 00:23:58.089\nwhen we were making Cherokee's\nhealth food list there.\n\n479\n00:23:58.089 --> 00:23:59.115\nWe had one paragraph per line.\n\n480\n00:23:59.115 --> 00:24:00.591\nBut notice, Cherokee,\n\n481\n00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:04.645\nthat this whole thing is actually\nin a paragraph unto itself.\n\n482\n00:24:04.645 --> 00:24:08.610\nAlright, so let's just take a look here\nat what I just highlighted, right?\n\n483\n00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:13.600\nSo notice that inside of this, as I zoom\nin, you might even be able to see a little\n\n484\n00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.100\nbit more marks in between and each one\nof those is actually very important,\n\n485\n00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.120\nbecause that symbolizes a space\nwhen you hit the space bar.\n\n486\n00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.070\nSometimes people try and\ncreate lines exactly the same length,\n\n487\n00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.640\nand they don't know how to do that,\nor start exactly the same place, so\n\n488\n00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.130\nwhat ends up happening is then they add\nin a space or two and it throws it off.\n\n489\n00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.910\nWell you can see it like right here,\nif you were to do something like this.\n\n490\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:40.090\nIf I hit the space bar a couple of times,\nyou can see that even, let me see,\n\n491\n00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.180\nmy mouse went ahead and\nkind of jumped out on me.\n\n492\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.790\nSo let me see if I can get that back.\n\n493\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.870\nThere we go.\n\n494\n00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:49.420\nSorry, that zoom really does kind of\nplay around a little bit of havoc.\n\n495\n00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.820\nSo you can see right here where\nit actually added in the few, and\n\n496\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.790\ngo, that's what I need to do.\n\n497\n00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.920\nThose extra spaces is\nexactly what I didn't want.\n\n498\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.030\nSo now I know that if I only have\none space in there, I can see that.\n\n499\n00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.310\nSo these are things where normally once\nsomebody's typing real fast they don't\n\n500\n00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.260\npay attention.\n\n501\n00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.190\nBut if you're going back and\nyou're correcting that and\n\n502\n00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.310\nyou're having to do that-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n503\n00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.980\n&gt;&gt; It helps out a lot.\n\n504\n00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.142\n&gt;&gt; That same teacher, always,\nwhat period, space, space.\n\n505\n00:25:13.142 --> 00:25:14.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was a mark\n\n506\n00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.530\noff if you didn't adhere to that.\n\n507\n00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it makes it easy.\n\n508\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:22.540\nBut today, the weird thing is Microsoft\nWord, it can do it, sometimes it doesn't.\n\n509\n00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.220\nSo even though that's the way\nthat I learned how to type,\n\n510\n00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:32.130\nwith the idea here of having two spaces\nat the very beginning of a line,\n\n511\n00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:37.060\nwell Microsoft Word says that's kind of\nand they don't show that mark anymore.\n\n512\n00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:42.140\nThe way that they show the double space Is\nby actually using this little simple and\n\n513\n00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.110\na space as well.\n\n514\n00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:47.160\nIt used to be where you'd\nactually see the two spaces but\n\n515\n00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.870\ntoday they don't they kind of that.\n\n516\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.000\nAnd the reason why is\napparently that's passe now.\n\n517\n00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.690\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n518\n00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n519\n00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Getting old.\n\n520\n00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:53.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNo.\n\n521\n00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.700\nJust kind of just stick in there.\n\n522\n00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.610\nYou'll catch up with me one day Cherokee.\n\n523\n00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n524\n00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.150\n&gt;&gt; But in this sense right.\n\n525\n00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.060\n&gt;&gt; That is really kind of at least\nsome of the basics that you can\n\n526\n00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.620\ndo with an existing document\nthat you're going to have to\n\n527\n00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:12.540\nreally work with sometimes to massage\nit and add in stuff that you want to.\n\n528\n00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:17.910\nSo with this particular letter, right,\nas you go on through there, and see,\n\n529\n00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:23.690\nI apparently added in an extra, Kind of\nparagraph stuff that I didn't want to.\n\n530\n00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:29.080\nSo I'm going to remove that\nparagraph spacing that I had before.\n\n531\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.940\nAnd now it actually looks more uniform,\nby comparison,\n\n532\n00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.600\nall the way through that entirety of\nthe letter that we have in place.\n\n533\n00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.170\nSo at this particular point,\nyou at least have enough know-how,\n\n534\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.610\nright, to take an existing document and\n\n535\n00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:51.410\nbe able to massage it just a little bit to\nhelp you to change the way that it ends\n\n536\n00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.650\nup looking and to do all the different\nthings that are available.\n\n537\n00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.880\nNow, we still got a lot more to go,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n538\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.030\nshow you just a couple of more options.\n\n539\n00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.900\nThat you need to know about too.\n\n540\n00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:09.420\nSometimes, let's talk about the idea of\npages for a moment and what we can do.\n\n541\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.570\nSo if you have a, and\nthis is the way that I normally see it, so\n\n542\n00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.940\nlet me do some things that I'm not\nsupposed to do to kind of help.\n\n543\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.239\nLet's say that,\nmy letter I was much more verbose.\n\n544\n00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.710\nAnd that what ends up happening and\nChuckey you might have seen this before.\n\n545\n00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.848\nAt the end of these where\nyou print it out and\n\n546\n00:27:25.848 --> 00:27:27.334\nthere is only one line-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n547\n00:27:27.334 --> 00:27:28.166\n&gt;&gt; At the very end.\n\n548\n00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:29.178\n&gt;&gt; Such an annoyance.\n\n549\n00:27:29.178 --> 00:27:30.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n550\n00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.510\n&gt;&gt; And it is, That's very annoying but\n\n551\n00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.750\nlet's say that the page.\n\n552\n00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.640\nSo pretend in other words just\nkind of imagine in your mind\n\n553\n00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.900\nthat this letter did exactly\nsomething like that.\n\n554\n00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.830\nRight, so what if you realize\nthat hay what I need to do\n\n555\n00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:48.800\nis I need to include another paragraph\ninto that, because it's juts too long for\n\n556\n00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.280\none page but\nit's not enough to actually do like a lot.\n\n557\n00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.120\nBut to make it at least it meant\nto flow over, I can go ahead and\n\n558\n00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.440\ncreate what we call a page break Now I\ncan do this by simply starting here and\n\n559\n00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.290\nhitting all these Enters and\nadding them in,\n\n560\n00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:08.390\nbut that's adding in a lot more\nextra things into the document.\n\n561\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.710\nAnd then later on,\n\n562\n00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.970\nif that changes by accident,\nit can throw off the entire paper.\n\n563\n00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:14.960\nThere's 30 pages.\n\n564\n00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.950\nIt can throw it off incredibly\nif you're not careful.\n\n565\n00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.660\nSo instead I can do a control and\n\n566\n00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.870\na return and when I do this,\nyou're going, what did that do?\n\n567\n00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:31.340\nAlmost take a look, notice that it added\nin something called a hard page break.\n\n568\n00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.700\nSo what this is gonna say\nwhen you go out to print it,\n\n569\n00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.500\nis that it's saying I don't care\nwhat you think is gonna happen.\n\n570\n00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.270\nThis is where I'm going to\nbreak the page for printing, so\n\n571\n00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.750\nthat way it flows automatically,\nskips all this space down here, and\n\n572\n00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.430\nthen begins to print\nthis as a second page.\n\n573\n00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.500\nSo it allows us to take a little bit more\n\n574\n00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.300\nwhen you take a look at a longer\ndocument to break it up.\n\n575\n00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.220\nAnd this is more important for\nthe appeal of a document sometimes\n\n576\n00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.520\nRather than the idea of\nthe link that the document.\n\n577\n00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.990\nSo if you know that you're\ngonna be doing stuff like this,\n\n578\n00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:10.320\ninserting in something like a page break,\nis what you really wanna do.\n\n579\n00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.200\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, the page isn't\nthe only thing that needs a break.\n\n580\n00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.140\nUnfortunately, I need one also.\n\n581\n00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:21.030\nIs there anything else you'd like to add\nbefore we continue onto the next show?\n\n582\n00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.890\nWell, now just remember\nthat you need to practice.\n\n583\n00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:28.630\nIf you're just preparing for the industry\nitself, and you're trying to get in there,\n\n584\n00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:33.850\ntry and get a copy of Microsoft Word as\na trial example, and try and work through\n\n585\n00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.900\nand pull up some of those templates and\nwork with them a little bit of the time.\n\n586\n00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.410\nGo through and learn some of the different\ntechniques that you can use that will help\n\n587\n00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.140\nyou to become more productive as you're\nworking with documents, as well.\n\n588\n00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.930\nAnd that will be the biggest help to you.\n\n589\n00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.220\nBut if you're already starting to work,\nand you just need to get more productive.\n\n590\n00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.260\nThe things that we've shown you\nwill at least get you started.\n\n591\n00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.340\nAnd there's a lot more for us to see.\n\n592\n00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.530\nGreat.\nWell, thank you so much for\n\n593\n00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.050\ntaking the time to go ahead and\nshow us all these little tips.\n\n594\n00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.070\nI have a feeling there's\nmore headed our way.\n\n595\n00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.430\nAnd thank you guys for staying tuned.\n\n596\n00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.790\nSo that about wraps it up for\nthis episode here for\n\n597\n00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:08.900\nour IC3 Key Applications Microsoft Word\n2010.\n\n598\n00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.870\nI'm your show host,\nsigning off, Cherokee Boost.\n\n599\n00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:12.760\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:28.120\nshow you guys some tips today,\nother than Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.570\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.170\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.710\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue on to take a look at more.\n\n12\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.930\nIn Microsoft Word and\nmaking sure that we feel familiar and\n\n13\n00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.450\ncomfortable with navigating around,\n\n14\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.610\nas well as with working with the basics of\nthe techniques that we need to know about.\n\n15\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.500\nSo we're pretty much picking up where we\nhad left off in the previous episode,\n\n16\n00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.390\nwhere we had talked about some of\nthe different things that we can do in\n\n17\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.440\nworking with brand new documents\nas well as with templates, and\n\n18\n00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.170\nshowing how you could control\na few different things.\n\n19\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.620\nNow we're gonna pick up right there and\n\n20\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.160\nshow you some of the other things that\nwe also need to know about as well.\n\n21\n00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.320\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n22\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.050\nAnd we'll pick up a little\nbit of a review here.\n\n23\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.096\nThat last thing that we were talking\nabout was this letter that I had\n\n24\n00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:12.434\njust written to someone that\nhad sent us a book to read.\n\n25\n00:01:12.434 --> 00:01:14.310\nAnd it was very kind of them to do so.\n\n26\n00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.340\nAnd I wanted to write a thank you letter.\n\n27\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.080\nBut I was using this at the end of our\nprevious show, to insert in a page break.\n\n28\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.150\nAnd the idea of the page break remember,\nsays that I'm not counting\n\n29\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.810\non the standard page size to say where\nI'm gonna actually have printing done.\n\n30\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.170\nWhat I'm gonna do is manually\ninsert in this break, and that way,\n\n31\n00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.910\nI can control where the printing is done,\nand where a page actually begins.\n\n32\n00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.680\nSo we turn on these different\nmarkings on the Show Hide.\n\n33\n00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.270\nTo show you, here's what a manual\npage break looks like, and\n\n34\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.450\nthen when you have something left\nover such as on the bottom line,\n\n35\n00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.645\nnotice that I just add it then because\nmy letter was a little bit short here.\n\n36\n00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:58.298\nIt now looks like it was done on\npurpose rather than leaving one or\n\n37\n00:01:58.298 --> 00:01:59.688\ntwo lines behind.\n\n38\n00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:01.256\nAnd so that's a great place for\n\n39\n00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:04.325\nus to begin to take a look\nat something like this.\n\n40\n00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:07.755\nNow the other thing though,\nthat we can do with much longer doc,\n\n41\n00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:10.330\ncuz I don't really have\na super long document.\n\n42\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.080\nbut is to actually do what we\ncall section breaks as well.\n\n43\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.270\nNow, the idea of a section break is\na little bit different than a page break,\n\n44\n00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.590\nbecause we can actually\ntake a single page and\n\n45\n00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.150\ndivide it up into multiple\nsections that we want to.\n\n46\n00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.490\nAnd if you want me to [INAUDIBLE] why\n\n47\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.750\nwould I ever want to do\nsomething like that?\n\n48\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.250\nWell I would choose to do something\nlike that if I'm on a single page.\n\n49\n00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.080\nI couldn't actually say what I wanted to.\n\n50\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.000\nIf I was on a single page and\nthen I realized I wanted to format each\n\n51\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.300\none of those sections\na little bit differently.\n\n52\n00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.900\nAnd that way, I can actually format\nthat without having to worry\n\n53\n00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.700\nabout changing some of the options\non those other sections as well.\n\n54\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.710\nSo, let me move to a different document\nhere, which is on quotes from movies.\n\n55\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.880\nNow, you can't really read\nall the quotes on the movies.\n\n56\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.360\nHere, let me zoom in just a little bit.\n\n57\n00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.400\nBut, it's not really that important that\nyou read the quotes but this is what, I\n\n58\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.870\nthink, three or four different quotes that\nI have available for us to take a look at.\n\n59\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.850\nNow, what I can do is I can\nsimply mark off this section and\n\n60\n00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.490\nhere I'm using a technique\nover on the left-hand side,\n\n61\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.080\nthis is called a selection bar\nover here on the left-hand side.\n\n62\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.500\nAnd I kind of mentioned that\nas far as using it, but\n\n63\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.780\nI didn't mention what is\nthe official term is called.\n\n64\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.785\nBut over on the left-hand margin\nover here, if I do a single click,\n\n65\n00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:32.455\nnotice that it actually allows\nme just like one line at a time.\n\n66\n00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:37.770\nBut if I do a double-click,\nI can select one paragraph at a time.\n\n67\n00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.430\nAnd then, if I do a triple- click, one,\ntwo, three [LAUGH], it actually allows me\n\n68\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.870\nto select the entire document and\nall this stuff that's in it at one time.\n\n69\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.310\nSo, I don't have to go and highlight\neverything manually as I normally do.\n\n70\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.280\nSuch as.\n\n71\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.810\nLet me see if I don't drag everything off,\nhere.\n\n72\n00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.760\nSuch as clicking and dragging down, but\n\n73\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.380\nI can actually just simply just use those\nparticular ways to do stuff like that.\n\n74\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.920\nAnd then I can click and\ndrag down as well, to control that too.\n\n75\n00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.190\n&gt;&gt; So I have a question here, Ronny.\n\n76\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.640\nIn the past, I would go ahead and\n\n77\n00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.310\nhold the control key down when you're\ntrying to deselect a portion of that text.\n\n78\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.330\nDoes Microsoft Word allow us to do that,\nalso?\n\n79\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.310\n&gt;&gt; It still does.\n\n80\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.900\nIt allows you to actually select.\n\n81\n00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.780\nLet's say that you wanted to\nselect a few different things.\n\n82\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.160\nWell, you have a couple of ways\nthat you can do that, as well.\n\n83\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.730\nSo you can actually do a control and\nthen let's see if it allows me to.\n\n84\n00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.050\nAt this point I can't make it work here,\nwhy not?\n\n85\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.755\nIt's maybe my hand control\nmore than anything else.\n\n86\n00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:39.260\nI'm trying to see if I\ncan select more than two.\n\n87\n00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.720\nLet's see.\n\n88\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.190\nI'm actually moving stuff around, so\nI don't think I'm actually doing it.\n\n89\n00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.720\nSo it's either my control,\nI can't do it right now, or\n\n90\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.570\nyou can do it but\nI'm just not able to do so.\n\n91\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.887\nBut, it does normally allow you to\ndeselect certain text if you need to, so\n\n92\n00:04:53.887 --> 00:04:57.740\nthat even if you have discontinuous text,\nyou can do that as well.\n\n93\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.250\nSo, I can just go in and\nI can select this.\n\n94\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.470\nI can use the control key and\njust select another word.\n\n95\n00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.080\nSee, I can't do it right here.\n\n96\n00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.390\nI know what it is, I'm actually\nhitting the wrong key, how's that.\n\n97\n00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.890\nLet me see if I can do it once again.\n\n98\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.183\nSo I select one, and then I can select.\n\n99\n00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:17.890\nI don't think I'm actually\nhaving the ability to do so.\n\n100\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.795\nSo, it's my hand control. [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; On a Windows, does it work, or\n\n101\n00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:20.531\njust because.\n\n102\n00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:22.423\nIt's probably because I'm on a Mac\ncomputer, is what's happening here.\n\n103\n00:05:22.423 --> 00:05:23.312\n&gt;&gt; I know, that's Mac's.\n\n104\n00:05:23.312 --> 00:05:24.422\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm trying but\n\n105\n00:05:24.422 --> 00:05:26.198\nit's just not allowing me to do.\n\n106\n00:05:26.198 --> 00:05:29.491\nWhat I think I should be able to do here,\nso yeah, it's just not working, but\n\n107\n00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:30.213\nyou can do that.\n\n108\n00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:31.170\n&gt;&gt; But try it, yeah.\n\n109\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can try it on your home,\nif you're on a regular standard\n\n110\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.150\nkeyboard here,\nI'm actually not on a standard keyboard.\n\n111\n00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.440\nSo I just kinda realize that you have that\nability to do stuff like that as well.\n\n112\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.560\nNow, we were actually talking about\nthe idea of Section Breaks too.\n\n113\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.130\nNow remember that this allows\nme to divide up the page and say\n\n114\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.100\nI want formatting to stay in this section,\nand not really affect everything else.\n\n115\n00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.830\nYou might do this if you're\ninserting in a quote from somebody.\n\n116\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.070\nYou might do this if you're actually\nadding in additional information from\n\n117\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.020\nanother team as well.\n\n118\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.750\nAnd I've done this when we've actually\ncompiled multiple reports together,\n\n119\n00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.690\nfrom different departments and we wanted\nto combine them into one document.\n\n120\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.878\nBut they have their distinct way of doing,\ntheir formatting.\n\n121\n00:06:11.878 --> 00:06:15.080\nWell I can simply highlight and\ncopy all the text in one, and\n\n122\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.680\nbring it in to the other one.\n\n123\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.850\nBut then, sometimes they have extra marks\nand they have extra things in there.\n\n124\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:21.750\nBut then when I change it,\n\n125\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.810\nit actually changes the page flow,\nit does all the stuff like that.\n\n126\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.380\nI instead can actually create what\nwe called Section Breaks that can\n\n127\n00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.500\nhelp us out.\n\n128\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.200\nSo let's see if I can do that right now.\n\n129\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.018\nSo if I go ahead and select this,\nthen I can go to, let me make sure here.\n\n130\n00:06:36.018 --> 00:06:36.755\nPage Layout.\n\n131\n00:06:36.755 --> 00:06:38.640\nI just wanted to make\nsure before I told you.\n\n132\n00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.230\nThe Page Layout tab, and once I select\nthat, notice in the grouping here\n\n133\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.687\ncalled Page Setup, then I have this\nidea that's called Breaks too.\n\n134\n00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.800\nSo if I click on this little\ndrop down beside that.\n\n135\n00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.660\nNotice that I have this idea of\nSection Breaks that are available.\n\n136\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.540\nI can go ahead and\n\n137\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.280\ninsert the Section Break and\nstart a new section on the next page.\n\n138\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.787\nSo it can work like just a regular\npage break, I can do it Continuous and\n\n139\n00:07:03.787 --> 00:07:06.170\nthis is the one that I normally do.\n\n140\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.852\nIs the idea of Continuous here of why\nwe're trying to merge documents together.\n\n141\n00:07:09.852 --> 00:07:12.470\nBut we still wanted to keep\nthe formatting separate.\n\n142\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.465\nOr even pages, notice this one's\nactually a little bit more unusual.\n\n143\n00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:23.418\nInsert say Section Break and start the new\nsection on the next even numbered page.\n\n144\n00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:26.730\n&gt;&gt; Very specific. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And of course\nyou can do it on odd pages, you name it.\n\n145\n00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.350\nThere's a bunch of them.\n\n146\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.895\nBut let me go ahead and\ndo a Continuous one.\n\n147\n00:07:30.895 --> 00:07:34.771\nAnd now, you're like,\nthat did absolutely nothing, 100%,\n\n148\n00:07:34.771 --> 00:07:37.780\nabsolutely nothing happened there.\n\n149\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.450\nBut, we don't normally see what happened\nuntil I come back to the home and\n\n150\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.280\nthen I select right here on the Show/Hide.\n\n151\n00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.753\nAnd now notice that I now have what is\ncalled a Continuous section break here.\n\n152\n00:07:51.753 --> 00:07:53.720\nWhere it started.\n\n153\n00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.835\nSo now once I've gotten that\ndone I can then come down here.\n\n154\n00:07:57.835 --> 00:08:01.510\nAnd I'll start my second paragraph, and I\ndon't even have to do that I can probably\n\n155\n00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.520\njust put it like right\nhere at the beginning.\n\n156\n00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.278\nAnd then go back to page layout and\ninsert in the other one here, okay.\n\n157\n00:08:09.278 --> 00:08:12.797\nAnd now notice that I now have\nthe section break in-between so\n\n158\n00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:16.519\nthat allows me to do that where I\ncan have different formatting and\n\n159\n00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:20.666\neven different margins in-between if\nI wanted to to set something off.\n\n160\n00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:25.323\nSo let's take, for an example, I wanted\nthis one to stand out by having different\n\n161\n00:08:25.323 --> 00:08:29.480\nmargins, but I wanted the rest\nof the page to flow nicely.\n\n162\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.805\nSo it's right here that I can simply\ntake this particular, well I say I can.\n\n163\n00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:37.215\nIf I can quit clicking on everything and\n\n164\n00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:39.255\nmaking everything float around\nthe way that I want to.\n\n165\n00:08:39.255 --> 00:08:41.965\n&gt;&gt; There's another little trick aside\nfrom the one that you're showing here,\n\n166\n00:08:41.965 --> 00:08:43.655\nif you hold down your Shift key and\n\n167\n00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:46.925\nclick on the very first\ncharacter of that paragraph, and\n\n168\n00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:50.335\nthe very last character, it will go ahead\nand highlight everything in between too.\n\n169\n00:08:50.335 --> 00:08:51.865\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.275\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that you can do a lot\n\n171\n00:08:53.275 --> 00:08:56.220\nof these different things,\nbut let me change the margin.\n\n172\n00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.360\nSo now if I select the custom,\nlet me see, do I need to do it this way?\n\n173\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.910\nI'm gonna have to do it this way.\n\n174\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.110\nSo inside of this margin here,\nlet me verify that this is gonna work.\n\n175\n00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.640\nSo I might choose to make this one and\na half, and then the right margin,\n\n176\n00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.530\nlet's do one and a half over here, and\n\n177\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.780\nnow notice where it only really affected\nthat section, but not everything else.\n\n178\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.050\nSo this is where you might have\nthat stand out to say, hey,\n\n179\n00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.840\nhere is this particular quotation that\nwe're doing, or here is a long quote,\n\n180\n00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.030\na section of a book that you wanted\nto quote, whatever it might be.\n\n181\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.930\nBut you didn't want to have to go in and\nactually manually\n\n182\n00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.420\nmake all these indentions and\nthese different tab margins.\n\n183\n00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:36.970\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n184\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.420\n&gt;&gt; There's different tab\nstops that you have to make.\n\n185\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.740\nBut allows you to do something like that.\n\n186\n00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.750\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Nice visual\n\n187\n00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.350\nlike an aesthetic look to it as well.\n\n188\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.390\nMake sure-\n&gt;&gt; It really does help because it is\n\n189\n00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.550\noffsetting it to make it\ndisplay the way that you want.\n\n190\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.770\nBut notice that it's really not\naffecting the rest of the document.\n\n191\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.150\nAnd that can be really crucial If\nyou were given, let's say 40 pages,\n\n192\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.930\nthat you have inside of a larger document,\nand you can't seem to make it fit in\n\n193\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.890\nbesides 45 pages and they're telling you,\nyou gotta fit it in 40 pages, here.\n\n194\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:08.940\nWell, don't forget,\n\n195\n00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.860\nyou can use this even with a combination\nof changing fonts and different things.\n\n196\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.750\nTo kinda massage things around, and\nso, when you change the margins,\n\n197\n00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.690\nwhen you do that you can actually\nmake it fit a little bit better.\n\n198\n00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.790\nMake it stand out and you name it.\n\n199\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.810\nThis really does help, especially in super\nlong documents more than anything else.\n\n200\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.690\nWhen we start taking a look at\nthings like section breaks, too.\n\n201\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.510\nNow the other thing\nthat we have available,\n\n202\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.020\nsince we're actually right here in page\nsetup, we might as well go ahead and\n\n203\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.420\ntake a look at some of\nthese some other features.\n\n204\n00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.900\nWe can change our page orientation of\ncourse, if we we're actually including\n\n205\n00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:47.380\nthis into, something that everybody is\nnow printing the long edge instead along\n\n206\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:53.120\nthe paper by simply selecting Landscape or\nI can actually do Portrait here as well.\n\n207\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.110\nSo now, notice that here that I have\nthe section break, and look it's actually\n\n208\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:03.630\nadded in a different page for us to try\nand do that since I did that wrongly.\n\n209\n00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.150\nSo let me go ahead and back up on that.\n\n210\n00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.580\nSo here's the break that I was in.\n\n211\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.390\nAnd so when I selected Orientation and\n\n212\n00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.080\nLandscape, notice it simply put\nthat into a different page.\n\n213\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.830\nIf I scroll down and look at the other\npage it's still the same way instead.\n\n214\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.000\nSo if you had a chart\nthat you inserted in.\n\n215\n00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.080\nYou create your own section,\nyou put that in and\n\n216\n00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.620\nthat now actually adds\nthe chart in differently.\n\n217\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.520\nSo you do have something like that but\nit's not affecting everything else.\n\n218\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.230\nSo section breaks along with\nthe idea of the page orientation\n\n219\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.650\nis another key factor too.\n\n220\n00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.860\nNow, right next to that of course is\nalso the page side, size, excuse me.\n\n221\n00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.300\nNow, in terms of the page size, well,\nyou have different types of pages or\n\n222\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.590\ndifferent standards of sizes and\nright here in the US, most of the time,\n\n223\n00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.220\nthe idea of the standard letter,\n8.5 x 11 as what you can see.\n\n224\n00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.500\nBut there are other ones here.\n\n225\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.410\nThe legal size statements, envelopes.\n\n226\n00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.720\nThere's all different ones that\nyou have available to you.\n\n227\n00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.930\nAnd then you actually ensure that you're\nselecting the proper page size for\n\n228\n00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.680\nwhatever you're gonna print on, and\nyou're not having to reduce it down.\n\n229\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.350\nRight from the beginning when\nyou type it in you're gonna\n\n230\n00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.250\nsee exactly what it looks like.\n\n231\n00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:19.670\nIf you're like me and you've had to take\nregular documents that fit on 8.5 x 11 and\n\n232\n00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.500\nthen you change it to a legal document\ninstead and your particular paper or\n\n233\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.940\nwhatever you have went\nfrom 40 pages to 33.\n\n234\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.790\nYou're like, no,\nI needed it to be 40 pages.\n\n235\n00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.770\nWell, that's kind of harsh.\n\n236\n00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.250\nSo making sure that you start off with the\nright page size is gonna be essential for\n\n237\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.320\nthings that you can also do as well, okay?\n\n238\n00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.040\nNow if you are working\nwith long documents,\n\n239\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.590\none of the other key features that you\nhave available to you is the insertion,\n\n240\n00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.830\nof course, page numbers as well.\n\n241\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.680\nAll right, now page numbers can go\nanywhere that you want to in the document.\n\n242\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.460\nBut they normally go\ninside of page headers or\n\n243\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.050\npage footers, usually I like them in the\npage footer instead is what I like to do.\n\n244\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.900\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ncreate that idea of a page footer and\n\n245\n00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.640\nthen insert the page numbers out.\n\n246\n00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.390\nOkay, so that will help us to\nunderstand what happens here now.\n\n247\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.400\nWhen we talk about creating page footers\nI remember in typewriting class,\n\n248\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.330\nI know that's a little bit\nforeign to most people.\n\n249\n00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.350\nBut in typewriting class creating page\nheaders and page footers were a nightmare.\n\n250\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.150\nYou had to kinda measure it out and then\nyou had to pack the space down and then\n\n251\n00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.280\nyou had to make sure everything else fit\nin there the way that you wanted it to.\n\n252\n00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.830\nYou had to relay out\n\n253\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.390\nthe flow of the document if things didn't\nwork out in the way that you wanted to.\n\n254\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.560\nBut inside a Microsoft Word,\n\n255\n00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.980\nall I have to do is come here to\nthe lower portion of it, or try to.\n\n256\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.090\nLet me see.\n\n257\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.090\nI might have to go up to the top portion.\n\n258\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.930\nThere we go.\n\n259\n00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.390\nSo, I thought I could do it on\nthe lower half of the page,\n\n260\n00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.920\nI can do it at the top part of the page.\n\n261\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.930\nAnd notice it lays out a header here\non the section is what it does.\n\n262\n00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.620\nNow this one's a little bit strange\nbecause I have chosen this particular page\n\n263\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.560\nto do so, now let me go to\nanother document instead that\n\n264\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.400\nmakes it a little bit easier for\nus to see this.\n\n265\n00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.330\nSo what I'm gonna do is the exact same\nthing which is simply double-click\n\n266\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.990\nup here and now notice that the header\nis automatically laid out for me.\n\n267\n00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:21.670\nBut along with that if I scroll down,\nI also see this idea of the footer.\n\n268\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.540\nSo now it actually marks\noff the section and\n\n269\n00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:30.270\nI can click inside of it and\nthen once I have something like that,\n\n270\n00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:35.200\nI now simply go ahead and say where\nI want the actual page number to be.\n\n271\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.620\nCherokee, I can put it on the left side,\nI can put it on the right side, or\n\n272\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.390\nright in the middle.\n\n273\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:38.990\nWhere do you normally?\n\n274\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.100\n&gt;&gt; I normally always go to\nthe bottom right corner, but\n\n275\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.640\nI think it's kind of fancy\nwhen it's in the middle.\n\n276\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.140\n&gt;&gt; In the middle?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:45.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n278\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.740\nthe neat thing is then all I have to do is\nactually readjust this, so I'm gonna click\n\n279\n00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:55.400\non Home and then, under the paragraph,\nI'm simply going to center it right here.\n\n280\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.160\nAnd now if I go back into,\nthis is something that I should mention.\n\n281\n00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.120\nSo once I did this, notice that I now\nhave something a little bit different.\n\n282\n00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.560\nCherokee, look at that.\n\n283\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.190\nThat actually appeared,\nsomething brand new.\n\n284\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.100\n&gt;&gt; Header and Footer tab, yeah.\n\n285\n00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.290\n&gt;&gt; Header and Footer.\n\n286\n00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.670\nSo you have what we call\ncontextual menus as well.\n\n287\n00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.080\nIt only appears when you have\nsections that lit up like this and\n\n288\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.910\nthey essentially allow you to add\nin well an extra set of tools\n\n289\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.060\nthat normally is not revealed\nwhen you don't have it.\n\n290\n00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:22.720\nSo let me show you.\n\n291\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.340\n&gt;&gt; Specific to that\ncommand that you're in.\n\n292\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:24.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n293\n00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.980\n&gt;&gt; So if I click off of this, watch,\nlet me see if I close all that, okay?\n\n294\n00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.920\nSo if I close that header normally all\nI have to do is click inside the doc,\n\n295\n00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.380\nmine's not working the way\nI want it to right now.\n\n296\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.380\nWell if I close that notice\nthat it's gone up here, okay.\n\n297\n00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.610\nNow if I go ahead and\nlay it back out it adds it back in and\n\n298\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.780\ngives us a little bit splash of color so\nthat we can see this.\n\n299\n00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.010\nAnd then I'm gonna come down\nhere to the bottom of this page.\n\n300\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:53.710\nAnd since everything is centered I can\nnow go over to the left hand side and\n\n301\n00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.114\nunder Header and\nFooter here I can now go to Page Number.\n\n302\n00:15:58.114 --> 00:16:01.032\nAnd I can say at the,\noop, bottom of the page.\n\n303\n00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.966\nAnd then select right here.\n\n304\n00:16:03.966 --> 00:16:06.706\nLet's just do a plain page number.\n\n305\n00:16:06.706 --> 00:16:09.550\nAnd now I'm gonna close out the header and\nfooter.\n\n306\n00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.670\nAnd on this one there's only two pages.\n\n307\n00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.710\nBut I don't have to\nactually renumber this.\n\n308\n00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.480\nSo now there it is,\nthere's the bottom of page two.\n\n309\n00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.280\nAnd it's added this right\ninto the actual page footer.\n\n310\n00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.830\nYou might be wondering like,\nwhy does it matter on two-page doc?\n\n311\n00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.230\nIt really doesn't, right?\n\n312\n00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:32.250\nBut on 15, 20, 30 page doc, it really is\nhelpful because if you ever walk with\n\n313\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.650\na stack of papers down the hallway, like\nI have, and had too many things in your\n\n314\n00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:42.060\nhand and accidentally dropped them, and\nevery single page looks almost identical.\n\n315\n00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.180\nThen I have to go back through and reread.\n\n316\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.265\n&gt;&gt; Or even a meeting.\n\n317\n00:16:45.265 --> 00:16:46.909\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, meeting.\n&gt;&gt; And you're like hey, Ronnie,\n\n318\n00:16:46.909 --> 00:16:48.060\nwe're on page 4800.\n\n319\n00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n320\n00:16:49.335 --> 00:16:50.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n321\n00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.670\njust even flipping through and\nbeing able to find that.\n\n322\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.680\nBut something like that,\njust page numbers are really helpful.\n\n323\n00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.000\nAnd what you're gonna also end up learning\nat some point in the future, not here.\n\n324\n00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.930\nBut if you actually do want to learn more,\nwe do have courses on that as well\n\n325\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.090\nthat you can go in, and\nas a member you'll be able to access too.\n\n326\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.084\nWhere you can actually see how you can\nincorporate other documents into it and\n\n327\n00:17:11.084 --> 00:17:13.801\nit will automatically add\nthe page numbers into it.\n\n328\n00:17:13.801 --> 00:17:17.360\nAnd sometimes you might actually see where\nyou choose to add in additional things.\n\n329\n00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.110\nBut right now, as far we know,\n\n330\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.670\npage number is pretty much the way that\nwe want to deal with this too, okay?\n\n331\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:28.130\nAll right, so from that point I'm gonna\ngo back to this document here for\n\n332\n00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.270\njust a moment.\n\n333\n00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.420\nAnd I'm gonna do something so\n\n334\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.970\nthat I don't have to actually worry\nabout changing everything back out here.\n\n335\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.480\nIs I'm simply gonna close out\nof that document right now.\n\n336\n00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.160\n&gt;&gt; I noticed you didn't save.\n\n337\n00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.320\n&gt;&gt; I did not save it.\n\n338\n00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.980\n&gt;&gt; Intentionally.\n\n339\n00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.920\n&gt;&gt; Yep, intentionally,\nbecause I wanna open that one back up for\n\n340\n00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.310\nthe next thing that we\nwanna talk about here.\n\n341\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:53.070\nWhich is going to be the idea of\nworking with multiple columns, okay?\n\n342\n00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.448\nSo here I have three\ndifferent columns here, okay?\n\n343\n00:17:56.448 --> 00:17:58.340\nThat's what I wanna do.\n\n344\n00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.980\nAnd I wanna go ahead and\ncompare these quotes if I want to, okay?\n\n345\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n346\n00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.950\nI want to put them in a column format.\n\n347\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.210\nSo let's change this up,\n\n348\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.950\nbecause I know it's going to be too\nsquished in the current layout.\n\n349\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.430\nI go to page layout select orientation and\nlandscape.\n\n350\n00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:21.090\nThat way, when I have it here, I wanna\ncreate multiple columns, I can do this.\n\n351\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.630\nSo at the very top of the page here,\nI'm gonna hit another Enter so\n\n352\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.030\nI know that I have a paragraph above it.\n\n353\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.880\nThen I can come up here to Page Setup,\nand then I can say three columns.\n\n354\n00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.600\nNow once I do that, Ronnie, look at that.\n\n355\n00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.640\n&gt;&gt; A little messy?\n\n356\n00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not only a little messy,\nit's not in three columns.\n\n357\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:41.440\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n358\n00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's-\n&gt;&gt; Two columns.\n\n359\n00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.268\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kinda two columns, instead.\n\n360\n00:18:46.268 --> 00:18:47.862\nYou didn't do what you thought\nthat you were gonna do.\n\n361\n00:18:47.862 --> 00:18:51.132\n&gt;&gt; I see three columns in the margin,\nthat ruler up top, but\n\n362\n00:18:51.132 --> 00:18:53.100\nthe text didn't fill over.\n\n363\n00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what can we do here?\n\n364\n00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.180\nOkay, well, a couple of things we can do.\n\n365\n00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.260\nI'm gonna click at\nthe paragraph down here.\n\n366\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.510\nAnd then I am going to select a break.\n\n367\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.530\nAnd now notice I have a column break.\n\n368\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.520\nAnd then I'm gonna select my third one.\n\n369\n00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.343\nAnd then I'm gonna go up here to break\nagain and select another column break.\n\n370\n00:19:14.343 --> 00:19:18.514\nAnd now, oops, I probably didn't need\n\n371\n00:19:18.514 --> 00:19:24.280\nthat extra sign here, There we go.\n\n372\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.320\nAnd now you can take a look.\n\n373\n00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.890\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n\n374\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.740\nAnd there it is,\nthere are my three columns that I have.\n\n375\n00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:34.670\nSo I can actually use a combination of\nbreaks as well as the column tool that's\n\n376\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:39.840\nin here to create multiple columns, so\nit can set up the way that we want it to.\n\n377\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.420\nSo, it really can help you out if you\njust learn a few of the tools and\n\n378\n00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.870\nthen you start using them in combination.\n\n379\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.190\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt, Ronnie.\n\n380\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.450\nI'm just sitting here and\nI'm thinking, wow.\n\n381\n00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.810\nI'm really gonna be able\nto help my kids with\n\n382\n00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.246\ntheir book reports [LAUGH] even better!\n\n383\n00:19:52.246 --> 00:19:53.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n384\n00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.660\nthere's a lot that we can do here, right?\n\n385\n00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.950\nSo then, we can kind of take\na little bit at a time and\n\n386\n00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.810\nstart changing it up a little bit.\n\n387\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.920\nSo, let's change that to\nsomething else that will be\n\n388\n00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.490\njust a little bit more lively here.\n\n389\n00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.130\nNow I can change that up.\n\n390\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.894\nI like that Calibri text,\nI don't know why.\n\n391\n00:20:12.894 --> 00:20:20.110\nAnd here another one, and I'll change this\nto, I don't know, Arial, let's do that.\n\n392\n00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.460\nI was trying to make it bigger,\nis what I wanted to do as well.\n\n393\n00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.700\nBut not go over that third column.\n\n394\n00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.420\nAnd then this other one here,\nthese are from some of my favorite movies.\n\n395\n00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.170\nI just picked them up as I was\ntrying to get ready and I was like,\n\n396\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.750\nhow do I wanna show this stuff?\n\n397\n00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.900\nSo just trying to pick\nout a font that I like.\n\n398\n00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.285\nThis is always the hardest part for me,\n\n399\n00:20:41.285 --> 00:20:44.890\nis actually picking out something I\nreally like more than anything else.\n\n400\n00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:45.650\nYeah, that'll work.\n\n401\n00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.620\nAnd then change that.\n\n402\n00:20:50.775 --> 00:20:54.545\nAnd now you can see where I kind of\nhave them just about even sizes, or\n\n403\n00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:59.440\nsome a little bit bigger than the others,\nbut you may actually choose to do that.\n\n404\n00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.760\nSo it really is about\nwhat you need to see and\n\n405\n00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.450\nnotice that Word can help you to do that.\n\n406\n00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.670\nSo very fancy in terms of elements\nthat you have ready to go.\n\n407\n00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.900\nBut things that you might be\nable to do as well, okay?\n\n408\n00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.870\nSo just kinda realize that you\ndo have those elements too.\n\n409\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.160\nNow, along with this, of course,\nmeans that you may also need to add in\n\n410\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.490\njust a little bit of sprinkling\nof some graphics as well.\n\n411\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.220\nSo we wanna change that up too, okay?\n\n412\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.020\nSo I'm gonna see if I\ncan triple click here.\n\n413\n00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.540\nWhoop, I'm almost got it.\n\n414\n00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.764\nAnd Ronnie is working with a trackpad, so-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's me,\n\n415\n00:21:37.764 --> 00:21:39.122\nI can't blame the trackpad.\n\n416\n00:21:39.122 --> 00:21:41.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's okay [LAUGH].\n\n417\n00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:42.600\n&gt;&gt; I'd love to.\n\n418\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.810\nBut I wanted to actually make\na little bit of room here, okay?\n\n419\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.620\nNow what if I wanted to insert\nan additional image in here?\n\n420\n00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.810\nSo let me go ahead and do this as well.\n\n421\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.040\nI'm gonna insert in a new break here.\n\n422\n00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.940\nSo let's do this, well, I'm going to\ndo a continuous break at this point.\n\n423\n00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.890\nAnd that way I'm actually moving this and\nseparating it out and\n\n424\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.110\nnow I wanna insert in a picture.\n\n425\n00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.410\nWell, the great thing is I can\ngo to Insert and select Picture.\n\n426\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.770\nAnd then I think on my desktop here,\nI have a picture,\n\n427\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.910\nsomething that we just made, Cherokee.\n\n428\n00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.397\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] well,\nwe are those crazy people.\n\n429\n00:22:17.397 --> 00:22:18.196\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n430\n00:22:18.196 --> 00:22:20.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n431\n00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:22.459\n&gt;&gt; Oops, maybe I broke it.\n\n432\n00:22:22.459 --> 00:22:25.077\n&gt;&gt; Or the column.\n\n433\n00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:27.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the column,\nso that's what I get for\n\n434\n00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.930\nnot, let me back off from that for\na moment here.\n\n435\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.730\nYes, still in the column I\nthought I had done a page break.\n\n436\n00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.740\nLet me do a page break instead.\n\n437\n00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.630\nAnd that will, hopefully,\nhelp us out here.\n\n438\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.160\nI thought a section break would do it,\nbut apparently not.\n\n439\n00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.160\nSo we'll do a page break.\n\n440\n00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.660\nAnd now, I'm still in those three columns,\nso let me change a column back to one.\n\n441\n00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.020\nHopefully, that will help us [LAUGH].\n\n442\n00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:52.850\n&gt;&gt; I think you'll be good.\n\n443\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:57.104\n&gt;&gt; And then do a picture,\nselect our screenshot.\n\n444\n00:22:58.737 --> 00:23:00.368\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n445\n00:23:00.368 --> 00:23:02.344\nSo now I can add in a picture and\nstretched out like that.\n\n446\n00:23:02.344 --> 00:23:05.764\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was gonna say,\nif you hold down the Shift key,\n\n447\n00:23:05.764 --> 00:23:09.493\nit's gonna keep the size ratio\nappropriate there [LAUGH].\n\n448\n00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there you go.\n\n449\n00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So that will work for\n\n450\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.730\nus when we start to do stuff too, okay?\n\n451\n00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.880\nSo using this picture, we can add\nin additional elements like this.\n\n452\n00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.170\nNow you might not do this every time, but\nyou can do certain things like this as\n\n453\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.740\nwell that will also help us out too,\nall right?\n\n454\n00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.430\nSo I'm gonna also copy this, and then\nwe're gonna go back to another document\n\n455\n00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.544\nand add it in, let's say,\nCherokee, I wanted to put it,\n\n456\n00:23:35.544 --> 00:23:39.580\nlet's say right over here\ninside in this paragraph here.\n\n457\n00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.290\n&gt;&gt; I don't care where you put it,\njust don't stretch me again.\n\n458\n00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.207\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n459\n00:23:43.207 --> 00:23:44.090\n&gt;&gt; Here we go, here.\n\n460\n00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.950\nHow's that?\n\n461\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.804\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm on a diet, there we go.\n\n462\n00:23:47.804 --> 00:23:51.156\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, Cherokee, even though\nI can do something like this here, and\n\n463\n00:23:51.156 --> 00:23:54.207\nI can control it, and I can make it\na little bit smaller so it actually fits\n\n464\n00:23:54.207 --> 00:23:56.829\nbetter Do you see something\na little bit weird about the text?\n\n465\n00:23:56.829 --> 00:23:59.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not fitting properly,\nit just looks squished in there.\n\n466\n00:23:59.452 --> 00:24:02.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like that\nit was inserted in there.\n\n467\n00:24:02.325 --> 00:24:04.470\nAnd even though it was,\n\n468\n00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:10.190\nthe cool thing about Microsoft Word is\nthat we can change that as well, okay?\n\n469\n00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:15.143\nSo, what I can do is I can select\nthat contextual tab here, and\n\n470\n00:24:15.143 --> 00:24:19.350\nthen I can go over to this\narea where it says arrange.\n\n471\n00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.490\nLet me make I zoom in there.\n\n472\n00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.590\nAnd then I have this\nthing called wrap text.\n\n473\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:29.370\nSo, at this point,\nI can stay in line with the text or\n\n474\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.240\nI can make it flow around it in a square.\n\n475\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.210\nA little bit tighter through the text,\nyou don't want to, but let's just use this\n\n476\n00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.790\nsquare for right now, cuz that\none's the one that seems to happen.\n\n477\n00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.327\nAnd now when you take a look, notice that.\n\n478\n00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:47.270\nSo, we can take that image in that\npicture, if I wanted to, and move it.\n\n479\n00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.800\nThat's not good, but\nI can move it to the other margin.\n\n480\n00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.750\nI can move it down here.\n\n481\n00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.710\nAnd notice this is actually allowing\nthe text to flow around it as well.\n\n482\n00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:01.671\nSo, different ways that you can do this,\nif we want to we can even.\n\n483\n00:25:01.671 --> 00:25:03.774\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Have the fancy tilt.\n\n484\n00:25:03.774 --> 00:25:10.102\nAnd then can go to that wrap text and\nlet's see, there you go,\n\n485\n00:25:10.102 --> 00:25:15.606\nlittle bit tight through,\nsquare still the best wa.\n\n486\n00:25:15.606 --> 00:25:17.661\nStill terrible, shouldn't do that.\n\n487\n00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:19.039\n&gt;&gt; And I always wanna go ahead and\n\n488\n00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:21.795\nplay with the formatting right\nafter I insert the picture,\n\n489\n00:25:21.795 --> 00:25:25.970\nbecause even if you put it in, you don't\ndo anything with it and it looks okay.\n\n490\n00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.620\nIf you go and edit back the actual\ntext and it moves things around,\n\n491\n00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.040\nyou could come back and\nit looks all crazy and wonky afterwards.\n\n492\n00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.590\nSo you do wanna put it,\nyou wanna use those features so\n\n493\n00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.370\nyou can get it just the way you want it.\n\n494\n00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.594\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that\nthere's a lot of this going on.\n\n495\n00:25:40.594 --> 00:25:44.150\nAlong with these of course, are features\nthat you can do to the image itself.\n\n496\n00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.530\nSo, notice that here on the upper right\nhand corner we also have this idea of\n\n497\n00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.105\ncropping the picture if we need to.\n\n498\n00:25:49.105 --> 00:25:51.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can crop it to a different shape.\n\n499\n00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.584\nOr we can actually use some of\nthe handles here to crop out some of\n\n500\n00:25:55.584 --> 00:25:59.538\nthe extra space that I have around\nthe edge here, if I wanted to.\n\n501\n00:25:59.538 --> 00:26:04.263\nSo, all I've to do is select here, and\nnow notice it gives me these handles\n\n502\n00:26:04.263 --> 00:26:07.715\nthat I can now drag and\ntake out some of the extra space.\n\n503\n00:26:07.715 --> 00:26:12.120\n&gt;&gt; So this is really gonna age me here,\nbut whenever I was working as\n\n504\n00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.701\na yearbook editor we actually had\ngrease pencils to crop with [LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:19.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n506\n00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.860\nA grease pencil, all right.\n\n507\n00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.470\nSo different ways that we can use some\nof the tools that are available, but\n\n508\n00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.410\nCherokee, there's a bit more for us to\nshow but I think I'm actually out of time.\n\n509\n00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.490\nSo I think we're gonna have\nto go with [CROSSTALK]\n\n510\n00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.901\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It happens sometimes,\n\n511\n00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:33.976\nwhat do you say Ronny?\n\n512\n00:26:33.976 --> 00:26:37.921\nLet's go ahead and we'll have\na part three, how does that sound?\n\n513\n00:26:37.921 --> 00:26:38.524\n&gt;&gt; It sounds good.\n\n514\n00:26:38.524 --> 00:26:41.534\n&gt;&gt; All right, so thank you guys so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n515\n00:26:41.534 --> 00:26:42.749\nWe're gonna go head and\n\n516\n00:26:42.749 --> 00:26:46.350\nwrap up this episode but stay tuned\nwe have more shows coming your way.\n\n517\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.410\nI'm gonna go head and\nsign off as your host Cherokee Boost.\n\n518\n00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:50.310\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.739\nWelcome to ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.138\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:07.138 --> 00:00:08.525\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:10.892\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.130\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\nIC3 Key Application show.\n\n6\n00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.150\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.780\nAnd if you ever wanted to\nbecome an Excel master,\n\n8\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.080\nthen you're definitely in the right\ndirection because today we have\n\n9\n00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.960\nRonnie Wong in studios to go ahead and\nhelp us with this topic.\n\n10\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.320\nThank you for\nbeing today here today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for inviting me back to\nthe studios as we continue to get starting\n\n12\n00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.890\nhere talking about\nproductivity applications.\n\n13\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.590\nAnd we're moving into the realm\nof working with spreadsheets.\n\n14\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.250\nAnd when we talk about the idea of\nusing Microsoft Office 2010, well,\n\n15\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.965\nMicrosoft Excel is definitely going to be\nthe program that you want to be familiar\n\n16\n00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:52.960\nwith so that you can be able to work\nwith numbers and very large numbers.\n\n17\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.930\nAnd be able to actually\nuse the processing power\n\n18\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.780\nof your computer as well as excel\nin the way they have it set up.\n\n19\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.470\nThat's really gonna help you out\ninstead of you having to manually type\n\n20\n00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.130\nthings out and\n\n21\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.770\nthen figure things out with a calculator\nand add things back in as well, okay.\n\n22\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.290\nSo that is what we're actually\ngoing to be talking about.\n\n23\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.260\nSo in a previous episode,\nwe had talked about word processors,\n\n24\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.760\nwhich allow us to type and\nbe able to put words down on paper,\n\n25\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.010\nmanipulate or\nedit them in the way that we want to.\n\n26\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.620\nBut now we're moving into Excel because we\nmay also end up working with numbers, and\n\n27\n00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.950\nit's not uncommon that you hear\nabout people tracking things such as\n\n28\n00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.620\nnumber of days that people\nare in-office versus out of office.\n\n29\n00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.847\nOr the idea of number of shows completed,\n\n30\n00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:42.835\njust like what we have\nhere at ITPro.TV studios.\n\n31\n00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.320\nThe very fact is, every host,\nlike myself and like Cherokee,\n\n32\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.760\nwe're tracked on the number of shows that\nwe also do on a daily basis as well.\n\n33\n00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.842\nAnd so we can use something like Excel\nspreadsheet to help us track things\n\n34\n00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:54.356\nlike that.\n\n35\n00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:58.846\nAnd then after a while here\nto do analysis based on that.\n\n36\n00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:01.781\nAnd so what we can do is we\ncan take that information,\n\n37\n00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:05.785\ntell Excel exactly what we want it to do,\nand then show some analysis and\n\n38\n00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:08.900\nsome other information\nbased upon that as well.\n\n39\n00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.600\nSo it's not just about the data and\nentry, but it's also about the ability\n\n40\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.360\nto analyze that data and\nhave it report out what we need to.\n\n41\n00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.180\nSo it's a very important program.\n\n42\n00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.340\nAnd at least for me, Cherokee, it's one\nof the best programs to actually learn.\n\n43\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.574\nAnd no matter what you do,\nonce you actually learn a few things,\n\n44\n00:02:25.574 --> 00:02:28.860\nit's one the more intuitive\nprograms that will allow you to\n\n45\n00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.210\nexpand your skills very rapidly.\n\n46\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.260\nSo very fun for us to get into as well.\n\n47\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait because its been a while\nsince I've really used Excel, so\n\n48\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.226\nI'm sure there's a lot\nthat I've forgotten.\n\n49\n00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:40.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, it's really easy to forget,\n\n50\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.385\ntoo, but the main thing,\nit's like riding a bicycle.\n\n51\n00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:47.000\nOnce you start to see it again,\nall of a sudden it becomes more and\n\n52\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.990\nmore practical and then it becomes easier.\n\n53\n00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.030\nMost of the time if you're just beginning,\nand\n\n54\n00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.585\nyou go, man I hope I never\nhave to work with numbers.\n\n55\n00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:57.420\nExcel's gonna make it easier for\nyou to work with numbers, and\n\n56\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.990\nthat's why it's a program that\nyou definitely want to learn.\n\n57\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.630\nAnd we wanna make sure you feel familiar\nand comfortable with it, too, so\n\n58\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.580\nwe're gonna talk about the interface at\nthe beginning and then we're gonna start\n\n59\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.320\nshowing you some of the different\nthings that you can do as well.\n\n60\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.350\nSo let's go ahead and\njump right to it then and\n\n61\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.100\nwe'll take a look at my computer\nbecause I will pull up Excel and\n\n62\n00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.340\nwe'll find it in the Microsoft Office\nProductivity Suite of Applications, too.\n\n63\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.900\nSo here it is.\n\n64\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.400\nI'm on Windows 7 and\n\n65\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.880\nI'm simply gonna click on the Start\nbutton on the lower left-hand corner.\n\n66\n00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.990\nSelect All Programs, and\nthen from there I am looking for\n\n67\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.890\nthe Microsoft Office folder.\n\n68\n00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.280\nNow you might find out that in\nmaybe in different locations.\n\n69\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.150\nBut a lot of times, if this is the first\ntime that you've been on the computer and\n\n70\n00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.760\nthey're telling you they just went\nahead and reimaged the computer.\n\n71\n00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.890\nI know I'm using big terms, but if they\ntell you that's a brand new computer,\n\n72\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.230\nessentially for you.\n\n73\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.130\nThis is more than likely how you'll\nsee it with nothing else listed there.\n\n74\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.100\nIt will be inside of Microsoft Office, and\n\n75\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.450\nfrom that point you'll see\nthe entire office suite.\n\n76\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.290\nSometimes you'll just\nsee a few programs but\n\n77\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.820\njust remember that that's\nwhat you'll end up seeing.\n\n78\n00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.210\nIt's normally listed in\nalphabetical order, so\n\n79\n00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.570\nwe are going to select right here\nwhere it says Microsoft Excel.\n\n80\n00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.850\nAnd notice it tells you what it does.\n\n81\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.590\nIt will perform calculations,\nanalyze information, visualize data.\n\n82\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.420\nSo what does that mean?\n\n83\n00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.220\nIt means it can crunch numbers, right?\n\n84\n00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.890\nWe can take those numbers in and\ndo some other things with it.\n\n85\n00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.490\nNamely the idea of charts here for\nvisualization and\n\n86\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.290\nthen to analyze so that we can make\nbetter decisions based off that.\n\n87\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.430\nSo then I'm going to use my mouse and\nclick on that one time and\n\n88\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.720\nlet me zoom back out so\nthat we can see it.\n\n89\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.500\nAnd you'll notice that if you watched\nour previous episodes on the navigation\n\n90\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.790\nthat a lot of this looks familiar\nbetween all the office products.\n\n91\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.400\nAnd that is because the key goals between\nall these applications, even though they\n\n92\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.510\ndo things that are incredibly different,\nis the idea of productivity.\n\n93\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.080\nSo they make a good portion of everything\nthat we do look very similar so\n\n94\n00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.490\nthat we can move from one program to the\nother without having to kind of relearn\n\n95\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.530\nanother new program completely.\n\n96\n00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.380\nOkay, so we're gonna be spending our time\ntaking a look at some of these tools that\n\n97\n00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.590\nare available, but the majority of it is\nsomething that you can learn on your own.\n\n98\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.550\nBut if you wanna get more in depth\nwith it, don't forget to check out our\n\n99\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.680\nlibrary here at ITPro.TV for\nmore information on Excel as well.\n\n100\n00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.490\nAll right, so let's get familiar\nwith what we're actually\n\n101\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.150\ngoing to see at the very beginning.\n\n102\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.940\nOkay, now I've opened up Excel a couple of\ndifferent times after the installation and\n\n103\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.030\nit automatically leads you to this,\n\n104\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.850\nwhich is essentially what\nwe call a blank worksheet.\n\n105\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.850\nOkay, you also opened up what is\ncalled a Workbook at the same time.\n\n106\n00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.440\nSo we'll discuss what\nthe differences between those are.\n\n107\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.200\nThe term Workbook is what\nthe file it actually is.\n\n108\n00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.800\nSo if I click on File and\nthen I select Save As,\n\n109\n00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.330\nwell, then you actually notice that\nright here it says Excel Workbook.\n\n110\n00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.350\nNow the reason why that's important\nbecause that is what they call the file\n\n111\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.030\nthat you end up working with here.\n\n112\n00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.600\nSo I'm just gonna select\nthis ITProTV Test2\n\n113\n00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.910\nhere because I was typing it\nout a little bit earlier.\n\n114\n00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.490\nOop, well, let me try it again.\n\n115\n00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.941\nOkay, so I'm gonna select that and\nI'm gonna click Save here and\n\n116\n00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:10.337\nnow it's gonna ask me if\nI want to replace it.\n\n117\n00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:11.229\nYeah, go ahead.\n\n118\n00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.230\nThere's nothing that I have in there\nthat remember, at least I hope not.\n\n119\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.940\nBut that allows me to do that.\n\n120\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.730\nAnd then notice that up here at the top,\nit says here is the workbook that I\n\n121\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.372\npulled up and here's, of course, the name\nof the program that I'm in as well.\n\n122\n00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:29.720\nYou wanna make sure that you know both\nof those as you start working with\n\n123\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.910\nmultiple Excel workbooks.\n\n124\n00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.500\nBecause of the way that numbers\nare normally stored inside of Excel,\n\n125\n00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.070\nyou may be working with data\nthat you're not supposed to be.\n\n126\n00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.850\nSo it could be that somebody said hey,\npull up this workbook and\n\n127\n00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.620\nmake sure you look at these numbers.\n\n128\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.770\nAnd then at the same time you may\nbe working on another workbook, and\n\n129\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.910\nall of a sudden you don't realize\nwhich one you're editing and\n\n130\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.950\nyou weren't supposed to edit one of them.\n\n131\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.660\nAlways pay attention to the name that\nyou're actually taking a look at\n\n132\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.730\nbefore you start manipulating anything.\n\n133\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.422\nBecause numbers that are stored in columns\nand rows, which is what we're gonna also\n\n134\n00:07:01.422 --> 00:07:04.240\nsee here in Excel, they can look\nsimilar regardless what they.\n\n135\n00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.169\n&gt;&gt; They can all blur together.\n\n136\n00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:09.310\n&gt;&gt; They do, and\nthen you start changing like 15, 16 rows.\n\n137\n00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.560\nAnd now you're like,\nI wasn't supposed to change that.\n\n138\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.230\nWell, the good thing is,\nas long as you don't save it,\n\n139\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.960\nyou can simply close out of that a lot of\ntimes and it won't save the changes or\n\n140\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.790\nit will ask you whether or not you wanna\nsave them and then you're fine, okay.\n\n141\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.680\nNow normally on the very\nfirst time you launch it, and\n\n142\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.570\nif you don't have anything listed here,\nit'll also pin it to this, which is our\n\n143\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.800\nregular start menu here, and will\nallow it to just be readily available.\n\n144\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.040\nCuz it's saying, it looks like\nyou're gonna use this program.\n\n145\n00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.162\nLet me make easier than\nyou having to search for\n\n146\n00:07:39.162 --> 00:07:42.340\nit, and then you can launch\nit up from there as well.\n\n147\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.666\nNow if this is your very\nfirst time opening this,\n\n148\n00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:48.210\nyou may find out that it actually\nopens to a different screen.\n\n149\n00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:53.866\nSo normally, the very first time it opens\nup to right here, which is the word New.\n\n150\n00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:56.743\nOkay, so you actually see\nwhere it actually goes here.\n\n151\n00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:57.911\nAnd you're probably saying, well,\n\n152\n00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:00.420\nthat doesn't look like the spreadsheet\nyou were showing me at all.\n\n153\n00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.473\nBut it has what we call different\ntemplates that are out there.\n\n154\n00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:07.403\nTemplates are such a pre-designed\nforms that you and I end up using.\n\n155\n00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:11.589\nAnd they structure everything,\nthe page size, the grid,\n\n156\n00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:14.101\nhow thick the lines are in between,\n\n157\n00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:20.140\nwhat the default font is going to be when\nyou're typing inside of those cells.\n\n158\n00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.460\nYou name it, it can do that.\n\n159\n00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.236\nAnd then they went ahead and also made\nsome different ones that are available\n\n160\n00:08:26.236 --> 00:08:28.540\nthrough office.com here, you can see that.\n\n161\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.343\nAnd that's some place online, that if you\nwere creating something like an agenda for\n\n162\n00:08:34.343 --> 00:08:38.612\na meeting, or a budget for\nyour house, or for a business or so,\n\n163\n00:08:38.612 --> 00:08:41.696\nyou don't have to\nredesign the entire form.\n\n164\n00:08:41.696 --> 00:08:45.783\nWhat you can do is actually take somebody\nelse's work that has structured it and\n\n165\n00:08:45.783 --> 00:08:49.324\nmaybe even created the basic formulas\nthat you normally need to see.\n\n166\n00:08:49.324 --> 00:08:52.704\nAnd that way all you have to do is\nnow use that pre-designed form,\n\n167\n00:08:52.704 --> 00:08:56.636\nerase some of the sample data that they\nmight have in there and you're off and\n\n168\n00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:57.759\nyou're ready to go.\n\n169\n00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:02.097\nSo this is one of the best ways to get\nstarted because it means you don't really\n\n170\n00:09:02.097 --> 00:09:05.298\nhave to know a ton about Excel\nto be able to jump right in and\n\n171\n00:09:05.298 --> 00:09:07.062\nstart creating information.\n\n172\n00:09:07.062 --> 00:09:10.354\nYou can use the idea of templates\nto really help you out.\n\n173\n00:09:10.354 --> 00:09:15.670\nAnd that's one of the normal ways\nthat we can get started too, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.825\nSo, you also end up, of course, seeing\nthat there's something else that we're\n\n175\n00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:21.370\ngonna start off with which\nis the blank workbook.\n\n176\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.520\nAnd this is the hardest one for\nus to start off with.\n\n177\n00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.740\nBecause all it's doing is really saying,\nhere's the number of cells that you\n\n178\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.860\nhave available, and it gives us lines\nin between so that we have a grid.\n\n179\n00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.670\nAnd, like I said,\nit does everything else, but\n\n180\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.580\nit's not pre-structured to do something\nlike a form or track an inventory or\n\n181\n00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.650\neven scheduling like you see here.\n\n182\n00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.360\nIt's just gonna be blank, and\nthat's what we're gonna start off with.\n\n183\n00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.060\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n184\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.570\n&gt;&gt; Yep, why not?\n\n185\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.310\nSo I'm going to select that.\n\n186\n00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.510\nAnd I tried to double click on it,\nand it didn't work.\n\n187\n00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.150\nBut over here on the right hand side,\nyou'll see right\n\n188\n00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.280\nhere if we can take a look at that,\nright behind my head here for a moment.\n\n189\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.960\nYou'll see this create button.\n\n190\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.790\nSo double-clicking on it didn't work.\n\n191\n00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.820\nAnd if you double-click on something\ninside of Excel and it doesn't work,\n\n192\n00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.390\nmake sure you take a look and notice and\nlook for what we call a verb.\n\n193\n00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.580\nAnd here it is, here's that verb Create.\n\n194\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.520\nAnd that brings you right back to this\nidea of the blank workbook, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.830\nSo that is really where we are going to\nbegin to start off taking a look as well.\n\n196\n00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.760\nNow, on the interface, the thing\nthat makes this different from what\n\n197\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.950\nwe've seen in Office products,\nbegins really underneath this ribbon.\n\n198\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.870\nNow if you're on a small machine\nlike I'm on as well, okay, and\n\n199\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.000\nyou can transfer this over to Word,\nyou can transfer this somewhere else.\n\n200\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.310\nAnd you don't need to see all these tools\nright now, you can simply double click on\n\n201\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.620\nany tab and notice that collapses\nthat entire ribbon down.\n\n202\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.360\nSo that you can get more\nspace on your screen.\n\n203\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.869\nSo I'm on a 13 inch laptop, and\nthat makes it kind of take up,\n\n204\n00:10:46.869 --> 00:10:50.340\nthere's another inch out on that\nroom that I have available.\n\n205\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.870\nSo a lot of screen rules\nsteady takes up there.\n\n206\n00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.710\nSo If I just double click on it,\nit goes a way.\n\n207\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.510\nIf I double click back on it,\nit actually puts it back in too.\n\n208\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.300\nBut right underneath that ribbon\nessentially is what you see.\n\n209\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.310\nThis is where we begin to see\nthe differences that we might have\n\n210\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.390\nagainst something like Microsoft Word.\n\n211\n00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.440\nWe're not just given a sheet of paper\nnow .we're actually given rows and\n\n212\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.440\ncolumns, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.565\nAnd we're also given a tool in between.\n\n214\n00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:17.410\nSo this bar right here,\n\n215\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.520\nbeginning of where you see A1,\nlet me see if I can zoom in there for us.\n\n216\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.310\nSo A1 here, right here where you see that,\nthat is called a name box.\n\n217\n00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.760\nNow I'm hovering over it,\nit gives you a little tool tip.\n\n218\n00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.740\nAnd the reason why that name box\nis important is because it locates\n\n219\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.470\nthe square that you see right here, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.150\nSo notice that thicker black line,\n\n221\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.870\nthat's actually saying you're\nselecting that square.\n\n222\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.920\nLet me just go ahead and click right here\nand now notice that it changes to D2.\n\n223\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.380\nAnd we'll talk about\nthe naming convention too.\n\n224\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.050\n&gt;&gt; I see you have one box highlighted.\n\n225\n00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.460\nCan you highlight multiple\nboxes at the same time?\n\n226\n00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.320\nSay I wanted to put number three\nin ten different boxes at once,\n\n227\n00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.480\ncan you highlight them and do it that way?\n\n228\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.850\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you can actually just click and\ndrag, and now notice that you can do that.\n\n229\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.060\nNow at the very beginning,\n\n230\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.780\nyou'll notice that name box looks\na little bit strange where it says A3.\n\n231\n00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.730\nAnd that is because I clicked on\ncolumn A and number 3 to begin.\n\n232\n00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.660\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n233\n00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.120\n&gt;&gt; But if I click and drag,\nyou'll notice something else.\n\n234\n00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.205\nInstead goes to trying to count, so\n\n235\n00:12:15.205 --> 00:12:18.826\nit's actually doing what we\ncall a relative reference here.\n\n236\n00:12:18.826 --> 00:12:22.562\nWe're saying,\nyou're selecting one row, but\n\n237\n00:12:22.562 --> 00:12:28.500\nyou're selecting six columns, where\nyou see that 1R by 6C there in stead.\n\n238\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.002\nAnd then once I'm done, it actually just\ngoes ahead and says, this is where you\n\n239\n00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:35.313\nbegan the selection and that's what\nyou'll end up seeing there at times.\n\n240\n00:12:35.313 --> 00:12:36.200\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n241\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.495\n&gt;&gt; So that will always tell you\nthe position that you're in and\n\n242\n00:12:39.495 --> 00:12:43.490\nit'll also tell you some more advanced\ninformation as you start working with\n\n243\n00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.580\nmore and more complex things.\n\n244\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.440\nThe other thing that's actually right\nhere, this is divided into three parts.\n\n245\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.660\nYou probably see two parts, but it\nactually is divided into three parts here.\n\n246\n00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.785\nBut let's take a look at this third part.\n\n247\n00:12:56.785 --> 00:12:59.660\nYou'll notice that there's\na long gigantic cell up here,\n\n248\n00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.700\nand that is called your formula bar.\n\n249\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.930\nAny cell that we pick, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.910\nIf I start typing inside the cell.\n\n251\n00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.889\nSo there it is, I'm inside of G4.\n\n252\n00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:12.250\nI've double clicked on it,\nI get a double headed arrow here.\n\n253\n00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.040\nAnd I can put in my name, okay?\n\n254\n00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.750\nNow, notice what also happened\nup here in the formula bar\n\n255\n00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.290\nis that it also typed it in up here.\n\n256\n00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.490\nI can go to another one,\nso let's say H4 here.\n\n257\n00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:30.080\nThen I can also type in my last name,\neven up here on the formula bar.\n\n258\n00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.910\nSo it mirrors the selection that\nyou have up there in the bar.\n\n259\n00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.944\nThe reason why this is gonna be important\nlater on, as you add in more and\n\n260\n00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:43.586\nmore data and information, you might find\nout it's a little bit difficult to keep\n\n261\n00:13:43.586 --> 00:13:46.161\ntyping in this one cell and\nread everything.\n\n262\n00:13:46.161 --> 00:13:48.949\nBut notice across the very top, let me\nshow you what I'm talking about here.\n\n263\n00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:52.437\nSo now notice that if I look at G5,\nit looks terrible and\n\n264\n00:13:52.437 --> 00:13:54.227\nthere's nothing in there.\n\n265\n00:13:54.227 --> 00:13:58.458\nBut if I don't know if something is\nactually hidden in there or not,\n\n266\n00:13:58.458 --> 00:14:00.463\nI can simply click back on G4 and\n\n267\n00:14:00.463 --> 00:14:05.860\nall of the contents of that cell will be\nrevealed right here in the formula bar.\n\n268\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.740\nSo it really is helpful, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.330\nAnd we'll actually see that,\nrather than typing in gibberish,\n\n270\n00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.730\nwe're going to see it's going to be\na little more helpful later on, okay?\n\n271\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.310\nNow, the third part of it is\nright here in the center,\n\n272\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.750\nright where we see these buttons here,\nokay?\n\n273\n00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.970\nCancel, of course means, hey,\nI really don't wanna put that in the cell.\n\n274\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:28.440\nSo, in H4, if I wanted to type out, Wong,\nmy last name, I can actually come over\n\n275\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.340\nhere and select Cancel and that should\nnot actually, it actually did save it.\n\n276\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.910\nI was gonna say,\nit normally doesn't save it.\n\n277\n00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.050\nIt normally allows you to do that, but\n\n278\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.460\nI'm probably referring to\na formula more than anything else.\n\n279\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.780\nThe other one here, it actually normally\ndoes enter which means go ahead and\n\n280\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.760\nshift to the next column or\nshift to the next cell when you see this.\n\n281\n00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.310\nBut, actually, that just worked plain out.\n\n282\n00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.300\nSo, I was expecting it\nto just cancel it out,\n\n283\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.080\nbut it apparently doesn't\ncancel it out anymore.\n\n284\n00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.620\nIt used to,\n\n285\n00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.800\nwhere you'd just kind of delete everything\nin that cell that you just typed in.\n\n286\n00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.248\nSo, here, you're actually seeing\nsome different things go on.\n\n287\n00:15:00.248 --> 00:15:03.860\nAnd there's one other button that we\nwanna point out, which is right here.\n\n288\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.030\nAnd that is called the Insert Function,\nokay?\n\n289\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.313\nThat bottom is actually gonna\nbecome very important as you\n\n290\n00:15:10.313 --> 00:15:13.285\nget a little bit more\nadvanced into formulas.\n\n291\n00:15:13.285 --> 00:15:17.110\nYou're gonna see that Excel\nhas over 200 different\n\n292\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:22.120\nfunctions categorized across\nmultiple categories, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.450\nFinancial all the way\ndown to Compatibility,\n\n294\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.830\nwhich I don't know what that means,\nEngineering, Informational,\n\n295\n00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.150\nDatabase types, Statistical,\nMath &amp; Trig, Time, you name it.\n\n296\n00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.970\nIt has a ton of different functions.\n\n297\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:38.240\nAnd each one will be a little bit\ndifferent as you select one over another.\n\n298\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.690\nSo there's Statistical,\nhere's Math &amp; Trig.\n\n299\n00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.540\nYou'll see some different ones\nthat are available to you.\n\n300\n00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.990\nAnd once you learn about formulas and\nyou start learning what you have to do,\n\n301\n00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.510\nthose will become very\nimportant to you as well, okay?\n\n302\n00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember learning some of those\nlooking at project management training.\n\n303\n00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:57.447\nSo depending on the different\nindustry you're working with,\n\n304\n00:15:57.447 --> 00:16:00.742\nthere will be some formulas that you see\nMore often than others, so that's a quick\n\n305\n00:16:00.742 --> 00:16:04.230\nlittle shortcut there instead of having\nto manually input every single one.\n\n306\n00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.110\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n307\n00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.520\nSo you do have a lot of information\n\n308\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.700\nthat will help you out right\nthere at the very top.\n\n309\n00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.490\nNow, I want to make sure that we\nunderstand this aspect of it too.\n\n310\n00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.310\nSo let me go back and repeat something.\n\n311\n00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.950\nAll columns are referenced by what you\nsee you right up here in this top row.\n\n312\n00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.040\nAnd they are normally\nreferenced by a letter.\n\n313\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.950\nAnd usually it doesn't matter whether it's\ncapital or lower case if you type it in.\n\n314\n00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.640\nIt is normally gonna be here.\n\n315\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.060\nSo it's not case sensitive, they just\nshow it as being a capital letter.\n\n316\n00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:42.140\nEvery row though is actually going\nto be- have a number header too.\n\n317\n00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.120\nNow, we don't normally have to refer\nto them, but it is the intersection of\n\n318\n00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:51.940\na column and a row that gives us\nwhat we call the name of that cell.\n\n319\n00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.540\nOkay?\n\n320\n00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.820\nSo, that is really helpful because that\nis actually a reference to a location\n\n321\n00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.370\nJust like you learned about\nin math at some point.\n\n322\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:16:59.985\n&gt;&gt; Coordinates.\n\n323\n00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is a coordinate plane.\n\n324\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.930\nYou're actually seeing\nthat very same idea here.\n\n325\n00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.230\n&gt;&gt; So does that mean we are going\nto be limited by 26 columns if\n\n326\n00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.120\nwe're using the alphabet\nas our scheme here?\n\n327\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.080\n&gt;&gt; Well I would love to say yes,\n\n328\n00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.500\nthat would be absolutely\nsomething that would be great.\n\n329\n00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.905\nBut you're not, okay?\n\n330\n00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:20.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so the reason, why is that?\n\n331\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.490\nThe math programs and everything else, but\nespecially Excel because it's crunching\n\n332\n00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.620\nnumbers, it wants to give you as\nmany columns as they possibly can.\n\n333\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.530\nAnd it's limited really by the computing\nlanguage that was actually out there at\n\n334\n00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.940\nthe very beginning.\n\n335\n00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.560\nSo what they did is at the very beginning,\nthey gave\n\n336\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.330\nyou 256 columns that you\ncould actually end up having.\n\n337\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.860\nAnd that's because that's\nthe way that binary works.\n\n338\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.000\nYou don't have to learn all about binary,\nbut\n\n339\n00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.070\nthat was kind of the computational\nlimitation at the very beginning,\n\n340\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.720\nokay, of the way that the computer\ncould maximize something.\n\n341\n00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:01.090\nSo when you did that, it actually went\nto column xi is what it actually did.\n\n342\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that,\n\n343\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:03.650\nux or something.\n\n344\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:09.090\nBut today, let me show you something else\nhere, if I can actually make this work.\n\n345\n00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.370\nOops no,\nthat's not the way I make that work.\n\n346\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.590\nSo here what I need to do\nis see if I can get this to\n\n347\n00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.626\ndo what I want it,\nooh I can't make it move.\n\n348\n00:18:18.626 --> 00:18:20.141\nWhere's my key?\n\n349\n00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:24.020\nOkay, now if I keep going\nall the way out okay?\n\n350\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.660\nNotice that I'm actually just\nusing the arrow key and look,\n\n351\n00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.041\nI'm at Z or DC and I keep going out,\nall the way over to the end.\n\n352\n00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:33.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] More than enough.\n\n353\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.480\n&gt;&gt; This doesn't actually stop until\nyou get to UFD, if I remember right.\n\n354\n00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.610\nOr XFD, I think,\nmaybe I'm doing a little bit too much.\n\n355\n00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.810\nYep, too far out there.\n\n356\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.300\nSo it actually goes into three\ndifferent columns all the way over\n\n357\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.480\nto the right hand side.\n\n358\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.540\nAnd for some reason my keyboard shortcuts\nare just not really working the way that\n\n359\n00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:00.060\nI'd like them to work here to be able\nto make me zoom all the way out.\n\n360\n00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's definitely more\nthan I usually wanna work with.\n\n361\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n362\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.710\nthe way it extends out is at 16,000\ncolumns is what you have access to.\n\n363\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.770\nSo it's a ton, is what you end up doing.\n\n364\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:17.350\nNow, there's over a million rows though,\nthat you also have access to as well.\n\n365\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.900\nSo we again, let me see.\n\n366\n00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.440\nNo, I can't seem to,\nI know what happens here.\n\n367\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.970\nIt's because of the machine\nthat I'm working with and\n\n368\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.330\nthe Mac keyboard that I'm working with.\n\n369\n00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.207\nBut as you continue to go down, these\nnumbers will continue to increase and\n\n370\n00:19:31.207 --> 00:19:34.666\nit's over a million rows,\nyou start multiplying that together.\n\n371\n00:19:34.666 --> 00:19:38.611\nIt's very difficult for you to reach\nthe limits of a single excel worksheet\n\n372\n00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:41.220\nwhich is normally inside a workbook.\n\n373\n00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.320\nSo, I said that we would actually discuss\nthe difference between a worksheet and\n\n374\n00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.040\nworkbook, the workbook is\nactually the file name itself And\n\n375\n00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.660\ninside of that file you can\nactually have multiple work sheets.\n\n376\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.980\nAnd by default there's\nactually three of them,\n\n377\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.530\nand you can change that later on\nas you learn more about Excel.\n\n378\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.498\nBut it actually gives you\nthree different sheets.\n\n379\n00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:01.730\nYou want to add a new one you\nsimply just click here and\n\n380\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.260\nthat adds another sheet for you.\n\n381\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.290\nIf you want to keep things that are\nseparate and tracking them separately too.\n\n382\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.550\nThat looks pretty convenient to go ahead\nand keep similar concepts or ideas within\n\n383\n00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.970\none work group, so I don't have to open\nand close and have multiple files open.\n\n384\n00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.870\nI can just have that one\nparticular work book open and\n\n385\n00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.730\nkeep switching between\nthe ones that I have open.\n\n386\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that\nit actually works that way.\n\n387\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.680\nI'm getting a little kind of fight\nback with my machine here as I try and\n\n388\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.140\ndo some different shortcuts\nthat are available to us.\n\n389\n00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.990\nNow, we want to talk\nabout shortcuts as well.\n\n390\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.220\nNavigation and\nshortcuts are fairly key for us.\n\n391\n00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.830\nAnd so there's a lot of things that you\ncan do simply using the arrow keys as kind\n\n392\n00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.010\nof some of the ones that\nyou have available.\n\n393\n00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.080\nAnd that's kind of one of the ones\nthat I tend to use fairly often.\n\n394\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.180\n&gt;&gt; So, Rodney, if we look at the way those\ncolumns are labelled with the alphabetical\n\n395\n00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.910\nscheme there,\n\n396\n00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.060\ndoes that mean we're limited to 26\n&gt;&gt; Columns.\n\n397\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, you would think so, but\n\n398\n00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.650\nthe very fact is that there is actually\nmore columns that we can actually get to.\n\n399\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.870\nLet me show you what we're actually again.\n\n400\n00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.110\nSo remember that if we take a look\nat the alphabets that we have here,\n\n401\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.710\nwhat Cherokee is referring to of course,\n\n402\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:08.040\nis there's only 26 letters in\nthe English alphabet as far as we know.\n\n403\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.240\nSo there is ADC and\nyou would think hey, that's it.\n\n404\n00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.590\n&gt;&gt; But if I continue to hold my right\narrow down, notice Cherokee it actually\n\n405\n00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.140\nbegins at AA and\nit used to go 256 columns out.\n\n406\n00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.270\nWhich if I remember it was like X-I or\nX-U or something like that.\n\n407\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:29.520\nBut today, because of the advancement\nof the way that computing worked, and\n\n408\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.230\nthere was a limitation\nback in the early days.\n\n409\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:37.700\nWe limited you to 256 columns, well\nnow they've extended it out and so now\n\n410\n00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.990\nI'm gonna talk about a shortcut since we\nhad mentioned them a little bit earlier.\n\n411\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.930\nIf I hold my control key\ndown on my keyboard and\n\n412\n00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:48.940\nthe right arrow,\nit extends all the way out to XFD.\n\n413\n00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.670\nOkay?\n\n414\n00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.460\nNow that's three letters.\n\n415\n00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.020\nSo you go through AAA and\nthen you go to BBB and\n\n416\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.060\nthen you continue to go all the way out.\n\n417\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:56.890\n&gt;&gt; Double A, triple A yep.\n\n418\n00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.710\n&gt;&gt; And then X and then you start\ndoing that so you go XA, XB,\n\n419\n00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:05.400\nXC you know you go through all that\nXFD and you're probably wondering how.\n\n420\n00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.302\n&gt;&gt; I hope I never have to get to that.\n\n421\n00:22:07.302 --> 00:22:08.718\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How many actual\n\n422\n00:22:08.718 --> 00:22:10.970\ncolumns are there really out there?\n\n423\n00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.290\nWell right now at least\nas far as 2010 goes and\n\n424\n00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.150\nI think even in current version of it.\n\n425\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:21.958\nIt is like 16,000 actual columns,\nand it may be even 65,000 columns,\n\n426\n00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:25.660\nI think it's 16,000\nactual columns available.\n\n427\n00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.710\nNow just when you think that that's\nkind of eerie I'm gonna do a CTRL and\n\n428\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.980\na left arrow.\n\n429\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.390\nAnd what that will automatically do is\nbring me all the back to A1 as well.\n\n430\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.210\nSo quick navigation.\n\n431\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.460\nSo Cherokee how many rows do you\nthink are available as well?\n\n432\n00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.930\nAnd I'm a tell you it's longer than 23,\n\n433\n00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.765\nwhich is what we see down here\non the edge of my screen.\n\n434\n00:22:44.765 --> 00:22:47.174\n&gt;&gt; Alright, if I had to guess,\nI'm going to go with the same number for\n\n435\n00:22:47.174 --> 00:22:48.716\ncolumns to make a perfect square, maybe.\n\n436\n00:22:48.716 --> 00:22:49.537\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n437\n00:22:49.537 --> 00:22:50.158\n&gt;&gt; Maybe 16,000.\n\n438\n00:22:50.158 --> 00:22:54.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah 16,000 that would be cool\nright if that were the case.\n\n439\n00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.550\nBut you'd be sadly wrong.\n\n440\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.738\nIs what it would be.\n\n441\n00:22:57.738 --> 00:23:00.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm used to that.\n\n442\n00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.450\n&gt;&gt; So, let me do this this way.\n\n443\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.580\nSo let's show you another\nway that we can navigate.\n\n444\n00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:09.570\nI'm gonna zoom in here and\nI can actually type that in.\n\n445\n00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.040\nLet's say we're gonna go to A16384.\n\n446\n00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.930\nthat's a lot of rows, right?\n\n447\n00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.440\nSo that should put me down or\n\n448\n00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.858\nthe cell reference of A 16,384 if\nI actually typed that in right.\n\n449\n00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:26.470\nAnd I do that, and so there it is.\n\n450\n00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:32.460\nIf I zoom out and\nnow If I use my down arrow-- now\n\n451\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.110\nIf I go back up here, I'm just going to\nshow you another short-cut here, right...\n\n452\n00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Since I'm at A, up here.\n\n453\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.340\nI'm going to do a control and\na down arrow, it is a million\n\n454\n00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:48.590\nforty eight thousand five hundred and\nseventy six rows...\n\n455\n00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.580\n&gt;&gt; And you know what?\n\n456\n00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.644\nThat's all for you, Rodney, I'll let you\ngo ahead and input that much information.\n\n457\n00:23:53.644 --> 00:23:55.654\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot of information, right?\n\n458\n00:23:55.654 --> 00:23:59.268\nAnd that is because they found out\nsomething over the years, right,\n\n459\n00:23:59.268 --> 00:24:03.131\nthat people needed more computational\npower Than what we had in the 256\n\n460\n00:24:03.131 --> 00:24:08.000\ncolumns and 16,000 rows or\n65,000 rows, whatever I said before.\n\n461\n00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.880\nNo, backwards.\n\n462\n00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.810\nWhatever that was.\n\n463\n00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:14.240\nNo, yeah, the original one was 65,000\nrows and then the 256 columns.\n\n464\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.110\nThat gave you something about 4.2 billion,\nor something like that, actual cells.\n\n465\n00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.655\nThere's more than that, today, okay.\n\n466\n00:24:19.655 --> 00:24:23.860\nSo you can actually have up to 255 sheets.\n\n467\n00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.159\nSo if you do all that-\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n\n468\n00:24:25.159 --> 00:24:25.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what\n\n469\n00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.610\ncould end up happening as well.\n\n470\n00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.080\nBut most of us are not gonna do that.\n\n471\n00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.120\nCan you hit that limit?\n\n472\n00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:30.650\nYes.\n\n473\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.190\nYou can definitely hit that limit.\n\n474\n00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.920\nBut just kinda realize,\nmost of us are probably not gonna do that.\n\n475\n00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.300\n&gt;&gt; And just to make sure I understand,\n\n476\n00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.850\nwhen you said sheets,\nwe're not talking about the actual file.\n\n477\n00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.710\nWe're talking about our\nindividual worksheets.\n\n478\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.600\n&gt;&gt; Right, just like we added in\nthat worksheet number four earlier,\n\n479\n00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.910\nif I keep clicking on this I\ncan go up to 255 sheets too.\n\n480\n00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n481\n00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.370\n&gt;&gt; So because of the computational\npower that you have available here\n\n482\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.770\nyou can multiply across sheets,\nyou can do a bunch of different things.\n\n483\n00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.700\nFormulas you name it,\nthere is a ton of them.\n\n484\n00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.621\nBut by simply learning just a few\nshortcuts, along with the ones that we've\n\n485\n00:25:02.621 --> 00:25:06.481\ndiscussed earlier in the navigational\nshow where we showed you kind of just\n\n486\n00:25:06.481 --> 00:25:09.851\nthe general ones that can be used\nacross all the interfaces here,\n\n487\n00:25:09.851 --> 00:25:13.179\nyou can have a very powerful and\nwork very quickly in-between.\n\n488\n00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:14.947\nAlong with the name box here,\n\n489\n00:25:14.947 --> 00:25:18.554\nyou can navigate to any cell in\nthat worksheet very easily and\n\n490\n00:25:18.554 --> 00:25:22.870\nvery quickly if you actually know\nwhat the reference is as well.\n\n491\n00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.760\nSo there are multiple ways of navigation.\n\n492\n00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.382\nI always like using the arrows myself.\n\n493\n00:25:26.382 --> 00:25:29.238\n&gt;&gt; I know, it kind of feels like you're\nplaying a game, or like Battleship.\n\n494\n00:25:29.238 --> 00:25:30.488\nN13.\n\n495\n00:25:30.488 --> 00:25:31.131\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n496\n00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:32.059\nYeah, it does.\n\n497\n00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:33.337\nWhen you start doing stuff like that.\n\n498\n00:25:33.337 --> 00:25:37.282\nSo just kind of realize that there\nis a lot of information, okay.\n\n499\n00:25:37.282 --> 00:25:40.620\nNow there's a couple of other things that\nwe need to do, but at least we're starting\n\n500\n00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.480\na little bit here to get into\nworking with Excel on the power.\n\n501\n00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.700\nBut those are kinda the basic navigations.\n\n502\n00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.470\nYou can always, of course,\nzoom in and zoom out,\n\n503\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.570\nlet me show you that in the lower\nright-hand corner of Excel here, okay.\n\n504\n00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:58.600\nSo the same features that we saw earlier\nin Word when we saw the Office Suite\n\n505\n00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.510\nintroduction there where\nwe kinda viewed everything.\n\n506\n00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.170\nYou still have these little ways\nof displaying the pages and\n\n507\n00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:08.700\nthen the zoom feature, that will allow you\nto toggle it back and forth, as well as be\n\n508\n00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:14.550\nable to move across the sheet using\nthis kind of zoom bar, or scroll bar.\n\n509\n00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.066\nI keep calling it a zoom bar.\n\n510\n00:26:16.066 --> 00:26:17.070\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You've got your zoom bar down\n\n511\n00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.603\nin the bottom corner.\n\n512\n00:26:17.603 --> 00:26:18.283\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n513\n00:26:18.283 --> 00:26:20.439\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was saying is I kind of\n\n514\n00:26:20.439 --> 00:26:22.340\nkeep saying it backward there.\n\n515\n00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.280\nBut you do have those\nadditional features for you.\n\n516\n00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.880\nOn a small screen, it's gonna be,\nof course, better for\n\n517\n00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.790\nyou to use that zoom feature\nthan on a large screen.\n\n518\n00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.100\nUnless you have an insanely\nhigh resolution,\n\n519\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.910\nthen you might want to\nzoom in on that too.\n\n520\n00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.960\nThe other thing that I wanna remind you of\nis that the deeper your resolution is on\n\n521\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.140\nyour screen,\nmost screens today might be 21\", 24\",\n\n522\n00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.470\nyou'll see a lot more columns than what\nyou'll see right here on my screen.\n\n523\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.870\nSo if you're going,\nwhy does Ronnie's only show T?\n\n524\n00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.200\nI'm looking on mine and\nit shows X, A, B, or something.\n\n525\n00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.250\nHopefully it's not that wide.\n\n526\n00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.920\nBut it can show something like that.\n\n527\n00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.350\nBut you kind of might see that you\nhave a lot more available to you.\n\n528\n00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.830\n&gt;&gt; And not to forget that we also\nhave the option we see quite often.\n\n529\n00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.710\nDual monitors, or even multiple monitors,\n\n530\n00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.810\nin a regular work\nenvironment in these times.\n\n531\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is very true that you'll\nprobably more likely see the idea of\n\n532\n00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.190\ndual monitors.\n\n533\n00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.790\nI haven't tried it.\n\n534\n00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.210\nI haven't tried to stretch one Excel\nworkbook over two monitors, or not.\n\n535\n00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.690\nBut that's actually interesting,\nI may try that later on, if I can do that.\n\n536\n00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.570\nI don't know if I can or not.\n\n537\n00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.270\nThat's actually kind of a neat\nquestion to think about.\n\n538\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.060\nSo we wanna get into working then.\n\n539\n00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.420\nWhat do we have to do inside of Excel,\nokay?\n\n540\n00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.700\nWell the first thing, of course,\nis just doing data entry.\n\n541\n00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.010\nSo let's just show you some\nof the options here for\n\n542\n00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.070\nthe idea of data entry which we've\nalready just kind of mentioned.\n\n543\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.860\nYou select any cell that you want to,\n\n544\n00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:41.270\nand that's gonna give you the selection\nright here, that's available.\n\n545\n00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.440\nAnd if you wanna stat entering data,\n\n546\n00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.715\nthe way that you can verify that you're\nready for data entry is in the lower\n\n547\n00:27:47.715 --> 00:27:52.180\nleft-hand corner notice it says\nReady at this point, okay.\n\n548\n00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.330\nNow what that means is that that\ncell is now ready for data.\n\n549\n00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.210\nAs soon as I select it,\nI don't have to double-click or\n\n550\n00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.210\nanything, I can,\nI can just start typing, okay.\n\n551\n00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:04.514\nSo we can do something like that very\neasily, and once I do this, so let me just\n\n552\n00:28:04.514 --> 00:28:08.645\ngo ahead and type in the word enter\ninstead of just making scribbly marks.\n\n553\n00:28:08.645 --> 00:28:12.707\nAnd I press Enter, okay,\nit actually brings me back down and\n\n554\n00:28:12.707 --> 00:28:16.544\nnotice that it says hey,\nI'm ready for more data entry.\n\n555\n00:28:16.544 --> 00:28:24.370\nIf I double-click back on cell C2,\nnow you'll notice that this changes, okay.\n\n556\n00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.707\nAnd it now says Edit, and\n\n557\n00:28:25.707 --> 00:28:29.215\nthat means you are about to change\nsomething inside of that cell.\n\n558\n00:28:29.215 --> 00:28:33.220\nAnd that's something that's very important\ncuz you may wanna do it and you may not.\n\n559\n00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.200\nNow when you're just typing in words,\nit really doesn't matter.\n\n560\n00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.750\nWhere this actually counts is gonna\nbe when you work with formulas,\n\n561\n00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.360\nis when it actually counts.\n\n562\n00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.930\nCuz you can mess up a formula very\nquickly if you're in this Edit mode and\n\n563\n00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.040\nyou're not even looking at it.\n\n564\n00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.763\nAnd all of a sudden you just start, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Good to know, yeah, thanks.\n\n565\n00:28:48.763 --> 00:28:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it will break a formula.\n\n566\n00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.590\nNow, you might be going what's\nthe big deal about breaking a formula?\n\n567\n00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:56.950\nWell it depends on how many cells are in\nthat formula that your referencing.\n\n568\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.121\n&gt;&gt; Could you imagine, though, giving\nthe wrong calculations to your boss and\n\n569\n00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:01.530\nthen completely messing up the budget, so\n\n570\n00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.900\nI could see how could\nit be very detrimental.\n\n571\n00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.150\n&gt;&gt; I don't have to imagine it.\n\n572\n00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.182\nLet's put it that way.\n\n573\n00:29:06.182 --> 00:29:06.989\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\n\n574\n00:29:06.989 --> 00:29:08.272\nI won't ask anymore questions.\n\n575\n00:29:08.272 --> 00:29:09.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right.\n\n576\n00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.223\nYeah, yeah, and\nsometimes you don't have to imagine it,\n\n577\n00:29:11.223 --> 00:29:12.770\nyou've actually done it before.\n\n578\n00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:16.870\nAnd the only thing that was a saving grace\nat that point, right, was that ability for\n\n579\n00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:21.320\nme to go I'm glad I saved my work\njust a couple of minutes before.\n\n580\n00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.000\nAnd then I simply went ahead and\nclosed out the entire document and\n\n581\n00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.020\ndidn't save any of the additional changes.\n\n582\n00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.690\nSo I didn't actually end\nup doing that to a formula.\n\n583\n00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.280\n&gt;&gt; So over the years, Ronnie,\nI have noticed working in\n\n584\n00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.080\nolder applications you would have\nto manually save every single time.\n\n585\n00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.510\nWhat is up with this autosave?\n\n586\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.510\nI've noticed now if I'm typing emails and\nso\n\n587\n00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.190\nforth, it will say this\ndocument has been autosaved.\n\n588\n00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.794\nShould I kinda rely on that in Excel,\nor stick with your-\n\n589\n00:29:45.794 --> 00:29:46.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n590\n00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Stick with your save and\n\n591\n00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.140\nsave as features.\n\n592\n00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.608\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthe autosave can help you at times, but\n\n593\n00:29:51.608 --> 00:29:54.662\nit is something that you should\nmanually go ahead and do.\n\n594\n00:29:54.662 --> 00:29:57.409\nAnd the reason why is\nexactly what you said here,\n\n595\n00:29:57.409 --> 00:30:02.730\nthat sometimes document behavior doesn't\nalways, it's not always consistent.\n\n596\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:07.360\nSo even though you might go, I don't worry\nabout it cuz I autosaved and you go it's\n\n597\n00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.940\nworked nine times, the last nine times\nthat I tried this and then you go\n\n598\n00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.210\nwatch this, watch what I do, I'm not even\ngoing to save it and you close it out.\n\n599\n00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.520\nYou go and open it again and\nwhat do you find out it's like,\n\n600\n00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.860\nthat didn't pop back up\nthe way that I thought it was.\n\n601\n00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.300\nAnd now you're looking and\n\n602\n00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.570\nyou're scrambling around like,\nwhat happened at that point?\n\n603\n00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.880\n&gt;&gt; Do I have a copy of my resume on file?\n\n604\n00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n605\n00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:31.270\nhopefully you do, but\nyou can kind of see stuff like that.\n\n606\n00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.860\nSo it's always better for\nyou to manually and\n\n607\n00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:38.010\nmentally say I'm gonna save this is\nwhat you want to be able to do, okay.\n\n608\n00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:42.670\nSo along with something like this,\nright, okay, there are a few things that\n\n609\n00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.830\nhelp us to make this a little bit\nquicker in terms of data entry and\n\n610\n00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.490\nto actually be able to do a few things.\n\n611\n00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.240\nSo we wanna make sure that you at\nleast see some of those things,\n\n612\n00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.950\ncuz these are actually kind of\nthe neat things that help you out.\n\n613\n00:30:54.950 --> 00:31:00.230\nSo let's take, for an example,\nthat we're gonna create a worksheet that\n\n614\n00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.440\ninvolves days of the week if we want to,\nokay.\n\n615\n00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.732\nSo Cherokee, I'm gonna say, you know\nwhat the days of the week are and so-\n\n616\n00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:08.685\n&gt;&gt; I do in English, but\n\n617\n00:31:08.685 --> 00:31:10.885\nI mean are we doing\na different language here?\n\n618\n00:31:10.885 --> 00:31:12.218\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, yeah, yeah.\n\n619\n00:31:12.218 --> 00:31:13.930\nAll Right, so Cherokee, help me out.\n\n620\n00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:14.640\n&gt;&gt; Monday.\n\n621\n00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.422\n&gt;&gt; Monday.\n\n622\n00:31:15.422 --> 00:31:16.819\n&gt;&gt; My favorite.\n\n623\n00:31:16.819 --> 00:31:17.946\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n624\n00:31:17.946 --> 00:31:19.310\n&gt;&gt; Are we staring on Monday?\n\n625\n00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n626\n00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:20.630\n&gt;&gt; What's the next one?\n\n627\n00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:21.250\n&gt;&gt; Tuesday [LAUGH].\n\n628\n00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.650\n&gt;&gt; Tuesday, okay, all right.\n\n629\n00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.360\nCherokee, I'm already tired of this.\n\n630\n00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.030\nI'm already tired of typing this.\n\n631\n00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:31.230\nI need every day of the work week\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I'm tired of telling you\n\n632\n00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.678\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I don't blame you, okay.\n\n633\n00:31:32.678 --> 00:31:36.638\nSo you're already tired and\nI'm tired as well.\n\n634\n00:31:36.638 --> 00:31:40.239\nExcel has some built in productivity\nthings that really help us out, okay, and\n\n635\n00:31:40.239 --> 00:31:44.166\nthat's because we've already established\na pattern that Excel knows about, okay,\n\n636\n00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:46.180\nwhich are the days of the week.\n\n637\n00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.150\nNow the way that I can take advantage of\nthat, let me zoom in so you can see this,\n\n638\n00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.470\nis that I can select on that one cell, and\nnotice that there's something a little bit\n\n639\n00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:58.530\ndifferent here at this corner right here,\nyou see that little square?\n\n640\n00:31:58.530 --> 00:31:59.667\nThat black square right\nthere in the corner?\n\n641\n00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.182\n&gt;&gt; It's tiny, but yes.\n\n642\n00:32:01.182 --> 00:32:01.725\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nAnd\n\n643\n00:32:01.725 --> 00:32:05.416\nthen when you hover your mouse over it\nnotice that the cursor turns different.\n\n644\n00:32:05.416 --> 00:32:09.649\nSo yeah, it turns into instead\nof this kinda unusual white,\n\n645\n00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:11.560\nfairly fat plus sign here.\n\n646\n00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.960\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It loses its center.\n\n647\n00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n648\n00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:19.170\nnow notice that it actually looks like\na crosshair when I hover over that.\n\n649\n00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.820\nSo, if I wanted to, I can click,\nand then I can drag.\n\n650\n00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.750\nLook, it starts saying Tuesday.\n\n651\n00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.317\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n652\n00:32:27.317 --> 00:32:28.677\n&gt;&gt; How clever.\n\n653\n00:32:28.677 --> 00:32:31.227\n&gt;&gt; And then I let go.\n&gt;&gt; Is it safe to assume that they have\n\n654\n00:32:31.227 --> 00:32:34.040\nmonths and\nother types of patterns as well?\n\n655\n00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a good question,\nso we can try that out as well.\n\n656\n00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:41.230\nSo let's say-\n&gt;&gt; January.\n\n657\n00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.730\n&gt;&gt; January?\n\n658\n00:32:42.892 --> 00:32:44.968\nAll right, I'm really tired,\nso let's forget that.\n\n659\n00:32:44.968 --> 00:32:46.873\nOkay, so I can select that.\n\n660\n00:32:46.873 --> 00:32:48.777\nAnd then, let's see.\n\n661\n00:32:50.738 --> 00:32:52.400\nI can go all the way to, where's December?\n\n662\n00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.123\n&gt;&gt; Create a graph, cool.\n\n663\n00:32:53.123 --> 00:32:54.450\n&gt;&gt; There you go, look at that.\n\n664\n00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.780\nSo, now I have all\nthe way through December.\n\n665\n00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.600\nNow, it can also learn patterns too, okay?\n\n666\n00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.350\nSo, let's say that we wanted to\nstart off here with other things.\n\n667\n00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:07.373\nSo this makes no sense at all,\nbut let's say this.\n\n668\n00:33:07.373 --> 00:33:11.950\nI wanted to actually do even numbers,\nokay?\n\n669\n00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:15.050\nIf I can give it a series\nthat it can learn,\n\n670\n00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:16.730\nExcel is smart enough to learn that.\n\n671\n00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:21.860\nI just simply select both, and\nnow I say hey, can you learn this?\n\n672\n00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.692\nNotice now there's all my even numbers.\n\n673\n00:33:24.692 --> 00:33:28.185\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I need one of these for\ntaking the Mensa exam.\n\n674\n00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:29.094\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Mensa exam?\n\n675\n00:33:29.094 --> 00:33:31.818\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have not ever looked into that, and\n\n676\n00:33:31.818 --> 00:33:34.426\nthe reason why is because I've\nnever even thought about it.\n\n677\n00:33:34.426 --> 00:33:36.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, apparently Cherokee has.\n\n678\n00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.550\nSo that must be neat.\n\n679\n00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.170\nSo there you go.\nSo\n\n680\n00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.890\nyou have odd and even numbers that\nyou can actually end up doing.\n\n681\n00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.480\nThe other thing that it also notices\nis it not only follows a pattern,\n\n682\n00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.360\nit knows certain patterns too.\n\n683\n00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.590\nSo, what's the standard abbreviation for\nquarters?\n\n684\n00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.980\nQ1, Q2, something like that?\n\n685\n00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.373\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you mean budgeting wise?\n\n686\n00:33:55.373 --> 00:33:56.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The calendar?\n\n687\n00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:57.190\nOkay, yeah.\n\n688\n00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:59.780\n&gt;&gt; So, let's do something like Q1, right?\n\n689\n00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.130\nYou and I know that, as far as a year\ngoes, there's only four quarters, right?\n\n690\n00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:04.610\n&gt;&gt; I hope so.\n&gt;&gt; But yet, Q1,\n\n691\n00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.110\nit doesn't sound like it's\na standard kind of pattern.\n\n692\n00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:11.400\nIt might go from Q1 all\nthe way through Q65,533.\n\n693\n00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n694\n00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.570\n&gt;&gt; But, because it is\na pattern that it recognizes,\n\n695\n00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.010\nwhat do you think happens after Q1?\n\n696\n00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.580\nOr Q4, excuse me, sorry.\n\n697\n00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.175\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n698\n00:34:22.175 --> 00:34:23.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n699\n00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.647\n&gt;&gt; Year two Q1, or either Q5?\n\n700\n00:34:24.647 --> 00:34:26.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, notice that it starts all over.\n\n701\n00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.451\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n&gt;&gt; See, so\n\n702\n00:34:27.451 --> 00:34:30.696\nit actually knows that, hey,\nwhen you're doing something like this,\n\n703\n00:34:30.696 --> 00:34:33.560\nyou're more then likely\ntalking about quarters.\n\n704\n00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.210\nAnd it can automatically do that.\n\n705\n00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.275\nSo, this is something\nthat we call Autofill.\n\n706\n00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:38.650\n[CROSSTALK] What it's called.\n&gt;&gt; Mind blown.\n\n707\n00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:39.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n708\n00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.450\n&gt;&gt; So, it's a fairly simple technique.\n\n709\n00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:45.130\nBut the idea of Autofill\nhelped you in productivity,\n\n710\n00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.694\nwhen you need to actually create\nsomething in data entry very quickly.\n\n711\n00:34:48.694 --> 00:34:49.356\n&gt;&gt; And I will, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n712\n00:34:49.356 --> 00:34:53.497\nyeah we're actually gonna see more when\nwe start creating a little bit of data\n\n713\n00:34:53.497 --> 00:34:57.588\nin the spreadsheet, to also take a look,\nof course, about taking charts.\n\n714\n00:34:57.588 --> 00:34:59.645\nBut Cherokee,\nI think I've talked a little bit too long.\n\n715\n00:34:59.645 --> 00:35:02.030\n&gt;&gt; Allright, well we'll go head and\nwrap up for this episode.\n\n716\n00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.220\nBut I'm excited to see what other kind\nof tricks you have coming our way.\n\n717\n00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.529\nSo, thank you for being here today, and\nthank you guys so much for tuning in.\n\n718\n00:35:08.529 --> 00:35:09.420\nBut don't go anywhere.\n\n719\n00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.164\nAs you can see, we have a lot\nof really cool tips coming up.\n\n720\n00:35:12.164 --> 00:35:15.050\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n721\n00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.830\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n722\n00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:17.890\n&gt;&gt; And, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n723\n00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.251\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n724\n00:35:20.251

Well, thank you for\n\n10\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.890\nhaving me back as we continue on with the\nMicrosoft Office Productivity Suite here\n\n11\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.830\nof applications.\n\n12\n00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.840\nAnd specifically gonna be diving\ninto PowerPoint because, well, one,\n\n13\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.290\nit's actually part of the program.\n\n14\n00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.200\nBut two, it's something that you may\nreally end up having to work with\n\n15\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.430\nmore often than you think.\n\n16\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.170\nAnd the reason why is because\nPowerPoint is a powerful\n\n17\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.360\npresentation type of software.\n\n18\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.630\nThat allows to make slides, and be able\ntop make the point that you need to\n\n19\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.990\nmake when you're all having\nsome type of meeting.\n\n20\n00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.190\nAnd even if you're not the one\ndoing the presentation,\n\n21\n00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.920\nit could be that you're the one actually\nbuilding that presentation slideshow\n\n22\n00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.250\nto make everything work and\nhappen the way that you need to.\n\n23\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.246\nAnd it's one of the more important things\nthat a lot of people, I don't think,\n\n24\n00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:10.841\nis important.\n\n25\n00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:14.726\nBut it is important,\nbecause you can either make your boss look\n\n26\n00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:18.977\nbad [LAUGH] by doing a pretty poor\nPowerPoint, or you can make your boss\n\n27\n00:01:18.977 --> 00:01:23.593\nlook like an incredible genius by\nactually coming up with just a decent, or\n\n28\n00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:28.623\na very powerful way to make the point, and\nto emphasize exactly what you want to.\n\n29\n00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:30.331\nBut we're just gonna show you and\n\n30\n00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:34.790\ntalk about the introduction to this\nprogram is where we're going to begin.\n\n31\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.910\nSo, let's dive on in, and\n\n32\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.820\ntake a look here at some of the different\nthings that we have, all right?\n\n33\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.850\nSo here on my machine, I've got\nPowerPoint installed into my machine.\n\n34\n00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.790\nWe're gonna create a PowerPoint\npresentation is what we're gonna do.\n\n35\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.070\nNow Cherokee, the products that we've\nalready taken a look at it in previous\n\n36\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.880\nepisodes, we've talked about Word,\nwe've talked about Excel so\n\n37\n00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.980\nfar, and they're really great programs.\n\n38\n00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.990\nBut it does kinda require a bit of\ncoaching to at least get started,\n\n39\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.330\nif you've never worked with it before.\n\n40\n00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.370\n&gt;&gt; To become proficient.\n\n41\n00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nto become a little bit proficient.\n\n42\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.400\nBut PowerPoint's a little bit different,\nlet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n43\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.340\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick on Start, and then All Programs.\n\n44\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.630\nAnd once again, it's gonna be located\ninside of the Microsoft Office folder.\n\n45\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.960\nIf this is the first time that\nyou've opened up your computer,\n\n46\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.140\nand you haven't used any of the Office\nProducts, it's gonna be right here.\n\n47\n00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.710\nAnd then, I'm gonna select\nMicrosoft PowerPoint 2010.\n\n48\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.990\nAnd when I do that,\nit's gonna launch the application.\n\n49\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.638\nAnd Cherokee,\nI'm not trying to say that it's helpful.\n\n50\n00:02:30.638 --> 00:02:32.569\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, overall though,\n\n51\n00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.707\nwhat do you think it wants\nus to do right away?\n\n52\n00:02:34.707 --> 00:02:37.412\n&gt;&gt; Add a title and a subtitle.\n\n53\n00:02:37.412 --> 00:02:38.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\n\n54\n00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.330\nif you wanna talk about a program\nthat really says, look-\n\n55\n00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.240\n&gt;&gt; This is what we're gonna talk about.\n\n56\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is what we're really going\nto do, you really don't need me for\n\n57\n00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.180\nmuch more on that.\n\n58\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.760\nSo, you're probably going, okay, Ronnie,\nso why are we having a show on it?\n\n59\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.369\nBecause it does matter on how\nyou create these presentations,\n\n60\n00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.964\nand what presentations\nend up looking like.\n\n61\n00:02:56.964 --> 00:03:01.886\nSo, I do advise you if you haven't\nworked with it, see there is a trial,\n\n62\n00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:07.800\nI think there may be a trial download\nthat you can use on Microsoft PowerPoint.\n\n63\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.785\nAnd just follow some of\nthe instructions it gives you.\n\n64\n00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:14.120\nIt's actually pretty neat,\nat least on this point here, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.010\nSo, you'll see, once again,\nthat if you take a look at\n\n66\n00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.930\nthe earlier up set that we walk through\nsome of the navigation features of Office,\n\n67\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.630\nit's still the same type of\nfeatures up here at the very top.\n\n68\n00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.005\nYou still have the same things\nwhere you have that ribbon and\n\n69\n00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.360\nthese different tabs, and\nthey're majority the same thing.\n\n70\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.105\nNotice that if you learned Word,\nthis now goes hey, I can do this.\n\n71\n00:03:34.105 --> 00:03:36.350\nThat looks exactly like\nwhat I saw in Word.\n\n72\n00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.112\nAnd you'll still see some\ntools that will pop up,\n\n73\n00:03:39.112 --> 00:03:42.420\nthat would be a little bit different, but\nyou'll be able to work with it right away.\n\n74\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.382\nAnd this one, like I said, I don't think\nyou get a better hint than what you see\n\n75\n00:03:46.382 --> 00:03:50.633\nright here, which is hey, you out there,\nthis is your first time opening it.\n\n76\n00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:51.987\nI'm gonna add a title.\n\n77\n00:03:51.987 --> 00:03:53.462\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\nget started by adding a title.\n\n78\n00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:56.200\n&gt;&gt; But look at what else it says,\nit says click to add the title,\n\n79\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.604\nit doesn't say add a title, so\nall I do is click, look at that, okay?\n\n80\n00:03:59.604 --> 00:04:02.438\nSo, we can actually add a title here.\n\n81\n00:04:02.438 --> 00:04:05.478\nNow, one of the best things to do\nif you're really trying this for\n\n82\n00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:09.185\nthe first time is think about something\nfun that you would want to present on most\n\n83\n00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:11.480\nof the time in business,\nit's not gonna be fun.\n\n84\n00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.190\nIt's gonna be first quarter-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.310\n&gt;&gt; Projected earnings based off of\n\n86\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.840\nprevious sales from the years 1997\nthrough 2004 in comparison to 2016,\n\n87\n00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.660\nor whatever it might be.\n\n88\n00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.320\nCrud, that's quite a title.\n\n89\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.300\n&gt;&gt; Yawn.\n&gt;&gt; Do something fun, yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.180\nYeah, start off with something fun,\nand that's what we're going to do.\n\n91\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.381\nWe are gonna build\na PowerPoint here together.\n\n92\n00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:36.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And Cherokee,\n\n93\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.569\nI've decided that we're gonna\nbuild a PowerPoint, and\n\n94\n00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.040\nwe're gonna actually find some magical\nelves, is what we're going to do.\n\n95\n00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.700\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n[LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.731\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n97\n00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:46.067\n&gt;&gt; It's always a surprise.\n\n98\n00:04:46.067 --> 00:04:49.989\n&gt;&gt; We're on the process of finding,\nit is the season,\n\n99\n00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:54.462\nit is the season,\nto actually interview people for elves.\n\n100\n00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:57.875\nWe got a selected group of candidates now,\nokay?\n\n101\n00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:02.449\nAnd so, now we want to actually do that,\nwe're going to actually say candidates.\n\n102\n00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.582\nIf I can spell it right for elf.\n\n103\n00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:07.580\n&gt;&gt; Position.\n\n104\n00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.246\n&gt;&gt; Elf or elves, or, yeah, elves.\n\n105\n00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:16.608\nElves?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n106\n00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:17.851\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do that, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:18.970\nSo, here it is.\n\n108\n00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.790\nNow, of course,\nthe subtitle here is important now.\n\n109\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.354\nFor us, this is gonna be ours,\nwe'll actually say from,\n\n110\n00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:30.130\nor by, we'll put Cherokee first.\n\n111\n00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.305\n&gt;&gt; Lovely.\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n112\n00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:35.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie Wong, how's that?\n\n113\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.400\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n114\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there we are.\n\n115\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.380\nWe now have a basic.\n\n116\n00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.791\nNow, it doesn't look great.\n\n117\n00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:43.644\nWe're gonna make it look a little\nbit better, hopefully, at the end.\n\n118\n00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:44.630\n&gt;&gt; Candy canes and stuff.\n\n119\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.502\n&gt;&gt; Candy canes, yeah, sure.\n\n120\n00:05:46.502 --> 00:05:47.477\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You need to actually\n\n121\n00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:48.350\nadd a few things in.\n\n122\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.970\nBut at the very beginning here, editing or\nand entering text is pretty much the key,\n\n123\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.980\nand the nice thing that\nyou're seeing here is what?\n\n124\n00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.000\nRight away, it tells you what to do.\n\n125\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.750\nNow, we're gonna worry about\ndoing the formatting and\n\n126\n00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.460\nkinda making it look pretty.\n\n127\n00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.960\n&gt;&gt; Afterwards.\n\n128\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.840\n&gt;&gt; A little bit more.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n129\n00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.860\n&gt;&gt; But now I have this well,\n\n130\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.270\nthat's kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Next.\n\n131\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kind of a.\n\n132\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.750\nBut I need another slide, okay?\n\n133\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.760\nSo, the great thing is I go to\nthe Home tab, and then right here,\n\n134\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.760\nwhere it says Slides,\nthe slide grouping, notice that I have\n\n135\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.960\nanother section here where I can\nactually select New Slide, okay?\n\n136\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.327\nNow, this is one of those unusual things.\n\n137\n00:06:26.327 --> 00:06:28.061\nWe can actually do something like this,\n\n138\n00:06:28.061 --> 00:06:31.586\nbut we've also seen in other programs\nwhere there's templates that we wanna do.\n\n139\n00:06:31.586 --> 00:06:35.920\nI could click on File, and\ninstead go to new if I wanted to.\n\n140\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.450\nAnd notice, again,\nwe have templates available.\n\n141\n00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.609\nSo, you can actually make these templates.\n\n142\n00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:43.267\nMost of them are probably not used\nto doing something like a review or\n\n143\n00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:46.552\na candidacy for elfhood is what\nwe're taking a look at here.\n\n144\n00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:47.852\n&gt;&gt; This is definitely unique, yeah.\n\n145\n00:06:47.852 --> 00:06:51.849\n&gt;&gt; But here, seasonal elves, we'll say\na candidate for seasonal elves here.\n\n146\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.570\nSeasonal elves, see?\n\n147\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.190\nI added in an extra special\nlittle adjective in there,\n\n148\n00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.280\nand that kinda helps out, right?\n\n149\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.506\nSo, at this point, I need another slide,\nso I'm gonna click New, and now,\n\n150\n00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.860\nnotice that I have some different things.\n\n151\n00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.742\n&gt;&gt; Basic templates.\n\n152\n00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:07.962\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some basic templates.\n\n153\n00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:13.063\nAnd that's kinda the key, so\nwhat I want to do at this point though Is\n\n154\n00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:19.120\nnotice it gives me some ways that I can\nkind of judge the content by default.\n\n155\n00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.100\nSo, I know I want a picture,\nand of course,\n\n156\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.800\nI wanna add in some captions\nto the picture, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.940\nSo, let's go ahead and\nselect picture with caption.\n\n158\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.391\nAnd now notice on the left-hand side over\nhere, it actually is starting to do this,\n\n159\n00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:33.521\nand Cherokee, if I wanna add a picture,\n\n160\n00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:36.135\nI'm just gonna test your\namazing ability here.\n\n161\n00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:36.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n162\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.030\ntrying to see if you can understand\nwhat PowerPoint is trying to say.\n\n163\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.450\nCherokee, if I wanted to add\na picture in here, how would I do so\n\n164\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.530\nif you'd never actually\nthat PowerPoint before?\n\n165\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.337\nI might follow the on screen prompts, that\nwould probably be a good starting point\n\n166\n00:07:48.337 --> 00:07:51.261\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think that's exactly what\n\n167\n00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:55.469\nI'm gonna do,\nbecause it sounds logical, okay?\n\n168\n00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:56.932\nSo, that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n169\n00:07:56.932 --> 00:07:58.961\nSo, I'm just gonna click.\n\n170\n00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:01.644\nAnd now, I need to go to my Desktop and\n\n171\n00:08:01.644 --> 00:08:06.920\nI have a few pictures here that we\nwant actually be able to add in.\n\n172\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.820\nSo at this point,\nI took a couple of pictures.\n\n173\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.890\nThey are all sideways.\n\n174\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.845\nWell, we'll have to deal with\nthat a little bit later here.\n\n175\n00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:12.900\n&gt;&gt; All right\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\n\n176\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.970\nadd in Erin at this point and\nclick Insert.\n\n177\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.040\nSo now, we've added in Erin.\n\n178\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.900\n&gt;&gt; Hi Erin.\n&gt;&gt; Right here at ITProTV and\n\n179\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.710\nI don't like the fact\nthat she is sideways.\n\n180\n00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.900\nSo, now we can do this.\n\n181\n00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.025\nOops, better not scrunch her.\n\n182\n00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:28.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She would not appreciate that, but\n\n183\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.220\nI can crop her picture.\n\n184\n00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.870\nSo then, I can reduce this down\n\n185\n00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.890\nwithout actually changing\nthe ratios a little bit here.\n\n186\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.380\nOops, see I did it again.\n\n187\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.750\nThere.\nI have to hover over the little\n\n188\n00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.750\nblack handles here.\n\n189\n00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.070\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And we can do this.\n\n190\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.580\nAll right, so now that I've got that,\nI can put her back up here and now,\n\n191\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.610\nlet's see.\n\n192\n00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.260\nWhat's a position type of elf that\nshe would probably be applying for?\n\n193\n00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.740\nI'm going to say,\nshe wants to be chief of elves.\n\n194\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; What do you think?\n\n195\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.160\n&gt;&gt; I think that sounds good.\n\n196\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.690\n&gt;&gt; I think that sounds like Erin.\n\n197\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.770\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n198\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.023\nSo here's Erin.\n\n199\n00:09:10.023 --> 00:09:11.542\nOkay.\n\n200\n00:09:11.542 --> 00:09:15.720\nAnd she loves\n\n201\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:22.330\nthe season and loves to wear funny hats.\n\n202\n00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.450\nAll right, so right here we just\nadded in some of the content, right.\n\n203\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.640\nWe're not really doing anything gigantic,\nspectacular, but\n\n204\n00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.525\nwe can add in more stuff later on, okay.\n\n205\n00:09:38.525 --> 00:09:40.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We also want to go ahead and\n\n206\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.570\ndo another one again, so\nI have a couple options.\n\n207\n00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.530\nI can right-click here and\nadd a new slide directly from here,\n\n208\n00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.340\nwhere I can duplicate this slide or\neven delete it.\n\n209\n00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.260\nSo, I'm going to add new slide and\n\n210\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.750\nlook, it automatically says,-\n&gt;&gt; Same format.\n\n211\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.800\n&gt;&gt; hey, here it is.\n\n212\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.630\nSo, we're going to select another one\nhere and this is going to be Megan.\n\n213\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.670\nAnd Megan to-\n\n214\n00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:07.080\nI'm just going to crop the picture,\nso I don't change the ratio.\n\n215\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.240\n&gt;&gt; The ratio and\n\n216\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.840\ncause people to regret that they allowed\nme to take their picture [LAUGH].\n\n217\n00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.982\nI can't cut her off, that's.\n\n218\n00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.858\nDo this, there we go.\n\n219\n00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:25.222\n&gt;&gt;

Chief of trouble.\n\n292\n00:13:46.902 --> 00:13:48.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n293\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.750\nThat's sounds about right.\n\n294\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:57.465\n&gt;&gt; We will make up the naughty or nice-\n\n295\n00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:06.289\nlist, right.\n\n296\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.370\nSo we'll go ahead and make up a naughty or\nnice list at any time.\n\n297\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.840\nYou ask us to do it and\nwe'll definitely do it, okay.\n\n298\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.650\nNow, when we start to take a look\nat something like this, right.\n\n299\n00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:21.290\nIt's not really in any particular format,\nbut it's the basic contents that I want.\n\n300\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.150\nI want to see how this shows up.\n\n301\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.120\nWell, I can actually click on\nSlide Show here at the top and\n\n302\n00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.180\nthen, start from the beginning and\nthere we go.\n\n303\n00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.040\nMy candidates for\nseasonal elves here and there's Jerrick.\n\n304\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.970\nNope, this is Erin here, and\nshe's Chief of the Elves here.\n\n305\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.760\nThere's us, Chief of Trouble and then,\n\n306\n00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.690\nthere's Megan,\nMaster of the Hot Chocolate.\n\n307\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.440\nAll right, There he is.\n\n308\n00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.940\nChief of Holiday Seasonal Orange Cheer.\n\n309\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.060\nAnd then of course the chief\nof whistling himself, Taylor.\n\n310\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:58.690\nSo we do have the ability to\ncreate a fairly easy slide show.\n\n311\n00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.490\nthat's available when\nwe started the changes.\n\n312\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.520\nNow, I want to put this on\na different order though.\n\n313\n00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.290\nThe great thing is over on the left hand\nside, I have this ability to do this.\n\n314\n00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.760\nAnd I can actually change this\nin a couple of options, but\n\n315\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.840\nthis is the easy one for right now.\n\n316\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.940\nIf I wanted to move things\nin a different order.\n\n317\n00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.100\nLet's put these two guys up here.\n\n318\n00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.295\nLet's put our troublemaking\nselves up here at the top and\n\n319\n00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:22.930\ns,o I can just click and drag.\n\n320\n00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:27.250\nAnd move that and essentially, reorder\nthe actual slides the way that I want to.\n\n321\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.190\nAllows us to be able to change that up and\nstart to render.\n\n322\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.890\nI can delete out slides\nfairly easily if I need to.\n\n323\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.130\nI don't want to delete out\nany slide that we have here.\n\n324\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.090\nI can delete them,\nre-duplicate them, you name it.\n\n325\n00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.990\nWe can do all of that fairly easily okay,\n\n326\n00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.960\nby just doing something\njust like what we did.\n\n327\n00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.690\n&gt;&gt; So what if we had one of these kids who\nalso wanted to apply for another position?\n\n328\n00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.960\nMaybe not elves, but something like,\n[LAUGH] spring bunny position?\n\n329\n00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.800\n&gt;&gt; Spring bunny.\n\n330\n00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.298\n&gt;&gt; Could I have two Powerpoint open and\n\n331\n00:15:58.298 --> 00:16:03.139\nmove the slides from one Powerpoint\nto the other and integrate that?\n\n332\n00:16:03.139 --> 00:16:05.372\nI guess application into the other show.\n\n333\n00:16:05.372 --> 00:16:08.882\n&gt;&gt; You can actually merge\nPowerPoint slides together,\n\n334\n00:16:08.882 --> 00:16:11.067\nyou surely can be able to do that.\n\n335\n00:16:11.067 --> 00:16:14.794\nIt takes a little bit of time to get used\nto doing that, because depending on how\n\n336\n00:16:14.794 --> 00:16:17.630\nbig that slide deck actually is,\nyou might find it harder.\n\n337\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.490\nBecause you'll see a little preview screen\nand then have to zip through that to be\n\n338\n00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.590\nable to open it up and see exactly\nwhat slides that you want in there.\n\n339\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.810\nSo, the nice thing is let's say\nthat we realized something here.\n\n340\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:35.120\nThat at this point,\nI should have it another one but\n\n341\n00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.700\nI didn't actually get his photo in here.\n\n342\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.660\nLet me see if I can find another one,\nlet me do one more if I can.\n\n343\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.140\nSo, let's say that we have\na late entry that came and\n\n344\n00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.200\nI need to add in another one.\n\n345\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.330\nI didn't put them in that picture,\nlet me go back to the shared folder here.\n\n346\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.840\nI think, no, it's not actually in there.\n\n347\n00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.870\nThere it is, pics.\n\n348\n00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.730\nNo I did not actually add it, nevermind.\n\n349\n00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.858\nI thought I actually added Daniel in here,\nbut I just don't have Daniel's picture.\n\n350\n00:17:01.858 --> 00:17:02.920\n&gt;&gt; Daniel's safe.\n\n351\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.491\nYeah, he's safe from our monitor.\n\n352\n00:17:03.491 --> 00:17:05.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For now.\n\n353\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.050\n&gt;&gt; But let's say that we wanna\nadd someone in, and then he said,\n\n354\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.300\nI don't really wanna be in this, I wanna\nkeep him just in case he says yes again.\n\n355\n00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.990\nI can actually just hide this\nparticular slide instead, and\n\n356\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.460\neven though he's there,\nit just hides him from that.\n\n357\n00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.130\nAnd what does that allow you to do?\n\n358\n00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.440\nIn a regular presentation, it allows you\nthen to say, this slide's not relevant for\n\n359\n00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.878\nthis presentation day.\n\n360\n00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:28.870\nI just wanna hide it, but\nI may actually use it later in the week.\n\n361\n00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.330\nAnd then I can unhide it\nwithout having the lead or\n\n362\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.040\nsave to our three different out\nPowerPoints as long with us.\n\n363\n00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.540\nSo, about being how to do that,\nit allows us to,\n\n364\n00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.996\nagain, create just a very simple\ntype of the PowerPoint option.\n\n365\n00:17:40.996 --> 00:17:45.860\nNow, we've already changed a few different\noptions here in terms of the picture that\n\n366\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.120\nwe added in, but we also wanna\nstart formatting it a little bit.\n\n367\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.500\nOkay, so, I'm not gonna add in a lot,\n\n368\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:57.050\ncuz you can get really crazy on\nadding in on a ton of things here.\n\n369\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:02.010\nSo, I'm just gonna select this first\nslide, and then from this point here\n\n370\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:07.780\nI can add in some clip\nart if we want it to.\n\n371\n00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:13.434\nAnd we can type in, let's see, christmas.\n\n372\n00:18:15.503 --> 00:18:18.330\nNow you're watching this\nin this July anything.\n\n373\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.205\nWhy are they doing christmas?\n\n374\n00:18:19.205 --> 00:18:23.490\nCuz that's the time of the recording that\nwe have right now, I can add in a star,\n\n375\n00:18:25.869 --> 00:18:28.844\nAnd just kind of a opulate.\n\n376\n00:18:28.844 --> 00:18:29.660\n&gt;&gt; Looks like Macy's.\n\n377\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.262\n&gt;&gt; Macy's, that's exactly what\nI was going for, I think.\n\n378\n00:18:33.262 --> 00:18:39.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Trying to get him out,\n\n379\n00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:39.900\nyeah, there we go.\n\n380\n00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.860\n&gt;&gt; So, are these little clip arts\nsomething that you downloaded, Ronnie, or?\n\n381\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthey're actually built into the program or\n\n382\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.190\nthey're actually going out to the Internet\nto be able to pick this up as well.\n\n383\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.770\nAnd so, you have options depending\non the way that this is connected.\n\n384\n00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.470\nSo this one's actually on\nmy computer right here.\n\n385\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.800\nSo there's a bunch of different\nelements that we can add in here.\n\n386\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.930\nAnd here's another one.\n\n387\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.540\nLet's see, I just like that, there I go.\n\n388\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.040\nToo many.\n\n389\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.520\nSo now you can resize those and\nadd additional elements to make\n\n390\n00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.410\nout all set I don't want that,\nhere you go.\n\n391\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.950\n&gt;&gt; So in addition to the clip art,\nthe photos are there any other types of\n\n392\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.040\nfiles like gifts that we would be\nable to go ahead and insert as well?\n\n393\n00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if you have access to\ngifs which allow you to be\n\n394\n00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.220\nable automate a few things it will\ngive you that ability to do so.\n\n395\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.420\nI don't know if I actually have,\n\n396\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.670\nI don't think I have any that are\navailable to me right now on my computer.\n\n397\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.150\nBut you may actually have some that you\ndownload and you can add those things in.\n\n398\n00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.840\nThat will help make this a little bit\nbetter as well, so we can do that now.\n\n399\n00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.530\nThe other thing that we can do is,\n\n400\n00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.610\nnotice that all my slider\nwhite in the background.\n\n401\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.300\nI don't wanna change every single slide,\nokay.\n\n402\n00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.880\nWhat I'd rather do though is\nchange them all at one time.\n\n403\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.940\nI can select, now let me make sure\nI'm telling you the right place, I\n\n404\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:08.775\ndon't actually need to get to what we call\nthe master slide is what I need to do.\n\n405\n00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:13.720\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie you say master slide, I got\nactually hire an employer tell me before\n\n406\n00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.410\nthat I need to go ahead and uses\ncertain theme to apply to my PowerPoint\n\n407\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.120\npresentation, when I'm gonna teach\na class, this is sort of the same thing?\n\n408\n00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.622\n&gt;&gt; It can be, right?\n\n409\n00:20:22.622 --> 00:20:26.423\nWhat we’re saying is that there's\nunderlying on us we wanna cross every\n\n410\n00:20:26.423 --> 00:20:29.300\nsingle slide,\nwe can put our company logo on the back.\n\n411\n00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.660\nWe want to change the actual slide to be\na different color and it effects every\n\n412\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:40.340\nsingle slide that we create inside of that\nparticular PowerPoint file that we have.\n\n413\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.233\nSo the way that we do that, is if I can\nfind it here, is that we click on View and\n\n414\n00:20:45.233 --> 00:20:50.369\nthen notice that I have right here what\nis called the Master View as well, okay?\n\n415\n00:20:50.369 --> 00:20:56.770\nNow, on the Master View, if I select\nSlide Master, now it changes here.\n\n416\n00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:02.160\nAnd when I select this one, or we can do\nit in a couple of different ways here.\n\n417\n00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.170\nIf I look for the one that has that\nsingle element or picture in it,\n\n418\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.290\nlet's see if I can do that.\n\n419\n00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:12.476\nSo like this one,\nwhich is kind of the outline and shape,\n\n420\n00:21:12.476 --> 00:21:17.364\nI can now right-click on particular\npicture, and then format and\n\n421\n00:21:17.364 --> 00:21:20.591\nthen I could say I want a gradient color,\nand\n\n422\n00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:25.499\nI want this one not to be preset,\nwill it actually allow me to do so.\n\n423\n00:21:25.499 --> 00:21:26.040\n&gt;&gt; It should.\n\n424\n00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.820\n&gt;&gt; No wait, I need a color,\nthat's what I needed.\n\n425\n00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:34.939\nI want this kind of darker red and\nthat'll work\n\n426\n00:21:34.939 --> 00:21:35.962\n&gt;&gt; It's like a candy cane\n\n427\n00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:39.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, almost like a candy cane.\n\n428\n00:21:39.002 --> 00:21:43.490\nNow, we can even change that direction and\nmake it more like a candy cane, like that.\n\n429\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.530\n&gt;&gt; Diagonal, cool.\n\n430\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.217\n&gt;&gt; And then click Apply to All.\n\n431\n00:21:46.217 --> 00:21:47.780\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\nI don't know how cool it actually was.\n\n432\n00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll see,\nit's probably gonna look terrible.\n\n433\n00:21:49.425 --> 00:21:50.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I can do that and\n\n434\n00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.010\nI can close this out.\n\n435\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:56.590\nAnd now notice that very easily we\nhave to actually change the actual\n\n436\n00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.220\nbackground as well and added in some of\nthe elements that we have available to us.\n\n437\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that style looks pretty crazy\nright there, but that's because it has\n\n438\n00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.990\na white background, so you'd have to\nbe careful with certain elements.\n\n439\n00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so even if you did\nhave an element like this and\n\n440\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:11.680\nyou realize it's not gonna match, well,\nif you can right-click on that and\n\n441\n00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.300\nit gives you some options,\nyou can go and format that picture.\n\n442\n00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.570\nThis one probably will not allow\nme to change the background\n\n443\n00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.440\nsince it actually does have a white one.\n\n444\n00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.880\nSo it doesn't look like I can.\n\n445\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.210\nI may just simply select it and\nget rid of it like this instead.\n\n446\n00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.660\nAnd now, this one though is\nclear in this background.\n\n447\n00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.770\nAnd now we can do something like that,\n\n448\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.410\nand that way we can start\nto use that as part of our\n\n449\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:39.200\npresentation to be able to see some of\nthe elements that we have involved there.\n\n450\n00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.413\nSo, it really does a lot.\n\n451\n00:22:40.413 --> 00:22:41.017\nNow actually,\n\n452\n00:22:41.017 --> 00:22:43.955\nlooks like I'm gonna put it down here\ncuz I want it on every single picture.\n\n453\n00:22:43.955 --> 00:22:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Look at you, you're perfecting\nyour design elements, yeah.\n\n454\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.198\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n455\n00:22:47.198 --> 00:22:49.095\n&gt;&gt; Our marketing team better watch out.\n\n456\n00:22:49.095 --> 00:22:50.441\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n457\n00:22:50.441 --> 00:22:51.382\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure they're\n\n458\n00:22:51.382 --> 00:22:53.327\nquaking at the fact that I'm doing it.\n\n459\n00:22:53.327 --> 00:22:55.510\nLet me change this on the slide master.\n\n460\n00:22:55.510 --> 00:23:00.000\nNow, what if I wanted to add that element\nin like we said for everything, for\n\n461\n00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.277\nevery single slide?\n\n462\n00:23:01.277 --> 00:23:05.440\nSo, instead of me having to go every slide\nand pick it up, I can put it down here.\n\n463\n00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.673\n&gt;&gt; If it were a company logo,\nthat would be yeah.\n\n464\n00:23:07.673 --> 00:23:11.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if that were a company logo, it\nmay actually end up helping us out here.\n\n465\n00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:17.310\nAnd then, I should have done it for all\nslides, that's fine, we'll just do it for\n\n466\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.120\nthis one for right now.\n\n467\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.208\nAnd that should actually apply to\nthe very first one, there we go.\n\n468\n00:23:22.208 --> 00:23:23.950\nLet me get rid of the one that I had here.\n\n469\n00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.890\nBut you can actually have that and\nif you select it for all the slides,\n\n470\n00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.570\nwhich I didn't do, it will also\npopulate on every single slide.\n\n471\n00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.410\nSo it allows you to set a theme for\n\n472\n00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.090\nthe way that everything pretty\nmuch looks and you can see.\n\n473\n00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:43.075\nSo there are some additional options but,\nCherokee, I think I;m running out\n\n474\n00:23:43.075 --> 00:23:47.091\nof time again as well so we may need\nto pick up on a part two later on\n\n475\n00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:48.120\n&gt;&gt; That's all right,\n\n476\n00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.357\nthe only thing we're really left is to see\nif these individuals were able to success\n\n477\n00:23:52.357 --> 00:23:56.790\nWhere we get these rolls, but I guess you\nguys will just have to find out later on.\n\n478\n00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.815\nBut thank you for\nshowing us at least how to go ahead and\n\n479\n00:23:59.815 --> 00:24:01.833\nbegin a PowerPoint presentation so\n\n480\n00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:05.955\nthat we could easily covey our messages\nin a presentation style format.\n\n481\n00:24:05.955 --> 00:24:09.190\nSo, thank you so much for that,\nand thank you guys for tuning in.\n\n482\n00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.550\nBut don't go anywhere,\n\n483\n00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.030\nwe do have some more application\ninformation headed your way.\n\n484\n00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.540\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n485\n00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.470\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n486\n00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.631\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITPro TV.\n\n487\n00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:26.929\n[MUSIC]\n\n488\n00:24:26.929 --> 00:24:28.790\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.144\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\nIC3 Key Applications show.\n\n5\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.010\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.430\nIn this episode, we're going to take a\njourney to explore Microsoft Access 2010.\n\n7\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.480\nAs our tour guide,\nwe have Ronnie Wong in studios today.\n\n8\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.880\nThank you, Ronnie, for joining us.\n\n9\n00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.679\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me,\n\n10\n00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.154\nas we go on this wonderful\ntour of Microsoft Access 2010.\n\n11\n00:00:34.154 --> 00:00:38.673\nWe're specifically diving into this\nrealm to help you to understand,\n\n12\n00:00:38.673 --> 00:00:42.156\nfirst of all,\nwhat Microsoft Access really is about.\n\n13\n00:00:42.156 --> 00:00:45.992\nAnd then I'm gonna show you how to\ncreate just a basic functionality,\n\n14\n00:00:45.992 --> 00:00:49.243\nwhich is the idea of databases,\nand how you can do that, and\n\n15\n00:00:49.243 --> 00:00:51.780\nalso work with them just a little bit.\n\n16\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.690\nSo it's kind of a strange realm because\nthe idea that we've been taking you\n\n17\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.170\nthrough are some of the different\nproductivity apps that we've actually had.\n\n18\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.490\nAnd so we've talked about\nthe idea of using something\n\n19\n00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.580\nlike Microsoft Word 2010,\nas well as Excel and even PowerPoint.\n\n20\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.450\nAnd all of that is,\nwell, rather intuitive.\n\n21\n00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.820\nDo you understand working with words and\ndocuments?\n\n22\n00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.040\nWell, a word processing\nprogram seems to be key.\n\n23\n00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.610\nYou understand when you actually\nhave to work with a lot numbers.\n\n24\n00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.720\nAnd be able to analyze the data, making\ncharts, and be able to put all that data\n\n25\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.990\nin one place, such as using Excel\nis another one, that seems great.\n\n26\n00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.930\nAnd then being able to take all\nthat data and those words and\n\n27\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.830\ncombining them together to do something\nlike a presentation also seems logical.\n\n28\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.899\nBut when it comes down to\nthe area of databases,\n\n29\n00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.526\nthis is where we get the most\nmisunderstanding that ends up happening.\n\n30\n00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:52.182\nAnd this is one of the most confusing\nprograms that's actually available out\n\n31\n00:01:52.182 --> 00:01:56.907\nthere because most of us have never tried\nto think about designing a database or\n\n32\n00:01:56.907 --> 00:01:58.960\neven needing a database.\n\n33\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.950\nSo that's what we're actually going to do,\nokay?\n\n34\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.640\nSo if I set the stage for\n\n35\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.250\nyou as you start entering into the world\nin which you're gonna be working with\n\n36\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.630\ncomputers on a daily basis,\nyou're gonna learn something very quickly.\n\n37\n00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.260\nDatabases exist everywhere, and\nusually, the information that\n\n38\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.880\nyou actually retrieve is gonna be\npulled out of a database somewhere.\n\n39\n00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.343\nSo for example, if you end up working\nat a help desk some place and\n\n40\n00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:29.139\nnow you're actually asking somebody for\ntheir customer ID number or\n\n41\n00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.370\nfor their address,\nyou're going to enter that into a form.\n\n42\n00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.486\nYou're gonna press a button, and it's\ngonna fill in the rest of the data for\n\n43\n00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:39.430\nyou so that you can see that.\n\n44\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.930\nWell that information's gonna\nbe pulled out of a database and\n\n45\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.320\nsent over to your computer screen.\n\n46\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.100\nThe other thing that you may also end up\ndoing, which is fairly simple as well,\n\n47\n00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.750\nis that you may end up working for\na company doing some type of data entry.\n\n48\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.090\nAnd the idea of data entry is\nkind of the opposite idea here.\n\n49\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.790\nWhere what they do is they might\nhand you a stack of forms that\n\n50\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.630\ntheir particular customer relations\npeople have actually said,\n\n51\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.250\nhere's all the data that's available.\n\n52\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.414\nWe need you to just go ahead and enter\nin the data that you find on these forms\n\n53\n00:03:14.414 --> 00:03:17.180\nin each of the fields that's available.\n\n54\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.140\nSo you're gonna end up seeing\nstuff like that all the time.\n\n55\n00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.765\nAnd the nice thing about it is that\neven if the form's electronic,\n\n56\n00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:26.514\nwhen you're doing data entry,\n\n57\n00:03:26.514 --> 00:03:30.810\nthey normally try to mirror it fairly\nclosely to the actual handwritten form.\n\n58\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.450\nSo that you don't make a mistake on where\nthat data entry is supposed to occur.\n\n59\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.380\nSo what I'm telling you is\nthat even though you might not\n\n60\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.360\nencounter the idea of databases\ndirectly as far as creating one and\n\n61\n00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.690\nmaking one, well, you will encounter\nthem on a daily basis in terms of work.\n\n62\n00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.513\nBut Access though is what we call\nan end-user type of database program\n\n63\n00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:57.928\nthat allows you to create simple\ndatabases that might be good for\n\n64\n00:03:57.928 --> 00:04:02.689\nneeds of a business, it might be good for\npersonal use as well, too.\n\n65\n00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.970\nAnd so that's normally where you begin.\n\n66\n00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.890\nSo, most of the time, where people end up\nusing something like Access is simple.\n\n67\n00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.110\nSomebody says look, I've got 1,000\nrecipes, and you might say who the heck\n\n68\n00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.710\nhas 1,000 recipes, well, my wife does,\nshe's actually who has 1,000 recipes.\n\n69\n00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:23.984\nAnd in that sense, when she had to go and\nfind information about that recipe,\n\n70\n00:04:23.984 --> 00:04:29.015\nsuch as she wants to make a chicken dish,\nwell it used to be fairly simple,\n\n71\n00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:32.200\nshe would go and\nbring those recipe books out.\n\n72\n00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.180\nAnd she looked through each one in\nthe index, find all the recipes, and\n\n73\n00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.080\njust kind of go, this is what I want,\nthis is what I don't want.\n\n74\n00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.170\nWell, by taking time to build\na simple database program for\n\n75\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.490\nmy wife is actually fairly easy.\n\n76\n00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.170\nNow all she has to do is go and\nfind the search field, look for\n\n77\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.420\nchicken entrees or dishes,\nand then press Enter, and\n\n78\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.760\nit brings up every single one of them\nwith a title of what the dish is.\n\n79\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.520\nAnd if she wants it,\nall she has to do is click on it,\n\n80\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.310\nand that opens up the entire recipe for\nher and she can find that.\n\n81\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.840\nSo on a personal level,\nyou can do something like that.\n\n82\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.690\nThe idea of keeping track of movies\nis another one that people also do.\n\n83\n00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.320\nIf you love wine and you can do that, you\ncan make a database for all the different\n\n84\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.510\nwines that you have sampled or that you\nhave in your own collection as well.\n\n85\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.950\nSo you name it, there's a whole\nbunch of uses on a personal level.\n\n86\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.190\nIn a business level, you might go,\n\n87\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.730\nI'm not gonna be creating\na database that's really big.\n\n88\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.780\nBut you may actually\ncreate one fairly small,\n\n89\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.760\nlike what we're gonna do in\nour program today as well.\n\n90\n00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.217\nSo we want you to understand the basic\nconcepts at the very beginning, and\n\n91\n00:05:30.217 --> 00:05:33.135\nthen we're gonna go on Access and\nshow you how to create this.\n\n92\n00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:33.680\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n93\n00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.030\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go ahead and take\na look at some of the basic concepts here.\n\n94\n00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.350\nNow I went ahead and created a diagram\nto try and help us out a little bit.\n\n95\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.420\nSo, the great thing is, since you've\nalready taken a look at the IC3,\n\n96\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.080\nworking or working with Microsoft Excel,\n\n97\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.580\nwe've already talked about the idea\nof spreadsheet programs, right?\n\n98\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.270\nSo Excel is essentially\na spreadsheet program.\n\n99\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.560\nAnd this is where we store\ndata in tabular form.\n\n100\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.770\nNow a tabular form means a table.\n\n101\n00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.560\nA table,\nin the way that we store information,\n\n102\n00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.660\nconsists of columns of data,\nwhich is the vertical, and\n\n103\n00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.340\nthen of course, rows of data going across,\nand that's fine.\n\n104\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.220\nAs long as all of the actual data itself\nis related to each other, storing\n\n105\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.820\nthat same type of data in an individual\ntable is the way that we want to.\n\n106\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.010\nYou may actually\n\n107\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.770\nhave another table that you keep\nof different types of information.\n\n108\n00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.620\nNow inside of spreadsheets,\n\n109\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.890\nthe information is generally not\nnecessarily related to each other.\n\n110\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.080\nSo you can, you can actually create\nmultiple different Excel workbooks for\n\n111\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.696\ndifferent types of data or\ndifferent departments that [CROSSTALK]\n\n112\n00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:45.736\n&gt;&gt; Concepts.\n\n113\n00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:50.178\n&gt;&gt; Concepts, but usually, it's about\ncompanies in terms of departments, or\n\n114\n00:06:50.178 --> 00:06:54.280\nyou're actually trying to keep\nseparate data because it's financial\n\n115\n00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.610\ndata that's different\nareas of your management.\n\n116\n00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.670\nWhatever it might be, but usually,\nthe data is not interrelated.\n\n117\n00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.670\nIf we take a look over here\non the right hand side,\n\n118\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.570\nI tried to talk about the idea\nof the logical relationship.\n\n119\n00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.430\nSo if we kind of take a look at\nthese three tables over here,\n\n120\n00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.870\neven though we might say hey, the data\nis actually separate tables of data,\n\n121\n00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.270\nwe find some commonality and\nlinkage between all these tables.\n\n122\n00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.530\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhy is that important?\n\n123\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.020\nIt's important because once we find\nthe link between those tables,\n\n124\n00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.560\nit allows us then to find some piece\nof random data in here on this table.\n\n125\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.680\nAnd be able to pull information\nout of this other table and\n\n126\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.610\nthis other table, and\nhave them reported out\n\n127\n00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.640\nto where we actually know\nexactly what we're looking for.\n\n128\n00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.920\nSo that's kind of the key when we\nstart thinking about it logically.\n\n129\n00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.430\n&gt;&gt; So I have a question here for\nyou, Ronnie.\n\n130\n00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.483\nI was just wondering if, to make sure\nI understand properly, let's say we're\n\n131\n00:07:55.483 --> 00:07:59.189\nlooking at these three fields, and\nI have January, February, March.\n\n132\n00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:03.304\nMaybe I have a shop online where I sell\nsomething that I make, like jewelry,\n\n133\n00:08:03.304 --> 00:08:04.542\nand I have a customer.\n\n134\n00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:07.623\nMaybe each one of those\nboxes represent each month,\n\n135\n00:08:07.623 --> 00:08:10.297\nthe orders that have\nhappened in that month?\n\n136\n00:08:10.297 --> 00:08:14.608\nAnd then maybe the relationship,\nthe correlation between those lines,\n\n137\n00:08:14.608 --> 00:08:17.320\nthere could be something\nlike that same user,\n\n138\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.880\nmaybe they placed an order in January,\nFebruary and March.\n\n139\n00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.950\nAnd so they would time it in that way,\ndoes that make sense to you?\n\n140\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.370\n&gt;&gt; You can, it just depends on how\nyou keep track of that information.\n\n141\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.770\nSo a lot of times, what you're looking for\nin the idea of the commonality here\n\n142\n00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.720\nis that you have a field of data,\na column of data.\n\n143\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.750\nThat you're actually keeping track of for\n\n144\n00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.540\none table that you can also\nadd in to another table.\n\n145\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.740\nAnd then you can actually have another\ntable that might also connect you back\n\n146\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.560\nto another table as well.\n\n147\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.840\nAnd that's what forms the link.\n\n148\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.430\nAnd that way you can go and search for\neverything that Cherokee Boose\n\n149\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.090\nbought in the months of January,\nFebruary, and March if you wanted to.\n\n150\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.920\nOr you can actually look up by categories\nof items if that's what tracked here or\n\n151\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.170\nyou could go even the opposite way.\n\n152\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.195\nIf Cherokee has spent a lot of money\non shoes we can actually look up shoes.\n\n153\n00:09:07.195 --> 00:09:09.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And then filter by Cherokee Boose and\n\n154\n00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:14.170\nsee whatever that amount of\nrows of data that turns out.\n\n155\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.030\nSo it is very possible to do that.\n\n156\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.080\nNow, can we do it with\nregular spreadsheets?\n\n157\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.920\nYes, you can.\n\n158\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.370\nBut the way that you would do that\nin a single spreadsheet though,\n\n159\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.130\na single spreadsheet is that you\nwould keep adding in another column.\n\n160\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.899\nSo take for an example like Cherokee.\n\n161\n00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:32.340\nIf we actually said she is going\nto be one of our customers.\n\n162\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.697\nWell then once we actually have her in\nthere and she makes her first purchase,\n\n163\n00:09:36.697 --> 00:09:39.640\nwe actually put in the cost\nof the first purchase.\n\n164\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.035\nAnd then we put it what item that\nshe sold, what item she bought.\n\n165\n00:09:43.035 --> 00:09:45.498\nAnd then the second time Cherokee\ncomes in we add another column.\n\n166\n00:09:45.498 --> 00:09:48.280\nWhatever that second item in and\nthe cost of it.\n\n167\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.280\nAnd then it continues to\ngo from that point on.\n\n168\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.540\nWell what if she buys two pairs of shoes?\n\n169\n00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.750\nWell, we have to keep adding in a column.\n\n170\n00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.650\nAnd so now all of a sudden,\nwe have a single spreadsheet and\n\n171\n00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.960\nit's now actually got let's say,\n5000 columns in it.\n\n172\n00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.985\nAnd that's all just to help to\ntrack what Cherokee does in itself.\n\n173\n00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:10.640\nIn the way that databases work,\nthe idea is fairly simple.\n\n174\n00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.620\nWe only want the data\nnecessarily that's in there,\n\n175\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.200\nto be entered in one time and\none time only.\n\n176\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.560\nSo in that particular instance,\nthat's what's gonna happen.\n\n177\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.460\nNow, what we're really talking about is\na theory that's called relational database\n\n178\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.710\ndesign.\n\n179\n00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.250\nNow that's a term that you're gonna\nsay I'm never gonna remember that.\n\n180\n00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.828\nThat's great, that's fine.\n\n181\n00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:34.483\nBut that's how it ends up working\nis that we store the data one time.\n\n182\n00:10:34.483 --> 00:10:37.979\nSo for\nexample in this table we just go in and\n\n183\n00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:42.570\nwe store Cherokee's customer\ninformation about her.\n\n184\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.200\nAnd then because she's a customer\nwith my company we also give her,\n\n185\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.600\nwhat, something like a customer ID number.\n\n186\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.760\nBut then I actually have\na table of merchandise.\n\n187\n00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.820\nLet's say it's gonna\nbe this one down here.\n\n188\n00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.140\nAnd every single piece of\nmerchandise that I have,\n\n189\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.550\nI also have some type of asset tag on it,\nsome type of ID on it.\n\n190\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.480\nSo let's take, for\n\n191\n00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.920\nan example, shoes with red bottoms on\nit cuz since Cherokee likes those.\n\n192\n00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have a number for\n\n193\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.650\nthat particular shoe, that style.\n\n194\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.150\nWhatever it is it's\ngoing to be individual.\n\n195\n00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.720\nIt's going to be unique.\n\n196\n00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.740\nAnd then I have a table that might\ntrack the sales of those items.\n\n197\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.690\nSo that way when I do sub inside this\ntable it might include in her ID number.\n\n198\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.650\nIt might include in the ID number for\nthat shoe, that model, that type.\n\n199\n00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.470\nAnd then when I run a report it\nactually is able to pull Cherokee Boose\n\n200\n00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.060\nwith that particular sale number.\n\n201\n00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.910\nAnd then that sale number\nlinks to that item as well.\n\n202\n00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.707\nAnd that's what we talk about in\nterms of relational database design.\n\n203\n00:11:40.707 --> 00:11:47.267\nSo it all has to do with the idea\nof understanding the basic design.\n\n204\n00:11:47.267 --> 00:11:50.774\nAll data that we keep inside of a data\nbase is stored in terms of rows and\n\n205\n00:11:50.774 --> 00:11:53.630\ncolumns which actually becomes a table.\n\n206\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.060\nSo, here's an example of\nwhat we talked about here.\n\n207\n00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.270\nSo, when I talk about the idea of\na customer we're gonna change this up\n\n208\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.370\na little bit because it is the time for\nthe season of the year.\n\n209\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.760\nWe start tracking a few different things.\n\n210\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.280\nSo, right here, let us just say,\nI've created a table,\n\n211\n00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.500\nand notice that right here\nI've given it a name.\n\n212\n00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.870\nSo, you might see something that looks\na little bit strange, like this too.\n\n213\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.520\nEverybody names them something different a\nlot of times it's a little more intuitive.\n\n214\n00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.496\nBut notice I have a prefix here and\nthen I have the name.\n\n215\n00:12:21.496 --> 00:12:25.714\nThe underscores may not necessarily\nbe important, but it could be,\n\n216\n00:12:25.714 --> 00:12:29.070\nit depends on the type of\ndatabase that you're using.\n\n217\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.390\nBut that just helps me to know that I\nactually did separate out the name here.\n\n218\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:39.210\nAlso I have my columns of data,\nFirstName, LastName and the Employee ID.\n\n219\n00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.700\nSo when we take a look at all of this,\n\n220\n00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.900\nI've just listed the ones that's\nright here in the studio.\n\n221\n00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.400\nAnd then of course on our\nproduction staff right now,\n\n222\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.362\nto make an example of the point.\n\n223\n00:12:48.362 --> 00:12:49.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So this is actually what we have.\n\n224\n00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.140\nWe have now columns and\nrows of data that we're going to do.\n\n225\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.760\nSo I have that.\n\n226\n00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.280\nNow, notice again that is\nthe structure and that is the term.\n\n227\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.720\nThat we're actually taking a look at.\n\n228\n00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.870\nSo, we have what we call a row of data.\n\n229\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.890\nYou also hear the term record,\nwhen you have a column of data.\n\n230\n00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.980\nYou'll also hear the term fields as well,\nso you'll actually see both of those used.\n\n231\n00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.020\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie,\ngetting started with this program.\n\n232\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.570\nWould I be able to run this on\njust a regular work station?\n\n233\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.590\nIt seems very strong, very powerful.\n\n234\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.170\nWould I need a bigger machine or\nsomething a little more expensive?\n\n235\n00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.620\n&gt;&gt; You can run it on a fairly easy,\n\n236\n00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.590\nnot a super high performance\ntype of machine if you need to.\n\n237\n00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.250\nIt just depends on the amount of data.\n\n238\n00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.670\nSo here's what we're\ngonna end up creating.\n\n239\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.870\nSo I went a head and\nI've created this list.\n\n240\n00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.820\nThe other thing that I've also\ncreated is right over here.\n\n241\n00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.120\nSo let's take a look at the full screen so\nthat we can match this up.\n\n242\n00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.490\nBecause we're going to be\ndoing something like a gift\n\n243\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.260\nlist is what we're gonna be doing.\n\n244\n00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.436\nSo over here on the far right-hand side,\n\n245\n00:13:53.436 --> 00:13:58.020\nI've got a table of secret prizes\nthat I want to be able to give out.\n\n246\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.320\nSo here it is.\n\n247\n00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.453\nI've got a column header, so we've got an\nOpus Coffee Gift that we can actually use.\n\n248\n00:14:03.453 --> 00:14:03.980\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n249\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.350\n&gt;&gt; Lunch at some local eatery.\n\n250\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.450\nThat sounds like a great ideal.\n\n251\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.200\n&gt;&gt; Out to eat.\n\n252\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.573\n&gt;&gt; Gourmet cupcakes cuz I know that-.\n\n253\n00:14:08.573 --> 00:14:09.486\n&gt;&gt; That's my favorite.\n\n254\n00:14:09.486 --> 00:14:11.730\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nCherokee likes gourmet cupcakes.\n\n255\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.060\nCar wash with a particular scent added in.\n\n256\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.800\nEverybody loves that kind of,\ncupcake scent.\n\n257\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.380\nTwo movie tickets, but\nonly the senior matinee of course.\n\n258\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.160\nAnd then a 24 inch pizza.\n\n259\n00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.180\nThat all sounds great.\n\n260\n00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.420\nNow, I want to link this back to\nwho I'm going to give this to.\n\n261\n00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.560\nSo over here, I've got this table\nthat says, let's do a matchup.\n\n262\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.160\nSo I've created this table with\nthe employee IDs in it, but\n\n263\n00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.330\nnotice I don't have any prizes here.\n\n264\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:44.810\nSo Cherokee, I'm just gonna give you\none chance to take a look at this here.\n\n265\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:45.680\nSo there you go.\n\n266\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n267\n00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.350\nnow We're doing this randomly.\n\n268\n00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.008\nSo Cherokee, go ahead-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n269\n00:14:52.008 --> 00:14:55.606\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and give me a number beginning\n\n270\n00:14:55.606 --> 00:15:00.222\nwith 1,000, through 1,011 I think.\n\n271\n00:15:00.222 --> 00:15:01.718\nOr 1,100, okay.\n\n272\n00:15:01.718 --> 00:15:02.787\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n273\n00:15:02.787 --> 00:15:04.507\n&gt;&gt; But well, actually,\nit's just some of these numbers here.\n\n274\n00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:06.359\nSo actually,\nit's actually these three prizes.\n\n275\n00:15:06.359 --> 00:15:07.620\nLet's do it this way.\nThat's actually easier.\n\n276\n00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.139\nSo just give me a prize ID number\nover here and we'll match them up.\n\n277\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.427\n&gt;&gt; For the first field?\n\n278\n00:15:13.427 --> 00:15:14.369\n&gt;&gt; For the first one.\n\n279\n00:15:14.369 --> 00:15:17.799\n&gt;&gt; All right, 001\n&gt;&gt; 001.\n\n280\n00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:19.641\nSecond one.\n\n281\n00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:21.777\n&gt;&gt; 011 [LAUGH].\n\n282\n00:15:21.777 --> 00:15:22.830\n&gt;&gt; 011.\n\n283\n00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.807\nAll right.\n\n284\n00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:26.052\n&gt;&gt; 100.\n\n285\n00:15:26.052 --> 00:15:28.766\n&gt;&gt; 100.\n\n286\n00:15:28.766 --> 00:15:31.073\nAnd for this one?\n\n287\n00:15:31.073 --> 00:15:34.417\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, 010.\n\n288\n00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:37.397\n&gt;&gt; 010.\n\n289\n00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:38.863\n&gt;&gt; 110.\n\n290\n00:15:38.863 --> 00:15:39.490\n&gt;&gt; 110.\n\n291\n00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.752\n&gt;&gt; 101.\n\n292\n00:15:40.752 --> 00:15:42.264\n&gt;&gt; 101, okay.\n\n293\n00:15:42.264 --> 00:15:44.830\nSo as long as you're unique, that's fine.\n\n294\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.080\nNow how do we actually know who they match\nup to and how we are going to do this?\n\n295\n00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.432\nWell, what we do is we take\nthat table that I created.\n\n296\n00:15:52.432 --> 00:15:58.280\nAnd now I link them together\nby using what's in common.\n\n297\n00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.790\nSo I can actually link\nthese two columns together.\n\n298\n00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:10.757\nAnd I can also link these\ntwo columns together here.\n\n299\n00:16:13.225 --> 00:16:16.590\nAnd now that I've done that, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:21.970\nNow just by looking at this,\nCherokee, okay, what can we find out?\n\n301\n00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.840\nCan you find out what gift was\nactually assigned to Peter.\n\n302\n00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Very easily, okay,\n\n303\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.710\nand the reason why is that\nnow Cherokee has this one.\n\n304\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.930\nWhich is this number.\n\n305\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.410\nSo she simply goes and\nlooks in this column here.\n\n306\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.080\n&gt;&gt; Lunch @ Local Eatery.\n\n307\n00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.680\n&gt;&gt; And now, yep, there it is.\n\n308\n00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.105\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Lunch @ Local Eatery, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:40.105 --> 00:16:43.000\nSo notice that I didn't have\nto reenter the information\n\n310\n00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.890\nmultiple times to get this.\n\n311\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.090\nWe only entered in\nthe information in one place,\n\n312\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.450\none time and\nthat's what ends up happening.\n\n313\n00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:55.130\nSo every single record in every table\nof this database is actually unique.\n\n314\n00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.110\nSo that's all we actually have to be able\nto do is have the information there,\n\n315\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.310\nwhere it can actually be done this way.\n\n316\n00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.660\nNow, tracking this manually, right?\n\n317\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.940\nCreating a database\nmanually sounds terrible.\n\n318\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:11.820\nIt doesn't sound like something that you\nreally need to try and do in this way.\n\n319\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.220\nWell, that's why we have\na program like Microsoft Access\n\n320\n00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.690\nthat can help us to understand what\nwe're actually going to end up doing.\n\n321\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:22.510\nSo once we get all this\ninformation into our database,\n\n322\n00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.040\nwe can then ask questions\nabout our database.\n\n323\n00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.240\nAnd then that way it can also\nend up giving us the answer\n\n324\n00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.930\njust like what I made Cherokee do right\nhere, was to be able to find out.\n\n325\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:38.622\nSo if she wants to find out what\ngift let's see Taylor has, the 1011.\n\n326\n00:17:38.622 --> 00:17:41.874\nWell, he got an Opus\ncoffee gift right there.\n\n327\n00:17:41.874 --> 00:17:43.673\nSo very easily done in this.\n\n328\n00:17:43.673 --> 00:17:45.856\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had to make sure\nI got what I wanted there.\n\n329\n00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:46.622\nI cheated.\n\n330\n00:17:46.622 --> 00:17:51.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You cheated, well, that's pretty sad.\n\n331\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.030\nThat you cheat there.\n\n332\n00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.910\nAll right, so let's go ahead and do this.\n\n333\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.450\nSo I need to find my machine\nthat I'm gonna go to.\n\n334\n00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.430\nThat I have access running to.\n\n335\n00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:06.930\nSo now if I go ahead and click on\nthe Start button and I go to All Programs,\n\n336\n00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:12.480\nit's inside of the Microsoft Office folder\n\n337\n00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:18.330\nthat we'll end up finding well, right up\nthere at the top, Microsoft Access 2010.\n\n338\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.510\nAll right, so now that I select that,\nI can click on it one time and\n\n339\n00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.670\nthis is where it gets\na little bit scarier.\n\n340\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.980\nIn the past iterations\nof Microsoft Access,\n\n341\n00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.500\nit was never even this helpful, okay?\n\n342\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.890\nIf you take a look over here\non the right-hand side,\n\n343\n00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.570\nthe idea of a blank database.\n\n344\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.660\nIt just looks like\na single sheet of paper.\n\n345\n00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.710\nIt doesn't tend to help you at all, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.470\nBut the great thing is today they\nhave what they call different\n\n347\n00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.510\ntemplates that are available.\n\n348\n00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.910\nTo kind of say look, what we've done is\nwe went ahead and set up a structure for\n\n349\n00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.120\nyou just to be able to do this.\n\n350\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.500\nTo make sure that it's\nactually done fairly quickly.\n\n351\n00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.670\nSo that way they've set up\nthe structure but none of the data.\n\n352\n00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:02.360\nSo you can go in here and\nyou can pick different types of templates.\n\n353\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.420\nSo if you know that you're\ngonna be tracking assets,\n\n354\n00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.840\nyou simply click on Assets and it shows\nyou you can do inventory, home inventory.\n\n355\n00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.640\nAsset Tracking, Lending Library.\n\n356\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.740\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; You name it, they've gone ahead and\n\n357\n00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.880\nset this up.\n\n358\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.150\nIssues as well.\n\n359\n00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.671\nSo you can actually create address books,\nfacts covers.\n\n360\n00:19:18.671 --> 00:19:19.287\n&gt;&gt; Budgets.\n\n361\n00:19:19.287 --> 00:19:20.529\n&gt;&gt; You name it, budgets.\n\n362\n00:19:20.529 --> 00:19:21.990\nIt also helps as well.\n\n363\n00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.160\nOops, let me go back\nout a little bit more.\n\n364\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.980\nAnd so you can see where they've done as\nnon-profits and they even have more and\n\n365\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.630\nmore of this available, okay.\n\n366\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.990\nSo the more that I click on it,\nthe longer it stayed connected,\n\n367\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.140\nthe more it pulled up instead of what was\nthe default that was available there.\n\n368\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.430\nSo it gives you that ability to start\neven without understanding it, but\n\n369\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.000\nif you don't understand the principles.\n\n370\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.460\nIt doesn't matter where you start because\nit's not gonna make sense of why you would\n\n371\n00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.990\nenter what you would enter in here.\n\n372\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.930\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\njust start with this blank database.\n\n373\n00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.440\nNow before I do so,\nwe're gonna create a database.\n\n374\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.240\nSo, the information that I need is\nover here on the lower right-hand\n\n375\n00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.400\ncorner of the screen where\nmy head is covering up.\n\n376\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.010\nSo what we do is we begin by\ncreating a database first.\n\n377\n00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.624\nNow it sounds strange, but\nthat's what we're gonna do,\n\n378\n00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.920\nso this one is gonna be Gift Tracker.\n\n379\n00:20:15.132 --> 00:20:16.560\nGiftTrackingDB.\n\n380\n00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.445\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, I notice that you're not\nusing, you're emitting those spaces.\n\n381\n00:20:22.445 --> 00:20:23.840\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And is that because\n\n382\n00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.902\nmoving forward if anyone\nwants to use that title and\n\n383\n00:20:26.902 --> 00:20:30.290\npre-scripting language, it might\ncause problems further down the road?\n\n384\n00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:36.100\n&gt;&gt; Problem is kind of the key here,\nright, the very fact is databases tend to\n\n385\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:41.600\nnot like spaces because they don't\nknow what to do with the rest of it.\n\n386\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.660\nSo usually if you use spaces on\nside of database programs and\n\n387\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.090\neveryone can be different.\n\n388\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.630\nBut it might mean you have that codes\naround the name or you might have to add\n\n389\n00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.710\nan single quotes or you have to put them\nin brackets or whatever it might be.\n\n390\n00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.580\nSo instead, I just kind of eliminate the,\n&gt;&gt; As a best practice.\n\n391\n00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the idea of those spaces by just\nkeeping the name as close as possible.\n\n392\n00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.212\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; If I need to see spaces,\n\n393\n00:21:02.212 --> 00:21:04.850\nI'll use an underscore instead, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.450\nAt the very beginning, let's go ahead and\n\n395\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.320\ncreate that simple table that\nwe were talking about here.\n\n396\n00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.530\nAnd notice right away,\n\n397\n00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.900\nit still doesn't look very intuitive\nat the way that we do this, okay.\n\n398\n00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.750\nSo at this point if I go ahead and\nclick Create instead, I can now\n\n399\n00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.750\nselect Table and notice it goes ahead and\nactually creates another table for me.\n\n400\n00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.860\nI know I'm actually\ngonna need three tables,\n\n401\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.671\nso I'm just gonna go ahead and create all\nthree of them right here at the beginning.\n\n402\n00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:35.100\nNow I haven't added in anything, but\nnow notice I have three different tabs and\n\n403\n00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.800\nit's beginning to look a lot like\nExcel is what we're seeing, okay?\n\n404\n00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.560\nNow this is where it's different than\nthe way it actually works in Excel,\n\n405\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.780\nlet me go and click back on table one.\n\n406\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.659\nThe first thing I'm gonna do is rename\nthis thing and this one, well, it is open,\n\n407\n00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:52.780\nright, so I need to close that\none out if I'm gonna do that.\n\n408\n00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.670\nSo let me close that one out here.\n\n409\n00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.640\nActually, it doesn't matter\ncuz if I close them all out,\n\n410\n00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.170\nI don't have any tables left.\n\n411\n00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.170\nSo that's not gonna work.\n\n412\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.170\nSo let me go ahead and click Table and\n\n413\n00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.440\nthen let's start off here by\nactually entering in some data.\n\n414\n00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:10.140\nSo instead, I'm going to right-click\non this and go to Design View, okay?\n\n415\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.670\nNow it's gonna ask me for a table name.\n\n416\n00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.537\nThat's what it's looking for\nand this one was our tbl and\n\n417\n00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:22.639\nthis was gonna be ITProTV and I think\nthat said List if I remember right.\n\n418\n00:22:22.639 --> 00:22:27.040\nHave to check my diagram here.\n\n419\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.200\nYep, ITProTV list.\n\n420\n00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.960\nThen click OK and\nnow notice everything changes.\n\n421\n00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.620\nAnd all we're doing is we're\nactually creating different columns\n\n422\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.240\nacross a regular table,\nis what we're doing here.\n\n423\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.380\nSo in my column of information,\nI'm looking for first name, last name,\n\n424\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.700\nand employee id.\n\n425\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.190\nSo I should remember all that but\nI didn't, okay.\n\n426\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:52.610\nSo in that ID field here,\nI can generate a number or\n\n427\n00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.010\nI can just go ahead and\nmake it a number that I'm going to do.\n\n428\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.730\nI'm just gonna enter in my own number or\nI can tell Excel do it, not Excel, Access.\n\n429\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.640\nAccess would generate a very unique ID\njust like a serial number inside of this\n\n430\n00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.750\ntable here, so\nevery single record will be unique.\n\n431\n00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.520\nFor me, I'm just gonna type it in because\nI already have those numbers, all right.\n\n432\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.620\nSo once I select that,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n433\n00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.824\nAnd of course, you can actually add in\n\n434\n00:23:16.824 --> 00:23:18.830\na description there to\ntell you what it's about.\n\n435\n00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.630\nAnd then I had first name.\n\n436\n00:23:22.973 --> 00:23:25.380\nAnd so for this one,\nit's just gonna be text.\n\n437\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.210\nNow there's different data types and\nwe're just going to type again.\n\n438\n00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.500\nSo we're gonna call text.\n\n439\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.950\nAnd I have last name.\n\n440\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.280\nAnd I'm just gonna do initials here.\n\n441\n00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.130\nAll right, so\n\n442\n00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:40.260\nthat pretty much is the basic thing\nthat we actually have to get in there.\n\n443\n00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.260\nNow you saw here at the bottom\nof the screen though,\n\n444\n00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.870\nthere's a lot more values down here to\nwhere you can control everything about\n\n445\n00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.830\nwhat size data can be entered in.\n\n446\n00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.100\nBut we're really not gonna\nget into it that deeply.\n\n447\n00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.130\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you for\nstarting us on this wonderful journey and\n\n448\n00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.250\nwe do have more access headed your way.\n\n449\n00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.630\nBut I think that about wraps it up for\nthis episode.\n\n450\n00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.580\nSo stay tuned, get comfortable.\n\n451\n00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.980\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis episode as your host.\n\n452\n00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.820\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n453\n00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.660\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n454\n00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:15.638\n[MUSIC]\n\n455\n00:24:15.638 --> 00:24:20.294\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:04.825\n&gt;&gt; Live from San Francisco-\n\n4\n00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:07.668\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:11.965\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:15.378\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\nIC3 Key Application show.\n\n7\n00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:18.360\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.620\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at Microsoft Access 2010.\n\n9\n00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.400\nWith us today in studios,\nwe have Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.050\nThank you for joining us Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.240\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back as\nwe continue on with some Microsoft Access.\n\n12\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.192\nNow we're just gonna pick up where\nwe left off in our last episode.\n\n13\n00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:37.830\nWe had just simply created a table, and\n\n14\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.740\nnow we need to think about\ndoing some data entry.\n\n15\n00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.280\nSo let me go and\nshow you what we're talking about here.\n\n16\n00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.480\nSo on my screen, I just finished typing\nin these field names and if you remember\n\n17\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.880\nI mentioned the term, Field in the last\nepisode, in the previous episode here.\n\n18\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.170\nWhere I said that that's the same and\n\n19\n00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.050\nequivalent as what you see in columns if\nyou were to take a look at a spreadsheet.\n\n20\n00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.020\nSo once we actually had those created we\nwere fine because now we're actually ready\n\n21\n00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.540\nto take data and enter that data in.\n\n22\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.180\nThere is one special field though and\n\n23\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.380\nit's actually noted by inside of access\nwith this little key that you see.\n\n24\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.800\nThat key in the case, was called\na primary key field, and one thing that,\n\n25\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.076\nthat mean, is that it ensures that\nevery single record that I enter in,\n\n26\n00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:22.459\nis going to be unique.\n\n27\n00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:26.848\nAnd this is gonna be true, regardless of\nhow many people end up at least with this\n\n28\n00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:30.820\nparticular database,\nwith the first name and the last name.\n\n29\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.680\nSo even if there were five or\n\n30\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.770\nsix Ronnie Wong's that we entered in here,\nit wouldn't really matter,\n\n31\n00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.560\nbecause as long as I actually have\nthat employee ID that makes it unique,\n\n32\n00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.280\nthen we can actually continue to\nkeep track of those things as well.\n\n33\n00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.610\nNow, once I actually did that during\nour little break here, I went ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.150\nI also created the other data, and went\nahead and populated that data as well.\n\n35\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.780\nNow this particular table we have yet\nto populate the data.\n\n36\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.390\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n37\n00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.010\nIf I switch on over to the tabular\nview that you see right here,\n\n38\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.230\nyou actually notice that there's\nno information in it at all.\n\n39\n00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.650\nSo I wanna make sure I\npopulate data right here too.\n\n40\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.190\n&gt;&gt; And\nRonnie what does this term populate mean?\n\n41\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.870\nIs that just another term for input?\n\n42\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.530\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nIt is another term for\n\n43\n00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.320\ninputting the data inside of these tables.\n\n44\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.690\nNow, there is a problem that comes about\nespecially with data entry in real life,\n\n45\n00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.420\nthat is, as you're working.\n\n46\n00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.070\nIs that most of us are not\ngoing to know exactly what to\n\n47\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.030\npopulate in from forms that were handed or\nanything else.\n\n48\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.730\nSo they might not know exactly what to\nput in and exactly where to put it in, or\n\n49\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.140\neven the format to put it into.\n\n50\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.890\nSo if I were to allow somebody to\nopen this up directly they would have\n\n51\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.060\naccess not only to this table, but they\nwould have access to the entire database.\n\n52\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.120\nSo instead, the normal way to do data\nentry inside of something like Access is\n\n53\n00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.050\nto use what we call a form instead.\n\n54\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.500\nA form essentially just says,\nhere are the fields I'm looking for, so\n\n55\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.710\nplease just add in that\nparticular type of information.\n\n56\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.240\nSo if you're handed a form,\nyou just simply look for that.\n\n57\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.310\nNow we can actually create\nforms that look exactly\n\n58\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.330\nlike a form that were handed or\nwe can create a very generic form.\n\n59\n00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.740\nToday we're gonna create\na fairly generic form.\n\n60\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.200\nSo, I'm gonna create a form,\nshow you how to create a form.\n\n61\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.340\nSo that you can see how\ndata gets entered in here.\n\n62\n00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.120\nSo the way that I do that,\nis I can go to create up here, on the tab.\n\n63\n00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.550\nAnd once I'm actually inside of Create,\nthen in the Forms grouping,\n\n64\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.800\nthat you see, I'm gonna use\nwhat's called the Form Wizard.\n\n65\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.106\nSo instead of me having to try and figure\nout all the stuff that I need, it's simply\n\n66\n00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:47.580\ngoing to say, hey, here's the simple\nthings that you need to create this form.\n\n67\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.620\nLet's go ahead and use that, as well.\n\n68\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.590\nSo I select the Forms wizard and\nthe key aspect of this of course is first,\n\n69\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.040\nto choose the table that I want to be\nable to, well, do data input into.\n\n70\n00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.650\nSo it's gonna be this one right here,\n\n71\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.960\nwhich is going to be of\ncourse the ITProTV list.\n\n72\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.380\nAnd then it's gonna ask me to select\nthe fields that I wanna populate in there.\n\n73\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.780\nSo if I had more than just the three\nthat you see right here, and\n\n74\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.050\nI really didn't want everything\nto be entered in at this time,\n\n75\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.060\nI could only pick one or two if I wanted.\n\n76\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.750\nSo it's that simple,\nI can actually add that in there.\n\n77\n00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.450\nI don't want that anymore, I just simply\nuse the left arrow and that puts it back.\n\n78\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.630\nIf I want to add in all of them, I used\na double arrow and that actually says, all\n\n79\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.610\nright, here's the fields that you're going\nto be able to do some data entry into.\n\n80\n00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.620\nOnce I select there I can click Next and\nthen this gonna ask me what\n\n81\n00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.730\nthis form design is really going to\nlook like for what you're seeing.\n\n82\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.230\nWe can have it just look almost exactly\nlike what would I just showed you.\n\n83\n00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.150\nWhich was just a blank column format.\n\n84\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.790\nWe can do it in a table style,\n\n85\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.210\nwhere it actually just shows\nus all the information.\n\n86\n00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.350\nWe can do this idea of a data sheet or\njustified.\n\n87\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.450\nYou name it, we can pick any of these.\n\n88\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.341\nSo at this point, I'm simply going to pick\nthe idea of, I think, I'll pick tabular,\n\n89\n00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:08.500\nis what I'm going to pick.\n\n90\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.520\nAnd then click Next, and once I do this\nit's gonna ask me what I want to do,\n\n91\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.950\ndo I want to modify it,\ndo I want to do anything else?\n\n92\n00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.020\nI'm just gonna open the form to view or\nto enter information and\n\n93\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.630\nclick Finish and now you'll be able to\nsee, I created just a very simple form\n\n94\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.810\nright here so\nthat now I can begin my data entry.\n\n95\n00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.940\nSo if we remember we were taking,\n\n96\n00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.460\nwe're actually taking the information that\nwe see over here on the left hand side and\n\n97\n00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.710\nmine's just a little bit\nwider than what we have.\n\n98\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.870\nI'm taking this table\ninformation right here and\n\n99\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.980\nentering it into the form,\nis what I'm going to do.\n\n100\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.290\nSo as I start to type in information.\n\n101\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.760\nHopefully I get the revised name right.\n\n102\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.920\nI'm just gonna use the last name, or\nthe first initial of the last name.\n\n103\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.590\nAnd, do this.\n\n104\n00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.200\nTitus.\n\n105\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.910\nAnd then there's Megan,\nand this is gonna be,\n\n106\n00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.729\nmake sure I enter this in right,\nbecause I don't want to get it wrong here.\n\n107\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.541\nAnd it says.\n\n108\n00:06:09.263 --> 00:06:11.678\nAnd then we have Taylor.\n\n109\n00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:18.900\nAnd then Cherokee.\n\n110\n00:06:22.603 --> 00:06:27.350\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie in a previous episode we\nwere taking a look at Microsoft Excel.\n\n111\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.510\nAnd we were able to start lists and\n\n112\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.440\nthen have the software intuitively\nfinish or fill up the rest of that list.\n\n113\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.020\nDo we see anything like that\nhere with these tables?\n\n114\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, you'll see some of it, but\nnot on the way that you want to.\n\n115\n00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.420\nSo, its not gonna populate\nthings like series of lists.\n\n116\n00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.580\nJust automatically, because that's\nnot what it is designed to do.\n\n117\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.390\nThe idea of us having a database form,\n\n118\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.490\nis that we really need the data populated\nindividually, for every single record.\n\n119\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.360\nBecause that's kind of the key element\nthat we're really looking for, is the idea\n\n120\n00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.490\nof a unique record combined together\nwith multiple tables if we need to.\n\n121\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.380\nSo we won't see the idea of a series fill\nin anything like that inside of Access.\n\n122\n00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.590\nNow, now that I've got this\nentered in here it doesn't look\n\n123\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.010\nlike it's done anything,\nwell let's verify and check that.\n\n124\n00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.560\nSo if I now click on the ITProTV list.\n\n125\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.760\nSo this is the data, that's where\nthat form entering the data in,\n\n126\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.340\nshould now actually end up\nappearing in here, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.340\nBut I don't really see that happening.\n\n128\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.170\nAnd the reason I don't see that, is\nbecause everything is still stored right\n\n129\n00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.690\nhere in the memory of the computer,\non this form, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.870\nSo, in this particular type of form,\n\n131\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.610\nwhat I need to do is go ahead and\nI need to refresh all, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.980\nNow, once I refresh all,\nif everything is done right.\n\n133\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.803\nIn other words, I didn't mess up.\n\n134\n00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:53.603\nIf I messed up, it's not going to be here.\n\n135\n00:07:53.603 --> 00:07:55.806\nThen I click on the ITProTV list.\n\n136\n00:07:55.806 --> 00:07:57.961\nIt looks like it says, hey,\nyou didn't do this right.\n\n137\n00:07:57.961 --> 00:08:02.648\nSo what I need to do is find that\nRefresh button again once I'm here\n\n138\n00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:07.440\nWe're actually have to wait just\na moment and that is the key here.\n\n139\n00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.440\nCuz sometimes just waiting is\nactually what has to happen.\n\n140\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.830\n&gt;&gt; Happens a lot in IT.\n\n141\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.954\n&gt;&gt; It really does, you have to kind of\nbe able to just give it a moment or two,\n\n142\n00:08:17.954 --> 00:08:22.742\nand make sure that I'm actually in\nhere on the forms that I need, and\n\n143\n00:08:22.742 --> 00:08:27.868\nthen try again to refresh everything,\nand then see what happens again.\n\n144\n00:08:33.485 --> 00:08:36.783\nAll right so,\nwe'll just kind of give it a moment or\n\n145\n00:08:36.783 --> 00:08:39.450\ntwo and see what ends up happening.\n\n146\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.630\nAnd the more that I click around,\n\n147\n00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.390\nthe more that I start to do things like\nthis, I'm more than likely to mess it up.\n\n148\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.970\nBut usually once you kind of have\nit where you need it, there we go.\n\n149\n00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.460\nSee, it just took a moment.\n\n150\n00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.171\nSo at this point sometimes you're asked\nwhat you're having to do is just wait.\n\n151\n00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:54.945\nNow you're probably saying,\nwhy did you have to wait?\n\n152\n00:08:54.945 --> 00:08:56.442\nI don't know at this point.\n\n153\n00:08:56.442 --> 00:08:58.515\nIt could be that my machine was busy.\n\n154\n00:08:58.515 --> 00:09:00.962\nIt could be something else was\ngoing on in the background.\n\n155\n00:09:00.962 --> 00:09:02.802\nBut it did end up working.\n\n156\n00:09:02.802 --> 00:09:06.790\nAnd I was just trying to see if I was\nmissing anything else before I said, yeah,\n\n157\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.490\nsomething is broken here.\n\n158\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.630\nBut you just saw, it just took a few\nmore seconds and just waiting.\n\n159\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.890\nIt was now able to populate\nthe data directly in there.\n\n160\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.880\nSo this really does help the majority\nof the times when you're actually\n\n161\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.240\nasked to work inside of the database\nespecially for data entry.\n\n162\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.404\nMore than likely it's gonna be something\nlike this, as a form that is populated.\n\n163\n00:09:27.404 --> 00:09:29.388\nAnd It may actually populate or\n\n164\n00:09:29.388 --> 00:09:34.119\nmay actually be able to do data input\namong multiple tables instead of just\n\n165\n00:09:34.119 --> 00:09:37.957\nthe one, because I went ahead and\nfilled in the other ones.\n\n166\n00:09:37.957 --> 00:09:41.815\nWe didn't have to worry about that and\nthat's all due to the idea of time\n\n167\n00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:46.410\nconstrain for our shows, but you can\nactually see how that works for you.\n\n168\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.260\nSo now that you are actually able to do\nthat, you might find out that they have\n\n169\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.700\na form, that at the bottom\nthey put a button there.\n\n170\n00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.888\nSo you can take the time, you can actually\nhave a button where it says submit.\n\n171\n00:09:56.888 --> 00:10:00.483\nI could actually have clicked on one\nof them and actually pressed the button\n\n172\n00:10:00.483 --> 00:10:04.148\nsubmit, and that would have made it then\ndo that refresh all just like I had.\n\n173\n00:10:04.148 --> 00:10:07.381\nAnd it may just take a moment\nbefore that populates too, but\n\n174\n00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:11.714\nyou as someone doing data entry, you\nwould never normally see what's actually\n\n175\n00:10:11.714 --> 00:10:15.990\nhappening in the background, and\nthat's what we're showing you.\n\n176\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.240\nSo entering in information in that\nform allowed me to populate this\n\n177\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.445\nwithout giving you access to the other two\ntables, is what we also see there too.\n\n178\n00:10:24.445 --> 00:10:29.915\nNow, now that we have the data\npopulating all three of those tables.\n\n179\n00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:34.147\nSo remember I said at the beginning of\nthis episode during our break in between\n\n180\n00:10:34.147 --> 00:10:38.247\nthe first and second episode, I also\nwent ahead and just added in the data in\n\n181\n00:10:38.247 --> 00:10:42.990\nhere cuz I showed you how to actually do\nit here same principle is what we see.\n\n182\n00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.540\nNow I have three different tables just\nlike what I was showing you here.\n\n183\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.180\nNow the key that we have to be able\nto do Is because I don't want to\n\n184\n00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.330\ndo this manually like the way that I made\nCherokee do this in the first episode.\n\n185\n00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.390\nWhich was not only to fill\nthe data in here, but\n\n186\n00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:04.550\nthen I said, this column right here,\nmatches up to this column.\n\n187\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.779\nAnd then this column\nmatches up to this column.\n\n188\n00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:07.490\nAnd that's fine.\n\n189\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.270\nThat's what we want, is that those\ncolumns actually end up matching up.\n\n190\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.564\nCherokee was able to show us by picking\none name, such as her own name.\n\n191\n00:11:15.564 --> 00:11:19.525\nShe can find the number here,\nwhich is 1100, and\n\n192\n00:11:19.525 --> 00:11:25.875\nthen she can go over here to 011, and she\ncan go through the entire prize list here.\n\n193\n00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:26.725\nAnd then there it is,\n\n194\n00:11:26.725 --> 00:11:29.810\nshe actually ended up with Gourmet\nCupcakes cuz that's the way she cheated.\n\n195\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.801\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n[LAUGH]\n\n196\n00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:31.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n197\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.504\nOkay so that's the way we can do this in\nour own heads by following the way that\n\n198\n00:11:36.504 --> 00:11:39.030\nwe show that connection.\n\n199\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.840\nSo how do I get this connection,\n\n200\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.890\nthat type of relationship to show up\nbetween those tables in Access, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.800\nThat's what we need to do.\n\n202\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.350\nSo if everything matches up, what I need\nto do is I need to connect this table,\n\n203\n00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.200\non this field to that match up table and\nI need to connect\n\n204\n00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.680\nthe prize table here in this particular\nfield to the one in match up.\n\n205\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.950\nAnd will form that link relationship and\nthat's what we're looking to do next.\n\n206\n00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:14.806\nSo if we're building a very simple\ndatabase at this point in time,\n\n207\n00:12:14.806 --> 00:12:19.527\nI would go to Database Tools,\nright here on that tab.\n\n208\n00:12:19.527 --> 00:12:22.914\nAnd inside of Database Tools I'm\nlooking for, look at that,\n\n209\n00:12:22.914 --> 00:12:25.160\nthat actually says Relationships.\n\n210\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.540\nDefines how data in tables is related,\nsuch as ID fields or\n\n211\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.810\nfields and names in different tables,\nhow they should match up.\n\n212\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:37.266\nSo I'm going to zoom out just for\na moment and click here.\n\n213\n00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:42.380\nAnd now it's saying, hey, what tables\nwould you like to try and link up?\n\n214\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.350\nI click Add.\n\n215\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.340\nAnd then I can select the next table and\nclick Add, select the next table and\n\n216\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.020\nclick Add.\n\n217\n00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.564\nSo now I have these three tables.\n\n218\n00:12:58.702 --> 00:13:00.721\nThat I can populate in here.\n\n219\n00:13:03.308 --> 00:13:07.240\nAnd then, for\nme to link this up is fairly simple.\n\n220\n00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.080\nI normally select that field that\nI want to link on, click and\n\n221\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.610\nI drag over, and directly right on\ntop of that same field over here,\n\n222\n00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.200\nI can link that up and click Create.\n\n223\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.770\nNow there's a whole bunch of\nother questions here that you can\n\n224\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.650\nanswer by checking, we're not really\ngetting that deep into this at this point.\n\n225\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.160\nBut it does help when you\ndo some of these things.\n\n226\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.600\nFor right now, we just wanna\nshow a basic relationship and\n\n227\n00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.439\nhere's another thing that you'll end up\nlearning about later on as you start to\n\n228\n00:13:38.439 --> 00:13:43.020\nget deeper into the idea of\nDatabase Relationships here.\n\n229\n00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.470\nIs they say that is\na one-to-many relationship.\n\n230\n00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.140\nAnd what that is actually saying is\nthat this one primary key over here, so\n\n231\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.300\nCherokee's ID, or\nher particular employee ID,\n\n232\n00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.860\ncould possibly be linked to more\nthan one prize if we wanted to.\n\n233\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.980\nWe're not doing that today, but it is\npossible that it could be done that way.\n\n234\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.910\nSo then I'm gonna click Create and\nthat will form this line in between.\n\n235\n00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:13.070\nAnd then the same thing from\nthe PrizeID over to the PrizeID.\n\n236\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.570\nAnd I'm simply gonna click Create.\n\n237\n00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.310\nSo there is a lot more to go.\n\n238\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.450\nBut with three tables, that is plenty for\nus to deal with at this point.\n\n239\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.350\nSo now that I have this relationship,\n\n240\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.620\nwell not only can we do\nthe same thing logically,\n\n241\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:35.240\nwhere I can say hey, who ended up with\nthe gift of the Opus Coffee Gift?\n\n242\n00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.950\nWell now we can look up this PrizeID\nnumber, inside the matchup table,\n\n243\n00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.926\nand that actually goes here.\n\n244\n00:14:41.926 --> 00:14:46.050\nAnd then to 1011, and\nthen that actually is Taylor Austin.\n\n245\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.720\nSo, it actually does match up here, so\n\n246\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.430\nthat we can see where\nthe information can go both ways.\n\n247\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.180\nSo, if I come back here, I know that,\nthat relationship is set.\n\n248\n00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.330\nI can go ahead and close out of it.\n\n249\n00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.607\nRight now it says,\ndo I wanna save the changes?\n\n250\n00:15:00.607 --> 00:15:03.395\nI do, because what I'm\nsaying now is go ahead and\n\n251\n00:15:03.395 --> 00:15:06.050\ninside of the software application.\n\n252\n00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.620\nMake that link okay,\nnow that the links are made\n\n253\n00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.630\nthe two important aspects of what\nwe're doing here is kinda the key.\n\n254\n00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.030\nThe important aspects\nof this idea is simple.\n\n255\n00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.150\nNow I can generate a query and\n\n256\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:23.311\nthen from that query generate\na report is what we can do.\n\n257\n00:15:23.311 --> 00:15:28.250\nOkay, so this is where we can start doing\nsomething like this as well, right?\n\n258\n00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.390\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate the idea of a query.\n\n259\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.060\nNow if you're going like,\nwhat the heck is a query,\n\n260\n00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.070\nit's the question that you\nwant to ask of the database.\n\n261\n00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.020\nWhat is the information you\nwant out of this database?\n\n262\n00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.870\nSo then, we can do that, so\nI can come up here to the top and\n\n263\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.600\non that tab I'm gonna click Create.\n\n264\n00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.990\nSo once I select Create, notice that\nI have tables, templates, queries.\n\n265\n00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.892\nRight here, and this time we're\njust gonna use the Query Wizard.\n\n266\n00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:01.764\nNow the neat thing about this idea\nof the Query Wizard is that it\n\n267\n00:16:01.764 --> 00:16:04.321\nreally helps us if we don't\nknow how to do the queries.\n\n268\n00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:07.014\nWhy would I go through all this\nextra setup to go ahead and\n\n269\n00:16:07.014 --> 00:16:08.397\ngenerate a specific query?\n\n270\n00:16:08.397 --> 00:16:11.330\nIs this something that I would\nwanna be asking often, and\n\n271\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.896\nit actually helps in the long\nrun versus going in,\n\n272\n00:16:13.896 --> 00:16:17.516\ntyping that information every single\ntime I wanna ask that question?\n\n273\n00:16:17.516 --> 00:16:19.580\n&gt;&gt; The whole idea behind\nthe query is simple.\n\n274\n00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.655\nThat's the reason why you need a database.\n\n275\n00:16:21.655 --> 00:16:24.789\nQueries allow us to take\ntremendous amounts of data that\n\n276\n00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:27.724\nare connected in this\nrelational database design,\n\n277\n00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:32.370\nand be able to actually find exactly\nthe piece of information that we need.\n\n278\n00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.970\nNow with our little tiny\ndatabase that we have here,\n\n279\n00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.820\nright, I showed you how Cherokee could do,\neven I, I mean, that's how simple it is.\n\n280\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.020\nEven Ronnie Wong could do this without\nactually needing a relational database.\n\n281\n00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.980\nBut if these records where\nhundreds of employees.\n\n282\n00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.450\nIf we are tracking thousands of prizes\nhere that we are matching up for\n\n283\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.140\nChristmas, well now all of a sudden\nbecomes more challenging, okay.\n\n284\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.540\nSo a query allows us to be able to take\nthe power of the computers processing.\n\n285\n00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.890\nThe ability to actually run a question.\n\n286\n00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.260\nAnd pull out the information that I\nneed to show me exactly what I want.\n\n287\n00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.066\nEven across thousands, or\neven at times here hundreds of thousands,\n\n288\n00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:13.812\npossibly millions of records.\n\n289\n00:17:13.812 --> 00:17:15.500\nThat's why we want a query.\n\n290\n00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.003\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n291\n00:17:16.003 --> 00:17:20.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so but that is the key and\naspect of this.\n\n292\n00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.330\nNow the great thing is underneath this,\nright?\n\n293\n00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.130\nIn the background that's running.\n\n294\n00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.680\nIt's a special language there is\na special thing that we call a structured\n\n295\n00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.068\nquery language or sql that's\nactually running in the background.\n\n296\n00:17:32.068 --> 00:17:32.793\nMy gosh are we going to learn?\n\n297\n00:17:32.793 --> 00:17:34.420\nNo we're not doing that.\n\n298\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.730\nBut if you want to learn more about it\nthat's where the real power resides.\n\n299\n00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.160\nBecause it means you can change\nup your queries very quickly.\n\n300\n00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.058\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie would this be\nan intermediary type of database?\n\n301\n00:17:45.058 --> 00:17:48.019\nAnd then we've seen some\nreally cool things so far, but\n\n302\n00:17:48.019 --> 00:17:50.981\nat what point when I start\nexperiencing growing pains or\n\n303\n00:17:50.981 --> 00:17:54.650\nhow would I decide to move on\nto another type of database?\n\n304\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.890\n&gt;&gt; Well there of course comes limitations\nin what the database can do and\n\n305\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.140\nwhat it can't do.\n\n306\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.740\nSo the way that you actually\nunderstand that at times is that\n\n307\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.820\nif you come to this point\nin which multiple people\n\n308\n00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.920\nneed to connect into that\ndatabase at the same time.\n\n309\n00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.430\nThen this is not the tool for you.\n\n310\n00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n311\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.320\n&gt;&gt; If you're the only one doing\ndata entry for my company and then\n\n312\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.680\nI'm the only one generating the query that\nthen somebody else can print out a report.\n\n313\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.840\nIn other words, one at a time access.\n\n314\n00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.000\nThen access is the way to go.\n\n315\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.930\nSo is there a way that multiple\npeople can connect to it?\n\n316\n00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.990\nIn theory, yes, okay?\n\n317\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.570\nBut it does slow down quite a bit and\nif you actually need a high performance\n\n318\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:38.475\nenvironment, this is not going to be for\nyour enterprise to do so.\n\n319\n00:18:38.475 --> 00:18:42.450\nWhere you have ten people doing data\nentry onto the table at the same time.\n\n320\n00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.030\nOr hundreds of people doing it,\n\n321\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.846\nyou're going to go to a much\nbigger type of application.\n\n322\n00:18:46.846 --> 00:18:48.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But in a small company,\n\n323\n00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.680\nit probably will be sufficient.\n\n324\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.780\nOr just about anything that they\nneed if you're running your own shop\n\n325\n00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.450\nin which you're doing\nsmall inventory in retail,\n\n326\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.380\nit'll probably handle just\nabout everything fine.\n\n327\n00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.307\nEven to a medium sized company\nit'll probably be fine,\n\n328\n00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.925\nbut once the orders start\ncoming in where there's\n\n329\n00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:07.117\nten people trying to create orders and\ndoing all that stuff.\n\n330\n00:19:07.117 --> 00:19:11.166\nThen all of a sudden access gets a bit\noverwhelmed at who should actually get\n\n331\n00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:14.270\naccess to the data, and\nhow is that controlled.\n\n332\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.150\nThen at that point, you've got to\nrealize that that's gonna be beyond us.\n\n333\n00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.930\nBut for most of us, this is gonna be fine.\n\n334\n00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.500\nSo let's go ahead and create the simple\nquery, as we were talking about here.\n\n335\n00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.990\nSo I pulled up this idea\nof the query wizard.\n\n336\n00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.790\nSo I'm simply gonna select a simple query.\n\n337\n00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.620\nNow, there's multiple\ndifferent types of queries.\n\n338\n00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.933\nEach one of these is actually\na little bit more pre defined.\n\n339\n00:19:33.933 --> 00:19:36.694\nIn other words, I've said,\nwe're gonna define the fields for\n\n340\n00:19:36.694 --> 00:19:38.030\nyou to do some of these things.\n\n341\n00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.540\nCross tab, duplicates, and\nunmatch queries, as well.\n\n342\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.470\nUsually duplicates indicate that\nyou might think that there's\n\n343\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.820\nerrors inside your database.\n\n344\n00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.221\nDue to duplication of data entry.\n\n345\n00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:52.102\nSo If Cherokee and\nI enter in the exact record twice, and\n\n346\n00:19:52.102 --> 00:19:56.720\nwe think that's possible, I might go\nthrough there and look for a duplicate.\n\n347\n00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.250\nThe idea of unmatched normally\nmeans that for one reason or\n\n348\n00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.390\nanother a record is not being found.\n\n349\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.570\nSo this gives me the ability\nto find a record\n\n350\n00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.730\nthat isn't found by any other\nqueries that I'm really looking for.\n\n351\n00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.860\nAnd that can indicate a problem as well,\nbecause one of those little boxes I\n\n352\n00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.480\ndidn't check when I created that\nrelationship called referential integrity.\n\n353\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.780\nSo normally that means we end up with\nwhat we call orphaned records, or\n\n354\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.620\nthe idea of, actually orphaned\nrecords is kind of the big one there.\n\n355\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.110\nOr what they call, of course,\nwhy can't I remember the other term?\n\n356\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.040\nBut orphan records is usually the term.\n\n357\n00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.859\nThere's usually two terms\nassociated with that but\n\n358\n00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.983\nit's called widowed records as well.\n\n359\n00:20:36.983 --> 00:20:38.177\nSo that's what we have.\n\n360\n00:20:38.177 --> 00:20:41.210\nSo I was trying to remember those\ntwo terms, orphaned and widowed.\n\n361\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.390\nIt doesn't sound great but\n\n362\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.810\nan orphan record is when you can't\nrun a query against everything else.\n\n363\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:47.659\nAnd pull the data out.\n\n364\n00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:49.760\nIn order words, you know that\nthere's another record in there.\n\n365\n00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.600\nIt's just not gonna happen.\n\n366\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.400\nSo that's what's actually\ngonna end up happening.\n\n367\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.170\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate this one for right now.\n\n368\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:01.570\nAnd once I do that,\nI can now select a bunch of things, right?\n\n369\n00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.112\nSo I want to be able to to go ahead and\n\n370\n00:21:05.112 --> 00:21:10.368\nI'm going to pull in this table and\nalso this one and\n\n371\n00:21:10.368 --> 00:21:17.588\nlet me see I just need the prize\nhere as well I'm gonna query that.\n\n372\n00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:20.300\nSo I wanna be able to find\nout the employees name and\n\n373\n00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.480\nthe prize to be able to query from okay.\n\n374\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.820\nSo I don't even need this employee\nid over there if I don't want to.\n\n375\n00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.350\nClick next and now it says hey,\nwhat level of detail?\n\n376\n00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:35.910\nI'm just gonna say hey, show me everything\nfor right now and then click Next.\n\n377\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.773\nAnd then it's gonna say the query list or\nprize.\n\n378\n00:21:42.288 --> 00:21:47.850\nPrizes, and now I'm gonna click Finish.\n\n379\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.191\nAnd you can see the result right away.\n\n380\n00:21:51.191 --> 00:21:56.377\nNow, notice that without us\nhaving to do much more than this,\n\n381\n00:21:56.377 --> 00:22:02.076\nI can see that it's Peter, and\nhe has the lunch at a local eatery.\n\n382\n00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:03.988\nTitus two movie tickets here,\n\n383\n00:22:03.988 --> 00:22:07.968\nMeagan got the car wash with\nthe extra scent that this provided.\n\n384\n00:22:07.968 --> 00:22:08.509\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n385\n00:22:08.509 --> 00:22:10.516\n&gt;&gt; Taylor with the Opus gift card here.\n\n386\n00:22:10.516 --> 00:22:12.347\nCherokee, with gourmet cupcakes.\n\n387\n00:22:12.347 --> 00:22:14.842\nAnd Ronnie with the 24\ninch pie which I love.\n\n388\n00:22:14.842 --> 00:22:17.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right up my ally here.\n\n389\n00:22:17.244 --> 00:22:21.945\nBut we can see where that's where you can\npull a bunch of information together.\n\n390\n00:22:21.945 --> 00:22:23.850\nNow we showed everything.\n\n391\n00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:28.080\nBut the true power behind the query is to\nfilter out only what you actually need.\n\n392\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.580\nSo just kind of realize that\nis at least some of it.\n\n393\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.520\nNow, the problem that we has is\nnobody actually likes data that way.\n\n394\n00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.076\nAnd we still need to create\nthe idea of a report, but\n\n395\n00:22:39.076 --> 00:22:40.808\nthat takes a little bit more time.\n\n396\n00:22:40.808 --> 00:22:43.620\nAnd I think we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n397\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.816\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think that about does it Ronnie,\n\n398\n00:22:45.816 --> 00:22:50.345\nwe were able to look at those tables and\nlearn how to create those relationships,\n\n399\n00:22:50.345 --> 00:22:54.166\nand automate our workforce becoming\nessentially more efficient.\n\n400\n00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:57.561\nSo I appreciate that, and\nI appreciate you for tuning in, but\n\n401\n00:22:57.561 --> 00:23:00.990\nstay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n402\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.889\nFor this episode, I'm gonna sign\noff as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n403\n00:23:03.889 --> 00:23:04.727\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n404\n00:23:04.727 --> 00:23:06.796\n&gt;&gt; See you next time at

00:00:17.940\nCherokee Bouse.\n\n4\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.974\nIn this episode we will go ahead and\n\n5\n00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:24.476\ntake a look at how to generate\ninformation from Microsoft Access 2010.\n\n6\n00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:27.724\nIn the past couple of episodes we've\nbeen looking at how to create and\n\n7\n00:00:27.724 --> 00:00:31.430\ninput information, but now we're gonna\nlook at the other end of things here.\n\n8\n00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.119\nSo, we have Ronnie Wong in studio with\nus today to help us take a look at this\n\n9\n00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:36.440\ninformation.\n\n10\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.600\nAll right, well Cherokee,\n\n11\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.380\nwe're actually just going to pick up where\nwe left off for Microsoft Access and\n\n12\n00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.850\nmaking sure that we understand kind of\nthe full gamut of what we're going to do.\n\n13\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.350\nWe have already talked about the idea here\nof course of creating the basic structure\n\n14\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.440\nof the database.\n\n15\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.680\nWe also populated each of those\ndifferent tables with some data.\n\n16\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.110\nWe also showed you how to create a query.\n\n17\n00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.105\nAnd the query is where we picked up,\nso let's go ahead and take a look and\n\n18\n00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:02.000\nsee this query again.\n\n19\n00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.820\nSo I just used the actual Query Wizard\nhere to allow me to go ahead and\n\n20\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.740\ncreate this particular result.\n\n21\n00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.450\nNow, remember that a query is just me\nasking questions of the database and\n\n22\n00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.340\nsaying what fields do I expect to see.\n\n23\n00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.920\nNow, even though we can create this and\n\n24\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.530\nthis shows us everything, showing us\neverything is almost equal to showing us\n\n25\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.920\nnothing because even though\nit displays everything,\n\n26\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.520\nit still doesn't mean I'm actually\nfinding the exact data that I need.\n\n27\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.490\nIt's one of the actual menu\nrecords that are in there, but\n\n28\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.320\nit still means that I need to\ngo in there and find some more.\n\n29\n00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.240\nSo, what we can do, is we can modify this\nquery just a little bit to help us and\n\n30\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.810\nto actually be able to use\na little bit of filtering.\n\n31\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.740\nSo, the way we do that is not that\nI have this query right here and\n\n32\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.890\nhere is the results of what\nI actually pulled out,\n\n33\n00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.210\nwhich is every single of the record of\nthe nation that I want to display here.\n\n34\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.560\nI can now click on the query design.\n\n35\n00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.280\nAnd now, once I have that,\nI can add in, and\n\n36\n00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.790\nI'm just gonna go head and add in all the\ntables and this linking relationship here.\n\n37\n00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.420\nSo that we can see this and now I can\nactually change that query up if I\n\n38\n00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.230\nwant to, so we can go ahead and\nfilter this out as well.\n\n39\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.880\nNow, the nice thing is that, I can\nactually go to first name, last name, and\n\n40\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.130\nemployee ID, and then select the price.\n\n41\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.011\nSo, if I want to do something like this,\n\n42\n00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:34.978\nthe other thing that I can do is if you'll\ntake a note down here at the bottom, and\n\n43\n00:02:34.978 --> 00:02:38.187\nwe'll kinda look at the side\nhere in just a moment.\n\n44\n00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:42.540\nLet me see if I can expand this out, so we\ndon't have to do too much shifting around.\n\n45\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.820\nIs I'm gonna zoom in, and\n\n46\n00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.310\nnow notice that there is this\nfield called Criteria right here.\n\n47\n00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.440\nWell, Criteria is the same as a filter.\n\n48\n00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.056\nSo, if I now go to the employee ID and\nI want to select out,\n\n49\n00:02:58.056 --> 00:03:02.970\nlet's say Megan here,\nI just simply type in her ID\n\n50\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.360\nnumber in that Criteria field,\nand then I select run.\n\n51\n00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.058\nAnd now notice we're it actually just\nleft me with just Megan's record that it\n\n52\n00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:17.686\ndisplayed, so instead of me having\na thousand records or a hundred records,\n\n53\n00:03:17.686 --> 00:03:20.910\nif I only need to display one,\nwe can do that.\n\n54\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.790\nAs long as we know what's\nin that field that we need,\n\n55\n00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.350\nwe can actually use access to help us.\n\n56\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.673\nThere are a lot of times even\ninside of big, gigantic databases,\n\n57\n00:03:30.673 --> 00:03:35.939\nthat what you can do with accesses even\nif you don't create an access database,\n\n58\n00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.826\nyou can use this query function to pull\nin the information where you need.\n\n59\n00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:44.868\nAnd then add in those filters\njust like what we showed you, and\n\n60\n00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:49.612\nbecause access is really using this to\nbuild a type out the actual command\n\n61\n00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:52.650\nInside that structure query language.\n\n62\n00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.820\nIt can run against a very big database and\ndisplay information right her for\n\n63\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.900\nyou instead, making the query a lot\nmore user friendly someone you like me\n\n64\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.140\ncan actually take a big gigantic database\nand work with it in this way as well.\n\n65\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.530\nSo making it as much more intuitive\nthen learning that structured query\n\n66\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.190\nlanguage in step.\n\n67\n00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.940\nSo, I'm not against learning it,\nI believe that if\n\n68\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.610\nyou're gonna head down the database\ntrack you absolutely should but\n\n69\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.790\nat some point here this is\nwhat you might be able to.\n\n70\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.580\nSo the ability to do something like\nthis is actually a very key aspect\n\n71\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.840\nof what we can do.\n\n72\n00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.080\nThe great thing is queries are never\nexactly permanent, so I can just say hey,\n\n73\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.150\nI don't want this query.\n\n74\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.810\nBut if I knew I was gonna run\nthat again later I would save it.\n\n75\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.710\nAnd then all I have to do, is over here\non the left hand side, so just like for\n\n76\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.360\nthis one, I could run it again.\n\n77\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.590\nSo if I close our of this query right\nhere, and I go no I shouldn't have closed\n\n78\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.640\nout of that query, I simply double click\non it, and notice how it pops back up.\n\n79\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.870\nI didn't have to re-write that entire\nquery again, it's simply there, so\n\n80\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.090\nit is really helpful as you start\nsaving these queries as well.\n\n81\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.562\nNow, we really have only one other\nelement that we need to address,\n\n82\n00:05:04.562 --> 00:05:09.277\nat least in an overview of access,\nwhich is the idea of reporting here.\n\n83\n00:05:09.277 --> 00:05:13.897\nBefore I move on from there I want to\nshow you what is actually happened so\n\n84\n00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:18.132\nfar in this little series on access,\nwe've really went ahead and\n\n85\n00:05:18.132 --> 00:05:20.410\ncreated the entire database.\n\n86\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.370\nWhich we actually have the name\nof it up here, GiftTrackingDB.\n\n87\n00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.650\nWe also created these\nthree tables over here\n\n88\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.110\nas well as a couple of different forms.\n\n89\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.250\nNow, one of these forms we did not create\nit's actually from us creating the query,\n\n90\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.040\nit actually says,\nI need to actually do a subset.\n\n91\n00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.940\nSo it was able to generate its own as\nwell and then also this IT ProTV list\n\n92\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.680\nwhich was just a form for data entry,\nand then we have this query.\n\n93\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.020\nSo every object that we create\nessentially tracking it for us.\n\n94\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.830\nAnd we'll actually see that that's\nreally going to be helpful.\n\n95\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.110\nLast element of this is\nthe idea of reporting.\n\n96\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.030\nNow reporting, it can work in the same way\nthat we also saw the idea of querying.\n\n97\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.060\nNow, even though we've used essentially\nthe wizard for creating a table, and\n\n98\n00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.390\nwe've used the wizard for creating\na forum, we've used the wizard for\n\n99\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.630\ncreating a query, it sounds like\nthe logical step here is, what?\n\n100\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.535\nWhy not use the actual wizard, so,\nto actually create look, a report wizard.\n\n101\n00:06:19.535 --> 00:06:22.251\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'll actually tell you why.\n\n102\n00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:24.121\nIt is terrible, [LAUGH] that's why.\n\n103\n00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:26.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just one of those elements.\n\n104\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.000\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n105\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.690\nSo if I go ahead and click on the report\nwizard, it looks the same, and\n\n106\n00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.170\nI'm basing the report here on\nthe query that I generated.\n\n107\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.397\nSo I want to turn this into an actual\nreport, because what I want to do,\n\n108\n00:06:39.397 --> 00:06:41.558\nI don't want to just see\nthe data on my screen.\n\n109\n00:06:41.558 --> 00:06:46.320\nI want to turn it into something I can\nprint out, so it seems easy enough.\n\n110\n00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.710\nI'll just add in every\nfield that I want and\n\n111\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.418\nthen click Next, and from here it's\nsaying, hey, how do you want to view this?\n\n112\n00:06:53.418 --> 00:06:55.540\nDo you wanna view it by each person or\nwhat prize they get?\n\n113\n00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.250\nThat sounds fun.\n\n114\n00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.900\nDo that, I can click Next and\nthen it says any grouping,\n\n115\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.960\nwe're not gonna worry about\ngrouping anything at this point.\n\n116\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.970\nAnd then do I want it in ascending,\nno I'm not gonna worry about anything.\n\n117\n00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:12.500\nClick Next here, step, block, outline and\nif this your first time doing this lot.\n\n118\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.160\nWhat the heck that does even mean?\n\n119\n00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.550\nHow the work?\n\n120\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.510\nHow do you show this?\n\n121\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.210\nIt's trying to say, hey, do you want this\nin the hierarchical way where I'm showing\n\n122\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.040\nCherokee's name and then kind of\nindented in will show what the prize is.\n\n123\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.640\nBlock of course, means line it all up, and\nthen outline where that should be that\n\n124\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.800\nkind of outline format that\nwe're normally expecting to see.\n\n125\n00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.530\nSo click Next and now it's going to\nsay what the title of the report is.\n\n126\n00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.881\nSo what you say, Gift List,\n\n127\n00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.991\nWhich I can't stop, Gift List, and\nthem I'm gonna preview this report, so\n\n128\n00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:51.704\njust like you see right here,\npreview the report, click Finish.\n\n129\n00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:56.594\nYeah, that gives you a basic report,\ndon't get me wrong, it looks okay,\n\n130\n00:07:56.594 --> 00:07:58.610\nit looks functional.\n\n131\n00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.800\nBut it really looks ugly,\nwhen it comes down to the end of this.\n\n132\n00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.220\nI really don't get any idea,\nthe modify anything and\n\n133\n00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.910\nwhen you look at it here, there's\na couple of things that look weird.\n\n134\n00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.540\nSo you saying, what do you mean by weird?\n\n135\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.710\nSo let's zoom in for\na moment and we'll see.\n\n136\n00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.779\nCherokee, I know you're\ngiving gourmet cupcakes.\n\n137\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.920\nMegan though, it looks like\nshe is really getting nothing,\n\n138\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.085\neven though I know she is.\n\n139\n00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:26.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.[CROSS_TALK] Tax should be\ninside that gift, it was online.\n\n140\n00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.218\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n141\n00:08:27.218 --> 00:08:31.126\nBut it looks like Peter gets\nthe carwash,as well as lunch@local eatery,\n\n142\n00:08:31.126 --> 00:08:33.300\nthat don't seem, good.\n\n143\n00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.480\nRonnie, don't get anything.\n\n144\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.330\nTaylor gets something.\n\n145\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.280\nTitus doesn`t look like it gets\nanything than two movies tickets\n\n146\n00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.100\nare floating out here at at in the end.\n\n147\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.945\nSo, that`s what happens\nwhen we use the wizard.\n\n148\n00:08:44.945 --> 00:08:46.630\nNow, can we fix t?\n\n149\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.120\nYou can fix it, but\nyou have to go in there and\n\n150\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.010\nactually change up every single thing\nabout the layout to do so okay.\n\n151\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.830\nSo that, all the sudden, now becomes to\nget a little bit more frightening, and\n\n152\n00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.680\nlet me show you why.\n\n153\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.250\nSo, let me go ahead and\nclose out of this print preview here.\n\n154\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.320\nThis is what it looks\nlike in the background.\n\n155\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.110\nSo when we start to take a look,\nthat's simple enough.\n\n156\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.480\nWe'll just rearrange, Goodness gracious,\nlook at all this stuff.\n\n157\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This looks terrible to actually\n\n158\n00:09:17.552 --> 00:09:20.920\nhave to be able to kind of function and\nto play around with.\n\n159\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.613\n&gt;&gt; A little intimidating.\n\n160\n00:09:21.613 --> 00:09:24.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\na little bit intimidating here, okay.\n\n161\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.960\nSo that's why\n\n162\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.560\nusing that is probably not going to be\nthe most helpful thing in the world.\n\n163\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.940\nSo can it give you a functional report?\n\n164\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.820\nYes.\n\n165\n00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.382\nDoes it look good at all?\n\n166\n00:09:37.382 --> 00:09:41.750\nNo, not in the least does it look good.\n\n167\n00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.430\nSo that's why this is probably\nnot gonna be your best bet.\n\n168\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.490\nNow, the strangest thing about the idea of\nusing reporting, right, this is not for\n\n169\n00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.620\nthe faint at heart.\n\n170\n00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.000\nOkay, so I'm not saying you can't do it.\n\n171\n00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.830\nBut as a beginner in this, it's probably\nnot gonna be something that you and\n\n172\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.710\nI are gonna do on a regular basis.\n\n173\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.970\nThe reason why is that you and\nI may not know enough about the data\n\n174\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.930\nto actually build a display what\nwe really want it to display.\n\n175\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.510\nThe key idea behind reports, especially\nin the business world, is simple.\n\n176\n00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.900\nThey need reports to show the accurate and\nthe right information that\n\n177\n00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:24.320\nthey want to see so that clear and\ngood business decisions can be made.\n\n178\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.770\nIf I'm even generating a report like that,\nright, and this is for\n\n179\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:32.590\nthe CEO of my company to hand out gifts,\nhe's going to not call Ronnie's\n\n180\n00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:37.620\nname at all at one time so\nthat's why we may not want to use that.\n\n181\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.720\n&gt;&gt; I've actually had to\ncheck reports like and\n\n182\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.410\nwe call them manifest during\nthe pogrammation for news paper layouts.\n\n183\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.190\nSo yeah, very tedious and time consuming.\n\n184\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n185\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.885\nIt's really having restructure and\n\n186\n00:10:49.885 --> 00:10:52.800\neverything inside of\njust that basic report.\n\n187\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.710\nSo, that report is what we call,\nfunctional by design.\n\n188\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.430\nIt is not meant to actually give you\nanything else but that idea of function.\n\n189\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.690\nSo report writing really inside of access\n\n190\n00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.140\nin every report writer that\ndeals with a database program.\n\n191\n00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.200\nIt's not easy.\n\n192\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.330\nThat's what I wanted to tell you.\n\n193\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.740\nBut, so what can I do?\n\n194\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.840\nWell, if I wanna generate just a fast and\neasy report, the great thing is right up\n\n195\n00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.420\nhere, inside of the report grouping,\nis if I hover over this,\n\n196\n00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.370\nit says Create a basic report based on\nthe data of a current query or table.\n\n197\n00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.140\nSo I could go into the tables and actually\ngenerate whatever report I want to.\n\n198\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.650\nBut it's always better if you\nknow what data you wanna see, and\n\n199\n00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.380\nthat means you go ahead and\ncreate the query.\n\n200\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.560\nCuz that's usually the field\nyou wanna see together.\n\n201\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.980\nAnd then I just hit report, and\nnow by comparison look at this one.\n\n202\n00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.870\nNow, it is still functional, but\nit actually makes more sense.\n\n203\n00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.926\nSo you might go,\nI am going to do the report wizard, and\n\n204\n00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:55.125\nthen when that doesn't show up\nyou are going to go [SOUND].\n\n205\n00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:59.578\nIf you just need something functional and\nthat is going to work using that\n\n206\n00:11:59.578 --> 00:12:04.230\nidea of that report, or just that\nbasic report is going to help you.\n\n207\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.937\nNow, once we have that, let me see if I\ncan change this up just for a moment here.\n\n208\n00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:11.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthose shaded lines really do help.\n\n209\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do help here.\n\n210\n00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.907\nSo now I can take this, and then I'm\ngonna click inside of this contextual\n\n211\n00:12:17.907 --> 00:12:21.743\nribbon here that says,\nreport layout towards on format.\n\n212\n00:12:21.743 --> 00:12:24.700\nAnd that's like background image,\nand click browse.\n\n213\n00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.784\nAnd then, I'm going to select\nthe image that I picked.\n\n214\n00:12:29.784 --> 00:12:35.120\nAnd now, I can also go ahead and\nadd that image in there.\n\n215\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.768\nAnd then,\nwe can start changing up a few things.\n\n216\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.276\nSo now I can say, all right,\nwe'll take out that tbl.\n\n217\n00:12:44.276 --> 00:12:48.855\nAnd then because of this red background,\ninstead,\n\n218\n00:12:48.855 --> 00:12:52.088\nI can make it nice and white and even.\n\n219\n00:12:52.088 --> 00:12:54.530\nLet me see if I can\nselect everything there.\n\n220\n00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:01.950\nMake it bold, like this and then from\nthat point, I've got the background.\n\n221\n00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.970\nNow, this is where I have to go back\ninto design view a little bit and\n\n222\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:13.050\nthen stretch this out because\nwe can't see the whole image.\n\n223\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.860\nBut we can at least see a part of it.\n\n224\n00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.000\nSo this is not something\nwe would normally do.\n\n225\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.770\nBut now you can take a look.\n\n226\n00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:20.978\n&gt;&gt; Pretty fancy.\n\n227\n00:13:20.978 --> 00:13:22.731\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then be able to,\n\n228\n00:13:22.731 --> 00:13:24.221\njust to a little bit here.\n\n229\n00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:25.280\n&gt;&gt; A little formatting.\n\n230\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.970\n&gt;&gt; To add in, just enough for\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n231\n00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.620\nSo you can just see some of\nthe information that we're talking about.\n\n232\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.140\nI'm just trying to get out of it now.\n\n233\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:39.530\nBut just that way to,\nto kind of change up a little bit,\n\n234\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.900\nbut that report wizard really\njust doesn't help you.\n\n235\n00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.660\nSo if you're not gonna really be\nhelped by it even though they're going\n\n236\n00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.880\nthis has gotta be the most\nhelpful thing in the world.\n\n237\n00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.760\nI wouldn't use it if it were me.\n\n238\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.160\nAnd I've worked in Access a lot, and\neverybody always wants to do that and\n\n239\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.400\nI'm like, but\nit always generates terrible, and\n\n240\n00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.770\nI say, just do the simple one and then\nyou can go back in there design it and\n\n241\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.560\nmove things around\nthe way that you want to.\n\n242\n00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.555\nIt's a lot easier, it's a lot cleaner,\n\n243\n00:14:03.555 --> 00:14:07.147\nit will help you out instead of having\nto work through everything else too.\n\n244\n00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:11.248\nNow, the other thing that we can do here,\nand we're not gonna do it at this point\n\n245\n00:14:11.248 --> 00:14:15.168\nbecause that becomes more advanced to\nreport writing, is I can actually put\n\n246\n00:14:15.168 --> 00:14:19.298\nthe first name and the last name have have\na reported as single field if I want to.\n\n247\n00:14:19.298 --> 00:14:20.770\nSo if you go,\nI don't like the way that these.\n\n248\n00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.950\nI would rather have it ind of\nscrunched up as one field reporting\n\n249\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.730\nas two gigantic boxes or\nthere that we have here.\n\n250\n00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:32.510\nWe can do that as well, but at this\nparticular point, it's just the goal\n\n251\n00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.740\nof understanding that the reason behind\nthe reports is really the important thing.\n\n252\n00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:43.200\nMost of your people that need that\ndata base, they don't want the entire\n\n253\n00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.770\ndata base, they want to know what\ninformation that they can get out of it.\n\n254\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.630\nThe way you display that to them\nis by simply running the reports.\n\n255\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.480\nThe neat thing in the end then\n\n256\n00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.380\nis that more than likely whatever\ndatabase that you're given\n\n257\n00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.920\nyou'll see that under Reports they already\nhave the ones generated that they need.\n\n258\n00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.670\nSo after you finish your data entry,\nafter you finish doing what you need to,\n\n259\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.640\nmore than likely they'll just\nask you to run that report.\n\n260\n00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.800\nAnd the way that you do that\nLet me save the changes\n\n261\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.380\nas now I'm gonna close out of this here.\n\n262\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.200\nAnd we'll type in RPT, maybe?\n\n263\n00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.790\nFor a report prefix,\nyou don't have to do it that way but\n\n264\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.770\nit just went ahead and let me do this.\n\n265\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.050\nAnd then, you just come here and\nyou run it and there it is.\n\n266\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.850\nIt gives you just a little bit of,\nnow we didn't go super fancy and\n\n267\n00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.430\ndesign everything out, but we at least\nshowed you, you can add in extra elements.\n\n268\n00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.699\nYou can move things around if you want to,\nbut\n\n269\n00:15:38.699 --> 00:15:41.580\nthis show is not about learning\nhow to do report writing.\n\n270\n00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.546\nSo we just wanna at least show you\nthat there is functionality here, so\n\n271\n00:15:44.546 --> 00:15:47.790\nthat you can get the data out of\nyour database that you need to.\n\n272\n00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.390\nAnd if we take a look at all that,\nalong with all the other things we've been\n\n273\n00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.900\ntaking look at and access, It at least\ngives you a start and an understanding\n\n274\n00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.410\nwhen somebody says, yeah, you're gonna\nbe creating reports out of Access.\n\n275\n00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.720\nYou're gonna be creating\nqueries out of Access.\n\n276\n00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.230\nYou're gonna be doing data entry Into an\nAccess database, that's what we're talking\n\n277\n00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.640\nabout and that's what you've actually\nbeen seeing here in this series.\n\n278\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt Ronnie.\n\n279\n00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.253\nThe advent of a Relational\nDatabase Management Systems and\n\n280\n00:16:15.253 --> 00:16:19.561\nthe efficiency that they provide\nto our businesses is
