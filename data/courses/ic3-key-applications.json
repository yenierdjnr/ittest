00:00:16.649\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.540\nin today's episode we're coming\nback with more IC3 information.\n\n5\n00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.640\nAnd that's right, today we're gonna be\nlooking at working with applications.\n\n6\n00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.570\nAnd joining me in the studio today\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.930\nRonnie, how are you doing, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great as we\ncontinue on to take a look at\n\n9\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.810\nthe idea of working with key applications.\n\n10\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.590\nSomebody that is just beginning\nthe environment in terms of working with\n\n11\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.480\nthe computer,\n\n12\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.740\nwe need to understand of course\nthe idea of working with applications.\n\n13\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.770\nThe majority of times as you begin\nyour career in working with computers,\n\n14\n00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.900\nyou do not tend to work with\nthe operating system directly.\n\n15\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.120\nDon't get me wrong you'll use\nan operating system every day, but\n\n16\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.610\nyou don't tend to manipulate the operating\nsystem or change it on a daily basis.\n\n17\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.440\nIt really runs in the background and\n\n18\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.790\nallows us to do the interaction\nthat we want to.\n\n19\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.640\nBut on a daily basis, and\neven on an hourly basis at times,\n\n20\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.440\nyou will be working directly with\nindividual applications depending on\n\n21\n00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.400\nwhat you're actually doing, and that means\nyou need to spend a little bit of time and\n\n22\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.760\nunderstanding of course, the idea of\napplications and working with them.\n\n23\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.520\nNow, when we start talking about\nthe idea of working with applications.\n\n24\n00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.033\nWe're gonna show a few things, but\nreally, today is more of a discovery of\n\n25\n00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:32.329\ntalking about how in the world\ndo we get applications so\n\n26\n00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.940\nthat we can begin to work with them.\n\n27\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.247\nAnd, then we want to talk about some\nof the key applications, as well, and\n\n28\n00:01:38.247 --> 00:01:41.254\nthen talk about the installation,\nas well as the uninstallation.\n\n29\n00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:44.837\nAnd even a few different things that\nwe have to worry about when we do get\n\n30\n00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:49.370\napplications such as licensing agreements\nthat we have to worry about as well.\n\n31\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.874\nSo we're gonna be spending a bit of\ntime in going through several different\n\n32\n00:01:53.874 --> 00:01:57.663\ncategories and the idea of getting\nthe applications as well and\n\n33\n00:01:57.663 --> 00:02:00.537\nthat's what we want to\nstart off to take a look.\n\n34\n00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.164\nNow, at one point in time.\n\n35\n00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:07.490\nWhen we talk about the notion\nhere of getting applications.\n\n36\n00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.460\nThere used to only be one way.\n\n37\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.720\nAnd that was, you would go to your local\nretail store that sold software programs.\n\n38\n00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.110\nAnd you would pretty much pick\nthe software program that you needed.\n\n39\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.309\nIt would come in a cardboard box and the\nbox would look as impressive as could be.\n\n40\n00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.533\nIt would tell you all the details and\n\n41\n00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.091\non that box a lot of that of\ncourse was a nice fancy cover but\n\n42\n00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:33.987\nwhat you also need to look for of course\nwas specifications such as the idea here\n\n43\n00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:39.310\nof the minimum requirements needed to\nrun that application on your computer.\n\n44\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.640\nSo you do want to pay attention to things\nlike that when you go and take a look.\n\n45\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.610\nNow when you start to talk about that then\nthere's a couple of different things that\n\n46\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.100\nwe also need to know in today's world\nas well that will really help us out.\n\n47\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.410\nYou don't have to go to a particular\n\n48\n00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.410\nretail store anymore to\npurchase applications.\n\n49\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.190\nTo tell you the truth, you really\ndon't have to actually do much at all,\n\n50\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.430\nexcept for being able to get access to\nthe Internet anymore to get applications.\n\n51\n00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.780\nAnd today's application market is so\ndiverse because applications are not only\n\n52\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.290\ndealt with on the desktop computer and\nlaptop computers but\n\n53\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.010\nalso on mobile devices too where\nwe tend to work with them as well.\n\n54\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.070\nSo we need to understanding\nat least in those context,\n\n55\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.415\nhow do we normally get\napplications if we are to do so?\n\n56\n00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:31.555\nSo we're gonna take a look at all\nthese features, and show you,\n\n57\n00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:34.455\nof course then,\nhow to obtain different applications.\n\n58\n00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:36.615\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\nI've grabbed my mobile phone.\n\n59\n00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.905\nI've decided that I need\nsome kind of application.\n\n60\n00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:41.015\nI'm not sure exactly what application.\n\n61\n00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:43.945\nWhere am I gonna start looking when it\ncomes to acquiring those applications like\n\n62\n00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:44.905\nyou had mentioned?\n\n63\n00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:48.205\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to\nthe idea of working with a smartphone,\n\n64\n00:03:48.205 --> 00:03:52.190\nyou've really got to actually determine,\nwell, two things here, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.980\nFirst and foremost you need to determine\nwhat smartphone system are you using.\n\n66\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.350\nAnd by smartphone system,\n\n67\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.860\nnormally today it kinda breaks down into\none of three different smartphones, right?\n\n68\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.550\nWe tend to either have some type of\niPhone, okay, from Apple Computers.\n\n69\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.410\nOr tend to run some type of\nAndroid-based device, and\n\n70\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.800\nthose have many different\nhardware vendors out there.\n\n71\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.860\nBut they all support what we call Android.\n\n72\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.690\nAnd then, of course,\nthere is the Windows mobile phone as well.\n\n73\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.582\nThose are three different types of\noperating systems that also will allow you\n\n74\n00:04:24.582 --> 00:04:26.990\nto install applications on them, but\n\n75\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.410\nit also means that you have to know\nhow to get access to them to do so.\n\n76\n00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.810\nNow I've got an example of really\nthe idea of the Android, but\n\n77\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.690\nwe can talk about the other\nones here to help us out, too.\n\n78\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.870\nWhen it comes down to things like\nsmartphones, they do not run the standard\n\n79\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.580\napplications that you normally find\nrunning on regular desktop computers.\n\n80\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.600\nThese are designed to be more streamlined,\n\n81\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.736\nthey're designed to be\nmuch more efficient.\n\n82\n00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:55.811\nThey are not designed to be very\npowerful types of systems that or\n\n83\n00:04:55.811 --> 00:05:00.564\ntypes of applications that allow you to\nget a [INAUDIBLE] because most of them\n\n84\n00:05:00.564 --> 00:05:05.317\nare actually working on a screen that's\nlet's say five and a half inches,\n\n85\n00:05:05.317 --> 00:05:09.660\nsix inches maybe overall as a rectangle\nto be able to work on that.\n\n86\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.040\nDon't get me wrong, can you accomplish\na lot, definitely you can but\n\n87\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.480\noverall they're not actually designed\nto actually be one of these powerful\n\n88\n00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.820\napplications that eat up\na bunch of system resources.\n\n89\n00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.010\nThey're really designed to be\nvery efficient applications.\n\n90\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.640\nSo let's take for an example then,\nthat you have an Android device well,\n\n91\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.030\nwhat do you end up doing?\n\n92\n00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.810\nWell, let me show you on my screen.\n\n93\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.550\nI've got a piece of software here\nthat's going to allow me to connect.\n\n94\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.760\nAnd I've got my particular\nsmartphone connected to this, so\n\n95\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.450\nthat we can see it just\na little bit better.\n\n96\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.880\nSo on this particular Samsung machine.\n\n97\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.060\nYou can see right here.\n\n98\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.090\nThis is pretty much what my phone.\n\n99\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.840\nAnd actually, this is the dirt road\nthat I live on as the background.\n\n100\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.090\nBut here, when you start to take a look,\n\n101\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.700\nthere's a couple of things that\nwe want to take a look at.\n\n102\n00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.540\nBut when it comes down to\nobtaining the idea of applications\n\n103\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.950\nthere's really one central repository for\nus to be able to take a look at and\n\n104\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.970\nthat is what they call\nthe Google Play Store, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.224\nNow, usually on your Android\ndevice there'll be standard\n\n106\n00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:13.475\nicons that are actually loaded\non there when you go ahead and\n\n107\n00:06:13.475 --> 00:06:17.654\nyou enter in your user account that\nyou'll have to create at the beginning.\n\n108\n00:06:17.654 --> 00:06:21.311\nAnd, from that point, it will connect\nyou to these different places, and\n\n109\n00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:21.960\nthere it is.\n\n110\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.635\nI am now connected into\nthe Google Play Store.\n\n111\n00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:26.110\nAlmost said Gloogle.\n\n112\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.970\nGoogle Play Store.\n\n113\n00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.190\nAnd, it's here that you can see some\nof the different applications that\n\n114\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.720\nare actually available for\nyou to be able to download.\n\n115\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.480\nSome of these will actually\nhave cost associated with them.\n\n116\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.290\nSome of them are actually for free.\n\n117\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.320\nSo most of the ones that I see\nright here are actually for free.\n\n118\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.630\nBut I'm pretty sure if I scroll enough,\n\n119\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.710\nI can end up finding some that\nactually have of different cost.\n\n120\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.320\nOkay.\nSo\n\n121\n00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.150\nyou gotta actually take a look around and\nsee what you really need.\n\n122\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I've been to one\nof these screens before and\n\n123\n00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.310\none of the things it warned me,\nit said it may contain additional\n\n124\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.390\npurchases in order to get the full user\nexperience, what does that mean for us?\n\n125\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, the way that this actually\nends up working a lot of times,\n\n126\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.490\nwhen we start talking about getting some\ntype of application from the Play Store or\n\n127\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.820\nfrom any store is that they have\nwhat to call In-App purchases.\n\n128\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.175\nNow, that term In-App purchase\nmay mean that they'll give\n\n129\n00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:21.058\nyou some functionality of that\nparticular application for free, but\n\n130\n00:07:21.058 --> 00:07:23.453\nif you want to access more functionality.\n\n131\n00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:26.368\nThey tell you that you have to\nupgrade to the pro edition,\n\n132\n00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:29.227\nwhich means you've already\ngotten the application but\n\n133\n00:07:29.227 --> 00:07:33.720\nnow you need to pay a little bit more and\nget access to the pro edition instead.\n\n134\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.420\nThen all those other\nfeatures will be opened up.\n\n135\n00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:42.100\nNow most of these applications that we're\ntalking about they can actually run very\n\n136\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:49.280\ncheaply from maybe 99 cents, but some of\nthem can be incredibly expensive as well.\n\n137\n00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.494\nDon't overlook that as far\nas a purchase goes, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:55.021\nNow when you start talking\nabout purchasing them,\n\n139\n00:07:55.021 --> 00:07:56.970\nof course there's a couple of things.\n\n140\n00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.355\nLet me show you here the couple of things\nthat you have to worry about You might be\n\n141\n00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:03.350\nsaying, well, if they're all free,\ndo I need to do anything else?\n\n142\n00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.127\nWell, once you set up your account on your\nsmartphone, really one of the only other\n\n143\n00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:11.966\nthings that you might have to do is,\nlet me see if I can select that.\n\n144\n00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:16.227\nAnd that little hamburger button that you\nsaw in the upper right-hand corner, what\n\n145\n00:08:16.227 --> 00:08:20.260\nyou want to do is you want to scroll down\nhere to where you have some options here.\n\n146\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.840\nAnd let's see if I can zoom in.\n\n147\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.570\nOkay.\n\n148\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.190\nOne is your account and notice that\nyou have redeem and send a gift and\n\n149\n00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.540\ndifferent things here.\n\n150\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.225\nSo on this idea of the account\nif I can select that, well here,\n\n151\n00:08:32.225 --> 00:08:37.280\nlet me scroll out, and notice you might\nhave to add in a payment method, and\n\n152\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.460\nusually this involves a credit\ncard of some sort of.\n\n153\n00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.270\nNow I'm not going to click on mine so\nyou can see all the information.\n\n154\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.800\nBut, you get the idea here that\nyou do have to get that set up for\n\n155\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.350\nyou when you are actually\nconnecting to do this.\n\n156\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.120\nNow, the other system that's also out\nthere and let me see if I can scroll in.\n\n157\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.840\nThat way we get an example of both\nhere is inside of the Microsoft\n\n158\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.850\nworld that we call the Apple app store,\nthe app store itself, okay.\n\n159\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.490\nThe app store will pretty\nmuch show up like this.\n\n160\n00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.980\nAnd what you'll also end up seeing\nis that you will have, of course,\n\n161\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.780\nthe different apps.\n\n162\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.180\nSo like right here, you can see some of\nthese are actually gonna be expensive.\n\n163\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.978\nSo here's one for $13,\nand it's a pinball game.\n\n164\n00:09:16.978 --> 00:09:18.780\nThat doesn't sound super expensive, but\n\n165\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.190\nyou start adding them up after\nyou click on these things.\n\n166\n00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:26.140\nHere's excuse me,\nhere is one that says 24.99.\n\n167\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.971\nSo, you can see where it's actually\nstarting to get a little bit more.\n\n168\n00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:32.850\nHere's one that's $30, 34.99.\n\n169\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.300\nHere's one another one in here 45 bucks.\n\n170\n00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.880\nSo you can see where now all of a sudden\nthese things can get expensive.\n\n171\n00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.270\nYou still do the same thing.\n\n172\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.110\nYou go to the App Store,\nwhether you're on your iPhone.\n\n173\n00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.180\nHere I'm actually on just a Macbook Pro.\n\n174\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.290\nAnd you can of course download\nthese applications and pay for\n\n175\n00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.310\nthem and the same thing you stop to set up\nan account and still gonna charge you for.\n\n176\n00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.170\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, you know, you talked about\nthe old method that we used actually get\n\n177\n00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.780\ninto a car and\ndrive to a store by a box and\n\n178\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.260\nwe will install our one piece of software\non let's say, a desktop for instance.\n\n179\n00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.050\nNow Ronnie,\nyou're saying there's a benefit.\n\n180\n00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.360\nI can actually go multi platform in some\ncircumstances with these applications.\n\n181\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.030\nSo you can buy it once and\n\n182\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.680\nhave the potential to maybe use\nit on more than one device?\n\n183\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.780\n&gt;&gt; It depends on that licensing agreement,\nwhether or not it allows it to do that.\n\n184\n00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.910\nSo here for Apple, yes you definitely can.\n\n185\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:29.290\nIf you buy it for your iPhone,\nyou can also, of course, have it download,\n\n186\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.860\neven to your MacBook Pro as long as it\nworks and does what it needs to do.\n\n187\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.550\nIt will actually have that function for\nyou.\n\n188\n00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.180\nSo some of them will allow you to do that.\n\n189\n00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.910\nSome of them may say look, maybe not.\n\n190\n00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.790\nAnd then, of course,\nthere's also the Windows,\n\n191\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.360\nthey just call it the Windows Store right,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n192\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.640\nThe Windows Store presents\nsomething fairly similar but\n\n193\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.730\ninstead you'll see different tiles\ninstead of actually individual icons like\n\n194\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.890\nwhat we're seeing here.\n\n195\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.480\nAnd they will either have\na cost associated with them or\n\n196\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.155\nthey would be free for\nyou to be able to download.\n\n197\n00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:04.270\nAnd then once they're download they\nwill show up in your start menu and\n\n198\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:08.950\nyou should also be able to use that to do\neverything that you want to, but obtaining\n\n199\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:14.070\nthe apps, not difficult but you do need\nto know where you can obtain them from.\n\n200\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.530\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I'm not sure if anybody's out\nthere's familiar with my typing abilities,\n\n201\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.480\nbut you are talking about in the context\nof obtaining an application.\n\n202\n00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.500\nWhat happens if I accidentally\nmaybe type the wrong button, and\n\n203\n00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.880\nI delete this application?\n\n204\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.420\nLet's say, for instance,\nin your example here.\n\n205\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.809\nThe [INAUDIBLE], well,\nI almost said iTunes.\n\n206\n00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:32.361\nBut the app store here.\nDo I have the ability to reobtain that?\n\n207\n00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:35.690\nOr have I pretty much just lost it?\n\n208\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.640\n&gt;&gt; Usually,\nonce you've actually purchased that.\n\n209\n00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.930\nYou should be able to go back and\nget it on that device again and\n\n210\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.680\nit should be perfectly fine.\n\n211\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.620\nRemember that what you're doing is you're\nreally only downloading a copy of it, but\n\n212\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.310\nyou did purchase it for it's use, so\nthat way they always have a copy and\n\n213\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.780\nyou don't have to store a copy of\nit on your smaller devices here.\n\n214\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.080\nIt's always available to you as long as\nyou have Internet access, and that's kind\n\n215\n00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.850\nof the key when you start talking\nabout obtaining those applications.\n\n216\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.790\nNow, are those the only places\nthat you can get them from?\n\n217\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.120\nDefinitely not.\n\n218\n00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.440\nSo, there's also a lot of times where\nyou might find out something that,\n\n219\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.020\nit doesn't exist in one\nof those two places.\n\n220\n00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.110\nWell, that's when you have to\nmake a judgment of whether or\n\n221\n00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.560\nnot you should do this, or\nwhether you shouldn't do this, and\n\n222\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.720\nthat does come down to a judgement call.\n\n223\n00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.287\nMost of the time as far as beginners go,\nI recommend that you don't install\n\n224\n00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:28.724\nanything that doesn't come from at\nleast the official stores instead.\n\n225\n00:12:28.724 --> 00:12:32.945\nAs you get more advanced and you become\na little bit more trusting in these places\n\n226\n00:12:32.945 --> 00:12:36.726\nthat you can download apps from you\ndefinitely can, and then that way,\n\n227\n00:12:36.726 --> 00:12:39.814\nit will give you instructions\non how to actually do that and\n\n228\n00:12:39.814 --> 00:12:42.481\nget it installed onto your\ndevice sometimes too.\n\n229\n00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:45.087\nAnd so you do need to pay attention,\nbut overall though,\n\n230\n00:12:45.087 --> 00:12:46.783\nwe're not going that much in depth.\n\n231\n00:12:46.783 --> 00:12:50.410\nBut just realize that there are other ways\nthat you can get applications on there.\n\n232\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.540\nBut the best way of course is\nto go through those stores.\n\n233\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.080\nUsually once you click on it and you\naccept whatever the price is going to be,\n\n234\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.800\nyou normally end up downloading.\n\n235\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.390\nFor example, in the app store\nitself from Apple, it goes and\n\n236\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.950\ntells you it's downloading and\nthen it tells you it's installing.\n\n237\n00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.110\nThen when it's done, it tells you,\nhey, you've completed the download and\n\n238\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.550\nit's installed and all you have to do is\ngo and run it, and then you're off and\n\n239\n00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.680\nready to go.\n\n240\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.270\nInside of that Google Play Store,\n\n241\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.300\nit normally just tells you it's finished\ndownloading, and it's installing.\n\n242\n00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.294\nAnd, then it's ready for you to use.\n\n243\n00:13:19.294 --> 00:13:21.750\nSometimes, it's running in\nthe background already.\n\n244\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.550\nIt just depends on what you\nreally want to do with it.\n\n245\n00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.600\nBut that purchase of that is\nactually going to be key, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.510\nSo just remember that either\nit's going to be free or\n\n247\n00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.380\nyou're going to have to pay some money for\nit.\n\n248\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.960\nBut the way that you do that\nis by setting up and account.\n\n249\n00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.540\nSo just realize you'll probably\neither make a Google account or\n\n250\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.330\nyou'll probably end up\nmaking an Apple ID account.\n\n251\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.380\nAnd the key here is remembering\nthose account passwords.\n\n252\n00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.950\nDon't lose them,\nas easy as it sounds, they tell you,\n\n253\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.430\njust click here where it says forgot\nyour password and you're ready to go,\n\n254\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:57.850\nyou'll find out something as fast as you\ncan type that in and send you something,\n\n255\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.320\nyou're almost expecting this world for\nit, to be instantaneous.\n\n256\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.390\nYou got to enter all that stuff back in.\n\n257\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.690\nAnd then it tells you,\nokay looks like everything is done.\n\n258\n00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.830\nYou try and log back in and it may work\nautomatically and immediately sometimes.\n\n259\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.610\nSometimes if you're like me,\nit takes a good 30 minutes and\n\n260\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.630\nfinally after a little bit\nof time it's like, okay.\n\n261\n00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.140\nIt takes some time to\nget through the system.\n\n262\n00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.500\nBut what am I expecting?\n\n263\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.500\nIt to work immediately.\n\n264\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.400\nSo Just kind of realize you\nhave to deal with that.\n\n265\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.630\nObtaining the application is\nreally part of the battle, but\n\n266\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.210\nthe good thing is on smartphones,\nusually the installation and\n\n267\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.820\nit working is probably all done and\nyou don't have to worry.\n\n268\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.850\nNow, on the desktop environment though,\nIt can change up a little bit.\n\n269\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.670\nLet's go to a Windows 7 machine that\nwill really help us to understand this\n\n270\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.120\na little more.\n\n271\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.180\nNow from Windows 7 I went ahead and\nI've downloaded a couple of pieces of\n\n272\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.580\nfreeware that we can actually use to\nshow us a couple of different things.\n\n273\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.330\nSo over here on the left\nhand side on my screen,\n\n274\n00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.490\nI downloaded two different applications,\nokay?\n\n275\n00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.975\nNow, if I had actually purchase these, It\nwould come on some type of media, whether\n\n276\n00:15:04.975 --> 00:15:09.585\nit's on a USB flash drive or whether\nit's actually on something like a CD or\n\n277\n00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:14.845\na DVD disk and I would have to be able\nof course to run that and install it.\n\n278\n00:15:14.845 --> 00:15:19.645\nBut here I simply downloaded it off\nthe Internet and then I can go ahead and\n\n279\n00:15:19.645 --> 00:15:21.275\ndouble click on this and\n\n280\n00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:25.682\nhere's the first thing that we do need\nto pay attention to which is right here.\n\n281\n00:15:25.682 --> 00:15:28.480\nAll right, so\non my screen I went ahead and\n\n282\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.570\nI've downloaded a couple of\ndifferent apps from the Internet.\n\n283\n00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.710\nAnd I'm just gonna use, well,\n\n284\n00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.450\none of these to show the installation\nprocess on a desktop computer instead.\n\n285\n00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:42.103\nSo on this one down here,\nthis one is actually called TFTPD32.\n\n286\n00:15:42.103 --> 00:15:43.310\nYou're probably like,\nwhat the heck is that?\n\n287\n00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.970\nDon't worry about it.\n\n288\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.910\nIt's just an application\nthat we are going to run.\n\n289\n00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.783\nAnd in the Windows 7 environment,\n\n290\n00:15:48.783 --> 00:15:51.911\nhere's the first thing it's\ngoing to end up doing, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:55.449\nSo, you can tell that this particular\napplication was designed with\n\n292\n00:15:55.449 --> 00:15:57.460\nthis security feature in mind.\n\n293\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.623\nWhich gives us this user account control.\n\n294\n00:15:59.623 --> 00:16:03.620\nAnd when we take a look it's saying, look,\nare you sure you really want to do this?\n\n295\n00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.350\nDo you know that this is going\nto end up making some type\n\n296\n00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.090\nof change to the computer system?\n\n297\n00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.120\nAre you sure?\n\n298\n00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.410\nAnd you simply go ahead and select Yes.\n\n299\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.320\nAnd now this is what we want to\ntake a look at as well, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.360\nNotice that this one says\nEuropean Union Public Licence.\n\n301\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.120\nBut this is also something\nelse that you may also see.\n\n302\n00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.020\nHere in the United States we tend to\ncall this the idea of the end user\n\n303\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.850\nlicensing agreement.\n\n304\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:28.510\nOkay?\n\n305\n00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.870\nIn short EULA, the end user licensing\nagreement is another part of it.\n\n306\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.010\nNow what is that about?\n\n307\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.670\nThat is about the legal right\nthat that particular company or\n\n308\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.390\nperson that has produced this.\n\n309\n00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.350\nThey're saying what you can use this for,\nand what you shouldn't use this for.\n\n310\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.340\nNow it doesn't mean that if you\nstart using it for some of your own\n\n311\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.830\nnefarious purposes, that they're\ngoing to come out and just bite you.\n\n312\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.520\nNo, it doesn't mean that they're sending\nthe police after you immediately.\n\n313\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.310\nBut, it does mean that they can.\n\n314\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.325\nAnd, that's the key on some of these.\n\n315\n00:17:01.325 --> 00:17:05.133\nNow, when we get into this a little\nbit further and we've actually gotta,\n\n316\n00:17:05.133 --> 00:17:08.165\nthere's another exam that's\ncoming along with the IC3.\n\n317\n00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:12.907\nWe can talk about this idea of\nthe proprietary and the open source,\n\n318\n00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:17.151\nI was trying to remember what\nthose terms were, software.\n\n319\n00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:20.043\nAnd it actually says a little\nbit more about those details.\n\n320\n00:17:20.043 --> 00:17:23.647\nAnd normally this one right here,\nif you actually go through,\n\n321\n00:17:23.647 --> 00:17:26.095\nand you can see that\nwith the European one.\n\n322\n00:17:26.095 --> 00:17:32.770\nInstead of actually calling that an EULA\nhere they call it an EUPL instead.\n\n323\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.340\nBut it's the same functional\nidea that we're talking about.\n\n324\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.840\nAnd this is just letting you know\nthe legal requirements here, okay?\n\n325\n00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.772\nThat you have to understand\nas you go through this.\n\n326\n00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:49.093\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, is it fair to say with the U,\nPLL, let me see if I can say that again.\n\n327\n00:17:49.093 --> 00:17:50.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; EUPL.\n\n328\n00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:52.550\nI'm so used to calling it the EULA.\n\n329\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.790\nThat this is a legally binding contract\nand you can be either charged or\n\n330\n00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.450\nheld accountable with\nsome kind of litigation.\n\n331\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.532\n&gt;&gt; It is very possible.\n\n332\n00:18:00.532 --> 00:18:03.170\nAnd that's the key is to understand\nthat everything that's written here\n\n333\n00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.030\nas you were to scroll through that,\nit's all written by, well, lawyers.\n\n334\n00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.670\nAnd so, you have to understand\nthat what they're telling you is,\n\n335\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.120\nI do have the ability to\ndo this if I need to.\n\n336\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.420\nBut here's what you can do with it, and\nhere's what you shouldn't do with it.\n\n337\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.300\nAnd so, they are just telling you that if\nthey want to one day, they can come and\n\n338\n00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.520\nget you, as far as bringing charges\nagainst you, if they choose to.\n\n339\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.960\nSo you're either going to agree or\ncancel, if you select Cancel,\n\n340\n00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.860\nif we take a look at my screen again.\n\n341\n00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.200\nIf you select Cancel, it means,\nwell, it's not going to install.\n\n342\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.290\nYou select I Agree,\nthat means you agree to it.\n\n343\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:39.460\nAnd then from that point on you can go\nahead and take a look at the installation\n\n344\n00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.955\noptions and then select what you\nwant to actually select here.\n\n345\n00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:43.770\nOkay?\n\n346\n00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:48.110\nSo at this point I might go ahead and\nclick Next and then I select Install.\n\n347\n00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.280\nYou can select a different path for\nthe file to get installed,\n\n348\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.870\nbut I'm just going to leave it at\nits default and let it install.\n\n349\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.245\nAnd you might say,\nwhy did you choose that file?\n\n350\n00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:57.930\nCuz it installs almost\nimmediately here and\n\n351\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.920\nyou're not just watching a green\nbar go across the screen.\n\n352\n00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.880\nAnd once that's done, I can click Close.\n\n353\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.170\nAnd then, when I scroll back out.\n\n354\n00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.880\nAnd let me show you one of the things\nthat I did that changed the system that\n\n355\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.500\nWindows 7 really doesn't like.\n\n356\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.950\nIt created this little desktop icon for\nus, a shortcut is also what it created.\n\n357\n00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.180\nAnd also, modified something\nin that program file path.\n\n358\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.880\nAnd said, look, you're actually\ninstalling something that's changing.\n\n359\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.370\nAre you sure you want that as well?\n\n360\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.080\nSo that particular installation and\n\n361\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.410\nthe way that you can verify that it\nworks is you simply double-click on it.\n\n362\n00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.570\nAnd then it's telling me there's a couple\nof other things that it wants to do.\n\n363\n00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:36.900\nThis one wants to open up the firewall.\n\n364\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.940\nSo you might go,\nyes I want it to or no you don't.\n\n365\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.500\nWell, you gotta make\nthose decisions as well.\n\n366\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.270\nNow on a desktop computer that you're\nusing at work, it's not your choice, okay?\n\n367\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.290\nDo not install something on there\nthat is not going to be approved.\n\n368\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.690\nBut if you ever have\na question about this,\n\n369\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.720\nyou do need to ask your\nIT support personnel.\n\n370\n00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.060\nTo say hey, I've just installed\nthis program, is that okay or not?\n\n371\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.083\nAnd let them tell you.\n\n372\n00:20:03.083 --> 00:20:07.602\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you mentioned just a few\nminutes ago in this about knowing who\n\n373\n00:20:07.602 --> 00:20:09.520\nyou're downloading from.\n\n374\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.077\nIs this right here what we see?\n\n375\n00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:14.783\nA prime example, is it, to know and trust\nwho it is that you are communicating.\n\n376\n00:20:14.783 --> 00:20:17.540\nBecause it could open some kind\nof security vulnerability?\n\n377\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a part of it, right?\n\n378\n00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.020\nThe very fact is that, yes, you should\nonly download from trusted sources and\n\n379\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.220\nthat should be absolutely clear.\n\n380\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.700\nBut here is something that\nI'm just letting you know.\n\n381\n00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.420\nThis picker program is now saying,\nlook, I need to request access\n\n382\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.620\nthrough your firewall, and\nthat's when you have to be careful.\n\n383\n00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.970\nIf you know that it's gonna do that,\n\n384\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.900\nperfectly fine as long\nas you understand that.\n\n385\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.250\nBut it's not fine if you don't\nunderstand what that actually means.\n\n386\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:41.900\nDon't do it.\n\n387\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.720\nThat's what it really means\nwhen it comes down to it, okay?\n\n388\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.010\nSo just realize that there's a couple of\ndifferent things when you start talking\n\n389\n00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:53.850\nabout the installation of what has to go\non when you start to see that as well.\n\n390\n00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.920\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you started to\nscroll a little bit through to\n\n391\n00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.190\none of the application stores,\nif you will.\n\n392\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.240\nAnd I know there's a few of them, and\n\n393\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.160\nthe first thing I did is I got\nlost in the sea of the mix.\n\n394\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.700\nWhat application is what,\nwhat application does what?\n\n395\n00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.280\nCan you help us out on there, helping\nus kinda know some rhyme from reason.\n\n396\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.105\nAnd what all these different\napplications might fall into?\n\n397\n00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:15.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a bunch of different\ncategories of applications that you need\n\n398\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.130\nto be able to understand as you\nstart working with computers.\n\n399\n00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.370\nNow when it comes down to it,\nit breaks down into several kinda\n\n400\n00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.790\nbig categories here, and we're gonna go\nthrough some different examples of them.\n\n401\n00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:30.040\nBut the biggest category by far, since\nyou're starting your work in the realm of\n\n402\n00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:35.230\ncomputing is gonna be the idea of what we\ncall business productivity applications.\n\n403\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.070\nNow when you think about that, that sounds\nlike a big long technical term, but\n\n404\n00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.675\nit really isn't.\n\n405\n00:21:39.675 --> 00:21:41.650\nIf you think about the idea of business,\n\n406\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:47.390\nit's software that you're gonna use during\nbusiness and getting your job done.\n\n407\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.950\nAnd then the idea of productivity is\nto make it much more efficient, and\n\n408\n00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.060\nthen of course it's software based.\n\n409\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.620\nNow when you start thinking about some\nof these different types of business\n\n410\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.230\napplication products.\n\n411\n00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.860\nNormally what that means is, there's\nactually several different products that\n\n412\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.850\nallow us to actually be more efficient\nthan the way we used to do things.\n\n413\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.610\nSo for example, let's talk about the idea\nof working with a typewriter today.\n\n414\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.480\nEven though you and I might,\nbecause of working with a computer,\n\n415\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.090\nwe could see the translation\nback to a typewriter.\n\n416\n00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:21.010\nBut if somebody were to put a typewriter\nin front of us we would probably still\n\n417\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:25.200\nfeel a little bit lost in how to get\nstarted and how to do everything.\n\n418\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.790\nAnd so\nour productivity wouldn't go up, okay?\n\n419\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.560\nBut in today's world we use\nthings like word processors,\n\n420\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.290\nthat's a business productivity app,\nthat allow us to actually be, well,\n\n421\n00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.260\nmore productive with our typing.\n\n422\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.840\nNot only can we actually put words across\non paper anymore, but we can change it and\n\n423\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.060\nmodify it and do several different things\nthat we actually need to as well, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.480\nAlong with that of course,\nis the idea of desktop publishing.\n\n425\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.490\nIt used to be at one point in time, if you\never set up a newsletter of some sort,\n\n426\n00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.400\nand a manual style of everything\nthat you did, it took a lot for\n\n427\n00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.600\nthat setup to actually\nwork on a typewriter.\n\n428\n00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.480\nAnd I know, cuz I used to do it\nmanually when I was in college.\n\n429\n00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.280\nI used to actually set\none of these things up.\n\n430\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.220\nThese little newsletters that I had.\n\n431\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.040\nBut at the same time,\nit's not very productive.\n\n432\n00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.790\nWell you can take that\nsame word processor and\n\n433\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.320\nmake it make three columns if you want to.\n\n434\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.520\nMake it flow from one page over to another\npage without you having to turn paper over\n\n435\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.640\nand do a whole bunch of different things.\n\n436\n00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.840\nAs a news typist, typesetter would\nhave to actually have to end up doing.\n\n437\n00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.260\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings you can do there.\n\n438\n00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.250\nAnd working with numbers.\n\n439\n00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.710\nYou might think about\na spreadsheet program\n\n440\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.730\ninstead of using columnar\npads that are out there.\n\n441\n00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.700\nAnd then manually having\nto add up numbers.\n\n442\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.910\nMost of these spreadsheet programs are\nfairly powerful in crunching numbers for\n\n443\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.670\nyou that you can use to help you\nto become much more efficient.\n\n444\n00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:48.410\nOf course there's also presentation\nsoftware as well as database programs.\n\n445\n00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.786\nAnd we're gonna see a lot more of\nthat business productivity in this\n\n446\n00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:57.259\nparticular key application exam test and\nseries that we're doing.\n\n447\n00:23:57.259 --> 00:24:00.259\nAnd we'll be spending a lot more time on\neach one of those types of applications\n\n448\n00:24:00.259 --> 00:24:01.536\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n449\n00:24:01.536 --> 00:24:04.056\nSo just realize that that is probably,\nby far,\n\n450\n00:24:04.056 --> 00:24:08.477\nthe one that's going to benefit you the\nmost as you start working with computings.\n\n451\n00:24:08.477 --> 00:24:12.970\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I've seen in some businesses\nwhere they have a lot of employees.\n\n452\n00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:18.055\nI can't even remember sometimes a handful\nof numbers, my kids' birthdays.\n\n453\n00:24:18.055 --> 00:24:21.390\nNow when you have a big business,\nright, or it could be a small business.\n\n454\n00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.310\nAnd they have a lot of employees,\n\n455\n00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.680\nhow are we gonna keep track\nof all of that information?\n\n456\n00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.565\n&gt;&gt; Well there's a lot of different\nways that we can do that, and\n\n457\n00:24:29.565 --> 00:24:33.140\na lot of times it's specialized\nsoftware or accounting software.\n\n458\n00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.230\nAnd they even have very highly specialized\nsoftware that may work only for\n\n459\n00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.810\nthat only one particular type of business.\n\n460\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.540\nSo don't just think that generic\nbusiness productivity is all about just\n\n461\n00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.250\nthe things that we do everyday.\n\n462\n00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.570\nFor us, if we're just getting started,\nit will be.\n\n463\n00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.620\nBut as you become more and\nmore specialized and\n\n464\n00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.410\nworking with your field\nin whatever you're doing.\n\n465\n00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.190\nYou'll find specialty\napplications that are out there\n\n466\n00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.520\nthat are really purpose driven,\nyou'll end up seeing that.\n\n467\n00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.550\nYou work for a tax firm,\nyou're gonna find tax software out there.\n\n468\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.520\nYou work for an accounting firm,\nyou'll find special accounting software.\n\n469\n00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.514\nYou work for a team in which does a lot\nof sales, whether it's cold calling or\n\n470\n00:25:09.514 --> 00:25:14.589\nanything else, you'll work with different\ntypes of customer management or\n\n471\n00:25:14.589 --> 00:25:16.169\nresource management.\n\n472\n00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:17.884\nNo, what they call it,\ncustomer relations management,\n\n473\n00:25:17.884 --> 00:25:19.430\nI couldn't remember what the word was.\n\n474\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.160\nCustomer relation management types of\nsoftware that will be out there for\n\n475\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.310\nyou, and those are highly specialized.\n\n476\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.510\nThat's all done around\nthe notion of productivity,\n\n477\n00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.270\ngetting you to work much more efficiently.\n\n478\n00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:34.210\nGetting you to work better with\nthe systems that are actually out there.\n\n479\n00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.630\nAnd that's kinda the key category\n\n480\n00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.810\nthat we're gonna be spending\na little bit more time and focus on.\n\n481\n00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.680\nBut there's other ones that\nare out there as well, okay?\n\n482\n00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.550\nSo when we start talking about\nthe purpose driven types of apps,\n\n483\n00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.720\noperating systems have been very good\nat doing this one thing, too, okay?\n\n484\n00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.980\nThey provide for you some functionality by\ntaking a look at what they expect users\n\n485\n00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.670\nwill want to do when they run something\nlike Windows 7 on their machines.\n\n486\n00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.910\nAnd they provide for you some of it.\n\n487\n00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.150\nThey don't provide for\nyou the most detailed nature of things so\n\n488\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.760\nthat you actually produce the most\nfantastic thing you've ever seen.\n\n489\n00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.870\nBut they provide for you at least a basic\nunderstanding of what has happened.\n\n490\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.790\nFor example,\n\n491\n00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.560\nthe idea of the Calculator feature\nthat you can find inside of Windows.\n\n492\n00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.210\nIt's a basic calculator, but\nthen they also added in the ability for\n\n493\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.550\nyou to change it in to\na scientific calculator.\n\n494\n00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.310\nThey added a little bit\nmore features to it.\n\n495\n00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.710\nThere are some things that are out\nthere that are really designed for\n\n496\n00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.430\nhigh end very specialized things.\n\n497\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.056\nSo let's take for\nan example the idea of photo editing.\n\n498\n00:26:38.056 --> 00:26:42.326\nNow if you've seen somebody that's really\ngood at it, and we have a marketing person\n\n499\n00:26:42.326 --> 00:26:45.490\nhere really good at working with\nsomething like Illustrator.\n\n500\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:50.120\nAnd the other program that she runs,\nI don't remember what it is, but\n\n501\n00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.920\nit allows us to essentially\nmanipulate photos.\n\n502\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.400\nWell, yeah, you can spend a lot of\nmoney on that, but you don't have to.\n\n503\n00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.090\nLet me show you what I'm talking\nabout on my screen, okay?\n\n504\n00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:04.670\nSo here on my computer, I went ahead and\nI downloaded a picture.\n\n505\n00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:09.440\nAnd I tried to think of something that\nabsolutely would be something nobody's\n\n506\n00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.630\nreally gonna get upset at,\nat least I hope not, okay?\n\n507\n00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.320\nWhich is a cute puppy, okay?\n\n508\n00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:19.188\nSo if I right click on that link right\nthere where it says cutepuppy behind it,\n\n509\n00:27:19.188 --> 00:27:22.690\nnotice my third option here is Edit.\n\n510\n00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.682\nAnd if I select that, well look at that,\n\n511\n00:27:25.682 --> 00:27:31.755\nit actually brings up a picture of a cute\npuppy, okay, right there on the screen.\n\n512\n00:27:31.755 --> 00:27:34.466\nAt least I think it's cute, look at that,\nthat thing's adorable, okay?\n\n513\n00:27:34.466 --> 00:27:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's my dog by the way,\nI am thoroughly offended.\n\n514\n00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So there you go,\n\n515\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:44.300\nthis particular picture, though, well,\nit's all about editing the photo.\n\n516\n00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.749\nLook, I can actually drag it\nout just a little bit, and\n\n517\n00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:49.102\nin a moment here,\nit doesn't allow me to do it.\n\n518\n00:27:49.102 --> 00:27:51.080\nNevermind, so I can't actually drag that.\n\n519\n00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.782\nSometimes you actually get it where the\nimage won't allow you to drag it out and\n\n520\n00:27:53.782 --> 00:27:56.140\nexpand it it any larger than it is.\n\n521\n00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:00.390\nBut then you can also be able to edit\nthis in a couple of different ways.\n\n522\n00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:04.880\nI can rotate the image, let's see\nif I can rotate that if I want to.\n\n523\n00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.990\nNow notice that this is not anything\nthat's what we would consider\n\n524\n00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:16.100\nthe biggest idea here, okay, of saying\nthat this a full photo editing suite.\n\n525\n00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.260\nBut notice the basic features are here for\nus, and\n\n526\n00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.090\nwe can even go in now and,\nlet me see if I can do this.\n\n527\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:28.630\nJust make a simple,\nat least I believe simple, here, meme.\n\n528\n00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.770\nSo everybody loves memes, so why not?\n\n529\n00:28:35.242 --> 00:28:38.821\nOops, I thought I chose the right color,\nI'm hoping I did.\n\n530\n00:28:40.984 --> 00:28:45.385\nLet's try a color number 2 here, all\nright, so we'll try it this way anyways,\n\n531\n00:28:45.385 --> 00:28:46.480\nall right.\n\n532\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.723\nSo I can't believe it's,\n\n533\n00:28:54.904 --> 00:28:58.368\nIt's only Monday!\n\n534\n00:28:58.368 --> 00:29:01.043\nThere we go, and\nlet me change the font size here so\n\n535\n00:29:01.043 --> 00:29:02.840\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n536\n00:29:04.128 --> 00:29:05.410\nLet me select it then change it.\n\n537\n00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.040\nI was hoping that that would allow\nme to change the font color, but\n\n538\n00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.350\napparently I can't actually\nchange the font color.\n\n539\n00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.470\nThere we go, let's try that.\n\n540\n00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:24.500\nYeah, that worked incredibly well, so,\nbut you can see here that there it is,\n\n541\n00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.450\nwe've got at least this picture.\n\n542\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.386\nAnd so now you can see where you might\nfind applications like that, and\n\n543\n00:29:31.386 --> 00:29:33.397\nthere's plenty of them out there.\n\n544\n00:29:33.397 --> 00:29:38.300\nAnd a lot of them actually are based\non what they actually do as well, okay?\n\n545\n00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.521\nSo when you're working with an image like\nthis that's generally a picture that\n\n546\n00:29:42.521 --> 00:29:43.977\nyou have available to you.\n\n547\n00:29:43.977 --> 00:29:49.480\nWhen you start to do this, this is what we\ncall a some type of bitmapped image, okay?\n\n548\n00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.010\nAnd it's also what is called\nraster graphic as well.\n\n549\n00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.775\nNow that idea of the raster\ngraph means that there's only so\n\n550\n00:29:55.775 --> 00:29:57.640\nmany pixels that are on here.\n\n551\n00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.450\nAnd as you continue to stretch something\nout, the computer will try and\n\n552\n00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.410\nfill in those gaps and try and\nmake it look like a single image again.\n\n553\n00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.940\nBut it's really guessing what that\nimage is actually going to be, and so\n\n554\n00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.990\nit will get blurry.\n\n555\n00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.940\nAnd if you go ahead and squish it in, it\nwill actually squeeze out some of that and\n\n556\n00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.650\nstill maintain that picture\nas much as possible.\n\n557\n00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:20.140\nAnd then when you try and pull it back\nout into the original size, it tries and\n\n558\n00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.690\nit fills it back in again.\n\n559\n00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.590\nThe more often you do that,\nthe blurrier the picture is going to get.\n\n560\n00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:30.090\nAnd so you have that ability, but just\nkinda realize you do have to be careful\n\n561\n00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.180\nwith things like the raster\ntypes of images.\n\n562\n00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.234\nBut I also want to show\nyou something else, here,\n\n563\n00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.796\ntoo, let me just take this as an example.\n\n564\n00:30:40.885 --> 00:30:44.683\nOkay, now here, on this one, it's not so\nmuch, does it really matter, but I'm just\n\n565\n00:30:44.683 --> 00:30:48.140\ngonna put it on this picture right here so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n566\n00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.760\nOn this one, though, it doesn't do that,\n\n567\n00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.170\nregardless of what size it is,\nit's not gonna lose any image.\n\n568\n00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.390\nOr anything else that we have here,\nas far as pixels go.\n\n569\n00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:03.700\nAnd that's because this is what is\nconsidered a vector graphic instead.\n\n570\n00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.000\nA vector graphic says, look,\n\n571\n00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.140\nI'm not actually storing\nexactly where every pixel is.\n\n572\n00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:13.420\nIt's actually doing it based off of\na mathematical calculation on what you do.\n\n573\n00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.240\nSo this allows you to be able to draw,\nand expand, and collapse, and\n\n574\n00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.970\ndo everything that you want to.\n\n575\n00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.380\nBut you will generally be dealing with,\nessentially,\n\n576\n00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.520\nthose two types of elements when you start\nworking with something like a picture\n\n577\n00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.930\ntype of graphic creation in\nanything that you do as well.\n\n578\n00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.899\nThere's also things like web editing or\nweb authoring page,\n\n579\n00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:37.119\nweb authoring software\nwhich I can't say [LAUGH].\n\n580\n00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:39.951\nTypes of software out there that\nallow you to create a webpage,\n\n581\n00:31:39.951 --> 00:31:42.920\nallow you to manipulate, and\ndo things like this as well.\n\n582\n00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.210\nSo there are a couple of different\nones as far as categories out there.\n\n583\n00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.473\nAnd this one is more specific to,\nlike I said,\n\n584\n00:31:49.473 --> 00:31:51.345\nmore of the graphics type of element.\n\n585\n00:31:51.345 --> 00:31:54.433\nI don't think that this is the most\ncomplicated one that's out there, but\n\n586\n00:31:54.433 --> 00:31:56.880\nthis is at least one of them\nthat we can think about.\n\n587\n00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.720\nBut there's plenty more for\nus to take a look at.\n\n588\n00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.494\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, Ronnie,\n\n589\n00:31:59.494 --> 00:32:04.227\nit does look like we've got a lot\nmore good information coming up.\n\n590\n00:32:04.227 --> 00:32:06.850\nBut judging by that clock it does\nlook like we're gonna have to go into\n\n591\n00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.360\na part two.\n\n592\n00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.170\nBut before we do, Ronnie, do you have any\nadditional words you'd like to put into\n\n593\n00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.220\nthat or are we gonna save that for\npart two?.\n\n594\n00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.730\n&gt;&gt; Well we're just gonna take a look at\nmore of these, so do be ready for that.\n\n595\n00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.010\nBecause it is encumbent upon us,\nas we start working,\n\n596\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.610\nwe're gonna see some different things.\n\n597\n00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:25.362\nBut overall, though, just be ready as\nyou get into that work environment.\n\n598\n00:32:25.362 --> 00:32:28.675\nYou are going to be dealing with, well,\nsome of these different applications.\n\n599\n00:32:28.675 --> 00:32:30.755\nAnd understanding at least\nthe basics is gonna help you out.\n\n600\n00:32:30.755 --> 00:32:33.305\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, we appreciate\nyou joining us in the studios here.\n\n601\n00:32:33.305 --> 00:32:36.745\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\ntake the time and wrap up here at ITProTv.\n\n602\n00:32:36.745 --> 00:32:40.317\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n603\n00:32:40.317 --> 00:32:41.295\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n604\n00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:42.115\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n605\n00:32:43.220 -->
