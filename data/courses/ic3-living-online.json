00:00:39.730\nenvironment or maybe home environment, or\nmaybe your youngsters, students out there,\n\n11\n00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.060\nin some kind of grammar schooling,\nyou need to learn a little bit more.\n\n12\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.130\nSo when we look at this, this is gonna\nreally just be based around some of these\n\n13\n00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.860\nbasic foundational skills that you need,\nto be competent\n\n14\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.305\ninside of an online type of environment\nand connected into networks.\n\n15\n00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:58.295\nAnd that's one of the things that we're\ngonna talk about and many things that\n\n16\n00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:02.855\nwe're gonna talk about inside of this\ntech skill as well go through it.\n\n17\n00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:06.530\nSkills ranging from communication\nnetworks and the internet.\n\n18\n00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.870\nAnd some of the ways that we can even\nconnect to those networks and connect to\n\n19\n00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.090\nthe internet out there in general\nfoundational communication technologies.\n\n20\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.080\nWhat are some of those\ntechnologies that we use today?\n\n21\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.130\nWell, things like email.\n\n22\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.540\nEmail is a very, very important Important\ncommunication technology that you should\n\n23\n00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.580\nhave a basic understanding inside of work,\nhome, school, the office.\n\n24\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.170\nHowever you would like to say that.\n\n25\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.060\nOther things too like social media.\n\n26\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.950\nSocial networking sites.\n\n27\n00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.530\nSome people maybe already have\na lot of knowledge in this.\n\n28\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.370\nBut, if you are one of those\nones that is just starting out,\n\n29\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.230\nregardless of what your skill level is,\n\n30\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.950\nentry level, this might be something that\nyou would consider taking a look at.\n\n31\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.650\nOther things like messaging services,\nwe're gonna look at things like\n\n32\n00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.770\ncalendaring and how that helps us in\neveryday, day to day activities as well as\n\n33\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.510\nthings like sharing calendars with other\npeople, and subscribing to calendars.\n\n34\n00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.850\nSo you can keep Interconnected\nwith your communications that way.\n\n35\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.350\nWe'll look at things, concepts like\nonline conferencing, which is a very,\n\n36\n00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.470\nvery prevalent thing out there across\nthe Internet and communication networks,\n\n37\n00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.560\nwhether you're connected\nto the Internet or not.\n\n38\n00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.180\nAnd we're gonna show you some\nof the basics around that.\n\n39\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.930\nSo if you are confronted\nwith those technologies,\n\n40\n00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.130\nat least you'll have a running\nunderstanding of them.\n\n41\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.140\nWe also look at things like\nstreaming what is streaming media?\n\n42\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.430\nWhat does that mean for us and\nwhat other ways that we can obtain,\n\n43\n00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.650\nwe can consume,\nwe can create that content if we need to.\n\n44\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.310\nAnd what that means for\nus in our day to day lives?\n\n45\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.080\nWe will talk every two about web browsing.\n\n46\n00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.807\nWeb browsing to some might be easy,\n\n47\n00:02:38.807 --> 00:02:42.319\nbut if you are just standing out this\nis gonna be a great place to learn some\n\n48\n00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.792\nof those basic concept around the web\nbrowsing concept technologies.\n\n49\n00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:48.295\nThat allows you to create you to create,\nlocate, and\n\n50\n00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:50.865\neven evaluate the content\nthat you might find online.\n\n51\n00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:56.125\nWe'll also look at things like,\nfor instance, the ethical\n\n52\n00:02:56.125 --> 00:03:01.285\nimpact of online internet,\nbrowsing if you will, or interactions.\n\n53\n00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:04.860\nWe'll look at things if you will, like\nthe Internet ethics, and what that means.\n\n54\n00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.610\nYou might hear concepts like netiquette,\nand what does that mean for me?\n\n55\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.440\nIf I am one of those ones that is, that\nare using some of these technologies, and\n\n56\n00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.750\nwhat is my impact on society if you\nwill as a whole, or an individual.\n\n57\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.160\nSo we've got a lot of those coming up,\nand a lot of that kind of technology and\n\n58\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.085\nconcepts in store for us.\n\n59\n00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:27.110\n&gt;&gt; Wes I know that this is Textco Show,\nbut\n\n60\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.980\nis there any type of exam that\nis also associated with this?\n\n61\n00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.180\n&gt;&gt; There is an exam that it\nsays it's associated with it.\n\n62\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.090\nHowever, we're not gonna be focused\nreally on the certification exam.\n\n63\n00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.980\nThis is something that if you\ndid want the certification,\n\n64\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.970\nyou didn't wanna look into it.\n\n65\n00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.630\nYou can look at Certiport.\n\n66\n00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.930\nCertiport is one of the one's\nthat provides these standards.\n\n67\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.050\nThe digital literary library,\nif I can say that.\n\n68\n00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Literacy library.\n\n69\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.379\n&gt;&gt; That's right and if you go up to\nthe Certiport website, you can find\n\n70\n00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.760\na Certiport authorized testing center\nif you do pursue a certification.\n\n71\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.940\nHowever, keep in mind that when\nit comes to our tech skill here,\n\n72\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.920\nwe're not gonna really be\nfocusing on the certification.\n\n73\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.420\nIf these are some of the technologies that\nyou think you're interested in and would\n\n74\n00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.135\nlike to know more, join us because we've\ngot more IC3-Living Online coming up.\n\n75\n00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:16.623\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:19.891\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and you're\nwatching the IC3 Living Online show,\n\n4\n00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:24.655\nwhere we're about to take a look into\nwhat the realm of getting connected and\n\n5\n00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:29.286\nunderstanding the idea of living in\na connected world and living online.\n\n6\n00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:31.657\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:32.701\nWes, welcome to our show.\n\n8\n00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:33.387\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:34.492\nPleasure to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:38.174\nThat's right, so we're gonna talk\nabout everybody's fun topic,\n\n11\n00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:40.025\nsomething known as the Internet.\n\n12\n00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:43.260\nYou might have heard about this before or\nmaybe not.\n\n13\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.550\nSo we're gonna talk about\nsome of the basics today.\n\n14\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.799\nAnd really,\nwhat does it mean when we say hey,\n\n15\n00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:49.824\nI'm gonna be connected to the Internet?\n\n16\n00:00:49.824 --> 00:00:52.874\nLet's go ahead and\nstart out talking about the Internet and\n\n17\n00:00:52.874 --> 00:00:55.140\nanother concept called the World Wide Web.\n\n18\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.580\nWhen we talk about\nthe Internet some people will,\n\n19\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.990\ntheir view of it might be as, hey,\nI'm gonna call it the World Wide Web.\n\n20\n00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.800\nI'm gonna call it the Internet,\nand is there really a difference?\n\n21\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.450\nWell, I guess it's really just more\nverbiage than it is anything else.\n\n22\n00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.640\nA lot of times,\nwhen we talk about the Internet,\n\n23\n00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.260\nit might be just browsing those\nwebsites that you connect to\n\n24\n00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.720\nif you've ever gone out to,\nlike social media sites as well.\n\n25\n00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.740\nInternet, largely speaking, is usually\nthe hardware behind our connections and\n\n26\n00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.160\nwhat you and I typically see, right?\n\n27\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.750\nIt's the Internet service\nproviders that we'll talk about.\n\n28\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.420\nIt's how we get connection.\n\n29\n00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.750\nIt's the cabling,\n\n30\n00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.820\nthis interconnected nature of all these\nnetworks across the world worldwide.\n\n31\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.800\nBut when we talk about the World Wide Web\nusually what we're talking about is what\n\n32\n00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.780\nis basically websites, right?\n\n33\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.080\nWhat do I see in the web browser,\nbecause not necessarily do we see\n\n34\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.570\nall of the Internet, of course,\nwhen we're just browsing to websites.\n\n35\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.280\nWe could connect to\ndifferent locations and\n\n36\n00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.010\nwe don't actually see\nan interactive nature to that.\n\n37\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.100\nSo when we talk about the Internet and\nthe World Wide Web,\n\n38\n00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.820\nwe're gonna use them kind\nof interchangeably here.\n\n39\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.990\nSo just understand that we're not\nreally talking about the hardware and\n\n40\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.760\nthe connectivity.\n\n41\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.860\nJust more of what you would see\nas an end user from day to day.\n\n42\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.050\nBasically, firing up that web browser.\n\n43\n00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, so\n\n44\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.170\nwhen we start talking about\nthe idea of getting connected and\n\n45\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.730\ngetting online, we need to understand\nat least the basics of how we do that.\n\n46\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.240\nSo what are some of the elements that\nare involved if I wanna say I want\n\n47\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.190\nto get connected?\n\n48\n00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.890\n&gt;&gt; Very good, so most of your,\n\n49\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.810\npretty much all of your connections\nare gonna be subscription-based.\n\n50\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.730\nYou say, well,\nwhat do you mean subscription-based?\n\n51\n00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.840\nWell, in order to actually\nhave a connection, right?\n\n52\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.276\nTo open up something, a software\napplication known as a web browser,\n\n53\n00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:46.283\nyou typically have to pay\nsome other company for\n\n54\n00:02:46.283 --> 00:02:50.363\naccess to the Internet, so\nit really is subscription-based.\n\n55\n00:02:50.363 --> 00:02:52.880\nNow, what do we do, who is it that we pay?\n\n56\n00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.430\nWe pay something, an entity called\nan Internet service provider, right?\n\n57\n00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.410\nYou might it hear it called ISPs and\nthere's many that we have,\n\n58\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.430\nfor instance, here in the Gainesville\nlocation where our offices are located.\n\n59\n00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.070\nWe have things like Cox Communication and\nGRU out there.\n\n60\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.310\nWell, these are companies that have laid\nthe groundwork that gives us access,\n\n61\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.280\nand we pay them a fee in\norder to get connected.\n\n62\n00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.720\nSo, what type of devices and\nwhat type of connections do we make?\n\n63\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.900\nWell, it used to be that it\nwould just be a simple computer\n\n64\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.320\nthat you would sit in front, you'd launch\nan application and in this application,\n\n65\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.700\nyou could start to visit things like\ndifferent textual information if you will.\n\n66\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.320\nBut today it's gone so\nmuch more than that.\n\n67\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.300\nWe have things like, for\ninstance, gaming, right?\n\n68\n00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.070\nCommunication, we're talking about, I can\ncommunicate with my family over great\n\n69\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.880\ndistances as well, and\nwe have all sorts of things.\n\n70\n00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.360\nEducational, legal, if you will,\nmedical-type information out there.\n\n71\n00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.170\nSo normally when we talk about\nthe Internet and net connectivity,\n\n72\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.460\nit's really about consuming the\ninformation out there that is available\n\n73\n00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.080\non many different networks.\n\n74\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.980\nWe just have to know how\nto gain access to it.\n\n75\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.460\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes you talked about having to pay\nlet's say an Internet service provider.\n\n76\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.510\nBut I just got a cellphone recently,\nlet me put it in that scenario.\n\n77\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.025\nAnd I'm not actually playing, paying,\nexcuse me, a service provider or\n\n78\n00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:18.755\nan Internet service provider, am I?\n\n79\n00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:21.845\nWhen I'm actually using my own\nsmartphone to get connected, or\n\n80\n00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.165\nam I actually doing that?\n\n81\n00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:24.675\n&gt;&gt; Well, it does depend, for sure.\n\n82\n00:04:24.675 --> 00:04:29.065\nIf you're talking about just cellphone,\nright, that is a completely different type\n\n83\n00:04:29.065 --> 00:04:31.775\nof network where it's\ncellular communications.\n\n84\n00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:34.450\nNow here's the thing where\nthey kind of blur and\n\n85\n00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.730\nthey kind of come together,\nis the fact that you typically have a data\n\n86\n00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.690\nplan that's associated with that\nsubscription on your cell phone.\n\n87\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.453\nSo it really depends on how\nyou're connecting, right?\n\n88\n00:04:43.453 --> 00:04:47.687\nIf we turn off things like data, can we\nstill communicate on our smart phones?\n\n89\n00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:51.090\nAbsolutely, but we're going across\na different type of network.\n\n90\n00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.630\nSo we can still gain access through\nsomething like your mobile device as well,\n\n91\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.370\nprovided you have a data plan.\n\n92\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.510\nAnd again, it comes back to the fact\nthat whoever is giving you that service,\n\n93\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.170\nyou're paying them for a data plan.\n\n94\n00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.804\nWhich transparently, thank goodness to\nyou, means their network's gonna connect\n\n95\n00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:11.999\nto all these various resources that we\ncan gain access to should we need them.\n\n96\n00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:16.029\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, I know that there's a lot of\ntimes when people start to tell me like,\n\n97\n00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.450\nyou need to go and\nvisit this particular link.\n\n98\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.780\nAnd they give me a name to visit.\n\n99\n00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.590\nSo let's take for\nan example, ITProTV, right?\n\n100\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.997\nSo they tell me, you need to go and\nsee www.itpro.tv.\n\n101\n00:05:27.997 --> 00:05:29.470\nWhat is that about?\n\n102\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.120\nWhy do I need to know that particular\nname to get anywhere or something?\n\n103\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.250\n&gt;&gt; That's another great question.\n\n104\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.960\nThink about this.\n\n105\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.190\nWe have millions and millions of different\ndestinations that we can reach, right?\n\n106\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.780\nBut I want you to think about a road map.\n\n107\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.740\nIf you need to find a location,\n\n108\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.800\nyou typically are using some\nkind of address, right?\n\n109\n00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.010\nStreet address?\n\n110\n00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.610\nAnd it has a certain format to it, right?\n\n111\n00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.310\nIt's got a street name, it's got\na house number, and then, in this case,\n\n112\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.280\na little more information.\n\n113\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.960\nWhat city you're located in, state right?\n\n114\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.220\nWell, it's really not too much\ndifferent out there on the Internet.\n\n115\n00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.757\nIn fact, you're gonna have to be able\nto find these different locations.\n\n116\n00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:10.310\nLet's say we have www.yourwebsite.com.\n\n117\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.250\nWell, what does that mean for me, right?\n\n118\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.510\nWhat does that mean in the context\nof trying to find a website?\n\n119\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.298\nAnd, again,\n\n120\n00:06:17.298 --> 00:06:21.250\nI use the term resource because it\ncould be downloading files, right?\n\n121\n00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.650\nSo it's all about the consumption\nof that information.\n\n122\n00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.500\nSo when when you talk about HTTP or you\ntalk about WWW, those lingoes that we see\n\n123\n00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.370\nadvertised a lot of times, what that is is\nthat's called a Uniform Resource Locator.\n\n124\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.472\nAnd what does it mean?\n\n125\n00:06:36.472 --> 00:06:38.460\nI want you to think resources again.\n\n126\n00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.010\nIf we have millions upon\nmillions of different resources,\n\n127\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.740\nhow is it that we gain access to them?\n\n128\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.250\nWell, just like a street address and\nfinding a destination,\n\n129\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.560\nwe have to plug an address,\nin this case an electronic address,\n\n130\n00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.580\nthat takes us to that resource\nthat we're looking for.\n\n131\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.763\nAnd we have to plug that\ninto the web browser.\n\n132\n00:06:54.763 --> 00:06:58.780\nWhat I mean by that is we have to\ntype it in, into the web browser.\n\n133\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.880\nSo that's one of the great things is that\n\n134\n00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.110\nwe can differentiate the different\nresources by the different addresses.\n\n135\n00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these addresses are very\nimportant because they're unique on\n\n136\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.470\nthe entire Internet.\n\n137\n00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.890\nSo when somebody does give you an address\nor they give you a business card or\n\n138\n00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.600\nthey write it down for\nyou that you need to visit that link.\n\n139\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.240\nWhat that actually gives you that ability\nto do is to type it into that address bar\n\n140\n00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.390\nin that browser and it takes you\ndirectly to get connected to that\n\n141\n00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.520\nweb server that's out there somewhere.\n\n142\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.480\nAnd then you can view the content that\nyou're seeing from that one web browser.\n\n143\n00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.910\nBut the majority of us, though,\nat times do not know exactly what our\n\n144\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.600\nURL that we're looking for\nis going to be a lot of times.\n\n145\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.610\nNow, when that ends up happening, Wes,\nwhat I need to know is what if I don't\n\n146\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.950\nreally have a notion, like I don't\nknow what my actual URL has to be.\n\n147\n00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.080\nWhat can I do to at least get close to\nfinding what I might be searching for?\n\n148\n00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.770\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, right?\n\n149\n00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.033\nIt's easy to get lost, and\nif you talk about millions and\n\n150\n00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:57.362\nmillions of locations, right?\n\n151\n00:07:57.362 --> 00:08:01.126\nYou're not gonna sit down and memorize\nthe maps that you're looking for, right,\n\n152\n00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:03.673\nto make sure I know exactly\nhow to get to every location.\n\n153\n00:08:03.673 --> 00:08:04.739\nYou're gonna do what?\n\n154\n00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:06.629\nYou're gonna search for a location, right?\n\n155\n00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:08.454\nIf you're driving to a destination,\n\n156\n00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:12.040\nyou don't know the exact address of\nthe destination, what am I gonna do?\n\n157\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.360\nWell, I'm gonna look for\n\n158\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.560\na little magnifying glass\nsomewhere in that software.\n\n159\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.502\nAnd I'm gonna plug in something\nthat might be located, right,\n\n160\n00:08:19.502 --> 00:08:22.860\nhelp me get approximately\nwhere that destination is.\n\n161\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.370\nSo what we use to find our\nresources out there across\n\n162\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.190\nthe world wide web, and\nif we don't know the exact name or\n\n163\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.866\nsomething called search engines,\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n164\n00:08:33.866 --> 00:08:40.620\nSo I've got, on my Windows 7 machine, I've\ngot a web browser opened up right now,\n\n165\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.750\nand let's say that I need to get\nto ITPro TV's website right.\n\n166\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.500\nThey got resources that I wanna,\nI wanna look at, I wanna be able to view,\n\n167\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.780\nbut I don't know ITPro TV's website.\n\n168\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.130\nWell how would we find that out?\n\n169\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.450\nWhat we can use what's known\nas a search engine, and\n\n170\n00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.330\nlook at this little box right here okay?\n\n171\n00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:04.550\nThat box is where you enter the text for\nwhat you wanna search.\n\n172\n00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.620\nNow what are we saying when we say search?\n\n173\n00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.890\nWhat are you actually entering?\n\n174\n00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.940\nWell, to get close when you don't\nknow the specifics of the address,\n\n175\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.990\nyou use something known as keywords.\n\n176\n00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.380\nKeywords are those very specific,\nthey can be two words, but\n\n177\n00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.370\na lot of times they're just a single word,\nvery specific word that can give you\n\n178\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:27.230\nan approximation of what or\nwhere you are looking for.\n\n179\n00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.010\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n180\n00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.990\nIf I type in to the Google search engine,\n\n181\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.790\nlet me back out here just a little bit,\nmake sure I'm in the right location.\n\n182\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.480\nI do ITPro.\n\n183\n00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.260\nAnd then we do TV.\n\n184\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.140\nNow, like Ronnie said,\nwell I didn't know the address.\n\n185\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.430\nSo so, what can I do?\n\n186\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.710\nWell, all I did was searched.\n\n187\n00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.940\nRight?\nI used something known as a search engine.\n\n188\n00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.550\nThis is somebody else's computers that\nare, could be a bunch of them, and\n\n189\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.090\nusually it is and they're all working\ntogether and they're checking listings.\n\n190\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.250\nI want you to think of\nchecking the phone book right?\n\n191\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.140\nIf I know that there are addresses in\nthe phone book and I need to find maybe\n\n192\n00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.970\nsomebody's name or number, I look in that\nphone book and it's got these listings.\n\n193\n00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.580\nWell search engines do\nclose to the same thing.\n\n194\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.480\nIt's electronic information now but\nthey've got a lot\n\n195\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.190\nof data that they search through trying\nto locate these different keywords, and\n\n196\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.780\nmatch them up to what they believe\nyou might be searching for.\n\n197\n00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.310\nIn fact this one got really\nspecific just by using one keyword.\n\n198\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.760\nNow I can go a little bit further.\n\n199\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.150\nBut notice how the icon changes as I\nmove it from one side to the other.\n\n200\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.730\nWhat is, why is it going from\nthis arrow to this little hand,\n\n201\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.270\nI guess you will,\nwith one finger open, right?\n\n202\n00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.260\nWell, that's something\nknown as a hyperlink, okay.\n\n203\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.860\nHyperlinks are important to understand\nthat these are navigation tools to\n\n204\n00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.820\nhelp us get to those resources.\n\n205\n00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.090\nNotice that under here is\nan example of an address, right.\n\n206\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:54.390\nThere is the address that we\ntypically type up here in the field.\n\n207\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.270\nWhen we're browsing here,\nlet me see if I can get up there.\n\n208\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.520\nNotice this long crazy address?\n\n209\n00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.770\nWell this is the crazy address for\nthe search engine I just used, and\n\n210\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.793\nif I wanted to I could type address in,\nbut for Ronnie's question,\n\n211\n00:11:06.793 --> 00:11:08.560\nhe said well what if we don't know?\n\n212\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.490\nAnd that's where this hyperlinks\ncombine with the search engines come in\n\n213\n00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.110\nhandy that I can clink on that and\nI didn't have to type\n\n214\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:21.170\nthis URL or address to find\nthe resources that I wanted to use.\n\n215\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.340\nIn this case, it's what's known\nas a webpage or a website.\n\n216\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.130\nNow I want to mention that term website,\nwebpage, what are we talking about?\n\n217\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.290\nWell, not really too much different.\n\n218\n00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.190\nA lot of times they're\nused interchangeably.\n\n219\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.780\nLike a website could be comprised\nof multiple webpages, right?\n\n220\n00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.690\nJust depends on where\nyour point of landing is.\n\n221\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:42.220\nSo please understand that a website\nis ultimately where we're going so\n\n222\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.920\nwe can view that information\ninside of the browser.\n\n223\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.980\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, when we start to search for\n\n224\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.150\nthings because we don't know exactly what\nwe're looking for, the great thing is\n\n225\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.450\nthese search engines actually have\na lot of extra utility to them.\n\n226\n00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.130\nNot just searching for keywords, but\nthey've already categorized some things\n\n227\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:04.240\nfor us that we can actually use to help\nus to not see every single word that's\n\n228\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.332\nout there, because sometimes we can get\nover inundated with too much information.\n\n229\n00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:12.240\nSo Wes, show us some of those different\nways that we can make our search\n\n230\n00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.020\nmuch more effective.\n\n231\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n232\n00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.020\nSo what I'm going to do here is,\n\n233\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.480\nI'm going to do a little bit of\nnavigation of the web browser.\n\n234\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.580\nAnd what's great, is to get back to what\nRonnie's talking about, we can look at\n\n235\n00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.020\nsome of the other components that\nare inside of this application.\n\n236\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.820\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n237\n00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.580\nFirst of all, I want to talk about\nthese buttons right here, and\n\n238\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.830\nthey're a little different depending\non web browser you're using but\n\n239\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.680\nfor the most part, they all have this.\n\n240\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.380\nNotice that we have the back and\nthe forward button.\n\n241\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.670\nAnd then we're gonna have this\nlittle circle right here.\n\n242\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.280\nThis little circle is called\nthe refresh button and what that does,\n\n243\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.390\nlet me go ahead and\ncheck that out real quick.\n\n244\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.620\nIt refreshes the webpage and\nit might update it, if for\n\n245\n00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.830\nsome reason maybe you're\nhaving a problem with it.\n\n246\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.830\nThis little button right here\nis known as the home button.\n\n247\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:56.611\nAll right, the home page takes me\nto the page that I want to open up\n\n248\n00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:59.790\nevery time I launch this web browser.\n\n249\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.270\nBut let me show what\nRonnie was asking about.\n\n250\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.400\nI'm gonna hit the back button, we're gonna\nnavigate back to that search engine.\n\n251\n00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.140\nAll right, now I want you to notice\nacross the top here, notice that there's\n\n252\n00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.750\nthese different categories if you will,\nkinda like Ronnie was mentioning here.\n\n253\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:19.510\nNotice it says All, it says News,\nsays Videos, says Shopping, and Images.\n\n254\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.700\nWhat if I decided that, hey,\n\n255\n00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.640\nI didn't wanna go to the ITPro TV website,\nmaybe I wanted some kind of image.\n\n256\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.110\nMaybe I wanted to find out, hey,\nwhat does the ITPro TV logo look like?\n\n257\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.430\nWell, I can narrow the search down, right?\n\n258\n00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.060\nAnd when I say narrow the search down,\nI don't know if\n\n259\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.210\nthey still give you statistics,\nyeah they give you statistics here.\n\n260\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.640\nAll right,\nthis is what he was mentioning here.\n\n261\n00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.255\nNotice it says about 290,000 results,\n\n262\n00:13:45.255 --> 00:13:49.395\nwell you better have some time\nif you wanna find one specific.\n\n263\n00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:51.175\nLet's do that,\nlet's get a little more specific.\n\n264\n00:13:51.175 --> 00:13:54.715\nSo we're gonna leave inside\nof the search engine that\n\n265\n00:13:54.715 --> 00:13:58.405\nkey word I was talking about and\nwe're gonna choose image.\n\n266\n00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:01.175\nNow I want you notice what happens here.\n\n267\n00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:06.270\nNotice it isn't showing me webpages\nanymore, or the hyperlinks, right?\n\n268\n00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:11.500\nNow what we have are these images in\ngeneral but now just like on a web page,\n\n269\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.140\ngraphics can be clickable likewise too.\n\n270\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.070\nSo, you could have or you visit\na website and there is an image of,\n\n271\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.560\nI think Ronny is used to another\nepisodes of cute puppy, right?\n\n272\n00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.800\nAnd I could click on that cute puppy,\nand then what does it do?\n\n273\n00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.530\nIt opens me to another location,\n\n274\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.380\nnavigating further through whatever\nwebsite you're looking at.\n\n275\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.740\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n276\n00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.660\nWhen I click on the ITPro TV logo here,\nnotice how something else opens up.\n\n277\n00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.540\nThat's what they mean when\nthey say clickable field.\n\n278\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.230\nSo not only like hyperlinks,\nalso images can be clickable here, too.\n\n279\n00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.910\nSo that, and\nthat's just one example, right?\n\n280\n00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.090\nWe can do all kinds of\ndifferent searches here, right?\n\n281\n00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:52.110\nMaybe I want to, for\ninstance, I like drawing.\n\n282\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.080\nAll right.\nSo maybe I say drawing is my keyword\n\n283\n00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.340\nin pencil.\n\n284\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:04.390\nAll right and am not going to leave\nto images, now I wanna find out\n\n285\n00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:09.840\nis there a video out there that can maybe\nhelp me to learn how to draw in pencil?\n\n286\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.700\nWell, now click videos now.\n\n287\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.800\nAgain, let me zoom in here so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n288\n00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.730\nNotice the video category.\n\n289\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.210\nAnd I could click that.\n\n290\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.360\nAnd now it takes me out and\nit's kinda interesting.\n\n291\n00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.195\nITProTV.\n\n292\n00:15:21.195 --> 00:15:25.570\n[LAUGH] Notice that I said,\nlet me do that one more time,\n\n293\n00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.840\ndrawing, I didn't know that we\noffered that, but who knows.\n\n294\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.070\nWe very well could.\n\n295\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.960\nDrawing in pencil.\n\n296\n00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.750\nAlright.\n\n297\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.640\nIf I can spell pencil that\nwould be doing great.\n\n298\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.240\nNow notice that what comes\nup has been basically\n\n299\n00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.140\nisolated down to videos themselves, right?\n\n300\n00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.240\nNow these are what are known\nas search results.\n\n301\n00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.610\nAll right,\nsearch results are the results for\n\n302\n00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.580\nthe key word that you enter\ninto the search field.\n\n303\n00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.832\nAnd I also want you guys to look\nall the way down at the bottom.\n\n304\n00:15:55.832 --> 00:15:59.682\nSee, when you you get a lot\nof different results,\n\n305\n00:15:59.682 --> 00:16:04.282\nnotice there's too many to put\nin one single webpage here.\n\n306\n00:16:04.282 --> 00:16:07.993\nSo, you can also do a little\nnavigation right here as well saying,\n\n307\n00:16:07.993 --> 00:16:09.866\nhey I wanna see what are the next.\n\n308\n00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:14.031\nSuch and such results,\nhowever many results.\n\n309\n00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:16.680\nNow you can go a little bit\nmore advanced than that.\n\n310\n00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.250\nWe have images, we have video,\nwe have things like shopping.\n\n311\n00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.800\nWe also have other search engines.\n\n312\n00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.520\nIn this case I've just\nbeen using the Google\n\n313\n00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.670\nsearch engine because it's\none of the more famous ones.\n\n314\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.980\nBut is that the only search\nengine that you have?\n\n315\n00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.810\nDo you have flavor?\n\n316\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.650\nDo you have availability, variety?\n\n317\n00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.855\nWell, you do.\n\n318\n00:16:32.855 --> 00:16:37.240\nWell right now search results vary\ndepending on who you're searching with.\n\n319\n00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:37.910\nBut for instance,\n\n320\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.400\nthere's another one out there that\nMicrosoft's got called Bing, right?\n\n321\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.470\nAnd if I go to Bing, notice that very\nfamiliar as far as the basic layout goes.\n\n322\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:52.220\nAll of those individual categories that\nwe're talking about are up here, right?\n\n323\n00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.150\nThen they have this search history.\n\n324\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.200\nWhat are you doing?\n\n325\n00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.040\nAre you searching the History Channel?\n\n326\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.270\nThat's not what that means.\n\n327\n00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.510\nWhat it means is you might have used\nthis multiple times and typically we do.\n\n328\n00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.620\nSo if you want to enhance\nyour productivity,\n\n329\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.230\nyou can reapply searches\nthat you've done before.\n\n330\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:13.300\nBut if you'll notice,\nif I turn around and I say maybe ITProTV.\n\n331\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.320\nAnd here's another thing\nthat can overlook.\n\n332\n00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.760\nWhat is going on right here,\nwhat's happening?\n\n333\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.640\nWhy are they dumping all\nthis text on our screen?\n\n334\n00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.920\nThese are search results.\n\n335\n00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.930\nSo they can help assist you even more so\n\n336\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.280\nwhen we don't know exactly what we're\nlooking for or if you're like Wes and\n\n337\n00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.620\nyour typing abilities are so\ngood this really comes in handy.\n\n338\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.340\nAnd again I could do ITProTV.\n\n339\n00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.050\nNotice, for the most part,\nsearch results will change.\n\n340\n00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.890\nThe overall layout or\ntheme might change a little but,\n\n341\n00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.200\nbut ultimately the underlying\nfunctionality doesn't.\n\n342\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.550\nAgain, I've got hyperlinks.\n\n343\n00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.210\nAnd when we look at the ITPro.TV,\n\n344\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.910\nnotice that this will take\nme to the main website.\n\n345\n00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:00.350\nBut then we have all these different\nadditional locations that we can go to.\n\n346\n00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.680\nAnd that's why I tell you a website,\nwebpages,\n\n347\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.900\neven though they're used\nkinda interchangeably,\n\n348\n00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:09.680\na website is usually a collection of\nmultiple webpages under a single name.\n\n349\n00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.000\nAll right, so we've got that too.\n\n350\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.120\nAnd then we can go even more\nadvanced if we really need to.\n\n351\n00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.170\nMaybe I decide that I wanted,\nwe'll go back to the image search right?\n\n352\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.170\nI wanted the ITProTV logo.\n\n353\n00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.930\nIf you remember us just doing that, we'll\nget back to that original search right?\n\n354\n00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.998\nBut I want you to notice that there's\nalso what are known as Search Tools here.\n\n355\n00:18:28.998 --> 00:18:32.950\nAnd again these differ from for a little\nbetween different web browsers but for\n\n356\n00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.060\nthe most part, they're gonna be\nrelatively the same all right?\n\n357\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.170\nSo we can go to Search Tools and\nnow I get even more advanced.\n\n358\n00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:47.000\nI say, not only am I looking for an image\nbut maybe I'm looking for a medium image.\n\n359\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.730\nAnd instantly in selecting that,\nwhat happens?\n\n360\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.500\nIt comes back and it says let me look for\n\n361\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.030\nall the images that we can find that\nhave been cached in that listing.\n\n362\n00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.170\nRemember how I was talking about\nkind of like a telephone book,\n\n363\n00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.250\nin that listing, that meet the criteria.\n\n364\n00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.690\nMaybe I want to do something like usage\nrights, we're gonna talk about licensing\n\n365\n00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:09.240\nin another episode, but I can find out,\nlabelled for re-use and modification.\n\n366\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.620\nSo maybe I do wanna use this image, but\n\n367\n00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.450\nI certainly don't wanna have\nany copyright infringements.\n\n368\n00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.197\nWell I can make sure,\nwell kind of assist that,\n\n369\n00:19:17.197 --> 00:19:20.022\nin finding out which ones are labeled for\nreuse.\n\n370\n00:19:20.022 --> 00:19:23.610\nSo, does give you\nthe advantage to do that too.\n\n371\n00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.190\nThere's other additional things too,\nlike Map and News,\n\n372\n00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.320\nthat we haven't talked about.\n\n373\n00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.370\nYou can see News right here in this case,\nfor Google.\n\n374\n00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.260\nMaps, Books, Flights.\n\n375\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.220\nImagine that.\n\n376\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.200\nYou wanna find a flight?\n\n377\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.470\nWell I can plug it in to\nthe search imagine here and\n\n378\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.770\nI can hit go and then I can find the local\nairports and what those flights are.\n\n379\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:47.500\nSo, a lot of great information as long\nas you know how to isolate it down.\n\n380\n00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.270\nNow what is going on here?\n\n381\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.170\nYou know, what is this?\n\n382\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.030\nWhen we say navigation and\nwe say an application.\n\n383\n00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.810\nWell the application that we're\ntalking about is this right here.\n\n384\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.310\nThis is a web browser.\n\n385\n00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.620\nAnd what's going on is your web\nbrowser is actually communicating\n\n386\n00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.460\nwith another computer out there.\n\n387\n00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.840\nIt's saying, hey,\nI need a resource, essentially.\n\n388\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.400\nCan I have this file?\n\n389\n00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.420\nAnd through the navigation and\nthe address that we were talking about.\n\n390\n00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.550\nIt goes out, it finds that resource,\nit talks to that computer, and\n\n391\n00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.270\nin this case we're just using a example.\n\n392\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:21.290\nThere's probably one called\nyourwebsite.com as many websites are as\n\n393\n00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:21.790\nout there.\n\n394\n00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.590\nBut that website, or that computer\nsays sure you can have this file.\n\n395\n00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.670\nHere it is.\n\n396\n00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.260\nAll right?\n\n397\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.155\nAnd then it comes back\nto your computer and\n\n398\n00:20:30.155 --> 00:20:35.540\nthe web browser displays it in what we\nsee, what we're looking at right now.\n\n399\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.010\nIt displays the webpage.\n\n400\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.140\nSo that's what's going\non in the background, so\n\n401\n00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.335\nkeep that in mind, all right?\n\n402\n00:20:42.335 --> 00:20:45.660\nNow the next thing I kinda\nwanna talk about when we\n\n403\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.700\ntalk about Internet navigation and\nusage is a little bit about safety.\n\n404\n00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.830\nOne of the things you're gonna wanna\nmake sure that when you're browsing\n\n405\n00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.830\nlike we're talking about, you want to\nmake sure that you have antivirus.\n\n406\n00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.570\nWe always have to have some\nkind of antivirus software.\n\n407\n00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.600\nA piece of software on our computer\nthat ensures, well it can't ensure but\n\n408\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.380\nit helps to make sure that\nif I visit a website and it\n\n409\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.630\ndoes give me that file back cuz I'm asking\na question, that it's not a file that's\n\n410\n00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.710\nmaliciously taking over our computer\ndoing something that we don't want to do.\n\n411\n00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.690\nThe other thing that I\nalso want to mention and\n\n412\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.390\nthis is very important especially\ncuz I'm a father, I have kids and\n\n413\n00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.510\nsome of you guys might have\nkids out there, is a box that,\n\n414\n00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.960\nin this case, we got to check\nout on our search engine here.\n\n415\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.880\nThis is a concept of a Safe Search, right?\n\n416\n00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.710\nIf you have kids or\neven yourselves, right?\n\n417\n00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.870\nBecause there are so\nmany different results that\n\n418\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.590\ncan be fed back into this application,\nsome of those results you might not\n\n419\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.780\nwant being shown to things like little\nkids and that's one of the great things.\n\n420\n00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.600\nKeep in mind that\nthe Safe Search is another way\n\n421\n00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.338\nto kinda ensure a little bit more\nsafety online as you're navigating.\n\n422\n00:21:59.338 --> 00:22:06.300\nAll right, I think one of the last things\nI'll mention here is a concept known,\n\n423\n00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.450\nif you'll notice, we have a string\nof letters right here, right?\n\n424\n00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.440\nhttps, in this case.\n\n425\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.100\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n426\n00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.610\nIs that alphabet soup?\n\n427\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:16.880\nWell, not really.\n\n428\n00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.640\nRemember when I told you that you're\nasking a question to that computer and\n\n429\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.330\nyou're saying, hey computer,\ncan I have that file?\n\n430\n00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:27.760\nWell, this is the communication\nthat's going on in the background.\n\n431\n00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.240\nAnd these are what is known as protocols.\n\n432\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.240\nBut protocols just means that it\ndefines how we ask the question.\n\n433\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.410\nWell, if we see HTTP,\nit means when I ask that question,\n\n434\n00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.100\nit's kind of like standing up in a food\ncourt and standing on the table and\n\n435\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:46.140\nyelling out to the whole entire room,\nhey I need that file.\n\n436\n00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.070\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n437\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.250\nIt means everybody else can\npotentially see my question and\n\n438\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.420\nwhat's being given back to me.\n\n439\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.040\nWhen you put the s on the end of it,\n\n440\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.940\nyou actually add a little bit of\nconfidentiality in your question.\n\n441\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.350\nWhat you're saying is,\ngive me that file but\n\n442\n00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.960\ngive it to me in a way that nobody\nelse in the food court can see, and\n\n443\n00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.020\nthat's another thing that can\nhelp safety so keep that in mind.\n\n444\n00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:15.760\nWhen we talk about antivirus, make sure\nthat you're searching a safe search.\n\n445\n00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.650\nIf you wanna be truly safe,\nmake sure that you're using https.\n\n446\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.710\nAnd first and foremost,\n\n447\n00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:26.230\nmake sure that if you click on a link,\nyou trust where it's going.\n\n448\n00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.740\nBecause there's nothing that says\nthat that link has to take you\n\n449\n00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.600\nto the appropriate location.\n\n450\n00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.960\nSo make sure that when you visit these\nsites, it is a site that you trust.\n\n451\n00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Now there's no doubt Wes,\n\n452\n00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.050\nthat you have to actually be very\ncareful with this type of searching.\n\n453\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:46.520\nBecause not every single link that\nyou see may deliver you to the exact,\n\n454\n00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.030\ncorrect website that you're looking for.\n\n455\n00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.510\nPeople can spoof the address,\nin other words, they can take over\n\n456\n00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.910\nthat name even though it's supposed to\nbe unique out there on the Internet.\n\n457\n00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.730\nOne of the big examples of this\nare people that are trying to get you\n\n458\n00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.480\nto go to a bank account of some sort.\n\n459\n00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.132\nAnd they give you the name of your bank.\n\n460\n00:24:04.132 --> 00:24:07.522\nWell they can come close but\nthey can't give you the exact name.\n\n461\n00:24:07.522 --> 00:24:10.597\nAnd it seems like that all you have\nto do is click on that link and\n\n462\n00:24:10.597 --> 00:24:11.672\nit brings you there.\n\n463\n00:24:11.672 --> 00:24:16.405\nWell companies end up using something\nlike the HTTPS that's associated with\n\n464\n00:24:16.405 --> 00:24:19.316\nsomething that is unique\nthat can be verified,\n\n465\n00:24:19.316 --> 00:24:22.760\nlike a driver's license\nverified by your government.\n\n466\n00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.940\nSome type of government ID as well.\n\n467\n00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.555\nAnd that way when you connect to that\nserver, you essentially say, hey,\n\n468\n00:24:28.555 --> 00:24:31.527\nprove to me that you're the server\nthat I need to connect to,\n\n469\n00:24:31.527 --> 00:24:34.881\nand they will give you a copy of that\nthat actually be able to verify.\n\n470\n00:24:34.881 --> 00:24:39.324\nNow at some sites so that may seem to\nlook exactly like the same website,\n\n471\n00:24:39.324 --> 00:24:40.893\nit may not do that at all.\n\n472\n00:24:40.893 --> 00:24:45.410\nAnd so now it looks legitimate, but\nyou may not be connected to the real one.\n\n473\n00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.600\nSo you do need to be careful and\n\n474\n00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.970\nonly think about the idea here of\nrealizing that you're getting that result.\n\n475\n00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.960\nSo you do have to take a look\nat those searches, verify and\n\n476\n00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.350\nnever click on links that somebody just\nsends you through the email as well,\n\n477\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.730\ncuz you don't ever know\nexactly what's going on there.\n\n478\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.610\nNow Wes, are there any other features that\nwe need to think about in terms of our\n\n479\n00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:06.470\nbrowser?\n\n480\n00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.280\n&gt;&gt; There is some basic navigation.\n\n481\n00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.697\nJust basic functionality inside of\nthe browser that we wanna talk about.\n\n482\n00:25:11.697 --> 00:25:15.428\nNow some of them we've already mentioned\nso it'll be pretty much a repeat,\n\n483\n00:25:15.428 --> 00:25:16.610\nlike that term browse.\n\n484\n00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.510\nAll right, you might heard here\nsomebody say, browse to ITProTV.\n\n485\n00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.720\nWell, what do they mean?\n\n486\n00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.890\nAre you out there, you're looking,\nyou're getting on some binoculars?\n\n487\n00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.900\nNo, what that means is the process of\nentering the address in the address bar,\n\n488\n00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.840\nor using the search engine,\nlike we're talking about,\n\n489\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.460\nif you don't know the address, and then\nclicking on that link, and it takes you,\n\n490\n00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.420\nfor instance on my computer here,\nto ITProTV, right?\n\n491\n00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.080\nThat's browsing to the webpage.\n\n492\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.360\nSo it is important to know that.\n\n493\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.360\nA connection, right?\n\n494\n00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.340\nAre you connected to the website,\nsomebody might say?\n\n495\n00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.170\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n496\n00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.180\nAnd that quite literally means when we're\ntalking about, connecting to your internet\n\n497\n00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.540\nservice provider who then turn\nconnects you to that website.\n\n498\n00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.170\nSecure?\n\n499\n00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.280\nWe've mentioned security.\n\n500\n00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.580\nRonnie just mentioned security\nabout our banks, right?\n\n501\n00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.280\nOur banking information,\n\n502\n00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:09.460\nmaking sure that you're using something\nlike HTTPS can help with the security.\n\n503\n00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.050\nThe other term that I'd like you\nto know is pop ups, all right?\n\n504\n00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.640\nThese are things that can happen as\nyour browsing, remember that term,\n\n505\n00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.080\nbrowsing the Internet.\n\n506\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.170\nAll right, these are these little windows\nthat will start to pop up on your desktop,\n\n507\n00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.720\nand they can be kind of annoying\nsometimes, and certainly can be malicious.\n\n508\n00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.780\nWell, the great thing is most of your\nmodern web browsers have integrated\n\n509\n00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.450\nwhat is known as a pop-up blocker in them,\nso that's a great thing.\n\n510\n00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.490\nNow the other thing I want to kind\nof look at too is on the right side,\n\n511\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:41.870\nif we look at our web page here,\nnotice that we have this little bar.\n\n512\n00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:42.670\nWhat is that bar?\n\n513\n00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.580\nWell, that's called a scroll bar,\nand that's what we say when we say,\n\n514\n00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.560\nhey scroll down.\n\n515\n00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.320\nWell what do you mean scroll down,\nunroll the papyrus scroll?\n\n516\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.480\nBut no, what that means is how\nyou're viewing the webpage.\n\n517\n00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.353\nIt means take that scroll bar up and\ndown, all right?\n\n518\n00:27:00.353 --> 00:27:05.530\nNow there's one other thing that we have\ntoo, and I'm in Internet Explorer now.\n\n519\n00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.420\nWhat is this little star, right?\n\n520\n00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.080\nThe little star, if I go ahead and click\non it, that's what's known as Favorites.\n\n521\n00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.990\nNow there are quite a few different terms\nfor Favorites, or a few different terms I\n\n522\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.620\nguess I should say for Favorites, you\nmight see some people call them bookmarks.\n\n523\n00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.920\nOther people calling Favorites,\na lot of times are used interchangeably.\n\n524\n00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.700\nWell what does it mean?\n\n525\n00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.190\nIt means I like this website more\nthan anybody else in the world?\n\n526\n00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.485\nNot really, it just means that you\nprobably view that website on a daily\n\n527\n00:27:29.485 --> 00:27:32.700\nbasis, so you want to make sure\nyou get to it a lot easier.\n\n528\n00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.200\nI don't have to type an address, and I\ndon't even have to use the search engine.\n\n529\n00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:42.260\nSo it allows for a more efficient and\neasy browsing to the website.\n\n530\n00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.040\nHow about history?\n\n531\n00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.050\nWhat does history mean for us?\n\n532\n00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.860\nWell remember what I told you.\n\n533\n00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:53.020\nHistory is basically\na storing of the websites\n\n534\n00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:57.090\nthat you have recently viewed,\nand it does assist us, right?\n\n535\n00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.198\nIt helps to make us more productive,\nif you will,\n\n536\n00:28:00.198 --> 00:28:05.156\nwhen we're doing our searching, but\nit also lends itself to potentially maybe\n\n537\n00:28:05.156 --> 00:28:09.163\nstoring information in this\napplication that you don't want.\n\n538\n00:28:09.163 --> 00:28:14.069\nSo the different web browsers allow you to\nfind the settings where you can actually\n\n539\n00:28:14.069 --> 00:28:17.692\nmanage this history and\nwhat you can is you can as you can see,\n\n540\n00:28:17.692 --> 00:28:22.840\nlook at browsing history, again, remember\nthat time browsing's gonna come a lot.\n\n541\n00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.920\nIt just means navigating to the website.\n\n542\n00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.934\nAnd I can actually delete those if I want.\n\n543\n00:28:26.934 --> 00:28:30.418\nAnd you can see there is all different\ntypes of settings, but keep in mind that\n\n544\n00:28:30.418 --> 00:28:34.276\none of the reasons you might wanna perform\nwhat am doing right there, deleting them,\n\n545\n00:28:34.276 --> 00:28:37.652\nnot only does it help you, but anything\nthat helps you sometimes has a con,\n\n546\n00:28:37.652 --> 00:28:39.228\nif you will, that goes behind it.\n\n547\n00:28:39.228 --> 00:28:42.149\nAnd the fact that it's storing\nmaybe a little more information\n\n548\n00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:43.910\nthan you might want.\n\n549\n00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.740\nThe other thing that I wanna\nmention to you is the zoom, right?\n\n550\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.090\nI've been zooming here with the native\n\n551\n00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.480\naccessibility option\ninside of my computer.\n\n552\n00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.690\nHowever, if I want to I can zoom in and\nout of the browser.\n\n553\n00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.040\nHere, let me close that down, and\nyou'll notice the zoom option.\n\n554\n00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.600\nNow, some some computers\nthat have like touch\n\n555\n00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.540\npads allow you to do what's\nknown as a pinch, right?\n\n556\n00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.200\nAnd then a stretch, and that's basically\njust a gesture that you can do on a touch\n\n557\n00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.370\npad that allows you to zoom in and\nzoom out.\n\n558\n00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.840\nSometimes, you might have to do\nit manually and see what it does.\n\n559\n00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.440\nIt makes it easier for\nyou to view that webpage.\n\n560\n00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.930\nSo just some of the basic terms there,\nRonnie, that we might want to understand.\n\n561\n00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.300\nIf it is the fact that you're\ngonna be browsing to the websites,\n\n562\n00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:33.065\nif you're gonna be using the Internet,\ndon't let it overwhelm you.\n\n563\n00:29:33.065 --> 00:29:35.295\nKeep in mind,\nthere's a lot of terms out there.\n\n564\n00:29:35.295 --> 00:29:38.365\nBut if you can get some of the handful\nof basics under your belt,\n\n565\n00:29:38.365 --> 00:29:40.145\nyou could be doing really good, and\n\n566\n00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:43.995\nit's gonna make sure that that experience\nis a little bit more enjoyable.\n\n567\n00:29:43.995 --> 00:29:47.285\n&gt;&gt; These are some of the different things\nthat we definitely need to pay attention\n\n568\n00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:52.055\nto as we begin this idea of making\nsure that we're connected online, and\n\n569\n00:29:52.055 --> 00:29:55.745\nunderstanding how to use the web\nbrowser as well as the search engine.\n\n570\n00:29:55.745 --> 00:29:59.960\nIt's gonna be some of the key basic tools\nthat you need to understand as you begin\n\n571\n00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:05.615\nto have more presence on the internet, as\nwell as work with different companies too.\n\n572\n00:30:05.615 --> 00:30:08.140\nWell Wes, any last words before\nwe close out this episode?\n\n573\n00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.990\n&gt;&gt; No, sir.\nI think that's got it, thank you.\n\n574\n00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:14.489\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're gonna go ahead and\ndo that and end this episode.\n\n575\n00:30:14.489 --> 00:30:17.870\nFor ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n576\n00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:18.785\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n577\n00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:23.732\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore IC3 Living

00:00:19.640\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and you're\nwatching the IC3 Living Online show,\n\n4\n00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.240\nwhere we're about to take a look at,\nwell, dealing with email.\n\n5\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.620\nReally about any company's\nlifeblood communication\n\n6\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.470\nis dealing with the idea\nof working with email and\n\n7\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.010\nwe need to understand this\ninner workings a little bit.\n\n8\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.377\nAnd also, of course, how we actually\naccess it and the whole bunch more and\n\n9\n00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:37.790\nhere to help us out is Mr.\nEmail himself, Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.220\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n11\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.260\n&gt;&gt; And thanks for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.850\nI'll tell you I've had enough\nproblems in my life with email.\n\n13\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.130\nI don't know if I'm Mr. Master yet, but\nwe're gonna hope that it works well for\n\n14\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.210\nus here and that's for sure.\n\n15\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.140\nAnd that's what we're\nlooking at is the email,\n\n16\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.350\nso we're gonna talk\nabout a few more things.\n\n17\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.728\nSome of or a few things here, some of the\nthings that we're gonna look at are what\n\n18\n00:00:56.728 --> 00:00:59.422\nare the different email clients\nthat are available out there.\n\n19\n00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:02.040\nWe're also gonna talk about\nsomething known as etiquette when it\n\n20\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.090\ncomes to sending your emails.\n\n21\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.872\nTo make sure that you don't have to print\nyour resume at the end of the day because\n\n22\n00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:10.137\nmaybe you didn't send\nthe right type of email.\n\n23\n00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:12.933\nAnd we're not really gonna look at it so\n\n24\n00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:17.593\nmuch from a business standpoint and\nsetting up email accounts and\n\n25\n00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:22.270\nstuff like that, but we definitely\nwanna show you a ways around.\n\n26\n00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.600\nSo one of the things to keep in mind\nis that when it comes to gaining access\n\n27\n00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.830\nto email, you gotta couple different\nplatforms if you will I'll say.\n\n28\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.840\nOne that we use typically in a home\nenvironment or in a personal environment.\n\n29\n00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.420\nWell, that's really based on another\ntopic that we talked about touch\n\n30\n00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.870\nbase on cloud-based technologies, right?\n\n31\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.680\nIt's that offering that's known\nas software as a service where\n\n32\n00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.910\nsomebody else's managing all\nthe hardware in the background.\n\n33\n00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.810\nAnd all we really have to do is well, fire\nup a web browser, connect to the platform,\n\n34\n00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.530\nlog in with the user account,\nand then we're off to the races.\n\n35\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.100\nWe're ready to go ahead and start\ncomposing and sending or receiving and\n\n36\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.230\nviewing our email.\n\n37\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.610\nHowever, the other one that you'll\nhave in the business environment.\n\n38\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.810\nAnd I'm sure as time progresses this'll\nstart becoming less and less as the cloud\n\n39\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.910\ngets bigger and bigger is that you have\nalso what's known as on-premise email.\n\n40\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.250\nAnd that's where your\nsystems administrator or\n\n41\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.250\nan administrator is managing the computer\nthat sends and receives the email.\n\n42\n00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.350\nAnd then all the software and\nthe headaches and problems and\n\n43\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.580\nfun stuff that goes along with managing\nand maintaining and email server.\n\n44\n00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.475\nSo again, what we'll be looking at\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Wes, when we start taking\n\n45\n00:02:31.475 --> 00:02:35.790\nlook at the idea of email, we've now\nunderstand just a little bit that there\n\n46\n00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.750\nis gonna be some type of server in\nthe background that's handling the email.\n\n47\n00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.980\nBut here it is I am now working for\na company and\n\n48\n00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.240\nI need to be able to gain\naccess to email itself.\n\n49\n00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.640\nWe need to understand more about the idea\nof what's gonna be on my machine and\n\n50\n00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.900\nwhat I'm gonna see, and\nwhat is that product actually called, and\n\n51\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.350\nwhat are some examples of it?\n\n52\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.340\n&gt;&gt; Very good and good question,\nan email client, right?\n\n53\n00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.160\nWhen it comes to email in general,\n\n54\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.510\nwe have what's known as\na client-server relationship.\n\n55\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.720\nAnd what that basically means is that my\ncomputer is asking where is a place that\n\n56\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.560\nI can send out on the network, whether\nit's the Internet or the business network.\n\n57\n00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.630\nWhere can I send this email?\n\n58\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.955\nI got this message, I gotta send it,\nwho do I send it to?\n\n59\n00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:17.740\nAnd that's where the server in\nthe background is gonna say you\n\n60\n00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.780\nneed to send an email?\n\n61\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.830\nWell, that's what I do here.\n\n62\n00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.260\nBut as far as the end user goes,\nwe really don't see all that.\n\n63\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.644\nLet me show you what we actually see, I've\nactually got a Microsoft account here.\n\n64\n00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:32.760\nAnd this is outlook.com, so\nthis is a free email client here,\n\n65\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.100\nbut this is essentially what we see.\n\n66\n00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.870\nWe see a log in screen, right?\n\n67\n00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.990\nAnd when we decide that we're gonna\nsign in, what it does provided that\n\n68\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.320\nyou've typed your password correctly here,\nit logs you into the interface.\n\n69\n00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.080\nAnd when you see there's not,\nI mean it really is,\n\n70\n00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.210\ndepending on what subscription\nlevel you might have,\n\n71\n00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.480\ndepending on who you maybe pay for\nyour email or in this case, it's free.\n\n72\n00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.240\nYou could see that there'll be different\nfeatures, different functionalities, but\n\n73\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.740\nfor the most part, here's what we see.\n\n74\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.138\nOn the left hand side, I have what\nare known as folders, what's a folder?\n\n75\n00:04:05.138 --> 00:04:08.840\nWell, in a previous episode, we did talk\nabout a little bit about what folders are.\n\n76\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.680\nIn this case, what a folder does is\nit groups my emails together and\n\n77\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.818\nwe do have a series of default folders.\n\n78\n00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:19.800\nI'm gonna kinda go out of order here on\nyou, Ronnie, and jump the track here.\n\n79\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.610\nWe have on the left hand side these\nfolders and there are default ones that\n\n80\n00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.685\nare kinda stock before we even\nstart receiving or sending email.\n\n81\n00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:32.550\nSo for instance, if I zoom in here and you\ncan kinda see what we have here, right?\n\n82\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.990\nNotice, I have my inbox.\n\n83\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.660\nWell, what is my inbox?\n\n84\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.680\nWell, when let's say\nRonnie sends me an email.\n\n85\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.250\nWhen Ronnie sends me an email, it's gotta\nhave some kind of first place staging\n\n86\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.000\narea that it goes, so that I have quick\naccess to the emails that are coming in.\n\n87\n00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.410\nHence the term inbox.\n\n88\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.070\nIf I have any emails that have been sent\nto me, they're gonna show up right here.\n\n89\n00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.320\nIn fact, If I decide that maybe I want to\ngo ahead and compose an email and send\n\n90\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.170\nit and I'll show you what I'm doing here,\nbut let me show you how the inbox works.\n\n91\n00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.070\nAnd we're also gonna get into some\ncontacts that I'm using right here, so\n\n92\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.400\nyou can see what all this means.\n\n93\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.200\nWe'll clarify this in just a second.\n\n94\n00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.240\nAnd we'll go ahead and say Test Email and\n\n95\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.681\nwe'll compose here, just say,\njust testing the inbox.\n\n96\n00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.450\nAll right, we'll fire that email off and\n\n97\n00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.350\nhopefully, hopefully,\nwhat's happening in the background is that\n\n98\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.920\nthis information is being sent to that\nemail server that we were talking about.\n\n99\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.130\nNow it's looking in listing saying hey,\nwhere do I send this?\n\n100\n00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.310\nAnd then it's finding who to contact here.\n\n101\n00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.650\nAnd finally, hopefully, if we switch\nover here, I can see sure enough,\n\n102\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.820\nright there, in the Inbox,\nnotice that I had this message, right?\n\n103\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.705\nAnd in case this message is an email,\nthis specific type of message, and\n\n104\n00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:50.460\nnotice that it's kind of\nhighlighted if you will.\n\n105\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.250\nNotice the bold text right here.\n\n106\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.753\nTypically, what that means, and you can\nsee right here with the numeric identifier\n\n107\n00:05:56.753 --> 00:05:59.310\nright here, in this case number 1 because\nit's the only one I have in here.\n\n108\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.350\nIt's letting me know that not only\ndo I have an email in my inbox, but\n\n109\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.340\nI have an unread email, all right?\n\n110\n00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.690\nSo the inbox is a really good\nplace basically as a starting\n\n111\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.960\npoint to find the emails that\nessentially you haven't looked at yet.\n\n112\n00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.550\nBut does that mean it's\nonly unread emails?\n\n113\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.990\nWell, not necessarily,\nlet me just show you what I mean here.\n\n114\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.110\nI can actually, if I wanted to,\njust go ahead and double click on this.\n\n115\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.470\nAnd when I do,\nit opens up the email, right?\n\n116\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.090\nAnd well, there's not a lot\nof elaborate text in here.\n\n117\n00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.960\nAnd you guys that have seen some of\nthe other episodes know my impeccable\n\n118\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.860\ntyping skills, so we'll keep it simple.\n\n119\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.480\nBut there's the message that's been sent.\n\n120\n00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.018\nAnd what's happening in the background?\n\n121\n00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:43.030\nWell, basically,\nit's going from network to network and\n\n122\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.500\nwe didn't have to deal with it, right?\n\n123\n00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.378\nThat's one of the good things\nabout software as a service again,\n\n124\n00:06:47.378 --> 00:06:49.835\nsomebody else is managing and\nmaintaining that.\n\n125\n00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:52.305\nKeep in mind though that if you\nare in a business environment,\n\n126\n00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:54.325\nit would be your administrators,\nthe IT staff,\n\n127\n00:06:54.325 --> 00:06:57.445\nthat would be helping to\nadminister the first jump, right?\n\n128\n00:06:57.445 --> 00:07:02.060\nThe first mailbox, if you will, that\nthis email goes to is really just like\n\n129\n00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.450\nyour mail carrier, it's gonna be\nthe server on your network, all right?\n\n130\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.025\nSo that is a little bit\nabout the inbox and\n\n131\n00:07:09.025 --> 00:07:11.020\nkinda looking through some\nof these folders here.\n\n132\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.190\nAnd I've actually got a couple\nof email clients open, so\n\n133\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.170\nyou can see the compare and\ncontrast, right?\n\n134\n00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.433\nYou say okay, well,\nthat is Outlook, right?\n\n135\n00:07:17.433 --> 00:07:20.920\nWell, what does it look like let's say\nin another common one, Gmail, right?\n\n136\n00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.897\nWell, let's go ahead and switch over to\nGmail and see if it's much different.\n\n137\n00:07:24.897 --> 00:07:27.807\nAnd if you'll notice right here,\nnotice it says Inbox, right?\n\n138\n00:07:27.807 --> 00:07:30.950\nI don't really see too much\ndifference between these two, so\n\n139\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.830\nit does have a basic set of features.\n\n140\n00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.507\nI will tell you that sometimes\nwhat does change is if I open up,\n\n141\n00:07:36.507 --> 00:07:39.665\ndo the Less button here,\nnotice how this says Spam?\n\n142\n00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:44.560\nWell, depending on what e-mail carrier\nyou have, you might call it spam.\n\n143\n00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.524\nIn this case,\nyou might also see it called Junk Mail.\n\n144\n00:07:47.524 --> 00:07:51.359\nThat's just a naming convention there\njust keep that in mind, all right?\n\n145\n00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:55.286\nBasically, spam or junk mail, if you will,\nis just a form of mail that's unsolicited.\n\n146\n00:07:55.286 --> 00:07:56.737\nYou didn't ask for it.\n\n147\n00:07:56.737 --> 00:08:01.620\nSomehow, maybe there's some inner workings\nof privacy policies in other companies.\n\n148\n00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.503\nThey got access to your email and\n\n149\n00:08:03.503 --> 00:08:07.697\ndecided that they want to advertise\na lot of Christmas sweaters to you.\n\n150\n00:08:07.697 --> 00:08:10.121\nSo they start sending\ninformation to you and\n\n151\n00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:12.946\nit makes its way through\nwhat are known as filters.\n\n152\n00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:16.800\nAnd again, just a little part of\nthe software program that says this isn't\n\n153\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.450\nan email that you requested so\nwe'll put it here.\n\n154\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.870\nSo that's your spam or junk mail.\n\n155\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.390\nWe've got drafts as well.\n\n156\n00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.510\nWell, what are drafts?\n\n157\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.390\nWell, one of the things that we want\nto keep in mind with drafts, in fact,\n\n158\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.860\nI think I still got one here,\nis if you're working on an email and\n\n159\n00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.170\nwe'll talk a little bit about\nthe etiquette coming up too.\n\n160\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.630\nBut if you're working on an email and\n\n161\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.960\nlet's say that I didn't finish the email,\nit'll go into what's known as a draft.\n\n162\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.120\nI didn't finish it\nmeaning I didn't send it.\n\n163\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.150\nAll right, and I could see that I do\nhave one here in my draft location.\n\n164\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:51.250\nAnd if I click,\nthere's a little red text there.\n\n165\n00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.240\nYou can't really tell it because it's not\nblue like when it was in the inbox, but\n\n166\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.480\nthat's actually a clickable field and you\ncan tell by the little hand right there.\n\n167\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.440\nAnd if I was to click on this,\nand back out.\n\n168\n00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.130\nYou can see my draft is right here.\n\n169\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.520\nAll right,\nnow what if I decide that in my inbox,\n\n170\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.410\nI don't want this message\nanymore that's right here.\n\n171\n00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.010\nAll right, well what I have the ability\nto do, and we'll show you this in Outlook\n\n172\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:18.850\ntoo, is that I can click on it, and now,\nnotice that it's more contextual, right?\n\n173\n00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.400\nNotice that if I don't click\nthis this menu changes right?\n\n174\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.120\nThis is a refresh option and I want to you\ncan say mark all as read and that makes it\n\n175\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.230\neasy if you've got a lot of emails in\nyour inbox that you don't want to read.\n\n176\n00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.585\nBut notice that I've got the ability\nthat I can move this to folders,\n\n177\n00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:36.315\nif I've created folders.\n\n178\n00:09:36.315 --> 00:09:38.075\nI've also got the ability to mark it.\n\n179\n00:09:38.075 --> 00:09:41.415\nI can mark it, I can report it as spam,\nmaybe this wasn't something that,\n\n180\n00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.885\nit made into my inbox and\nthe spam filter, as they call it,\n\n181\n00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:47.405\njust a little software that says\nthis is good, this isn't good.\n\n182\n00:09:47.405 --> 00:09:51.015\nMaybe it got a little aggressive and\novershot the runway on that one, and\n\n183\n00:09:51.015 --> 00:09:53.080\nit threw it into the message.\n\n184\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.910\nOr threw it in my inbox and\nit didn't classify it as spam.\n\n185\n00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.790\nWell I can actually report it, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.430\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and delete this,\nall right, when I do that,\n\n187\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:07.085\nI can't really see it here but\nnotice there's a trash option.\n\n188\n00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:13.565\nThe trash option is where you find\nemails that you have deleted, all right.\n\n189\n00:10:13.565 --> 00:10:15.645\nYou can also customize folders and\n\n190\n00:10:15.645 --> 00:10:19.645\nagain it's really no different\ninside of Outlook here.\n\n191\n00:10:19.645 --> 00:10:24.465\nIf I was to check this, notice that\nthis doesn't change at all again some\n\n192\n00:10:24.465 --> 00:10:28.850\nminor variation on the client\nitself I choose Delete, it's gone.\n\n193\n00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.190\nAnd notice it doesn't say trash on this\none but it does say Deleted Items.\n\n194\n00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.750\nAll right so\nyou have to be gonna be careful on it.\n\n195\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.630\nWhen you first get used to mail client an\nemail client of you will, gotta get used\n\n196\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.180\nto wherever their naming conventions is\ncause it might differ just a little bit\n\n197\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:48.470\nbut now I can delete this permanently if\nI want and you'll notice as well, too.\n\n198\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.390\nWhat I like about some of these email\nclients is when you delete something\n\n199\n00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.780\nthey do have a staging\narea in the background.\n\n200\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.480\nNot all email clients, some of them\ndo have a little staging area.\n\n201\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.480\nThey're saying,\nare you sure you really wanna delete this?\n\n202\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.200\nWe'll hold onto it for just a little bit.\n\n203\n00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.330\nYou can recover it if you want to.\n\n204\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.674\nBut I never rely on that at all,\nall right.\n\n205\n00:11:05.674 --> 00:11:08.908\nAll right so that's a little bit about\nwhen it comes to email management,\n\n206\n00:11:08.908 --> 00:11:10.590\nthat's a little about your folders.\n\n207\n00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.450\nNow we did wanna talk a little\nbit about composing and\n\n208\n00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.870\nlike I said then we're gonna kinda double\nback around and we'll talk a little bit\n\n209\n00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.266\nabout the etiquette behind\nsending emails and stuff as well.\n\n210\n00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:24.260\nSo we'll go ahead and\ntalk about composing an email.\n\n211\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.100\nIf I wanna compose an email,\ncouple of different places, in this case,\n\n212\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.410\nyou could see right up here it says New.\n\n213\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:36.480\nI could push that if I'm in Outlook,\nit just basically says Compose.\n\n214\n00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.290\nWe've been looking at Outlook's little\nCompose dialogue box with the draft.\n\n215\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.660\nLet's see what it looks like,\nexcuse me, in Gmail.\n\n216\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.610\nSee what it looks like in outlook,\nall right.\n\n217\n00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.990\nNotice that again I've got this little\nextra dialogue box that comes up.\n\n218\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.792\nAlright.\nNow the two fields.\n\n219\n00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:57.360\nAll right, when we talk about the To field\nthat is exactly what it sounds like who am\n\n220\n00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.210\nI sending this to, all right.\n\n221\n00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.000\nAnd this is a clickable field and\n\n222\n00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.050\nwhat it takes you to is another\ncomponent that's within your\n\n223\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.490\nemail system that's very very convenient\nand handy and that's called contacts.\n\n224\n00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:13.350\nAll right now, with this one,\nI don't have [LAUGH] any contacts so\n\n225\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:18.860\nif I was to set up an email, I would\nhave to actually know the email address.\n\n226\n00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.720\nSo, let me go and set me,\nmyself an email address.\n\n227\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.317\nI could type in the name here and\nif your a part of a large organization\n\n228\n00:12:26.317 --> 00:12:30.916\nthat might have contacts in another\nlocation already ready to go and\n\n229\n00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:36.829\nthen what you're doing is just searching\nthrough that I'm gonna do wes@itpro.tv.\n\n230\n00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:38.410\nAll right, I'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n231\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.568\nNotice it asks me,\ndo you wanna use this one?\n\n232\n00:12:40.568 --> 00:12:44.480\nAnd if I wanted to, I can always close\nthis out and I could start over right.\n\n233\n00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.430\nI could also add let's say,\n\n234\n00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.549\nif I did Ronnie@itpro.tv.\n\n235\n00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:57.139\nNow I'm not going to bother Ronnie\ncuz I certainly don't want his\n\n236\n00:12:57.139 --> 00:13:01.730\nemail flagged as spam now or\nsomething like that and broadcast his\n\n237\n00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.736\nemail to this email client, but\nnotice that I can now send this email but\n\n238\n00:13:06.736 --> 00:13:11.020\nI do have a couple other things\nthat I need to consider.\n\n239\n00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.620\nAll right, my subject line.\n\n240\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.151\nThis is my subject, all right.\n\n241\n00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:19.821\nSometimes when you go to send an email and\nyou don't have a subject line,\n\n242\n00:13:19.821 --> 00:13:22.708\nit warns you about that, and\nagain as part of etiquette,\n\n243\n00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:25.958\nyou should have some kind of subject\nthat allows the recipient to\n\n244\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.530\nknow that just as a quick heads up,\nwhat is this email about?\n\n245\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:35.290\nNow what if I decided that I wanted\nto send this email to somebody but\n\n246\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.640\nI wanted somebody else to just\nbe aware of it, all right?\n\n247\n00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.040\nNow, we gotta be careful with this\none too cuz there's an etiquette to\n\n248\n00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.800\nusing this as well.\n\n249\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.480\nAnd this is what's known as carbon copy,\ncc.\n\n250\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.370\nNow carbon copies are kinda disappearing\ntoday in the electronic age.\n\n251\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.430\nBut think about what a carbon copy is.\n\n252\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.600\nIf you're not aware of it,\n\n253\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.380\nremember you've probably seen this when\nyou're signing a receipt, if you will.\n\n254\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.300\nIf you ever go to a mechanic's shop and\nthey print you out a receipt.\n\n255\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.950\nWhat do they do?\n\n256\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.060\nThey have multiple layer copy.\n\n257\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.800\nAnd in the middle this is like this\ndark layer, right, it could be black,\n\n258\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.350\ncould be blue depending on\nthe carbon that they're using.\n\n259\n00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.380\nAnd when you write on it you\nput your signature on it.\n\n260\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.750\nWhat does it do?\n\n261\n00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.530\nIt leaves a copy underneath right and\nit leaves your signature so\n\n262\n00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.210\nwhen they rip it off you get a copy and\nsomebody else has a copy.\n\n263\n00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.030\nWell maybe I want Ronnie to be\naware of this subject, right?\n\n264\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.000\nWhatever the email is, I choose cc.\n\n265\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.590\nNotice that I now have a second email\nline here that I can add, right?\n\n266\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:33.130\nAnd at this point I could type in\nRonnie@ and you can see here is the,\n\n267\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.610\nthis is actually a history and\nI could select that.\n\n268\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.660\nAnd now that just means that when I\nsend this email to myself in this case\n\n269\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.500\nRonnie's gonna get a copy of it as well.\n\n270\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.100\nNow, let's talk a little bit about\nthe etiquette on a carbon copy.\n\n271\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.070\nKeep in mind what I'm doing here.\n\n272\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.014\nIf I'm sending this email,\nin this case I'm sending it to myself but\n\n273\n00:14:52.014 --> 00:14:55.686\nlet me say that I'm sending this\nemail to some outbound person,\n\n274\n00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:59.170\nwell what do they also see now\nthat I might not want to happen?\n\n275\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.633\nThey also see Ronnie's email.\n\n276\n00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:05.592\nSo for privacy concerns, you have to kind\nof ensure that you want other people\n\n277\n00:15:05.592 --> 00:15:10.094\nto see the emails, right,\nbecause I've known people to just copy and\n\n278\n00:15:10.094 --> 00:15:15.040\npaste, if you will, a whole list\nof email addresses in that cc.\n\n279\n00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.150\nBut what if some of those email addresses\nare supposed to be just internal and\n\n280\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.390\nyou don't really want customers\noutside viewing them.\n\n281\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.640\nOr in this case,\nmaybe you're in a home environment.\n\n282\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.370\nNow you're giving your\nfriend's emails out and\n\n283\n00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.280\nall you were doing is trying to copy\nsomebody in and you really thought\n\n284\n00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.580\nyou were doing them a justice but\nactually doing them an injustice.\n\n285\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.569\nSo there's a way that you can\nhandle that if you want to and\n\n286\n00:15:34.569 --> 00:15:36.574\nthat's the other one here, the BCC.\n\n287\n00:15:36.574 --> 00:15:41.329\nBCC is blind carbon copy and what that\nmeans is that I decide that whoever I'm\n\n288\n00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:44.990\nsending this to I don't want\nthem to see Ronnie's email.\n\n289\n00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.744\nI'll put it here, right.\n\n290\n00:15:46.744 --> 00:15:50.282\nBecause blind carbon copies says yeah,\nI still want Ronnie to get a copy but\n\n291\n00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.723\nwhoever I'm sending it to, I don't\nwant them to see his email address.\n\n292\n00:15:53.723 --> 00:15:57.296\nThat also lends itself\nto etiquette as well.\n\n293\n00:15:57.296 --> 00:16:00.516\nBecause if you're doing this and you're\njust trying to do this behind somebody's\n\n294\n00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:02.620\nback, it could turn around and\nbite you so.\n\n295\n00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.660\nAgain, there is a little bit of etiquette\nto using the carbon copy and the Bcc.\n\n296\n00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.970\nSometimes they say, well,\nI wanna email the boss or\n\n297\n00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.120\nemail something to somebody and\nI want the boss to see it, right?\n\n298\n00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.590\nYou're just making sure you're covering\nyourself, covering all your bases.\n\n299\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.380\nWell, that in and\nof itself could be annoying and\n\n300\n00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.770\ncould be bad etiquette as well,\nso do be aware of that.\n\n301\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.290\nNow that's a little bit\nabout the composing.\n\n302\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:32.960\nIn this case, I'm gonna leave this\njust to myself and I'll do test email.\n\n303\n00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.020\nAnd we'll go ahead and we will send it.\n\n304\n00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:43.080\nAll right, now notice that it says,\ncouldn't send\n\n305\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.930\nthe following message, and it says, verify\nyour account to help us stop spammers.\n\n306\n00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.970\nOkay, so this is something they don't want\nsomebody just signing up for an email and\n\n307\n00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.160\nstarting to email everybody\nelse in the world.\n\n308\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.380\nSo this is a second-level verification\nthat I need to do to make sure that\n\n309\n00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.610\nI'm not some kinda person trying to spam,\nin this case, myself.\n\n310\n00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.560\nAll right, so\nthat's not always gonna happen.\n\n311\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.224\nAgain, keep that in mind.\n\n312\n00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:10.270\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ndiscard it now, and we'll let that go.\n\n313\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.240\nNow the next thing I wanna do is\nI'm gonna actually go ahead and\n\n314\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.210\nI'm gonna right-click.\n\n315\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.780\nAnd there are some right-click options.\n\n316\n00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.210\nI deleted this,\nit went to my trash, right?\n\n317\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.140\nAnd I decided that, hey,\nI don't wanna delete this.\n\n318\n00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.198\nIn fact, I wanna send this to Ronnie.\n\n319\n00:17:24.198 --> 00:17:27.100\nRight, I received the email\nfrom somebody else but\n\n320\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.640\nI really need Ronnie to look at it too.\n\n321\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.708\nWell, I can choose forward, all right.\n\n322\n00:17:30.708 --> 00:17:33.950\nNow notice that the forward\ndidn't really change too much.\n\n323\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.140\nWe still have pretty much\nall the same up here.\n\n324\n00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.920\nThe to field, the Cc field and\nthe Bcc field, but notice the Fw in front.\n\n325\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.230\nThis means that if Ronnie\nwas to get this at the time,\n\n326\n00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.580\nhe would know that it originally went\nto me, or it went to somebody else.\n\n327\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.280\nNow again, there is a little bit of\nan etiquette to forwarding as well.\n\n328\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.030\nSometimes, people can just copy a whole\nlist and they forward it to everybody.\n\n329\n00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.520\nBefore you know it, you have this\nstring of email addresses and\n\n330\n00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.010\nyou're either giving out information or\n\n331\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.950\nyou're making it really difficult\nto see what the original email was.\n\n332\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.150\nThey call it an email thread and\nthat could be annoying too.\n\n333\n00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.920\nAll right, we pretty much\ntalked about deleting a file or\n\n334\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.840\nexcuse me, deleting an email.\n\n335\n00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.890\nAll right, we talked about forwarding,\nthe Bcc and Cc.\n\n336\n00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:25.060\nThe next thing I would also want to\ntalk a little bit about is attachments.\n\n337\n00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.080\nLet me go ahead and I'll discard this.\n\n338\n00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.190\nWe've been in Outlook here, let's\nkinda switch back up to the other one,\n\n339\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.870\nin this case Gmail,\nkinda to give you an idea of that one too.\n\n340\n00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.690\nI'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna go to\nCompose here and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n341\n00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:42.960\ntype my email in, wes@itpro.tv.\n\n342\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.350\nSubject is test.\n\n343\n00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.860\nNow what happens if I decide that I\nhave a document that I wanna send,\n\n344\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.420\na file that I wanna send.\n\n345\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.140\nWell, that's what's\nknown as an attachment.\n\n346\n00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.400\nAnd with this icon it's a little bit hard\nto see, cuz my head's covered it up.\n\n347\n00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.090\nIt is a little paper\nclip icon right there.\n\n348\n00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.920\nAll right, that's common to adding\nattachments, it seems like today,\n\n349\n00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.549\nall right.\n\n350\n00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:08.324\nAnd you can see that some other\nattachments I can insert a photo if I\n\n351\n00:19:08.324 --> 00:19:09.020\nwant here.\n\n352\n00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.680\nThis is the formatting options as well.\n\n353\n00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.410\nBut I really, really care about this\nlittle paper clip icon, all right, and\n\n354\n00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.190\nnotice what it's doing.\n\n355\n00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:21.190\nIt's saying, okay, Wes,\nyou wanna send some information or\n\n356\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.660\nyou wanna attach a file to this?\n\n357\n00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.470\nSo I select the file, choose Open and\nyou can notice, down here on the bottom,\n\n358\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.220\nthat it's actually, it has attached it.\n\n359\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.950\nNow notice that it has a file\nsize beside it, right, 8K.\n\n360\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.030\nThat's not really that much,\nit's 8 kilobytes, not a big file.\n\n361\n00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:41.010\nHowever, I will tell you,\nwhen you get things like bigger files,\n\n362\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.940\nPDFs can sometimes be several megabytes.\n\n363\n00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.500\nAnd certain email clients\nthat you will use,\n\n364\n00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.130\nthey don't wanna send\nall that information.\n\n365\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.890\nAnd they certainly might not even want\nyou storing it on their server so\n\n366\n00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.670\nthey will do what is known\nas a size limit, all right?\n\n367\n00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.340\nAnd that will do the same thing that you\nsee in that first email I sent out when it\n\n368\n00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.920\ntalked about spam protection there.\n\n369\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.320\nIt will bounce back to you and\nwhat that means when they bounce back,\n\n370\n00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.910\nit means you send it to the server and\nthe says, uh-uh, no food for you.\n\n371\n00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.180\nAnd it comes back to you and\nit says, undeliverable message.\n\n372\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.763\nSo make sure of the size limit.\n\n373\n00:20:13.763 --> 00:20:18.780\nThe other thing with these attachments,\ntoo, all right, it was in the earlier\n\n374\n00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.800\ndays of the email clients, it was very\neasy for somebody to send a file to you\n\n375\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.450\nthat when you clicked on it could open up\nand could cause damage to your computer.\n\n376\n00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.370\nSo they also sometimes\nrestrict the file types.\n\n377\n00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.170\nFor instance, if this was an executable,\nan application,\n\n378\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.910\nthat's typically a .exe and\nI want to send it to Ronnie,\n\n379\n00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.410\nI could tell you right now I\nwouldn't be able to send it.\n\n380\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.310\nWhy?\n\n381\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:45.150\nBecause it is an application that\nthe moment that Ronnie clicks on it,\n\n382\n00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.820\nit could potentially start executing\nsoftware on his computer that causes some\n\n383\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.910\nkind of undesired unauthorized effect.\n\n384\n00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.477\nWe typically could call it viruses.\n\n385\n00:20:54.477 --> 00:20:58.729\nSo you also have to watch out\nthat there could be a file\n\n386\n00:20:58.729 --> 00:21:01.831\ntype limitation as well, all right.\n\n387\n00:21:01.831 --> 00:21:06.284\nNow let me go ahead and we'll talk,\nreal briefly, about contacts too,\n\n388\n00:21:06.284 --> 00:21:07.900\non how you can set that up.\n\n389\n00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.460\nThat is something that\nyou want you to know,\n\n390\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.790\nthey want you to know\na little bit about contacts.\n\n391\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.910\nAnd how this happens is always different\nthrough all of the different platforms.\n\n392\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.310\nWe'll go ahead and\nstick into Gmail on this one and\n\n393\n00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.230\nlet me show you where that is.\n\n394\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:23.104\nNotice that over here in this case\nif I choose Gmail I have Contacts.\n\n395\n00:21:23.104 --> 00:21:27.725\nIf I select Contacts, it's gonna\ngive me the ability to see what is\n\n396\n00:21:27.725 --> 00:21:31.240\nknown as my contact book, my contact list.\n\n397\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.270\nIn this case I already have a contact,\nright?\n\n398\n00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:39.290\nAnd if I wanted to with the little pencil\nicon I could edit the information.\n\n399\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.070\nNotice that we can add\nall of this information,\n\n400\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.980\nI can add an email to it if I\nwant to as well, all right?\n\n401\n00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.220\nSo that's how you would\nmodify an existing contact.\n\n402\n00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.460\nNotice that I also have,\nmy heads kind of covering it up here but\n\n403\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.060\nthis little plus icon.\n\n404\n00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.480\nNotice that it says as I hover over it,\nit says new contact, right?\n\n405\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.579\nAnd if I click on that, it's telling me to\nenter the name, right, and I might enter\n\n406\n00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:06.405\nthe name, maybe I wanna add Ronnie as\na contact and I just add Ronnie, right?\n\n407\n00:22:06.405 --> 00:22:09.740\nI'm gonna create it very generically here,\nall right.\n\n408\n00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.380\nAnd I add the company, I say OK,\nI want the company name,\n\n409\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.910\nI'll do ITProTV, right,\nand I add an email.\n\n410\n00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:24.133\nAnd I'm gonna add ronnie@itpro.tv.\n\n411\n00:22:24.133 --> 00:22:28.430\nAll right, there's additional fields,\nyou can get very, very specific on this.\n\n412\n00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.790\nThat's up to you as to how much\ninformation you put in there.\n\n413\n00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.666\nThis should suffice on how you do it.\n\n414\n00:22:32.666 --> 00:22:35.020\nAnd then I'll choose Save.\n\n415\n00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.976\nAll right,\nnow what does that really do for me?\n\n416\n00:22:37.976 --> 00:22:39.730\nHow does that actually benefit me?\n\n417\n00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:44.530\nWell, let's go ahead and what we're gonna\ndo is I'm gonna close down Contacts and\n\n418\n00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.180\nI'm gonna do a Compose here.\n\n419\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.510\nRemember the to field\nthat I was talking about.\n\n420\n00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.283\nAll right,\n\n421\n00:22:49.283 --> 00:22:55.010\nthe to field here gives me the ability to\nsearch through my contacts that I have.\n\n422\n00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:59.030\nAnd in this case without having to type\nout or remember Ronnie's email address.\n\n423\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.760\nI would hope that I do.\n\n424\n00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.080\nI can choose Ronnie and\nI can choose Select.\n\n425\n00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.210\nAnd I want you to notice something.\n\n426\n00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.490\nNotice how his name appears here.\n\n427\n00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.750\nSo Contacts in general help you\nas it relates back to email.\n\n428\n00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.650\nThey help you, assist you in finding\nmultiple users, it can be a single user.\n\n429\n00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.680\nIt can be multiple users\nwithin some kind of listing.\n\n430\n00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.960\nImagine this way,\nyou need to call somebody what do you do?\n\n431\n00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.010\nIf you don't know the number and\nyou need to order pizza.\n\n432\n00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.810\nI open the phone book, right,\nand I search through it.\n\n433\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.907\nIn this case,\nwe'd probably just search online, but\n\n434\n00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:30.480\neither way I'm having to search for it.\n\n435\n00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.339\nIt's nice to have that information already\nstored in a location that you can just\n\n436\n00:23:34.339 --> 00:23:38.083\nquickly access and you can call on it when\nyou need it and you could also do things\n\n437\n00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.796\nlike searching through alphabetically,\nif you will, as well, all right.\n\n438\n00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:44.470\nSo Contacts is something\nthat you will need to know.\n\n439\n00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.700\nI would say that the last thing that\nI would talk about is just etiquette.\n\n440\n00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.792\nWe've already mentioned some of it.\n\n441\n00:23:50.792 --> 00:23:53.848\nBe clear and\nconcise in your emails, all right.\n\n442\n00:23:53.848 --> 00:23:58.151\nOne of the Advice is, Ronnie, I think\nyou've even given me this advice before,\n\n443\n00:23:58.151 --> 00:24:02.550\nis that if you're composing an email,\ncompose it in a word processor first.\n\n444\n00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:06.090\nMake sure it helps you with your\nspelling and stuff, your punctuation.\n\n445\n00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:10.220\nAnd then you can always copy\nit into your email client and\n\n446\n00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.760\nthen you can send it\nafter that fact as well.\n\n447\n00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.400\nCaps lock, right, watch your caps lock.\n\n448\n00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.240\nIf you're new to computing\nit's easy to do.\n\n449\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.270\nYou hit the caps lock and\nnow you've got all caps.\n\n450\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.850\nEtiquette says that all caps locks in\nany kind of message typically means that\n\n451\n00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.700\nyou're conveying shouting.\n\n452\n00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.640\nYou're conveying that\nyou're yelling at somebody.\n\n453\n00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.920\nAnd you certainly could, might be,\nbut I think you might not be.\n\n454\n00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.200\nSo definitely be careful with that.\n\n455\n00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.010\nAbbreviations, now I use this in\nthe context of text messaging, all right.\n\n456\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.690\nIf you're sending an email, there's\na difference between an SMS message,\n\n457\n00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.930\nwhere you might be extremely limited to\nhow many characters you can put in that\n\n458\n00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.840\nmessage if you need to convey something.\n\n459\n00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.880\nIn an email, a lot of times you're not\nreally restricted by characters so LOL,\n\n460\n00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:00.230\nOMG, all of these, and I wouldn't\neven know half of the abbreviations.\n\n461\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.730\nBut you really wanna limit those as much\nas possible cuz what it conveys is really\n\n462\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.190\nyou're a high schooler, right.\n\n463\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:10.015\nAnd you might be, that's not a bad thing,\nbut if you're more going for\n\n464\n00:25:10.015 --> 00:25:14.940\nbusiness-centric emails,\nit might be considered as rude.\n\n465\n00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.070\nReply all, okay.\n\n466\n00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:22.740\nIf you have a boss maybe that does\nall users, as they might call it,\n\n467\n00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.159\nwhere they send one email out, and\nit goes to everybody, all right.\n\n468\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.460\nYou don't have to reply all back to it,\nbecause what happens is that can start\n\n469\n00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.700\nthis e-mail thread that basically\nis a form of spamming, all right.\n\n470\n00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.280\nNow that also leads to one of the last\nthings I'll mention as well is, well,\n\n471\n00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.180\ntwo things.\n\n472\n00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.630\nAttachments, when you're receiving them,\nbe careful, all right.\n\n473\n00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.880\nMake sure you got some\nanti-virus software.\n\n474\n00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.530\nIf you receive an attachment\nfrom somebody you don't know,\n\n475\n00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.220\nI would delete it right away.\n\n476\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:56.100\nWhen sending attachments, be mindful of\nhow much information you have in them.\n\n477\n00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:01.400\nAgain they can start to be, accumulate\na lot of space in somebody's email client,\n\n478\n00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.290\nand that could be problematic.\n\n479\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:07.170\nForwarding, the other thing I would say\nis when you're forwarding information,\n\n480\n00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.100\nkeep in mind how much you're forwarding.\n\n481\n00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.850\nJust if you're just one of these that's\njust copy, paste, forward, copy, paste,\n\n482\n00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.020\nforward, it's also considered spamming.\n\n483\n00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.220\nAnd if you've ever had a spam folder\nthat's full of thousands of emails,\n\n484\n00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.570\nyou know what it's like to have to\ngo through and sort through that.\n\n485\n00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.810\nIt's even worse if it's coming\nfrom somebody that seems legit and\n\n486\n00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.040\nis not on a spam list and it makes it and\nclutters up somebody's inbox.\n\n487\n00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:32.490\nSo again, it can be a little\nbit problematic as well, but\n\n488\n00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.730\njust some of the etiquette things\nthat I think you should know as well\n\n489\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.910\nwhen you're sending and receiving emails.\n\n490\n00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.610\n&gt;&gt; Wes,\nI think when it comes down to emails,\n\n491\n00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:43.040\nthere's a couple of contexts that we need\nto be aware of, especially when we start\n\n492\n00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:48.130\nworking, as well as being a connected\nperson that's online too.\n\n493\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:52.500\nWhen you're inside of working with\nbusiness email, the goal there is\n\n494\n00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.380\nefficiency and language, as well as in\nthe use of what we have available to us.\n\n495\n00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.100\nAnd the reason why is that there's\nonly a limited amount of space, and\n\n496\n00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:04.330\nyou're not the only one that has\nto worry about the speed and\n\n497\n00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.530\neverything else dealing\nwith that email server.\n\n498\n00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:10.560\nSo attachments,\nthey should only be sent when required.\n\n499\n00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.219\nDo not add in additional to the\nattachments just because you think that\n\n500\n00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:16.180\nit's a cute thing to add in.\n\n501\n00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.820\nWhen you're being cute\nthat's perfectly fine,\n\n502\n00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.140\nnot normally something that we\ndo in the business environment.\n\n503\n00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.930\nIn the home environment,\nright, out in social life and\n\n504\n00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.120\neverything else,\ndo whatever you want to in your email.\n\n505\n00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.960\nJust kind of be aware that there\nare certain etiquette rules\n\n506\n00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.820\nthat end up being followed.\n\n507\n00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.760\nBut in business it's probably\nmuch more concerning\n\n508\n00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.800\nthat you are a little bit more\nefficient at what you have there.\n\n509\n00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.020\nA lot of times in those\nparticular situations,\n\n510\n00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.890\nattachments, they're limited\nto a certain size so\n\n511\n00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.490\nthat you do not overwhelm\nthe actual server that's out there.\n\n512\n00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.630\nMost of the time if you do\nneed to share files regularly,\n\n513\n00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.840\nask your technical support what's\nthe best way to share this file.\n\n514\n00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.580\nDo not assume adding it\nas an email attachment\n\n515\n00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.880\nis the way to go automatically today.\n\n516\n00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.870\nIt used to be at one time, but\ntoday that's not gonna be the truth here.\n\n517\n00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:07.800\nThe other thing that we also want\nto point out here of course then.\n\n518\n00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.610\nIs that when you start to work with it\nyou'll see that email is going to be one\n\n519\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.500\nof those primary lines of\ncommunication for you.\n\n520\n00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.070\nSo checking your grammar,\nmaking sure that you actually do spell and\n\n521\n00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:24.150\nthat you punctuate, is gonna be key and\nof course even short messages instead.\n\n522\n00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.750\nYou can write an entire book in an email,\nI've seen people do it.\n\n523\n00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.670\nMost of the time after about 10 or\n15 lines, I don't want to read it anymore.\n\n524\n00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.950\nAnd that's kind of one of those things\nwhere the etiquette really helps you out\n\n525\n00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.140\nhere in the end.\n\n526\n00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.470\nAll right, Wes, any final words\nbefore we close out this episode?\n\n527\n00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.240\n&gt;&gt; No, I think, that's really good.\n\n528\n00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.610\nJust again,\nkeep in mind any confidentiality,\n\n529\n00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:50.540\nkind of, maybe your company's got a policy\nfor confidentiality and stuff like that.\n\n530\n00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.470\nBut other than that no,\nI think we covered it pretty good.\n\n531\n00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, well this is a great\nplace then for us to end this episode.\n\n532\n00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.860\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n533\n00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n534\n00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.710\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned

media.\n\n5\n00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.186\nSome of the different aspects of where\npeople are actually connecting and some\n\n6\n00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:33.781\nways we can actually use well our

00:00:38.720\nWes, welcome back.\n\n9\n00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.880\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.240\nThat's right, I'm late all the time so\n\n11\n00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.390\nI don't know if you should believe\nthat one too much, that's for sure.\n\n12\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.820\nBut that's exactly right.\n\n13\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.210\nWe're gonna look at our calendars here.\n\n14\n00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.770\nWe're gonna talk a little bit about it.\n\n15\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.780\nBefore on a prior episode, we talked\na little bit about emails and contacts.\n\n16\n00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.510\nWell you can't talk about email and\ncontacts in one episode and\n\n17\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.980\nthen leave out the calendar because,\nthat's right, it is important.\n\n18\n00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.530\nFor time management purposes it's great,\nand we do have,\n\n19\n00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.260\nwhen it comes to calendars, we have\nthem in a couple of different aspects.\n\n20\n00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.140\nAs with everything that\nwe've been talking about,\n\n21\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.420\nas it relates to email and\ncontacts, you also have personal\n\n22\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.760\ncalendars as well as you also have\ncalendars inside of the business world.\n\n23\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.340\nIn fact here at ITProTV, we have\na calendar that we all see when we want\n\n24\n00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.670\nto look at the different episodes that are\ncoming up, and it's shared out with us.\n\n25\n00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.640\nDifferent meetings that are available, so\n\n26\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.350\nit is really good to really know about\nthe calendar applications in general.\n\n27\n00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.730\nKeep in mind that just like email clients,\n\n28\n00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.110\nthese can come in many different flavors,\nif you will.\n\n29\n00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.190\nSo we're gonna be looking primarily\nat a couple of the different calendar\n\n30\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.770\nplatforms, if you will.\n\n31\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.100\nIt's gonna be Gmail and\nit's gonna be the Outlook.\n\n32\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.290\nKeep in mind that there are other\nplatforms out there that can also\n\n33\n00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.880\nuse the calendaring application as well.\n\n34\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.231\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, so\nlet's say that I don't come from the idea\n\n35\n00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:59.172\nof using these types of applications\nto help me track and manage events.\n\n36\n00:01:59.172 --> 00:02:04.112\nThat what I have is something, I went\nto the drug store or to the pharmacy,\n\n37\n00:02:04.112 --> 00:02:08.909\nand picked up one of those books that\nactually have the months on there.\n\n38\n00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.170\nWhy shouldn't I stick to that\nwhen we have things like this?\n\n39\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.000\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a great question, you know,\nand the analogy I like to use is for\n\n40\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.790\ninstance, since you might be studying\nright now, maybe you're preparing for\n\n41\n00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.610\nthe certification is the concept of\nelectronic flashcards versus, you know,\n\n42\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.240\nthose traditional home flashcards\nthat you were write down, right?\n\n43\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.867\nSo like the pocket organizer\nthat Ronnie's talking about,\n\n44\n00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:32.294\njust like traditional\nflashcards if you will, right?\n\n45\n00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:34.551\nYou have to write down\nall your appointments.\n\n46\n00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:38.409\nBut then what happens if I like I said, as\nmuch as I like to be time management and\n\n47\n00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.683\norganized, I forget my head if it\nwouldn't attached to the neck,\n\n48\n00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:44.211\nI decided to leave that organizer at home,\nright?\n\n49\n00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:47.154\nAnd that organizer has all of my\nimportant calendar information and\n\n50\n00:02:47.154 --> 00:02:50.110\nall of my appointments for\ntoday and the rest of the week.\n\n51\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.600\nI get to work.\n\n52\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.060\nI get to a place of business and somebody\nsays, what are you doing tomorrow?\n\n53\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.150\nI really, really need you to tell me if\nyou're available at such and such time.\n\n54\n00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.098\nWell the problem with the pocket\norganizer, the traditional organizers that\n\n55\n00:03:04.098 --> 00:03:06.988\nwe've had is that you have to\ntake them with you, right?\n\n56\n00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:11.552\nAnd they're not really too flexible unless\nyou write in pencil when it comes to\n\n57\n00:03:11.552 --> 00:03:15.025\nupdating, and maybe you have an event,\nand what happens?\n\n58\n00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:16.472\nThat event gets pushed back.\n\n59\n00:03:16.472 --> 00:03:21.098\nIt's no longer at this time, it's gonna be\na few hours later so now I got to go in\n\n60\n00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:26.540\nand I got a bunch of scribbles in there so\npocket organizers, they're great to have.\n\n61\n00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.804\nThis is even better to have because\nthe only thing you need is access to\n\n62\n00:03:29.804 --> 00:03:32.297\nan internet connection in\norder to be able to use it.\n\n63\n00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:36.820\nAnd another great thing is that you\ncan't really leave this one at home.\n\n64\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.900\nI mean, I guess you could but\n\n65\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.760\nreally what you're doing is you're\nleaving it in the cloud and\n\n66\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.320\nall you gotta do is have a computer that\nhas an internet access, a connection,\n\n67\n00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.180\nif you will, and you are ready to go.\n\n68\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.530\nSo let's go ahead, I'll tell you what,\nlet's quit talking about here and\n\n69\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.090\nwe'll just jump in to the calendar app.\n\n70\n00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.890\nI'm actually logged in to Gmail.\n\n71\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.200\nIf you've watched another\nepisode that we've done where we\n\n72\n00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.930\nlooked at the email clients,\nI'm using the same account, guys.\n\n73\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.490\nSo there is some consistency there.\n\n74\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.410\nAnd we're in Gmail and we're also in\nOutlook.com in the background, but\n\n75\n00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.430\nwe'll go ahead for now and I believe\nwe'll just stick to Gmail on this one.\n\n76\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.830\nNow when we go to Gmail and\nwe're going to set up a calendar,\n\n77\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.540\nwhat's It's first thing we have to do?\n\n78\n00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.270\nWell, as of right now Gmail\nhas this little box, right?\n\n79\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.500\nMaybe somebody of you guys\nmight used to the Android\n\n80\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.360\noperating system on maybe\nyour mobile phones.\n\n81\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.070\nYou've probably seen something\ncalled an applocker icon and\n\n82\n00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.560\nit takes you to all the applications\nwithin your cellphones.\n\n83\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.930\nWell here in Gmail, or Google if you will,\n\n84\n00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.120\nthey keep that icon the same and\nwhat you have is this little kinda like\n\n85\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.260\nan applications locker in the fact that it\ngives you access to all the various cloud\n\n86\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.290\nbased services that you\nshould need access to.\n\n87\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.430\nAnd you can see that there is,\n\n88\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.570\nmy head's kinda covering it up here,\nI know you can only see the 31 there, but\n\n89\n00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.280\nyou can notice that the calendar\napplication is right there.\n\n90\n00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.580\nAll right, and this is it, right?\n\n91\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.920\nIt looks like a pocket organizer, if you\nwill, and more of electronic format, and\n\n92\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.130\nI'm viewing it through any\ncompatible web browser, right?\n\n93\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.780\nI can see for instance across the top\nhere, I can see the days of the week, and\n\n94\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.700\nthe dates associated with them.\n\n95\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.330\nYou can see that we have some\ninformation here, in fact.\n\n96\n00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.190\nYou can see the different\nevents as these are called.\n\n97\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.700\nLet me see, you got a few, throughout\nthe day, and they're color coded.\n\n98\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.790\nAnd you might ask,\nwhat's the coloring about?\n\n99\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.170\nWell that's a good thing.\n\n100\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.010\nI can set these and\nset the colors to the way I want.\n\n101\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.850\nSo I can help to differentiate\none meeting over the other.\n\n102\n00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.060\nIt's really good to get a quick\nvisual if you have, in a same day,\n\n103\n00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.080\nmaybe you have different meanings, and you\nwanna be able to kinda just differentiate\n\n104\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.680\nwhich meanings are what, you can assign\nthings like colors to them as well.\n\n105\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.230\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n106\n00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.130\nLet's create an event.\n\n107\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.475\nAgain, as we use different platforms,\nkeep in mind that the modifications that\n\n108\n00:05:55.475 --> 00:06:00.977\nyou make could be slightly different from\none platform to the next, but for the most\n\n109\n00:06:00.977 --> 00:06:06.322\npart, like you've seen, if you go back and\nwatch our Email Client episode, for\n\n110\n00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:11.621\nthe most part, they should be relatively\nsimplistic and the same, all right?\n\n111\n00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.920\nSo today is Thursday, right?\n\n112\n00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.120\nLet's say as of today, today is Thursday,\n\n113\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.380\nyou might be watching\nit on a different day.\n\n114\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.890\nBut for us today is Thursday.\n\n115\n00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.530\nWell maybe tomorrow after lunch, right?\n\n116\n00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.990\nRonnie calls me and says, hey, we've got\na meeting that we've got to go over.\n\n117\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.550\nWe've got to go over some the next\nepisodes in the series that we want to\n\n118\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.290\nlook at, and we really kind of get\ntogether and have a meeting of the minds,\n\n119\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.730\nand get together to figure out how\nwe want to do the next episode.\n\n120\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.210\nWell all I have to in this case is,\nit's really nice because in this area,\n\n121\n00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.550\nall I have to is just\ndouble-click an area, right, and\n\n122\n00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.830\nit brings me up into\nthis event settings page.\n\n123\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.711\nI wanna go ahead and\njust discard this for a second and\n\n124\n00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:56.474\nshow you that there is more\nthan one way to do this.\n\n125\n00:06:56.474 --> 00:07:00.773\nIf I wanted to I can go up here and I can\ncreate, I know I kinda click through that\n\n126\n00:07:00.773 --> 00:07:04.234\nfairly fast there, but\nnotice that there's Create option.\n\n127\n00:07:04.234 --> 00:07:05.266\nI can do a Quick Add.\n\n128\n00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:09.330\nAnd again, these are something that are\nspecific to the Google Calendar platform.\n\n129\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.760\nPay attention to the minor variations\nthat might be in the platform that you\n\n130\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.400\nin your house, or\nmaybe your business you use, cuz again,\n\n131\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.120\nthere's always slight differences here.\n\n132\n00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.250\nBut we'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose Create.\n\n133\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.630\nEither way you can click on the date.\n\n134\n00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.190\nWhat I like, the reason I like\nto click on the date itself,\n\n135\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.440\nthe day and the time,\nis because this tells me, for\n\n136\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.600\ninstance, you can see that this\nis 12 PM to 1 PM, all right?\n\n137\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.820\nSo on this day,\nwe're having a lunch meeting and\n\n138\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.090\nI decide that while this gonna be\nbetween 1 PM and 2 PM that Ronnie and\n\n139\n00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.340\nI are gonna meet and figure out what\nwe're gonna do for the next episode.\n\n140\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.158\nWell when I click on that, the good thing\nabout doing it this way is that without\n\n141\n00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:54.392\nhaving to fill that information in,\nnotice here it says, you know,\n\n142\n00:07:54.392 --> 00:07:59.142\ntoday is the 25th, it says tomorrow's\ndate, and it says the actual time.\n\n143\n00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:00.650\nAnd it's already filled out for me.\n\n144\n00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.570\nIf I go ahead and just discard this and\nI do a create here.\n\n145\n00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.780\nNotice that it is today's date, and\nthen I have to modify the time.\n\n146\n00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.170\nSo just a little convenience thing for\nyou, if you will.\n\n147\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.880\nAnd that's one of the reasons that if I am\ncreating an event, I'll discard this one.\n\n148\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.699\nNotice that it's the difference\nbetween saving and discard there.\n\n149\n00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:20.440\nNothing really big.\n\n150\n00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.420\nThis really shows me in more of\na graphical readout, if you will,\n\n151\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.490\na chart type layout, what hour I am\nclicking on by this column here.\n\n152\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.130\nSo it looks, if any of you guys have\never seen a spreadsheet before, if not,\n\n153\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:39.210\ncheck our key applications series out,\nbecause we talk more about that in there,\n\n154\n00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.890\nthat I basically had these nice rows and\ncolumns.\n\n155\n00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.570\nIt can help me to identify exactly\nthe time and the date, day, if you will,\n\n156\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.040\nthat I want to go ahead and\ncreate this meeting.\n\n157\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.730\nI double click on it, and\none more time, again,\n\n158\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.970\nsee that the time and\ndate is ready to go for me.\n\n159\n00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.460\nAll right, so, untitled event.\n\n160\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.350\nWe're gonna go ahead and title this event.\n\n161\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:07.220\nAll right,\nwe'll talk about IC3 Episode Discussion.\n\n162\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.946\nWatch my caps lock there.\n\n163\n00:09:14.516 --> 00:09:15.505\nThere we go.\n\n164\n00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:19.060\nAll right, now,\nis this gonna be an all day event?\n\n165\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:19.985\nMaybe it is, maybe it's not.\n\n166\n00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:24.133\nMaybe it starts at 1 o'clock and we know\nthat it's gonna run right till the end of\n\n167\n00:09:24.133 --> 00:09:26.148\nthe work day, so I might wanna do that.\n\n168\n00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:28.130\nI really don't have to.\n\n169\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.923\nMaybe we decided that,\nyou know what, Ronnie and\n\n170\n00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:35.244\nI have a good day that we're gonna meet\nevery day, every week, I should say,\n\n171\n00:09:35.244 --> 00:09:38.194\non this specific day, and\nwe'll go over episodes.\n\n172\n00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:40.590\nIn this case,\nwe're not gonna do that, right?\n\n173\n00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.260\nAll right, where's the location?\n\n174\n00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.250\nThis is something that's really good,\nbecause we can say, well,\n\n175\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.690\nwhere are we going to have this meeting,\nright?\n\n176\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.070\nIt could be,\nI could just type office, right?\n\n177\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.910\nAnd what's kinda cool here is that with\nGoogle, it actually does a location\n\n178\n00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.580\nsearch, based on what your location\ninformation is in the web browser.\n\n179\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.369\nAgain, that's a specific functionality of\nthis one, so I really don't wanna explain\n\n180\n00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:05.458\nthat too much, and then you open your\ncalendar and it doesn't do that.\n\n181\n00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:07.560\nI could say office, right.\n\n182\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.810\nWe happen to be here in our studio here,\nthis is what we call studio one.\n\n183\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.563\nSo, I might say, you know, since we're\ngonna be shooting in the studio,\n\n184\n00:10:16.563 --> 00:10:19.516\nwe'll go ahead and\nwe'll meet in studio one.\n\n185\n00:10:19.516 --> 00:10:20.539\nAll right.\n\n186\n00:10:20.539 --> 00:10:22.030\nYou can add video calls.\n\n187\n00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.276\nAgain, if you're gonna do this, again,\nthis is specific to this platform, so\n\n188\n00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:26.826\nI don't wanna get into that too much.\n\n189\n00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:32.490\nThat's not really a commonality\nnecessarily in every calendar application.\n\n190\n00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:37.720\nAnd I could say a description,\n\n191\n00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:43.753\nright, and I could say, Ronnie and\n\n192\n00:10:43.753 --> 00:10:49.600\nI discuss IC3 episodes, right?\n\n193\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.146\nSomething like that, all right?\n\n194\n00:10:51.146 --> 00:10:54.050\nWell, maybe I've got an outline, right?\n\n195\n00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.175\nI've got an outline that I already,\nI've already got some ideas.\n\n196\n00:10:58.175 --> 00:10:59.637\nSo I add an attachment, right?\n\n197\n00:10:59.637 --> 00:11:03.081\nAnd just like what we were talking about\nin our email client episode where we\n\n198\n00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:06.524\ntalked about sending an attachment\nvia email, when I send an invitation,\n\n199\n00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:08.238\nit's gonna have this information.\n\n200\n00:11:08.238 --> 00:11:09.440\nAnd just likewise, too.\n\n201\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.910\nIf Ronnie happened to be making\nthis calendar event, he says,\n\n202\n00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.810\nyou know what, I already got ideas and\nI would like you to\n\n203\n00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.960\nkinda read through them before we actually\nmeet, he can add an attachment, right?\n\n204\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.740\nAnd it just allows us through this event,\n\n205\n00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.230\nthat when he gets what's known as an event\nnotification, which it will send,\n\n206\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.460\nthat he's got information already\nthere available prior to the meeting.\n\n207\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.600\nYou can put those in there if you want,\nyou certainly don't have to.\n\n208\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.406\nNext thing that we have here\nis notifications, right.\n\n209\n00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:42.345\nYou can see that I could send\nthe notification through Gmail,\n\n210\n00:11:42.345 --> 00:11:45.670\nwe can send it via\na specific email if I want.\n\n211\n00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.970\nAll right, if I change email here,\nI can add a notification.\n\n212\n00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.550\nI'm not gonna add the notifications\nhere at this point.\n\n213\n00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.020\nBut you can choose how you want the party,\nor\n\n214\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.110\nI should say the attendees within\nthis event to be notified.\n\n215\n00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.410\nMaybe it is just something for\nmy personal benefit, right,\n\n216\n00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.280\nmaybe it's, my wife told me, hey,\non your way home such and such day,\n\n217\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.450\nyou need to stop by the store and\npick up this for the house.\n\n218\n00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.170\nWhatever it might be.\n\n219\n00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.532\nSo it could be just me and a personal\nreference more than it could be maybe\n\n220\n00:12:14.532 --> 00:12:18.133\nsending Ronnie an email, cuz you gotta\nbe careful with the notifications.\n\n221\n00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:21.920\nIf I say, send the notifications out,\nnotice it says every 30 minutes.\n\n222\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.722\nI don't wanna put this down\nto five minutes, right?\n\n223\n00:12:23.722 --> 00:12:26.940\nThat's just gonna keep hitting his phone\nand it becomes more of an annoyance.\n\n224\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.930\nSo keep in mind that there is a slight\nunspoken etiquette to this, you know.\n\n225\n00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.400\n30 minutes should be good enough.\n\n226\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.230\nIf you trim it down\neven more in that time,\n\n227\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.960\nit's gonna basically be\nspamming the end party.\n\n228\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.857\nAnd if you've got 400 people on this list,\n\n229\n00:12:41.857 --> 00:12:46.034\nyou're talking about a lot of\nnotifications that are coming out.\n\n230\n00:12:46.034 --> 00:12:49.884\nAnd again, just some more of\nthe characteristics and attributes, right.\n\n231\n00:12:49.884 --> 00:12:52.640\nI can say, show me as available.\n\n232\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.510\nMaybe I say that, we want maybe Nate,\nour producer out there,\n\n233\n00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.660\nwe want him to be in on\nthe meeting as well.\n\n234\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.646\nMaybe he's got some ideas for some of\nthe hardware we would need to show, right.\n\n235\n00:13:03.646 --> 00:13:05.290\nSo I can also do that.\n\n236\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.141\nI can say, show me as available, so\nsomebody knows that when this event goes\n\n237\n00:13:09.141 --> 00:13:13.065\nout, it's not a closed door event,\npeople can come in and go as they need to.\n\n238\n00:13:13.065 --> 00:13:14.200\nAll right.\n\n239\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.430\nVisibility, now,\nwe gotta be careful with this one.\n\n240\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.830\nVisibility, public or private?\n\n241\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.520\nPrivate means exactly what it sounds like,\nmyself, and\n\n242\n00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.880\nthen whoever I send it to, right?\n\n243\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:29.680\nIf I make this public in a cloud-based\nsolution here, you've got to be careful.\n\n244\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.136\nYou really got to know the privacy laws.\n\n245\n00:13:31.136 --> 00:13:34.090\nAnd I'm not even going to\nfake that I know them.\n\n246\n00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.070\nA long list of privacy information.\n\n247\n00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.889\nYou could potentially make this available\nto people that maybe you don't want to\n\n248\n00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:40.598\nmake it available.\n\n249\n00:13:40.598 --> 00:13:43.730\nIf this happens to be some kinda\ninside secret with the company,\n\n250\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.616\nwe might not wanna put this out there in\nthe public domain, cuz as we were talking\n\n251\n00:13:47.616 --> 00:13:51.386\nabout in other episodes, with public\ndomain, anything that's out there in\n\n252\n00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:55.231\nthe public domain can potentially be\nused without your notification or will.\n\n253\n00:13:55.231 --> 00:13:58.020\nAll right, now, guests.\n\n254\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.120\nI could add a guest email address,\nright, if I wanted to.\n\n255\n00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.988\nAnd I'm not gonna do this.\n\n256\n00:14:01.988 --> 00:14:04.440\nI could put Ronnie's email,\nand I could say, well,\n\n257\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.250\nI want Ronnie to be able to modify this.\n\n258\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.460\nWhy would I want Ronnie,\nif this is an event that we're gonna meet,\n\n259\n00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.500\nwhy would I want Ronnie to\nbe able to modify this?\n\n260\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.613\nWell, what if I send the notification, and\nRonnie says, well, at 1:30 to 2 o'clock,\n\n261\n00:14:15.613 --> 00:14:17.871\nI'm kinda busy,\ncan we adjust this by a half hour?\n\n262\n00:14:17.871 --> 00:14:21.050\nWell, sure enough, Ronnie, go ahead,\nadjust it by a half hour, I'm available.\n\n263\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:25.111\nAnd now we know through two way\nnotification that it has been modified\n\n264\n00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:25.956\na little bit.\n\n265\n00:14:25.956 --> 00:14:26.860\nOr maybe I don't.\n\n266\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.350\nMaybe it's set in stone,\nproverbial, set in stone here, and\n\n267\n00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.060\nwe have to meet their,\nmaybe I don't want them to invite.\n\n268\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.630\nMaybe Ronnie says, you know what?\n\n269\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.360\nI got somebody else that I think would\nbe excellent to sit in on this meeting,\n\n270\n00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.450\nbecause they've got some\nreally good advice too.\n\n271\n00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.640\nWell, now they can invite others.\n\n272\n00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.760\nAnd so again,\njust more of the things that you can do.\n\n273\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.406\nBut as an overview,\nI didn't mention one thing here.\n\n274\n00:14:49.406 --> 00:14:52.406\nMake sure if you're in multiple\ngeographical locations,\n\n275\n00:14:52.406 --> 00:14:54.387\nyou set your time zone appropriately.\n\n276\n00:14:54.387 --> 00:14:56.308\nThat is another thing that\nyou have to keep in mind.\n\n277\n00:14:56.308 --> 00:14:58.966\nAnd then once this is done,\nexcuse me, better English there,\n\n278\n00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:00.850\n[LAUGH] we'll go ahead and save it.\n\n279\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:06.660\nAnd you can see here,\nnotice that now I have this episode,\n\n280\n00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.370\nor in this case, this event has been set\nand I can see some information on it.\n\n281\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.120\nI can see the location, right.\n\n282\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.118\nAnd if I decide to, I can pull down and\nI can get a little more information on it.\n\n283\n00:15:15.118 --> 00:15:18.335\nNow, I didn't put too much\nof a description here, so.\n\n284\n00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:22.930\nAnd notice what I'm doing here,\nnotice, the time is changing, right.\n\n285\n00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:27.756\nNotice that now it's 3:30, now it's 3, and\n\n286\n00:15:27.756 --> 00:15:33.380\nthen finally, again,\nI can create all kinds of stuff if I.\n\n287\n00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.155\nGo ahead and close that down there.\n\n288\n00:15:35.155 --> 00:15:35.675\nThere we go.\n\n289\n00:15:35.675 --> 00:15:37.845\nSo you can modify it and move it around.\n\n290\n00:15:37.845 --> 00:15:39.065\nYou can adjust the time as so.\n\n291\n00:15:39.065 --> 00:15:40.225\nSo not really too,\n\n292\n00:15:40.225 --> 00:15:43.885\npretty straightforward process when\nit comes to creating an event.\n\n293\n00:15:43.885 --> 00:15:45.275\nKeep in mind who you send it to.\n\n294\n00:15:45.275 --> 00:15:49.225\nKeep in mind how often and frequently you\nsend it, because in sending it too many\n\n295\n00:15:49.225 --> 00:15:52.095\ntimes, you might have people that say,\nyou know what, that's so annoying.\n\n296\n00:15:52.095 --> 00:15:52.841\nI'm not gonna show up at all.\n\n297\n00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:55.670\nBut when it comes to the events,\nnot too hard to create.\n\n298\n00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.677\nAnd certainly,\nif you do color coordination and stuff,\n\n299\n00:15:58.677 --> 00:16:01.872\nit might make it a little easier\non your viewing abilities and\n\n300\n00:16:01.872 --> 00:16:04.016\nalso being able to keep it coordinated.\n\n301\n00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:07.744\nThe idea of being able to use\na calendaring system like this not only\n\n302\n00:16:07.744 --> 00:16:12.137\nhelps you keep tack of your time, but\nin an organization that uses the same type\n\n303\n00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:16.620\nof calendar system it allows everybody\nto see what's on everybody elses time.\n\n304\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.268\nAnd that's kind of a key,\nthat way when meetings are scheduled they\n\n305\n00:16:20.268 --> 00:16:22.956\nhave something that\nactually coordinates that.\n\n306\n00:16:22.956 --> 00:16:26.895\nAnd you don't spend all day nor\ndoes the other person spend all\n\n307\n00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:31.000\nday responding to phone tag is\nreally kind of the key here.\n\n308\n00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.224\nSo when you do have have a calendar,\nespecially an electronic calendar,\n\n309\n00:16:34.224 --> 00:16:37.188\nyou can create an event that is\nreally just a reminder for yourself.\n\n310\n00:16:37.188 --> 00:16:41.248\nTo tell you, hey I've got an appointment\nat this particular day that way you don't\n\n311\n00:16:41.248 --> 00:16:42.820\nschedule a meeting.\n\n312\n00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.406\nYou can also then, of course, create an\nevent in which you invite other people to.\n\n313\n00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:51.584\nAnd then they can check their own calendar\nsystem to see if they're actually able to\n\n314\n00:16:51.584 --> 00:16:55.237\nget in there or whether or not they\nmight have declined that invitation.\n\n315\n00:16:55.237 --> 00:16:56.541\nAnd that way you know whether or\n\n316\n00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.520\nnot they're going to be there\nif they respond to it as well.\n\n317\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.550\nSo this again is acting more\nlike your personal assistant and\n\n318\n00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.570\nelectronically without you actually\nneeding a personal assistant to\n\n319\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.830\nmake those types of meetings for you.\n\n320\n00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.630\nSo these are very important types of\nsystems that are actually available.\n\n321\n00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.350\nNow the grand scheme behind the idea,\nthat I really appreciate, and\n\n322\n00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.260\nwhen I started using it is simple.\n\n323\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.410\nI have a personal calendar, but\nI also have a work calendar.\n\n324\n00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.990\nBut I know that I can actually\ntake my smartphone and\n\n325\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.430\nI can connect them both to one calendar.\n\n326\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.782\nAnd so that allows me to then not\nmanage two different calendars but\n\n327\n00:17:35.782 --> 00:17:40.200\nI essentially manage one\ncalendaring system from my phone.\n\n328\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.530\nAnd then I could actually create an event\nand say which calendar does this go to.\n\n329\n00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.930\nAnd that way I'm not having to flip\nbetween three different calendars.\n\n330\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.450\nI can actually go ahead and\nuse that one management system.\n\n331\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:57.410\nAnd that has really helped to save\nme incredible amounts of time\n\n332\n00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.320\nbecause as long as I\nhave that device with me,\n\n333\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.240\nwhich is usually my smartphone,\nI know that I'm completely going to\n\n334\n00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.780\nbe able to keep track of a lot of\ndifferent things all from that one device.\n\n335\n00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.357\nIt has really been helpful.\n\n336\n00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:12.272\n&gt;&gt; You know, Ronnie,\nI'm glad you mentioned that.\n\n337\n00:18:12.272 --> 00:18:14.060\nThat's a great piece of advice, there.\n\n338\n00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.720\nLet me show you how to do\nexactly what he's talking about.\n\n339\n00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.061\nIf we check it out here,\nnotice that on the left hand side here,\n\n340\n00:18:20.061 --> 00:18:22.345\nI do have my calendars, I have reminders.\n\n341\n00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:25.211\nWell what if I decide that like Ronnie\nsays, this is a business calendar,\n\n342\n00:18:25.211 --> 00:18:26.830\nI want to make a personal calendar.\n\n343\n00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.810\nWell the great thing is you\njust hit the drop down list and\n\n344\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.280\nyou can see an option here\ncreate a new calendar right?\n\n345\n00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:38.883\nAnd then I have the option to say hey,\npersonal calendar right?\n\n346\n00:18:38.883 --> 00:18:42.148\nAnd we can set some additional\ninformation again time zone for me,\n\n347\n00:18:42.148 --> 00:18:45.620\nthat's continuous because\nhere we're on Eastern time.\n\n348\n00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.140\nWhat is that, GMT- 4, I believe.\n\n349\n00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.380\nAnd from here,\nwe'll talk about sharing in a second.\n\n350\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.110\nI don't wanna get ahead of myself here.\n\n351\n00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:59.540\nBut I can turn around and I can choose\ndown at the bottom, Create Calendar.\n\n352\n00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.910\nAnd when we create the calendar now,\n\n353\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.130\nnotice that I do have\na couple of different ones.\n\n354\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:10.450\nHere if I chose the first one all right,\nit gives me that business calendar and\n\n355\n00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:15.270\nif I chose personal calendar,\ngo ahead and chose that the second and\n\n356\n00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.470\ndrop down will if it'll\nswitch over to that.\n\n357\n00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.870\nIt might still be open.\n\n358\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.390\nMight still be,\nit looks like saving changes there.\n\n359\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.440\nSo it's creating the calendar and\nthe background.\n\n360\n00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.480\nBut the great things is I do get\nthe ability to switch back and\n\n361\n00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.390\nbetween the different\ncalendars themselves.\n\n362\n00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.110\nNow I did mention something and\n\n363\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.880\nI think Ronnie mentioned about\njust the idea of sharing an event.\n\n364\n00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.430\nWhat if we want to share\nthe whole calendar?\n\n365\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.300\nThis might be very good\nin a family situation.\n\n366\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.810\nMaybe you have kids that\nare in high school.\n\n367\n00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:49.863\nMaybe your wife or your husband or\nyour significant other decides that, hey,\n\n368\n00:19:49.863 --> 00:19:54.703\nwe want to see what's going on in each\nothers day to day personal calendar.\n\n369\n00:19:54.703 --> 00:19:58.706\nWell this is where you get the ability\nto actually take in this case,\n\n370\n00:19:58.706 --> 00:20:02.300\nMyCalendar right here and\nI can share it with somebody else.\n\n371\n00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.170\nLet's go ahead and show how that's done.\n\n372\n00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.170\nIt's fairly easy process here.\n\n373\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:06.990\nSo I'll go ahead.\n\n374\n00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.536\nAnd you know what?\n\n375\n00:20:09.536 --> 00:20:11.690\nI got to Settings here.\n\n376\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.460\nGo ahead and\nmake sure that I'm zoomed out there.\n\n377\n00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:20.690\nWe're gonna go to Settings, little gear\nicon there, we'll choose Settings here.\n\n378\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.050\nAnd then on the General\ntab here you're gonna see,\n\n379\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.690\nthis is just basic general information\nthat I can modify on this calendar,\n\n380\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.790\nthe time format,\ndate format and everything.\n\n381\n00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.530\nMight as well mention some of these\nhonorable mentions in here and\n\n382\n00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.400\nI could even say,\nwell when does the week start, right?\n\n383\n00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.650\nThat's good because the difference between\na personal calendar the week starts on\n\n384\n00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.940\nSunday, but if your business calendar\ntechnically starts on Monday and\n\n385\n00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.940\nends on Friday, you might wanna send\na start date a little bit different.\n\n386\n00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.679\nBut for the purposes of sharing,\n\n387\n00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:57.163\nwe're gonna go in this case up\nto Calendars All right, and\n\n388\n00:20:57.163 --> 00:21:04.050\nI have the ability to share this calendar,\nso we'll go ahead and click that link.\n\n389\n00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.700\nAnd what it basically tells\nme is that I need an address,\n\n390\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.460\nI need an email address in\norder to share this calendar.\n\n391\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.770\nSo if I decide, I'll go ahead and\nI'll put a name in here.\n\n392\n00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.940\nAnd then I edit, what level of access\ndo they have to this calendar?\n\n393\n00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.260\nAnd again there, that's important.\n\n394\n00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.331\nLike I said, if I send an event\nto Ronnie that was just a single\n\n395\n00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:24.270\nevent that I might want him to modify.\n\n396\n00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:29.440\nBut maybe this is a calendar for\nthis entire series that you're watching.\n\n397\n00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.390\nAnd with Ronnie being here with me I need\nhim to be able to see the whole entire\n\n398\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.600\ncalendar and want him to add events,\ntake events away.\n\n399\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.420\nWell I might want him to make\nchanges to the events there.\n\n400\n00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.890\nIf I do see events, that's kinda what we\nwould call, kind of like a read only,\n\n401\n00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.260\nyou might hear that term, read only.\n\n402\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.070\nThat means you can see the events but\nthere aren't any modifications that\n\n403\n00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.610\ncan be done by the person\nthat you're sharing with.\n\n404\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:54.349\nSo we'll just leave the defaults here and\nwe'll go ahead and save this.\n\n405\n00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.090\nIt says the following people do\nnot have Google Calendar accounts,\n\n406\n00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.150\nwould you like to invite\nthem to use Google?\n\n407\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.070\nWe're gonna say don't invite because I\ndon't really care about that right now and\n\n408\n00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:10.386\nI'm gonna switch over, we're playing\nboth ends of the tracks here.\n\n409\n00:22:10.386 --> 00:22:15.504\nI'm gonna switch over to the account\nI just shared this with and\n\n410\n00:22:15.504 --> 00:22:21.313\nlet me go ahead and reload this real\nquick I don't see it in my email yet.\n\n411\n00:22:21.313 --> 00:22:26.960\nAnd we might have to\nwait just a second here.\n\n412\n00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.820\nThere again, sometimes it takes a little\nbit to get the incoming message.\n\n413\n00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.816\nAnd I can see my little spinning\ncheerio there still working.\n\n414\n00:22:34.816 --> 00:22:36.843\nNow what ends up happening here,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n415\n00:22:36.843 --> 00:22:39.575\njust tell you what ends up happening here,\nis they receive an invite.\n\n416\n00:22:39.575 --> 00:22:43.324\nAnd they have the ability to either\naccept the invitation or again,\n\n417\n00:22:43.324 --> 00:22:46.720\nthey can just ignore it if they\nwant to and that's up to them.\n\n418\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.710\nAnd now what you end up having is,\n\n419\n00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.930\ndepending on the permissions that\nyou give, at least viewing rights.\n\n420\n00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.018\nBut you might even give them\nthe privilege to modify these calendars.\n\n421\n00:22:55.018 --> 00:22:57.903\nAnd again, that allows you to do\ncollaboration with a single calendar.\n\n422\n00:22:57.903 --> 00:23:01.030\nYou can create a new calendar, right?\n\n423\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.310\nSo you can also do creative things\ntoo like create a new calendar for\n\n424\n00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.370\nthe purposes of sharing it with\nsomebody to modify and edit.\n\n425\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.340\nWhere maybe another calendar that you\nhave, you don't want anybody to edit,\n\n426\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.770\nand you just share it out and it allows\nthem to view the events that are in there.\n\n427\n00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.670\nSo again,\npretty straight forward there Ronnie,\n\n428\n00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.482\nas long as you know the couple\nof little buttons here.\n\n429\n00:23:19.482 --> 00:23:23.890\nJust kinda peek and tweak it to\nwhatever suits your environment,\n\n430\n00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.650\nif I can say that right, and\nthen whatever platform you have.\n\n431\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.060\nKeep in mind there might\nbe moderate variations from\n\n432\n00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.250\nsome of the settings you see here.\n\n433\n00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.940\n&gt;&gt; All right well, now that we know\na little bit more about calendaring let's\n\n434\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.460\ntalk about this idea of social media and\nits impact and what do we need to know?\n\n435\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.354\n&gt;&gt; Man, I tell ya, social media's\nreally kinda changed the world.\n\n436\n00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:46.117\nUsed to be if you had a new product, maybe\nyou're in the company that's selling it,\n\n437\n00:23:46.117 --> 00:23:47.920\nyou used to had to go\ndoor to door to door.\n\n438\n00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.880\nYou had to pick up the phone.\n\n439\n00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.540\nYou had to make phone calls.\n\n440\n00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.560\nYou had to send out snail mail, right?\n\n441\n00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.820\nThose old letters we use to get in\nthis little box called the mailbox,\n\n442\n00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.670\nif anybody still uses those anymore.\n\n443\n00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.412\nBut today, it's not really that way.\n\n444\n00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:03.844\nWe have something known a social media and\nsocial media one of the biggest things,\n\n445\n00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:05.646\nthey call it social interaction, right?\n\n446\n00:24:05.646 --> 00:24:10.150\nThey're an electronical or\ndigital format as pretty much everything\n\n447\n00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.980\nwe're talking about here\nrevolves around digital media.\n\n448\n00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.110\nThat's essentially what this is.\n\n449\n00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.080\nIt's platforms that\nallow collaboration and\n\n450\n00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.916\nallows you to communicate\nwith other people.\n\n451\n00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:23.260\nIt allows you to do things like\nsubscribe to the views and\n\n452\n00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.590\nthe opinions of those people,\nshare resources.\n\n453\n00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.980\nLike for instance, media,\nyou could share resources.\n\n454\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.450\nLet's name some of the more common ones,\nright.\n\n455\n00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.690\nFacebook's probably one that everybody's\nheard of, at least at some point.\n\n456\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.390\nAnd Facebook,\nbeing one of the biggest social medias,\n\n457\n00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.440\nallows people to interact and\ncommunicate and\n\n458\n00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.280\nall different things that they,\nadditional things that they're adding.\n\n459\n00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.790\nBut for the most part,\nthat's what it's about.\n\n460\n00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:51.550\nIt's about the being able to interact\nwith other people in almost a real time\n\n461\n00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:57.130\nenvironment to where you can send basic\ntext messages, you can share videos.\n\n462\n00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.030\nYou can share, if you will, pictures.\n\n463\n00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.750\nA great way to keep in\ntouch with your family.\n\n464\n00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.350\nOther ones that we had out there that\nare more videocentric, YouTube right?\n\n465\n00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.190\nYou might say well how\nis YouTube social media?\n\n466\n00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.710\nWell YouTube technically is social media\nbecause I can record event of my family,\n\n467\n00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.570\nput it up on YouTube and then other\npeople can make comments about it.\n\n468\n00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:19.430\nAnd anytime you have that more of\na collaboration, you do have that.\n\n469\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.010\nTwitter is another one that's out there.\n\n470\n00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.790\nLinkedIn, more business-centric.\n\n471\n00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.322\nPinterest are some of them.\n\n472\n00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:29.920\nGoogle+, Google+ is another one that\nallows you to basically communicate,\n\n473\n00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.620\nnot quite as popular as Facebook,\nbut again, it is out there.\n\n474\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:39.950\nAnd you know, with LinkedIn,\nLinkedIn's more business-centric, right?\n\n475\n00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.520\nI know that all of these can be used for\npersonal and business, but\n\n476\n00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.630\nyou do have some that are more just\nreally specific to business environment,\n\n477\n00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:47.590\nLinkedIn being one of them.\n\n478\n00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.700\nThe other one that I\ncan think of is Yammer,\n\n479\n00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.560\nwhere it is kinda like a Facebook\ntype product, but it is internal and\n\n480\n00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:59.040\nit's typically shared as a way to\ncommunicate internally with a company.\n\n481\n00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.121\nSo these have their good, they have\ntheir goods and they have their bads.\n\n482\n00:26:03.121 --> 00:26:06.150\nAll right one of good things\nis that if you got a friend or\n\n483\n00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:09.470\na family member that you haven't seen in\na long time, you can reconnect with them,\n\n484\n00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.800\nyou can communicate with them, you can\nsend things like instant messaging.\n\n485\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.580\nSometimes they even build\nin the platform and\n\n486\n00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.920\nallow things like video\nconferencing as well.\n\n487\n00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.873\nAnd we'll go into what that's all about in\nanother episode, but do keep that in mind.\n\n488\n00:26:21.873 --> 00:26:26.391\nAnd it really is all based around what is\nknown as a digital identity, all right?\n\n489\n00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:30.366\nDigital identity is important to\nunderstand what it is because a digital\n\n490\n00:26:30.366 --> 00:26:32.844\nidentity could make or\nbreak your presence,\n\n491\n00:26:32.844 --> 00:26:36.310\nyour digital presence on\nthe internet if you will, all right?\n\n492\n00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.910\nSo what is it?\n\n493\n00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.060\nBasically electronic\ninformation about a person or\n\n494\n00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.518\nan organization that shapes\nother people's view.\n\n495\n00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:47.807\nBasically that's derived from your\nelectronic exchange, right, and\n\n496\n00:26:47.807 --> 00:26:51.601\nwhat I mean by that is how do you\ncommunicate openly with public,\n\n497\n00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:56.191\nwhether you're saying, well,\nI'm not talking publicly to other people.\n\n498\n00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:59.072\nWell, you're in a public environment so\nessentially that's what your doing.\n\n499\n00:26:59.072 --> 00:27:01.971\nSo keep in mind that your digital\nidentity has to be protected.\n\n500\n00:27:01.971 --> 00:27:04.535\nWe're not talking about things like,\nI mean,\n\n501\n00:27:04.535 --> 00:27:08.280\nI guess you could wrap this up into\nthings like privacy information.\n\n502\n00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.320\nBut what I'm talking about is\nmore of your presence, right?\n\n503\n00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:17.410\nAre you known as somebody that,\nI don't know, communicates a lot?\n\n504\n00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.540\nAre you somebody that's known as,\n\n505\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.180\nmaybe somebody you know that\ncomplains a lot, right?\n\n506\n00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.340\nThat all influences your social identity.\n\n507\n00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.730\nAre you one that's known to\ntake other people's work and\n\n508\n00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.330\npost it on social media, right?\n\n509\n00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.460\nWell you might be known as\nsomebody that what is it?\n\n510\n00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.740\nPlagiarizes other people's information.\n\n511\n00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.120\nAgain, so\nthose can have negative effects as well.\n\n512\n00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.064\nSo keep in mind that it is important that\nwhen you're dealing with social media,\n\n513\n00:27:43.064 --> 00:27:46.660\neven though it has some major benefits,\nit also has some drawbacks to it.\n\n514\n00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.810\nEspecially in the business environment\nwhen it comes to leaking sensitive\n\n515\n00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.420\ninformation, if you will.\n\n516\n00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.650\nA slanderous nature,\nyou gotta worry about slander.\n\n517\n00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:59.670\nPeople can be slanderized,\nvery slanderous out there, if you will.\n\n518\n00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.160\nAnd that leads me into pretty\nmuch one of the last topics I\n\n519\n00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.040\nwanna talk about that they\nreally want you to know.\n\n520\n00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.820\nIt's kinda sad that this is\none of those results, right?\n\n521\n00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.310\nWe say it has its goods and\nit has its bads.\n\n522\n00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:19.980\nWell this is definitely something that is\nthe result of something, something bad\n\n523\n00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:25.040\nif you will about social media in general,\nand that something called cyber bullying.\n\n524\n00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.400\nAnd it's definitely something that\nunfortunately does take place.\n\n525\n00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.410\nI wanna say it has no place\nin today's society, but\n\n526\n00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.070\nit does take place if you will,\nif that make sense.\n\n527\n00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:39.060\nIf basically a bullying that takes,\nbasically it takes place\n\n528\n00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.930\nthrough electronic media, if you will,\nelectronic communications.\n\n529\n00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.840\nSome of the examples that you can say I've\nalready kinda mentioned here being mean,\n\n530\n00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.450\nbeing slanderous.\n\n531\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.611\nYou know, Ronnie, you don't know how\nto bake a cake to save your life.\n\n532\n00:28:51.611 --> 00:28:54.948\nNow that's being very,\nvery light-hearted in that.\n\n533\n00:28:54.948 --> 00:28:58.644\nIt could be, we could give examples\nthat we probably really don't\n\n534\n00:28:58.644 --> 00:29:02.209\nwanna get give here, but\nit could be very explicit slanderous.\n\n535\n00:29:02.209 --> 00:29:04.909\nIt could be, you know,\nprofanity very profane, and\n\n536\n00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:09.049\nreally ruin somebody's reputation if you\nare in the high school level out there,\n\n537\n00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:11.712\nmiddle school,\nsome of you might be watching this.\n\n538\n00:29:11.712 --> 00:29:17.293\nYou know, bullies can happen to post\npictures that they happen to click with\n\n539\n00:29:17.293 --> 00:29:23.380\nsomebody with cell phones being present\nand us being so digitally-centric today.\n\n540\n00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.750\nPrivate information, that's another thing.\n\n541\n00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.470\nPeople taking, for instance,\ntext messages that you send and\n\n542\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.090\nposting it on social media when it\nwas only supposed to go to you, and\n\n543\n00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.870\nnow 500,000 people within five minutes\nhave access to that information.\n\n544\n00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:40.800\nIt's a little different from traditional\nbullying because this can take place 24/7.\n\n545\n00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.536\nGive you an example,\nschool closes down, right?\n\n546\n00:29:43.536 --> 00:29:47.212\nSo you have certain hours in school\nthat bullies that are physically\n\n547\n00:29:47.212 --> 00:29:51.804\npresent can actually bully people, this\nreally doesn't have a time sensitivity.\n\n548\n00:29:51.804 --> 00:29:54.707\n24/7 basically, 24 hours a day,\nseven days a week.\n\n549\n00:29:54.707 --> 00:29:58.651\nSo it is something that we have to watch\nand it is something that we have to try to\n\n550\n00:29:58.651 --> 00:30:01.461\ninsure it doesn't happen,\nspreading false rumors.\n\n551\n00:30:01.461 --> 00:30:03.259\nThe other one too, I might say is,\n\n552\n00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:05.989\nthat can happen is creating fake profiles,\nright?\n\n553\n00:30:05.989 --> 00:30:10.525\nI create a profile in Ronnie's name and\nI go out on that social media site and\n\n554\n00:30:10.525 --> 00:30:15.282\nI'm doing something that absolutely just,\nI don't know, ruthless right?\n\n555\n00:30:15.282 --> 00:30:17.400\nBut it all looks like\nit's coming from Ronnie.\n\n556\n00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.050\nSo again, cyber bullying can take\nmany different, many different forms.\n\n557\n00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:26.310\nJust be aware of it, and\nthere are ways that you can combat it\n\n558\n00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:30.310\nby doing a contact of the people that\nare providing the social media platform.\n\n559\n00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.484\nBecause a lot of times today they do\nhave some pretty strict rules on it.\n\n560\n00:30:33.484 --> 00:30:37.095\nAnd if they can identify it,\nthey will try to stop it.\n\n561\n00:30:37.095 --> 00:30:41.085\nBut if you don't make mention of anything,\nthey can't really stop something just\n\n562\n00:30:41.085 --> 00:30:44.410\nbecause the amount of people that\nthey have within their systems.\n\n563\n00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.920\nSo if you do see it, report it.\n\n564\n00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.770\n&gt;&gt; Just remembering in\nthe context of social media,\n\n565\n00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:52.900\nthere's two things to really be\nworrying about, in the business sense,\n\n566\n00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.830\nwhen you start connecting and\nusing computers online.\n\n567\n00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.230\nOne, you can reveal too much\ninformation through social media.\n\n568\n00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.720\nNow there's more information about\nwhat you do then you should,\n\n569\n00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.200\naccording to your company.\n\n570\n00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.409\nAnd the other one, of course,\n\n571\n00:31:04.409 --> 00:31:07.650\nis revealing too much personal\ninformation about yourself.\n\n572\n00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.460\nEither way, can lead to what some\nof the embarrassing exposures\n\n573\n00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.220\nthat Wes is actually talking about.\n\n574\n00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.180\nThe other about this also is the realm\nof cyber bullying that Wes is\n\n575\n00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.260\nmentioning here.\n\n576\n00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.950\nAnd even though we can talk on\na context of happening 24 hours a day,\n\n577\n00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.880\nthe clear idea here is simple.\n\n578\n00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.680\nIt's nothing that you want to be\na part of, so don't take part in it.\n\n579\n00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:34.550\nAnd secondly, of course, you can find\nyourself a victim of it as well, and\n\n580\n00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:38.080\nthat is when you actually\nknow a few things.\n\n581\n00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.410\nMore than likely you're a victim of it,\n\n582\n00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:42.490\nyou've revealed a bit more about\nyourself than you realized.\n\n583\n00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.710\nSo my advice to you is go into those\nsocial media settings that you have,\n\n584\n00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.110\nif you create an account,\n\n585\n00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:52.320\nmake sure you unshare anything\nyou would not want revealed.\n\n586\n00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.280\nDo not ever assume that anything\nthat you put online out there\n\n587\n00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.590\nis ever 100% private information.\n\n588\n00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.610\nI wouldn't text message anybody anything\n\n589\n00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:06.380\nthat I would not be afraid that would\nbe revealed in public at some point.\n\n590\n00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.780\nAnd you might be saying no,\nthat's too much, I tell everything.\n\n591\n00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.610\nWell, it lets you know that you have to\nalso watch your own behavior in this.\n\n592\n00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.500\nSocial media is one of\nthose two edged swords.\n\n593\n00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.810\nThey can be very popular and really\nspring you into internet popularity.\n\n594\n00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.100\nAt the same time, it can be your downfall.\n\n595\n00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.800\nSo be very careful here.\n\n596\n00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.860\nDo not find yourself doing things that\nyou wouldn't want done to you as well.\n\n597\n00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.400\nThe golden rule, but it really does help.\n\n598\n00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.810\nAll right Wes, any last words before\nwe sign off for this episode?\n\n599\n00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.030\n&gt;&gt; No, I think that's pretty much it.\n\n600\n00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.280\nJust one thing I might say, to add on\nto what Ronnie just said, remember your\n\n601\n00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.830\ndigital identity, the presence that\nyou give that people perceive of you\n\n602\n00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:47.190\nis always going to reflect on you later,\nnot just today, but tomorrow as well.\n\n603\n00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.120\nAnd again,\nthe more information you reveal through\n\n604\n00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.080\nthat digital identity could lead you into\nbecoming a victim of cyber bullying.\n\n605\n00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.630\nJust remember that if you identify it,\ntry to stop it.\n\n606\n00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.240\nMake sure that contact people, and\n\n607\n00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.170\ncertainly just like Ronnie said,\ndon't be a part of it.\n\n608\n00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.774\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWell that's a great place for\n\n609\n00:33:02.774 --> 00:33:07.187\nus to end this episode and signing off for\nITProTV, I've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n610\n00:33:07.187 --> 00:33:08.322\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n611\n00:33:08.322 -->

always.\n\n10\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.540\nIt's great to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.860\nThat's right we're continuing\nthrough our Living Online series and\n\n12\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.625\nwhat we're gonna be talking about today\nis a little bit about how we communicate\n\n13\n00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.135\nacross the Internet.\n\n14\n00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:43.375\nWhen we are online, we're gonna look\nat something known as streaming, and\n\n15\n00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:44.685\nwhat it means for you.\n\n16\n00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:48.835\nAs well as finally looking at some of the\ndifferent conferencing technologies that\n\n17\n00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:52.170\nwe have out there, or at least talk\nabout the components within them.\n\n18\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.620\nNow, when it comes to communication,\n\n19\n00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.540\nthere are many different technologies\nout there, probably some of\n\n20\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.430\nthe ones that you're most familiar\nwith are things like email, right.\n\n21\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.080\nWhen we say online, how am I gonna\ncommunicate with somebody else?\n\n22\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.610\nWell, typically I'm gonna\nsend them an email.\n\n23\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.822\nNow, we don't really have to be on the\nInternet per se for this next one, we do\n\n24\n00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:15.670\nneed a cellphone and that's things like\nSMS right, your simple message service.\n\n25\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.105\nYour text messages right but\nlargely speaking when we talk about\n\n26\n00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:23.255\nonline communications we're usually\ntalking about things like email.\n\n27\n00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:27.795\nBut there are a few more things and there\nare things that over the past five or\n\n28\n00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:30.235\nsix years have become really,\nreally prevalent.\n\n29\n00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:33.315\nSo let's kinda talk about some of\nthose things that we have available\n\n30\n00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:34.555\nin communications.\n\n31\n00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:36.505\nOne of the first ones here we'll go ahead,\nand\n\n32\n00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:40.090\nyou can see there's a slew of them,\nwe'll talk about these each individually.\n\n33\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.840\nAnd we have talked about another series\nabout things like email clients.\n\n34\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.390\nBut remember email one of\nthe major communications,\n\n35\n00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.810\nin fact it's really the way you can\nkeep up to date with what's going on in\n\n36\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.350\nsending emails in between your company\nas well as being able to communicate not\n\n37\n00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.730\nnecessarily does it have to be\na business environment either.\n\n38\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.250\nKeep in mind it can also be your\npersonal endeavors as well.\n\n39\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.980\nOne of the things you might consider\ndoing is having two accounts.\n\n40\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.830\nI know I have two accounts and\nI'm sure Dan here has two accounts, right.\n\n41\n00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.030\nWe have one for our personal,\nwhatever our personal endeavors might be.\n\n42\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.940\nAnd then we have one that's managed and\nmaintained through our company.\n\n43\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.960\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n44\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.600\nSome of the providers that we\nhave out there for emails,\n\n45\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.400\nI've mentioned a few of them here.\n\n46\n00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.430\nThere are some other\nones though like Outlook.\n\n47\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.390\nWe use Outlook here,\npart of the Office 365 series or\n\n48\n00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.720\nsuite if you will here at ITProTV.\n\n49\n00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.180\n&gt;&gt; Wes is Outlook.com\na part of Office 365?\n\n50\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.360\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting\nhow that works, yes it is.\n\n51\n00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.780\nAnd in fact the platforms I'm\ngoing to venture and say,\n\n52\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.850\ndon't quote me on this,\nthat they're the same platforms.\n\n53\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.990\nOne is just a wrap up, if you will,\nthat's just basically personal.\n\n54\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.120\nAnd they also have, for instance,\na subscription based, so\n\n55\n00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.220\nthings like Office 365.\n\n56\n00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.330\nSo a lot of times when you're\ntalking about Office 365,\n\n57\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.390\nyou're talking pay per play, right?\n\n58\n00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.970\nPay per view if you will.\n\n59\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.780\nPay to use, it's the software as a service\nthat we mentioned in other episodes but\n\n60\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.550\nit's primarily focused in\nthe business environment.\n\n61\n00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.170\nAnd one of the great things is people\nhave been aware of things like Hotmail\n\n62\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.810\nthat changed into Outlook.com right?\n\n63\n00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.100\nAnd the Outlook.com even though it's all\nthe same interface really is more of\n\n64\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.420\nthe personal side If you will,\nthe non-business environments.\n\n65\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.880\nWe also have things like Gmail.\n\n66\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.590\nGmail's one that I also use.\n\n67\n00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.620\nI use this one inside my personal email\nbecause I like the interface, if you will.\n\n68\n00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.080\nAnd one of the things I really like\nis their search functionality inside\n\n69\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.180\nof Gmail.\n\n70\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.500\nIt's got an excellent search functionality\nand \\who would have thought that\n\n71\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.260\nGoogle being one of the biggest search\nproviders in the world would have\n\n72\n00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.630\na good search functionality\ninside of their own email client?\n\n73\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.770\nThere's other ones out there that\nhave been there for a while too.\n\n74\n00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.120\nYahoo, Y Mail as it's called today.\n\n75\n00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.380\nThere's another one out there that\nI didn't put up here in the screen.\n\n76\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.730\nI couldn't find an icon for it.\n\n77\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.770\nSo I'll just have to mention this,\nit's an honorable mention because\n\n78\n00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.105\nthese are some of the big ones,\nbut the other one's Thunderbird.\n\n79\n00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:07.170\nThunderbird's out there as well and\nyou may have seen that,\n\n80\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.950\nyou may not have seen that as well.\n\n81\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.640\nKeep in mind that when it comes to email\ncommunications, we have two different\n\n82\n00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.720\ntypes of models if you will, and one is\ntypically in the business environment and\n\n83\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.140\nthat's where we're managing\nemail servers on our premise.\n\n84\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.270\nAnd you typically have some kind of IT\nstaff that helps to manage and maintain\n\n85\n00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.920\nthose communications, and if something\nfails, well unfortunately we gotta call up\n\n86\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.700\nDan and we gotta say Dan, Exchange server\nis down man, can you take a look at it?\n\n87\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.631\n&gt;&gt; And I'll be like, who is this again?\n\n88\n00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.415\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n89\n00:04:37.415 --> 00:04:41.655\nAnd what we're gonna, the other model\ntoo is something that's a little more\n\n90\n00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:43.795\ncommon for us in the personal environment.\n\n91\n00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:45.765\nAnd I say personal environment,\n\n92\n00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:47.720\nhome environment's probably\na better way to put that.\n\n93\n00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.190\nBut it is becoming more and\nmore prevalent.\n\n94\n00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.260\nProbably gonna be the way of the future.\n\n95\n00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.880\nIt is the software as a service,\nright, where everything is\n\n96\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.740\nbasically you're utilizing the resources\nof the whoever the provider is.\n\n97\n00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.990\nThat company like, for instance, Microsoft\nis Outlook.com, Google is Gmail and\n\n98\n00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.410\nYahoo is Ymail.\n\n99\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.440\nWell, and what you're doing is they're\nallowing you to use their service free.\n\n100\n00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.520\nKeep in mind free sometimes\ndoesn't truly mean free.\n\n101\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.460\nIf you got privacy concerns,\n\n102\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.450\nthat might be one of the things you should\nconsider when it comes down to using\n\n103\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.510\none of these software as\na service cloud based solutions.\n\n104\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.010\nBecause I have heard rumors that\nwhen you utilize those type\n\n105\n00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.680\nof systems that any of the information\nthat is being passed back and\n\n106\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.640\nforth technically is the property\nof whoever that provider is.\n\n107\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.760\nAnd that's one of the things that does\nkinda differ a little bit when we talk\n\n108\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.750\nabout on premise.\n\n109\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.240\nBasically just think of that term as fancy\nterm to say hey, I can see the server\n\n110\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.510\nover there, it's in our server closet\nin our building, you know, if you will.\n\n111\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.100\nSo email is one of the most, the biggest\nI would say platforms that we have today.\n\n112\n00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.960\nNow, this next one,\nsome of you are probably aware of, and\n\n113\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.740\nthat's social networks.\n\n114\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.410\nAnd there's all different kinds,\nand you could classify these.\n\n115\n00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.280\nSome people might look at something\nlike YouTube and say well, Wes,\n\n116\n00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.510\nI don't understand why you're\ncalling YouTube a social networking.\n\n117\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.650\nWell, if you've ever put you know\nmaybe a video of your friend or\n\n118\n00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.020\na video of your kids in your own account\nthere and people have made comments on it.\n\n119\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.360\nMaybe some of your friends and family,\n\n120\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.790\nI mean essentially you're\nsocial networking there.\n\n121\n00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.940\nSo you do have the more common ones that\nyou probably come to mind right away\n\n122\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.100\nis Facebook.\n\n123\n00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.240\nNow when I say prevalent,\nguys, I'm talking prevalent.\n\n124\n00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.770\nI was just reading some statistics and\nthese statistics were based off of just\n\n125\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.000\nabout a year ago, so\nabout a year out of date.\n\n126\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.620\nAnd it's kind of interesting,\n\n127\n00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.050\nthere are 1.67 billion likes\nin a single day on Facebook.\n\n128\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.615\nAnd that's just pushing a like if\nyou're familiar with the platform.\n\n129\n00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:49.929\nBut Twitter's the other one\nthat's out there as well and\n\n130\n00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:51.595\nyou probably seen Twitter.\n\n131\n00:06:51.595 --> 00:06:54.929\nKeep in mind one of the things that's\nkinda common to these are what is known as\n\n132\n00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:57.150\nhashtags and\nwe've got some other ones out there.\n\n133\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.740\nInstagram, again\nthe LinkedIn is another one.\n\n134\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.350\nTumblr and Google+.\n\n135\n00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.900\nThese are very, very prevalent.\n\n136\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.140\nThese are also things that you can use,\nkeep in mind,\n\n137\n00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.080\ncould be a business environment but a lot\ntimes if it's not a business environment,\n\n138\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.800\nit's really common in\nthe home market as well.\n\n139\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.770\nOne of the things that I want you to keep\nin mind when it comes to social networks\n\n140\n00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.120\nand this form of communication.\n\n141\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.940\nIs if you are doing this inside of\na business environment, remember there's\n\n142\n00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.020\nprobably some kind of legality behind the\nscenes that you might have to follow or\n\n143\n00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.242\ncomply with if you're posting\ninformation necessarily,\n\n144\n00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:36.240\nmay be related to your business.\n\n145\n00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.430\nWhile it does have its benefits,\nwhen it comes to communication,\n\n146\n00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.120\nlet's talk about what is the benefit?\n\n147\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.250\nWell, in the earlier days, before these\nsocial networks started to become really\n\n148\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.040\npopular, Dan comes out with the next\nlatest and greatest guitar design and\n\n149\n00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.740\nhe wants to go ahead and he wants\nto promote it to the world, right?\n\n150\n00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.291\nWell, now he's gonna be turning and\nburning emails.\n\n151\n00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:58.815\nHe's gonna be calling people, maybe\nsetting up an advertising campaign and\n\n152\n00:07:58.815 --> 00:08:03.199\nhas to get some air time on the TV What\nwas social networking today could be as\n\n153\n00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:06.120\njust easy as just posting\nit to a social network and\n\n154\n00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.690\nwithin minutes it can be\nexposed to 500,000 people.\n\n155\n00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.840\nSo it does have it's benefits,\nit is a very good communication source.\n\n156\n00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.500\nAnd like anything that\nwe have talked about and\n\n157\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.060\nhave talked about in this series when\nit comes to online communication,\n\n158\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.620\nyes it can have its pros, but it can\nalso have its cons, right there, Dan?\n\n159\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Wes, definitely good and\n\n160\n00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.400\nbad things have come in from the Internet,\nright?\n\n161\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.380\nWe've all seen that.\n\n162\n00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.660\nYou were hanging a clock in your bathroom,\n\n163\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.490\nyou slipped and fall on the toilet,\nand that's always embarrassing.\n\n164\n00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.670\nAnd then your friend posts that on\nFacebook, and then the whole world Is to\n\n165\n00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.850\nenjoy your humility and it's there\nforever and you can't ever get rid of it.\n\n166\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.360\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was saying, that's why\nI said YouTube technically could be\n\n167\n00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.650\nconsidered social networking\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n168\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.670\nWe're going to look for\nthat video of Dan later.\n\n169\n00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.715\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n170\n00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:51.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I might talk about a couple of other\n\n171\n00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.910\ncommunications technologies\nthat we have and\n\n172\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:59.320\nthere's a couple of them that might just,\nthey kinda goes together right?\n\n173\n00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.580\nWhen we talk about things like blogging,\n\n174\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.080\nwe talk about things like forums\nif you will, well let me show you.\n\n175\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.900\nThere's a couple of them out there too,\nwe have things like Tumblr,\n\n176\n00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:12.390\nwe have things like Squarespace and\nWordPress is one that's been out there for\n\n177\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:18.680\nawhile so it's really good for posting\nblogs about, well, give you an example.\n\n178\n00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.290\nI posted a blog for a while as I\nwas a technical instructor and\n\n179\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.110\nI would come across new technologies,\nand I wanted students to see those\n\n180\n00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.550\ntechnologies and see what I was getting\nexcited about when it comes to technology.\n\n181\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.880\nSo I created a WordPress account.\n\n182\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.090\nI could start to blog and\nkinda keep up to date on some\n\n183\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.840\nof the different technologies that are out\nthere and also to pass that benefit along\n\n184\n00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.490\nto some of the students I was teaching\nduring my time as a technical instructor.\n\n185\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.440\nForums are the other thing too.\n\n186\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.140\nForums come in all different shapes and\nsizes if you will.\n\n187\n00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.690\nI'll tell you one we use at\nthe ITProTV studios, kind of a lot,\n\n188\n00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.810\nis one that comes to mind\nis things like Technet,\n\n189\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.950\nmore specifically something\nthat's attached detected.\n\n190\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.513\nIt's called a social blog for\nMicrosoft.com when you're troubleshooting\n\n191\n00:10:03.513 --> 00:10:06.670\ndifferent functionalities with\nin computers or something.\n\n192\n00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.730\nA lot of time you can get a lot\nof good in Information there.\n\n193\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.670\nI know that we have people,\nco-workers here in the studios\n\n194\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.370\nthat like Android devices and\nbeing able to tinker and stuffs.\n\n195\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.050\nSo we go out to places like\nXDA-Developers which is another great\n\n196\n00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.690\nforum that you could look through and\nyou can communicate with other people.\n\n197\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.720\nAnd if you have questions,\nyou can also post questions.\n\n198\n00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.990\nSo, another good platform as\nfar as communications go.\n\n199\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:38.020\nNow another one that's just really taken\noff here is voice over IP guys, now.\n\n200\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.170\nSorry to feed you some alphabet\nsoup here on this one but\n\n201\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.400\nvoice over IP VoIP if you will.\n\n202\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.090\nAgain keep in mind that that's essentially\njust taking your analog communication or\n\n203\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.420\neven digital communication.\n\n204\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.680\nBut what you're doing is you're taking\nyour voice communications and putting\n\n205\n00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.980\nit on a TCPI base network so that you can\nroute it across the networks that exist.\n\n206\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.680\nAnd yes this does work over\ntraditional phone lines as well.\n\n207\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.380\nBut the purpose of voice over IP is\nthe fact that we can use existing network\n\n208\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.110\ninfrastructure.\n\n209\n00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.060\nAnd we don't have to,\nlet's say set up additional phone lines.\n\n210\n00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.280\nAnd you can see some of them are free and\nsome of them are paid.\n\n211\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.200\nAnd some of them are both.\n\n212\n00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.200\nFor instance,\nlet me give you an example here.\n\n213\n00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.830\nNow Vonage is definitely a pay for\nservice.\n\n214\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:22.455\nSkype, Skype is a free service and is also\na paid subscription-based service as well.\n\n215\n00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:24.740\nLet me give you an example.\n\n216\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:30.835\nI use Skype on-and-off to contact my wife,\nif I happen to be out\n\n217\n00:11:30.835 --> 00:11:35.845\nof the state that she's in but we also use\nthat here at ITPro TV as a business sense.\n\n218\n00:11:35.845 --> 00:11:36.965\nWe have Skype for Business.\n\n219\n00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:41.135\nSo as far as the functionality\ngoes a lot of times you get\n\n220\n00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:45.615\nadditional functionalities that are really\nneeded inside of the corporate environment\n\n221\n00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:48.625\nwith Skype for Business but you get\na lot of the basic functionality too in\n\n222\n00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:53.270\nthe regular Skype We also have FaceTime,\nwe also have things like Facebook.\n\n223\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.271\nWhere you can actually make things\nlike Facebook, voice over IP calls and\n\n224\n00:11:57.271 --> 00:12:01.528\nwe can now use our social networks if you\nwill to make those voice over IP calls so\n\n225\n00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:05.614\nyou can see there is kind of a blending\nof the communication technologies.\n\n226\n00:12:05.614 --> 00:12:09.338\nIn fact I'll mention\nthat type of blending of\n\n227\n00:12:09.338 --> 00:12:14.610\ncommunications as we get\nthrough more of these types.\n\n228\n00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.620\nSo couple other ones that\nI want to talk about.\n\n229\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.930\nWikis, one that comes to mind\nright away is probably Wikipedia.\n\n230\n00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.410\nYou've probably seen that out there.\n\n231\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.000\nThat is a form of communication.\n\n232\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.790\nYou might ask yourself well Wes how\nis that a form of communication?\n\n233\n00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.880\nWell there is communication done between\nthe people that write the information\n\n234\n00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.650\ninside the wiki and also you as yourself.\n\n235\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.680\nMaybe wanted to be an editor or\ncontributor of the Wiki.\n\n236\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.540\nI just happened to use Wikipedia here\nthere are all kinds of them that\n\n237\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.100\nare out there.\n\n238\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.196\nI'll tell you one,\nI'll show you my level of geekdum here.\n\n239\n00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:46.270\nI often go to Star Wars Wikis and\nTransformers Wikis.\n\n240\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.160\nImagine that so, and\nyou can communicate as well.\n\n241\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.400\nLike I said, I just use one of\nthe common ones out here that a lot of\n\n242\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.840\npeople are probably already aware of.\n\n243\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.740\nLast one I might mention here,\nDan, is the video conferencing.\n\n244\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.480\nAnd you can see a lot of the same\nfamiliar stuff coming up in\n\n245\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.130\nsome of these different categories.\n\n246\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.170\nAnd that's really getting to what I was\ngonna tell you about is the unified\n\n247\n00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.050\ncommunication.\n\n248\n00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.760\nYou might a called UC out there.\n\n249\n00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.760\nSo, if somebody talks about a UC server,\nremember we've talked about in another\n\n250\n00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.520\nepisode what server was,\nit’s just really powerful computer that’s\n\n251\n00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.590\nproviding services to the risk\nof my other computers, right?\n\n252\n00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.060\nWell if they say you seek a server,\n\n253\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.490\nthey're saying unified\ncommunications right?\n\n254\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.030\nAnd that's essentially what\nthings like FaceTime are,\n\n255\n00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.280\nFacebook offerings if you will.\n\n256\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.800\nSkype is another one that's out there.\n\n257\n00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.460\nMessages I believe in Android\nis another one that's there.\n\n258\n00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.940\nHangouts, that's what it's called,\nHangouts.\n\n259\n00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.980\nI forgot what the name was.\n\n260\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.120\nSo And then you, you know when it comes\nto the communications like I said there\n\n261\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.990\ncould be a blending of\nall of these together\n\n262\n00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.200\nthat make up what we call\nunified communications today and\n\n263\n00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.580\na lot of these platforms are searching,\nreally striving to have that.\n\n264\n00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.840\nSo you have one platform\nthat can do multiple things.\n\n265\n00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.500\nI kind of mention SMS,\nit's not on the screen here,\n\n266\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.890\ndon't really have a diagram for it, but\nkeep in mind text based communications\n\n267\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.780\nover your cellular service,\nagain remember that is available.\n\n268\n00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.040\nNow, when we talk about\nthese communications,\n\n269\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.490\nlet's just take a second here and\ntalk about,\n\n270\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.670\nwhat are some of the benefits that we see\nin these certifications, excuse me there.\n\n271\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.780\nIn some of these technologies.\n\n272\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.280\nIn some of these technologies\nthe big things is the distance.\n\n273\n00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.590\nWhen I think of the video conferencing\nwhen we do something FaceTime or\n\n274\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.540\nwhere we do something like\nmessaging where I can see my kids.\n\n275\n00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.910\nA few months ago I was in a completely\ndifferent county for a while and I did\n\n276\n00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.520\nwant to see my kids every night, you know,\nright before we go to bed and it bridged\n\n277\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.890\nthat distance gap that otherwise, without\nthese technologies, wouldn't be there.\n\n278\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.820\nBut it's also productivity\ninside of businesses, as well.\n\n279\n00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.890\nThink about if you have to\nmanage a meeting, right?\n\n280\n00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.930\nYou have a monthly meeting\nthat always has to happen, or\n\n281\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.056\nit could be a weekly meeting.\n\n282\n00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:58.605\nImagine the expense of setting\nup flights and scheduling and\n\n283\n00:14:58.605 --> 00:15:02.285\nmaking sure that the appointments\ncan be met and that people can\n\n284\n00:15:02.285 --> 00:15:05.945\nget whatever it is in the time allotted\nthat they can get this stuff done.\n\n285\n00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:09.865\nWell you can use technologies like that,\nnot only bridging the distance but\n\n286\n00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:13.255\nsimplifying and making your company\na little bit more productive and\n\n287\n00:15:13.255 --> 00:15:16.210\nsaving you a little bit more manpower and\ntime too so.\n\n288\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.180\nMost of these, all of these technologies\nreally I would start to be aware of\n\n289\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.480\neven on a basic level because\nyou're gonna see them eventually.\n\n290\n00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.430\nNow, the next one I'd like to\nmention is online conferencing,\n\n291\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.460\nand when we talk about online\nconferencing, there again,\n\n292\n00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.420\nyou're gonna see technologies that\nkinda do this blending right?\n\n293\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.720\nWhen I talk about online conferencing,\nwhat is the first and\n\n294\n00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.550\nforemost thing that we really have\nto know, what is it doing for us?\n\n295\n00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.270\nReal time communications is\nreally what helps us out, right?\n\n296\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.614\nWe get the ability to share,\n\n297\n00:15:46.614 --> 00:15:49.705\ngo a little bit farther than just\nvideo communications, right?\n\n298\n00:15:49.705 --> 00:15:53.203\nOr just audio communications,\nor just texting.\n\n299\n00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:54.830\nWe can blend all of those together,\n\n300\n00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.315\nincluding additional features like\nbeing able to share Computer screens.\n\n301\n00:15:58.315 --> 00:15:59.683\nRemember I was picking on Dan earlier.\n\n302\n00:15:59.683 --> 00:16:03.790\nI say he's got that guitar, right, that\ngreat guitar that he's gonna be putting\n\n303\n00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.960\ntogether soon, but\nhe might want a little bit of info, right?\n\n304\n00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.420\nA little bit of information on,\nhey, can we make this better?\n\n305\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.020\nDo you think it's good or not?\n\n306\n00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.630\nWell guess what,\nwell with online video conferencing,\n\n307\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.760\nnot only can I see\nthings like his desktop.\n\n308\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.529\nOr if he happened to share the file out,\nI can gain access to it, and\n\n309\n00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:22.364\ndownload it locally to my computer,\nbut it can happen in real time.\n\n310\n00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:26.972\nAnd that's one of the many benefits,\nagain, computer screen sharing,\n\n311\n00:16:26.972 --> 00:16:29.460\nfile sharing, applications as well.\n\n312\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.825\nYou have different types of applications\nthat allow for collaborative work during\n\n313\n00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:36.830\nan online conference as well,\nand that's always good.\n\n314\n00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:42.831\nUnified access to web-based content,\nagain out there across the Internet, and\n\n315\n00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:44.953\nthen we get things like the video and\n\n316\n00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:48.791\nthe voice conferencing too, and\nthese can get very expensive.\n\n317\n00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:52.285\nUnderstand that some of them can be,\nwhen we talk about conferencing,\n\n318\n00:16:52.285 --> 00:16:55.140\nif you're talking about high\ndefinition conferencing,\n\n319\n00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.068\nsome of the cameras could\nstart out at 4,000, right?\n\n320\n00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:01.548\nBut the great thing about it is,\nif your company doesn't have, or\n\n321\n00:17:01.548 --> 00:17:04.533\nmaybe you're just in this for\nyour personal endeavors,\n\n322\n00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:08.590\nright, you don't have to have those\nexpensive systems in order to use that.\n\n323\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:12.420\nThat's where some of these other\ncommunication types that really allow for\n\n324\n00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.390\nonline conferencing come in handy because\nyou can get something like a cheap webcam.\n\n325\n00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.370\nYou don't have to spend a lot of money,\nand sometimes you can even get this for\n\n326\n00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:23.820\nfree if you can handle a little bit\nof advertising that sometimes goes\n\n327\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.010\non when you are a non-paid customer.\n\n328\n00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.890\nNow we have a couple of different things\nthat you should be aware of when you're\n\n329\n00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.710\ndoing things like online conferencing,\n\n330\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.160\na lot of time it's access\nthrough a web browser.\n\n331\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.500\nIt doesn't have to be web\nbrowser based though.\n\n332\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.846\nYou could have something\nlike a stand alone client,\n\n333\n00:17:42.846 --> 00:17:46.646\nI know Cisco's got their clients out there\nfor all kinds of unified communication.\n\n334\n00:17:46.646 --> 00:17:50.128\nSo do keep that in mind,\nit could be the cloud based,\n\n335\n00:17:50.128 --> 00:17:54.020\na lot of times too,\nyou don't have to have it internally.\n\n336\n00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.320\nYou could have it on premise,\n\n337\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.130\nin fact we've got a couple of those\nsystems laying around here in the office.\n\n338\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.240\nAnd I'll tell you since we've really\nmoved to cloud things like Office 365,\n\n339\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.650\nsome of that equipment's\njust gaining dust here,\n\n340\n00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.030\nbecause of the benefits that you\nget through cloud computing.\n\n341\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:14.450\nSo again that also has a couple\nof models likewise as well.\n\n342\n00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.785\nSo what do we use?\n\n343\n00:18:16.785 --> 00:18:19.758\nWhat are some of the things that are,\nyou know that,\n\n344\n00:18:19.758 --> 00:18:24.641\nwebcam, no not webcam part things, excuse\nme, online conferencing allow us to do?\n\n345\n00:18:24.641 --> 00:18:28.140\nRight, again, it eliminates things\nlike distance restrictions.\n\n346\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:33.018\nTime, and a cost saver, again,\nthe scheduling lowers the company\n\n347\n00:18:33.018 --> 00:18:36.965\nresources in order to put\nthis conferences together.\n\n348\n00:18:36.965 --> 00:18:39.804\nFlexibility, that's one of the great\nthings is flexibility, right?\n\n349\n00:18:39.804 --> 00:18:41.970\nSorry Dan,\nI didn't bring my computer today.\n\n350\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.910\nI'm gonna have to miss\nout on the conference.\n\n351\n00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.500\nNo, Dan says well guess what, we've got\ntwo company computers, here is yours.\n\n352\n00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.272\nYou better be at the meeting and\nyou better be on time, sir.\n\n353\n00:18:50.272 --> 00:18:51.454\nPicking on you Dan,\nhe's just like that, just kidding.\n\n354\n00:18:51.454 --> 00:18:53.316\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've used all this kind of\n\n355\n00:18:53.316 --> 00:18:53.956\nstuff before.\n\n356\n00:18:53.956 --> 00:18:57.616\nI've worked in help desk support and\nthird level tier support,\n\n357\n00:18:57.616 --> 00:19:00.821\ninfrastructure support,\nyou name it, i've done it.\n\n358\n00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:03.479\nAnd a lot of times we use this\nto access our clients, right?\n\n359\n00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:05.482\nIf they're in a satellite office and\n\n360\n00:19:05.482 --> 00:19:08.790\nthey say,\nI'm having trouble with my web browser.\n\n361\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.210\nWell, if I don't have this kind\nof communications, what do I do.\n\n362\n00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.451\nI gotta say, what was it on the left\nhand side, could you describe it for me?\n\n363\n00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:19.842\nOkay, now you need to look toward\nthe bottom right hand corner of your\n\n364\n00:19:19.842 --> 00:19:23.474\nscreen and you can see all this,\nmight devolve really, really quickly.\n\n365\n00:19:23.474 --> 00:19:26.895\nAnd so, especially if the person on\nthe other end is not extremely technical.\n\n366\n00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:29.325\nBut if we use something like this,\nthen we're able to go in,\n\n367\n00:19:29.325 --> 00:19:31.825\nI'm able to share their\ncomputer screen with them.\n\n368\n00:19:31.825 --> 00:19:34.827\nI can move the mouse, if I need to drop\na file on their desktop, I can do that.\n\n369\n00:19:34.827 --> 00:19:39.467\nThat makes life a whole lot\neasier just in the purpose of,\n\n370\n00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:41.317\nI'm trying to help you\nget your computer fixed.\n\n371\n00:19:41.317 --> 00:19:44.367\nThen we move into a lot of use\nlike what Wes is talking about.\n\n372\n00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:48.107\nWe're in a conference room, we do this\nevery morning, we have a stand up meeting.\n\n373\n00:19:48.107 --> 00:19:50.667\nEverybody gathers in\nhere in studio one and\n\n374\n00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:52.317\nwe talk about what we're gonna do for\nthe day.\n\n375\n00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:55.564\nSome of our users live in other states,\nor not users, I'm sorry, our employees.\n\n376\n00:19:55.564 --> 00:19:59.000\nThey live in other states, but they want\nto be a part of that stand up as well.\n\n377\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.670\nSo we use something like this, right,\n\n378\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.270\nthis web communications, and video\nconferencing, to be able to bring them in.\n\n379\n00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.280\nThey get to say their piece and\nbe a part of the stand up,\n\n380\n00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.650\nthey don't have to miss out.\n\n381\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.500\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point.\n\n382\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.070\nI'd like to take a second to expand\na little bit on what Dan just said,\n\n383\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.130\nis that the customer service side of this,\nright?\n\n384\n00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.530\nHe's mentioning hey,\nas administrators this makes it easier for\n\n385\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.030\nus if we need to help people.\n\n386\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.860\nHow about the people on the other\nend that need the help, right?\n\n387\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.180\nHow do you think they might feel if\nthey're having to deal, like Dan said,\n\n388\n00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:29.670\nwhere it's over the phone, they're not\nreally adequate, not really proficient,\n\n389\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.120\nI guess you would say, a computer user.\n\n390\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.970\nAnd now I feel inadequate, and I feel\nlike I haven't accomplished my job, and\n\n391\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.190\nI'm holding everybody back.\n\n392\n00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.970\nBut now, Dan calls in and\n\n393\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.950\nhe says hey, I'm right here,\nI'm with you, I'm gonna help you out.\n\n394\n00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.565\nI can see what's going on right now.\n\n395\n00:20:43.565 --> 00:20:47.260\nYou can see me, so it brings more of\nthat personal nature to support, too.\n\n396\n00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.600\nSo that's a really good point,\nDan mentioned some of these already.\n\n397\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.300\nMeetings and conferences,\nthings like training sessions.\n\n398\n00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.320\nRight, training sessions,\n\n399\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.120\nimagine having to get a whole entire group\ntogether to train them on one product and\n\n400\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.700\nwhat it would take to do that if you\ndidn't have these type of technologies.\n\n401\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.270\nSo it gives you basically,\n\n402\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.670\nit saves you with the time that it\ntakes to bring a team together,\n\n403\n00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:14.800\ndo things like flight scheduling,\narrange for transportation costs.\n\n404\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.760\nAnd the organization and\n\n405\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.210\nscheduling behind it is another\nthing that it can help to alleviate.\n\n406\n00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.190\nDan, I would say one of the last ones\nthat we should talk about when it comes\n\n407\n00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.430\nto these technologies is\nthe concept of streaming.\n\n408\n00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.995\nNow it's kinda interesting,\nonline conferencing, video conferencing,\n\n409\n00:21:31.995 --> 00:21:34.985\naudio, [LAUGH] that all involves\nsome kind of streaming.\n\n410\n00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:36.205\n&gt;&gt; We're streaming right now.\n\n411\n00:21:36.205 --> 00:21:36.904\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\n\n412\n00:21:36.904 --> 00:21:39.671\nin fact if you're watching this live,\nyou're probably seeing it streaming.\n\n413\n00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:44.485\nAnd even if you're looking at the recorded\ncontent, it's streaming to you as well.\n\n414\n00:21:44.485 --> 00:21:45.735\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n415\n00:21:45.735 --> 00:21:49.225\nlet's talk about a couple of the concepts\nthat I really want you to be aware of.\n\n416\n00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:50.382\nFirst of all, what is stream?\n\n417\n00:21:50.382 --> 00:21:51.531\nAll right, what does that mean?\n\n418\n00:21:51.531 --> 00:21:56.400\nIt usually means real time, or\nclose to real time delivery of\n\n419\n00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.710\nsome kind of content whether\npre-recorded or live.\n\n420\n00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.174\nAll right, now there are a couple of\nthings that you should know as far\n\n421\n00:22:04.174 --> 00:22:06.099\nas terms like buffering, all right?\n\n422\n00:22:06.099 --> 00:22:07.655\nWhat is playback and buffering?\n\n423\n00:22:07.655 --> 00:22:10.579\nPlayback is the fact that, well,\nhey, I'm gonna be watching or\n\n424\n00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:11.970\nconsuming that information.\n\n425\n00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.530\nNow, buffering,\nif you've never heard of that term,\n\n426\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.690\nI want you to think about a staging area,\nright.\n\n427\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:22.090\nI've got for instance, I got a whole bunch\nof people being dropped off at the airport\n\n428\n00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.700\nand they've got their luggage, right.\n\n429\n00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.903\nThey really need to get that luggage to\nthat terminal, need to get it checked in.\n\n430\n00:22:28.903 --> 00:22:32.850\nSo what happens the moment\nyou show up at the airport?\n\n431\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.414\nA lot of time you've got somebody out\nthere willing to help you with your bags,\n\n432\n00:22:36.414 --> 00:22:37.341\nand what do they do?\n\n433\n00:22:37.341 --> 00:22:40.635\nThey put it on a cart, and\nit stays there while you go and park, or\n\n434\n00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:44.790\nif you've using valet, somebody else parks\nfor you while you can get that done.\n\n435\n00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.760\nThat's a staging area for your luggage\nbefore it gets to the terminal.\n\n436\n00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.544\nWell, I want you to think about playing\ninformation that needs continuous\n\n437\n00:22:51.544 --> 00:22:55.525\nplayback, right, that term playback,\nover the internet to your computer.\n\n438\n00:22:55.525 --> 00:22:58.850\nIn order to ensure an even\nexperience in the playback,\n\n439\n00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.973\nsometimes what happens is your\ncomputer and, more specifically,\n\n440\n00:23:02.973 --> 00:23:08.040\nthe device that's controlling the network\ncommunications will stage a little bit\n\n441\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.195\nof that information to make sure that you\nget a continuous playback experience.\n\n442\n00:23:13.195 --> 00:23:18.225\nEnsuring that, again that experience\nis not [SOUND] stutter like that.\n\n443\n00:23:18.225 --> 00:23:20.762\nI won't do that to you guys cuz\nyou're gonna start wondering\n\n444\n00:23:20.762 --> 00:23:22.015\nif our video is stuttering.\n\n445\n00:23:22.015 --> 00:23:22.847\n[LAUGH] But that's one of the things.\n\n446\n00:23:22.847 --> 00:23:25.490\nSo do know a little bit about buffering.\n\n447\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.970\nAnd now there are a couple of other little\nconcepts that I'd like to throw in here.\n\n448\n00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:33.060\nAnd one is bandwidth, all right,\nbandwidth, all right.\n\n449\n00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.675\nNow this is not the flexibility of your\nheavy metal band to perform additional\n\n450\n00:23:36.675 --> 00:23:38.590\nsongs.\n\n451\n00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.853\nBandwidth is more about the fact\nthat how much information,\n\n452\n00:23:42.853 --> 00:23:46.626\nif we were to take, for\ninstance, a cup, all right.\n\n453\n00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:48.830\nAnd we're gonna fill this cup up,\n\n454\n00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.794\nhow much liquid could it contain\nbefore it starts to run over?\n\n455\n00:23:52.794 --> 00:23:54.782\nI want you to think of your\nnetwork communications.\n\n456\n00:23:54.782 --> 00:23:59.970\nAll those cables that you've got\nrunning to the back of your computer.\n\n457\n00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.550\nMaybe it's a wireless network and\nyou don't have your radiated energy.\n\n458\n00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.060\nYou don't have connections.\n\n459\n00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.520\nWell imagine if you could\ncompletely fill up your network\n\n460\n00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.080\nwith as much information as it\ncould possibly hold at one time.\n\n461\n00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.010\nThat's your bandwidth, all right?\n\n462\n00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.810\nThe next thing I'd like to mention, and\nDan, I didn't put this one on the list,\n\n463\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.790\nbut that's cuz I forgot,\nis throughput, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:26.190\nThroughput is the concept of, okay, I know\nhow much liquid I can get in the cup.\n\n465\n00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:27.710\nBut how much is currently there?\n\n466\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.070\nWhether full or not,\nhow much is currently there?\n\n467\n00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:33.590\nSo if I see the cup as half full,\nmaybe I'm an optimist, right?\n\n468\n00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.070\nI see it as half full.\n\n469\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.500\nWell, that is what the actuality is.\n\n470\n00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.890\nWhat is actually there?\n\n471\n00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.750\nSo throughput is not the fact that\nhow much information, in totality,\n\n472\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.680\nI can put on my network, it's reality.\n\n473\n00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.160\nWhat is actually moving along the network?\n\n474\n00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.620\nSo there is a little bit\nof a difference here.\n\n475\n00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.028\nYou might say well, Wes,\nhow does that relate to streaming?\n\n476\n00:24:53.028 --> 00:24:55.260\nEverything, All right.\n\n477\n00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.297\nBecause if you have large files,\n\n478\n00:24:57.297 --> 00:25:02.118\nwe'll tell you what characteristics\nmake these files large here in a second.\n\n479\n00:25:02.118 --> 00:25:06.820\nBut if you have large files, you could get\na bad user experience by having a very\n\n480\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:11.166\nlimited band width, or if you have all\nthe bandwidth in the world that you\n\n481\n00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:15.940\ncould potentially need, but all of your\ndevices on your network are very slow,\n\n482\n00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.146\nthen your throughput what's actually\nhappening is also gonna effect\n\n483\n00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:24.610\nthe playback quality and\nalso increase things like your buffering.\n\n484\n00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.429\nThe more you buffer, the more delays\nare happening in that sequential stream of\n\n485\n00:25:28.429 --> 00:25:30.826\ninformation that's coming\ninto your computer.\n\n486\n00:25:30.826 --> 00:25:35.490\nData rate, okay, now data rate.\n\n487\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.260\nAnd you what?\n\n488\n00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.000\nDan before I get ahead of myself\n\n489\n00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.020\nlet's talk about a couple of\nmeasurements very briefly, right.\n\n490\n00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.020\nI wanna talk about kilobyte or kilobit.\n\n491\n00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.745\nActually I should say bytes,\n\n492\n00:25:47.745 --> 00:25:51.520\nwe talk a lot of times when we're talking\nabout communication across motherboards.\n\n493\n00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.970\nA lot of times, kilobit is what we'll\nmention when it's network communications.\n\n494\n00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.132\nBut, kilobits, megabits,\nand gigabits, all right.\n\n495\n00:25:58.132 --> 00:26:02.115\nRemember in another episode, we talked\nabout a kilobit being 1,000 bits,\n\n496\n00:26:02.115 --> 00:26:03.210\nall right.\n\n497\n00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:09.240\nA megabit being a 1,000 kilobits and\nthen a gigabit being 1,000 megabits right?\n\n498\n00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.730\nSo just up the line there so\nknow those terms guys.\n\n499\n00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.460\nCuz it really helps especially when it\ncomes to streaming media cuz you'll get to\n\n500\n00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.290\na website that says download it at 600 or\n760 kilobits.\n\n501\n00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.860\nWe have to know is that better or\n\n502\n00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:29.290\nworse if you pick the different\nexperience or qualities, right?\n\n503\n00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:33.860\nAnd that's directly related to the quality\nand the experience that you're gonna have.\n\n504\n00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.330\nData rate is something that's a little bit\ndifferent than some of the other concepts\n\n505\n00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:38.740\nthat we've talked about.\n\n506\n00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.850\nData rate really is the amount\n\n507\n00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:46.840\nof information that is sent to you in\norder to view that piece of content.\n\n508\n00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.260\nAll right, so for instance,\nI want you to think of it,\n\n509\n00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.250\nif I've got a very low quality video, the\ndata rate might be a little bit faster cuz\n\n510\n00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.520\nI don't have a lot of heavy lifting to do.\n\n511\n00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.785\nAnd I say heavy lifting, I'm not actually\nlifting anything, it's our network\n\n512\n00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:02.620\nadapters and all the network\ncommunications that are doing this.\n\n513\n00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:07.140\nHowever your data rate might slow\ndown if to view a single file\n\n514\n00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.810\nit's very large in size.\n\n515\n00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:13.600\nSo keep in mind that that is one of\nthe other contributing factors, right?\n\n516\n00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.500\nSo for example,\n250 kilobit data rate is going to be less\n\n517\n00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.500\ninformation coming into your machine\nthan a 600 kilobit data rates.\n\n518\n00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I kinda think of this way where\nif I had I took a photo, right, and\n\n519\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.070\nI did it with a five megapixel camera,\nlet's say four\n\n520\n00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:35.450\nmegabytes in size, that's a piece of data,\nthere it is, it's four megabytes.\n\n521\n00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:40.233\nTake the exact same photo that's\n20 megabits or 20 megapixels,\n\n522\n00:27:40.233 --> 00:27:42.840\nnow it's 22 megabits in size.\n\n523\n00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.020\nSame photo right, but\nthe data on each Is different.\n\n524\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.920\nThat's why one file is\nbigger than the other.\n\n525\n00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.120\nIf I try to pump that over to Wes, he\ntries to view it, it's gonna be easier for\n\n526\n00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.130\nhim to get and view the smaller file.\n\n527\n00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.750\nBecause he has less data to work with,\nit takes less time for\n\n528\n00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.490\nit to get to him because it's less data.\n\n529\n00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.070\nAnd then his computer can render it,\nhe can see it.\n\n530\n00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.550\nThe large file's gonna take more\ntime because it's more data.\n\n531\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:12.407\nHe would need larger throughput or\nlarger data rate on his machine\n\n532\n00:28:12.407 --> 00:28:16.930\nto get the same kind of speed\nthat it was for the smaller file.\n\n533\n00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.862\nSo if I had one computer that was slow and\none computer that was fast.\n\n534\n00:28:20.862 --> 00:28:24.490\nYou're gonna see a a very big\ndifference in the way in which\n\n535\n00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:28.350\nit processes information does it faster\nthe more data rate that you have.\n\n536\n00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.708\n&gt;&gt; That's right and that's impeccable\ntiming Mister Lowrie because we're gonna\n\n537\n00:28:31.708 --> 00:28:33.970\ntalk about, well,\nwhat does affect file size?\n\n538\n00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.770\nAnd he's already mentioned some of it.\n\n539\n00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.800\nI want you think about,\nhe mentioned the term high definition,\n\n540\n00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.090\nwell, what does that mean for\nus as far as the file size?\n\n541\n00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.420\nWell high definition usually\nmeans a higher resolution.\n\n542\n00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.940\nAll right, and\nI want you to think about it.\n\n543\n00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:52.210\nWhen we say higher resolution,\nthat increases the pixel count, right?\n\n544\n00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.290\nThink about it as a basket, right?\n\n545\n00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:57.230\nIf I have high definition,\nthe basket might be full but if I have\n\n546\n00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.960\nstandard definition, the basket might be\nhalf full that I need to carry, right?\n\n547\n00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.140\nSo file size gets bigger or\nsmaller depending on the quality.\n\n548\n00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.030\nAnd a lot of times the quality has\nto do with things like the data rate\n\n549\n00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.070\nin combination with what the file size is.\n\n550\n00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.490\nKeep in mind that the more\npixels you increase,\n\n551\n00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.490\nthe higher up you go into high definition,\nthe bigger the file gets.\n\n552\n00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.000\nNow why do we have to consider this,\n\n553\n00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.270\nwell then back to all those previous\ndefinitions that we were talking about.\n\n554\n00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:29.980\nIf I want a better quality I could have\na little bit more buffering going on,\n\n555\n00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.990\nbecause maybe all of the variables\nin between my computer and\n\n556\n00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.350\nwherever I'm consuming this information,\n\n557\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:41.650\nwherever it's being streamed from,\nstart to degrade the performance.\n\n558\n00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:42.970\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n559\n00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.260\nAgain, the bigger the file is,\n\n560\n00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.395\nthe greater bandwidth that it's\ngonna require in order to view that.\n\n561\n00:29:48.395 --> 00:29:52.305\nSo lot of different factors when we\ntalk about things like communications,\n\n562\n00:29:52.305 --> 00:29:56.205\nwhen we talk about conferencing,\nwhen we talk about streaming.\n\n563\n00:29:56.205 --> 00:29:57.975\nAnd, really,\nthey all kinda go hand-in-hand.\n\n564\n00:29:57.975 --> 00:30:00.735\nIt's one of the reasons I put them\ntogether because when you're doing online\n\n565\n00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:02.610\nconferencing, guess what you're doing?\n\n566\n00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.810\nYou're streaming information right?\n\n567\n00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.940\nWhen we talk about\ncommunications like face time,\n\n568\n00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.040\nwe talk about things like voice over IP.\n\n569\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.730\nWhat are you doing?\n\n570\n00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.500\nYou're streaming information right?\n\n571\n00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.420\nAnd it's as close to\nreal time as you can get.\n\n572\n00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:21.040\nSome of it's pretty darn close to real\ntime delivery but all of these little\n\n573\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.150\nfactors and some of these definitions can\nreally come into play when you talk about\n\n574\n00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.310\nthe communications that you're\ngonna use on a day to day basis.\n\n575\n00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:33.380\n&gt;&gt; Wes, great job explaining on how this\ncourse is called living online, right.\n\n576\n00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.860\nAnd we just explained to you about\nevery aspect of living online.\n\n577\n00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:41.260\nSocial media, voice over IP,\nvideo conferencing,\n\n578\n00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.540\nweb use, web conferencing,\nyou name it, it's all there.\n\n579\n00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.750\nThis is stuff that we\nuse on a daily basis.\n\n580\n00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:51.360\nHopefully now after today's show you are a\nlittle more equipped to better understand\n\n581\n00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.150\nhow those processes are working and\nto work with those devices and\n\n582\n00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.340\nservices themselves.\n\n583\n00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.050\nWes thanks again for dropping by and\nexplaining those concepts.\n\n584\n00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.610\nWe thank you for watching but\nit's time to sign off.\n\n585\n00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.634\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n586\n00:31:03.634 --> 00:31:04.633\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n587\n00:31:04.633 --> 00:31:06.456\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n588\n00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:15.290\n[SOUND]\n\n",
