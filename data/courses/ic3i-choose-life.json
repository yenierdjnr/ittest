00:00:17.069\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:20.502\nyou're watching\nthe Computer Fundamentals IC3 show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:23.671\nWhere we're about to take a look at some\nof the different computing fundamentals\n\n6\n00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:26.480\nthat we need to know about and\ntaking a look at the industry.\n\n7\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.239\nHere to help us out is gonna be Dr.\nTonny Omwansa.\n\n8\n00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.740\nDr. Tonny, welcome to our studios.\n\n9\n00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.760\n>> Thank you very much for having me here.\n\n10\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.995\nGlad to meet you as well.\n\n11\n00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:39.550\n>> Dr. Tonny, what is it that we really\nneed to know when we start talking about\n\n12\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.920\nthe ideas of computer basics.\n\n13\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.260\nIf we're actually trying to understand\nthis idea of getting into computing\n\n14\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.800\nas field.\n\n15\n00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.130\n>> So the journey of computing is really,\n\n16\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.160\nreally wide,\nI mean you cover a lot of stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.430\nBut the good thing about\ncertifications and training programs\n\n18\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.980\nis that they help us to understand these\nthings in a very sequential manner.\n\n19\n00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.750\nSo we're gonna start with the basics.\n\n20\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.340\nIn today's session, we're gonna\nexplore about five key objectives.\n\n21\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.320\nThe first one is we want to\nunderstand the information systems.\n\n22\n00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.400\nAs you can hear, it talks about a system.\n\n23\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.840\nSo we'll spend some time\non information system.\n\n24\n00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.520\nWe'll look at the key types of computers.\n\n25\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.780\nThink about the different types and\nthe different strengths and\n\n26\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.500\ndifferent capabilities on that.\n\n27\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.130\nAnd then we also try to\nunderstand information systems.\n\n28\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.170\nWhat kind of software types do we already\nhave out there and what do they do?\n\n29\n00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.580\nAnd then we will also look at the\ncomponents of the computer and finally,\n\n30\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.650\nconclude how do the computers communicate?\n\n31\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.529\nThat's basically what we're\ngonna cover in this show.\n\n32\n00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:41.191\n>> All right, so\n\n33\n00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:44.285\nwhen we start talking about the idea\nof information systems then,\n\n34\n00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:48.650\nhelp us to understand what that really is\ntalking about and what that really means.\n\n35\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.880\n>> All right, so you're already\nsaying that it's a system, all right.\n\n36\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.760\nNow a system means very many\nthings coming together and\n\n37\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.810\ncommunicating in different ways,\nall right.\n\n38\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.560\nSo for purposes of the information systems\nin this context, we think about people.\n\n39\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.810\nBecause it takes people to\ninteract with computers.\n\n40\n00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.210\nSending information or\ndata into the system,\n\n41\n00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.160\ncreating, provoking the computer\nto behave in certain ways.\n\n42\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.750\nAnd then secondly, we've got hardware.\n\n43\n00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.700\nThese pieces that are put together,\nsomething we see,\n\n44\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.210\nsomething we touch, something we can hear,\nsomething we can speak into.\n\n45\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.550\nThat's just the pieces of\nhardware put together.\n\n46\n00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.720\nThen we got software and\n\n47\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.516\nsoftware has different levels, we've got\nsoftware that interact with the hardware.\n\n48\n00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:31.380\nSoftware that they get to interact with,\nsoftware that will enables me to do\n\n49\n00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.480\nsomething very specific tasks and\nthen we've got procedures.\n\n50\n00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.030\nYou see software can only act on\nthe basis of certain procedures,\n\n51\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.410\ncertain sequence of instructions.\n\n52\n00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.390\nAnd then finally, we've got data.\n\n53\n00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.470\nAnd data is what we can input in,\nit can get processed.\n\n54\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.114\nAnd it becomes information and\nthen gradually becomes knowledge.\n\n55\n00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:53.920\nSo that's really roughly when we\nthink about information systems.\n\n56\n00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.590\nWe think about all those components put\ntogether, interacting in a meaningful way.\n\n57\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.510\n>> Now when you start talking about\nan interaction in a meaningful way as far\n\n58\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.740\nas people goes.\n\n59\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.160\nThe whole goal then for\n\n60\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.860\nus as people, right, is to insure that\nwe understand what the requirement is.\n\n61\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.070\nSo a person that's using computer, they\nneed to understand that what it is that\n\n62\n00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.260\nthey're actually trying to do or what is\nit they're trying to get out of it, right?\n\n63\n00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.790\n>> Right.\n\n64\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.510\n>> Okay, and then we take a look\nat the idea of the hardware,\n\n65\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.260\nis also understanding what we need\nto do to get the information.\n\n66\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.620\nWhat are the actual things that\nwe have to have in place and\n\n67\n00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.600\nunderstanding whether or\nnot that particular type of hardware.\n\n68\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.220\nCan be able to provide\nus the information or\n\n69\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.360\nwe need other types of hardware\nto help us out as well.\n\n70\n00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.330\nAnd then of course,\nsoftware is also an important part of it.\n\n71\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.300\nBecause without the software,\n\n72\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.940\nwe are then lost because\nthe hardware can only do so much.\n\n73\n00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.715\nSoftware helps us to\ninterpret the information.\n\n74\n00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:53.786\nAnd then of course, procedures help us to\ninteract with that software that we know\n\n75\n00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:54.972\nwhat to do, what to do.\n\n76\n00:03:54.972 --> 00:03:57.487\nAnd then of course,\nthe data whether it's inputting or\n\n77\n00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.690\nwhat the result is that\nwe're trying to get out.\n\n78\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.960\nSo all of those make up the idea of\nthe information system, correct?\n\n79\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.120\n>> Correct.\n>> Okay, so\n\n80\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.320\nwith that understanding of the information\nsystem, we have to understand that\n\n81\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.230\neach element is important,\nwe cannot leave out anyone of them, right?\n\n82\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.320\n>> That's correct.\n\n83\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.670\nThey all must interact together and\n\n84\n00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.680\nsometimes they probably\ndon't interact together.\n\n85\n00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.840\nAnd that means you also don't get\nthe kind of output that you want or\n\n86\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.150\nthe kind of functionality that you want.\n\n87\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.470\nSo ideally all these elements must work in\ncommunication and in a coordinated manner.\n\n88\n00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.020\n>> All right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n89\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.690\n>> So when we start to take a look\nthen as far as what you and\n\n90\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.280\nI might be doing to try and\nget to work with computers.\n\n91\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.780\nWe also have to understand that there\nare gonna be multiple different types of\n\n92\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.520\ncomputers that we run into as well.\n\n93\n00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.170\n>> Yeah.\n>> The only thing that I'm really familiar\n\n94\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.670\nwith are something like\nmaybe a desktop computer but\n\n95\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.580\nthere are other types that we\nhave to worry about to, right?\n\n96\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.730\n>> That's correct, so\nwe've got a number of computer types.\n\n97\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.460\nAnd when you said desktop computer,\n\n98\n00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.460\nit will give you some kind of sense that\nit is somewhere on a desktop, right?\n\n99\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.750\nSo we call it desktop PC or\npersonal computer for that matter.\n\n100\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.470\nAnd it is called a personal computer for\n\n101\n00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.860\na reason, because it's kind of for\none person use.\n\n102\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.220\nOccasionally someone else can come and\n\n103\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.020\nuse the same computer, but at the same\ntime, typically one person gets to use it.\n\n104\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.830\nIt's got a box out there, so\nyou see the CPU, it's got a monitor,\n\n105\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.180\nit's got a keyboard and\nthat's on the table.\n\n106\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.020\nSo it's kind of like a workstation where\nyou're working on a regular basis.\n\n107\n00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.350\nThen other than that, we've got notebooks.\n\n108\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.860\nAnd some people call it a notebook PC or\nothers call it a laptop.\n\n109\n00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.440\nSo it's the same kind of thing\nlike a personal computer,\n\n110\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.060\nit is actually personal.\n\n111\n00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.050\nBut the advantage is that\nyou can move around with it.\n\n112\n00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.090\nSo you wouldn't be able to move around\nwith a PC, walking around with a big box.\n\n113\n00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.760\nSo typically, the output device for\n\n114\n00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.220\na laptop as well as the keyboard,\nthey're kind of connected together.\n\n115\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.450\nSo you would flip it and then you get to\nsee what is coming out of the computer.\n\n116\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.550\nOr whenever you're typing things,\nyou'd be able to see on your screen and\n\n117\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.710\nthen you've got the keyboard\nmounted on to the same device.\n\n118\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.880\nOther bits and\npieces like the speakers and\n\n119\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.650\nthen the mouse sometimes are all\ninterconnected together.\n\n120\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.910\nSo that it is one small portable device.\n\n121\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.270\nThat's why it's called anyway,\nnotebook, so\n\n122\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.850\nit gives you a sense like if\nit's almost the size of a book.\n\n123\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.830\nThen we've got tablet,\nas technology has evolved,\n\n124\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.020\nnow we've got other devices that are much\nsmaller, more friendly, more flexible.\n\n125\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.570\nSo tablet PC, again,\nit's a personal computer.\n\n126\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.570\nSo you can walk around\nwith it now in this case,\n\n127\n00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.170\nthe keyboard really is\na software version of it.\n\n128\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.940\nSo it's not a physical keyboard\nthat you're getting to see.\n\n129\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.780\nThough sometimes you might\nget some tablets maybe\n\n130\n00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.870\nhaving some kind of a physical keyboard,\nbut ideally it's a digital keyboard.\n\n131\n00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.400\nYou send in an instruction and\nthe keyboard appears and\n\n132\n00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.110\nthen you can type your stuff out.\n\n133\n00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.180\nAnd finally, we've got a smartphone and\nnow as you can see over here,\n\n134\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.600\nI've got a simple smartphone that I use,\nit is actually a computer.\n\n135\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.360\nIt actually has the same\nfunctionalities as a typical computer.\n\n136\n00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.730\nBut it is more friendly and flexible and\nfor very specific functions.\n\n137\n00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.880\nThe capability of course is a lot smaller.\n\n138\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.770\nSo those are the typically four different\ntypes of computers that we can talk about.\n\n139\n00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.270\nBut these computers are what we can\nclassify as personal, whereby ideally,\n\n140\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.460\none person gets to use them at a time.\n\n141\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.280\nBut then we've got another\nmulti-user kind of computers.\n\n142\n00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.170\nAnd in this case, we've enable people to\nuse the same computer at the same time,\n\n143\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.690\nwe can say it is multi-user.\n\n144\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:49.510\nSo we've got Savas, ideally Savas would be\nset somewhere for a very specific usage.\n\n145\n00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.329\nThey can be date for data management,\nthey can be for email.\n\n146\n00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:55.082\nThey can be for specific functions and\n\n147\n00:07:55.082 --> 00:07:57.446\nthey can handle a lot of\nprocesses at the same time.\n\n148\n00:07:57.446 --> 00:08:00.154\nThen we've got mainframes and\nmainframes are much larger.\n\n149\n00:08:00.154 --> 00:08:05.310\nWe get main frames in rooms And then we've\ngot several computers connected to them.\n\n150\n00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.410\nAnd then the largest is a supercomputer.\n\n151\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.190\nIt really is gonna do the same thing but\nmuch larger.\n\n152\n00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.670\nIt can handle a lot of\nprocesses at one time.\n\n153\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.560\nIt can handle a lot of\nusers at the same time.\n\n154\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.860\nThey are normally stored it in much,\nmuch larger spaces.\n\n155\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.220\nAnd they are all computers.\n\n156\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.180\n>> So when we start taking a look, then as\nfar as basics go, when we start talking\n\n157\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.000\nabout the personal computer, that's\nprobably where somebody that is just\n\n158\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.320\ngetting started will end up really trying\nto understand how things are gonna work.\n\n159\n00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.740\nThe idea what you're just\nmentioning super computers,\n\n160\n00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.780\nthat's not something that I would\nuse on a daily basis, I don't think.\n\n161\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.670\n>> No you wouldn't.\n\n162\n00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.650\nAnd they're special kind of usage,\nall right?\n\n163\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.479\nSo people who manage weather focusing or\nthey need to do a lot of analytics\n\n164\n00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:50.760\nof large chunks of data as airlines for\nexample.\n\n165\n00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.310\nThink about it.\n\n166\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.150\nA lot of transportations happening, a lot\nof data, a lot of people moving up and\n\n167\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.000\ndown, all that is data\nneeds to be analyzed.\n\n168\n00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.960\nNow you and\nI don't get t use that on a regular basis.\n\n169\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.960\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> Probably we\nmight get a report, we might get some\n\n170\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.580\noutput from a super computer but that's\nnot all we use on a day to day basis.\n\n171\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.110\nFor us, the four different Different pc's\nare the ones we will interact with mostly.\n\n172\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.660\n>> So\nwhen we start talking about those and\n\n173\n00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.190\nI want to focus in on those personal\ncomputers, because that's probably\n\n174\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.590\ngenerally where we'll probably\nspend the majority of our time.\n\n175\n00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.710\n>> Yes.\n>> Is that the desktop computers,\n\n176\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.040\njust like what Dr. Toney was describing\nis what we'll normally see on a day\n\n177\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.720\nbasis if we go to work in a company\nthat tends to work with computers.\n\n178\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.012\nYou'll have your workstation set up\nthere and the limitation that Dr.\n\n179\n00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:36.410\nToney told us about here is\ngonna be that limitation of\n\n180\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.520\nbeing tethered to that one location and\nnormally limited to one use at a time.\n\n181\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.560\nBut you might find yourself in a company\nthat might issue you a computer so\n\n182\n00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.730\nthat you can also do\ncomputing while traveling.\n\n183\n00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.730\nAnd that might be something that,\nyou know, or on the go, or mobile, and\n\n184\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.640\nit's gonna be something like a laptop or\neven a tablet.\n\n185\n00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.910\nAnd then today in our connected world\nwe're probably gonna see, of course,\n\n186\n00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.450\nsmartphones a lot more.\n\n187\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.410\nSo those are probably the components\nthat somebody starting off with computer\n\n188\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.860\nfundamentals if they were to say\nday-to-day what they were to work on,\n\n189\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.750\nthat's probably where it will begin.\n\n190\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.780\nBut you also mentioned that\nidea of the server as well, and\n\n191\n00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.860\nin a company we also tend to see servers\nthere, because it helps them to centralize\n\n192\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.258\nsome of the storage or\nthe applications that you've mentioned.\n\n193\n00:10:20.258 --> 00:10:24.060\nE-mail is probably one of the biggest\nexamples in our companies\n\n194\n00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.230\nthat we end up using.\n\n195\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.450\nSo, we will actually end up prying,\n\n196\n00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.960\ncountering all those different\ntypes of technologies.\n\n197\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.170\nBut, that personal computer, type of\ncomputers that we're talking about here is\n\n198\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.910\nprobably the most interactive that you and\nI are gonna get when we first begin.\n\n199\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.530\nOkay.\n\n200\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.840\nAll right, now.\n\n201\n00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.250\nNow that we've talked\nabout hardware just a bit,\n\n202\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.158\nwe have to understand the need for\nsoftware.\n\n203\n00:10:48.158 --> 00:10:54.200\nSo Dr. Toney, if I get a computer that's\nsitting on my desk and it doesn't have any\n\n204\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.509\nsoftware on it at all, okay, is it really\nany better than a rock sitting on my desk?\n\n205\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.210\n>> That's a nice way to put it.\n\n206\n00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.740\nIt's almost useless, [LAUGH] well,\nin the context of what you want it to do,\n\n207\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.350\nall right?\n\n208\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.430\n>> Right.\n>> So you want it to be able to take some\n\n209\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.600\ninstructions and do something for\nyou, something productive.\n\n210\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.153\nSo that's where the concept\nof software comes in.\n\n211\n00:11:19.153 --> 00:11:23.480\nNow, I've got some images on my screen for\nthe computer.\n\n212\n00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.130\nAnd what happens is,\nthis is a personal computer.\n\n213\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:33.130\nNow what I'm pointing at here is\nbasically the brain of that computer.\n\n214\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.620\nAnd then this is some\nkind of output device, so\n\n215\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.900\nit is gonna display something to us and\nthere's a keyboard here that we're gonna\n\n216\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.520\nuse to input somethings\nonto the computer and\n\n217\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.005\nwe've got some mouse here that also helps\nus to control that particular computer.\n\n218\n00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:50.785\nSo software is, what you're really\nstarting to see on the screen is\n\n219\n00:11:50.785 --> 00:11:54.885\na reflection of what software can do and\nwe've got different levels of software.\n\n220\n00:11:54.885 --> 00:11:57.455\nSo think about it.\n\n221\n00:11:57.455 --> 00:12:02.085\nWe have this piece which we're calling\na computer and it must take some\n\n222\n00:12:02.085 --> 00:12:05.960\ninstructions and those instructions\nare coming now in form of software.\n\n223\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.157\nSo we've got different levels,\n\n224\n00:12:08.157 --> 00:12:12.640\nat the base I like to use this\ndiagram to go up the ladder, right.\n\n225\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.320\nSo at the base is what I\ncould call system software.\n\n226\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.530\nSo the system software is a little\nhard for you and I to understand but\n\n227\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.260\nit's what enables the hardware\nto interact, all right.\n\n228\n00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.790\nSo if I send something to the printer,\nso I want something to be printed.\n\n229\n00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.420\nSo somewhere at the base there for\n\n230\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.650\nhardware to communicate,\nwe're gonna start with system software.\n\n231\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.030\nNow I'll give you two\ntypes of system software.\n\n232\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.770\nAt the very, very basic is the basic\ninput output system, BIOS.\n\n233\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.140\nSo basically when we turn on\na computer that kind of a system\n\n234\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.400\nsoftware that is already embedded in\nthe computer will check about different\n\n235\n00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.195\nfeatures if everything okay\nbefore the computer turns up,\n\n236\n00:12:51.195 --> 00:12:53.285\nit's operating system in\nthe right place etc etc.\n\n237\n00:12:54.605 --> 00:12:57.885\nThen slightly above that,\nlet's talk about the operating system.\n\n238\n00:12:57.885 --> 00:13:01.625\nSo basically this is what provides\nthe interface that enables you\n\n239\n00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:03.780\nas a user to interact with the computer.\n\n240\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.060\nIt enables you to run\napplications on the computer.\n\n241\n00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.350\nIt enables you to manage files.\n\n242\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.030\nIt enables you to display things.\n\n243\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.760\nSo it's the operating system\nthat manages the computer.\n\n244\n00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.500\nThen above that operating system,\nwe're gonna get another layer.\n\n245\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.900\nWe've got some utilities.\n\n246\n00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.310\nThink about it, if we want to compress\nfiles, or we want to check if there\n\n247\n00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.030\nare viruses in the computer, for\nwe've got a set of utilities out there.\n\n248\n00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.890\nThen let's go a little bit above that.\n\n249\n00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.140\nWe've got application software.\n\n250\n00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.970\nSo what you and I get to interact with\non a computer is application software.\n\n251\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.970\nIt could be software to\nimprove productivity,\n\n252\n00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.020\nit could be software to\norganize certain things.\n\n253\n00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.790\nSo that's what you and I get to interact.\n\n254\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.310\nNow ideally we don't get to see\nreally how the operating system\n\n255\n00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.720\ngets to work at the base.\n\n256\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.380\nThat's hidden.\n\n257\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.600\nWe call it encapsulation, so\nwe don't get to see that, but\n\n258\n00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.310\nwe see the interface of how\nthe computer basically is working,\n\n259\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.730\nhow files are organized in there, how\napplications are organized in there, but\n\n260\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:06.235\nat the end of the day we tend to interact\nmostly with the application software.\n\n261\n00:14:06.235 --> 00:14:09.115\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt that when we\nstart taking taking a look at it seems\n\n262\n00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:13.175\nlike the software and hardware they have\nto actually be kind of united together\n\n263\n00:14:13.175 --> 00:14:17.405\nin working for us to be able to get\nthat particular piece of computing\n\n264\n00:14:17.405 --> 00:14:20.305\nsystem that we have to interact\nwith people, which is you and\n\n265\n00:14:20.305 --> 00:14:23.795\nme, so that we can actually get\nthe data out of it that we need to.\n\n266\n00:14:23.795 --> 00:14:28.360\nAnd so, now we're starting to see the very\nbasics of that information system forming.\n\n267\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.570\nRemember that what we took a look at here\nso far is that idea of the BIOS itself and\n\n268\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.500\nthe way that Dr. Toney described\nit as a system type of software.\n\n269\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.370\nThat really does come in something\nthat you and I do not normally have to\n\n270\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.840\ninteract with because it's actually at\nthe factory where they go ahead and\n\n271\n00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.640\nput that on there so that the motherboard\nand the hardware components can also talk.\n\n272\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.750\nAnd then for us to have an interface and\nthat's a great way to put it, Dr Toney,\n\n273\n00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.380\nis that this is our interface into\nthe computer is the operating system and\n\n274\n00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.430\nit provides for\nus really four basic functions, right?\n\n275\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.500\nThat user interface, of course is the\nfirst one, and then it allows to build and\n\n276\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.280\ntake an application in which\nDr Toney also described, and\n\n277\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.210\nwe can install all that on top of\nthe operating system as well, and\n\n278\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.640\nallows us to be able to run that\noperating system and it also controls for\n\n279\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.170\nus of course the file system as well, how\nwe manage, and how we store files on it.\n\n280\n00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.720\nAnd then be able to also send\ninformation to hardware components so\n\n281\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.340\nthat we can communicate with them as well.\n\n282\n00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.050\nThe idea the operating system\nitself is probably the most\n\n283\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.560\nprolific one that we then see universally,\nright on all computer systems.\n\n284\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.300\nAnd so when you hear things like\nMicrosoft Windows and Linux\n\n285\n00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.015\ndistributions that are out there and\nMacintosh, OSX, all\n\n286\n00:15:43.015 --> 00:15:47.715\nthese are actually examples of operating\nsystems that we might also end up finding.\n\n287\n00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:52.189\nNow, in the application world though\nthat's were we get into specific things\n\n288\n00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:56.342\nthat relate to duties or functions that\nwe tend to do on a day to day basis.\n\n289\n00:15:56.342 --> 00:16:00.839\nSo, the way that Dr. Toney described it is\nprobably where we tend to interact more\n\n290\n00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:02.346\noften than any place else.\n\n291\n00:16:02.346 --> 00:16:04.928\nAnd I've seen this happen over,\nand over again Dr.\n\n292\n00:16:04.928 --> 00:16:08.389\nToney In which somebody's an expert\nat one particular application,\n\n293\n00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:12.760\nbut they may not know anything else about\nthe rest of the computer system itself.\n\n294\n00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.500\nBut they are really good\nat that one application.\n\n295\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.348\nAnd so that is their foundation, but\n\n296\n00:16:17.348 --> 00:16:21.464\nbecause you're actually entering into\nthe world of computing systems itself and\n\n297\n00:16:21.464 --> 00:16:25.699\ninformation systems, you wanna at least\nhave a basic, fundamental understanding\n\n298\n00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:29.154\nthat there is more than one application\nthat we tend to deal with and so\n\n299\n00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:32.050\nthat's why we wanted to\nintroduce this concept as well.\n\n300\n00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.674\nSo software and hardware are kind\nof our fundamental starts\n\n301\n00:16:35.674 --> 00:16:40.400\nwhen we start dealing with the idea of\ncomputers here and what we have to know.\n\n302\n00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.820\nNow when we start then to take look\na little bit deeper at the idea\n\n303\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.610\nof the computer's we wanna go into\nsome of those different components.\n\n304\n00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.560\nSo, Dr Tony what are we going to talk\nabout first when we start talking about\n\n305\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.420\ncomponents of the computer?\n\n306\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.880\n>> Wow, that's gonna be a long journey and\nwe're just basically at\n\n307\n00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.500\nthe foundation stage as we get\nalong we get deeper and deeper.\n\n308\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.320\nSo think about the computer\nsystem components.\n\n309\n00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.191\nIt tells you that there are many things\nput together that are going to enable\n\n310\n00:17:08.191 --> 00:17:09.612\nthe computer to function.\n\n311\n00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:12.270\nSo let's start with the first one,\nthe input.\n\n312\n00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.430\nThe second one, processing.\n\n313\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.400\nThe third one, output.\n\n314\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.240\nThe fourth one, storage.\n\n315\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.850\nSo let's think about those four\ncomponents that come together,\n\n316\n00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.980\nso every time you're interacting with\nthe computer chances are that you're gonna\n\n317\n00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.340\ninput something into the computer\nwhich then will be processed and\n\n318\n00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.930\nthen will come out as a form of output.\n\n319\n00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:38.180\nAnd then we possibly could destroy it,\neither internally or outside.\n\n320\n00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.890\nSo that's kind a lot of sequence.\n\n321\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.970\nSo let's think about the input.\n\n322\n00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:47.200\nIf I start typing something on a keyboard,\nthen my keyboard becomes an input device.\n\n323\n00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.025\nIf I were speaking on a microphone,\nto store something onto the computer,\n\n324\n00:17:52.025 --> 00:17:55.487\nthen my microphone is,\nactually, an input device.\n\n325\n00:17:55.487 --> 00:18:00.086\nSo, let's say, I am moving a mouse, so\nthat I can type something somewhere,\n\n326\n00:18:00.086 --> 00:18:04.875\nor click something somewhere, then my\nmouse is, basically, an input device.\n\n327\n00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:08.300\nAll right, so now the input devices\nthere are three typical examples and\n\n328\n00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.970\nthere are many other as well I can\nhave a scanner that can capture some\n\n329\n00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.950\ndocument into the computer etc.\n\n330\n00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.230\nThen we've got the processing devices.\n\n331\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:22.060\nSo inside that computer there are pieces\nput together that enable us to\n\n332\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.340\nprocess that data that we'll\nactually input into the system.\n\n333\n00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.670\nThink about the motherboard.\n\n334\n00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.240\nSo the motherboard, right at\nthe base internally in the computer,\n\n335\n00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:37.470\nis a set of pieces put together that\nenable the computer to function.\n\n336\n00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.510\nThink about the processor,\nwhich processes content.\n\n337\n00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:46.300\nThink about the memory that can either\nstore temporarily or even permanently.\n\n338\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.746\nSo, that's a device in there\nas part of processing.\n\n339\n00:18:49.746 --> 00:18:50.964\nThink about buses,\n\n340\n00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:54.410\nbuses are the ones that enable data\nto move from one point to another.\n\n341\n00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.060\nSo, if I was typing something\nhere on the keyboard so\n\n342\n00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.630\nthat data has to move into some process\nsomewhere or some memory device somewhere.\n\n343\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.630\nSo that bus will allow that\ndata to move in there.\n\n344\n00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.860\nSo that's the second category, processing.\n\n345\n00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.270\nThe third beat is a output so\n\n346\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.100\nsome how we get to see things\neither physically or digitally.\n\n347\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:18.700\nSo on the screen the display screen\nbasically is an output device for\n\n348\n00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.820\na computer or for\nbasically the smart phone,\n\n349\n00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.970\nwhat you're seeing there is\na display kind of screen.\n\n350\n00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.600\nWe can print something and so,\nthe printer then becomes an output device.\n\n351\n00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.180\nWe could easily play some music on a\ncomputer and we get to hear the sound and\n\n352\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.600\nthat's an output device, it's just\ngetting the output in a certain format.\n\n353\n00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.210\nAnd then the last set of\ncategory device is storage.\n\n354\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.270\nNow think about it, when you type\nsomething, it's sometimes get stored\n\n355\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:53.100\nsomewhere or we need to do a computation\nof one plus one to get two, that means one\n\n356\n00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.610\nmust have been stored somewhere, the other\none must have been stored somewhere.\n\n357\n00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:00.750\nAnd then the instructions which a plus\nmust have been stored from somewhere and\n\n358\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.832\nthen the truth that comes out of it,\nis stored somewhere.\n\n359\n00:20:03.832 --> 00:20:06.837\nSo we've got storage\nmechanism in a computer.\n\n360\n00:20:06.837 --> 00:20:11.080\nIt could be temporary or permanent.\nIt could be internal or\n\n361\n00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.570\nexternal to the computer.\n\n362\n00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.150\nAnd that all those\nare basically forms of storage.\n\n363\n00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:19.310\nWe've got flash disk, we talk about\nhard disks, we talk about memory stick,\n\n364\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.730\ndifferent terms, here and\nthere, but, basically,\n\n365\n00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:26.500\nall that is storage, that's a fourth\ncategory of the components of a computer.\n\n366\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.660\n>> So, when we start taking a look\nat the components to a computer, and\n\n367\n00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.390\nwe're, probably,\ngonna dive into this a little bit\n\n368\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.120\ndeeper-\n>> Yes.\n\n369\n00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.070\n>> We need to understand it's,\nreally, primary purpose,\n\n370\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.970\nthen, and you describe that as input,\nprocessing, output, and storage.\n\n371\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.640\nWhen that input devices\nare things like keyboards,\n\n372\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.960\ntouchscreens if happen to\nhave one on your smartphone.\n\n373\n00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.650\nThey're gonna be things you\nmentioned a microphone,\n\n374\n00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.020\nI didn't even think about that one.\n\n375\n00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.200\nA microphone that may actually lead\ninto software that's recording on your\n\n376\n00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.410\ncomputer as well.\n\n377\n00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.690\nThese are all different\ntypes of input devices.\n\n378\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.980\nAnd you may say,\ndo I really need all of them?\n\n379\n00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.780\nNot necessarily You do need\nsome of them to function.\n\n380\n00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.880\nBy far, the most basic one that we tend to\nfind on every personal computing device\n\n381\n00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.800\nat some point of time is gonna\nbe some type of keyboard.\n\n382\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.210\nNow, the keyboard is a very essential\nelement to all of computing, so\n\n383\n00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.490\nyou're not gonna rid of\nthat one anytime soon.\n\n384\n00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.140\nBut just kinda realize that keyboards and\nmice, however you wanna do it.\n\n385\n00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.250\nAnother type of input pointing\ndevice is what we also have.\n\n386\n00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.589\nSo those are components that you wanna\nmake sure that you're familiar with and\n\n387\n00:21:29.589 --> 00:21:32.233\nwe're gonna probably see those\na little bit later on as well.\n\n388\n00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:37.420\nThe processing part is probably gonna\nbe the more technical of the components\n\n389\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.647\nthat we tend to see because that\nis really the true processing or\n\n390\n00:21:41.647 --> 00:21:47.067\nthe part that does all the math, all the\nhard stuff that we actually want it to do,\n\n391\n00:21:47.067 --> 00:21:50.140\nso it can actually run\nthings like formulas.\n\n392\n00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.831\nIt can create the output\nthat we need to see.\n\n393\n00:21:52.831 --> 00:21:55.296\nSo that processing cycle is a part of it,\nand\n\n394\n00:21:55.296 --> 00:21:59.710\nyou may even of course also need then data\ninput in there that can be processed.\n\n395\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.100\nAnd then the output of\ncourse will be data as well.\n\n396\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.710\nIn terms of output, remember that what Dr.\nTony told us here.\n\n397\n00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.730\nAnything that gives us the result from\nthe computer and system that we need.\n\n398\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.120\nA lot of times the most primary\noutput device that you and\n\n399\n00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.300\nI are gonna run into is\na monitor of some sort.\n\n400\n00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:20.950\nEven on our small smart phones, the screen\nitself is really an output device and\n\n401\n00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.630\nthen an input device at the same time.\n\n402\n00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.754\nBut it is because we tend\nto see the message there,\n\n403\n00:22:24.754 --> 00:22:28.157\nthat we actually called an output device\nand then of course different storage.\n\n404\n00:22:28.157 --> 00:22:33.657\nAnd storage is where the most of the\nhardware today is proliferating like crazy\n\n405\n00:22:33.657 --> 00:22:39.238\nthe very fact we can store a tremendous\namount of information on very tiny little\n\n406\n00:22:39.238 --> 00:22:44.770\na memory card today and even gigantic\nhard drives that are actually out there.\n\n407\n00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.520\nIt just tends to let you know that this\nparticular idea that computing system\n\n408\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.200\nis continue to actually grow and\nchange as time goes on to smaller and\n\n409\n00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.440\nfaster components as we start seeing.\n\n410\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.170\nSo there's a lot more to go.\n\n411\n00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.688\nWe just kind of gave you\na surface overview but\n\n412\n00:22:59.688 --> 00:23:03.879\nmake sure you remember those particular\ntypes of components as we move on.\n\n413\n00:23:03.879 --> 00:23:06.480\nSo what else do we need to think about,\nDoctor Tony here?\n\n414\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.380\n>> I think of these fundamental stage\nyou've really, really put it well.\n\n415\n00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.440\nI think the other we need to think about\nthese fundamental stages that computers do\n\n416\n00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.820\ncommunicate, all right, and information\ncan be sent from one computer to another.\n\n417\n00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.500\nSo computers are not\nnecessarily in isolation.\n\n418\n00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.860\nThey are actually possibly interconnected,\nand so\n\n419\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.160\nit's important to think about\nhow do computers communicate.\n\n420\n00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.740\nNow we've got primarily\ntwo ways that we can\n\n421\n00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.420\nclassify the kind of communication\nthat happens between computers.\n\n422\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.382\nOne is where it is wired, so it's\nphysically connected between computers and\n\n423\n00:23:41.382 --> 00:23:46.194\nwe've got standards there that we'll\ntalk about Ethernet that enable us to\n\n424\n00:23:46.194 --> 00:23:50.331\nmake computers to communication\nwith one another or we could have\n\n425\n00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:54.725\nwireless methods for communicating and\nwe could talk about Wi-Fi.\n\n426\n00:23:54.725 --> 00:23:57.472\nAnd some of us maybe have\nheard about Wi-Fi out there.\n\n427\n00:23:57.472 --> 00:24:02.080\nThat enables two devices to communicate\nwithout being physically connected between\n\n428\n00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:02.849\nthemselves.\n\n429\n00:24:02.849 --> 00:24:07.771\nOr we could use Bluetooth which is\njust another method of enabling\n\n430\n00:24:07.771 --> 00:24:12.090\ndevices to communicate in\na short range of the distance.\n\n431\n00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.950\nAll right, but more important is that\n\n432\n00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.930\nthese computers don't get to\ncommunicate just by themselves, or\n\n433\n00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.370\nyou don't just get yourself to enable\nthese computers to communicate.\n\n434\n00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.690\nWe've got the Internet.\n\n435\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:28.667\nInternet is a world wide interconnection\nof computers that is managed\n\n436\n00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:31.040\nusing certain set of standards.\n\n437\n00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.743\nRight now, we're not gonna going\nto the details of those standards.\n\n438\n00:24:34.743 --> 00:24:39.390\nBut it is important to note that Internet\nservice providers are the ones that\n\n439\n00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:44.280\nprovide the service for computers to\nconnect to the Internet, all right.\n\n440\n00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.710\nSo it comes at fee, yes, so\nyou may be the one paying the fee or\n\n441\n00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.290\nsomeone else is paying the fee for you.\n\n442\n00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:53.143\nBut the very fact that you've connected to\nthe Internet, somehow in the background\n\n443\n00:24:53.143 --> 00:24:55.811\nyou're interacting with\nan Internet service provider.\n\n444\n00:24:55.811 --> 00:25:00.803\nAnd someone, somewhere is paying for\nit, but the beauty is you're connected.\n\n445\n00:25:00.803 --> 00:25:04.715\nNow, it's now possible to\nconnect your personal computer,\n\n446\n00:25:04.715 --> 00:25:10.450\nyour laptop computer, your mobile device,\ntablet, smartphone, you name it.\n\n447\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.910\nAnd there you go, powered and connected.\n\n448\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.935\n>> So, a lot of times what we see then is\nthe idea of those computers actually have\n\n449\n00:25:17.935 --> 00:25:19.454\ntechnology built into them.\n\n450\n00:25:19.454 --> 00:25:22.110\nWhether it's hardware and software,\nwhich is normally what it is.\n\n451\n00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:26.010\nAnd some hardware component and then some\nlittle bit of software that allows for\n\n452\n00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.662\nthe communication that we\nwere just talking about.\n\n453\n00:25:28.662 --> 00:25:31.160\nAnd the idea of actually being\non connected to the ethernet,\n\n454\n00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.010\na lot of time or ethernet,\nhowever you want to pronounce it.\n\n455\n00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.020\nI don't know which one's proper\n[LAUGH] and I say them both.\n\n456\n00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.260\nSo in this sense, right, that there's\nactually gonna be a physical component\n\n457\n00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.680\nthat allows us to directly cable in.\n\n458\n00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.370\nSo we normally talk about, of course,\nthose components in networking.\n\n459\n00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.850\nWe talk about things like actual,\nphysical cables.\n\n460\n00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.020\nSo we might have a cable that plugs\ndirectly into the computer and\n\n461\n00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.650\nyou just match up that\nparticular connector.\n\n462\n00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.260\nAnd you look for the port on the back\nof the computer or somewhere.\n\n463\n00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.840\nNow if that doesn't happen,\n\n464\n00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.440\nlike on my device you may end up having\nto actually have another adapter.\n\n465\n00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.496\nAnd so\nlet me see if I can pull mine off here for\n\n466\n00:26:08.496 --> 00:26:11.200\na moment to show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n467\n00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.650\nSo on my computer, there is not one of\nthose physical ports on the computer\n\n468\n00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.380\nto be able to connect in\nthis type of network.\n\n469\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.540\nSo I have to have a device like this, and\nthis one has the physical port, here.\n\n470\n00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.890\nBut it plugs into, well, one of my\ncomputer ports on the computer itself.\n\n471\n00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.570\nAnd that allows me to get\nthat type of connection.\n\n472\n00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.290\nBut what if I don't have any of that?\n\n473\n00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.845\nWell, even my laptop, and I'm assuming Dr.\n\n474\n00:26:32.845 --> 00:26:37.051\nTonny's laptop also, has what they\ncall a wireless network adapter on it.\n\n475\n00:26:37.051 --> 00:26:40.150\nThat allows us to connect wirelessly\njust like the way that Dr.\n\n476\n00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.750\nTonny was talking about.\n\n477\n00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.459\nAnd usually we see there that idea of\nusing WiFi, if you might hear that term,\n\n478\n00:26:45.459 --> 00:26:46.728\nor the idea of Bluetooth.\n\n479\n00:26:46.728 --> 00:26:51.560\nTwo different technologies that allow\nus to connect wirelessly as well.\n\n480\n00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.820\nAnd then mentioning the idea\nof the Internet and\n\n481\n00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.470\nInternet service providers is also a key.\n\n482\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.005\nNetworks by themselves,\nthey absolutely do work as long,\n\n483\n00:27:01.005 --> 00:27:05.049\nas you don't need any other data\ncoming in, you're perfectly fine.\n\n484\n00:27:05.049 --> 00:27:08.679\nBut most of us tend to have to connect to\nother places and the Internet is by far\n\n485\n00:27:08.679 --> 00:27:12.238\none of the most popular networks that\nyou're gonna end up connecting to.\n\n486\n00:27:12.238 --> 00:27:14.888\nWithout it, e-commerce goes down,\nin other words,\n\n487\n00:27:14.888 --> 00:27:17.550\nyou don't tend to see all\nthe trade that we have today.\n\n488\n00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.976\nYou don't tend to see all\nthe proliferation of online businesses\n\n489\n00:27:20.976 --> 00:27:21.800\nas well.\n\n490\n00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.350\nSo the Internet is a fascinating place for\nus to actually be, but\n\n491\n00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:29.140\nat least understanding the basics\nof it is gonna help us out as well.\n\n492\n00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.288\nThat is something that we can connect to,\nbut it does come at a fee as well.\n\n493\n00:27:33.288 --> 00:27:36.700\nSo Dr. Tonny, is there anything else that\nwe need to understand as far as just\n\n494\n00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.189\na basic overview when we start with\nthis idea of computer fundamentals here?\n\n495\n00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.880\n>> Well, I think we've covered\nthe foundation and that sets the pace for\n\n496\n00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.990\nus now to start moving deeper\ninto very many specifics.\n\n497\n00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.570\nIt's just important to note that,\ntypically you and\n\n498\n00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.970\nI are users of the computer, all right.\n\n499\n00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.820\nAnd so\nwhen the computer's functioning fine,\n\n500\n00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.360\nthen we can do some very specific tasks.\n\n501\n00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:09.040\nImprove our productivity, serve others,\n\n502\n00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.000\ncommunicate to other people and\ndo different kind of things on a computer.\n\n503\n00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.080\nThere are people who are experts,\nwho fix computers, who assemble computers.\n\n504\n00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.250\nAnd if you really want to become\nan expert you can of course grow.\n\n505\n00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.360\nAnd that's part of why we go\nthrough this kind of training,\n\n506\n00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.000\nso that we build our\ncapacities to become better.\n\n507\n00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.360\nBut it's important to also to remember\nthat in the kind of world that we're\n\n508\n00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.550\nliving right now,\ncomputing is becoming like a basic need.\n\n509\n00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.510\nYou really need to be able\nto get this thing right,\n\n510\n00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.880\nyou need to be able to turn on a computer,\nuse it, communicate with others,\n\n511\n00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.600\nwrite reports, summarize your work, etc.\n\n512\n00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.310\nAnd it is important to understand that\nthere are very many components and\n\n513\n00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.420\nthey all serve specific purposes.\n\n514\n00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:53.220\nSo just for purposes of wrapping up this\nsection, we've basically done five things.\n\n515\n00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.770\nOne, if we try to explain that\nthe computer is a system,\n\n516\n00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:00.601\nthe different elements, and\nthe information system takes speed,\n\n517\n00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:04.380\nprotects data, takes processes and\nall that put together.\n\n518\n00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:10.050\nSecond is that we've thought about how\nare the computers types organized.\n\n519\n00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.945\nSo there are personal computers,\ndifferent types we've talked about.\n\n520\n00:29:13.945 --> 00:29:16.793\nThat those which we don't have\nto interact with ourselves, but\n\n521\n00:29:16.793 --> 00:29:20.610\nwe can have many people interact with\nthem as well, that's the second bit.\n\n522\n00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:25.120\nThe third we try to understand software,\nso think about system software,\n\n523\n00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.310\nthink about application software.\n\n524\n00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.390\nAnd then the fourth we looked at\nthe computer system components, the pieces\n\n525\n00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.670\nthat come in together interconnected in\na way and enable us to use a computer.\n\n526\n00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.770\nAnd finally, we thought about how\ndo the computers communicate and\n\n527\n00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:42.910\nthat's where connectivity came in,\nwhether it is physical or otherwise, and\n\n528\n00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.140\nfinally concluded with the Internet and\nits power.\n\n529\n00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.440\nSo roughly that's what we've done at the\nfoundation stage and in the next show and\n\n530\n00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.890\nnext episode we'll get into more details.\n\n531\n00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:53.744\n>> So thank you Dr.\n\n532\n00:29:53.744 --> 00:29:57.287\nTonny for really helping us to\nunderstand the computer basics here.\n\n533\n00:29:57.287 --> 00:30:00.116\nAnd really taking look at it as\na serious part of the future and\n\n534\n00:30:00.116 --> 00:30:02.835\nthe way that we are actually\nmoving our lives and helping us\n\n535\n00:30:02.835 --> 00:30:06.700\nactually make our lives a little bit\nbetter as well by understanding it.\n\n536\n00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.230\nSo it's a great place to also end this\nepisode, signing off for ITProTV,\n\n537\n00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.550\nI've been your host Ronny Wong.\n\n538\n00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.750\n>> And my name is Dr. Tonny Oswansa.\n\n539\n00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.578\nIt's been great interacting together,\nthinking through the foundation and\n\n540\n00:30:17.578 --> 00:30:19.847\nhope to see you next time\nin the next sessions.\n\n541\n00:30:19.847 --> 00:30:23.619\n>> Stay right here for\nmore computing fundamentals.\n\n542\n00:30:23.619 --> 00:30:30.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.569\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:20.029\nyou're watching the computing\nfundamentals IC3 show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.554\nNow, we've already previously talked about\nthe idea of information systems, and\n\n6\n00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:28.400\ntalked about the basics of human\ninteractions with computing.\n\n7\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.440\nNow we're getting into,\n\n8\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.140\nwell, the computer system itself,\nalso known as the system unit.\n\n9\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.730\nAnd who better to help us in understanding\n\n10\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.015\nthe components inside of a system\nunit than Dr. Tonny Omwansa?\n\n11\n00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:41.190\nDr. Tonny welcome back with us.\n\n12\n00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.800\n>> Thank you very much for having me here,\n\n13\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.150\nI am always enjoying myself,\nRonnie, with you.\n\n14\n00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.040\nAnd getting into the details of computing\nand trying to see how do we use a computer\n\n15\n00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.540\nfor transforming our productivity,\nimproving the quality of work we do.\n\n16\n00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.290\nAnd so we have to understand what it\nis we are working with as we go on.\n\n17\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.740\n>> All right, so when we start off and\nwe say that, here it is,\n\n18\n00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.430\nwe now are interested in\nthe idea of computers and\n\n19\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.120\ncomputing and\nusing it inside of our lives.\n\n20\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.595\nWe want to begin, of course,\n\n21\n00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:15.795\nwith just a simple understanding of what\ncomponents we're normally dealing with.\n\n22\n00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:19.440\nNow most of us might just say no I just\nwanna work with it, which is fine.\n\n23\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.650\nBut if you actually are gonna be\nliving in an age of computing and\n\n24\n00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.880\nyou're gonna be dealing with computers on\na daily basis, it helps to have at least\n\n25\n00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.050\na foundational understanding of what\nactually is happening inside of that\n\n26\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.730\nbox that we tend to see siting beside\nus or even inside of a laptop at times.\n\n27\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.090\nTo just understand that there's some\ndifferent components in there and\n\n28\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.700\nthat's what we're gonna show you today.\n\n29\n00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.790\nSo Dr. Tonny, where are we gonna begin?\n\n30\n00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.240\n>> Yeah, thanks very much for\n\n31\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920\nshowing the value of why we must go\nthrough this kind of an exercise.\n\n32\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.920\nBecause think about it sometimes\nyou are buying a computer,\n\n33\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.390\nyou need to know what you're buying.\n\n34\n00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.290\nTwo computers might look the same but\n\n35\n00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.780\none is two times the cost of the other one\nbecause of some capabilities that it has.\n\n36\n00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.700\nSo it's important to understand\nat the very basic level,\n\n37\n00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.020\nwhat is a computer made of?\n\n38\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.270\nAnd then from there,\n\n39\n00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.930\nyou can move on to trying to figure out\nsomebody tells you something is broken,\n\n40\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.750\nwhat is that broken thing and\nwhere can I possibly get it, all right?\n\n41\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.570\nSo, where we'll begin is we'll\ntry to understand, first of all,\n\n42\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.150\nhow is data processed in a computer.\n\n43\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.360\nWe'll get a sense of what is processing,\nhow is this content processed in there?\n\n44\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.090\nAnd then we'll try to look at things\nlike memory, think about functions or\n\n45\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.017\nthink about ports or think about buses or\n\n46\n00:02:34.017 --> 00:02:39.610\nthink about elements of input, output.\n\n47\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.570\nWe'll go along the way and then we'll\nhave to master things as we go along,\n\n48\n00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.420\nbut this is really,\nreally a foundation stage.\n\n49\n00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.430\nYou may have had something\ncalled a motherboard,\n\n50\n00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.250\nat least we'll explain\nto you what that is.\n\n51\n00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.020\nOr think about, how is power supplied\nonto the computer, how does it come out?\n\n52\n00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.830\nThink about it, if a computer hangs,\nyou may have had something hangs.\n\n53\n00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.140\nOr simply, the computer is not\nfollowing any more instructions,\n\n54\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.510\nit's not displaying anything on your\nscreen, what could you possibly do?\n\n55\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.100\nThose are some of the things that we'll be\ndiscussing in this particular episode and\n\n56\n00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.930\nI hope people find value in that.\n\n57\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.750\n>> That sounds like a great idea,\nDr. Tonny.\n\n58\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.920\nNow, when we begin,\nwe want to take a look of course at\n\n59\n00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.156\nwhat generally is called the CPU,\nthe Central Processing Unit.\n\n60\n00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:26.520\nNow, Dr. Tonny, when I look at this, it\njust looks like a little piece of metal,\n\n61\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.490\nbut there's a lot more that goes in that\nparticular little piece of metal, right?\n\n62\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.620\n>> Absolutely, I mean,\n\n63\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.760\nyou look at someone, they tell you they've\ngot a brain up in their head, all right?\n\n64\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.960\nAnd let's just go okay, fine,\nit just looks like a small thing there.\n\n65\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.840\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n66\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.080\nthe brain really ships every single\nthing that is about the human body.\n\n67\n00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.530\nSo similarly, the central processing unit,\nfirst of all,\n\n68\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.410\nit's important to understand\nwhy we call it a system unit.\n\n69\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.580\nWe call it a system unit because it\nhas several things put together.\n\n70\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.220\nAnd at the heart of all those things\nis a central processing unit,\n\n71\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.780\nwhich we need to understand.\n\n72\n00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.680\nYou hear people talking about CPU,\nCentral Processing Unit,\n\n73\n00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.090\nwhich is the main process of the computer.\n\n74\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.590\nAny computer will at least have\none Central Processing Unit.\n\n75\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.530\nSome computers may have several depending\non the kind of capacity needed and\n\n76\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.950\nthey can all be put together pre-designed\nby the supplier, and all those things but\n\n77\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.679\nat least there is one\nCentral Processing Unit.\n\n78\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.900\nAnd it is called a processing unit\nbecause it processes, all right?\n\n79\n00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.870\nSo, when you give instructions to\na computer and you press a button and\n\n80\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.800\nsay you want it to come on,\n\n81\n00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.770\nthe central processing unit\ndoes some processing of data.\n\n82\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.910\nAnd that central processing unit\nhas several components in it.\n\n83\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.826\nLot of components I think it's\nimportant for us to understand,\n\n84\n00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:50.734\nand what I have basically done, displayed\non my screen is an illustration of what\n\n85\n00:04:50.734 --> 00:04:54.647\nthe central processing unit does,\nthe components that it has.\n\n86\n00:04:54.647 --> 00:04:57.477\nWhat you're seeing there is a layout,\n\n87\n00:04:57.477 --> 00:05:02.640\njust to help us graphically understand\nhow the processing unit works.\n\n88\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.745\nIt has basically about three components,\nnow data comes\n\n89\n00:05:07.745 --> 00:05:14.123\nin central processing unit and\ndata can come in terms of actual values or\n\n90\n00:05:14.123 --> 00:05:19.250\ninstructions of what to\ndo with those values.\n\n91\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.180\nSo those are two things\nthat really will come in.\n\n92\n00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.440\nAnd then what comes out is an execution,\n\n93\n00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.340\nthe outcome of an execution of\nthe instruction that was submitted.\n\n94\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.010\nOf course maybe it was an addition, so you\nwant it to do one plus one to get to two,\n\n95\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.800\nso the instruction there is add,\nand then the values are one and\n\n96\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.230\none and then the output will be two.\n\n97\n00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.340\nSo in there, there is a control unit,\nthere is an arithmetic and\n\n98\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.950\nlogic unit, and\nthere are different types of registers.\n\n99\n00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.370\nSo the easy one to understand\nthere is a register,\n\n100\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.570\ndata register or instruction register.\n\n101\n00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.110\nSo their instructions and\ndata are stored in register.\n\n102\n00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.080\nSo it's a temporary way of holding\n\n103\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.035\nbits of information of data that\nthen I use to do certain things.\n\n104\n00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:13.095\nAnd then we've got the Controlling Unit\nwhich decodes the instruction.\n\n105\n00:06:13.095 --> 00:06:17.610\nSo somebody somewhere has to try and\nunderstand what was that instruction?\n\n106\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.840\nAnd their instruction is decoded,\nthe decoded expound and\n\n107\n00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.440\nunderstand what exactly that\ninstruction was, that's a control unit.\n\n108\n00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.090\nWhich then will pass it\nonto the arithmetic and\n\n109\n00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.210\nlogic unit,\nwhich then will execute that instruction,\n\n110\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.360\npulling them together,\nthe data that was put in the register.\n\n111\n00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.370\nSo you can see those three\nthings put together.\n\n112\n00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:46.000\nAll right, and now then ultimately\nthe control unit will then put the result,\n\n113\n00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.410\nsince the one that kind of\nmanages the movement of data and\n\n114\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.140\ninstructions it will put the result in\na register that is holding the results.\n\n115\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.585\nSo right there on the screen there is a\ndata register 1, there is a data register\n\n116\n00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:01.200\n2, there is an instruction register and\nthere is a result register.\n\n117\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.690\nSo what came in through the central\nprocessing unit was data and instructions.\n\n118\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.411\nAnd the control unit\nsimply did the decoding,\n\n119\n00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:13.800\ntried to understand what\nis being asked of us here.\n\n120\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.060\nIt will put the 2 bits of data into\nthe register 1 and register 2,\n\n121\n00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.060\nthat's 15 and 3.\n\n122\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.580\nAnd then it will interpret the\ninstruction, and tell the arithmetic and\n\n123\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.700\nlogic unit, please compute a division,\n\n124\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.280\ndivide 15 by 3 and\ntell me what the result is.\n\n125\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.020\nWhen you get the results, it puts\nthe results into the result register, and\n\n126\n00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.010\nthen it can come up.\n\n127\n00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.110\nNow for\nus we've seen what the CPU has done.\n\n128\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.857\nBut basically what is happening in\nthere is that there was work being\n\n129\n00:07:42.857 --> 00:07:47.270\ndone by control unit, the arithmetic and\nlogic unit, as well as the register.\n\n130\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.924\nNow, you and I don't get to worry\ntoo much about all these details but\n\n131\n00:07:50.924 --> 00:07:54.331\nat least we've gotten a sense,\nroughly, what's happening.\n\n132\n00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:58.451\nAnd we can have very complex\nprocesses being done by the computer.\n\n133\n00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:03.092\nBut then, on the very basic label,\nit's a CPU that is simply\n\n134\n00:08:03.092 --> 00:08:08.470\nconducting these kind of operations\nat a very, very high speed.\n\n135\n00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.528\nThere's so many of similar transactions\nbeing done in every, every single second,\n\n136\n00:08:13.528 --> 00:08:17.880\nin order for it into generate so\nmuch output that we normally see.\n\n137\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.390\nI don't know.\nDoes that sound like something that we\n\n138\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.290\nneed to understand, and it's useful?\n\n139\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.320\n>> It really is by far the thing that\nmakes the computer do everything that\n\n140\n00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.560\nwe need it to do, right.\n\n141\n00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.201\nAnd the key point here is not that you\ncouldn't have done the arithmetic that Dr.\n\n142\n00:08:32.201 --> 00:08:36.620\nTony just walked us through, and\nwe all probably can do some of that, but\n\n143\n00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.020\nthe key is what he mentioned there\nabout how fast this is done.\n\n144\n00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.980\nA lot of times,\nespecially in today's modern computers,\n\n145\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:49.100\nyou're talking about billions\nof times in which those\n\n146\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.710\ntypes of functions can be done or\nthat type of arithmetic can be done.\n\n147\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.260\nSo it's not you and\nme just doing a mathematical quiz or\n\n148\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.450\ndrill of me understanding what\nmy multiplication tables are.\n\n149\n00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.220\nBut the actual CPU itself can process and\n\n150\n00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.870\ndo the instructions as well as the data\nat billions of times per second.\n\n151\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:18.220\nNow, that is a magnitude of thinking\nthat I cannot even comprehend.\n\n152\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.602\nWhen I think about it as being per second,\nnot over a lifetime but\n\n153\n00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:26.659\na single second that a CPU is on,\nthere are complex programs\n\n154\n00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:30.895\nthat are constantly sending data and\nthose instructions in.\n\n155\n00:09:30.895 --> 00:09:34.942\nAnd is able to do it so quickly and\ngive us the results so quickly, and\n\n156\n00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:38.270\nthat is why we actually\nwant to understand that.\n\n157\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.266\nSo when you do end up seeing where\na particular computer like Dr.\n\n158\n00:09:42.266 --> 00:09:44.850\nTony was describing that you\nmay want to purchase and\n\n159\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.800\none is again,\ntwice as expensive as the other one.\n\n160\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.650\nWell now you understand that hey,\nthat CPU is doing something special.\n\n161\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.590\nAnd when you start seeing those numbers\non them a lot of times, it's pretty much\n\n162\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:03.480\ntelling you how fast that particular\nCPU maybe working versus another one.\n\n163\n00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.450\nAnd so of course you're gonna pay for\n\n164\n00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:11.810\nthat luxury of the speed that you actually\nhave in those systems in the processing.\n\n165\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.484\nNow, when we start taking a look at that\nwe don't tend to break everything down to\n\n166\n00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:20.332\nthe level that Dr. Tony did, but\nit at least gives you that basis of\n\n167\n00:10:20.332 --> 00:10:24.840\nunderstanding what is actually doing\nat the most basic mathematical level.\n\n168\n00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.640\nNow you also have, when we see it,\nwhen we understand it,\n\n169\n00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.990\nis that as data comes in, it's always\ngoing through a cyclical type of process.\n\n170\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.210\nAnd Dr. Tony,\nwe call that the machine cycle, I believe?\n\n171\n00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:37.740\n>> Yeah.\n\n172\n00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.520\nWe call it machine cycle.\n\n173\n00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.540\nIt's one thing that you will always\nget every time you think about\n\n174\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.960\nhow does a computer work?\n\n175\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.640\nIt's simply and\nI put it displayed on my screen.\n\n176\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.730\nIt's simply about fetching instructions,\n\n177\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.330\nfetching data from memory and saying\nwell what am I going to do with that?\n\n178\n00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.830\nThe next thing will be I will decode.\n\n179\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.910\nSo the CPU simply tries to\nread that instruction and\n\n180\n00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.600\ntranslate into a language that the\narithmetic and logic unit will understand.\n\n181\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.160\nSo two things have happened.\n\n182\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.530\nFetch, try to interpret and understand.\n\n183\n00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.350\nThat's the control unit doing that,\nand then telling the arithmetic and\n\n184\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.110\nlogic unit, do something.\n\n185\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.320\nSo what does that do?\n\n186\n00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.240\nIt does the execution.\n\n187\n00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.160\nSo if the arithmetic logic\nexecutes those instructions and\n\n188\n00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.980\nthen move the result into\nsome form of storage.\n\n189\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.877\nSo, that data now, the output of that\nexecution is going to be stored somewhere,\n\n190\n00:11:34.877 --> 00:11:38.360\nand typically it will be\nstored in some memory.\n\n191\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.240\nWe will talk about memory later.\n\n192\n00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.470\nSo, even the way that kind\nof like the brainwash,\n\n193\n00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:47.020\nif I told you something,\nyou will fetch it, you will interpret it.\n\n194\n00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.900\nYou will execute it and then you will get\nit out so that it is stored somewhere.\n\n195\n00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.380\nIt might be stored in your brain or\nelsewhere or you might write it down.\n\n196\n00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.480\nSo that's a cycle.\n\n197\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.520\nSo that cycle basically happens very,\nvery fast as we like we said.\n\n198\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.980\nAnd, it is now important to\nstart imagining how does that\n\n199\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.040\nCPU actually look like?\n\n200\n00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.040\nRonnie I think you had some CPU,\nif I remember well.\n\n201\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.010\n>> We do, we have a couple of different\nunits here that we can take a look at.\n\n202\n00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.815\nBut let's go ahead and\nI've got an example of a CPU.\n\n203\n00:12:16.815 --> 00:12:19.900\nYou're not gonna be able to see it very\nwell but we'll at least show it to you.\n\n204\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.730\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at it right here.\n\n205\n00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:29.620\nNow, in my hand, this is an example\nof a CPU in which you see.\n\n206\n00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:34.220\nAnd it really is kind of embedded\ninside of some layers of silicon\n\n207\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.260\nas well as some ceramic and\nsome metals that you also end up seeing.\n\n208\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.460\nSo, inside of that is that\nprocessing unit that Dr.\n\n209\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.080\nAlmonso was telling us about as well.\n\n210\n00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.090\nAnd for us to be able to access it,\nwe have many of these different\n\n211\n00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.140\ngold pens that you see, it is a little\ndifficult, I think we will actually\n\n212\n00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.980\nshow an image of it in just a moment\ninstead, so that you can see that.\n\n213\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.740\nSo the more and\n\n214\n00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.990\nthe faster that this CPU can work, the\nmore that we're gonna end up seeing this.\n\n215\n00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.100\nSo, the material that you actually end up\nseeing that the CPU is embedded into is\n\n216\n00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.220\nwhat we'll call some\ntype of semi-conductor.\n\n217\n00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.810\nAnd because of it's very thin nature,\nit is like a wafer inside,\n\n218\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.090\na very microscopic wafer inside.\n\n219\n00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.050\nIt surrounds itself by this metal\ncomponent that we see right here on\n\n220\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.120\nthe top cover and\nthen some other ceramic material,\n\n221\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.080\nto ensure that we get\neverything that we need.\n\n222\n00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.270\nAnd then of course,\nthe way that we connect this into\n\n223\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.920\nthe system in which we would access to\ninteract with it are multiple tiny pins or\n\n224\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:37.123\npathways that we can get information\nin and out of this particular CPU here.\n\n225\n00:13:37.123 --> 00:13:37.775\nNow Dr. Tony,\n\n226\n00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:41.426\nI believe you actually have a detailed\npicture here, a little bit more.\n\n227\n00:13:41.426 --> 00:13:46.227\n>> Yeah, I managed to get a picture\nwhich now we are able blow up and\n\n228\n00:13:46.227 --> 00:13:48.867\nget to see how that CPU looks like.\n\n229\n00:13:48.867 --> 00:13:53.857\nSo Look, we're not trying to make\nyou an expert about CPUs and\n\n230\n00:13:53.857 --> 00:13:58.027\nthinking about transistors, and\nthinking about the buses and\n\n231\n00:13:58.027 --> 00:14:02.505\nhow data moves in there, but just to\nappreciate basically what we're talking\n\n232\n00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:06.543\nabout, every time maybe you open up a\ncomputer you can get to see what a CPU is.\n\n233\n00:14:06.543 --> 00:14:09.243\nIn any case, you can actually see,\nit's written over here,\n\n234\n00:14:09.243 --> 00:14:14.993\nCPU this is in the top side and this is\nmore like the bottom side and then we go.\n\n235\n00:14:14.993 --> 00:14:18.440\nAnd you'll get a few specifications\nabout the CPU written on it.\n\n236\n00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:23.830\nSometimes, you will get something like\nmine is written here, 3.80 gigahertz.\n\n237\n00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.160\nWe'll talk about that a little later.\n\n238\n00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.026\nThat's something that's specifically,\n\n239\n00:14:29.026 --> 00:14:32.800\ndescribes the capability\nof that particular CPU.\n\n240\n00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.540\nThat one that Ronnie showed\nis written 2.66 gigahertz.\n\n241\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.070\nAnd we'll get into more details\nabout some of those specifications.\n\n242\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.820\nSo that's about the CPU.\n\n243\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.400\nAnd from there,\nwe'll move onto something else.\n\n244\n00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:53.380\nAnd say, well,\nif I wanted to know how that performs,\n\n245\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:59.520\nthat CPU, we'll talk about the cycles.\n\n246\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.190\nWe spoke about cycles before.\n\n247\n00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.200\nSo the speed at which it can\nperform those kinda instructions,\n\n248\n00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.770\nis a measure of the capability of\nthat processor, CPU for that matter.\n\n249\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:15.001\nAnd it actually makes a significant\ndifference in terms of course.\n\n250\n00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:20.900\nCPU can make this but physically of course\nthey'll just look physically the same.\n\n251\n00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.400\nBut the capability of particular CPU\n\n252\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.950\ncan make a whole difference between\nthe cost of two particular computers.\n\n253\n00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.360\nIsn't that correct?\n\n254\n00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.620\n>> The cost is not only the major\ndifference here as well,\n\n255\n00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.350\neven though that's usually the main\ndecision difference that you and\n\n256\n00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:41.480\nI might choose, whether we choose a more\nexpensive one, or a less expensive one.\n\n257\n00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.750\nThat may actually be\nthe ultimate decision.\n\n258\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:49.597\nBut normally, the idea here of what we're\ntalking about in terms of the performance,\n\n259\n00:15:49.597 --> 00:15:52.012\nis that is the idea of performance.\n\n260\n00:15:52.012 --> 00:15:55.023\nWhen you hear those terms hertz and\ngigahertz, well,\n\n261\n00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:58.360\nthe idea of hertz is how many\nthings can be done in one cycle and\n\n262\n00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.568\nusually it's It's per second okay,\nwhen you talk about the idea of hertz.\n\n263\n00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:04.551\nBut when you talk about gigahertz,\n\n264\n00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:08.780\nthis is where you start talking\nabout billions of times per second.\n\n265\n00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.920\nNow when you start hearing those types of\nnumbers and everything that you hear, so\n\n266\n00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.906\nthe one that Dr. Tani just said on MiOS\n2.66 I believe, there is what we saw,\n\n267\n00:16:18.906 --> 00:16:21.965\nthere is 2.66 gigahertz.\n\n268\n00:16:21.965 --> 00:16:28.030\nThat's 2.6 or 2.7 billion cycles per\nsecond that it can run through and\n\n269\n00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.420\ndo some type of a process for me.\n\n270\n00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.220\nThat's a lot faster than my brain.\n\n271\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.330\nAt least I think my brain actually works.\n\n272\n00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.270\nAnd so when I think about that, that means\nthat this thing can actually do a lot more\n\n273\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.750\nthan I can at any one point in time.\n\n274\n00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.650\nNow the unusual thing is,\n\n275\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:49.480\nwe normally calculate the idea\nof speed with acceleration.\n\n276\n00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.310\nAnd that's where it's\na little bit different.\n\n277\n00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.740\nThe reason why this thing works faster is\nnot initially that it's faster in terms of\n\n278\n00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.490\nacceleration but\nit can handle more at one time.\n\n279\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.420\nSo when you hear somebody saying mine's so\nmuch faster and you might have bought\n\n280\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.340\na computer let's say, last year and\nthey just bought theirs this year.\n\n281\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.660\nYou might go it doesn't really feel any\nfaster, but in the background it's because\n\n282\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:18.335\nit can handle a lot more capacity and\nto do a lot more things at the same time.\n\n283\n00:17:18.335 --> 00:17:22.930\nDr. Tony, I normally relate this to cause\nI remember in college I had to peel\n\n284\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.790\npotatoes, peel potatoes for us to actually\nhave lunch and dinner and stuff like that.\n\n285\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.690\nWell, as one person, I might be able to\npeel say 60 potatoes in an hours time.\n\n286\n00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.030\nOkay, and that was working really fast.\n\n287\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:40.000\nBut if two more people came on and\nthey were able to peel 60 working\n\n288\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.760\nas a team well,\nthey got a 120 done versus my 60.\n\n289\n00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.590\nAnd that mean that with two people,\n\n290\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.650\nthey were able to actually\naccomplish twice as much as I was.\n\n291\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.870\nWell, in this sense that\nidea of the capacity is\n\n292\n00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:57.960\nalso the key in terms of gigahertz versus\nthe guy that does it alone, as well.\n\n293\n00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.600\nAnd so a lot of times these particular\nCPUs can have more than one core.\n\n294\n00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.200\nIn other words, more than one actual\nprocessing unit in them today.\n\n295\n00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.830\nAnd so you can accomplish\na lot more if it's faster and\n\n296\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.620\nthen there's also multiple cores in it.\n\n297\n00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.180\nSo it's very, it's not so much important\nthat we understand every bit of it.\n\n298\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.590\nBut it is neat technology and that's\nwhat you're hearing about when you start\n\n299\n00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:25.130\nhearing terms like i7 and AMD and\nthese newer processors that come out.\n\n300\n00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.130\nAnd if you wonder why they are so\n\n301\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.170\nexpensive, it is because they do\ntend to do a lot more capacity have\n\n302\n00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.940\na lot higher performance and of course\nwill also cost you a lot more money too.\n\n303\n00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.975\n>> True,\n\n304\n00:18:35.975 --> 00:18:40.930\nand that element of processing capacity\nis a decision that you have to make.\n\n305\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:46.490\nYou don't wanna buy a very expensive\ncomputer because you are told that\n\n306\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:51.270\nit has very high processing capacity and\nthat means I have a very powerful machine.\n\n307\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.730\nBut the question will be do you\nactually need all that power?\n\n308\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.600\nIf all you're gonna be doing\nis typing some documents or\n\n309\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.880\nWord documents, and\nyou're sending a few emails here and\n\n310\n00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.720\nthere, you're creating a report and\nplaying around with spreadsheets.\n\n311\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:11.640\nAnd then you end up buying very powerful\nprocessor, it's not that useful.\n\n312\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.960\nMaybe you could have used those resources\nfor something else, because And less\n\n313\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.740\npowerful processor which will do exactly\nwhat you wanna do and will be just fine.\n\n314\n00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.430\nSo as you make that kind\nof decision you think about\n\n315\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.180\nprocessing capacity because of all\nthe kinds of functions you wanna do.\n\n316\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:33.480\nIf you are trying to download a lot\nof stuff, compress things do a lot\n\n317\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.510\nof graphics kind of work then it requires\na lot of resources a lot of processing\n\n318\n00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:43.410\ncapacity, then it makes a lot of sense\nto increase the power of your computer.\n\n319\n00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.920\nAnd that's a decision that you\ncan actually make as you go\n\n320\n00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.500\nalong we'll talk about\nthe motherboard in a little while\n\n321\n00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.660\nwhich gives you a sense that you\ncan actually improve the memory.\n\n322\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.030\nThere's some things you can actually,\n\n323\n00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.500\nyou can actually change the processor\nof a computer, and things like that.\n\n324\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.130\nSo in other words you can do\nupgrades depending on the needs.\n\n325\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.950\nBecause you sometimes can buy a computer\nthat has a low processing capacity and\n\n326\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:10.500\nsomewhere along the way just discover it's\nnot working and it's kinda slowing down.\n\n327\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.420\nSo of course there's an issue of memory\nand there's a question of the processing\n\n328\n00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.000\ncapacity and all those things,\nthey'll be become clear as we get along.\n\n329\n00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.260\nSo we're gonna talk a little\nbit now about memory.\n\n330\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.700\nSo maybe you might remind me of a few\nthings that you were taught when\n\n331\n00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.545\nyou were in pre-unlit.\n\n332\n00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.290\nMaybe you can remember some.\n\n333\n00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.620\nMaybe you can't remember some.\n\n334\n00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.940\nAnd some of us are able to remember\nthings that happen recently and\n\n335\n00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.550\nothers within a few minutes say I don't\nseem to remember what exactly that was.\n\n336\n00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.930\nSometimes we remember things because\nwe are interested in those things and\n\n337\n00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:49.450\nsometimes maybe we forget about them\nbecause we are not interested in them.\n\n338\n00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.130\nSo really different things come into play.\n\n339\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.940\nAnd also the computer has similar kind\nof characteristics in a sense that\n\n340\n00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.540\nthere are things that need to\nbe stored for the long haul.\n\n341\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:05.000\nThere are things that need to be\nstored and can be released any time.\n\n342\n00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.460\nMaybe if the power goes off and\n\n343\n00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.080\nthen everything that was on\nthe computer is basically gone.\n\n344\n00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.630\nThere are some things that\nreally must never be erased,\n\n345\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.810\notherwise the computer\nwill never function.\n\n346\n00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.720\nSo there are different kinds of memory.\n\n347\n00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.870\nAnd so we can classify memory either\nas dynamic memory or static memory.\n\n348\n00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:31.020\nAnd as the name suggests, dynamic simply\nmeans, well, it will not be retained for\n\n349\n00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.200\nlong, for some reason, either power or\nwhatever it may be, or\n\n350\n00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.790\nthat you can actually move it,\nyou can delete it, and things like that.\n\n351\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:42.390\nAnd then, this is static memory that\ncan be retained without electricity\n\n352\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.780\nbeing constantly supplied\nas a second scenario.\n\n353\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.310\nAnd we can also classify memory\nas random access memory or\n\n354\n00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:54.390\nread only memory or erasable,\nprogrammable memory.\n\n355\n00:21:54.390 --> 00:22:01.050\nNow you'll hear some of those terms PROM,\ne-PROM, ee-PROM, things like that.\n\n356\n00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.910\nBut we're basically\ntalking about memory and\n\n357\n00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.890\ndifferent characteristics of that memory.\n\n358\n00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.477\nSo if it's a random access then it\nmeans we can easily access thing very\n\n359\n00:22:09.477 --> 00:22:11.199\nquickly and change them.\n\n360\n00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:15.179\nBut if it's read only memory\nthen it turns to well,\n\n361\n00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:20.283\ngenerally cannot rewrite or\noverwrite or delete it or change it.\n\n362\n00:22:20.283 --> 00:22:24.920\nIt's read, you can only read\nonly in any stuff it says.\n\n363\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.980\nSo we've this options and we're gonna try\nto demonstrate these three examples of\n\n364\n00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:36.050\nthis kind of memories on\nright our display space here.\n\n365\n00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.960\nSo you get a sense of what\nthis memory look like?\n\n366\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.700\nSo I will ask Ronnie who's\nreally an expert on this to\n\n367\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.730\nactually demonstrate an example of\na memory that is found on computer.\n\n368\n00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.150\nOf course,\nwe've got other forms of memory as well.\n\n369\n00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:58.240\n>> This particular piece that we're\nlooking at here is what we call a memory\n\n370\n00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.950\nmodule and lot of times you hear the term\nmemory stick or the stick of memory.\n\n371\n00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.160\nAnd each one of these components here,\neach one of these chips that you see,\n\n372\n00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.550\nallow us to store a certain\namount of information.\n\n373\n00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.330\nNow this type of memory though\nthat we have is the one that Dr.\n\n374\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:20.110\nOmwansa called that DRAM or\ndynamic random access memory,\n\n375\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:25.590\nwhich requires electricity to be present\nif it's to hold any of that data.\n\n376\n00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:30.590\nWhen the electricity is absent,\nthat particular pattern\n\n377\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:35.190\nof information that's stored on these\nchips will pretty much just disappear.\n\n378\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.330\nIt connects onto the motherboard\nthrough this edge of gold\n\n379\n00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.340\npins that we see right here.\n\n380\n00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:45.290\nAnd once we have something like that and\na lot of times the more chips that you\n\n381\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.546\nhave on a stick of RAM,\nthe more memory that you have available.\n\n382\n00:23:49.546 --> 00:23:55.340\nSo this one has it on both sides of\nthis circuit board that you see.\n\n383\n00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.840\nYou see it over on this side And you also\nsee it over here on this side as well.\n\n384\n00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.280\nRight here there's a sticker\nthat indicates the speed and\n\n385\n00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.630\nof course the amount of memory\nthat's actually on this module.\n\n386\n00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:12.840\nNow this particular stick of RAM\nthough is a bit older than what you\n\n387\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:18.580\nwould probably see in a modern computer\ntoday as of the recording of this episode.\n\n388\n00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.990\nBut, we do have one that's\na little bit faster here, and\n\n389\n00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:28.090\nall of a sudden you buy it and go,\nwell all of the chips have disappeared.\n\n390\n00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:33.050\nThere's no more chips on them on either\nside of this but this is not true.\n\n391\n00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:38.660\nThe newer RAM is now so fast and\ngenerates so much more heat,\n\n392\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.570\nthat they put a metal plate over\nthis to help dissipate the heat\n\n393\n00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:48.340\nfrom those chips on both\nsides a lot faster.\n\n394\n00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.970\nAnd so this particular one is\na more modern stick of memory,\n\n395\n00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.450\nthat actually gives you faster\naccess speeds and everything, and\n\n396\n00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.550\nof course even more capacity.\n\n397\n00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.760\nIf I remember correctly the earlier one\nthat I showed you here, the green one,\n\n398\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.750\nit says two Gigabytes\non the top of that one.\n\n399\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:10.050\nAnd then the one that I'm hold\ndown here in my other hand,\n\n400\n00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.580\nI think it actually says 16,\nif I remember right.\n\n401\n00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.960\nYeah, this one's actually 16,\nas I take a look at the label there.\n\n402\n00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.930\nSo this one holds a lot more, even though\nit's about physically the same size.\n\n403\n00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.900\nYou can see its almost physically the same\nsize here, it actually has more capacity.\n\n404\n00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:34.780\nAnd in today's world of computing,\nmore is actually better when you start\n\n405\n00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:39.590\ntalking about RAM, because it gives you\nthat ability to access it very quickly.\n\n406\n00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:43.340\nNow the other types of RAM that\nwe were talking about though,\n\n407\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.650\nwe can see some of that on\nthe actual motherboard.\n\n408\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.660\nI wanted to talk about\nthe motherboard a little more,\n\n409\n00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.240\nbut here's a great example of where you\ntend to see the idea of RAM being used.\n\n410\n00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.660\nYou can see where there's sticks of RAM\nright here inserted in, and over here is\n\n411\n00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.360\na bunch of slots that if we can upgrade,\nwe can add additional RAM into.\n\n412\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.570\nHere is some of that very\nspecial purposed RAM.\n\n413\n00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.890\nI'm trying to see if I can pull that\nup a little bit better cuz I'm getting\n\n414\n00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:13.280\na little bit blurry there, my fault.\n\n415\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.970\nHere's some special purpose type\nof memory that we also have.\n\n416\n00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.020\nAnd then along the motherboard there's a\nfew different chips that are actually just\n\n417\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:26.080\ninserted in here, that are actually\nrepresentations of that idea of that\n\n418\n00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.990\nstatic type of RAM as well.\n\n419\n00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:33.560\nSo all systems, all systems inside\nof your computer, they do work\n\n420\n00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.330\noff of the different types of memory\nthat you normally will end up seeing.\n\n421\n00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:42.030\nAnd so it just depends on what is needed\nat that particular moment as well.\n\n422\n00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.360\nAnd even on the CPU that we were just\nseeing, and here you can see one and\n\n423\n00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.850\nyou're probably saying,\nwhy is that all gray.\n\n424\n00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.770\nThat's because I took the heat sink off of\nit and it's got that thermal paste on it,\n\n425\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.040\nI didn't want to remove that yet.\n\n426\n00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.250\nSo, even what you see right here, even\ninside that there's actually even more\n\n427\n00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:03.680\nstatic memory, that's also just built\nin or baked into that chip as well.\n\n428\n00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.270\nSo there is a lot of memory that we\nactually have to deal with when we start\n\n429\n00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.700\nworking with different computing\nsystems around us as we start seeing.\n\n430\n00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.600\nNow, this type of memory that we're\ntalking about is found on just\n\n431\n00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.060\nabout every computer in\ndifferent capacities.\n\n432\n00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.840\nOnce again, the more money that you pay\nfor a computer system, more than likely,\n\n433\n00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.790\nyou actually end up getting more\nRAM on that system, as well.\n\n434\n00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.160\nAnd of course you can take\na look at the specifications for\n\n435\n00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.350\nthat system to find out.\n\n436\n00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.730\nSo just realize that you actually\nare normally seeing a lot, but\n\n437\n00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.560\nwhen they talk about system\nmemory in particular,\n\n438\n00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.830\nthat's those sticks of RAM\nthat we were showing you.\n\n439\n00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.670\nAnd the more that you have of that,\nthe faster your computer is\n\n440\n00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:48.000\nreally going to go, as you actually\nadd in more additional memory.\n\n441\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.280\nSo it's a great process or\na great tool for us to actually understand\n\n442\n00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.530\nthat memory is really kinda the way\nof where everything really begins.\n\n443\n00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:59.990\nAnd as far as computing goes,\nit's a great concept for\n\n444\n00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.260\nus to need to understand along\nwith the processing unit.\n\n445\n00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.126\n>> So we just spoke a little earlier about\nelectrically erasable programmable RAM.\n\n446\n00:28:09.126 --> 00:28:14.600\nRead Only memory, you know,\nbesides the kind of memory\n\n447\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:20.060\nthat we have talked about where, you know,\nit is mounted on to the motherboard and\n\n448\n00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:25.260\nconnected permanently there,\nwe've got ways also of manipulating and\n\n449\n00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.650\nworking with memory, you may have\nhad USB flash disk, flash drives.\n\n450\n00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.050\nYou may have had memory cards.\n\n451\n00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:37.270\nYou may have had solid-state hard\ndrives and things like that.\n\n452\n00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:43.199\nSo look it's just ways of having\nexternal memory that can be used\n\n453\n00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.750\nAnd it can be erased and we can replace.\n\n454\n00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:55.800\nIt's all using electronic means to update,\nto remove content and the like.\n\n455\n00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.790\nNow, my colleague, Ronny, actually went\nstraight into the mother board to explain\n\n456\n00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:03.580\na little bit about the mother board,\nby talking about memory at the same time.\n\n457\n00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.210\nSo I think we have another opportunity\nagain to go back through that motherboard\n\n458\n00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.310\nand think about, what about the other\nelements of that motherboard?\n\n459\n00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.440\nWhat is a motherboard?\n\n460\n00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.840\nWhy was it called mother?\n\n461\n00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.960\nAnd then,\nwhat do we see on that motherboard?\n\n462\n00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.730\nI have a picture right now on\nmy computer about motherboard,\n\n463\n00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.010\njust a simple motherboard.\n\n464\n00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.770\nIt's kinda similar to the one\nRonnie was displaying.\n\n465\n00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.860\nSo, you can see.\n\n466\n00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.760\nSometimes it looks like\na city from a distance.\n\n467\n00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.610\nLike I'm somewhere in a plane,\nand I'm looking down and\n\n468\n00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.170\nseeing something like a city.\n\n469\n00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:41.600\nIt has buildings.\n\n470\n00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.700\nIt has small and big and\ndifferent types, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n471\n00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.810\nSo I'll ask Ronnie to lift\nagain the physical one and\n\n472\n00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.890\njust give us a snapshot of what\nexactly is on that motherboard.\n\n473\n00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.100\n>> All right, so when we start talking\nabout the idea of the motherboard here.\n\n474\n00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.600\nLet me see if I can hold it\nsteady a little bit more,\n\n475\n00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.660\nit is because everything plugs\ndirectly into this board.\n\n476\n00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.570\nWhether we're talking about input\ndevices that we've already mentioned in\n\n477\n00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.170\nthe previous episode or output devices.\n\n478\n00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.980\nWhether we're talking about hard drives,\nother types of permanent memory storage.\n\n479\n00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.220\nOr whether we're talking about anything\nelse if we wanted to interact with\n\n480\n00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:23.410\nthe CPU itself,\nit has to go through this mother board.\n\n481\n00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:28.570\nThe reason why is that the motherboard\nprovides us physical pathways to the CPU\n\n482\n00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.160\nand also allows that data to be processed.\n\n483\n00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:36.270\nEvery stick of RAM actually connects in,\nevery component like we were just talking.\n\n484\n00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.450\nLet me see if I can flip this over so\nthat we can see a little bit better.\n\n485\n00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.080\nEverything that we can plug in\nusing a cable would actually use\n\n486\n00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.500\nany of these ports that you see right\nhere that are actually available to you.\n\n487\n00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.820\nSo that you can connect them and\n\n488\n00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:54.530\nhave the processing power of the computer\ninteract with those devices as well.\n\n489\n00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:59.590\nNow, along with that of course,\nyes you have this one is a little bit more\n\n490\n00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:03.160\nhefty in some of the things that it has\nIt actually has a lot of connections.\n\n491\n00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:08.270\nThis one can hold, it likes up to ten\nadditional hard drives Dr. Omonzo.\n\n492\n00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.070\nSo this mother board is pretty,\nis pretty hefty mother board.\n\n493\n00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:14.960\nIt's a high performance type of\nmother board that we do see here\n\n494\n00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.660\nthat allows us to have\nthat information as well.\n\n495\n00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.580\nNow, when you start taking\na look at the basic layout\n\n496\n00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:27.550\nis of course we have the CPU here, and\nclosest to the CPU is gonna be the RAM.\n\n497\n00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.230\nThat's because these\nare the highest speed components\n\n498\n00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.130\nthat we have on the motherboard.\n\n499\n00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:36.772\nAs we start moving toward the peripheral\nedge here, these devices of course\n\n500\n00:31:36.772 --> 00:31:40.481\nstart getting a little bit slower and\nslower as you move out.\n\n501\n00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:43.777\nNow one of the ones\nthat's very difficult for\n\n502\n00:31:43.777 --> 00:31:49.610\nus to see Is that the motherboard only\nhas so much capabilities that it can do.\n\n503\n00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:53.507\nNot capacity, but actually I guess\na limitation in capacity as well.\n\n504\n00:31:53.507 --> 00:31:56.771\nBut you actually see these slots here,\nI'm pointing my finger directly on them.\n\n505\n00:31:56.771 --> 00:32:00.251\nSome of them are shorter than others and\nI'm trying to see if I can,\n\n506\n00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:01.557\nyeah they're black, so\n\n507\n00:32:01.557 --> 00:32:06.200\nthey don't actually show up on the black\nbackground very well in our picture here.\n\n508\n00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:11.600\nThese, these, these, and this here,\nthose are what we call expansion slots.\n\n509\n00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.640\nAnd they give me the ability to add in\nadditional circuitry, additional circuit\n\n510\n00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.850\nboards that may also have their own memory\nand even their own processing unit,\n\n511\n00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:25.960\nto extend the capabilities of what\nthis motherboard can also do as well.\n\n512\n00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.820\nSo this particular motherboard, and\n\n513\n00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.700\nactually most motherboards\nat least give you one or\n\n514\n00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.520\ntwo of these expansion slots, but you can\nadd in additional capabilities as well.\n\n515\n00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.720\nAnd even modify and\nchange the amount of RAM.\n\n516\n00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.730\nThis one is, again,\na high performance one,\n\n517\n00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:45.609\nthe very fact that there's\nactually eight slots for that RAM.\n\n518\n00:32:45.609 --> 00:32:49.550\nAnd so I can have up to I\n\n519\n00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:53.750\nthink 128 gigabytes of RAM on this\none motherboard if I chose to.\n\n520\n00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.250\nI don't have that much money,\n\n521\n00:32:55.250 --> 00:33:00.150\nbut this is what you actually\nhave to ability to see and do.\n\n522\n00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.320\nNow, one of the more important concepts\nwhich we'll also get into later,\n\n523\n00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.630\nit also of course has a plug\nover here on this side and\n\n524\n00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.320\nthere's about 20 pins in it or\nI think 24 pins, excuse me.\n\n525\n00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.040\nCan't really count that well.\n\n526\n00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.450\nOver here where my thumb is,\nthat actually allows me to put, well,\n\n527\n00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:17.560\npower to it, right.\n\n528\n00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.110\nElectrical power is also\nwhat we need as well.\n\n529\n00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:24.360\nSo there's a lot of different interfaces,\na lot of different components here.\n\n530\n00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:31.040\nAnd as you buy computers that have more\nadditional components, well if you want\n\n531\n00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.550\none that's actually completely expandable,\nyou're gonna pay more money for it, again.\n\n532\n00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.730\nSo it's one of the limitations,\n\n533\n00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:40.000\nif you're willing to spend money\nyou can get one like this too.\n\n534\n00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.949\nYep.\n>> Well,\n\n535\n00:33:40.949 --> 00:33:43.698\nwhen I am rich enough\nI am gonna come over.\n\n536\n00:33:43.698 --> 00:33:48.755\n[LAUGH] [COUGH] We just Just,\nRonny, you just spoke about power,\n\n537\n00:33:48.755 --> 00:33:53.835\na few just seconds ago, less than a minute\nago you spoke about power supply.\n\n538\n00:33:53.835 --> 00:33:57.205\nAnd well that simply tells me that\nyou've got to power computers and\n\n539\n00:33:57.205 --> 00:34:01.655\nthat's as far as I can recall\nis that the power that we get\n\n540\n00:34:01.655 --> 00:34:05.730\nfrom the supply is normally AC,\nis that correct?\n\n541\n00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.470\nAnd then did I just learn that\ninternally the computer operates on DC?\n\n542\n00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.800\nSo could you just take us through that?\n\n543\n00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.290\nBecause I can see you've got a very\nnice power supply device here.\n\n544\n00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:22.560\nI know that we also have it on computer,\nbut maybe you can take us through this\n\n545\n00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.810\npower supply and\nhow it connects to the computer.\n\n546\n00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.930\n>> Definitely will be able to do that.\n\n547\n00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:31.384\nSo from whatever your outlet is, from\nwherever you are in the world, it will of\n\n548\n00:34:31.384 --> 00:34:35.719\ncourse have an external connection to\nwherever your power's supplied to.\n\n549\n00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:40.065\nNow you do have to be careful about\nthis worldwide wherever you are,\n\n550\n00:34:40.065 --> 00:34:45.265\nbecause like here in the United States\nwe run off of the 110 or 120 voltage.\n\n551\n00:34:45.265 --> 00:34:49.370\nWhereas outside the United States\nyou might actually run on, 220, 240?\n\n552\n00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:53.490\n240 is what Dr. Ohmazo is telling, 240.\n\n553\n00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:58.240\nWell, some power supplies can handle\nthat but some cannot automatically.\n\n554\n00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.690\nSo sometimes you might see where there's\na little switch that allows you to switch\n\n555\n00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:06.850\nthat, so that you actually make sure that\nyou see the number that's actually for\n\n556\n00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:07.810\nwhere you are.\n\n557\n00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.390\nIf you plug it in to the wrong one,\nit's not gonna work or\n\n558\n00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:12.090\nit's gonna explode on you.\n\n559\n00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:16.250\nThat's a very real warning so\nbe careful in doing that.\n\n560\n00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.580\nThe great thing is, the plugs are now so\ndifferent, you can't\n\n561\n00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:24.460\nreally interchange them very easily unless\nyou are trying to do it on purpose.\n\n562\n00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.090\nBut overall though that's what\nyou'll also end up seeing.\n\n563\n00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.250\nSo a lot of times it should\ntell you right on the label\n\n564\n00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:35.680\nwhich one this is designed for,\nif it's not what they call auto-switching.\n\n565\n00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.420\nSo the label, which you can't\nreally see cuz of the glare that\n\n566\n00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.470\nI'm trying to hold it up to an angle but\n\n567\n00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.810\nit's not gonna let me do it, it normally\nactually tells us several things.\n\n568\n00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:48.150\nSo as I get power coming in on one side,\nover here is AC power,\n\n569\n00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.580\nalternating current.\n\n570\n00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.440\nBut when it comes out on the other\nside through this bundle of cables,\n\n571\n00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.750\nit comes out as DC or direct current.\n\n572\n00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.190\nNow if you're not familiar with that,\n\n573\n00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:03.090\nthink about the idea of batteries,\nbatteries are essentially DC current.\n\n574\n00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.160\nSo we have electrical\noutlet from our wall and\n\n575\n00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.120\nyou know provided by the power stations\nthat are out there and then we can plug\n\n576\n00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:15.730\nthis into individual components\ninside of the computers to power up.\n\n577\n00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:18.760\nAnd then we have one more\nconnection on this one,\n\n578\n00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.000\nwhich powers the motherboard itself, and\nthat's the key that we want to get to.\n\n579\n00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.800\nSo here's what supplies all of the actual\navailable power to the motherboard itself.\n\n580\n00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.630\nAnd then we have of course peripherals\n\n581\n00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:36.900\nthat will also get supplied their\nproper amount of voltage as well.\n\n582\n00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.140\nNormally inside every component\nwill actually require a little bit\n\n583\n00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.260\nof different power.\n\n584\n00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.880\nSo there's normally three,\nthere's 3.3 volts, 12 volts, and\n\n585\n00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.020\n5 volts, depending on what's needed.\n\n586\n00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.470\nAnd this particular unit actually supplies\n\n587\n00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.090\nall of them actually as I\nstart seeing the colors.\n\n588\n00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:55.240\nSo each of the colors does\nrepresent different things\n\n589\n00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.230\nsuch as the voltage that's\nactually going through them.\n\n590\n00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.060\nAnd you see that this actually\nhas multiple colors on them\n\n591\n00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.380\nsupplying different voltage as well.\n\n592\n00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:08.270\nSo you always need one of these and there\nwill always be one inside of your computer\n\n593\n00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:11.300\nthat will help power\neverything inside of it.\n\n594\n00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:15.480\nThe only think that you worry\nabout here is the capacity.\n\n595\n00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.310\nDoes it actually power everything up?\n\n596\n00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.600\nIf you can turn on everything\ninside of your computer,\n\n597\n00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.740\nit probably is designed to\nhold that particular capacity.\n\n598\n00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.100\nIf you start adding in multiple components\nyou may see that you need to actually\n\n599\n00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:31.380\nsupply a bit more of what we call wattage\nat that point to actually do that and\n\n600\n00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.960\nto supply all the power necessary now,\nwith your computer and\n\n601\n00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.450\nof course additional\nthings that you added in.\n\n602\n00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:40.320\nSo right here is just a basic one.\n\n603\n00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.660\nIt really helps, you can get these where\nit actually supplies up to a kilowatt or\n\n604\n00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:50.680\nmore power, in a single power supply,\nthat's about as much as a refrigerator.\n\n605\n00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.230\nSo it's amazing about what\nyou can actually do and\n\n606\n00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:59.100\nyour computer can take up as much\nelectricity as a refrigerator running.\n\n607\n00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.660\nYou do need to be careful because I\ncan drive up your electrical bill\n\n608\n00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.258\nvery quickly.\n\n609\n00:38:03.258 --> 00:38:05.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> Very quickly, that's absolutely true.\n\n610\n00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:10.797\nI think we've learned something about\npower supply, and the one that I call it\n\n611\n00:38:10.797 --> 00:38:15.910\nRonnie demonstrated is one for passing\na computer that you use on your desk.\n\n612\n00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:22.090\nLaptops will have a slightly different\none, mobile phone will have a slightly\n\n613\n00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.900\ndifferent one,\ntablet will have a slightly different one.\n\n614\n00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.680\nOf course,\nphysically smaller as you go all the way.\n\n615\n00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.710\nKeep in mind that the purpose of that\npower supply is to convert DC to AC.\n\n616\n00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:37.080\nAnd also to decrease the voltage so\n\n617\n00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.040\nthat it is supplied to\na different point it is to\n\n618\n00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.980\ndifferent devices within the motherboard\nand the general computer, generally.\n\n619\n00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:50.730\nAnd I think Ronny made a very,\nvery important remark earlier on that you\n\n620\n00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:55.680\nhave to know what is a power supply\nfrom the wall or from whatever supply\n\n621\n00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.260\nyou're getting it and whether it\nwill actually solve the purpose.\n\n622\n00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.800\nI have had that particular experience,\nI bought a very nice device,\n\n623\n00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.027\nI don't wanna tell you what it was.\n\n624\n00:39:05.027 --> 00:39:06.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was very excited,\n\n625\n00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.600\nI traveled somewhere and\nbought it and went back home.\n\n626\n00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.860\nI'm like yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n627\n00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.650\nnow I have some very nice device that\nwill sort out some of my problems.\n\n628\n00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:17.270\nI plugged it in without\nthinking to much and\n\n629\n00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:21.320\nthe rest is history,\ndead in a matter of seconds.\n\n630\n00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:27.210\nI just saw smoke and it was a very sad\npossum there after, so be careful.\n\n631\n00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.520\nDon't repeat someone's mistakes as well.\n\n632\n00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.230\nWe share mistakes so\nthat we can get better.\n\n633\n00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:36.040\nThe last thing we wanna talk about,\nsometimes your computer doesn't\n\n634\n00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.600\nit just misbehaves, it kind of hums or\nit just stops working.\n\n635\n00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.627\nSo we've got something\nwe call troubleshooting.\n\n636\n00:39:43.627 --> 00:39:46.891\nAnd we have different things that\ncan happen to a computer and\n\n637\n00:39:46.891 --> 00:39:49.899\nyou need to have a sense of\nthe basic things you could do,\n\n638\n00:39:49.899 --> 00:39:54.059\nso you don't immediately have to call\nan expert and say, call an engineer and\n\n639\n00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:58.520\nsay I want to return back this\ncomputer because it's not functioning.\n\n640\n00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.620\nIt's possibly something\nthat could possibly solve.\n\n641\n00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:05.347\nSometimes you see scenarios where\nthe computer doesn't respond,\n\n642\n00:40:05.347 --> 00:40:07.580\nit has just gone quiet.\n\n643\n00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.813\nSometimes maybe you're working on it and\nyou can see things on the screen and\n\n644\n00:40:11.813 --> 00:40:13.870\nthen the mouse is not moving.\n\n645\n00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:18.570\nOr you just see the mouse, the cursor is\njust moving on the screen for a while and\n\n646\n00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.009\nyou don't see anything happen to it.\n\n647\n00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:24.020\nAnd you wonder what exactly,\nwhat's going on.\n\n648\n00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.210\nSo there are many, many, sometimes you\ncan hear some sound, or you'll probably\n\n649\n00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:32.000\nhear the fan running but then you're\nnot seeing anything on the screen, or\n\n650\n00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.710\nyou can just see an error\nmessage on the screen.\n\n651\n00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:40.790\nSo, look, just like the normal human body,\nsometimes we respond to certain things.\n\n652\n00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:47.080\nSo not everything that is uncommon on\na computer means that it is broken.\n\n653\n00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:53.070\nYou can actually fix it, and you can have\nthe courage to actually fix it, just\n\n654\n00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:58.430\ndo very specific things on the computer\nto get them back to its normal function.\n\n655\n00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:01.250\nI'll give you a very good example,\nand it's really funny.\n\n656\n00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:06.950\nA friend of mine bought a computer and\nwent to the house and mounted it.\n\n657\n00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.420\nAnd then there was nothing\ndisplaying on the screen.\n\n658\n00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.900\nHe really wanted that, I just bought\nthis computer a few seconds ago.\n\n659\n00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.910\nHe knew exactly what was happening here.\n\n660\n00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:19.170\nSo he called the sales rep of the company\nthat he bought the computer, and\n\n661\n00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.500\nhe said the computer is not working.\n\n662\n00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.060\nYou probably sold me a bad computer.\n\n663\n00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.560\nAnd then the salesman says well look,\nlet's step by step,\n\n664\n00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.620\nlet's see what exactly happened.\n\n665\n00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.860\nCan you turn on the computer?\n\n666\n00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.200\nI said yeah,\nI'm turning it on nothing happens.\n\n667\n00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.910\nOkay fine, let's see.\n\n668\n00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:35.940\nDid you connect all the power cords right?\n\n669\n00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.030\nYes, nothing happens.\n\n670\n00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.450\nCan you press again, turn it on.\n\n671\n00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:39.378\nNothing happens.\n\n672\n00:41:39.378 --> 00:41:42.117\nOkay, fine, go and look at the socket,\n\n673\n00:41:42.117 --> 00:41:46.564\ndid you actually switch on the computer,\ndid you turn the power?\n\n674\n00:41:46.564 --> 00:41:50.106\nBecause we are in a context where you must\nswitch on the power supplies, and yes,\n\n675\n00:41:50.106 --> 00:41:53.190\nyes, and nothing is happening,\nI can't even see anything.\n\n676\n00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:56.380\nAll right, fine, can you make sure that\nall the cords are connected properly,\n\n677\n00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.810\nsaid, well I can't see.\n\n678\n00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.332\nAnd he goes why can't you see?\n\n679\n00:41:59.332 --> 00:42:01.357\nThere's no electricity.\n\n680\n00:42:01.357 --> 00:42:02.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n681\n00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.900\nif there was no power than the computer\nwasn't going to work, all right.\n\n682\n00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.580\nSo and then of course the sale's\nperson's a bit disappointed having\n\n683\n00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.240\ntaken through all that whole process.\n\n684\n00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.820\nSo Ronnie, I think is going to\nconclude around things like,\n\n685\n00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:22.410\nsometimes when the computer is not\nresponding, you can restart a computer.\n\n686\n00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:25.560\nThat's a very common way\nof diagnosing a simple\n\n687\n00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.680\nissue where the computer is not\nfunctioning as you expected.\n\n688\n00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.650\nSo you can actually go ahead and\npress the start button off,\n\n689\n00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:37.480\nthe power start button of the computer,\nfor some seconds and then it will\n\n690\n00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.740\nautomatically go off, then you can press\nit again, and then it'll come back on.\n\n691\n00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.290\nThat's a simple diagnosis,\n\n692\n00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:47.660\nwhat basically happens is that sometimes\nthings move in the computer, data moves,\n\n693\n00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.694\nand then it kind of gets confused a little\nbit and you just have to restart it fresh.\n\n694\n00:42:51.694 --> 00:42:56.230\nSometimes your power cords\nare not properly connected and\n\n695\n00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:00.220\nthen you have to squeeze and\njust making sure that they were connected.\n\n696\n00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:05.140\nSometimes when you move a PC up and down\nmaybe did gets a little loose, the cord\n\n697\n00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.780\ngets a little loose, even a laptop for\nthat matter got a little loose and\n\n698\n00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:13.550\nthen you like it seems like it’s running\nout of power or its not charging properly.\n\n699\n00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:17.590\nSo, the some of these basic things\nthat you could possibly do that make\n\n700\n00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.070\nsure their computer keeps running.\n\n701\n00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:25.482\nSometimes, when you connect a computer to\nthe Internet, it gets to upgrade itself.\n\n702\n00:43:25.482 --> 00:43:30.576\nSometimes the operating system has been\ninstalled over there needs upgrades, and\n\n703\n00:43:30.576 --> 00:43:35.900\nautomatically out of connection to\nthe Internet it's now starting to upgrade.\n\n704\n00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:40.150\nThat's normal, so I need to give you some\ninstructions on your screen saying here\n\n705\n00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.969\ngive us a few minutes, give me a few\nminutes and you get back to myself and so\n\n706\n00:43:43.969 --> 00:43:46.578\nyou'll be patient don't\nrestart the computer.\n\n707\n00:43:46.578 --> 00:43:50.971\nBecause sometimes you can get it confused\nfarther, so you give it time to come\n\n708\n00:43:50.971 --> 00:43:55.375\nback on and then it will probably restart\nby itself and then go back to normal.\n\n709\n00:43:55.375 --> 00:44:00.751\nI don't know, I believe that you have\nhad some experiences troubleshooting\n\n710\n00:44:00.751 --> 00:44:05.790\nthe basic issues of a computer so\nthat it get backs to normal.\n\n711\n00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:10.770\n>> As you begin, if you're working with\ncomputers as a career opening maybe,\n\n712\n00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:15.420\nyou wanna always follow the instructions\nthat you have on hand here.\n\n713\n00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.310\nSo a lot of times a company will tell you\nexactly how you need to troubleshoot,\n\n714\n00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.410\nmake sure you follow those instructions.\n\n715\n00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.430\nBut in absence of instructions,\n\n716\n00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:26.100\nalways follow the simple\nthings that really matter.\n\n717\n00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:30.590\nVerify that you have the power that you\nneed first, verify that the connections\n\n718\n00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:34.560\nare good, verify that you can see\nwhat you're expecting to see.\n\n719\n00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.320\nAny of those that you can't, normally\nis gonna be a power related issue.\n\n720\n00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.530\nBut if you're seeing stuff and\n\n721\n00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:44.690\nit's still not responding,\nthat may be a software-related issue.\n\n722\n00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:47.200\nSo, the goal here,\nof course, is to isolate and\n\n723\n00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.740\nthen begin the process of troubleshooting.\n\n724\n00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.560\nVerify whether it's a hardware-related\nissue or a software-related issue, and\n\n725\n00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.970\nthen you can work from that point.\n\n726\n00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:59.540\nNow, we're not going in in-depth into any\none particular issue of troubleshooting\n\n727\n00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:04.130\nhere, but what you wanna do is follow\nthe same process all the way though.\n\n728\n00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:07.210\nDon't fix one thing and then go,\nI don't think it's that, and fix another.\n\n729\n00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.650\nIf you fix one thing and\n\n730\n00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:13.160\nit doesn't work, set it back to the way\nit originally was and then fix another.\n\n731\n00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.760\nSo always work on only one\nproblem at a time, is my key,\n\n732\n00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.590\nuntil you actually get\nto the right problem.\n\n733\n00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:19.810\nIs it a longer process?\n\n734\n00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:21.870\nYes, but is it the right process?\n\n735\n00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:25.418\nIt definitely is, so make sure you take\nthat into account when you think about it.\n\n736\n00:45:25.418 --> 00:45:29.770\nAll right, Dr. Omwansa,\nany last words here on the system unit?\n\n737\n00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.530\n>> This is an electronic device,\nit is not a mechanical device.\n\n738\n00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.840\nIt may have mechanical features\non there but it's an electrical,\n\n739\n00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.709\nan electronic device, it's delicate\nyou're gonna take care of it.\n\n740\n00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.950\nIt can function with\nbasic instructions and\n\n741\n00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:50.020\nyou can use a computer for many, many\nyears, it's never brought up any problem.\n\n742\n00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:53.780\nBut it's always good to have\na technician within reach,\n\n743\n00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.060\nin the event you have a little\nmore technical problems.\n\n744\n00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.270\nWhenever you need to make\na patches of a computer,\n\n745\n00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:03.880\nyou need to think about processing\ncapacity and things like that.\n\n746\n00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.850\nTalk to an expert, mention some of\nyour expectations in terms of what\n\n747\n00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.750\nare your needs, what exactly\nare you going to use it for, so\n\n748\n00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:14.790\nthey can gauge you as to which kind\nof computer you want to purchase.\n\n749\n00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:18.870\nSo that you don't spend too much money for\na computer that,\n\n750\n00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:24.720\nyou wouldn't be able to use all\nthe resources that it's got.\n\n751\n00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.110\nSo the solutions are out there,\nthere are technical experts but\n\n752\n00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:32.060\nit is important for you to have a rough\nidea basically what is it that you want.\n\n753\n00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.770\nWhen are you gonna use your computer for\nand\n\n754\n00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:39.758\nalso to maintain it because it's a\ndelicate device, it's an expensive device.\n\n755\n00:46:39.758 --> 00:46:44.150\nBut it's also powerful, so\nyou want to keep it working properly for\n\n756\n00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.560\na long time so that it serves you better.\n\n757\n00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.140\nOf course we all know that\nas a digital device or\n\n758\n00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:54.230\nan electronic device,\nit has mechanical elements.\n\n759\n00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:58.770\nAfter some time, it will not function\nas it was functioning when it's new,\n\n760\n00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:02.870\njust like a car, just like a bicycle and\nit needs a bit of maintenance.\n\n761\n00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:05.480\nSo sometimes you have to\nblow some dust out of it,\n\n762\n00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.040\nsometimes you have to change a cord.\n\n763\n00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.910\nBut then as time goes by\nit kind of depreciates, so\n\n764\n00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:16.090\nyou wouldn't have it with\nthe same capability over time.\n\n765\n00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:20.360\nAnd it's important in time you know you\nhave to replace it, and that's expected.\n\n766\n00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:25.090\nSo I hope with this foundation\nknowledge about the system\n\n767\n00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.580\nunit that has several components together.\n\n768\n00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:32.650\nYou feel a little more confident to\nmake a few decisions and also to engage\n\n769\n00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:37.180\nwith others about the computer, that you\neither want or you want to get rid of.\n\n770\n00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:39.172\n>> All right, well Dr.\n\n771\n00:47:39.172 --> 00:47:43.510\nTonny, thank you again for introducing\nus to the basics of that system unit and\n\n772\n00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:48.230\nallowing us to take a look inside and\nsee the overall relationship of those\n\n773\n00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:53.080\ncomponents and how they do begin\nto at

00:00:16.810\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.990\nyou're watching the Computing Fundamentals\nIC3 Show, where we are about to take\n\n5\n00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.180\na look at input,\noutput in different storage devices.\n\n6\n00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.290\nThere's a lot of options out there and who\nbetter to help us understand some of these\n\n7\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.798\noptions and some of these different\ndevices than Dr. Tonny Omwansa.\n\n8\n00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.560\nDr. Omwansa, welcome back to our studio.\n\n9\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.730\n>> Thank you very much for having me here.\n\n10\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.050\nWe spend a lot of time studying, thinking\nthrough these computer environment,\n\n11\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.690\nand the opportunity to\ntalk about input and\n\n12\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.390\noutput devices as well\nstorage is exciting.\n\n13\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.690\nBecause we're gonna need them on a day to\nday basis as we work with our computers.\n\n14\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.020\n>> There is no doubt that what we have\nhere of course is, well, a plethora.\n\n15\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.040\nWe actually have a lot of choices that\nwe can make in terms of input and\n\n16\n00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.300\noutput devices.\n\n17\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.680\nAnd each time that we\nactually use a different one,\n\n18\n00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.800\nit actually presents us\ndifferent challenges.\n\n19\n00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.450\nBut you do need to know that there are\nseveral of them out there that can help us\n\n20\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.950\nto accomplish the same things.\n\n21\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520\nAnd some of them really do help\nus to accomplish things that\n\n22\n00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.290\nwe might not be able to accomplish\nwith one of those tools,\n\n23\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.450\nwhere another one might\nactually be easier.\n\n24\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.631\nSo where are we gonna begin today,\nDr. Omwansa?\n\n25\n00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:21.670\n>> I think the best place to begin\nis to try and understand that there\n\n26\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.110\nis a variety of inputs,\noutput, and storage devices.\n\n27\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.770\nAnd then we'll try to figure out,\nhow do you select,\n\n28\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.586\nwhat would you possibly use for what\nkind of inputs and what kind of outputs?\n\n29\n00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:39.960\nAnd then think about what\nkind of storage device\n\n30\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.620\nwould be appropriate for you to choose for\nwhatever kind of thing you want to store.\n\n31\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.470\nSo it's about understanding the types and\nthen try to figure it out how do you make\n\n32\n00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.090\na choice, how do you make\na decision between what input,\n\n33\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.300\nwhat output, and what storage device?\n\n34\n00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.300\n>> And so Dr. Tonny,\nwhat are we gonna start off with?\n\n35\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.950\nI know that probably the input\ndevice that's just about on every\n\n36\n00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.330\nsingle computer, whether it's\na actually a physical device or\n\n37\n00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.310\nwhether it's virtually on the screen\nthat we can touch, is a keyboard.\n\n38\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.570\nSo what do we need to understand here?\n\n39\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.390\n>> Well this is a lot to think about and\nreflect on about keyboards.\n\n40\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.230\nBut the best talking point about\nkeyboard is to appreciate that\n\n41\n00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.435\nit's a board of keys.\n\n42\n00:02:21.435 --> 00:02:25.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it's got several keys and\n\n43\n00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.720\nthe different key have\ndifferent functions.\n\n44\n00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.230\nThe physical keyboards,\nelectronic keyboards and\n\n45\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.340\nwe're gonna go through one step at a time,\n\n46\n00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.590\ntrying to demonstrate some examples\nin there and some of the features.\n\n47\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.870\nSo, our starting point is the QWERTY\nkeyboard which those characters,\n\n48\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.950\njust Q-W-E-R-T-Y are exactly\nthe characters of the keyboard.\n\n49\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.190\nYou know, right up to the end\nwe'll demonstrate exactly\n\n50\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.470\nhow did we arrive at that kind of a name?\n\n51\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.180\nIt's just a collection of the specific\ncharacters that we just mentioned and\n\n52\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.810\nI don't know if it can be seen on\nthe keyboard, yeah, there you go.\n\n53\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.562\nSo over here we have Q W E R T Y so\nwe can all it qwerty or qwerty,\n\n54\n00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:12.316\nsome people depending on how\nyou're gonna pronounce it but\n\n55\n00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:16.042\nthis is the first place\nto start as a keyboard.\n\n56\n00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:20.355\nIt's got set of functions,\nthe keys up here,\n\n57\n00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:24.785\nfunction keys, which range from F1 to F12.\n\n58\n00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:29.972\nAnd then we've got toggle keys, those are\nthe ones that normally turn on and off.\n\n59\n00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:33.181\nYou can see the cap\nkeys when you press it,\n\n60\n00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:37.480\nit's gonna make the characters\nto be in uppercase.\n\n61\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.900\nThere are modifier keys like a Shift key,\nwhen press a Shift key and\n\n62\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.970\npress something else,\nit modifies what that key is able to do.\n\n63\n00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.740\nThink about the Ctrl,\nwe've talking about Ctrl+C or Ctrl+X,\n\n64\n00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.520\nwhich we use to cut, or Control+Z, which\nis to undo, Control+V, which is to paste.\n\n65\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.120\nThere are so\n\n66\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.420\nmany other combinations that you can\ncreate which can do different things,\n\n67\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.570\nassuming you're working in something like\nMicrosoft Word or Excel or whatever.\n\n68\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.540\nSo it depends on how\nproficient you become.\n\n69\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.660\nNow this keyboard can be either connected\n\n70\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.590\nthrough some wire here and through USB,\nso you can connect to the computer.\n\n71\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.305\nOr it can be wireless as well and it's\npossible then to work with this keyboard\n\n72\n00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:34.115\nwithout having to connect it\nphysically to a computer.\n\n73\n00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:39.925\nThere are other keyboards that\nhave emerged over time like these\n\n74\n00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:44.535\nergonomic keyboard which has been\ndesigned to make it a little easier.\n\n75\n00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:47.170\nAnd I'm displaying it\nright now on my computer\n\n76\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.040\nwhich some is a little more flexible so\nyour hands can move around a little bit.\n\n77\n00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.240\nSo it's enable so\n\n78\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.220\nit's not kind of straight, sometimes\nyour hands can get uncomfortable.\n\n79\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.523\nSo the keyboard has been designed to make\nit a little more flexible and easy to use.\n\n80\n00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:10.516\nAnd it's and it could be a keyboard can\nactually be physical or electronic.\n\n81\n00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:15.155\nSo in some cases now, we've got\nkeyboards that are purely electronic\n\n82\n00:05:15.155 --> 00:05:18.560\nwhere you press a button and\na keyboard shows up.\n\n83\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.570\nSo it's not a physical keyboard per se,\nso all those options are there.\n\n84\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.800\nAnd you can actually have a device\nthat has an electronic keyboard but\n\n85\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.070\nyou can still connect a physical\nkeyboard to that particular device and\n\n86\n00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.640\nthen use it eternally.\n\n87\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.550\nAnd so\nI've seen some people with a laptop, and\n\n88\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.800\nthe laptop has a keyboard really which\nis mounted permanently on the keyboard.\n\n89\n00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.340\nBut then again you find them\nusing a keyboard connected\n\n90\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.970\nphysically to that computer.\n\n91\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.910\nJust because they're more\ncomfortable working that way or\n\n92\n00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.680\nsometimes the keyboard of\nthe laptop is not functional.\n\n93\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.130\nSo, that's a good place to start\nthinking about keyboards because\n\n94\n00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.910\nsomehow we get to use keyboards.\n\n95\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.430\nAnd the keyboards ideally\n\n96\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.110\nany electronic device that we get\nto has some form of a keyboard.\n\n97\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.419\nSo, it could be a mobile phones,\nso like a smartphone over here.\n\n98\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.610\nIf I wanted to type something, probably\nI'm going somewhere and I'm trying to say,\n\n99\n00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.830\nwell, I'm gonna type something, then\nautomatically a keyboard comes into place.\n\n100\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.429\nCuz that's the easiest\nway to type text and\n\n101\n00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:28.640\nalphanumeric content into a computer.\n\n102\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.870\nSo I wanna believe, Ron,\nyou've worked with keyboards.\n\n103\n00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.370\nThere's no way, because I can see\none right now on your laptop.\n\n104\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.510\nYou've been using keyboards for\na long time, right?\n\n105\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.215\n>> I really have, I've been using\na keyboard before they were called\n\n106\n00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:41.964\nkeyboards, we called them a typewriter.\n\n107\n00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:45.720\nAnd so when you start off with this you\nmight be wondering why is a keyboard.\n\n108\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.595\nWhy is that technology that's still around\nwith computing today when it really\n\n109\n00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:55.249\nbegan in the 1800's, the idea of these\nkeys that were laid out for us and\n\n110\n00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:58.321\nbeing that it actually\ntyped one letter at a time.\n\n111\n00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:01.224\nNow we're in the second decade\nof the 21st century and\n\n112\n00:07:01.224 --> 00:07:05.810\nwe're still using a keyboard as kinda\nthe main input device for our computers.\n\n113\n00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.120\nAnd that is because we can actually\nenter a lot of data in very quickly,\n\n114\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.390\nand control what's on our computer\nscreens very quickly, in the keyboard.\n\n115\n00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.890\nEven though we're about to show you\nsome of the other input devices,\n\n116\n00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.880\nthey really do not have\nas much functionality or\n\n117\n00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.210\ndiversity in the way that\nyour keyboard has it.\n\n118\n00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.473\nSo you do need to become very\nfamiliar with the idea of\n\n119\n00:07:29.473 --> 00:07:33.270\nmaking sure that you understand\nhow to work with a keyboard.\n\n120\n00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.926\nAnd I would recommend the idea of\nlearning how to type if you do not know\n\n121\n00:07:36.926 --> 00:07:38.825\nhow to actually type on a keyboard.\n\n122\n00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:42.423\nAnd everybody will do it differently but\nyou probably actually can do that.\n\n123\n00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:46.996\nIt's one of the things that can hold\nyou back in your career in computings,\n\n124\n00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:51.353\nin computers, if you cannot actually\nnavigate around the idea of using\n\n125\n00:07:51.353 --> 00:07:54.343\nthe keyboard and\nunderstand its main function.\n\n126\n00:07:54.343 --> 00:07:57.894\nBecause that is your real interface\ninto the computing world.\n\n127\n00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:02.234\nIs through that input device there on\nthe keyboard, and it's so universal,\n\n128\n00:08:02.234 --> 00:08:05.870\nyou cannot just decide I'm\nnot gonna worry about it.\n\n129\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.330\nYou might find people that are actually\nable to do what they call hunt and peck.\n\n130\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.760\nAnd that is because they simply look for\na letter, and then they go ahead and\n\n131\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.370\nthey type it one at a time.\n\n132\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.920\nThat makes you very slow and\n\n133\n00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.270\nin this world that we're living in,\nwe cannot afford that.\n\n134\n00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.640\nSo overall though, the keyboard is\ndefinitely gonna be your friend,\n\n135\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.190\nbecause it will allow you\nto just about be able to do\n\n136\n00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.290\nany input on any type of device that Dr.\nTonny was talking about.\n\n137\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.803\nWhether we're talking about a smartphone,\nwhether we're talking about a tablet,\n\n138\n00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.291\nwhether we're talking about\na full size desktop computer,\n\n139\n00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:37.050\nwhether you're actually\nhaving to enter in things.\n\n140\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.750\nSuch as at an automatic teller machine\n\n141\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.090\nwhere you enter in a PIN number it\nreally is the basis of a keyboard.\n\n142\n00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.360\nSo you do need to become\nfamiliar with that technology and\n\n143\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.020\nthe great thing is there are so\nmany great ones whether ergonomic ones or\n\n144\n00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.420\nwhether they are actually\ntied to a specific function\n\n145\n00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.266\nperfectly fine you need to feel very\ncomfortable when working with this.\n\n146\n00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.215\n>> Well I've just displayed\na keyboard on my screen right now.\n\n147\n00:09:00.215 --> 00:09:04.480\nAnd as my colleague Ronnie\nhas actually mentioned\n\n148\n00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.240\nyou have an opportunity\nto master this key.\n\n149\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.360\nYou sometimes see people\ntyping with all their fingers.\n\n150\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.800\nThey somehow use all their\nfive ten fingers, all right?\n\n151\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.590\nAnd that way they're\nable to type much faster.\n\n152\n00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:26.220\nSo there software that can help you to\nbegin to master how to quickly type.\n\n153\n00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.460\nSo that the fingers are positioned\nto very specific keys.\n\n154\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.170\nSo you really don't have to start\nlooking where is letter T or where is F.\n\n155\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.410\nSo you cannot do it automatically, and you\nfocus on the screen as opposed to focusing\n\n156\n00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:44.430\non the keyboard So if you have\nyour fast four fingers focused and\n\n157\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.710\npositioned at A-S-D-F and\nthen you have the other one.\n\n158\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:53.420\nAnd then in the process each of these\nfingers is focused on the specific keys,\n\n159\n00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.770\nso as you type AWAD you just know well\nI need to type several characters.\n\n160\n00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.580\nAnd therefore these fingers\nwill automatically do it.\n\n161\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.670\nThen you can type your work very,\nvery fast.\n\n162\n00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.970\nYou can see that there are numbers there,\nthere are characters there.\n\n163\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.630\nThere's space, it's entering, etc.\n\n164\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:12.080\nSo as Ronnie said,\nI think if there's not out of market,\n\n165\n00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.890\nyou need to develop confidence\nin using the keyboard.\n\n166\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.800\nBecause it'll make life much easier and\nimprove your productivity.\n\n167\n00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.845\nPersonally, I find it much\nfaster to type than to write.\n\n168\n00:10:23.845 --> 00:10:25.100\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n169\n00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.860\n>> So and many other people as well find\nit that way and so then the computer\n\n170\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.580\nactually becomes a tool that has increased\nmy productivity and many other people.\n\n171\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.070\nAnd it can improve your\nproductivity as well.\n\n172\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.320\n>> I find it better to type because\nmy handwriting is really that bad.\n\n173\n00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.470\nThat people are constantly asking me why\ndid I write that so I simply type it out\n\n174\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.930\ninstead so it does have its functional\nnature as well as the ability to help us\n\n175\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.660\nin productivity but it's something that we\nshouldn't overlook or take for granted.\n\n176\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.720\nDo take the time to learn how to actually\nnavigate around that keyboard as well.\n\n177\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.310\nThe only last thing I want to\npoint out here is that sometimes\n\n178\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.470\nwhen you do switch between devices though,\nyou may find that it doesn't seem to have\n\n179\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.960\nall the same functionality\nas a full size keyboard.\n\n180\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.900\nFor example, on the keyboard that Dr.\nTonny just showed us, there was a little\n\n181\n00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.850\nkey in the lower left hand corner that\nsaid Fn, that stands for a function key.\n\n182\n00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.270\nYou may find out that one key actually\ncan represent more than one character,\n\n183\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.060\nby using that in combination as well.\n\n184\n00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.540\nAnd normally we see that on, notebooks and\nlaptops devices and so when you do see\n\n185\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.380\nthat don't get thrown by it's actually one\nof those keys as design to help you but\n\n186\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.920\nstill have the same in a minimal amount\nof space is what it's designed to do.\n\n187\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.081\nSo you will actually encounter them,\n\n188\n00:11:36.081 --> 00:11:40.538\nthere's no other way to do it when we get\ninto computing so become familiar with\n\n189\n00:11:40.538 --> 00:11:44.336\nthat at least the keyboard and\nthat will take you to a very long way.\n\n190\n00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:49.320\n>> Right, after keyboards, the next thing\nwe wanna think about is pointing devices.\n\n191\n00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.940\nAnd pointing devices, as the name suggests\nalso, they enable us to point something.\n\n192\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.220\nSo every time you see people\ntyping on a computer, every so\n\n193\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.860\noften they are moving something and\npointing something on the screen.\n\n194\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.000\nSo they say, well,\n\n195\n00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.300\nI'm moving my cursor somewhere so\nI can do something in particular.\n\n196\n00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.520\nThat different kinds of\npointing devices and\n\n197\n00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.420\nI think the starting point is the mouse.\n\n198\n00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.200\nAnd there are two types of mouses that\nI've generally seen, one is the mechanical\n\n199\n00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.550\none where there is a ball of\nrubber that is moving around and\n\n200\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.380\nenables the cursor to move and\nbased on some sensors in there.\n\n201\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.380\nAnd then there is the optical version that\n\n202\n00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.030\nopen it by bouncing some\nlight on a flat surface.\n\n203\n00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.960\nI didn't get to use the mechanical mouse.\n\n204\n00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.291\nI get the sense that\nRonnie may have used it so\n\n205\n00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:42.980\nI'll ask him to explain to us\na little bit about that mouse.\n\n206\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.630\n>> When you take a look at, and\nhopefully you will not have\n\n207\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:50.700\nto actually use the mechanical mouse\neither and the reason why is a, they work\n\n208\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.840\neffectively until you used them for\nlet's say three to six months or so and\n\n209\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.490\nthe reason why is that little rubberized\nball That Dr. Tonny was talking about.\n\n210\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:06.200\nIt picks up every little particle of\ndirt and grime that you can imagine.\n\n211\n00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.150\nAnd what begins to happen after a while\nis it builds up on that ball, and\n\n212\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.260\nthe ball is no longer as\nround as it needs to be.\n\n213\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.580\nAnd now when you go and try and\n\n214\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.910\nmove the cursor to a different location\non the screen it's not going to work.\n\n215\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.650\nAnd it worked based on a set of rollers\ninside of that device where every time you\n\n216\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:26.620\nmoved it it knew exactly how much to move\nas long as that ball was perfectly round.\n\n217\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.000\nBut after awhile it just wouldn't be and\nit would build up and\n\n218\n00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.330\ntransfer into those rollers.\n\n219\n00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.760\nAnd so these things,\nas much as they actually did work for\n\n220\n00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.860\nus in the early and\nactually through the 1990s and\n\n221\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.540\nactually up into the early 2000s,\n2000 through 2004 so.\n\n222\n00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.610\nThey really did help us because\neverybody was used to it.\n\n223\n00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.806\nBut they were frustrating to work\nwith because they would get dirty and\n\n224\n00:13:49.806 --> 00:13:53.771\nthen they wouldn't actually give you the\npinpoint precision that you actually need.\n\n225\n00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:56.450\nSo the idea here with using\nthat mechanical mouse,\n\n226\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.748\nhopefully is something you won't have to\nencounter but if you do you'll actually\n\n227\n00:14:00.748 --> 00:14:04.569\nfind yourself having to do maintenance\non that mouse fairly regularly.\n\n228\n00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:07.522\nSo hopefully if somebody is\nselling you a computer or\n\n229\n00:14:07.522 --> 00:14:11.751\nselling you computer components and\nsay here's a perfectly good mouse and\n\n230\n00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:15.708\nyou see that there's a rubberized\nball on the bottom of it, just say,\n\n231\n00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:17.880\nthank you very much, but I will pass.\n\n232\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.860\nAnd that will actually be the best\nway to go for what you want.\n\n233\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.012\nIf you want better\npinpoint precision though,\n\n234\n00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:26.364\nwe can actually talk about that idea\nof the optical mouse instead, okay.\n\n235\n00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:28.980\n>> So I think the optical\nmouse method is easier.\n\n236\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.720\nSo I'm a little more comfortable\ntalking about this one.\n\n237\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.000\nIt's the same concept,\nit's a pointing device.\n\n238\n00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.400\nSometimes it's connected to\nthe computer using say a USB cord or\n\n239\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.017\notherwise a USB interface or any other.\n\n240\n00:14:48.017 --> 00:14:52.670\nAnd using the technology\nbehind it if you've got\n\n241\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.690\nsome optical capability that now,\nsome light reflects at the base.\n\n242\n00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.560\nWe'll talk about that in a little while.\n\n243\n00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.740\nBut basically, right on top of it is\ndesigned to fit your hand very well.\n\n244\n00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:10.220\nAnd then, it's got an opportunity\nthat you can do a right button.\n\n245\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.810\nPress or left one, and\n\n246\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:17.540\nyou can scroll to move the cursor\non the desk, on your computer.\n\n247\n00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.910\nIt could be wireless as well.\n\n248\n00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.140\nAnd so there's that option as well.\n\n249\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.830\nAnd yeah, in terms of\n\n250\n00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:30.810\nthe physics behind the optical capability,\nRonnie, you seem to be having some\n\n251\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.141\nvery solid physics background\non how that light bounces back.\n\n252\n00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:35.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n253\n00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.220\npoints then to some sensor in there.\n\n254\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.030\nAnd then finally reflects on the screen.\n\n255\n00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.910\nHow does that go?\n\n256\n00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:42.410\n>> Yeah.\n\n257\n00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.650\nThat's pretty much the way\nthat it works out.\n\n258\n00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.250\nOn the bottom of the mouse there's\na little tiny hole that you'll actually\n\n259\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.190\nend up seeing.\n\n260\n00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.085\nAnd normally most of these\nhave a little red light.\n\n261\n00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:53.193\nIf you pick them up you see the red\nlight and then it goes dim.\n\n262\n00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:57.038\nAnd it's actually measuring the surface\nand the distance between the surface and\n\n263\n00:15:57.038 --> 00:16:00.716\nthat A little place that actually does and\nthen as you move it across it actually\n\n264\n00:16:00.716 --> 00:16:04.490\nunderstands the location and\nthose in versus where you moving it to.\n\n265\n00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:09.720\nThe advantage of this is that it doesn't\nmatter about dirt and dust because\n\n266\n00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.890\nnot a lot gets up there and it actually\npinpointing a particular location.\n\n267\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.790\nNow, do not misunderstand me if you\nhappen to like peanut butter, Dr,\n\n268\n00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.797\nTony do you like peanut butter?\n\n269\n00:16:18.797 --> 00:16:20.905\n>> Yeah.\n\n270\n00:16:20.905 --> 00:16:24.171\n>> Now, if you eat a peanut butter\nsandwich and you get all your fingers and\n\n271\n00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:27.788\nyou smear that into it then no,\nno, the mouse will no longer work.\n\n272\n00:16:27.788 --> 00:16:31.170\nBut if you're doing anything else\nit will continue to work for\n\n273\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.110\nyou relatively problem free.\n\n274\n00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.990\nThis mouse itself may actually\nclose to five or six years old and\n\n275\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.060\nI never had to clean it overall\nas far as the actual optics go.\n\n276\n00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.590\nBut that's because it actually\ndoes bounce light off and\n\n277\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.120\nwhen it actually does that it\nthen knows how to measure that.\n\n278\n00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.110\nAnd then it actually reflects off of\na mirror into a little, tiny camera.\n\n279\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.540\nAnd it actually reports\nthat back to the computer\n\n280\n00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.520\nsoftware that needs to actually say\nhere's where we're located on the string.\n\n281\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.510\nNow, the idea of the mouse is fairly\nintuitive for us because we take it and\n\n282\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.580\nwe move it across the surface and\n\n283\n00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:08.490\nit's us really physically directing where\nit moves on the screen of our computer.\n\n284\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.970\nNow, by doing that, that's great\n\n285\n00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.710\nas long as you have plenty of surface area\nto the right or the left of your computer.\n\n286\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.876\nBut, sometimes you don't\nhave that surface and\n\n287\n00:17:17.876 --> 00:17:21.451\nso, all of a sudden what you hear across\na lot of offices, right is you hear this.\n\n288\n00:17:21.451 --> 00:17:22.890\n[SOUND]\n>> Yeah.\n\n289\n00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.047\n>> And that's because they're\nhaving to pick up the mouse and\n\n290\n00:17:26.047 --> 00:17:27.950\njust try to you know scroll it over.\n\n291\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.660\nAnd so\nyou might hear that kind of soft and\n\n292\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.460\nyou're like I know what they're doing\nthey don't have enough movement area.\n\n293\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.400\nSo that their mouse can actually move from\none edge of the screen to the other edge\n\n294\n00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.280\nof the screen and that becomes\na limitation of the mouse itself.\n\n295\n00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.060\nNow, it's a lot easier to this wireless,\nokay so\n\n296\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.690\nyou don't have to be constrained by that.\n\n297\n00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.950\nBut you will still get somebody that will\ndo that because once again they move to\n\n298\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.010\na certain edge, they realize they\nrun out of room, they pick it up.\n\n299\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.840\nAnd that's what you'll hear all the time.\n\n300\n00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.870\nI hear it in offices constantly,\n\n301\n00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.349\nespecially when people are working in\nsmaller cubicle types of areas instead.\n\n302\n00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:04.330\n>> \u007fYou may want to explain, Ronnie,\nevery time I plug this onto my computer,\n\n303\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.710\nit seems to automatically peak.\n\n304\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.018\nAnd I just screen it right now,\nas I point,\n\n305\n00:18:09.018 --> 00:18:12.100\nas I I'm immediately seeing\nthe red light on it.\n\n306\n00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.390\nWould you want to explain the plug and\nplay concept here?\n\n307\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.920\n>> Sure, when we start talking about this\nidea, most of the computing systems today,\n\n308\n00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.620\nit runs an operating system instead\nof you having to say, all right.\n\n309\n00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.780\nI've just plugged a physical device in.\n\n310\n00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.920\nNow how does the operating\nsystem recognize that?\n\n311\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.120\nWell then it actually normally asks me\nto insert a driver, another additional\n\n312\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.390\nsoftware that says yes, the operating\nsystem can communicate with that device.\n\n313\n00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.120\nMost of the operating systems today\n\n314\n00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.000\nthey work off of a standard\nthat we call plug and play.\n\n315\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.315\nAnd that means they've already built that\nfeature into the operating system on your\n\n316\n00:18:48.315 --> 00:18:51.060\ncomputer so\nthat when it detects a device plugged in.\n\n317\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:56.365\nIt automatically searches through it's\nparticular database of those devices and\n\n318\n00:18:56.365 --> 00:19:00.090\nthen it automatically loads\na very generic driver.\n\n319\n00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.400\nSo that you can use\nthe functionality of that device.\n\n320\n00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.270\nInput devices are very\nmuch one of the standards\n\n321\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.690\nthat you tend to find across\nmultiple operating systems.\n\n322\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.980\nAnd this is true whether\nyou're talking about Linux,\n\n323\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.560\nwhether you're talking about Macintosh OS,\nor whether you're talking about Windows.\n\n324\n00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.470\nThey normally already have a few\nof these in there, that you\n\n325\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.770\ndon't have to worry about going out and\nsearching for a particular device driver.\n\n326\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.650\nTo make that function\nwith the computer itself.\n\n327\n00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:32.640\nSo that is the concept of plug and play\nand it also really got this normalization\n\n328\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.870\nand standardization really when USB became\nvery popular as far as the standard goes.\n\n329\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.820\n>> Ronnie as I was walking\nin your office I came across\n\n330\n00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.850\nsomething that really looks\nlike spaceship mouse.\n\n331\n00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.210\nI thought we had a mouse before but\nno I just learned that this is\n\n332\n00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:55.270\na track ball well look I can see\na ball it seems like it can come out.\n\n333\n00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.370\nAnd I learned that it is\nactually a pointing device.\n\n334\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:03.044\nNow tell me something,\nis this superior to the mechanical mouse.\n\n335\n00:20:03.044 --> 00:20:04.229\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n336\n00:20:04.229 --> 00:20:06.283\notherwise what's the difference here?\n\n337\n00:20:06.283 --> 00:20:10.906\n>> Yeah, the main difference here is\nactually a very visible difference in\n\n338\n00:20:10.906 --> 00:20:15.677\nthe way that I was showing you that\na mouse actually moves on a flat surface,\n\n339\n00:20:15.677 --> 00:20:16.230\nright?\n\n340\n00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.510\nSo that we can control where\npointer goes on the screen.\n\n341\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.360\nOn this one if I am limited by an area,\n\n342\n00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.550\nit's not that I have to\nmove the entire device.\n\n343\n00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:30.960\nAll I have to do is actually roll this and\ninstead it actually is what moves it.\n\n344\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.460\nSo I no longer have to have a tremendous\namount of area to my right or\n\n345\n00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.740\nto the left of my keyboard.\n\n346\n00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.710\nI can now have this set in\na stationary position and\n\n347\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.070\nthen by simply being able to adjust\nthe movement of my fingers across that,\n\n348\n00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.170\nI can actually control\nthe movement of that mouse.\n\n349\n00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:51.700\nSo this allows me to not have to\nworry about do I have enough space,\n\n350\n00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.890\nit allows me about working a relatively\nconfined space if I need to.\n\n351\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.510\nAnd to have the same functionalities\nas the mouse buttons to be able to do\n\n352\n00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:04.070\nclicks or I can select something or it's\nnormally inside of a Windows environment.\n\n353\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.030\nIf you do a right-click which\nis gonna be on the other side,\n\n354\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.350\non the right button instead,\n\n355\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.430\nthat allows me to actually show a bunch\nof additional selections that I can make.\n\n356\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.570\nThe mouse allows me to even,\non my podium which is relatively small\n\n357\n00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.970\nI can set it right here on the corner\nedge and Doctor Tonnie can vouch for\n\n358\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.010\nyou maybe about the size of my\nhand is as far as that edge goes.\n\n359\n00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.401\nAnd I can actually use that mouse and that\nball, actually be able to manipulate or\n\n360\n00:21:28.401 --> 00:21:32.007\nuse my pointing device all over\nmy screen without having to go.\n\n361\n00:21:32.007 --> 00:21:37.920\nI'm off the edge of my table top now and\nI really don't have enough area to do it.\n\n362\n00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.750\nAnd so,\nis very specific in this application.\n\n363\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.010\nAs far as being better\nthan a mechanical mouse,\n\n364\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.240\njust about anything is better\nthan the mechanical mouse, okay.\n\n365\n00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.420\nSo, if you wanna actually compare that,\n\n366\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.750\nyes this is a 100 times better\nthan the mechanical mouse.\n\n367\n00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.730\nIf you're used to coming to it\nfrom a mousing environment,\n\n368\n00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.080\nthat one that you always use a mouse,\nit is difficult.\n\n369\n00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.070\nIt does, your dexterity in your hands and\nyour fingers work a little bit differently\n\n370\n00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.840\nand the first few days that I tried\nto do it my hand actually got tired.\n\n371\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.980\nMy fingers got tired because I was really\nhaving to learn how to manipulate but\n\n372\n00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.790\nthis time without moving the entire\narm and actually moving the fingers.\n\n373\n00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.740\nSo, it's a little bit challenging, but\nonce you get used to it people really do\n\n374\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:22.070\nlike the trackball quite more\neven in comparison to a mouse.\n\n375\n00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:24.010\n>> Okay.\n\n376\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.680\nSo the other form of input\nthat is also very common is\n\n377\n00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:34.580\nthe touch where you can\nactually touch a surface or\n\n378\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:40.720\na screen and be able to input\nsome data into a computer.\n\n379\n00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.610\nMost of this is a touch pad.\n\n380\n00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:47.830\nFor those who use computers,\nlaptops in particular, personal laptops,\n\n381\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.410\nthere's always an opportunity\nto move around.\n\n382\n00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.720\nThere's a touch sensitive kind of\nscreen surface that enables you to move\n\n383\n00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.080\nthe cursor just by moving your finger,\npressing your finger on that surface and\n\n384\n00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.700\nmoving your finger around.\n\n385\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.030\nAnd in the process you\nget to move the cursor,\n\n386\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.540\nwhich the cursor being\nthe pointing device.\n\n387\n00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:13.170\nThe point that you're actually able to\ndetermine where exactly are you going\n\n388\n00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.240\nto type, or where you're going\nto click and things like that.\n\n389\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.216\nWhich we'll have the touchscreen and\nthe touchscreen just like a phone.\n\n390\n00:23:21.216 --> 00:23:26.088\nThe touchscreen has the option of\nbeing the display as well as being\n\n391\n00:23:26.088 --> 00:23:30.680\nthe input device so\nas I move my finger on the screen.\n\n392\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:36.160\nI'm able to move things around and\nclicks things and stops applications.\n\n393\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.400\nSo touch has become a very\neffective mechanism.\n\n394\n00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.514\nIt was seemed to be more\ncomfortable using your fingers.\n\n395\n00:23:44.514 --> 00:23:47.137\nAnd the many things you can do\nwith those types of screens.\n\n396\n00:23:47.137 --> 00:23:52.997\nBecause you can tap, you can drag,\nyou can swipe, you can pinch.\n\n397\n00:23:52.997 --> 00:23:57.260\nI have seen everybody move things\nquickly together or blow them up, so\n\n398\n00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.950\nthat you can see them a lot more quickly.\n\n399\n00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.630\nYou can stretch,\nyou can even rotate an image.\n\n400\n00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.620\nSo that's a beauty of task screens,\n\n401\n00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.960\nbecause there's a great\ndegree of flexibility.\n\n402\n00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.650\nYeah, it really becomes a little bit more\nintuitive to the way that we naturally do\n\n403\n00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:16.260\nthings, which is by touch and feel,\nbut it does take a little bit of time\n\n404\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.570\nespecially on a computer screen if\nyou're doing something like this.\n\n405\n00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.260\nAnd even in a smartphone\nif you're not used to it,\n\n406\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.260\nbecause well you're just not used to it.\n\n407\n00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.010\nAnd so you do have to learn for\n\n408\n00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.680\nthat particular mechanism how those\ndifferent functions may work.\n\n409\n00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.360\nSome of them do translate over\ninto different devices, but\n\n410\n00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.770\nsome of them may not.\n\n411\n00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.930\nBut you actually see that the more\nthat you actually work with it,\n\n412\n00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.375\nthe more intuitive it gets,\nand the easier it becomes.\n\n413\n00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:41.190\nDr. Tawny, I remember the first\ntime I actually had an iPad, and\n\n414\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.080\nI had to try and type an email with it.\n\n415\n00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.110\nI found it incredibly difficult to learn\nhow to type everything with my thumbs.\n\n416\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.930\nBut after a couple of days it\njust seemed like second nature.\n\n417\n00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.140\nBut I was used to saying, there's no way\nI can do this during the first couple of\n\n418\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.690\ndays because I was holding\nthe device like this but\n\n419\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.980\ncouple of days later I was there\ndoing it like it was natural.\n\n420\n00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.370\nSo you can in this environment,\nespecially in the touch environment\n\n421\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.650\nwhere most of these devices don't\never come with instructions.\n\n422\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.710\nIf you've just gotten a new smartphone,\nif you've just gotten a new tablet,\n\n423\n00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.530\nyou'll see that it doesn't come with\nan instruction manual on how to do it.\n\n424\n00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.140\nThey're just saying look, you can just\npick this thing up and just touch it and\n\n425\n00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.310\nwatch what happens when you do so.\n\n426\n00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.570\nAnd then you'll pick up some of the other\nmore specialized things along the way.\n\n427\n00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.830\nSo touch is gonna be here and\nprobably still the wave of the future.\n\n428\n00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:30.900\nInside of a business environment,\nit hasn't really caught on as much, and\n\n429\n00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.520\nthe reason why is that\nthey are temperamental.\n\n430\n00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.190\nIf you happen to accidentally\ndrop that screen,\n\n431\n00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.640\nwell, you've not only broken the screen,\nbut you've broken your input, and\n\n432\n00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.295\nyour output device, and\nthe processing unit, at the same time.\n\n433\n00:25:43.295 --> 00:25:43.926\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n434\n00:25:43.926 --> 00:25:46.900\nmost of it's that to isolate\nthe idea of breakage here.\n\n435\n00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.110\n>> You might still find that they're still\nrelying on the traditional types of input\n\n436\n00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.760\ndevices but overall though,\n\n437\n00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.410\nthe world is moving to that and\nyou'll see that even computing systems\n\n438\n00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.640\nactually move to where those screens\nare actually touch sensitive as well.\n\n439\n00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.478\nSo we're starting to see more and\nmore of that too.\n\n440\n00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:07.990\nAnd it is a great technology\nas long as it works perfectly.\n\n441\n00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.280\nYou don't ever notice it\nwhen it works terribly.\n\n442\n00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.190\nYou notice every defect to that\nenvironment that's possible.\n\n443\n00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.550\nIt's amazing how quickly you notice it.\n\n444\n00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.610\n>> Well the other, along the same lines,\nwe've got other input devices\n\n445\n00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:28.010\nthat we may not really spend a lot\nof time on things like joysticks\n\n446\n00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.992\nwhich are kind of like and you can move\nthings around like a gear of a car,\n\n447\n00:26:31.992 --> 00:26:37.640\nthere are drawing tablets where\nyou can use a stylus to probably\n\n448\n00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.600\nwrite on it and then that content is\nautomatically captured onto the computer.\n\n449\n00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.810\nNot very common, yeah, but\nthen there are people who still use them.\n\n450\n00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.270\nProbably you may or\nmay not get an opportunity to use them.\n\n451\n00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.940\nBut let's go on to scanners.\n\n452\n00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.610\nBefore computers came, and\n\n453\n00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:01.700\neven still now, we create a lot\nof documents, physical documents.\n\n454\n00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.630\nWe print stuff, we draw things,\nwe take photos, etc.\n\n455\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:09.740\nAnd every so often we want to digitize\nthat content, we want to convert it into\n\n456\n00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.920\ndigital format and store it on\ncomputer because it's very easy,\n\n457\n00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.740\nit's very easy to move it around,\nto share the files and things like that.\n\n458\n00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:24.170\nSo scanners are one of\nthe best technology that\n\n459\n00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:28.099\nenables us to convert physical\ndocuments into digital documents.\n\n460\n00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:34.730\n>> We have different kind of scanners,\nthose that can take several documents at\n\n461\n00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:40.248\na goal, or one after another,\nfeeding into the scanner a lot faster.\n\n462\n00:27:40.248 --> 00:27:44.530\nThere's the flatbed option,\nwhere you just place one document and\n\n463\n00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.390\nthen you kind of like cover it and\nthen you press a button, and\n\n464\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:52.170\nit's just one document at a time and\nyou have to open that screen again.\n\n465\n00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.830\nWhatever it is, some of those we\nhave feeders that enable us to scan\n\n466\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.283\ndocuments quickly whatever\nit maybe on my screen.\n\n467\n00:28:00.283 --> 00:28:05.310\nI'm just demonstrating one scanner\nwhich is the flatbed scanner.\n\n468\n00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:11.300\nAnd if you can see basically,\nthis is very simple illustration\n\n469\n00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:17.390\nof a scanner flatbed where you open it up,\nyou put that document and you cover.\n\n470\n00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.990\nYou press a button and you go.\n\n471\n00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.580\nSome of them are wireless and\nsome of them have physical connections,\n\n472\n00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.510\nso the document then is\ntransmitted to the computer.\n\n473\n00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.640\nAnd then you can do whatever\nyou wanna do with it.\n\n474\n00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.020\nAnd you can reproduce, you can edit.\n\n475\n00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.080\nI've found a scanner to be very useful.\n\n476\n00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:40.320\nOne particular example of where it was so\nuseful is I'd already traveled,\n\n477\n00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.800\nand I was supposed to submit\na certain document to someone else.\n\n478\n00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.980\nAnd I'd already left my home country,\nand that document was urgently needed.\n\n479\n00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.800\nAnd all I did is send a message to\nsomeone, go pick that document,\n\n480\n00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.700\nand scan it and send it that soft\ncopy to me exactly as I've written it\n\n481\n00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.270\nwith my signature over there.\n\n482\n00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.330\nAnd then I attached it to someone else,\nand\n\n483\n00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.509\nin a matter of seconds that document was\navailable in another part of the world.\n\n484\n00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.510\nSo have you scanned something before,\nRonnie?\n\n485\n00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:12.860\n>> I have used scanners quite often in\nmy life with dealing with computing.\n\n486\n00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:17.950\nScanners really do help us out in being\nable to do what Doctor Tony talked about,\n\n487\n00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:23.130\ndigitizing a physical copy of something so\nthat we can store it as a file somewhere.\n\n488\n00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.250\nAnd then that file can be delivered or\nagain, just stored.\n\n489\n00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.160\nAnd then we can get rid of\nthe physical copy if we need to.\n\n490\n00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.570\nScanning technologies such as the flatbed\nscanners have pretty much been traditional\n\n491\n00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.660\nin businesses because a lot of\nthose documents do need to get\n\n492\n00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.010\nconverted that way.\n\n493\n00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.438\nBut Dr. Tonie, I actually have\na scanner on my smart phone.\n\n494\n00:29:40.438 --> 00:29:41.850\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As well, and\n\n495\n00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.070\nthat type of scanner is\nactually a software scanner.\n\n496\n00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:50.050\nIt’s an application that I downloaded and\nwas able to put onto my phone and\n\n497\n00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.800\nnow what I can do instead is I\ncan launch that application and\n\n498\n00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.330\nit runs on my phone and it looks like\nI'm taking a picture of that document.\n\n499\n00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:04.200\nBut when I do so with that application,\nit digitizes what it sees.\n\n500\n00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.750\nAnd that is what we call OCR,\noptical character recognition.\n\n501\n00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.770\nIt literally can take that picture and\nsay, I'm going to translate that letter O\n\n502\n00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:19.150\ninto an actual font and\nnow that document can become editable.\n\n503\n00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:23.360\nSo in other words, I can now edit that\ndocument if I need to to be able scan it.\n\n504\n00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.760\nSo I'm not actually just getting\na picture of the document, but\n\n505\n00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.130\nactually something that is editable for\n\n506\n00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.510\nme to be able to have, and\nI could also use it for archival purposes.\n\n507\n00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:36.030\nNow the one on my phone,\nI don't use it for editing.\n\n508\n00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:40.310\nI do use it for archival purposes instead\nand you can find things like that, and\n\n509\n00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:45.860\nthat is because that technology has\nactually developed so incredibly fast and\n\n510\n00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:51.560\nso well that now any flatbed scanner\n\n511\n00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:57.330\nused to cost two to three hundred dollars,\nanybody can now download the app for $3.\n\n512\n00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.220\nSo it tells you how quickly\nthe market has dropped\n\n513\n00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.275\nbecause now I can just take my phone and\ndo exactly the same thing page by page.\n\n514\n00:31:04.275 --> 00:31:07.140\nDr. Tani, if you told me that you\nneeded that and you were in Nairobi,\n\n515\n00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.430\nright now I could go ahead and\nsay all right, here's that doc, and\n\n516\n00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.590\nyou said you need it scanned.\n\n517\n00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.510\nI can scan it and then I email it to you.\n\n518\n00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:16.910\nAnd you print it out, and it's just like\na scanner, exactly like a scanner, and\n\n519\n00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:18.780\nthat's exactly what you would see.\n\n520\n00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:23.410\nAnd so it didn't even take me\nhaving to get on anything else.\n\n521\n00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.810\nThe same device that I'm talking\nto Dr Tonny on on my smartphone,\n\n522\n00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:30.650\nI can scan the same device,\nemail it to him, all in one.\n\n523\n00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.955\nScanners are a really neat technology for\nus.\n\n524\n00:31:32.955 --> 00:31:34.370\n>> Mm-hm, wonderful.\n\n525\n00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:39.134\nSo we'll come to a close on the input\ndevices, but it's important for\n\n526\n00:31:39.134 --> 00:31:43.982\nyou to realize that there are other\ncommon input devices that sometimes\n\n527\n00:31:43.982 --> 00:31:46.109\nwe don't think that they are.\n\n528\n00:31:46.109 --> 00:31:47.861\nThink about a microphone.\n\n529\n00:31:47.861 --> 00:31:51.802\nWe can connect a microphone to\na computer and capture sound.\n\n530\n00:31:51.802 --> 00:31:55.023\nAll right, we can have headphones, and\n\n531\n00:31:55.023 --> 00:31:59.590\nsometimes some of them have\nan ability to capture sound.\n\n532\n00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.860\nSo that's another example\nof an input device.\n\n533\n00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:07.900\nSo any voice recognition kind of a device\nis actually an input device in itself,\n\n534\n00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.870\nthink about a camera.\n\n535\n00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:14.070\nWe can connect a camera to a computer,\nand take photos or videos, or\n\n536\n00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:19.390\nsome computers actually have cameras\ninbuilt into them, like laptops typically.\n\n537\n00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:23.400\nOr you can mount a webcam onto a computer,\nand\n\n538\n00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.650\nthat way you can have a conversation with\nsomeone, and they actually see you live,\n\n539\n00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.360\nalmost live, so to speak,\non the other end of the conversation.\n\n540\n00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:38.540\nYou can have a physical camera\ncapturing what's happening on this end,\n\n541\n00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.920\nand then as we speak right now, you're\nprobably seeing a presentation on screen.\n\n542\n00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.480\nAnd we must have used an input device to\ncapture that content onto a computer,\n\n543\n00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.100\notherwise it will have\nbeen very difficult.\n\n544\n00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:54.900\nThere are scanners that I use to capture\n\n545\n00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:00.210\ncontent on a credit card or a debit card,\nthat's a typical card reader.\n\n546\n00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.920\nWe sometimes call magnetic card readers.\n\n547\n00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.610\nYou can swipe a card,\nthat's a form of input into a computer.\n\n548\n00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:12.949\nAnd sometimes you can have fingerprint\nreaders, which are used now to identify\n\n549\n00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:16.837\npeople, because there's something\nunique about your fingerprint,\n\n550\n00:33:16.837 --> 00:33:19.870\nand that becomes a form\nof input into a computer.\n\n551\n00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:27.080\nSometimes you can have, on smartphones\nin particular, you can have QR codes.\n\n552\n00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.880\nYou have applications\nthat can capture content\n\n553\n00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:36.230\nby reading the various codes\nthat are available out there.\n\n554\n00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.560\nSometimes we have bar code readers, yeah,\n\n555\n00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.486\nwhich are used in supermarkets, or\nshopping malls, or even petrol stations.\n\n556\n00:33:44.486 --> 00:33:48.000\nIn those kind of things, sometimes\nwhen you drive around you can see\n\n557\n00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.980\nsomething has captured\nsome details of your car.\n\n558\n00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.860\nAll those are possible different types\nof imports they can be capturing\n\n559\n00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:02.240\nlight, sound, image,\ntext or whatever it is.\n\n560\n00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.062\nSo just get a set of those input devices,\nand all that content goes into\n\n561\n00:34:07.062 --> 00:34:12.563\nthe computer and becomes digitized, and\nbecomes in form of binary form input.\n\n562\n00:34:12.563 --> 00:34:16.666\nBut the computer has a capacity to\nunderstand all different kind of inputs\n\n563\n00:34:16.666 --> 00:34:19.800\nand process them and\nlater on they become output.\n\n564\n00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.900\nSo in our next session we'll be\ntalking about output devices.\n\n565\n00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.065\n>> All right, that sounds good, and\nthat means we are going to come back for\n\n566\n00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:31.365\na part two in input and\noutput as well as storage devices.\n\n567\n00:34:31.365 --> 00:34:34.560\nSo that's a great place for\nus to also wrap this episode up.\n\n568\n00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.213\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong\n\n569\n00:34:38.213 --> 00:34:39.391\n>> And my name is

Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.820\nyou're watching\nthe Computing Fundamentals IC3 show.\n\n5\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.630\nNow, we're about to take a look into,\n\n6\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.600\nwell, the second part of input,\noutput, and storage devices.\n\n7\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.490\nWe're about to get in some\ndifferent output devices and\n\n8\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.347\nwho better to help us to understand\nthat than Dr. Tonny Omwansa.\n\n9\n00:00:32.347 --> 00:00:33.820\nDr. Omwansa, welcome back.\n\n10\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.800\n>> Thank you very much,\n\n11\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.860\nit's always a great pleasure to spend\ntime together thinking about technology.\n\n12\n00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.910\nAnd thinking about output devices and\nstorage devices will be exciting.\n\n13\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.820\n>> All right, so as we take a look here,\nwhat we're now moving into is that\n\n14\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.830\nrealm of what we call output devices\n>> When we have inputs such as when we\n\n15\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.300\nactually type in something in our keyboard\nor we move something around on the mouse,\n\n16\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.120\nthere has to be a way that confirms\nthat we're actually either clicking on\n\n17\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.850\nthe right portion or actually typing in\nthe content that we believe that we need.\n\n18\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.920\nAnd so we generally have output\ndevices that display for\n\n19\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.060\nus the result of what we\nactually have just done.\n\n20\n00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.260\nSo Dr. Tony there are many different types\nof output devices what are we gonna talk\n\n21\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.760\nabout first?\n\n22\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.750\n>> Well, there are so many.\n\n23\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.840\nActually there are very many and\n\n24\n00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.850\nsometimes there some things we don't\nquite think about them as output devices.\n\n25\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.130\nSo let's just take an example.\n\n26\n00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.140\nThere is a speaker.\n\n27\n00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.600\nSo some music was playing on\na computer and I can hear it somewhere.\n\n28\n00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.480\nSo it's basically getting out what is one\nthe computer and we're able to see it.\n\n29\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.670\nThink about a printer.\n\n30\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.560\nI printed something physical.\n\n31\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.460\nIs actually an output devices calling\nsomething off the computer and\n\n32\n00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.820\ngot it out somehow that\nI can easily consume it.\n\n33\n00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.330\nOr just think about what's being\ndisplayed on the screen, so\n\n34\n00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330\nthe screen is actively\nacting as an output device.\n\n35\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.400\nSo anything that is able to get content\nfrom the computer and display it or\n\n36\n00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.150\npresent it in a manner that we can consume\nit, in a manner that we can understand it,\n\n37\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.140\nthen it becomes an output device.\n\n38\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.990\nSo a great place to start is to\nthink about the screens that we use.\n\n39\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.330\nDifferent kind of screens and\ndifferent technologies that have\n\n40\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.040\nevolved over time that enable\nus to see things on-screen.\n\n41\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.380\nGenerally the one old technology that I\nknow is the cathode ray tube I remember,\n\n42\n00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.100\nand we have this screen and\nit's protruding backwards.\n\n43\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.470\nAnd there is a technology that presents\ncontent onto the screen itself.\n\n44\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.630\nRonnie, I think you understand\nsome of these physics in terms of\n\n45\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.100\nhow that cathode ray tube works\nbefore we go into the LCD.\n\n46\n00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.220\n>> When we start taking a look at\nthe idea of the cathode ray tube.\n\n47\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.360\nWhat we really have in the background are\nthree different lights that essentially\n\n48\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.060\nproject the image that we're expecting\nto see up against a phosphorus screen\n\n49\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.170\nin front of the actual television set or\nthe computer monitor that we see.\n\n50\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.060\nSo inside, there's a vacuum\nthat they've actually got and\n\n51\n00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.990\nthen usually on the back of that screen\nthere is some type of fluorescent or\n\n52\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.850\nphosphorous type of screen that\nactually lights up when light hits it.\n\n53\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.980\nAnd so when you have something like this,\nit actually takes a lot of heat\n\n54\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.850\nIt takes a lot of electricity\nto generate what we see.\n\n55\n00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.200\nNormally, what you're actually\nseeing is a single pinpoint of light\n\n56\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.600\ndrawn from one edge to the other edge and\nthan zigzagging a pattern down the screen.\n\n57\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.480\nAnd what you're really looking at\nis a faded image, in other words,\n\n58\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.320\nthe image is actually gone,\nit's just happening so\n\n59\n00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.840\nfast that your eyes are not actually able\nto realize that what you're staring at is,\n\n60\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.800\non that cathode ray tube,\nan image that has already dissipated.\n\n61\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.600\nSo it's happening so many times\nper second, it looks like a live\n\n62\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.810\nimage right before you, but\nit's really a faded out type of image.\n\n63\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.570\nAnd so this type of technology\nas well as it worked though\n\n64\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.400\nhad some drawbacks such as electromagnetic\nfields that it would generate.\n\n65\n00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.430\nIt also had some different things in terms\nof the amount of energy that it would have\n\n66\n00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.890\nto generate and of course they\nwere easily broken after awhile.\n\n67\n00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.400\nAnd you could even make adjustments\nin your computing settings\n\n68\n00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.670\nthat you would have that could possibly\nbreak this cathode ray tube as well.\n\n69\n00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.580\nSo all these combinations here,\n\n70\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.430\nand the age of the computers of course,\nkind of after a while, led you to\n\n71\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.370\nrealize that these types of screens were\nnot gonna be long for the computing world.\n\n72\n00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.780\nAnd we tended to see them really drop off\nabout 2007, 2008, somewhere around there,\n\n73\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.620\nis where you tended to see the majority\nof these in the business world, at least\n\n74\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.560\nhere in the United States, where they\nkind of disappeared almost completely.\n\n75\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.620\n>> Actually I've barely seen them now\neven in other parts of the world.\n\n76\n00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.880\nThey are rarely seen and it seems like\npeople have moved on to much more\n\n77\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.210\nconvenient, cheaper,\nmore cost effective, uses less power and\n\n78\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.030\nthings like that and now there comes the\nliquid crystal displays kind of screens.\n\n79\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.560\nAnd I can see right here,\nyou're displaying one of them.\n\n80\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.710\n>> Here.\nLet me go ahead and hold that up.\n\n81\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.590\n>> Maybe you wanna tell us\nwhat is this liquid crystal,\n\n82\n00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.175\nare you carrying some\nliquid crystal right now?\n\n83\n00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:09.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I am carrying some liquid crystal\n\n84\n00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.780\nright here.\n\n85\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.820\nOn this one, this is also\nknown as a flat panel monitor.\n\n86\n00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.710\nAnd you can see why.\n\n87\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.800\nThere's no actual back tube\nthat we have to worry about on\n\n88\n00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.960\nthis edge that's sticking out of the back.\n\n89\n00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.200\nIt is light enough for\nme to hold with one arm.\n\n90\n00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.210\nA monitor,\n\n91\n00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.090\na CRT monitor of the same comparable size,\nthere is no way that I could actually have\n\n92\n00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.570\nphysically held this thing up without\ncrying because of the weight of it.\n\n93\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.790\nSo this one is a little bit lighter.\n\n94\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.310\nAnd it's because the technology is\nactually all implemented in the single\n\n95\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.150\npanel that we have here called an LCD\nscreen, which is a liquid crystal display.\n\n96\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.020\nAnd this particular type of technology\ndoesn't project anything, but\n\n97\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.830\nwhat it does is it takes the input\nfrom the computer and displays it and\n\n98\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.180\nactually sends it to different\nlocations on the screen itself.\n\n99\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.680\nAnd then the liquid crystals\nitself know how to align\n\n100\n00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.390\nthat to show us the images that we need.\n\n101\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.300\nIn the background though, the thickness of\nthis happens to deal with the very light\n\n102\n00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.040\nsource which is normally some\ntype of fluorescent lamp or\n\n103\n00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.430\na cold cathode flourescent lamp\ntube that's in the background so\n\n104\n00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.870\nit doesn't tend to generate a lot of heat.\n\n105\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.030\nSo this particular type of\nmonitor is much more efficient.\n\n106\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.610\nIt can produce as good of\na display as some CRT models can,\n\n107\n00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.830\nbut it actually has what\nwe call a fixed resolution.\n\n108\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.670\nSo, in this sense,\nthere's only a certain amount of\n\n109\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.860\npixels here that can be displayed and\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n110\n00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.610\nYou cannot adjust it.\n\n111\n00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.270\nBut this is probably the most common\ntype of monitor that you'll frun into.\n\n112\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.740\nMost of the newer ones today,\nthis was a bit older, or even lighter.\n\n113\n00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.700\nIn other words, a lot of times,\n\n114\n00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.500\nI can actually carry two\nof these in one arm today,\n\n115\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.570\nwhereas this one is actually relatively\nheavy because it's a little bit older.\n\n116\n00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.300\nSo depending on the technology,\nyou'll actually see, of course,\n\n117\n00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.400\nvarying different sizes, and even now,\nbecause of how good this technology has\n\n118\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.340\ngotten, that you actually see that\nthey're modern flat screen TV sets,\n\n119\n00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.630\nthey're actually made of\nthe same type of technology.\n\n120\n00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.210\nSo you're starting to see that where the\ncomputer world has really had an effect on\n\n121\n00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.020\nthe entertainment world, in which flat\nscreen monitors are now kind of again,\n\n122\n00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.430\neven the norm compared to those old\n\n123\n00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.929\nactual kind of gigantic TV sets\nthat we used to see a lot of times.\n\n124\n00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.160\n>> Hey, great.\n\n125\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.300\nThat gives us a sense\nof some of the display.\n\n126\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.680\nRight now, my computer.\n\n127\n00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.690\nI've actually positioned two\nthings that are also interesting\n\n128\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.790\nto think about when we talk about display,\nor output devices.\n\n129\n00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.040\nNow projectors are become very common.\n\n130\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.265\nProjectors simply like the one\non my right now is a projector,\n\n131\n00:07:50.265 --> 00:07:55.628\nyou connected on your computer and then\nit projects a big kind of like transfers\n\n132\n00:07:55.628 --> 00:08:01.093\nscreen that you have on your computer onto\nsomething much larger like on a wall.\n\n133\n00:08:01.093 --> 00:08:04.531\nAnd especially when you're doing\nPower Point presentations,\n\n134\n00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:08.060\na projector normally becomes a very,\nvery good output device.\n\n135\n00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.260\nOr sometimes we can even\nuse it to watch a movie and\n\n136\n00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.510\nwe're able to see the screen\npresented on a much larger wall.\n\n137\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.850\nSimilarly we have\nthe digital white boards.\n\n138\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.630\nDigital whiteboards use\nthe same kind of concept but\n\n139\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:28.090\nyou connect them directly to the computer\nand then you can see on a screen.\n\n140\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.060\nSo it's almost like the same computer\nscreen that you have here and\n\n141\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:37.110\nthen becomes much larger, same sizes\ntouch screen that you have out there and\n\n142\n00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.710\nthe content now becomes\ndisplayed over there.\n\n143\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.570\nSo they're useful in running\ntraining programs, and\n\n144\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.650\nseminars, and workshops, you know, you can\ngo and stand over there and I'll point to\n\n145\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:54.900\nthe exact screen to show what exactly\nis going on on the computer and\n\n146\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.730\nsometimes you are not bored, you could\nvery easily draw something out there.\n\n147\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.740\nIs that correct?\n\n148\n00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.170\n>> Yes, a lot of times depending on\nthe type of technology that you have,\n\n149\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.000\na regular projector will only shoot\nan image against a screen and\n\n150\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.590\nyour interaction with it is\nnot really an interaction.\n\n151\n00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.010\nYou're essentially overlaying or\n\n152\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.810\nactually writing underneath that if you\nwanted to draw a circle around something\n\n153\n00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.250\nbecause the actual physical screen is\nnot directly connected to the computer.\n\n154\n00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.810\nIf you start talking about\nwhiteboard technology though\n\n155\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.250\nthat also connects you\ninto the computer itself.\n\n156\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.680\nWell we can have a projector that\nprojects itself against a whiteboard but\n\n157\n00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.690\nthe actual whiteboard itself is\nalso connected to the computer, so\n\n158\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.950\nnow what you can do is actually interact\nwith the programs that's being displayed.\n\n159\n00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.290\nSo now that whiteboard\nbecomes both the input\n\n160\n00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.720\nas well as the output\ndevice at the same time.\n\n161\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.320\nAnd it's very strange that we would\nsee that, but some of them do work in\n\n162\n00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.210\ncombination either with a projector that\nprojects the image against the whiteboard\n\n163\n00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.370\nand therefore the whiteboard only\nas a drawing tablet for you.\n\n164\n00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.380\nOr you might actually see where the actual\nwhiteboard itself is a very thin but\n\n165\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.600\nvery hard screen,\n\n166\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.280\njust like an LCD screen, that actually\nallows you to directly interact with it.\n\n167\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.540\nSo normally this is where you\nsee depending on the technology,\n\n168\n00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.050\nmost of the time you might find this\nin a classroom situation more than and\n\n169\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.870\nlet's say the idea of a work office as far\nas you having to deal with it every day.\n\n170\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.710\nIt might find one in it conference room or\n\n171\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.840\nsomebody needs to make their point\nas well, but you don't attempt to\n\n172\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.430\nfind some bodies work station,\nwhere they're working with it day to day.\n\n173\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.340\nCan it be true?\n\n174\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.970\nYes.\nDefinitely that's what you do every day\n\n175\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.570\nsuch as teaching classes.\n\n176\n00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.750\nYou definitely will end\nup using one of these but\n\n177\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.560\nmost of the time you might see\nthem in specialized situations.\n\n178\n00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.330\nMeetings, classrooms you know\nagain maybe a conference room and\n\n179\n00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.520\nthat's the kind of situations\nyou'll tend to find them in.\n\n180\n00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.520\nAnd of course they can range between\nrelatively inexpensive to very expensive\n\n181\n00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.330\ndepending on the technology and\nhow interactive you wanna become with it.\n\n182\n00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.850\nSo I've worked with the very low end\nof it and I've worked with the very\n\n183\n00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.820\nhigh end of it as well, so in both\ncontexts you just have to figure out how\n\n184\n00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.390\nyou're gonna do it and then play around\nin technology until you get it right.\n\n185\n00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.150\n>> Yeah, great.\n\n186\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.740\nNow as we use different\nkinds of output devices\n\n187\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.510\nwe also have to appreciate they\nhave different capabilities.\n\n188\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.740\nOf course, the different forms of usage,\nas we've described them, exist.\n\n189\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.630\nYou can use a projector for\ncertain kind of functions.\n\n190\n00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.950\nYou can use a computer screen for certain\nkind of functions, and so on and so forth.\n\n191\n00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.940\nBut at the same time,\nthere are limitations of output devices.\n\n192\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.950\nYou know,\nthe printers that can print color.\n\n193\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.730\nThe printers that can print only black and\nwhite.\n\n194\n00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.620\nWe'll probably come back\nto those kind of details.\n\n195\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:52.270\nBut just thinking about\nthe display screens alone,\n\n196\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:56.429\nthere is a limitation as to the sharpness\nof the image that you can get.\n\n197\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.020\nWithout distorting things.\n\n198\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.710\nWhen you blow them up,\nhow do they get to look like?\n\n199\n00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.080\nAnd that brings us to\na concept of resolution.\n\n200\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.700\nSo resolution is the number of pixels and\npixels are basically the minutest\n\n201\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:17.340\nelements that you have that can\ndisplay content on a screen.\n\n202\n00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:24.830\nSo the number of pixels give us a sense of\nthe clarity with which we can see objects,\n\n203\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.230\nhow the sizes will turn out\nwhen you move them around, etc.\n\n204\n00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:35.330\nSo resolution is a feature of the screen,\nwhich is the number\n\n205\n00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:41.270\nof pixels that comprise a display with\nthe horizontally end, vertically.\n\n206\n00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:46.630\nSo, each screen has a maximum\nresolution that you can possibly have\n\n207\n00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.680\nand you can set some of these\nproperties on computer.\n\n208\n00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.660\nYou can change the resolution but\nthese are maximum to where you can get.\n\n209\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:02.330\nAnd on the basis of that, then it guides\nyou to how clear your images can become.\n\n210\n00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.630\nAnd therefore,\n\n211\n00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.540\nthey kinda experience you get when\nyou will interact with the computer.\n\n212\n00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.090\n>> And when we start taking a look\nat the idea of what we want and\n\n213\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.810\nwhen we choose a particular type\nof display screen, normally what\n\n214\n00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.670\nwe're talking about is the monitor that we\n>> That we're\n\n215\n00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.030\ngoing to be working with\non day to day basis.\n\n216\n00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.890\nEither our company is gonna choose it for\nus.\n\n217\n00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.040\nNow, as they might have bought 200\nof them and you don't have a choice.\n\n218\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.530\nBut if you do have a choice in selecting\none, you wanna make sure that choice that\n\n219\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.740\nshe understands some of the things that\nyou might need to think about, right.\n\n220\n00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.850\nThe very fact is that there is what we\ncall of course that idea of resolution.\n\n221\n00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.800\nHow many actual of the smallest unit\nthat we can display on the screen and\n\n222\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.320\nyou always want to actually have the\nmaximum number that you can actually have\n\n223\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.730\nin that particular given area.\n\n224\n00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.170\nAnd that gives you\nthe highest quality images.\n\n225\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.530\nAnd the reason why is that each one of\nthose little tiny units is more that you\n\n226\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:59.100\ncan have the finer it is which means\nit gives you more detail because you\n\n227\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.350\ncan have more of those tiny pinholes\nthat allow you to see all that detail.\n\n228\n00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.350\nIf you have less in terms of resolution\nwhen you take a look at it well,\n\n229\n00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.270\nthen that means,\n\n230\n00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.320\neverything will be a little bit grainier\nbecause those actually don't give you as\n\n231\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.530\nmuch detail and you have less number\nof those pixels in between those areas.\n\n232\n00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.720\nSo, you always want to try and\n\n233\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.480\nchoose the highest number that you\nare possibly in the range of affording.\n\n234\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.150\nThe other thing that you might choose, of\ncourse, is the idea of the aspect ratio.\n\n235\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:33.020\nThe traditional format is what we call\nfour by three, which is of course what we\n\n236\n00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.020\nwould normally have seen on an older\ncomputer and even on TV sets.\n\n237\n00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.280\nBut today's TV sets,\n\n238\n00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.510\nif you take a look at them,\nthey generally are of a wider format.\n\n239\n00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.820\nIn other words, the horizontal edge,\n\n240\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.160\njust like you're watching on the bottom\nof the screen here Is a lot wider\n\n241\n00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.190\nthan what you tend to see on\nthe vertical edge instead.\n\n242\n00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.020\nAnd so, when you see something like that,\nthat is what we call an aspect ratio and\n\n243\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.090\nthere's 16 by 9 or there's 4 by 3.\n\n244\n00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.800\nAnd if you're wondering how\nin the world did they come up\n\n245\n00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.170\nwith those particular numbers, well,\n\n246\n00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.760\nthe way that that ends up happening\nis kind of an unusual calculation.\n\n247\n00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.170\nBut they take the number of pixels\nthat can be displayed on the screen.\n\n248\n00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.110\nAnd when they do that,\nthey multiply that top number by 4.\n\n249\n00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.920\nAnd then, when they divide it by 3,\nyou get the bottom number.\n\n250\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.270\nOr, you wanna know if it's 16 by 9,\nyou take the same thing, but\n\n251\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.250\nyou take the number of pixels that they\ntell you it can display when you do that,\n\n252\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.190\nand then you multiply it by 16.\n\n253\n00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.450\nAnd then you divide it by nine and\n\n254\n00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:34.580\nthat lower number should give you\nthe overall resolution as well.\n\n255\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.080\nSo it's a very strange way.\n\n256\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.020\nYou don't have to know all that math but\nif you wanted to actually ever figure out,\n\n257\n00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.570\nand Dr. Tommy's looking at me\nlike do you really know that?\n\n258\n00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.940\nI do and it's just because, I don't know,\nI read that fact at some point and\n\n259\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.540\nI actually tried it and I realized.\n\n260\n00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.630\nBut that way if you really\nwant to determine whether or\n\n261\n00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.890\nnot you actually had that\nsame number of pixels.\n\n262\n00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.940\nOr what the resolution was,\nwhether it was wide screen or not.\n\n263\n00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.605\nThat's how you can actually do that.\n\n264\n00:15:57.605 --> 00:16:01.573\nSo there's a lot of different choices\nthat you have available to you.\n\n265\n00:16:01.573 --> 00:16:02.720\nWhen you start taking a look.\n\n266\n00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.631\nThe other things, of course,\nare things like refresh rate.\n\n267\n00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:09.518\nThe more often that that screen\nessentially refreshes, the brighter and\n\n268\n00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:12.713\nthe crisper that that image is\ngoing to look and, of course,\n\n269\n00:16:12.713 --> 00:16:15.370\neven the amount of color\nthat we can display.\n\n270\n00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.298\nThey call it color depth, as well.\n\n271\n00:16:17.298 --> 00:16:22.470\nMost of them today will display 32 bits of\ncolor, which is about 4 billion possible\n\n272\n00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.950\ngradients of different\ncolors that are out there.\n\n273\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.370\nSo if you only have a monitor\nthat only supports so much,\n\n274\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:33.480\nyou actually are doing full detail, full\nphotography level professional things,\n\n275\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:39.910\nyou want to get the highest\namount of these resolutions and\n\n276\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.680\nof the color depth that you can for\nthe money that you have available to you.\n\n277\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.370\n>> Wow, great.\n\n278\n00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.797\nSo the choices will be made based\non some of those parameters and\n\n279\n00:16:48.797 --> 00:16:52.480\nmaybe that now leads us to\nthinking about printing.\n\n280\n00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.467\nWe buy printers or we use printers.\n\n281\n00:16:55.467 --> 00:16:58.406\nAnd printer is a typical output device,\n\n282\n00:16:58.406 --> 00:17:02.290\na very common output\ndevice in organizations.\n\n283\n00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.080\nAnd we make decisions on printers\nbased on a number of things.\n\n284\n00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.450\nFirst, I tend to think about cost.\n\n285\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:15.100\nWhat will it cost me if I'm gonna\nprocure or hire or purchase a printer?\n\n286\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.610\nSo, the cost of a printer is important.\n\n287\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:20.230\nAnd that cost is normally determined\nby a number of functions.\n\n288\n00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:25.460\nWhich include how many pages\ncan it print per unit time,\n\n289\n00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.780\nor is it color, is it print and\nthings like that.\n\n290\n00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.270\nSecond is what would it cost\nme to print a single page?\n\n291\n00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.771\nNow, we don't get to think so\nmuch about that, but that is important,\n\n292\n00:17:37.771 --> 00:17:42.648\nthinking about what does it actually cost\nto produce one sheet of a print, and\n\n293\n00:17:42.648 --> 00:17:45.292\nalso what resolution can I possibly get?\n\n294\n00:17:45.292 --> 00:17:50.040\nWhat is the quality of images that I\ncan possibly get out of that print.\n\n295\n00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:57.590\nWe talk about the cost of a page,\nwe talk about it as a consumable.\n\n296\n00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:04.710\nWe buy cartridges to input in the printer\nand those cartridges are normally actually\n\n297\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.370\nover time, it becomes more expensive\nto have bought several cartridges,\n\n298\n00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.560\nas opposed to the cost of\nthe actual printer that you bought.\n\n299\n00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.260\nSo, you wanna think about\nwhat is the cost of printing.\n\n300\n00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.560\nA page and then also,\nwhat is the resolution in terms of\n\n301\n00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.550\nthe quality of the kind of\nprint out that you can get?\n\n302\n00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.774\nSometimes if you bring things for\nthe masses,\n\n303\n00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:31.823\nyou really want to print several sheets of\npaper and distribute to people out there,\n\n304\n00:18:31.823 --> 00:18:34.380\nthen you're not too\nworried about resolution.\n\n305\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.090\nYou're not too worried about\nthe quality of the printer.\n\n306\n00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.430\nBut if you're printing something and\nyou're gonna give an executive or\n\n307\n00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.890\nyou're gonna give a business leader\nout there or a sponsor out there and\n\n308\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.180\nyou really care that they see\nsomething really professional,\n\n309\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.320\nthen you care about resolution a lot.\n\n310\n00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.350\nAnd so those are three things that you\nwanna think about when you're trying to\n\n311\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.870\nbuy a printer.\n\n312\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.290\nBut the fourth one is the speed.\n\n313\n00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.340\nHow quickly does it produce?\n\n314\n00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:03.310\nYeah, you can tell me this is the cost\nof printing a sheet of paper but\n\n315\n00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.680\nhow many can I produce\nwithin a period of time?\n\n316\n00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.900\nThat's the speed.\n\n317\n00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.980\nAnd most printers, by the time you\npurchase them, they'll give you those\n\n318\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.480\nguidelines that you can use to make a\ndecision as to which kind of printer would\n\n319\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.220\nyou want to buy based on the kind of\nfunctions that you intend to have.\n\n320\n00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.620\nNow there are different kinds\nof printers as well, and\n\n321\n00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.240\nthe capabilities are different.\n\n322\n00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.840\nSo, we gonna talk a little bit about them,\n\n323\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:35.270\nthink about inkjet printers that\nenable you to print using ink.\n\n324\n00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:39.070\nWe'll talk about laser printers and\n\n325\n00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.368\neach of them have different\nkinda technology behind there.\n\n326\n00:19:42.368 --> 00:19:45.240\nAnd there is no one better to\nexplain to us about this technology.\n\n327\n00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.924\nBecause you seem like you did some\nlittle background of physics.\n\n328\n00:19:47.924 --> 00:19:50.452\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Could you just take a little\n\n329\n00:19:50.452 --> 00:19:56.200\nbit us through the dot matrix printer,\nthe inkjet printer, and the laser printer?\n\n330\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.250\n>> Sure and when you start taking\na look at the idea here of which\n\n331\n00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.370\nprinter to choose and\nwhich one to end up using, well,\n\n332\n00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.850\na lot of times actually it has to do\nwith two different concepts here.\n\n333\n00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.530\nOne actually related to the idea of age.\n\n334\n00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.990\nMost of the time in todays world\nyou do not tend to see what we call\n\n335\n00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.390\nimpact printers.\n\n336\n00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.810\nAnd the reason why is that\nthese things are very noisy and\n\n337\n00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.810\nthey can cause headaches because\nof how noisy they are, and\n\n338\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.390\nthey actually do tend to have a lot\nof paper jams along with them.\n\n339\n00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:27.650\nWhen I was in college, an inkjet\nprinter was just not even considered,\n\n340\n00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.110\nbut the idea of a dot matrix printer or\n\n341\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.580\nan impact printer was pretty\nmuch the one that we had.\n\n342\n00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.650\nIt was as close as we got to\nthe idea of a typewriter, and\n\n343\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.710\nthat's why we tend to use it.\n\n344\n00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:41.660\nIt really did actually make an impact,\nan imprint onto the paper\n\n345\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.150\nitself by moving the ink ribbon\nup as well as a hammer head or\n\n346\n00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.710\nlittle pins that would come out and\nshape the letters that we needed.\n\n347\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.560\nAnd they could operate very quickly or\n\n348\n00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.270\nthey could operate slowly depending on\nthe quality that we wanted to print.\n\n349\n00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.155\nNow the problem that we had with these\nis that they were not what we called\n\n350\n00:20:59.155 --> 00:21:01.390\nsheet-fed types of printers.\n\n351\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.800\nThey relied on this computer paper that\nallowed it to be really fanned out or\n\n352\n00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.620\nribboned out.\n\n353\n00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.490\nSo you bought big boxes of\ncomputer paper that were just\n\n354\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.090\nbarely perforated on each particular edge.\n\n355\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.040\nAnd you would buy a square foot of them so\n\n356\n00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.680\nyou'd have 12 by 12 inches high and\nthen, of course, that deep.\n\n357\n00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.160\nAnd then you would just fan it out and\nyou would, of course, listen to that and\n\n358\n00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.640\nit would be very loud.\n\n359\n00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.740\nSo you don't tend to see\na lot of them anymore.\n\n360\n00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.980\nNow does that mean that they're done?\n\n361\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.090\nNo, if you happen to be working for\n\n362\n00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.600\nan organization that requires\nduplicates or triplicates.\n\n363\n00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:44.040\nHere in the states, we do white copies,\npink copies, and yellow copies.\n\n364\n00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.180\nAnd it impacts one, and\n\n365\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.750\nactually makes the image on three copies,\nyou pull off the pages.\n\n366\n00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.880\nThen I hand a customer the yellow copy.\n\n367\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.920\nI put the pink copy somewhere else and\nI have the original for my records, and\n\n368\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.390\nthat allows me to actually do\ntriplicates or duplicates.\n\n369\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.230\nSo that's where you tend to see them\nis in an industrial environment\n\n370\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.390\nthat really require you\nto keep types of copies.\n\n371\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:11.070\nToday, what you tend to see more often\nis the idea of the inkjet instead,\n\n372\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:15.400\nwhere it's no longer impacting but\nit's spraying ink directly\n\n373\n00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.010\non to the paper itself, but\nvery controlled, letter by letter.\n\n374\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.758\nThe inkjets themselves is like\na spray can of paint, but\n\n375\n00:22:23.758 --> 00:22:28.383\nits nozzle that it's producing,\nif you go ahead and, just don't do\n\n376\n00:22:28.383 --> 00:22:33.243\nthis to waste paper, but all you have to\ndo is type in a period on a paper and\n\n377\n00:22:33.243 --> 00:22:36.070\nthen go to file and\nprint and you see that.\n\n378\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.905\nThat's actually considered\na large spray pattern,\n\n379\n00:22:38.905 --> 00:22:41.740\nis that little tiny period\nthat you see for an inkjet.\n\n380\n00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.025\nAnd you say, large, what do I mean?\n\n381\n00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:46.825\nIt's usually like one-sixteenth of\nthat is actually the spray pattern.\n\n382\n00:22:46.825 --> 00:22:49.225\nSomething like that is\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n383\n00:22:49.225 --> 00:22:52.215\nSo that allows the machine\nto be a lot quieter, but\n\n384\n00:22:52.215 --> 00:22:56.165\neach one of those has to be\nindividual pieces of paper to do so.\n\n385\n00:22:56.165 --> 00:22:59.975\nAnd the only limitation that you have\nthere is of course the cost of the ink,\n\n386\n00:22:59.975 --> 00:23:02.625\nwhich can be costly, like what Dr.\nTonny was saying.\n\n387\n00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:06.330\nOver a period of time, you're gonna\npay off that $100 inkjet printer,\n\n388\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.020\nprobably within a year, and\nthe company that actually sold you that,\n\n389\n00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.790\nif you buy their ink,\n\n390\n00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.900\nthey're gonna make three to four times\nthat because ink is very, very expensive.\n\n391\n00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.240\nYou're gonna pay anywhere 20 to $50 for\n\n392\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.290\na little cartridge of ink\nto help you to continue on.\n\n393\n00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.420\nYou can buy three or four of those\nin a year, you've paid $100 for\n\n394\n00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.090\nthe printer,\nyou're gonna pay $200 for the ink.\n\n395\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.520\nSo it's gonna become more costly.\n\n396\n00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.950\nThe idea of the laser printer,\nthough, uses toner.\n\n397\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:38.280\nAnd in this one, it is a large chemical\nprocess, and an amazing process,\n\n398\n00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.320\nto be able to actually get the pattern\nthat you see on the paper itself.\n\n399\n00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.212\nAnd this is a completely impressive and\n\n400\n00:23:45.212 --> 00:23:49.069\na completely technical process that's\nbeyond what we need to talk about here.\n\n401\n00:23:49.069 --> 00:23:53.795\nBut what we're actually doing\nis we're fusing the idea of that\n\n402\n00:23:53.795 --> 00:23:55.910\ntoner into the paper.\n\n403\n00:23:55.910 --> 00:24:00.201\nSo it's not just laying it on top\nof the paper Like the ink jet.\n\n404\n00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:03.813\nIt is actually the process\nof melting that toner and\n\n405\n00:24:03.813 --> 00:24:09.450\nthen pressing that directly into the paper\nitself to where it becomes one unit.\n\n406\n00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:15.890\nSo when we talk about the idea of fusion\nthat is what laser printing does for you.\n\n407\n00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.268\nAnd then today's laser printing\nyou can do, just like in ink jets,\n\n408\n00:24:19.268 --> 00:24:22.719\nyou can not only do black and white,\nbut you can also do color as well.\n\n409\n00:24:22.719 --> 00:24:26.600\nAnd each one of those processes has its\nparticular application in what you're\n\n410\n00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.963\nactually doing with them.\n\n411\n00:24:27.963 --> 00:24:32.128\nAnd they can range between $50\nto $60 in terms of ink jets,\n\n412\n00:24:32.128 --> 00:24:37.440\nto hundreds to thousands of dollars in\nterms of laser jet or laser printers.\n\n413\n00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.146\nAnd even the tens of thousands of\ndollars depending on what you need here.\n\n414\n00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:44.904\nThe nice thing about all these\ntechnologies is that they really do\n\n415\n00:24:44.904 --> 00:24:46.688\nproduce for you what you need.\n\n416\n00:24:46.688 --> 00:24:49.943\nWhich is taking what's digital\non your screen this time and\n\n417\n00:24:49.943 --> 00:24:52.540\nthen being able to put it on to paper.\n\n418\n00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.870\nWhereas when we talked about\nscanners in our previous episode,\n\n419\n00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.440\nwe're taking what's physical and\ndigitizing it.\n\n420\n00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.550\nA printer actually gives us the other\noutput that we need to see.\n\n421\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.356\nSo it is a long process in\nterms of laser printer,\n\n422\n00:25:03.356 --> 00:25:07.530\nif you wanna learn more about that I\nguarantee you it would take you longer\n\n423\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.801\nthan a couple of days to learn about it.\n\n424\n00:25:09.801 --> 00:25:14.025\nBut it will amaze you in the end when you\nactually do see the entire process of it.\n\n425\n00:25:14.025 --> 00:25:17.910\nIt's six or seven steps,\nI can't remember, and\n\n426\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.380\neach one is technically challenging\nto understand how it actually works.\n\n427\n00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.592\nSo whoever came up with it is a genius.\n\n428\n00:25:24.592 --> 00:25:28.815\nI would never have even thought about the\nprocess of the way that it actually works.\n\n429\n00:25:28.815 --> 00:25:31.395\n>> And that's exactly why I\nasked Ronnie to talk about that.\n\n430\n00:25:31.395 --> 00:25:34.085\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I know he gets fired up about\n\n431\n00:25:34.085 --> 00:25:35.511\nthat kind of subject.\n\n432\n00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:41.942\nThe physics around it, the technology\nbehind it, and that's great, that's great.\n\n433\n00:25:41.942 --> 00:25:46.967\nWe store data and it's a form of output\n\n434\n00:25:46.967 --> 00:25:51.530\nin a way but we don't get to see it.\n\n435\n00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.800\nSo, we can store it in different forms and\n\n436\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.830\nwe do have primary forms of storage and\nsecondary forms of storage.\n\n437\n00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:06.620\nPrimary storage means, but\nthinking about storing in the computer,\n\n438\n00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.540\nas we spoke about the CPU,\nremember, a while back?\n\n439\n00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.970\nSo data comes out of the CPU and\nis being stored in some memory.\n\n440\n00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.090\nSo that form of storage is primary.\n\n441\n00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.372\nAnd if you think about it,\nit's really, really temporary.\n\n442\n00:26:19.372 --> 00:26:23.072\nBecause that memory is designed\nto be used continuously for\n\n443\n00:26:23.072 --> 00:26:26.554\nspecific functions so\nit's gonna be temporary there.\n\n444\n00:26:26.554 --> 00:26:28.358\nAnd then we've got the secondary storage.\n\n445\n00:26:28.358 --> 00:26:32.854\nThe secondary storage now enables us\nto store things for a longer time.\n\n446\n00:26:32.854 --> 00:26:36.824\nWe can decide of course to remove them\ndepending on the kind of memory that\n\n447\n00:26:36.824 --> 00:26:37.354\nwe have.\n\n448\n00:26:37.354 --> 00:26:40.870\nA while back,\nwe used to have disks that are permanent.\n\n449\n00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.980\nOnce you write,\nyou'll never edit it again, that's it.\n\n450\n00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.940\nif you don't like what you wrote,\nthen you just throw it away.\n\n451\n00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.960\nAnd then there are disks\nas well that are reusable.\n\n452\n00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.962\nSo what I'm holding in my hand right now\nis an example of some form of storage.\n\n453\n00:26:56.962 --> 00:27:00.374\nYou can call it flash disk or\nUSB drive, different names,\n\n454\n00:27:00.374 --> 00:27:04.707\npeople used different names, but\ngenerally we do have different types.\n\n455\n00:27:04.707 --> 00:27:09.507\nWe talk about disk drives, we talk about\nDVDs, we talk about flash disks, and\n\n456\n00:27:09.507 --> 00:27:11.857\nall that different forms of storage.\n\n457\n00:27:11.857 --> 00:27:16.390\nBut really how would you\nevaluate a storage device?\n\n458\n00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.070\nIf I listed a few,\nwe'll talk about them in a little while.\n\n459\n00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:25.097\nSo this is an example, some hard disk out\nhere, there is an external hard drive.\n\n460\n00:27:25.097 --> 00:27:28.189\nIt's not too far off from\na flash disk as well but\n\n461\n00:27:28.189 --> 00:27:33.383\nit's just that it can store a lot more,\nuses a slightly different technology.\n\n462\n00:27:33.383 --> 00:27:37.510\nToday I just learned of another\ntechnology, solid state drive.\n\n463\n00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:41.425\nAnd I'll ask Ronnie to explain this one\nbecause I don't know much about it.\n\n464\n00:27:41.425 --> 00:27:45.580\n[LAUGH] So,\nwe've got all manner of different drives.\n\n465\n00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.980\nBut what are we going to use?\n\n466\n00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.470\nWhat criteria we're going to use to make\na decision as to which kind of technology\n\n467\n00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:52.690\nwe're gonna use?\n\n468\n00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.310\nOne is capacity.\n\n469\n00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.830\nAs you can tell,\n\n470\n00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.340\nyou don't expect the capacity of\nthese two devices to be the same.\n\n471\n00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.080\nOne is likely to hold more data,\nor more content, than another.\n\n472\n00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.850\nOf course, let the size not mislead you,\nsometimes you can have a very big device,\n\n473\n00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:10.370\nbut it can only store so much.\n\n474\n00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.240\nAnd you can have a small one\nthat can store a lot more.\n\n475\n00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.715\nSort of every time you're trying\nto procure or obtain a device,\n\n476\n00:28:16.715 --> 00:28:20.490\nyou ask yourself, so what is\nthe capacity of this particular device?\n\n477\n00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.290\nI can see one is written here,\n16 gigabytes.\n\n478\n00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.810\nI'm not very sure exactly what this-\n>> That one's 2 terabytes.\n\n479\n00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.280\n>> This one is 2 terabytes.\n\n480\n00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.965\nWell, now at least size is\nproportional to capacity.\n\n481\n00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:35.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But doesn't always apply, all right?\n\n482\n00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.430\nThe second thing is cost.\n\n483\n00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:41.850\nIt doesn't mean that something\nsmall is necessarily cheaper.\n\n484\n00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.070\nIt can be more expensive.\n\n485\n00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.820\nSo cost would be the second thing,\ncapacity is the first thing.\n\n486\n00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.960\nYou think about the access speed,\nbecause we spoke about random access.\n\n487\n00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.212\nRemember that read only memory?\n\n488\n00:28:52.212 --> 00:28:54.452\nWe spoke about random access memory RAM.\n\n489\n00:28:54.452 --> 00:28:57.910\nSo the speed at which things can\nbe obtained from that document.\n\n490\n00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.860\nSo the technology behind it that enables\nus to determine the speed at which we can\n\n491\n00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.490\naccess documents or\ncontent is a parameter.\n\n492\n00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.460\nAnother thing we want to\nthink about is the interface.\n\n493\n00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.520\nIf you carefully look at\nsome of these devices,\n\n494\n00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.320\nthey've got certain kinds of interfaces.\n\n495\n00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.810\nWhich is the mechanism with which this\ndevice interacts with another device.\n\n496\n00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:24.532\nSo depending on the technology that is\nused, it can actually determine the speed.\n\n497\n00:29:24.532 --> 00:29:28.370\nIt can actually determine the capacity,\nwhat can you move.\n\n498\n00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.690\nSo if for example, I was moving around\nsome video clips that are large,\n\n499\n00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.380\nit would be a different experience than\nif I was doing a simple Word document.\n\n500\n00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.000\nSo the technology that\nis used is important.\n\n501\n00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.950\nWhat media type?\n\n502\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:46.820\nFor example, what is in this technology is\ndifferent from this technology certainly.\n\n503\n00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.893\nSo what is a media type or what is\nthe technology that is used for storing?\n\n504\n00:29:50.893 --> 00:29:56.014\nThink about it, we used to have tapes,\na while back, they're not as common now.\n\n505\n00:29:56.014 --> 00:30:02.200\nWe used to have magnetic tapes, we used to\nhave optical technology that is different.\n\n506\n00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.058\nAnd each of these technologies have\ndifferent capabilities and strengths.\n\n507\n00:30:06.058 --> 00:30:10.710\nPortability, the ease with which you carry\nthis if you wanted to carry it is not\n\n508\n00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:15.840\ngonna be the same as the ease\nwith which you'll carry this one.\n\n509\n00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.910\nWill you be able to connect remotely?\n\n510\n00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.490\nWill you be able to move it around?\n\n511\n00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.172\nAnd things like that.\n\n512\n00:30:20.172 --> 00:30:25.128\nThose are parameters you want to think\nabout as you decide what storage\n\n513\n00:30:25.128 --> 00:30:26.815\ndevice you want to use.\n\n514\n00:30:26.815 --> 00:30:29.199\nIn terms of storage internally,\n\n515\n00:30:29.199 --> 00:30:34.570\nwe spoke about different data types\nsome time back in a different episode.\n\n516\n00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.570\nWe have files, and\nfiles are of different types.\n\n517\n00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:44.125\nSo, inside this device you'll probably\nget several folders in there and\n\n518\n00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:47.390\nthose folders will have\ndifferent documents inside.\n\n519\n00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:52.440\nYou can organize the folders, create the\nfolders, insert, move things around and\n\n520\n00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.410\neach of them now will have a path.\n\n521\n00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.630\nThat defines the folders and\nall the way to the particular device, and\n\n522\n00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:00.020\nhow it's stored.\n\n523\n00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.130\nNow the volume of the device is what\nwill determine how much content can you\n\n524\n00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.460\nactually put in there.\n\n525\n00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.990\nAnd that's a decision that you have to\nmake when you're making a purchase.\n\n526\n00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.903\nBut think about a typical folder,\nlike a cabinet.\n\n527\n00:31:13.903 --> 00:31:17.636\nThe way we organize things in a cabinet\nand we have folders in there,\n\n528\n00:31:17.636 --> 00:31:22.100\nit's the same logic that we use to\nstore things in this kind of a device.\n\n529\n00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.836\nSo they're different kind of things, and\n\n530\n00:31:24.836 --> 00:31:29.405\nyou have to make decisions as to what\ndo you want to use, when, and why?\n\n531\n00:31:29.405 --> 00:31:32.122\nThat different technologies\nthat we could go into,\n\n532\n00:31:32.122 --> 00:31:34.356\nyou have an opportunity to study further.\n\n533\n00:31:34.356 --> 00:31:39.427\nAnd of course, our great expert\nhere on physics of technology\n\n534\n00:31:39.427 --> 00:31:44.204\nwho will also gives us some\nthoughts as we get into a close,\n\n535\n00:31:44.204 --> 00:31:47.760\nbecause our time is as well limited.\n\n536\n00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.179\nOf course you can store\nthings in a network.\n\n537\n00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:54.741\nYou don't always have to store in\na physical computer or in a device,\n\n538\n00:31:54.741 --> 00:31:56.641\nexternal device like this.\n\n539\n00:31:56.641 --> 00:32:01.419\nIf your computer's connected to other\ncomputers, you can also store in a server,\n\n540\n00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:04.060\nyou can store in another computer.\n\n541\n00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.800\nAnd most recently, now there's a capacity\nto store things on the internet.\n\n542\n00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.200\nSo you can actually store in\na remote computer somewhere\n\n543\n00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.070\nwhich you don't even have\naccess to physically.\n\n544\n00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:19.180\nAnd you can purchase that space and\nstore, and\n\n545\n00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.600\nyou can actually access\nthat resource on demand.\n\n546\n00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.850\nLike if you want to increase the storage,\nyou can request for more space.\n\n547\n00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.460\nThat's called cloud technology.\n\n548\n00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.526\nWhile it's some great,\n\n549\n00:32:29.526 --> 00:32:32.535\ngreat technology that we don't want\nto get ourselves into right now.\n\n550\n00:32:32.535 --> 00:32:36.170\nBut the point is that you\ncan store things elsewhere.\n\n551\n00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:40.210\nYou don't have to store them physically on\nyour computer or in a device like this.\n\n552\n00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:44.740\nThink about sensitive content, sometimes\nyou might think that it is safer to have\n\n553\n00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.950\nthis thing in your own flash disk or\nin your own computer.\n\n554\n00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:51.760\nBut based on how technology has evolved,\nit might actually not be as wise.\n\n555\n00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.820\nYou might even have yourself\nstore this thing elsewhere.\n\n556\n00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.500\nSometimes, we think that when\nyou have something physical,\n\n557\n00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.740\nyou'll access through your server or\nthe room where your things are stored.\n\n558\n00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.210\nThat's necessarily an advantage and\nyou have more control.\n\n559\n00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:12.420\nBut with the age of internet connectivity,\npeople can access your resources remotely.\n\n560\n00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.499\nSo sometimes, you're probably\nbetter off giving someone else\n\n561\n00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.970\nthe leeway to store for\nyou based on a certain criteria,\n\n562\n00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.490\ncertain set of guidelines,\ncertain set of agreements.\n\n563\n00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.940\nThe same we take content to,\nwe take money to the bank.\n\n564\n00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.520\nThe other day,\nI was asking my little friend out there,\n\n565\n00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.940\nsaying I wanna take money to the bank,\nwould you let me go?\n\n566\n00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:35.690\nHe said no, no, no.\n\n567\n00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.632\nBut I can keep for you under the mattress.\n\n568\n00:33:37.632 --> 00:33:38.729\nYou know, I'll watch over it.\n\n569\n00:33:38.729 --> 00:33:41.701\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But you know,\n\n570\n00:33:41.701 --> 00:33:46.250\nbanks are designed with all\nthe security mechanism in place.\n\n571\n00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:50.280\nI get into an agreement with them,\nthey keep for me the money.\n\n572\n00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.030\nAnd I don't have to spend my\neffort trying to keep money.\n\n573\n00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.150\nI can go look for the money, and\nthen I come and keep over there.\n\n574\n00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.307\nSame way,\nwe can store data in other places, and\n\n575\n00:33:59.307 --> 00:34:02.830\nthen we get into agreement with\nwhoever is storing for us.\n\n576\n00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:07.200\nAnd it can be just as safe or\neven safer than if we store it ourselves.\n\n577\n00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.960\nRonnie, I'm sure you have some thoughts.\n\n578\n00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.538\nA little bit of physics, I know.\n\n579\n00:34:11.538 --> 00:34:13.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Has to come to\n\n580\n00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.360\nconclusion on this session.\n\n581\n00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.030\n>> Well, when we start taking a look here,\nit really does\n\n582\n00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:22.930\ndepend on the function that you need those\nparticular types of storage devices for.\n\n583\n00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:25.870\nIf you know that you're gonna be\nreplacing a failed hard drive.\n\n584\n00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.770\nWell, then it normally is that\nyou're gonna go ahead and\n\n585\n00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:31.440\nreplace it with another drive\nthat is of the same capacity or\n\n586\n00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.340\ngreater capacity, but\nprobably the same type.\n\n587\n00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.430\nThe key here of course is gonna\nbe matching on the interface.\n\n588\n00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:39.830\nThe connectors that actually\nhave to go do that, and\n\n589\n00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.070\nof course actually making sure you have\nat least that same amount of storage.\n\n590\n00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:47.202\nBut if your goal of course is going\nto be the idea of portability.\n\n591\n00:34:47.202 --> 00:34:51.809\nWell, you might wanna choose those that\nactually allow you to connect using USB or\n\n592\n00:34:51.809 --> 00:34:57.070\nagain, even the idea of that smaller type\nof USB drive that we were talking about.\n\n593\n00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:59.635\nNow, if your goal though is performance,\n\n594\n00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:03.927\nyou would normally choose solid state\nover a conventional hard drive.\n\n595\n00:35:03.927 --> 00:35:06.413\nYou may be wondering why,\nwell, one is mechanical and\n\n596\n00:35:06.413 --> 00:35:09.690\nthat means that it really has to\nspin something for it to work.\n\n597\n00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:13.085\nThe other one is electronic, the solid\nstate doesn't have to move anything.\n\n598\n00:35:13.085 --> 00:35:15.344\nIt moves all the data electronically,\n\n599\n00:35:15.344 --> 00:35:18.835\nwhich is gonna be much faster than\nhaving to spin up a drive and\n\n600\n00:35:18.835 --> 00:35:22.500\nlocate it physically on some\nlocation on a drive here.\n\n601\n00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.630\nSo when you take all of\nthat into consideration,\n\n602\n00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:29.230\nthat is what you're taking a look at when\nyou're choosing some type of storage.\n\n603\n00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.890\nEverybody's gonna choose it\nbased on a different need.\n\n604\n00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.800\nFor me right now,\nmy need is actually two things.\n\n605\n00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.800\nIt's the overall storage, in other words,\nI need greater storage and\n\n606\n00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.370\nthe idea of access speeds.\n\n607\n00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:46.090\nBut at the same time, I know I\nhave a limitation on my laptop, so\n\n608\n00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:51.760\nI went with an external USB drive\nthat was very similar to this one.\n\n609\n00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.950\nIt gave the great capacity\nof two terabytes.\n\n610\n00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:59.400\nBecause of the standard that is used\nhere on this connection, called USB 3.\n\n611\n00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.380\nIt allows me to transfer data very,\n\n612\n00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.590\nvery quickly between this device and\nmy computer.\n\n613\n00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:09.480\nAnd so, that's why I ended\nup choosing this instead,\n\n614\n00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.430\nto give me something when I might have\nbeen able to choose something like this,\n\n615\n00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:19.220\nwhich is a solid state drive, but\nit has a limited capacity instead.\n\n616\n00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.340\nSo everybody will always\nmake those decisions.\n\n617\n00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.220\nWhat you need to do is\nfigure out what you need,\n\n618\n00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:28.310\nand that is pretty much the key to taking\na look at the idea of input devices.\n\n619\n00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:32.188\nAnd of course, most of us are also going\nto be limited by the idea of cost as well.\n\n620\n00:36:32.188 --> 00:36:32.758\nBut Dr.\n\n621\n00:36:32.758 --> 00:36:37.820\nTonny, that looks like it's a great\nplace for us to also stop right here.\n\n622\n00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.510\nThere's a lot more technology of course,\nwe can talk about.\n\n623\n00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.736\nBut overall, though,\nit's a good introduction, I believe.\n\n624\n00:36:43.736 --> 00:36:48.481\n>> Absolutely, it's a great introduction,\nand gives you broadly the various\n\n625\n00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:52.960\nelements, the relationships,\nthen you can make decisions.\n\n626\n00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.542\nAnd when you come across these devices,\nyou know what they are for, and\n\n627\n00:36:56.542 --> 00:36:57.865\nwhich one can you choose.\n\n628\n00:36:57.865 --> 00:37:00.690\nAnd how do you make the choice\nabout which one to obtain?\n\n629\n00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.935\nIf you're making a purchase,\nhow do you go about that?\n\n630\n00:37:03.935 --> 00:37:07.235\nWhat can you use to make a presentation,\n\n631\n00:37:07.235 --> 00:37:11.435\nwhat can you use to get\ncontent onto the computer?\n\n632\n00:37:11.435 --> 00:37:15.205\nThat gives an idea and we hope you will\nspend a little more time to understand.\n\n633\n00:37:15.205 --> 00:37:18.715\nAs we use these things more,\nwe become more and more familiar.\n\n634\n00:37:18.715 --> 00:37:22.845\nAnd we build our capacity and strength,\nand our ability to make good decisions.\n\n635\n00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:25.850\n>> All right then,\nwell that's a great place for\n\n636\n00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:27.630\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n637\n00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.667\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n638\n00:37:31.667 --> 00:37:33.657\n>> And my name is Dr. Tonny

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:10.040\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:15.199\nWelcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.168\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and you're\nwatching the Computing Fundamentals IC3\n\n4\n00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:24.470\nshow, where we're about to get into\nthe idea of operating systems.\n\n5\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.450\nWe've already talked a bit about the\nsystem unit itself, and also the basics of\n\n6\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.020\ninformation systems, but now we're\nactually heading into, of course,\n\n7\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.800\nthen that interface that we've been\ntalking about in those previous episodes.\n\n8\n00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.136\nAnd here to help us to understand\nthat a bit better is going to\n\n9\n00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.580\nbe Dr Tonny Omwansa.\n\n10\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.180\nDr Omwansa, welcome back.\n\n11\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.310\n>> Thank you very much for having me.\n\n12\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.830\nIt's great to have a moment to\nthink about operating systems.\n\n13\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.904\nAnd we've been talking about\ndifferent things in the computer, and\n\n14\n00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:53.790\nthe opportunity to talk about\noperating system is really exciting.\n\n15\n00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.900\n>> It really is an exciting concept for\nus,\n\n16\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.830\nbecause a lot of times when we end up\nbuying a computer in the very first place\n\n17\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.750\nwe only think about the idea\nof the hardware that we buy.\n\n18\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.380\nThe computer monitor itself and\nthe system unit, the keyboard and\n\n19\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.842\nthe mouse, but all of those devices,\neven when you put them all together,\n\n20\n00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:16.110\nDr Tonny, without an operating system,\n\n21\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.260\nis it really any better than just\na rock that's sitting on my desk?\n\n22\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.601\n>> That's a little bit harsh.\n\n23\n00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:26.520\nJust a little bit harsh, but\nit's so true because you\n\n24\n00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.940\nare hardly going to do anything\nwith just a computer hardware.\n\n25\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.280\nIt may have been configured very nicely,\nlooks very nice,\n\n26\n00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.420\nbut you're hardly going to do anything\nwith it because it takes instructions.\n\n27\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.850\nInstructions are structured\nin a certain way.\n\n28\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.840\nYou just can't speak to the computer and\nexpect it to do something.\n\n29\n00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.880\nSo that's one of the functions\nof the operating system.\n\n30\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.250\nSo we're gonna talk about\nsystem software generally.\n\n31\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.490\nIt's that kind of software that's able\nto communicate with the hardware.\n\n32\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.550\nSo that's the power.\n\n33\n00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.580\nI mean, we interact with applications, but\nthe applications don't directly interact\n\n34\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.408\nwith the hardware, right in between\nthere is the system software.\n\n35\n00:02:06.408 --> 00:02:07.130\n>> So Dr Tonny,\n\n36\n00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.810\nwhen we begin to take a look then at the\noverall working of the computer system,\n\n37\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.180\nwe've got to understand that it does\nbegin with the idea of hardware.\n\n38\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.370\nBut then we have something in which allows\nus to be able to do that integration and\n\n39\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.290\nthat is where we are going\nto start today and\n\n40\n00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.220\ntaking a look at some of\nthe different components.\n\n41\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.085\nSo Dr Tonny,\nwhere are we gonna begin today?\n\n42\n00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:27.960\n>> We'll begin with an outline.\n\n43\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.720\nI think it's important that we know what\n\n44\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.010\nis the general partition\nsystem space cover.\n\n45\n00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.020\nWhat would we focus on in that area.\n\n46\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.111\nThe first thing is to try and\nunderstand what are operating systems?\n\n47\n00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:41.850\nHow does an operating system work,\nall right?\n\n48\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.546\nWhat is this function, and what types of\noperating systems potentially exist and\n\n49\n00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:49.879\nmaybe what are some of\nthe differences that are there, and\n\n50\n00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.799\nthen we'll talk about drivers.\n\n51\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.322\nWe'll talk about somebody driving a car,\nsame time, but used differently here.\n\n52\n00:02:57.322 --> 00:02:58.720\nWe'll talk about drivers and\n\n53\n00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.530\nthen we think about how do the files\nget organized within a computer?\n\n54\n00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.860\nIt's a file system.\n\n55\n00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.060\nSo that's roughly what we're\ngonna be talking about.\n\n56\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.400\nAnd so to hit the road and\n\n57\n00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.950\nget talking about these things, let's\nstart talking about the system software.\n\n58\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.520\nSo like I said earlier,\nthe hardware is just some pieces.\n\n59\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.400\nMetallic and whatever form they'll be.\n\n60\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.200\nAnd for\nus to communicate with that hardware,\n\n61\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.120\nwe need a language that\nhardware will understand.\n\n62\n00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.100\nAnd one language is hidden\nin the operating system, or\n\n63\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.080\nthe system software for that matter.\n\n64\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.420\nBut there are many different\nkinds of system software.\n\n65\n00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.604\nWe've got the software,\nwhenever you turn on a computer,\n\n66\n00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:41.535\nsome software is pre-installed\nin the computer, and\n\n67\n00:03:41.535 --> 00:03:45.132\nit's function is to check whoa,\nwhoa, wait is everything fine?\n\n68\n00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:48.630\nAre all the devices functioning?\n\n69\n00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.150\nDo we have the operating system in place?\n\n70\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.900\nIs power supply sufficient?\n\n71\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.860\nAnd things like that.\n\n72\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.160\nAnd we call that the BIOS, and for\nme it's a very powerful tool because\n\n73\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.860\neven when you wake up in the morning, you\ndon't just shoot and start running, right?\n\n74\n00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.770\nYou kinda like get up and\nlet the system start adjusting.\n\n75\n00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.300\nAnd the body has a mechanism of trying\nto find out is there any problem?\n\n76\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.115\nIs your hand there?\n\n77\n00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:20.220\n[LAUGH] And then after that,\nthen the BIOS does\n\n78\n00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.680\na basic check, and so for us we're not\ngonna worry about the specific of BIOS,\n\n79\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.910\nand how it's designed, and how it works.\n\n80\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.690\nAt least get to know that when the\ncomputer starts, the BIOS does its thing.\n\n81\n00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.227\nAnd then after that,\nthe operating system is going to take off.\n\n82\n00:04:34.227 --> 00:04:36.570\nThe operating system will\nhave several functions.\n\n83\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.570\nOne is that it will actually\nbe your interface with\n\n84\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.960\ninteracting with the computer.\n\n85\n00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.150\nBy interface, if you look at my hand,\non one side, it's a little different.\n\n86\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.040\nAnd from this side,\nit's a little different.\n\n87\n00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.627\nSo as an interface,\nit's basically enables you to\n\n88\n00:04:51.627 --> 00:04:55.160\ninteract in the language that\nyou understand from this side.\n\n89\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.200\nBut on this side,\nyou really don't want to know,\n\n90\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.220\nbecause its another language that\nthe hardware is going to understand.\n\n91\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.213\nSo everything that you get to\ndo is done on this side, and\n\n92\n00:05:03.213 --> 00:05:07.420\nthen the operating system has mechanism\nof converting what you are trying to do\n\n93\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.060\ninto the language that\nhardware understands.\n\n94\n00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.900\nAll right, that's one important thing.\n\n95\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.270\nSo that is an interface.\n\n96\n00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.160\nThe second thing is that the operating\nsystem is on it is going to run\n\n97\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.480\napplications.\n\n98\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.850\nSo every time you make a request,\nI want to run Microsoft Word.\n\n99\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.320\nMicrosoft Word is an application, but\nit is the operating system that gets you\n\n100\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.950\nthat application, picks whatever\nneeds to be picked from memory, and\n\n101\n00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.240\nthen give it to you,\nand then you interact.\n\n102\n00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.440\nThe other thing the operating system is\ngoing to do is that it's going to run for\n\n103\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.500\nyou the files.\n\n104\n00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.890\nIt's going to manage for you the files.\n\n105\n00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.270\nWhenever you organize files and\n\n106\n00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.810\nmove things from one place to another,\nthat's up to the operating system to think\n\n107\n00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.960\nabout how does that now translate\ninto the lowest level of memory.\n\n108\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.330\nHow are those documents\ngoing to be organized?\n\n109\n00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.960\nYou don't want to know about that.\n\n110\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.850\nYou just need to know that there's a path.\n\n111\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.270\nI can easily trace a document.\n\n112\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.130\nAlso, see the operating\nsystem as a mechanism\n\n113\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.650\nof communicating with other hardware.\n\n114\n00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.870\nIf you have a printer or\nyou have a scanner or\n\n115\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.720\nyou have a camera or\nyou have a joystick or\n\n116\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.530\na mouse or whatever it may be, it's up to\nyour operating system to communicate to\n\n117\n00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.520\nthose things as output devices, as well as\nthe input devices that you may be using.\n\n118\n00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.890\nThat's roughly what the operating\nsystem is going to do for you.\n\n119\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:28.170\nAnd the different kinds of interactions\nthat you will have for operating systems.\n\n120\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.560\nThere are operating systems that\nuse a graphical user interface.\n\n121\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.810\nThat simply means, it's designed in\na manner that you can easily visualize.\n\n122\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.400\nYou can actually press things.\n\n123\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.490\nIt's an interface that you\ncan relate with very easily.\n\n124\n00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.790\nWhen you say I'm gonna press a button.\n\n125\n00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.870\nOr I'm going to move a mouse or I'm going\nto type on a textbook or you've got\n\n126\n00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.550\nsurface area or radio button or\na combo box, whatever it may be.\n\n127\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.470\nThere are things that\nyou can really see and\n\n128\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.156\nyou can almost predict what they are for,\nthat's a graphical user interface.\n\n129\n00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:07.280\nAnd the likes of Windows,\nwhich we're going to be talking about,\n\n130\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.970\ndifferent versions of\nWindows have that capacity.\n\n131\n00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.860\nThen there's the other option where\nyou use a command line interface.\n\n132\n00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.730\nSometimes you may have gone into a room\nand find these people typing and\n\n133\n00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.310\nyou see a long line, and they press Enter,\nand then something happens.\n\n134\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.990\nThat's more command based.\n\n135\n00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.430\nThat means,\nyou must know what the commands are.\n\n136\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.260\nYou must know the instruction\nas they pass in typing.\n\n137\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.510\nAnd then if you type in mistake,\nthe computer will always tell you,\n\n138\n00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.940\nno I don't understand what you're saying.\n\n139\n00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.050\nThere's a difference of\none single character, or\n\n140\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.900\na dot, or whatever it may be\nwill have an imprecations.\n\n141\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.620\nSo the computer will not be able to\ntake those instructions as you expected.\n\n142\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.460\nSo you must then really,\nreally memorize and\n\n143\n00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.360\nunderstand how to construct those\ncommands, those kind of instructions.\n\n144\n00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.864\nSo that's the general layout\nof our operating systems.\n\n145\n00:07:49.864 --> 00:07:54.708\nSo in a little while, we'll go into what\ntype of operating systems exist out there,\n\n146\n00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:56.701\nand what are their capabilities?\n\n147\n00:07:56.701 --> 00:07:57.607\nAll right.\n\n148\n00:07:57.607 --> 00:08:01.838\nSo, Dr. Tonny, now that we understand at\nleast the basics of the operating systems\n\n149\n00:08:01.838 --> 00:08:04.850\nthat we really are gonna see\nreally two generic types.\n\n150\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.152\nThere's gonna be what we call\nthat graphical user interface.\n\n151\n00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:11.368\nThis is where we can use a mouse as\nwell as the information that we see on\n\n152\n00:08:11.368 --> 00:08:13.332\nthe screen to point and click and\n\n153\n00:08:13.332 --> 00:08:17.470\nallow us to actually run\ncommands in the operating system.\n\n154\n00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.450\nNormally, we might do something like this\nif we are, of course, working inside,\n\n155\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.870\nlet's say, an application, and\nwe wanna print that application.\n\n156\n00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.980\nBeing able to move the mouse\nup to a certain location,\n\n157\n00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.960\nand then finding the word print allows\nus to actually be able to do that.\n\n158\n00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.110\nOr, we're actually gonna have what\nwe call a command line interface.\n\n159\n00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:41.670\nSometimes you hear the abbreviation CLI,\nfor Command Line Interface.\n\n160\n00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.630\nAnd this is where you must know and\n\n161\n00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.880\ntype in those commands to be able to get\nthe computer system, the operating system\n\n162\n00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.700\nto do the commands that you really\nwant to actually be able to know.\n\n163\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.880\nAlso, you wanna make sure that\nyou understand that idea and\n\n164\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.950\nthat concept, that the operating system\nis that human interface side, where\n\n165\n00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.500\nit allows you to communicate not only with\nthe hardware by sending the commands to\n\n166\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.520\nthe operating system then the operating\nsystem interpreting that to the hardware.\n\n167\n00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.900\nBut also it does it with the applications,\nand\n\n168\n00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.390\nthen helps you to manage all the files in\na file system way, so that they can be\n\n169\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.780\neasily retrieved, regardless of\nwhat application you're running in.\n\n170\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.660\nNow, even so, we tend to actually\ndeal with applications on\n\n171\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.637\nan interface way as far as what we do.\n\n172\n00:09:24.637 --> 00:09:28.034\nA lot of times, productivity software and\nentertainment software, you and\n\n173\n00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:31.550\nI directly interact with that instead\nof the operating system itself.\n\n174\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.104\nBut there are other utilities that\nare also built into the operating system.\n\n175\n00:09:35.104 --> 00:09:38.810\nDr. Tonny, what do we have to understand\nabout these types of utilities?\n\n176\n00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.645\n>> Well, as you rightfully say,\n\n177\n00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:44.220\nthe system software is more\nthan just the operating system.\n\n178\n00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.470\nWe spoke about the BIOS before.\n\n179\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.478\nThe BIOS, and then now we've\nspoken about the operating system.\n\n180\n00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:53.405\nAnd lastly, we've got a lot of\nother utilities, applications,\n\n181\n00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:56.840\nwhich are also part of\nthe system's software.\n\n182\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.570\nThey get to interact with\nthe hardware in certain way.\n\n183\n00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.710\nYou know, think about it.\n\n184\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.550\nYou have viruses.\n\n185\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.340\nYou've heard of them.\n\n186\n00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.030\nRight?\nSo,\n\n187\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.150\nyou need some software that is basically\ngoing to try and clear those viruses.\n\n188\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.330\nSo, you may have heard of malware,\nor you've heard of spyware.\n\n189\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:18.270\nOr, you've heard of hardware\nthat's software that is used to\n\n190\n00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:23.760\nclean up and remove all those kind of\ndangerous software that is in the system.\n\n191\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.900\nYou may have heard of the tools\nthat compress documents and\n\n192\n00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.833\nmake them become a little smaller.\n\n193\n00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:31.313\nSo we consider those to\nbe utility software or\n\n194\n00:10:31.313 --> 00:10:34.000\nsometimes your hard disk\nmay have some problem.\n\n195\n00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.460\nSomething is to be able to\ncheck you high disk for errors,\n\n196\n00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:44.610\nyou know, or maybe now things are a little\nscattered on the hard disk and\n\n197\n00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.420\nsomehow it needs to be a little organized.\n\n198\n00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.360\nThere is some software that can do that,\nand we classify as utility software.\n\n199\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.590\nSometimes you may want\nto install something, or\n\n200\n00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.930\nyou want to uninstall something.\n\n201\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.851\nOr you know there are some software\nthat needs to check on registrar and\n\n202\n00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:03.970\nremember when we spoke about registry\nwhen we are talking about the CPU and\n\n203\n00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.050\nthings like that.\n\n204\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:09.030\nSo the softwares that are able to\nreach down to the hardware and\n\n205\n00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:14.040\nmake some kind of, provide some kind\nof services for the benefit of your\n\n206\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.570\ncomputer so that your computer functions\nmore effectively is utility software.\n\n207\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.120\nAnd there's a range of utility\nsoftware and we will get into that.\n\n208\n00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.370\nTypically, they are very simple,\n\n209\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:29.360\nsmall software that you are probably\ngoing to use directly or indirectly.\n\n210\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.610\nSo we now have two types,\nbasically, of operating system.\n\n211\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.660\nYou can, well, not necessarily two,\n\n212\n00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.890\nbut there are different\ntypes of operating systems.\n\n213\n00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.320\nSo we're gonna try and\ngive you a few examples.\n\n214\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.530\nAnd examples are many, but\n\n215\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.080\nwe'll give you some of those that\nyou probably will relate to.\n\n216\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.910\nWhen you think about a mobile phone,\nwe say that it is actually a computer.\n\n217\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.230\nIt is running on some\nkind of operating system.\n\n218\n00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.380\nIf you think about a laptop, it's running\non some kind of operating system.\n\n219\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.090\nWhen you think about a server, it's\nrunning on some kind of operating system.\n\n220\n00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.446\nNow logically then,\n\n221\n00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:13.493\nit therefore means that this software\nthat is classified as operating system in\n\n222\n00:12:13.493 --> 00:12:18.483\nthe server's piece couldn't be the one\nthat also runs a mobile application.\n\n223\n00:12:18.483 --> 00:12:19.551\nHow will you think about it?\n\n224\n00:12:19.551 --> 00:12:22.825\nMobile phones are likely to be very small,\nlight,\n\n225\n00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:28.020\nthey don't need a lot of storage and\na lot of power compared to a server.\n\n226\n00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.480\nSo we've got different kinds\nof operating system that play,\n\n227\n00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.810\nthat are used in different label.\n\n228\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:39.740\nSo every time you hear like, Windows\noperating system, or you hear, Android,\n\n229\n00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:45.390\nor you hear, Windows 7, or\nyou hear, Linux, or you hear UNIX.\n\n230\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.210\nThose are different types\nof operating systems and\n\n231\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.060\nthey're used at different levels.\n\n232\n00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.640\nSo, maybe Ronnie you may\nwanna just run around and\n\n233\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.840\ngive us a sense of which\noperating system is used where.\n\n234\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.370\n>> Yeah.\n\n235\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.550\nSo when we start taking a look here at\nsome of the different operating systems,\n\n236\n00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.770\nwe normally do, divide it up into well\nsome of the different categories and Dr.\n\n237\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.550\nOmwansa gave us some of these.\n\n238\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.489\nWhen you are taking a look at\na smartphone, you know the ones that you\n\n239\n00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:12.810\nhave, it might be running some\ntype of Android operating system.\n\n240\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.180\nThey name all of theirs after sweets Dr.\nOmwansa for one reason or another.\n\n241\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.080\nThe version on my smartphone right\nnow is one that's called Marshmallow,\n\n242\n00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.290\ndon't know why, but that's the version\nthat they call, and it's a very streamline\n\n243\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.730\noperating system designed to run\nnot full sized applications that we\n\n244\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.950\nwould normally see on a desktop, but just\nenough so that it can actually run and\n\n245\n00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.400\ngive me the utility that I need\nto see on the phone itself.\n\n246\n00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.026\nAnd, we also, of course,\nhave the more popular phone that's out\n\n247\n00:13:45.026 --> 00:13:50.630\nthere on the world today,\nI would assume would be the Apple iPhone.\n\n248\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.060\nThey also run an operating\nsystem called the IOS and\n\n249\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.400\ntheir particular operating system\nhas a lot of buttons on them\n\n250\n00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.090\nthat allow them to run those applications\ntoo, that are very light weight.\n\n251\n00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.690\nBut they do not have full features that we\nwould normally see on a regular desktop\n\n252\n00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:10.130\noperating system or laptop or\na notebook operating system.\n\n253\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:15.532\nIn those systems we do tend to see what we\nnormally call of course, home computing or\n\n254\n00:14:15.532 --> 00:14:19.950\ndesktop environment type of\noperating systems, like Windows 7.\n\n255\n00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.750\nOr, you might hear Windows 8.1, and\neven in today's world, Windows 10.\n\n256\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.010\nThose are designed for the home user.\n\n257\n00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.030\nThey are designed for\nthe individual work station.\n\n258\n00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.440\nThe same thing if you happen\nto be running a Macbook,\n\n259\n00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.243\nyou might hear their particular ones too.\n\n260\n00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:38.422\nThey call it OSX at this point and\n\n261\n00:14:38.422 --> 00:14:43.080\nthey of course have different\nnames named after mountains.\n\n262\n00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.630\nEl Capitan and\nYosemite as far as the park goes,\n\n263\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.560\nyou name it there are several of\nthem out there for Macbooks too.\n\n264\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.172\nAnd then, of course there\nare hundreds of varieties of Linux or\n\n265\n00:14:54.172 --> 00:14:58.120\nLinux operating systems that\nare also out there, as well.\n\n266\n00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.380\nNow, the unusual thing of course then,\nis that those are designed for one user\n\n267\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.510\nto be able to interact with that computer,\nand to be able to use that computer.\n\n268\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.560\nBut they are not designed for\n\n269\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.790\nmultiple people to connect and\nhave service at the same time\n\n270\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.190\nis really about that one to one\nrelationship that we have with a computer.\n\n271\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.520\nWhen you start talking about\nthe world of servers then,\n\n272\n00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.655\nthat are designed for multiple people\nto get the services that they need,\n\n273\n00:15:23.655 --> 00:15:27.995\nthis is when you start moving into\nthe arena of server operating systems.\n\n274\n00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:34.137\nAnd this is where you hear the terms\nlike Windows Server 2008 or\n\n275\n00:15:34.137 --> 00:15:36.666\nWindows Server 2012.\n\n276\n00:15:36.666 --> 00:15:38.498\nAnd you start hearing even more of these.\n\n277\n00:15:38.498 --> 00:15:41.864\nThese are actually designed for\na different level, usually for\n\n278\n00:15:41.864 --> 00:15:44.915\na company to be able to run\nthings like email servers and web\n\n279\n00:15:44.915 --> 00:15:49.296\nservers in which multiple people are going\nto connect to those and get what we need.\n\n280\n00:15:49.296 --> 00:15:54.195\nSo every type of operating system that\nwe talk about Really helps the user\n\n281\n00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:57.004\nto get what they need\nout of that system and\n\n282\n00:15:57.004 --> 00:16:00.807\nthat's why we actually want\nto go through a few of them.\n\n283\n00:16:00.807 --> 00:16:03.344\nAnd we'll actually be\nlooking specifically at one\n\n284\n00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:05.930\nof them really in depth\na little bit later on.\n\n285\n00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:11.028\nBut at least in overview, those are kinda\nthe big ones that we tend to see.\n\n286\n00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:14.250\nOutside the Linux world,\nthe actual desktop operating system\n\n287\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.770\nconverts to the server\noperating system very easily.\n\n288\n00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:22.180\nCuz it's actually designed to be both and\nit's just the features that you choose to\n\n289\n00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.080\nturn on and the features you\nchoose not to turn on instead.\n\n290\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.700\nWhereas inside of Windows it's\nactually two separate products.\n\n291\n00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:35.830\nSo, you actually see those all over every\nenvironment that you end up working with\n\n292\n00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:40.920\nas you continue to move through your\ncareer at working with computers.\n\n293\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.500\nSo there are plenty of them out there for\nyou to be able to encounter, and\n\n294\n00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.350\neach one will have little\ntweaks that you'll have to do.\n\n295\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.650\nIn other words, you'll have to\nlearn a little bit differently, but\n\n296\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.500\nthey should feel relatively\nseamless as you move across them.\n\n297\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.180\nMaybe not as easy if you\nswitch from Mac to Windows or\n\n298\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.170\nWindows back to a Macintosh\noperating system.\n\n299\n00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.290\nBut you should be able to do so and\nfigure it out easily at some point.\n\n300\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.150\nIt'll take you a little bit of time and\n\n301\n00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.190\nthen you'll feel right at home in\nboth operating systems as well.\n\n302\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.080\nSo there's plenty out there for\n\n303\n00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.520\nus to understand when we\nstart taking a look of that.\n\n304\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:23.570\nAnd that's all about the human interface\nside on which operating system\n\n305\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.122\nwe will tend to choose as well.\n\n306\n00:17:26.122 --> 00:17:29.430\nOkay, so Dr. Omwansa,\nafter understanding some of\n\n307\n00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.910\nthe basics there on some of the different\ntypes of operating systems.\n\n308\n00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.790\nWe still need to deal with the idea\nof how the operating systems\n\n309\n00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.160\nreally deal with the hardware\na lot of times as well, right.\n\n310\n00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.020\n>> That's correct.\n\n311\n00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.300\nI mean the main manufacturers\nof hardware out there.\n\n312\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.740\nSo today if I wanted to buy a mouse,\n\n313\n00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.990\nI don't have to get it from\none particular supplier.\n\n314\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:54.016\nI mean the different kind of manufacturers\nwho make software or hardware.\n\n315\n00:17:54.016 --> 00:17:57.580\nYou can get printers,\nyou can get scanners.\n\n316\n00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.980\nAnd whenever you're buying a computer,\n\n317\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.130\nthose things don't\nnecessarily come with it.\n\n318\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.880\nSo you may have to buy some\nof those things later on.\n\n319\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:11.210\nAnd now you need them to enable them\nto communicate with your computer.\n\n320\n00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:16.230\nSo ask yourself really when you're buying\nthat particular new device, hardware or\n\n321\n00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:21.350\ncamera or whatever, and you're connecting\nit to the computer, how does that\n\n322\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:26.790\noperating system gets to know the language\nthat that device is going to understand.\n\n323\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.540\nAnd how, because this is your\ninterface to that hardware and\n\n324\n00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.610\nit needs to control that hardware.\n\n325\n00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.963\nSo what really happens is that,\nmanufacturers of devices create some\n\n326\n00:18:35.963 --> 00:18:39.134\nparticular software,\nthat can be understood, or\n\n327\n00:18:39.134 --> 00:18:44.468\nmore like an in between right there, that\ncan be understood by the operating system.\n\n328\n00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:48.368\nSo what the operating system is going\nto look for is that software that it\n\n329\n00:18:48.368 --> 00:18:52.788\ncan connect to, and then that software and\nthen now enables the operating system\n\n330\n00:18:52.788 --> 00:18:57.470\nto communicate with that particular\ndevice, and we call that driver.\n\n331\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.048\nSo basically, every hardware device\nis going to come with some drivers.\n\n332\n00:19:02.048 --> 00:19:06.610\nIt can be` one driver or\nyou may hear drivers for that matter.\n\n333\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.850\nAnd the operating system will\ninteract with those drivers in order\n\n334\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:11.920\nto interact with that device.\n\n335\n00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.637\nSo sometimes it happens that maybe\na driver can get outdated and\n\n336\n00:19:16.637 --> 00:19:19.226\nthere is a new version of a driver.\n\n337\n00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:22.290\nSo sometimes it becomes\nnecessary to upgrade or\n\n338\n00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.591\nupdate the drivers that\nyou have on your computer.\n\n339\n00:19:25.591 --> 00:19:30.228\nOr I remember when sometimes back\nwhen we could get a device and\n\n340\n00:19:30.228 --> 00:19:35.710\nwe want to install, and then all\nof a sudden we don't get a driver.\n\n341\n00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.980\nAnd so what do we have to do?\n\n342\n00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.880\nWe have to go all over the place\nlooking for that driver.\n\n343\n00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.790\nAnd so once we finally get the driver,\nyou run that driver,\n\n344\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.810\nan operating system that understands and\nthen it connects and looks for\n\n345\n00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.230\nthat particular hardware and then all\nof sudden the hardware starts to work.\n\n346\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:54.060\nSo drivers is a language that you\nare gonna somehow come across.\n\n347\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.450\nBut the beautiful thing about modern\noperating systems is that they\n\n348\n00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.920\nhave the concept of plug and play, which\ntherefore means, you don't have to now\n\n349\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.340\nwalk around looking for\nwhere is my driver now, put it over here.\n\n350\n00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.285\nCan you run it so\n\n351\n00:20:06.285 --> 00:20:10.370\nthat now, my computer can begin to\ninteract with that particular hardware?\n\n352\n00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.040\nNo, it doesn't have to be the case.\n\n353\n00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.445\nSo, the operating system now automatically\nlooks for the appropriate driver.\n\n354\n00:20:17.445 --> 00:20:22.630\nSearches it, figure out where\nit is in the system, runs it,\n\n355\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.020\nnow begins to interact with\nthat particular device.\n\n356\n00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.920\nSo automatically I can get now\na hardware device and plug it in here,\n\n357\n00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.680\nand then I can see a few things\nhappening on the screen, and\n\n358\n00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.760\nthen at some point it will just\nsay tell me, you're ready to walk.\n\n359\n00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.820\nYour device is now ready for use.\n\n360\n00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.157\nI want to believe that, Ron,\nyou've interacted with drivers.\n\n361\n00:20:40.157 --> 00:20:44.135\nSo did you create one driver to\nenable this walk through that?\n\n362\n00:20:44.135 --> 00:20:48.006\n>> [LAUGH] Well I have dealt with drivers\nover my period of time in working with\n\n363\n00:20:48.006 --> 00:20:48.712\ncomputers.\n\n364\n00:20:48.712 --> 00:20:53.300\nAnd drivers are, they are complicated\nlittle pieces of code.\n\n365\n00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.040\nNow you may be wondering why are they so\ncomplicated?\n\n366\n00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.970\nWell think about what Dr. Omwansa told us.\n\n367\n00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.210\nThat there are many hardware\nvendors that are out there and\n\n368\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.350\neach one they have hired,\nwell multiple programs.\n\n369\n00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.630\nNot every single programmer thinks\nexactly in the same way but\n\n370\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.130\nyou only have one operating system.\n\n371\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.530\nSo what in the world does\na driver help us to do?\n\n372\n00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.960\nEvery vendor then follows\na particular code that says,\n\n373\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.630\nthis is what you must, or the way you\nmust interact with this operating system.\n\n374\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:30.140\nSo now,\nregardless of who develops the driver for\n\n375\n00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.960\nwhatever that hardware is,\nthey simply follow that direction so\n\n376\n00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.120\nthat they can communicate successfully\nwith the operating system.\n\n377\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.070\nSo now, not every hardware vendor has\nto submit themselves saying no we have\n\n378\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.880\nto actually do it this way, they simply\ndevelop their driver the way that they\n\n379\n00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.780\nwant to as long as it actually\ninteracts with the operating system.\n\n380\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:54.233\nEven more than that today,\non the modern operating systems like Dr.\n\n381\n00:21:54.233 --> 00:21:56.260\nOmwansa was telling us about, you and\n\n382\n00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.660\nI do not tend to have to worry\nabout the driver installation.\n\n383\n00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.300\nAnd the reason why is\nbecause hardware vendors\n\n384\n00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:08.460\nautomatically send their drivers\nto a place like Microsoft Windows.\n\n385\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.020\nAnd then when they publish and\nthey produce an operating system.\n\n386\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.800\nIt's already built in to\nthe operating system.\n\n387\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.930\nSo that's what Dr. Omwansa was\ntalking about in terms of plug and\n\n388\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.980\nplay, that now you can buy\nthe hardware device that you want to,\n\n389\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.110\nplug it into the computer\nrunning that operating system.\n\n390\n00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.669\nAnd then the computer itself and the\noperating system will look through its own\n\n391\n00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:33.245\ndatabase of device drivers and\ntry and find a match.\n\n392\n00:22:33.245 --> 00:22:37.470\nNow these device drivers are not\nfull featured in that sense, but\n\n393\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.670\nthey are normally bare minimum\nenough to get that device to work.\n\n394\n00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.430\nAnd then once you actually\nhave that device working.\n\n395\n00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:50.760\nMost of the devices today automatically\nsay hey, we have noticed you have this\n\n396\n00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:56.050\ndriver that works, but would you like to\nsee if there is an update to the driver?\n\n397\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.275\nAnd on it,\nit gives you a button that you press,\n\n398\n00:22:58.275 --> 00:23:02.460\nwhich will connect you out to the Internet\nand download the latest driver.\n\n399\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:07.090\nAnd that may offer your device more\nfeature and functionality, that you can\n\n400\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.040\nthen access through the operating system,\nto get it to work better.\n\n401\n00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.300\nAnd so, it is a very neat concept for\nus that we don't have to look for it.\n\n402\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:22.820\nNow, if your device is old, and it can\npossibly be this way, where you actually\n\n403\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.530\ndo have a very old device, you plug it in\nand it just says, I don't know what to do.\n\n404\n00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.420\nI'm looking for a driver,\nbut I cannot find one.\n\n405\n00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.860\nAt that point, you may need to go out and\nuse your favorite search engine, and\n\n406\n00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.700\nsearch for a driver for that device.\n\n407\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.680\nSo, a lot of times unless it's very old,\nor unless it's very brand new.\n\n408\n00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.064\nIn other words you made the hardware,\n\n409\n00:23:43.064 --> 00:23:45.801\nmore than likely you do not have to\nworry about the majority of the drivers.\n\n410\n00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:49.256\nAnd that's always in the windows world.\n\n411\n00:23:49.256 --> 00:23:54.060\nAs you start moving into other operating\nsystems like Linux though You may find\n\n412\n00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:59.310\nout that there is not a driver developed\nfor that piece of hardware sometimes.\n\n413\n00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:00.360\nAnd what does that mean for you?\n\n414\n00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.310\nIt means you might not\nbe able to use that.\n\n415\n00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.050\nInside of a Windows world, you will.\n\n416\n00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:08.970\nMacintosh is also different\nin that their peripherals,\n\n417\n00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:13.360\nall of the other devices, they\nare normally designed by Macintosh itself,\n\n418\n00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.270\nor Apple, and so they all ready\nhave their own drivers built in.\n\n419\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.280\nYou do not have to worry about going\nout and looking for those devices.\n\n420\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.070\nBecause they designed the hardware that\ngoes along with that operating system and\n\n421\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.130\nthey only include their drivers into it.\n\n422\n00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.690\nSo we normally do not have to look for\n\n423\n00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.410\nexternal drivers inside\nof the Apple world.\n\n424\n00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.880\nWindows world, probably don't have to\nlook for the majority of them either.\n\n425\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.914\nIn the Linux, world you may have to.\n\n426\n00:24:36.914 --> 00:24:41.165\nAnd normally these are actually developed\nby other third party people that say, that\n\n427\n00:24:41.165 --> 00:24:45.410\nvendor didn't develop any, so let me write\none for it and it may work and it may not.\n\n428\n00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.190\nYou may have some choices there.\n\n429\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.210\nBut just kinda realize that at this point,\n\n430\n00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.050\ndrivers are a very important part\nif you want hardware to work.\n\n431\n00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.638\nIf you plug in a piece of hardware and\nit doesn't work,\n\n432\n00:24:54.638 --> 00:24:57.071\nyou may wanna check and\nsee if it's a driver issue.\n\n433\n00:24:57.071 --> 00:25:00.770\n>> Great, I really, really like\nthe way you've summarized it and\n\n434\n00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.380\nkind of expounded in a little more detail.\n\n435\n00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.410\nNow think about it this way.\n\n436\n00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:11.206\nHow are files organized in the computer?\n\n437\n00:25:11.206 --> 00:25:14.972\nIf someone tells you this is the memory,\nthis is the hard disk, and\n\n438\n00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:17.940\nthings are in there,\nyoun't can visualize that.\n\n439\n00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.200\nSo, what basically the operating system\nnow, which is one of its functions,\n\n440\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.980\nis to organize files and then make them\nin a manner that you can easily see.\n\n441\n00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.450\nSo, I'm gonna try and open My Computer and\n\n442\n00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.640\ndemonstrate a little bit\nwhat's going on over there.\n\n443\n00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:43.600\nSo, if I go to my Start button and then\nI click let say My Computer, all right?\n\n444\n00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.290\nSo, all of a sudden, I have an interface\nthat I'm going to interact with.\n\n445\n00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:54.180\nRight up here is an address bar,\nwhich enables me to type if I wanted to.\n\n446\n00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.190\nOr at least it can show\nme exactly where am I.\n\n447\n00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:00.200\nSo right now,\nI'm actually at the computer.\n\n448\n00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.940\nSo, what that means is that\nI am at the root folder, so\n\n449\n00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.690\nwe can speak, I'm at the root,\nat the beginning.\n\n450\n00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.340\nSo from there,\neverything else I can trace.\n\n451\n00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.930\nYou can see on the left here,\n\n452\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.992\nthere are a number of things\nthat I could easily click.\n\n453\n00:26:14.992 --> 00:26:19.811\nI could go to My Favorites,\nwhich inside there there's the Desktop.\n\n454\n00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:21.430\nI can see libraries here.\n\n455\n00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:26.560\nNow I click the Computer, I can see that\nthere is something called Local Disk C.\n\n456\n00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.880\nAnd maybe there could have\nbeen another one over here.\n\n457\n00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.920\nI'm actually seeing the Drive D, so\nthat [INAUDIBLE] starts to tell me\n\n458\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.310\nthat the operating system organizes\nthings into some form of a structure.\n\n459\n00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:44.208\nTypically, without us worrying too much\ninternally how things are organized\n\n460\n00:26:44.208 --> 00:26:50.360\nbecause there are partitions\nin the hard drive.\n\n461\n00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.884\nAnd then, the operating\nsystem is installed in there.\n\n462\n00:26:54.884 --> 00:26:59.507\nAnd then files are now starting to appear\nfrom a certain location in the hard disk,\n\n463\n00:26:59.507 --> 00:27:00.782\nand things like that.\n\n464\n00:27:00.782 --> 00:27:05.610\nBut what we are gonna be seeing\nis partitions in terms of drives.\n\n465\n00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.020\nSo, we could have more than one drive.\n\n466\n00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.633\nIt doesn't have to be only the C drive.\n\n467\n00:27:11.633 --> 00:27:15.180\nThat drive that I'm accessible to\n[INAUDIBLE] have files in there.\n\n468\n00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.460\nSome of them are pre-installed\nby the operating system and\n\n469\n00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.270\nsome of them,\nI'm the one who has put them there.\n\n470\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.230\nSo as you can tell,\nthere's several folders in there.\n\n471\n00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:30.660\nIf I click one of the folders, I get\nto see other numbered folders in there.\n\n472\n00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.500\nAnd what is happening in the address\nline is that as I go farther and\n\n473\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.960\nfarther in, it keep on introducing one\nadditional folder, one additional folder,\n\n474\n00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.320\nso now what I'll end up\nwith here is a path.\n\n475\n00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.370\nWe'll call it a path and say, okay, so\n\n476\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:48.990\nfor me to get to this particular folder\nthis is the path that I will take.\n\n477\n00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.580\nThat gives you some kind\nof hierarchical structure.\n\n478\n00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.940\nSo then at the top would be a root folder,\n\n479\n00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.690\nand then in there there\ncan be several folders.\n\n480\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.830\nAnd within those folders,\n\n481\n00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.930\nthere can be several other folders\nuntil you get to a particular file.\n\n482\n00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.970\nSo if I keep moving in, I keep moving in,\n\n483\n00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.820\nI finally get a .DLL folder, file rather.\n\n484\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.550\nI can get images,\nI can get different kinds of files.\n\n485\n00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.280\nSo that's a general structure.\n\n486\n00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.016\nAnd when you're working\nin a command line and\n\n487\n00:28:19.016 --> 00:28:24.276\nyou're not necessarily using a graphical\ninterface version of an operating system,\n\n488\n00:28:24.276 --> 00:28:26.830\nI probably will type that pass.\n\n489\n00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.130\nWhich then will lead me to\nthat particular file or\n\n490\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:35.420\na folder depending on what exactly my path\nwas and what did I want to achieve then.\n\n491\n00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.450\nNow, something else that you\nsee in this interface is\n\n492\n00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.640\nthat you can view these\nthings differently.\n\n493\n00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.760\nYou can view them as large icons.\n\n494\n00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.200\nAnd they become very, very large.\n\n495\n00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.060\nOr I can get to see them as details, which\nthen gives me an opportunity to see what\n\n496\n00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.960\ndate was this document created or updated.\n\n497\n00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.180\nWhat type is it, is it GIF?\n\n498\n00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.840\nWe'll talk about that a little bit,\nabout file types in a little while.\n\n499\n00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.642\nWhat size is it?\n\n500\n00:28:58.642 --> 00:28:59.837\nAnd then I can organize that.\n\n501\n00:28:59.837 --> 00:29:03.822\nIf I want to sort by date, so\nI can see which file is created first,\n\n502\n00:29:03.822 --> 00:29:05.350\nI easily get that.\n\n503\n00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:09.642\nOr the other way around,\nfrom the last to first, I can order by\n\n504\n00:29:09.642 --> 00:29:15.280\nalphabetical order,\n\n505\n00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.630\nalphabetically, what would be the first\nfile, or the other way around?\n\n506\n00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.500\nI can order by size, and\n\n507\n00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.150\nthat gives me a sense that different\nfiles are different sizes.\n\n508\n00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.820\nSo even when I go back to the folders,\nthe folders will be of different sizes.\n\n509\n00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.066\nAnd if I wanted to know the size,\nI can see it over here.\n\n510\n00:29:33.066 --> 00:29:37.680\nAnd maybe if I can't, sometimes I can\nright-click here and look at Properties.\n\n511\n00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.539\nWhen you look at the Properties it gives\nyou a little more information about that\n\n512\n00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:41.570\nparticular file.\n\n513\n00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.440\nIt can tell you,\nit was created on this date,\n\n514\n00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.130\nmodified on this date, the last time\nit was accessed was on this date.\n\n515\n00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.980\nThere's some few attributes about it.\n\n516\n00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.146\nIt can tell you about the size,\nit can tell you about the location, and\n\n517\n00:29:53.146 --> 00:29:55.570\nthat gives you the path and\nmany, many other things.\n\n518\n00:29:55.570 --> 00:30:00.010\nIn addition, there are other elements that\nyou can learn about a particular file.\n\n519\n00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.550\nSo if I click all these tabs it gives me\na little more information about that file.\n\n520\n00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.474\nIf I have rights on something,\n\n521\n00:30:06.474 --> 00:30:10.990\nlike I have authority to make a change\non something, I can make a change.\n\n522\n00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:16.218\nBut if I don't, then the system will say,\nno, you can't make that change.\n\n523\n00:30:16.218 --> 00:30:18.981\nThere are some files in\nhere that you can reach,\n\n524\n00:30:18.981 --> 00:30:23.430\nmove around if they're your files or\na file's created by someone else.\n\n525\n00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.150\nBut remember that there\nare also system files.\n\n526\n00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:30.500\nSo if you try to play around with the\nsystem files, especially as you can see,\n\n527\n00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.260\nprogram files in here, you can see\nsomething around Windows, for example.\n\n528\n00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.980\nThere's a on Windows.\n\n529\n00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.710\nYou wanna be careful when you try to make\nany change in any of these folders or\n\n530\n00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.350\nfiles, because you can harm a significant\nimplication on the operating system.\n\n531\n00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.698\nIn some cases,\nthe operating system can tell you, uh-huh,\n\n532\n00:30:47.698 --> 00:30:50.350\ndon't touch that one,\nyou're not allowed to do it.\n\n533\n00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:55.287\nBut sometimes you might be able to do it,\nand then from there the operating system\n\n534\n00:30:55.287 --> 00:30:59.365\ndoesn't function as you expected or\nas normally it does operate.\n\n535\n00:30:59.365 --> 00:31:02.531\nSo there are many things that\nwe can talk about files.\n\n536\n00:31:02.531 --> 00:31:05.245\nThere are many things you\ncan do with these files.\n\n537\n00:31:05.245 --> 00:31:08.670\nYou can compress files,\nyou can move them around.\n\n538\n00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:12.921\nJust like we learned in the basic\nsoft computing, you can copy a file,\n\n539\n00:31:12.921 --> 00:31:17.389\nyou can paste it somewhere, you can\ndelete a file, you can update a file,\n\n540\n00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:20.223\nyou can create new files,\nyou can move files.\n\n541\n00:31:20.223 --> 00:31:22.117\nAll manner of things.\n\n542\n00:31:22.117 --> 00:31:28.290\nAnd when we spoke about drives,\nthis is a drive that is internal here.\n\n543\n00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:33.150\nEvery time I connect an external\ndevice like flash disk, or\n\n544\n00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.020\nmemory disk, whatever you wanna call it.\n\n545\n00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.480\nWhen I install it over here and\nit automatically gets recognized,\n\n546\n00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.729\nit creates a new drive.\n\n547\n00:31:39.729 --> 00:31:43.564\nSo now we will end up with C and\npossibly the next one.\n\n548\n00:31:43.564 --> 00:31:46.420\nSo we can have many, many drives here.\n\n549\n00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.232\nWe can partition a drive and\nit becomes several drives.\n\n550\n00:31:49.232 --> 00:31:54.116\nAnd what will happen is, the sum total of\ntheir spaces will be equal to the space\n\n551\n00:31:54.116 --> 00:31:57.224\nthat was originally there\nin the original drive.\n\n552\n00:31:57.224 --> 00:32:02.118\nSo, there are very many features that we\ncan talk about in terms of the way files\n\n553\n00:32:02.118 --> 00:32:03.630\nare organized.\n\n554\n00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.165\nAnd we can go on and on and on.\n\n555\n00:32:05.165 --> 00:32:09.402\nBut, you need to put your hands around it,\nget a feel of it, scroll around, and\n\n556\n00:32:09.402 --> 00:32:13.456\nyou'll get to see how things are organized\nbased on some of the compositions\n\n557\n00:32:13.456 --> 00:32:14.252\nwe've had.\n\n558\n00:32:14.252 --> 00:32:17.330\nI believe Ronnie,\nyou have one more thing about files.\n\n559\n00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:21.420\n>> [LAUGH] When we start taking look then\nat the idea of the file system, right?\n\n560\n00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.680\nThere are several things hat we\ndo need to understand and Dr.\n\n561\n00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.140\nOmwansa has shown us and told us why\nhaving a file system is important because\n\n562\n00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.850\nit allows to do all those things in terms\nof organizing as well as allow us to use\n\n563\n00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.400\nsome of the features in\nthe operating system to build and\n\n564\n00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.530\nmanage those files more\neffectively as well.\n\n565\n00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.620\nNow, that file system though has to be\naccording to what the operating system\n\n566\n00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.640\ncan see.\n\n567\n00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.300\nSo normally on your hard drive,\nwhat happens is that your computer\n\n568\n00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.290\nautomatically when you first install\nan operating system onto a computer,\n\n569\n00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.230\nit provides the formatting that\nthe operating system says,\n\n570\n00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.980\nyes I can read that picker\ntype of file system.\n\n571\n00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.200\nAnd so once that's written in that way,\n\n572\n00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.080\nthen we can start doing the organization\nlike what Dr. Omwansa was saying.\n\n573\n00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.940\nWe can partition the drive, which makes\nus be able to take one physical drive and\n\n574\n00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.560\ntreat it like it's multiple\nhard drives if we want to.\n\n575\n00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.150\nThat way we're actually separating out\nthe space to allow us to actually say,\n\n576\n00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:23.040\nI just wanna make sure that I see them,\nthat I treat them as different drives.\n\n577\n00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.640\nWe can also do that idea of\ncompression and encryption and so\n\n578\n00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.510\nmany other things that are actually based\non the file system that we end up using.\n\n579\n00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:36.270\nSo normally you actually don't tend to\nhave to worry about the file system\n\n580\n00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:39.330\ntoo much, even on a regular flash drive\n\n581\n00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:43.650\nthat you may buy from\nan electronic store somewhere.\n\n582\n00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.340\nNormally it already comes\nwith a file system on it, and\n\n583\n00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.890\nthat's why when you insert it in,\nthe operating system recognizes it and\n\n584\n00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.990\nsays you can use it right away.\n\n585\n00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.190\nBut if you happen to have one or\n\n586\n00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:58.210\nsomebody gave you one, they said,\nI formatted this drive, and\n\n587\n00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:02.560\nit's not recognized on your computer, it\nmay tell you that there's a drive there.\n\n588\n00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.215\nThat file explorer that Dr.\n\n589\n00:34:04.215 --> 00:34:09.020\nOmwansa showed you may say there is\na hard drive here, but it's not online.\n\n590\n00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.960\nAnd so what you might have to do then\nis you might have to actually go in and\n\n591\n00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.130\nchange that, so\nit can be recognized by the computer.\n\n592\n00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.470\nAnd that's really kind of the key here\nin terms of those files and those file\n\n593\n00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:24.130\nsystems, is to understand at least\nthe basics of understanding that as well.\n\n594\n00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:27.980\nAnd then, ultimately in the end,\nyou also of course need to understand\n\n595\n00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.420\nthe idea here on operating systems that\nit also gives you one of those utility\n\n596\n00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.895\nthings that application that we have\nis that idea of backups as well.\n\n597\n00:34:36.895 --> 00:34:41.710\nBackups are very important in today's\nworld because if you store everything on\n\n598\n00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:45.510\na regular computer's hard drive,\nthat is fine,\n\n599\n00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.940\nyou can do that, but without a backup.\n\n600\n00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.430\nThis computer hard drive\ncould die at any moment and\n\n601\n00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:55.865\nso, where do my files go if I can\nno longer access that hard drive?\n\n602\n00:34:55.865 --> 00:34:59.070\nThey're gone, they are inaccessible.\n\n603\n00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:02.840\nBut, having a back up then,\nallow me to actually make sure that I\n\n604\n00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.580\nhave a copy of all my files that\nI need on a separate disk then,\n\n605\n00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:12.780\nI can replace the computer that's\nthe necessary mode that I have to do.\n\n606\n00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.890\nAnd then, I can restore those\nfiles back to that computer and\n\n607\n00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:17.420\nstill have those copies.\n\n608\n00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.610\nSo you do wanna make sure\nthat you understand that.\n\n609\n00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.360\nIt's not just enough to understand\nthat there's a file system there and\n\n610\n00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.670\nthen operating system is there, but some\nof these utilities and tools are really\n\n611\n00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:30.840\ndesigned to ensure that any data that\nyou tend to keep can remain there so\n\n612\n00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.086\nthat you don't have to actually go and\nrecreate them again or lose them forever.\n\n613\n00:35:34.086 --> 00:35:37.110\nSo Dr. Omwansa,\n\n614\n00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:41.790\nwe have a good understanding now then,\nof the basics of operating systems.\n\n615\n00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.940\nIs there any last words that we need to\nunderstand about just an overview of some\n\n616\n00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.795\nof the different types or anything else?\n\n617\n00:35:48.795 --> 00:35:52.115\n>> I think we've covered\nthe ground that we needed.\n\n618\n00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:57.995\nAnd since you've mentioned backups and\nthe possibility of compressing files so\n\n619\n00:35:57.995 --> 00:36:01.255\nthat they become a little smaller,\nand moving things,\n\n620\n00:36:01.255 --> 00:36:03.285\ncopying things in different places.\n\n621\n00:36:03.285 --> 00:36:06.115\nWe have a sense of how to\nplay around with files.\n\n622\n00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:11.710\nBe careful about files,\nespecially changing the file types because\n\n623\n00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.070\nyou can very easily change a file and\nthen it becomes corrupted.\n\n624\n00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:18.560\nWell, that simply means maybe you\nmight not be able to update again and\n\n625\n00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.560\naccess it again.\n\n626\n00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.520\nSo you want to be careful\nwhenever you manipulate files and\n\n627\n00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.980\nmake sure if you have files\nthat you must protect,\n\n628\n00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:32.580\nthat you don't want other\npeople to open or delete,\n\n629\n00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:37.960\nyou can put controls on\nfiles like a password or\n\n630\n00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:42.990\nyou can encrypt them, that means\nconvert them into an unreadable format.\n\n631\n00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.510\nThere's some little features here and\nthere that you can use\n\n632\n00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:51.140\nto make sure that you can protect your\nfiles and guard your files if you should.\n\n633\n00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.200\nOtherwise, that's it from me and\n\n634\n00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.390\nwe can now move on to another\nsession when we come back.\n\n635\n00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.590\n>> All right,\nthat sound like a great idea then.\n\n636\n00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:02.990\nSo, we're gonna end this session, taking\nlook at the basics of operating systems.\n\n637\n00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:05.070\nAnd we are should gonna\nmove in to another section,\n\n638\n00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.710\nwe're gonna spend some time inside\nof a specific operating system.\n\n639\n00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:12.427\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n640\n00:37:12.427 --> 00:37:13.450\n>> And my name is Dr.\n\n641\n00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:17.288\nTonny Omwansa, enjoying learning\ntogether operating

00:00:19.225\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and you're\nwatching the Computing Fundamentals IC3\n\n4\n00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:23.480\nshow, where we've been taking a look\nof course, not only at the system unit.\n\n5\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.860\nBut also at the basics of the operating\nsystem where we took some time to describe\n\n6\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.180\nwhat an operating system does for us.\n\n7\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.027\nBut in reality, most of us are gonna end\nup working in one operating system in\n\n8\n00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:35.711\nparticular and that is because,\n\n9\n00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:39.881\nwell it's the most popular operating\nsystem still an existence out there today.\n\n10\n00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:43.941\nAnd so we are gonna dive more\ninto what we call Windows 7.\n\n11\n00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:47.867\nSo we're gonna have a basic introduction\nto that, and here to make sure that we\n\n12\n00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:51.830\nunderstand all that we need to when\nwe get started is Dr. Tonny Omwansa.\n\n13\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.675\nDoctor Tonny, welcome back to our studios.\n\n14\n00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:54.525\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n15\n00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:58.535\nGlad to be here, now we're amassing\nourselves to one operating system, and\n\n16\n00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:00.255\ntrying to figure out how does it work.\n\n17\n00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:05.825\n>> So when we start taking a look then,\nabout this operating system in particular,\n\n18\n00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:10.805\nit has been around for a long time, and\nthe nice thing about it is it's relatively\n\n19\n00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:14.210\neasy for us to understand and\nbe able to use.\n\n20\n00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.260\nAnd so a lot of times we don't\nneed a lot of instructions.\n\n21\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.520\nThe screen itself is relatively\nself-explanatory, but\n\n22\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.290\nbecause we tend to see it in just\nabout every business environment and\n\n23\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.530\nyou might see that start to change.\n\n24\n00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.380\nAnd the reason why is because there\nare newer operating systems that\n\n25\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.510\nare out there, but\nyou'll probably still encounter this and\n\n26\n00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.520\njust about every office that is out there.\n\n27\n00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.490\nSo, we wanna have at least\na basic understanding and\n\n28\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.740\nso, we are going to start right here\nwith this one since it's so popular and\n\n29\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.380\nyou see it just about everywhere.\n\n30\n00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.797\nSo, Dr. Tonny, where do we need to begin?\n\n31\n00:01:45.797 --> 00:01:50.445\n>> All right, if we're gonna spend time\ntalking about an operating system in\n\n32\n00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:54.296\nparticular and the one that\nwe've chosen here is Windows 7.\n\n33\n00:01:54.296 --> 00:02:01.021\nSo Windows 7 is a version of Windows,\nthere have been many versions, 2007,\n\n34\n00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:06.785\nprobably the most recent,\nthere's 2010, many, many others.\n\n35\n00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:10.242\nSo we're gonna spend time\nlooking at Windows 7,\n\n36\n00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:14.935\nwhich then gives us an idea basically\nof how a typical graphical user\n\n37\n00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:18.800\ninterface based operating\nsystem functions.\n\n38\n00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.080\nWe'll try to understand that interface,\nwe'll think about how do you shut it?\n\n39\n00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.380\nHow do you start it?\n\n40\n00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.830\nAnd how do you play around\nas when you're looking for\n\n41\n00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.450\nspecific applications or\nmoving different files here and there?\n\n42\n00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.330\nHow do you do any form\nof management of files?\n\n43\n00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.640\nAnd hopefully by the time we finish this\n\n44\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.510\nepisode we will have understood\nreally how to move around Windows 7.\n\n45\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.230\n>> All right so, when we start talking\nabout this idea of moving around you might\n\n46\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.470\nbe wondering, why is that so important?\n\n47\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.030\nWhy do we really need to understand this?\n\n48\n00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.720\nWell, it's better that you actually have\na great understanding of how to navigate\n\n49\n00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.320\naround and the features that are available\nin Windows 7 before you start\n\n50\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.850\nworking in Windows 7 on a daily basis.\n\n51\n00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.650\nAnd the reason for\nthat is because you become more efficient\n\n52\n00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.690\nif you start off understanding at\nleast the basic foundation and\n\n53\n00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.030\ngroundwork of what you're looking at,\nat the very beginning.\n\n54\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.640\nAnd then understanding where\nyou're gonna locate files,\n\n55\n00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.750\nwhere you're gonna locate of course\napplications and what can you\n\n56\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.408\nactually do on the operating system\nitself, when you first get access to it.\n\n57\n00:03:21.408 --> 00:03:24.180\nSo Dr. Tonny, what are we gonna\ntake a look at first here?\n\n58\n00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.810\n>> Okay, the first thing we're gonna do\nis I've just positioned something on my\n\n59\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.705\nscreen to give you an idea of\nhow would this typical screen\n\n60\n00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:37.900\ninterface of Microsoft look like.\n\n61\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.760\nSo this image over here simply summarizes\nwhat you're seeing as your first screen\n\n62\n00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.680\nafter you log in.\n\n63\n00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.080\nThe computer has come on,\nyou probably had an opportunity to log in.\n\n64\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.380\nAnd now at the point of log in that simply\nmeans you must have entered the username\n\n65\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.600\nand the password, something like that.\n\n66\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.450\nAnd now you have the desktop, so\nthat's probably the best place to start.\n\n67\n00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.580\nAnd then of course, we'll move\nback a little bit and go forward.\n\n68\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.680\nNow, desktop gives you a snapshot of\nwhere does the start button, where is it?\n\n69\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.580\nIt's right to the left bottom corner,\n\n70\n00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.340\nthat's a very important button,\nwe almost always start from there.\n\n71\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.470\nRight at the base there\nare some pinned icons,\n\n72\n00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.020\nwhich means you can actually\npin an icon there so\n\n73\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.850\nthat it's very easy to access it, easy to\nclick it once the computer has come on.\n\n74\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.640\nThe whole line right there is\nthe task bar that every so\n\n75\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.910\noften we see the progress of different\nthings and things get listed down there.\n\n76\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.040\nAnd then towards the very\nend there's a notification\n\n77\n00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.720\narea which gives you an idea of\ndo you have Internet access,\n\n78\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.820\nhave you muted the sound,\nor what's the volume like?\n\n79\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.600\nWhat is the battery percentage left?\n\n80\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.340\nWhat is the amount of power you have left?\n\n81\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.960\nOr are you connected to electricity?\n\n82\n00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.550\nThen you have an opportunity\nto see the clock at the end,\n\n83\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.150\nyou get to see what the date is and\nthe time.\n\n84\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.900\nAnd then right on top of that is\nthe screen, just a blank screen.\n\n85\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.250\nBy default the Recycle Bin icon\nis always there and you can\n\n86\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.180\nthrow things to the recycle bin and can\npossibly bring them back if you needed to.\n\n87\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.870\nAnd in some cases you get a little\nmore than just the Recycle Bin.\n\n88\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.580\nNow as time goes by you can\nactually put things on the desktop.\n\n89\n00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.990\nThink about it, desktop, so\nit's a workstation of sorts, so\n\n90\n00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.130\nyou can easily put things in desktop.\n\n91\n00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.650\nSo right on my own personal desktop, so\nI have a few things that I put there so\n\n92\n00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.220\nthat you can see.\n\n93\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.790\n>> Just a few.\n\n94\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.765\n>> Or that I can see.\n\n95\n00:05:36.765 --> 00:05:40.340\n[LAUGH] Now the problem of course is\nthat if you put a lot of them, so\n\n96\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.260\nsometimes now even finding them\nbecomes a bit of a problem,\n\n97\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.650\ncuz I was working a lot the last few days.\n\n98\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.970\nAnd so I have moved things over\nthere is about time that I go and\n\n99\n00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.050\norganize my desktop again.\n\n100\n00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.670\nBut basically that desktop gives you\naccess to some document real quick.\n\n101\n00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.970\nIf I wanted to start looking for a\nparticular application I'll come and click\n\n102\n00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.950\nthe Start button and it gives me my first\nmenu there and I can see several things.\n\n103\n00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.090\nSo we'll get in to the details\nof each of these but\n\n104\n00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.650\nbasically that's your starting point.\n\n105\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.840\nRonnie do you have any thoughts\naround our starting point for\n\n106\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.230\nthe operating system Windows 7?\n\n107\n00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.870\n>> All right, so let's go and\ntake a look at my screen here and\n\n108\n00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.180\nthat will help us out.\n\n109\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.900\nSo, right here, this is the desktop\nthat Dr. Tonny was talking about.\n\n110\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.330\nNow, he has a lot more icons and I have it\nless because he probably uses this desktop\n\n111\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.700\ndifferently than the way that I do.\n\n112\n00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.190\nSo, you may find out where you do\nhave users that will constantly have\n\n113\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.110\na bunch of their files upon desktop.\n\n114\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.260\nIt's perfect place to do that It actually\nis designed for that to actually work.\n\n115\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.930\nMe, I tend to do things a little bit\ndifferently, where I go ahead and\n\n116\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.340\nI put everything inside, and\nI like my desktop nice and\n\n117\n00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.190\nclean, because I don't tend to\nreuse the same files all the time.\n\n118\n00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.925\nSo, it doesn't mean that Dr. Tonny's\nwrong, doesn't mean that I'm wrong,\n\n119\n00:06:56.925 --> 00:06:59.503\nit means that we use our computers\na little bit differently.\n\n120\n00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:03.175\nBut Dr. Tonny was also talking about\nsome of the default icons that show up.\n\n121\n00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:05.015\nSo here's this Recycle Bin so\n\n122\n00:07:05.015 --> 00:07:08.685\nthat if you happen to delete something\nit doesn't disappear into thin air, but\n\n123\n00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:13.560\nwhat ends up happening though is it\nsaves it right here in this location.\n\n124\n00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.810\nSo if I were to take, let's say for\nan example, this file and\n\n125\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.470\nI move it to the recycle bin.\n\n126\n00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.910\nYou can see where it actually ended\nup putting something in there and\n\n127\n00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.260\nthen you go, no, that was a mistake.\n\n128\n00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.480\nI didn't want to do that.\n\n129\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.720\nWell, now I can come here and you can see\nwhere it says I can restore this item\n\n130\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.760\nright away, it gives us that\nability to do that as well.\n\n131\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.070\nAnd then of course if you need to get\naccess into the rest of the system,\n\n132\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.910\nhere's what we're looking at in the lower\nleft hand corner as well, okay.\n\n133\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.930\nWhich is right here\nwhere it says Start and\n\n134\n00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.450\nthen here's some other icons\nthat I have available for me.\n\n135\n00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.863\nSo here let me zoom back out so\nwe can see it.\n\n136\n00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:55.747\nHere of course is a Start menu that\nwe go back to the other side and\n\n137\n00:07:55.747 --> 00:08:01.380\nthis gonna be behind my head so\nlet's see if we can show this screen here.\n\n138\n00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.200\nAnd you can see that it shows us\nthe local time and we can adjust that.\n\n139\n00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.641\nAnd then there are other settings that\nare also running in the background and\n\n140\n00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:11.830\nit shows you some,\nthe utilities that are running there.\n\n141\n00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.494\nNow, being familiar with just this\ninterface is really helpful because if\n\n142\n00:08:16.494 --> 00:08:19.836\nsomebody says,\nI need to see a file on your computer.\n\n143\n00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:22.167\nWell if you have no\nexperience with that and\n\n144\n00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:25.686\nthe file is not right there on\nyour desktop, well what do you do?\n\n145\n00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:27.622\nThis is a chance for you to explore and\n\n146\n00:08:27.622 --> 00:08:30.694\nunderstand that everything\nbegins at that start button.\n\n147\n00:08:30.694 --> 00:08:33.116\nAnd then you can click\non the Start button, and\n\n148\n00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:37.220\nthen from in here you can go and\ngo okay, where is that gonna be located?\n\n149\n00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.920\nI think it's gonna be on My Computer.\n\n150\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.860\nAnd that then that will open up the\ncomputer and you might at that point see,\n\n151\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.690\nwe go to the local hard drive and then\nyou actually start following around and\n\n152\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.170\nyou start finding your operating system\nand where files are gonna be located.\n\n153\n00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.140\nSo the desktop is the primary place,\nwhen you start the computer,\n\n154\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.830\nthis is normally what it launches into\nwith your files and your information.\n\n155\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.410\nAnd so\nthere's a lot of information for us.\n\n156\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.380\nBut this is where it begins,\nis understanding the nature.\n\n157\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.090\nAnd down here at bottom line Dr Tony\nwas saying, this is our Taskbar.\n\n158\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.520\nIf we have applications that are running,\n\n159\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.620\nwhat I should see a little icon\nrepresenting them down here\n\n160\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.850\nas well as actually in the Window that\nthey’re actually designed to be in.\n\n161\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.800\nAnd we can have them actually running\nlike this, or I can actually go ahead and\n\n162\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.690\nreduce them down and they simply hide\nright there on the Taskbar as well.\n\n163\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.331\nSo there's a lot of information\nright here that we can see.\n\n164\n00:09:32.331 --> 00:09:34.010\n>> Wonderful.\n\n165\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.880\nI really like that zooming bit,\n\n166\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.480\nbecause it gives an opportunity\nto focus into specific items.\n\n167\n00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.400\nSo what I've also done on my\nscreen now is that I want to come\n\n168\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.710\nto a little more specifics of that\nmenu that we just spoke about.\n\n169\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.240\nSo there is already\na structure on this menu.\n\n170\n00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.470\nSo right down here is a search box.\n\n171\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.960\nSo you can very easily type.\n\n172\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.850\nOnce you click the Start button,\nyou can very easily search for something.\n\n173\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.973\nSo if I search temp,\neverything seems to have disappeared and\n\n174\n00:10:03.973 --> 00:10:10.091\nfiles in the computer that have a name\ntemp on them, they're showing up.\n\n175\n00:10:10.091 --> 00:10:11.797\nAnd so it makes it easier, so\n\n176\n00:10:11.797 --> 00:10:16.620\nthat's why sometimes you see people\nare not using the mouse as much.\n\n177\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.950\nThey quickly type something and\nif I want to type Microsoft Word,\n\n178\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:25.080\nI can type Win Word there or\na short form of it and then it shows up.\n\n179\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.470\nSo that is one thing\nthat is a useful tool.\n\n180\n00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.095\nSo when you can't remember,\nwhere a particular file is found.\n\n181\n00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:34.525\nYou can use these to quickly search for\nsomething and\n\n182\n00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:36.015\nit will search the entire computer.\n\n183\n00:10:37.275 --> 00:10:42.250\nSo the rest up there is basically\nthe recently used applications.\n\n184\n00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:47.355\nSo the operating system has a capacity\nto always check your performance,\n\n185\n00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:51.801\nthe way you are using the computer and\nit tends to put the recently\n\n186\n00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:56.220\nused applications in that list so\nthat you can easily get them.\n\n187\n00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.110\nSo for me, I have used\nthe calculator recently, Notepad.\n\n188\n00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:07.018\nI've used Excel, I've used Skype, I've\nused Access, all the way to Google Chrome.\n\n189\n00:11:07.018 --> 00:11:10.384\nThere is a line here, that it might not\nbe very visible, but there's a line here.\n\n190\n00:11:10.384 --> 00:11:16.774\nAnd what is remaining up here\nis a list of applications\n\n191\n00:11:16.774 --> 00:11:21.744\nthat I have actually pinned right there.\n\n192\n00:11:21.744 --> 00:11:24.910\nAnd as much as down here,\nthe list may change.\n\n193\n00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.540\nOver here, the list does not change.\n\n194\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.600\nSo if I wanted to put, for example,\nthis application called Skype so\n\n195\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.750\nthat it doesn't become part of the pinned\nshortcuts, I can actually drag it up here.\n\n196\n00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.540\nHold down and drag, and\nthen it's now moved there.\n\n197\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.460\nSo it will not now not\nchange from that position.\n\n198\n00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.380\nIt will always be there, because I\nprobably want to use it on a very,\n\n199\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.880\nvery regular basis.\n\n200\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.350\nBut that's the second feature that\nis of interest as we begin to use\n\n201\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.352\nthe application.\n\n202\n00:11:51.352 --> 00:11:55.920\nThe third is that to what's to right here,\nthere is another button and\n\n203\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.390\nan arrow at the end.\n\n204\n00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.220\nIf you point to the arrow it\ngives you several options.\n\n205\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:06.710\nYou can see switch user, log off,\nlock, restart, sleep, hibernate.\n\n206\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.090\nWe'll come to this in\na short while to explain.\n\n207\n00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.340\nBut basically you now have a lot of\ncontrol about how the computer is\n\n208\n00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.740\ngoing to behave.\n\n209\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:20.030\nYou can tell it off right\nthere by just clicking Sleep.\n\n210\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.930\nAnd it will go into some\nkind of sleep mode, yeah?\n\n211\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.260\nYou can press this shut down and\nit will just go off.\n\n212\n00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.330\nSo we'll get into the details\nof the various options.\n\n213\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.580\nWhat does restart really mean?\n\n214\n00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.380\nWhat does lock mean?\n\n215\n00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.760\nWhat does change user mean?\n\n216\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.090\nBut there you do have a big\ncontrol on the computer.\n\n217\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.880\nThen going right up here we've got\na certain set of links, of features and\n\n218\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.470\nsettings.\n\n219\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.340\nSo if I want to understand\ngenerally about the computer,\n\n220\n00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.570\nI want to look at the drives and down,\nthe various forwarders that exist.\n\n221\n00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.280\nI will go to the Computer button.\n\n222\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.110\nIf I go to the Control button,\nit gives me an opportunity to look\n\n223\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:01.090\nat more like the dashboard, the view of\n\n224\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.918\nthe various controls that I have in\norder to manipulate the applications,\n\n225\n00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:10.760\nadd applications, remove applications,\nchange a few settings of the computer.\n\n226\n00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.520\nFurther on down I've got default program.\n\n227\n00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.480\nI've got help and support in the event.\n\n228\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.170\nI don't understand something,\nI can click that one as well.\n\n229\n00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:25.370\nRight up here, there's some current choose\nsome libraries like My Documents or\n\n230\n00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:31.200\nsomething about the hardware itself,\nthe manufacturer and things like that.\n\n231\n00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.180\nSo that general distribution gives you\nan opportunity to know if I want to\n\n232\n00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.750\nstart somewhere, I wanna go straight and\ndo something, where do I start from?\n\n233\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.590\nSo I hope that general menu has\ngiven you a snapshot basically\n\n234\n00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.300\nof what's available where.\n\n235\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.310\n>> Right, so when you start seeing\nthis particular start menu,\n\n236\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.520\nit is personalized for\nyou when you login to the computer.\n\n237\n00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.700\nLet me show you what I'm talking\nabout right here on my screen.\n\n238\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.210\nSo normally when you first\nlogin to the computer and\n\n239\n00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.850\nyou enter in normally a username and\npassword and\n\n240\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.800\nthen that brings up your desktop\njust like what we're seeing.\n\n241\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.170\nAnd then when we launch on the Start menu,\nyou can see for\n\n242\n00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.180\nexample right here it\nactually shows my name.\n\n243\n00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.440\nWhen I hover over it, it says,\nOpen your personal folders.\n\n244\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.075\nAnd that is now actually allowing me to\n\n245\n00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:24.065\nsay that if multiple users\nuse this very same computer,\n\n246\n00:14:24.065 --> 00:14:28.015\nmy information will be stored differently\nfrom other people's information.\n\n247\n00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:31.672\nI can go into documents and\nthat's my documents folder, not Dr.\n\n248\n00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:36.860\nTony's documents folder instead and so\nthat way his work is separated from mine.\n\n249\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.010\nSo it is a very personalized type of menu\n\n250\n00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.714\nthat also gets changed in replication\nof changes over here too.\n\n251\n00:14:43.714 --> 00:14:48.560\nIf Dr. Tony has pinned items and I don't,\nthat means even if he actually logs in to\n\n252\n00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:54.460\nthis computer, his pinned items will show\nup up at the top whereas I don't have any.\n\n253\n00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.664\nAnd so I don't have to worry,\nI don't have to wonder like was Dr.\n\n254\n00:14:57.664 --> 00:15:01.880\nTony working on my computer today,\ndid he mess anything up that I was doing?\n\n255\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.280\nI do not have to worry about that\nbecause the actual user interface for\n\n256\n00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.712\nWindows 7 is personalized\nper user as well.\n\n257\n00:15:09.712 --> 00:15:14.548\nDr. Tony also showed us down here at the\nbottom where we have the Shut down button\n\n258\n00:15:14.548 --> 00:15:15.133\nas well.\n\n259\n00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:17.850\nLet me zoom in, so\nthat we can see that a little bit better.\n\n260\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.929\nAnd notice that you have\nthis nice button so\n\n261\n00:15:19.929 --> 00:15:22.021\nthat you cannot mistake what it's about.\n\n262\n00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:26.850\nYou shut down computer, you're\npowering on off the computer itself.\n\n263\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.960\nBut notice this button over\nhere directly to the right,\n\n264\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.560\nyou have these other\noptions that are available.\n\n265\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.620\nLog off just simply means\nit's going to log you out and\n\n266\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.860\nallow another user to log back in.\n\n267\n00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.910\nIf you use switch user, it actually\nallows you to have your information\n\n268\n00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.230\nkind of just parked on the side but\nstill active.\n\n269\n00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.310\nAllows Doctor Tony to\nlog in at the same time.\n\n270\n00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.580\nHe can get the information that he\nwants and then he can log off and\n\n271\n00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.970\nyour work has not been disturbed.\n\n272\n00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.872\nThe other thing that you also\nhave here of course is Restart.\n\n273\n00:15:57.872 --> 00:16:00.891\nRestart allows you to,\nagain, shut everything down,\n\n274\n00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:04.885\nrestart the computer without you having\nthe push the Power button again.\n\n275\n00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:09.022\nAnd then you'll also have something\ncalled sleep which is a low power state.\n\n276\n00:16:09.022 --> 00:16:13.841\nAnd this is normally good for things\nlike your battery type of computers like\n\n277\n00:16:13.841 --> 00:16:19.378\nlaptops and netbook types of computers\nwhere you need to conserve battery life.\n\n278\n00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:23.770\nThe idea of sleep allows\nus to power off most of our\n\n279\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:30.650\nlaptops power consumption and\nthen when we need to use it automatically\n\n280\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.410\nall we have to do is normally move\nthe mouse around or click on a button.\n\n281\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.750\nAnd now the computer comes back\nto full power and full life, but\n\n282\n00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.960\nduring the sleep stage it's really\nat a low power state as well.\n\n283\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.220\nSo these options that available are things\nthat you should definitely take the time\n\n284\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:50.200\nto explore and\ntake a look at because it is essential for\n\n285\n00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.000\nyou if you're gonna be working with\ncomputers to at least do this.\n\n286\n00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.110\nAnd the nice thing Dr. Tonie,\nis that once they learn this, all right?\n\n287\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.840\nIs it really does transfer\nif you stay in Windows.\n\n288\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.540\nIf you go to Windows 10,\n\n289\n00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.980\nif you go to Windows 8.1 Windows 8.1\nis a little bit unusual by comparison.\n\n290\n00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:12.150\nBut Windows 10, it does have a menu\nstored like this, so the skills transfer.\n\n291\n00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.640\nSo whether you're actually doing that,\nyou should go.\n\n292\n00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.600\nIt's a little bit different,\nbut it still feels familiar.\n\n293\n00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.710\nAnd so learning these skills\nhere is really foundation for\n\n294\n00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.920\nwhat we wanna be able to do.\n\n295\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.590\n>> So, there you go.\n\n296\n00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:31.510\nYou can shut a computer, you can\nhibernate it, you can have some controls.\n\n297\n00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.230\nIt's your computer,\n\n298\n00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.900\nyou can personalize it, you can\nchange that background if you wanted.\n\n299\n00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.370\nWe'll get into a little more\ndetails of how you would that.\n\n300\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.450\nSo you have an opportunity to\nconfigure the computer to look in\n\n301\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.740\na way that you want.\n\n302\n00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.100\nAnd you know that personalization is\na powerful thing because it makes you\n\n303\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.470\nfeel like now, this is my thing.\n\n304\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.160\nThe way my mind works.\n\n305\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.900\nThat people who don't mind organizing\nthings all over the place, and\n\n306\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.030\nthey function very well.\n\n307\n00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.928\nOther people, very very systematic.\n\n308\n00:17:59.928 --> 00:18:02.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Very, very systematic and\n\n309\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.240\nthose people who are not\nsystematic are gonna go,\n\n310\n00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.810\nwell this gentleman is spending a lot\nof time moving things around here.\n\n311\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.880\nIs it gonna work or you know?\n\n312\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.480\nAnd then the other one also thinks there\nare different ways that people work and\n\n313\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.750\nthat's why personalization is important.\n\n314\n00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.670\nSo that you work the best way that\nyou find yourself comfortable.\n\n315\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.820\nSo let's talk a little bit about\nmanaging or manipulating Windows.\n\n316\n00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.020\nSo you see, why was it called\nWindows in the first place?\n\n317\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.360\nIt's an interesting question.\n\n318\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.330\nI wasn't there when they\nwere picking that name, but\n\n319\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.980\nat least I get a sense\nthat creating Windows,\n\n320\n00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:41.780\norganizing applications such that\nthey are visible in a window format.\n\n321\n00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.300\nYou know makes it easy for\nus to conceptualize things.\n\n322\n00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.520\nSo just to simply, let's try it,\n\n323\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.970\nI'm just gonna open a very simple\napplication which is called notepad.\n\n324\n00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:58.910\nSo I go right here,\nI click notepad and I have a window.\n\n325\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.320\nSo I have a window and now this window,\nI can do many things to it.\n\n326\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.760\nI can resize vertically, horizontally.\n\n327\n00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.750\nI can click right up at the address\nbar and I can move it around.\n\n328\n00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.620\nI can go to the menu and\nsay I want to save it.\n\n329\n00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.530\nI have several options there.\n\n330\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.640\nI can minimize it, and\nwe spoke about minimizing.\n\n331\n00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.960\nI can click it again and then I come and\nget it up here, I can resize it,\n\n332\n00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.430\nmaximize it, resize it takes me\nback to the way it was exactly.\n\n333\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.790\nThen from this menu I\ncan do many things here.\n\n334\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.300\nI can copy something in there, paste it,\n\n335\n00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.220\nI can use shortcuts if I have option for\nshortcuts.\n\n336\n00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.530\nI can format things in there.\n\n337\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.230\nSo this is a typical window.\n\n338\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.920\nNow you can have many windows, for example\nI can actually open another new part and\n\n339\n00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.360\nthen I have the second window and\nI can work simultaneously.\n\n340\n00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.390\nBut at one point in time I'm\nfocused on one particular file.\n\n341\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.590\nSo I can actually type things here.\n\n342\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.740\nAnd then I can copy, I can paste.\n\n343\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.820\nThere I am, I'm typing things.\n\n344\n00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.330\nNow I come to this other window, and\nI can type and I can paste things,\n\n345\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.680\nI can move around.\n\n346\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.170\nAnd each of these two files\nare different and distinct.\n\n347\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.690\nNow there are more complicated\napplications that can enable you to even\n\n348\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.640\nmerge and work with two different\ndocuments at the same time.\n\n349\n00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.820\nI can be working in Microsoft Word and\n\n350\n00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.820\nin the background is an Excel sheet\nthat is also being populated.\n\n351\n00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.970\nI can get to work with two different\npeople on the same document, depending on\n\n352\n00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:36.800\nhow we share that document, and be able\nto access it from different places.\n\n353\n00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.510\nThat is the power of the window.\n\n354\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.244\n>> When we start taking a look at the idea\nof Windows, you maybe wonder like Dr.\n\n355\n00:20:43.244 --> 00:20:47.380\nTanie did is why do they call them Windows\nand why is this an important feature?\n\n356\n00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.740\nBefore the interface that you see which\nwe call that graphical user interface.\n\n357\n00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:57.790\nAlso you see the term GUI in all\ncapital letters as an acronym.\n\n358\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.270\nWell before those days we only had the\ncommand line interface which meant that we\n\n359\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:05.640\ncould only launch one\nprogram at any one time.\n\n360\n00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.288\nSo if you wanted to use that notepad, Dr.\n\n361\n00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:12.130\nTanie could go ahead and do that and\nhe could launch that now and watch.\n\n362\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.160\nBut then for him to launch another\ninstance of it, he'd have to exit out and\n\n363\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.680\ngo back to the command line and launch it\nagain so he could actually use it again.\n\n364\n00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.290\nNow he could just save and close the\ndocument and do that but what we're seeing\n\n365\n00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:27.790\nis different applications now can be\nopened simultaneously and the only way for\n\n366\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:33.870\nthem to be able to have done that is to\nisolate those programs into individual,\n\n367\n00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.180\nwhat would look like windows\non a screen so they look like\n\n368\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.600\nyou were looking through the view of\none window versus another window.\n\n369\n00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.210\nAnd as you start to\nthink about the idea of\n\n370\n00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.550\nmultiple windows being in the same house.\n\n371\n00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.290\nYou look out one window,\nyou look out another window,\n\n372\n00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.000\nyou get two different views.\n\n373\n00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.460\nWell that's the idea behind Windows.\n\n374\n00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.930\nIt gives you that, but\nit allows you to do it simultaneously.\n\n375\n00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.410\nNow, the focus is very important.\n\n376\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.900\nIt doesn't mean that windows are active,\nand that's actually key.\n\n377\n00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.851\nYou did see when Dr.\n\n378\n00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:04.740\nTonie was working in one, the other\none looked a little bit grayed out.\n\n379\n00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:10.780\nAnd even if you open ten windows,\nyour focus is always on one of them.\n\n380\n00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.140\nAnd your key of course is to\nbe able to figure that out.\n\n381\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.370\nWhich one that is actually in\nfocus at that particular time.\n\n382\n00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.980\nAnd so a lot of times,\nall the rest of them,\n\n383\n00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.200\nif they're open up in\nthe background will be grade out.\n\n384\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.500\nThe one that actually is looks like\nis bold or is actually in focus,\n\n385\n00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.710\nthat is the one that you end up be\nworking in at that any one time.\n\n386\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.900\nSo, when we start taking look\nthen at the idea here of\n\n387\n00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.130\njust getting around Window itself.\n\n388\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.990\nOpening up multiple windows or\n\n389\n00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.470\nan application is actually\nan important part of what you see.\n\n390\n00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.770\nAnd if you were watching his task bar\ndown at the bottom, you noticed that when\n\n391\n00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.630\nhe ended up showing two windows, it\nactually only showed one of those buttons.\n\n392\n00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:51.590\nThat's because they went ahead and\n\n393\n00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.460\nstacked them right on top of the other one\nwhere they used to actually show up as\n\n394\n00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.590\nindividual windows down even\non the task bar itself.\n\n395\n00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.570\nSo, it is something that we will\n\n396\n00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.790\ngraphically need to\nunderstand to be able to see.\n\n397\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.690\nAnd it's something we need to\nknow how to functionally do\n\n398\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.790\ninstead of having to close out of one\nprogram and then work with another.\n\n399\n00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.510\nIt allows me to park one program in the\nbackground, work on something else, and\n\n400\n00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.390\nthen when I'm ready to work on the other\none I just simply click on it and\n\n401\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.660\nthat brings it into focus for me and then\nI can actually click on that title bar up\n\n402\n00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.550\nat the top and move that window to\ncontrol it wherever I want it to move so\n\n403\n00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.448\nthat we can actually use all\nthe full functionality of Windows 7.\n\n404\n00:23:30.448 --> 00:23:34.780\nSo Dr. Tonie, that's a lot of\ninformation right there that we do have.\n\n405\n00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.880\nWhat else do we need to take a look at?\n\n406\n00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.670\n>> I think in this particular session,\nI think it is important for\n\n407\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.520\nus to understand how to\nmove around with files.\n\n408\n00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.520\nSo, there's something called exploring.\n\n409\n00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.940\nYeah, as the word suggest you can explore,\nall right.\n\n410\n00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:57.596\nAnd so Windows have used that term and\nnow it sounds like a noun.\n\n411\n00:23:57.596 --> 00:24:00.456\nSo you can explore,\nyou can move things around.\n\n412\n00:24:00.456 --> 00:24:04.593\nSo we're gonna go to the Explorer\nwhich then enables us to move around.\n\n413\n00:24:04.593 --> 00:24:08.860\nWe talk about Windows Explorer, or\nyou can talk about Internet Explorer.\n\n414\n00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.360\nLet's talk about the Windows Explorer now.\n\n415\n00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.670\nFor me the easiest way I get here, and\nin the many ways of getting here, so\n\n416\n00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:21.050\nyou can go to the Start button and\nthen click Computer and then it gives you\n\n417\n00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.720\nthis interface that has now become\nvery common or I can just close it.\n\n418\n00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.170\nI like pressing Window E and\nit gets me to the same spot.\n\n419\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.680\nSo there are shortcuts and\nthat's part of understanding Windows\n\n420\n00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.770\nis that there are many many shortcuts\nthat you can use to do different things.\n\n421\n00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:40.080\nNow while I'm here, if I want to\nunderstand a little bit about my computer\n\n422\n00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.948\nI can right click the folder here or\nmy computer over here.\n\n423\n00:24:44.948 --> 00:24:48.280\nI can right-click and\nthen look at the properties.\n\n424\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.890\nWhen I look at the properties it gives\nme a little bit of information about\n\n425\n00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.130\nthe computer.\n\n426\n00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:57.080\nTells me the manufacturer is HP,\nthe processor is Intel,\n\n427\n00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.120\nthe capacity of the RAM,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n428\n00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.280\nThen there are things you can learn\nabout the operating system and\n\n429\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.469\nthe general layout of the computer.\n\n430\n00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:13.070\nNow, if right now I can click the C drive,\n\n431\n00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.810\nthere can be many drives as we spoke,\nso I have several files there.\n\n432\n00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:20.280\nSo what I'm going to try and do is that\nI'll create some folder here, I would\n\n433\n00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.110\ntry and move a document in there, I can\ndelete a document and things like that so\n\n434\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:29.422\nthat, we get for familiar to how around,\nhow we can move around our documents.\n\n435\n00:25:29.422 --> 00:25:32.890\nSo, what I'm going to try and\ndo is create a folder.\n\n436\n00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:37.150\nSo, I'm right now in the C drive,\nthe root folder of the C drive.\n\n437\n00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:41.230\nWhich means, in here,\nI have a lot of power now.\n\n438\n00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.260\nI can create documents in there.\n\n439\n00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.139\nI can create new folders,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n440\n00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.430\nI can start by creating a new folder.\n\n441\n00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.220\nThat's one way to do it or\nI can just right click here and\n\n442\n00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.780\nI have several options.\n\n443\n00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.480\nI can view, I can sort,\nI can group, I can refresh.\n\n444\n00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.490\nRefresh for example,\nthere is fairly easy to understand.\n\n445\n00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.850\nSort by is something,\nI'm going to arrange them by as in order.\n\n446\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.380\nI can group by something or I can refresh.\n\n447\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.690\nRefresh means maybe I'm having,\nsomebody may have put in things there and\n\n448\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.610\nI'm not very sure what they put there.\n\n449\n00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:17.984\nBy refreshing it just simply displays\neverything with certainty, so\n\n450\n00:26:17.984 --> 00:26:21.107\nI know what exactly is in\nthat particular folder.\n\n451\n00:26:21.107 --> 00:26:27.134\nSo there is paste here, paste a shortcut,\nundo delete that means,\n\n452\n00:26:27.134 --> 00:26:31.046\nif something had been\ndeleted I can undo it,\n\n453\n00:26:31.046 --> 00:26:36.620\nI can share and then I can do New and\nthat's one I wanted.\n\n454\n00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.710\nSo if I go to New I can\ncreate a new folder.\n\n455\n00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:43.680\nSo I only have a option for creating a\nfolder here, so I create a new folder, so\n\n456\n00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.150\nthere I am, I'm creating a new folder.\n\n457\n00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.440\nNow, by default, it's called New Folder.\n\n458\n00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.150\nNow, I can choose to leave it that way or\nI can change the name.\n\n459\n00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.810\nTypically, it's a good habit\nto change the name, so\n\n460\n00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.120\nyou give it a name that\nyou can relate with.\n\n461\n00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.240\nI could have moved this and\n\n462\n00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.120\nput it on desktop, which I'm just\nabout to do, but let's give it a name.\n\n463\n00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.075\nSo I'm gonna call it Temporary Folder.\n\n464\n00:27:05.075 --> 00:27:11.508\n[SOUND] Let's call Temp Folder.\n\n465\n00:27:11.508 --> 00:27:12.295\nEnter.\n\n466\n00:27:12.295 --> 00:27:14.875\nWhen I enter,\nmy new folder have been created.\n\n467\n00:27:14.875 --> 00:27:16.945\nAnd I can do many other things with it.\n\n468\n00:27:16.945 --> 00:27:18.945\nI can click it, enter.\n\n469\n00:27:18.945 --> 00:27:23.295\nIt opens the folder and\ncurrently there's nothing in that folder.\n\n470\n00:27:23.295 --> 00:27:24.955\nIt's understandably so.\n\n471\n00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:29.125\nSo let's see,\nI want to create another folder in there.\n\n472\n00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:33.180\nSo I can right click and\ngo ahead and do a new folder.\n\n473\n00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.590\nBut, now the advantage,\nbecause I'm not in the root folder,\n\n474\n00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.060\nI can create many other things.\n\n475\n00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:44.170\nI can create a folder, a shortcut,\nI can create a database.\n\n476\n00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:47.830\nAll of these things have been given\nto me as an option that I can use.\n\n477\n00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.820\nTo create, so if I wanted to create,\nsay I want a document.\n\n478\n00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.507\nI can click it automatically\na new file has been created\n\n479\n00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:59.685\nof the tight Microsoft Word and\nI can say first word document.\n\n480\n00:28:03.873 --> 00:28:05.493\nThat's I've given it a name and\n\n481\n00:28:05.493 --> 00:28:09.130\nautomatically I can see some little\ninformation about that file.\n\n482\n00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.090\nThe metadata which tells me okay,\nit was created on this date,\n\n483\n00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:17.220\nit's of this type, and\nthe file size is zero.\n\n484\n00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.041\nIf I right-click this file and\nlook at the properties, I can see, wow,\n\n485\n00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:23.520\nit's one document.\n\n486\n00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.660\nIt's stored in this particular path,\n\n487\n00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:31.770\nthis is the size, this is the date it was\ncreated and this is the characteristics\n\n488\n00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:36.700\nin terms of whether it's read only or\nhidden or whatever it may be.\n\n489\n00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:43.810\nI was walking on a text file here and\nI've never saved it.\n\n490\n00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:48.550\nSo this is an opportunity that I can use,\nassuming I've already created the file and\n\n491\n00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:49.830\nI need to save it somewhere.\n\n492\n00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.100\nWhat would I need to do?\n\n493\n00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.910\nSo I can go to file, save as.\n\n494\n00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:58.000\nI have an option of saving assuming\nit had been named before and\n\n495\n00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.540\nI'm just making a change on it then it\nwill just overwrite the existing file.\n\n496\n00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.430\nNow, I'm creating a new one,\nso I'll say Save As.\n\n497\n00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.910\nThen, I'll ask myself where\ndo I want to save it.\n\n498\n00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:12.910\nNow, let's say I want to create it\nexactly the folder that I just created.\n\n499\n00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:17.045\nSo, what I would do is,\nI need to remember, where was that folder?\n\n500\n00:29:17.045 --> 00:29:22.865\nIt was in the C drive, and then there\nwas a folder called Temp Folder.\n\n501\n00:29:22.865 --> 00:29:26.535\nI went to that Temp Folder and\nnow so what do I call,\n\n502\n00:29:26.535 --> 00:29:30.015\nI already know the pass, but\nwhat do I want to call the file.\n\n503\n00:29:30.015 --> 00:29:32.100\nSo I'll say well, Temp.\n\n504\n00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.260\nThat's a temp doc.\n\n505\n00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.060\nDoesn't have to mean much, but there I am.\n\n506\n00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.780\nIf I want to manipulate the file type,\n\n507\n00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.090\nsome applications allow me to\nchange the file type at this point.\n\n508\n00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.850\nMaybe I can make it as an Image,\nor I can make it as a PDF.\n\n509\n00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.900\nYou will learn more and\nmore of different types of files.\n\n510\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:55.970\nNow this is a text file, so I'm going to\nsave it as a text file and there it go.\n\n511\n00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:04.140\nWhat happened in my Explorer label\nis I'm not able to see the temp doc.\n\n512\n00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.220\nSo if I go over here and close out file.\n\n513\n00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.450\nAnd come back here and double-click it,\nit takes me to that file.\n\n514\n00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:15.990\nI can continue to make some change on it,\nwell that's just random stuff, and\n\n515\n00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.400\nthen I close.\n\n516\n00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.040\nIt asks me if I want to save the file,\nI go ahead and save it.\n\n517\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.755\nAnd if I go back to that folder and\n\n518\n00:30:22.755 --> 00:30:25.420\ndouble-click it,\nI'll get the changes over there.\n\n519\n00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:30.290\nNow, what will happen over time Is\nthat the file size will start growing.\n\n520\n00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.410\nNow it has become one kilobyte.\n\n521\n00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.140\nThe other one is still empty,\nso it's zero kilobytes.\n\n522\n00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.310\nThat means really has nothing.\n\n523\n00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:41.400\nNow I start, time goes by,\nthe documents keep growing.\n\n524\n00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.990\nAnd as time goes by as you keep working on\nyour computer, you keep creating files.\n\n525\n00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:50.490\nYou keep growing, all of a sudden\nyou have a lot of files and\n\n526\n00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.390\nmaybe even the space becomes less.\n\n527\n00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.680\nAnd you start looking for more space.\n\n528\n00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.880\nSo let me do one more thing here.\n\n529\n00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.520\nSuppose I want to move this file\nfrom here to another location.\n\n530\n00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.250\nLet us say I want to take\nit on to the desktop.\n\n531\n00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:09.240\nI'm going to resize my desktop,\nminimize everything and,\n\n532\n00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.000\nthen I say well,\nI want to put it onto the desktop.\n\n533\n00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.760\nThen I go to where exactly my\nfolder was and then I click it.\n\n534\n00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.030\nI have several ways to do it.\n\n535\n00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.980\nI could right click, copy it.\n\n536\n00:31:23.085 --> 00:31:26.790\nCut it, copied and\npasted onto the desktop.\n\n537\n00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.420\nOr I can drag it, so\nthat all those options are there.\n\n538\n00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.160\nSo let me say I want to copy, and\nI could have copied through this menu, or\n\n539\n00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.640\nI can simply do Ctrl+C.\n\n540\n00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.180\nSo I've copied it, just for\nus to see, I've pasted it.\n\n541\n00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.810\nNow it's right here.\n\n542\n00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.980\nAnd I can move it, I can drag it.\n\n543\n00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.690\nI can reorganize it depending on\nhow the settings of the desktop is.\n\n544\n00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:52.690\nNow because right now I don't\nintend to use it, I can delete it.\n\n545\n00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.400\nWhile I delete it I can delete\nby clicking the Delete button or\n\n546\n00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.180\nI can right click and say Cut.\n\n547\n00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.880\nThe problem with that,\nit means I must paste it somewhere.\n\n548\n00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.130\nBut that's what my intention.\n\n549\n00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.540\nI can decide,\nlet me click that delete button.\n\n550\n00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.470\nOr, I can simply click it and\n\n551\n00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.890\ndrag it to the recycle bin\nwhich I had to move from here.\n\n552\n00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.960\nSo there are many ways of\nplaying around with a file.\n\n553\n00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.690\nIf I wanted to know more about the file\nI could locate the properties.\n\n554\n00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.210\nOther options of things I can do here.\n\n555\n00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.270\nI can open it,\nI can print it I can edit it.\n\n556\n00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.310\nMeans it will open up and\nthen I will make edits on it.\n\n557\n00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.590\nI can compress it.\n\n558\n00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.760\nI can convert it into\na different file like a PDF.\n\n559\n00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.400\nI can create a shortcut.\n\n560\n00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:40.890\nShortcuts are very useful so\nlet's say that folder and\n\n561\n00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:46.670\nthen I right click it and\nthen say well, I want to send to\n\n562\n00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.890\nwhere, to desktop, there's a shortcut.\n\n563\n00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:55.740\nShortcut therefore means the document\nhasn't moved through the desktop.\n\n564\n00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:00.170\nWhat basically has happened,\nis I've been given an easy access,\n\n565\n00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:05.330\na pass that just by looking at it,\nI can point to the actual document.\n\n566\n00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:10.330\nSo if I open it, it doesn't mean that it\nis a new document that is on the desktop.\n\n567\n00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.880\nSo, this is just a pointer\nto the actual document.\n\n568\n00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.420\nSo, there are many,\nmany things that we can learn that,\n\n569\n00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.090\nyou know, time doesn't allow\nus to explore all of them.\n\n570\n00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.050\nWe are here to give you a glimpse and\nexcite you, so\n\n571\n00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.970\nthat you can explore with\na lot more confidence.\n\n572\n00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.110\nI'm very sure, Ronnie, there are a few\nmore things you may wanna say.\n\n573\n00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.170\n>> Well, when we start taking a look\nat this idea of the management, and\n\n574\n00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.540\nsome of the things that we can do.\n\n575\n00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.710\nThe operating system is what\nyou're going to be working in\n\n576\n00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.648\npretty much just about every day.\n\n577\n00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:39.050\nThen you're gonna get familiar of course,\n\n578\n00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:42.070\nwith applications that you'll also see,\nas well and\n\n579\n00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.770\nwe actually do have other episodes\nin which you'll be able to do that.\n\n580\n00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:48.820\nBut just take a look, make sure you feel\ncomfortable in navigating around and\n\n581\n00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.200\ntrying to search around this operating\nsystem, so it doesn't seem foreign to you\n\n582\n00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.210\nwhen you actually think about this\nwhen you do get into a job or\n\n583\n00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.540\nwhen you are at work and you're saying, \"I\nwonder what this does?\" Well hopefully Dr.\n\n584\n00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.550\nTani has showed you where\nyou can explore and\n\n585\n00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:06.550\nnot create too much havoc at the same\ntime because you actually do know\n\n586\n00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.640\nwhere you were going and\nwhat you're actually looking at.\n\n587\n00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.630\nBut that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n588\n00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:15.430\nSigning off for ITV Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n589\n00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:19.900\n>> And my name is Doctor learning\ntogether about Windows 7.\n\n590\n00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:25.205\n>> All right, stay tuned right here for\nmore computing fundamentals.\n\n591\n00:34:25.205 --> 00:34:30.175\n[SOUND]\n\n",

and\n\n3\n00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:20.870\nyou're watching\nthe Computing Fundamentals Ic3 Show.\n\n4\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.680\nWhere we're about to get in to something\na little bit more challenging.\n\n5\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.210\nWe're already talked about the basics of\nWindows 7 and the operating system and\n\n6\n00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.510\ngetting used to and\nthe idea working with the 7, but\n\n7\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.850\nthere's sometime we actually need to learn\na little bit more about Windows 7, and\n\n8\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.500\nwith us today is Dr. Tommy Anuanza.\n\n9\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.401\nWelcome back sir, how are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:44.270\n>> Very well indeed and\nthank very much for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.880\nWe covered some little ground in previous\nepisodes introducing ourselves to\n\n12\n00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.950\nthe Windows 7 now I want to\nstart manipulating Windows 7,\n\n13\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.540\nmaking a few changes.\n\n14\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.820\nAdministering it, maintaining it and\nthat's where we're about to begin Lory.\n\n15\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.560\n>> And there is something that actually\ngoes with the use of the operating system\n\n16\n00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.380\nthat most of the time as us as\npeople right, as we use our\n\n17\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.777\ncomputers we do not tend to think about\nthe idea that there has to be maintenance,\n\n18\n00:01:10.777 --> 00:01:15.290\nthat helps the operating system continue\nto operate the way that it does.\n\n19\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.710\nAnd then, there's also some\nadministrative features in there,\n\n20\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.290\nespecially when your work in\na regular office environment,\n\n21\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.130\nthat allows you to be able to keep your\nfiles separated out from other people's,\n\n22\n00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.000\nas well as allow us to connect to other\ndevices that are out there, as well.\n\n23\n00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.270\nAnd today, we are learning more\nabout that administrative side and\n\n24\n00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.260\nthat maintenance side of\nthings inside of Windows 7.\n\n25\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.700\nSo Doctor Tani, where do we need to begin?\n\n26\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.675\n>> Right, so we have an idea of\nthe three things that we're going to do.\n\n27\n00:01:43.675 --> 00:01:47.200\nFirst this thinking about user accounts.\n\n28\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.910\nHow to create accounts, manage these\naccounts, put in all the controls that\n\n29\n00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.750\nare on the accounts so\nthat we can know who can do what, where.\n\n30\n00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.180\nWe also need to learn about system\nutilities that help us to maintain,\n\n31\n00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.080\nbecause administration has a lot to do\nwith trying to figure out who can do what,\n\n32\n00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.630\nwhere, when.\n\n33\n00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.820\nThen system utilities enable us to kind of\nprovide some kind of maintenance features,\n\n34\n00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.590\nyou know like clean up things,\norganize things, restore things.\n\n35\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.420\nAnd then the last thing we're gonna spend\na little bit of time is troubleshooting.\n\n36\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.700\nCuz sometimes not everything works as\nyou had imagined or as you had planned.\n\n37\n00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.440\nAnd all over sudden the computer doesn't\nbehave the way you expected it to behave.\n\n38\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440\nAnd you can troubleshoot.\n\n39\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.560\nYou don't always have to call an expert or\n\n40\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.700\ntake it back to the supplier because\nsomething didn't work as expected.\n\n41\n00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.930\nThere's some of these things that\nyou can actually troubleshoot.\n\n42\n00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.700\nSo those are some of the main\nthings that we'll talk about in\n\n43\n00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.300\nthis particular episode.\n\n44\n00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.330\nAnd for me, I kind of think\nthe first place I want to start from\n\n45\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.830\nis thinking about user accounts.\n\n46\n00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.810\nSo, think about it this way.\n\n47\n00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.670\nIf you're in an institution, not everyone\nhas a key to every office, right?\n\n48\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.350\nSo people have keys to specific rooms,\n\n49\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.270\ndepending on the right,\nthey have to access those rooms,\n\n50\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.240\nthe kinds of activities that they're\ngoing to conduct in those rooms.\n\n51\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.500\nBut I get the sense that\nthere is normally one person\n\n52\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.605\nat least who has a key to every place.\n\n53\n00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:20.680\n[LAUGH] In the event that\nthere is a problem or\n\n54\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.460\nsomeone is coming over the weekend and\n\n55\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.840\nthen you should do something, they need\nto be able to access certain rooms.\n\n56\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.400\nSo they have some kind of master keys that\nthey can use to access almost everywhere.\n\n57\n00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.410\nSo people who are privileged enough\nthat they can access almost everything.\n\n58\n00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.870\nBut then at the same time there\nare things which are a lot personal.\n\n59\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.860\nSo even when they have rights for\neverything, they also have a little bit of\n\n60\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.400\ncontrol here and\nthere as to what exactly they can see.\n\n61\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.562\nSo that's where I think we\nare gonna start, Ronnie.\n\n62\n00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:53.400\nAll right, so when we start taking\na look at that particular idea,\n\n63\n00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.430\nwe're going to start talking about\nthe concept here, of course, of\n\n64\n00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.130\ndifferent types of user accounts, as well\nas creating the idea of user accounts.\n\n65\n00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.510\nAnd so when we begin, we need to start\ntaking a look at this idea that there is\n\n66\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.940\nthat, the way that Doctor Tani described,\nthe one that has all the keys.\n\n67\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.010\nThat there is a special type\nof account inside of Windows\n\n68\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.870\nthat has what we call\nadministrative privileges and\n\n69\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.400\nthen there is pretty much the rest\nus that we have standard accounts.\n\n70\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.820\nSo what do we need to\nlearn about this here?\n\n71\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.050\n>> All right, so having separating\nthe two, there is the administrator and\n\n72\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.850\nthere is standard user.\n\n73\n00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.750\nSo the administrator has pretty\nmuch rights about everything and\n\n74\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.950\nthat administrator is the one that's going\nto create accounts for standard users.\n\n75\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.330\nBut then also, that administrator has\nrights to even create other administrators\n\n76\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.150\ndepending on what functionality\ndo these people need to have.\n\n77\n00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.690\nBecause you know, you don't want to be\ncalling the same person all the time.\n\n78\n00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.590\nCreate for me a user, we got a new\nemployee, you got a new user here.\n\n79\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.490\nSo sometimes you can have\nmore than one administrator.\n\n80\n00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.580\nSo what I have done on my computer now is,\n\n81\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.530\nI have given some kind of\nan indication of how to get there.\n\n82\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.570\nSo if I go to start button and\nI click control panel.\n\n83\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.560\nI get a sense of some of the things that I\ncan do from an administrative perspective.\n\n84\n00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.020\nI can see something about\nthe system security.\n\n85\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.560\nI can see something about the network and\nInternet, something about hardware and\n\n86\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.630\nsound.\n\n87\n00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.760\nI can do a program and installation, if I\nwant to remove programs from my computer.\n\n88\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.840\nThere is something about user accounts and\nfamily safety.\n\n89\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.780\nI really like that part, family safety.\n\n90\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.730\nIt means that we can all\nbe using this computer, and\n\n91\n00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.000\nwe need to introduce safety for\nfamily members.\n\n92\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.650\nand then there's a PRS in paternalization.\n\n93\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.870\nWe spoke about paternalization\nin a previous edition,\n\n94\n00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.660\nthinking about how do you customize so\n\n95\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.650\nthat the computer looks the way you\nwant and function the way you want.\n\n96\n00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.980\nSomething to do with clock, language, and\nregion, and finally this ease of access.\n\n97\n00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.950\nNow, right up here,\n\n98\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.850\nthere's an opportunity to organize\nthese things in different ways.\n\n99\n00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.720\nIt depends on what\nyou're comfortable with.\n\n100\n00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.880\nIf you click large icons, and\nthen it reorganizes the whole thing and\n\n101\n00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.570\nthen you have an opportunity now,\nin a more granular level,\n\n102\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.100\nto look at different things.\n\n103\n00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.280\nFor example, I want to focus on the mouse.\n\n104\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.660\nMaybe I need to learn some\nspecifications about the mouse, or\n\n105\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.510\nI want to go to the system or I want\nto do some recovery of something, or\n\n106\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.750\nI want to go to the sound,\nall those options exist.\n\n107\n00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.760\nOr I can look at this as small icons and\nthen, the font is smaller and\n\n108\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.070\nthe icons are smaller.\n\n109\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.130\nSo let me just go back to\nthe category label and\n\n110\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.780\nthen I click user accounts and\nfamily safety.\n\n111\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.060\nSo I have got a menu here\nthat I could pick, but\n\n112\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.040\nnow it's just taking me\nstraight to the user accounts.\n\n113\n00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.270\nAnd there's some things I can\nsee here that are interesting.\n\n114\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.166\nOne is that I can change a user.\n\n115\n00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:49.890\nI can change a picture of a user.\n\n116\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.320\nI can share, add and remove user accounts.\n\n117\n00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.480\nAnd then I can change\nyour windows password.\n\n118\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.060\nNow, I am the administrator in this case.\n\n119\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.380\nI have an opportunity to\nchange your pass word.\n\n120\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.110\nPassword is you know or\nmay not use control and\n\n121\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.140\nhelp to identify the authenticity of\nthe person who is accessing that computer.\n\n122\n00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.100\nSo, it is something that I know, and\n\n123\n00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.390\nI don't give out my\npassword to someone else.\n\n124\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.450\nWe'll talk about passwords a little later\nin terms of the strength of password.\n\n125\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.860\nNot all passwords are good passwords.\n\n126\n00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.165\nLike you don't want\na password that says 12345.\n\n127\n00:07:28.165 --> 00:07:30.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That sounds like somebody can\n\n128\n00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.490\neasily predict it or\ncan just even a child can press around and\n\n129\n00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.695\nguess around then all of\na sudden they use it.\n\n130\n00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:39.645\nYou want to make a password\na little bit complicated, but\n\n131\n00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:43.715\nnot too complicated that again it becomes\nvery difficult even for you to remember.\n\n132\n00:07:43.715 --> 00:07:48.515\nSo you want a password that you can\nidentify with, but it's complex enough.\n\n133\n00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:51.383\nAnd complexity here has to do with,\n\n134\n00:07:51.383 --> 00:07:55.982\nyou wanna have not a very\npredictable set of characters.\n\n135\n00:07:55.982 --> 00:08:01.144\nYou can use words yes, but you can\ncompound them by adding numbers and\n\n136\n00:08:01.144 --> 00:08:04.081\nspecial characters in between there.\n\n137\n00:08:04.081 --> 00:08:07.084\nLike an @ sign Or an sign.\n\n138\n00:08:07.084 --> 00:08:12.890\nYou can reorder things so\nthat the words are not very predictable.\n\n139\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.280\nMake it something you can relate with,\nand then make it a little difficult,\n\n140\n00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.340\nthat people can't just\nguess it very quickly.\n\n141\n00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.040\nAnd every so often, you can change\nthe password because sometimes,\n\n142\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.200\npeople might have seen you type it and\nthey've kind of memorized.\n\n143\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.600\nOr somebody just figured\nout your password somehow.\n\n144\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.400\nSo it's always a good habit to also\nchange your password every so often.\n\n145\n00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.090\nSo let's see, I can add a user here.\n\n146\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.110\nSo let me add or remove a user, and then\n\n147\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.060\nall of a sudden my computer has brought me\nto the existing users of this computer.\n\n148\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.080\nIt's a personal computer.\n\n149\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.890\nI had an option,\nI could have renamed this name.\n\n150\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.700\nSo currently it looks as HP, but\nreally means this is this computer and\n\n151\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.975\nI was just playing around, I created\na standard user a few seconds ago.\n\n152\n00:08:57.975 --> 00:09:00.540\nIt just doesn't haven't have any meaning,\n\n153\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.690\nI just said MMM as a potential user,\nthen I also have a guest here.\n\n154\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.100\nSo let me just say I wanna create a new\nuser, then it ask me for the names.\n\n155\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.290\nI say, well I think Ronnie\ncan become a new user here.\n\n156\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.560\nI have a choice of making Ronnie\na standard user or an administrator.\n\n157\n00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.870\nAnd in this case,\n\n158\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.975\nit's a question of a functionality\nthat these two people can do.\n\n159\n00:09:21.975 --> 00:09:27.355\nThe standard user will be limited in\nterms of what they can do, the scope\n\n160\n00:09:27.355 --> 00:09:32.175\nis a little smaller administrator has\na complete access with the computer and\n\n161\n00:09:32.175 --> 00:09:36.025\nthey can do virtually anything on that\ncomputer, they can install things there,\n\n162\n00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:39.535\nthey can uninstall things,\nthey can create new user etc.\n\n163\n00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:44.200\nSo you want to be sure that Ronnie should\nbe that kind of pattern, isn't it?\n\n164\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.214\nSo lets say it's a standard user, and\nthen I say create account and I wait.\n\n165\n00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:53.530\nAlready it is created.\n\n166\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.590\nRonnie right here is a standard user.\n\n167\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:02.840\nSo let's say I also had Ronnie2 and I\nwant that Ronnie2 to be an administrator.\n\n168\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.570\nIt's just that simple.\n\n169\n00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.008\nNow I have Ronnie and Ronnie2 and\nthey are different kinds of users.\n\n170\n00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:13.267\nAs you can tell, it's automatically\ncreating the image for that person, so\n\n171\n00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:17.391\nI could very easily click one of them,\nand say well, I can change the name,\n\n172\n00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:19.440\nI can create a password.\n\n173\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.210\nI can change the picture, I can set up\nsome parental controls which will limit,\n\n174\n00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.450\nsometimes if it's a child and you really\nwant to have a limit as to how long can\n\n175\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.320\na user use a computer,\nyou can limit the amount of time.\n\n176\n00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.630\nYou don't want a child to be\non computer the whole day.\n\n177\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.130\nSo you can regulate a few things here and\nthere.\n\n178\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.870\nYou can change the type and\n\n179\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.470\nyou can convert someone from\na standard user to an administrator.\n\n180\n00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.190\nYou can delete that account if you\nfeel you don't need that account.\n\n181\n00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.570\nSo the good thing about this account is\nnow when you give a password to someone.\n\n182\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.160\nThey will have the opportunity\nto change their own password.\n\n183\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.750\nSo, if I'm creeping and I say I wanna\nput for you a password here and\n\n184\n00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.070\nI give you that password.\n\n185\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.830\nSo, when that password logs into the\ncomputer they can change that password so\n\n186\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.730\nthat it is personal.\n\n187\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:09.540\nAnd then from their they can\nconfigure the to computer personal,\n\n188\n00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.120\nso they can change the background,\n\n189\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.390\nthey can move forward [INAUDIBLE] there\nand then they have their own account.\n\n190\n00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:22.450\nSo really, encrypting is just beyond\njust a simple username and password.\n\n191\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.010\nIt's actually identifying an individual\nwith that computer and giving them\n\n192\n00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:32.570\nthe freedom to organize things in their\nown space the best way they want and\n\n193\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:37.880\nwhenever they log in they always\nfind their design awaiting them.\n\n194\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.970\nExactly as they left it so there is no\nclash between different kinds of users.\n\n195\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.330\nI hope that's a useful function\nthat you may want to consider.\n\n196\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.550\nWhen we go to the stat button now,\n\n197\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.550\nif I want to see how is this\norganized at the point of logging in,\n\n198\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:12:00.270\nI can go to the switch user option and\nthen the switch user option.\n\n199\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.980\nWait a minute.\n\n200\n00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.530\nRight there.\n\n201\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.840\nSo my computer now has all those options.\n\n202\n00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.740\nI'm the one who is logged in as HP and\nthere was one created here.\n\n203\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.920\nI created Ronnie and Ronnie 2, and if I\nnow I begin to click any of them I can go\n\n204\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.720\nlog in as that particular person and\nthen do all my setups and\n\n205\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.650\nthe computer will configure everything\nthat I need in order to get started.\n\n206\n00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.920\nI hope that's a useful function Ronnie.\n\n207\n00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.960\n>> It really is a useful function\nwhether you're at home or\n\n208\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.910\nwhether you're inside of a business.\n\n209\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.690\nIt's a very useful function.\n\n210\n00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.340\nThis way when you're at home, every\nindividual person in your house can use\n\n211\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.140\nthe same computer, but without actually\ninterfering with somebody else's\n\n212\n00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.850\ninformation or\nfiles that they're working on.\n\n213\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.440\nOne of the most frustrating things is for\nyou to come back and\n\n214\n00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.610\nrealize all your icons on your\ndesktop have changed locations\n\n215\n00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.480\nbecause somebody else has actually been\nmessing around with your computer,\n\n216\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.870\nplaying around on it, using your account.\n\n217\n00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:01.370\nBy separating these things out, it gives\nyou the ability to control the access that\n\n218\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.790\nthey have to your information, and\nthen allows them to actually create their\n\n219\n00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:09.495\nown information in their own storage,\nand they will not mingle together or\n\n220\n00:13:09.495 --> 00:13:12.960\nco-mingle, so that you don't have to\nworry about filtering them out for\n\n221\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.390\nwhat you have as well.\n\n222\n00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.580\nThe idea the standard user\nof course limits them\n\n223\n00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.430\nto the ability to be able to install\nprograms in to that computer and\n\n224\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.090\nyou might be wondering why\nis that actually necessary?\n\n225\n00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.970\nBecause sometimes every user\nthat comes on to your computer\n\n226\n00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.160\ncannot tell the difference between\nthe bad program and a good program.\n\n227\n00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.980\nSo in other words,\n\n228\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.920\nmalicious software or adware or malware,\nwhatever terminology that you use for\n\n229\n00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.070\nit, somebody could accidentally go ahead\nand install that onto the computer.\n\n230\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.940\nBy limiting it to that standard user\naccount, well, it actually requires them,\n\n231\n00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.830\nthen, before they install\nsomething onto the computer\n\n232\n00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:56.170\nthat will change the operating system,\nit requires them to go on ask\n\n233\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.680\nsomeone with a administrative\nprivilege to do so.\n\n234\n00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.890\nSo, that is really kind of the big\nlimitations on those standard users.\n\n235\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.530\nBut keeping that separate is one of\nthe key elements that you will have and\n\n236\n00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.810\nDoctor Tawny also shared one\nof the most important things,\n\n237\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.590\ndo not ever give out\nyour password to anyone.\n\n238\n00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.850\nRegardless of what the password is,\n\n239\n00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.170\nmake complex passwords, but\ndon't give it to anyone.\n\n240\n00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.960\nAnd that will actually help\nyou out quite in the majority\n\n241\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.020\nof the time when we start\nthinking about it as well.\n\n242\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.590\nWell, Doctor Tawny, there are some other\nadministrative functions that are really\n\n243\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.840\ndesigned more for the home usage such\nas even some of the parental controls\n\n244\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.340\nthat you were mentioning and they do\nhelp us to limit quite a bit, right?\n\n245\n00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.040\n>> That's true,\nyou can limit how much time people\n\n246\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.550\nhave access too a computer,\nthat's for domestic use,.\n\n247\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.200\n>> Mm hm.\n>> In such a case.\n\n248\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.640\nWhen you buy a computer and\n\n249\n00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.090\nyou have it at home, probably you only\nhave one laptop or something, or a PC.\n\n250\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.310\nEverybody really gets excited.\n\n251\n00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.990\nThey want to do their own work and so\nyou create accounts and you say so and so\n\n252\n00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.980\nis gonna access this, you should be\nable to do it, and that's fine, so\n\n253\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.800\nwe're all happy.\n\n254\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.610\nSo people create their own backgrounds and\ntheir own templates but\n\n255\n00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:17.110\nthe next thing is we just discover that\nsome people are not effectively and\n\n256\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.370\nappropriately using this kind of tool.\n\n257\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:26.440\nSo you find probably people play some kind\nof music that you're not comfortable with.\n\n258\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.310\nOr they're watching\ncertain kinds of things\n\n259\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.060\nthat you're not very comfortable with.\n\n260\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.620\nYou can get a chance, or some people\naccidentally accessing some material\n\n261\n00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.700\nthat you don't think it's appropriate.\n\n262\n00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.670\nSo children,\n\n263\n00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.740\nyou wanna regulate, some people might\nnot be able to regulate themselves.\n\n264\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.150\nThey may not have that capacity\nto regulate themselves.\n\n265\n00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:52.580\nSo there's the option of managing\nthe access in terms of what and when.\n\n266\n00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.799\nSo that's where the parental\ncontrols come in.\n\n267\n00:15:54.799 --> 00:15:58.566\nAnd you can make those\nconditions as to which days,\n\n268\n00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:02.345\nwhich time can people access And\nso on and so forth.\n\n269\n00:16:02.345 --> 00:16:06.855\nAnd that's a useful tool because\nyou can negotiate and agree or\n\n270\n00:16:06.855 --> 00:16:11.536\nyou can kind of create some guidelines\nof usage of this particular\n\n271\n00:16:11.536 --> 00:16:14.700\nresource where you have\na sense of control.\n\n272\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:20.270\nBecause technology is good but\nat the same time when it's not\n\n273\n00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:24.832\nmoderately and appropriately used,\nit can become a bother.\n\n274\n00:16:24.832 --> 00:16:28.720\n>> There is no doubt about that, so these\npicker of controls really do help us out,\n\n275\n00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.160\nespecially when we do have again,\nchildren in the home.\n\n276\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.860\nWe can limit them either by the time or\n\n277\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.080\nmaybe a particular application that we\ndon't want that user to be able to access\n\n278\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.380\nor even based off a voluntary rating\nsystem that's also out there.\n\n279\n00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.340\nWindows 7 can really help you to do that\nif you choose to implement those controls.\n\n280\n00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.860\nNow along with that, an administrative\nfeature that you do tend to have just\n\n281\n00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:57.594\ninside of a business, is gonna be working\nwith the file and folder permissions too.\n\n282\n00:16:57.594 --> 00:16:59.499\nDr. Tonny,\nwhat do we need to understand here?\n\n283\n00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:06.170\n>> Files and folders, in a work\nenvironment, we don't always want\n\n284\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.140\npeople to do anything and everything\nthat they want on a particular file.\n\n285\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.890\nIt depends on the kind of work.\n\n286\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:18.619\nWhen we were running through the Microsoft\nepisode, we spoke about passwords.\n\n287\n00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:23.159\nSo every time you save a document,\nyou can choose to introduce a password,\n\n288\n00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:28.020\nwhich therefore limits people either\nopening it or making changes on it.\n\n289\n00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.700\nSo you can actually have\ndifferent levels of controls.\n\n290\n00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.150\nYou can say, I don't want anyone to open.\n\n291\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.420\nI'm the only one who opens.\n\n292\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:39.130\nOr I want people to open but they can't\nmake a change, and things like that.\n\n293\n00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.990\nThat's at the file level,\nat the creation of the file level.\n\n294\n00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:46.863\nBut then also at the operating system\nlevel, you can also put controls, and\n\n295\n00:17:46.863 --> 00:17:50.611\nsay, I want people to only see\ncertain kind of documents.\n\n296\n00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:54.597\nI only want to be able to make changes\non certain kind of documents, so\n\n297\n00:17:54.597 --> 00:17:56.552\nthat also brings a control.\n\n298\n00:17:56.552 --> 00:17:59.860\nBut inasmuch as people have\naccess to particular files and\n\n299\n00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:05.650\nfolders, there are controls as to who\ncan do what, when, on a particular file.\n\n300\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.632\nAll right, so as we continue to\nsee that there's actually many\n\n301\n00:18:08.632 --> 00:18:11.389\nof these different types of\ncontrols that are available,\n\n302\n00:18:11.389 --> 00:18:14.876\nnot only can we do that, we can also\nadd in that encryption that we've also\n\n303\n00:18:14.876 --> 00:18:18.532\ntalked about in a previous episode as well\nas do some of the things that the file\n\n304\n00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:21.549\nsystem's actually designed for\nus to be able to take a look at.\n\n305\n00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:24.144\nNow when we start moving\ninto the maintenance\n\n306\n00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:27.830\nside of different things inside\nof Windows 7, this is actually\n\n307\n00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.925\na whole set of different system\nutilities that we have available to us,\n\n308\n00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:35.440\nthat we need to at least\nunderstand what they're there for.\n\n309\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.480\nWe may not ever really run them too often\nunless we start running into problems but\n\n310\n00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.310\nit is actually good for\nus to know what's available to us.\n\n311\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.086\nSo Dr. Tonny,\n\n312\n00:18:44.086 --> 00:18:47.499\nwhat do we need to understand about\nsome of these system utilities?\n\n313\n00:18:47.499 --> 00:18:50.155\nI think the first place to start is that,\n\n314\n00:18:50.155 --> 00:18:53.705\nwe need to understand what\nthe computer is all about.\n\n315\n00:18:53.705 --> 00:18:58.670\nLike last time in the previous episode,\nwe illustrated this another way.\n\n316\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.200\nYou go to your computer and you look\nat the properties of the computer and\n\n317\n00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.051\nall of a sudden, you can tell it is\nrunning in Windows 7 Professional.\n\n318\n00:19:08.051 --> 00:19:14.250\nThis is the manufacturer, this is\nthe memory capacity, and things like that.\n\n319\n00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.605\nThere are additional features that can\nenable you to access this computer and\n\n320\n00:19:18.605 --> 00:19:22.233\nmake different kind of modifications,\nyou're maintaining.\n\n321\n00:19:22.233 --> 00:19:23.757\nAnd why are you maintaining?\n\n322\n00:19:23.757 --> 00:19:27.465\nYou are maintaining because something\ncan happen to the computer and\n\n323\n00:19:27.465 --> 00:19:29.990\nyou need to see that changes\nthat have happened and\n\n324\n00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:35.330\ntherefore you possibly need to restore.\n\n325\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.010\nFor example,\nsomebody has installed something and\n\n326\n00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.810\nthen over time you just realize now the\ncomputer's not functioning as I expected.\n\n327\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.960\nI want to go to that previous state,\nso I can go to that state.\n\n328\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.870\nThere are other scenarios.\n\n329\n00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:53.679\nYou might say, well, I think because\nof the way the computer works\n\n330\n00:19:53.679 --> 00:20:00.765\ninternally is that files are stored in\ncertain systematic steps and locations.\n\n331\n00:20:00.765 --> 00:20:05.355\nAnd so sometimes the operating system\ndoesn't find this space that is\n\n332\n00:20:05.355 --> 00:20:09.712\nto continue storing a particular file or\ndocument and therefore,\n\n333\n00:20:09.712 --> 00:20:12.228\nit stores it in a different location.\n\n334\n00:20:12.228 --> 00:20:18.645\nSo over time, as different documents move\naround at the operating system level,\n\n335\n00:20:18.645 --> 00:20:22.690\nat the memory level, okay fine,\nthings kind of start getting a little bit\n\n336\n00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.460\ninefficient and you want these things\nto be stored in a very systematic way.\n\n337\n00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:32.200\nSo at some point in time it becomes\nnecessary to compress documents.\n\n338\n00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:38.540\nIt becomes necessary to redistribute or\ncheck for errors in the disk.\n\n339\n00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:43.634\nSo there are tools that are useful for\nchecking for errors.\n\n340\n00:20:43.634 --> 00:20:48.446\nThere are several other tools that you\ncan use to defragment in that case when I\n\n341\n00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:53.335\ndescribed where data keeps moving around\nand then you need to restore things,\n\n342\n00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.980\nso you can use defragmenting tools.\n\n343\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.090\nIt may sound like, okay,\nsomething must have become fragmented or\n\n344\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.720\nsomething like that because of\nthe way the computer works.\n\n345\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.810\nSo then we use the tool to do that\nkind of defragmenting and restoring.\n\n346\n00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:13.048\nSo the other kind of tools in there, tools\nthat you can use to compress files and\n\n347\n00:21:13.048 --> 00:21:15.670\nmake sure they take less space,\nand similar.\n\n348\n00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.560\nThere are several other tools\nthat we could talk about.\n\n349\n00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.070\nI don't know if, Ronnie,\nyou remember any other tool?\n\n350\n00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.760\n>> Well, there are other tools that are\navailable, but they're all located inside\n\n351\n00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.070\nof that control panel option that Dr.\nOmwansa was showing us.\n\n352\n00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:32.450\nUsually the tools that we really need\nto focus in on are these tools that we\n\n353\n00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.520\njust mentioned.\n\n354\n00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.060\nThe idea of understanding that when the\nperformance of the computer begins to slow\n\n355\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.140\ndown, these are some of the tools\nthat we may think about.\n\n356\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.610\nThe other administrative side of things,\nnormally as a regular user on the computer\n\n357\n00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.720\nand we're working for a company, we\nnormally don't have to worry about that.\n\n358\n00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.790\nIn other words,\nsomebody else worries about that.\n\n359\n00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.802\nAnd then we just have to follow\nwhatever limitations that are there.\n\n360\n00:21:52.802 --> 00:21:56.734\nBut if you're at home, you may choose\nto set some of these things up and\n\n361\n00:21:56.734 --> 00:21:59.200\neven some of the maintenance things.\n\n362\n00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.824\nIn a regular work environment, they\nalready may have this set up on a schedule\n\n363\n00:22:03.824 --> 00:22:07.040\nin which you do not have\nto worry about it as well.\n\n364\n00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.230\nBut it is nice for you to understand\nthat it is available to you,\n\n365\n00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:15.252\nif you start realizing your home computer\nis starting to fail or starting to\n\n366\n00:22:15.252 --> 00:22:20.420\nfall a little bit, slower or starting to\nmove not as quickly as you'd like it to.\n\n367\n00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.010\nBy understanding some of these\ntools that are available out there,\n\n368\n00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.190\nit's going to help you out as well.\n\n369\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.430\nSo one of the other options\nthat we have here, of course,\n\n370\n00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:33.000\nis the idea of taking a look at\nworking with printers as well.\n\n371\n00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.040\nSo Dr. Tonny, what's really left?\n\n372\n00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.610\nWe've talked about printers before but\nwhat do we need to understand at this\n\n373\n00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.031\npoint in terms of maintenance or\nadministration?\n\n374\n00:22:41.031 --> 00:22:41.711\n>> You see,\n\n375\n00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:47.610\na printer is connected as an external\ndevice connected to your computer.\n\n376\n00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.290\nSo what that means is that it\ncould have been installed.\n\n377\n00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:54.040\nAnd at the point of installation,\na driver may have been used.\n\n378\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.570\nAt some point in time,\nmaybe drivers need updates and\n\n379\n00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:02.070\nthat can happen or\nsometimes we need to remove a printer.\n\n380\n00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:07.210\nAnd we need to change a printer and\nthen we install a different printer.\n\n381\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:13.630\nOr sometimes you may realize you have\nmore than one printer and you need\n\n382\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.460\nto have a default printer that every time\nyou send a document, you don't necessarily\n\n383\n00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.380\nhave to keep on selecting which printer\nyou want that document to go to.\n\n384\n00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.760\nSo you can set a default\nprinter that by default,\n\n385\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.700\nthat's the one that will always\nprint the document if you just click\n\n386\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.600\nthe Print button without\nnecessarily selecting the printer.\n\n387\n00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.161\nYou can have more than one\nprinter on a computer.\n\n388\n00:23:37.161 --> 00:23:40.960\nPersonally I have one printer at home and\nanother printer in the office.\n\n389\n00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.110\nSo when I move with my printer every\ntime I connect, I can make a selection.\n\n390\n00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.219\nThe one that I used lastly,\nis the one that is my default printer.\n\n391\n00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:54.615\nSo that is something I can do for\nthe purpose of maintaining, and you\n\n392\n00:23:54.615 --> 00:24:00.690\ncan check how the printer is performing\nwhen you send things to the printer.\n\n393\n00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.675\nAnd sometimes you send, and\n\n394\n00:24:02.675 --> 00:24:07.180\nmaybe there was something that had\nbeen sent and is in the queue.\n\n395\n00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.690\nBecause the printer doesn't work\nnecessarily at the same speed\n\n396\n00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.100\nthe computer works.\n\n397\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.770\nAnd sometimes we're sharing a printer,\nand so\n\n398\n00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.880\nwe're five people who are all\nusing the same printer.\n\n399\n00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.429\nSo when you send something, you might want\nto, but my document has not printed, and\n\n400\n00:24:22.429 --> 00:24:25.537\nI can see other documents that\nhave been printed over there.\n\n401\n00:24:25.537 --> 00:24:28.047\nIt's because things are queued and\n\n402\n00:24:28.047 --> 00:24:32.988\nthey're all going to be printed in\nthe sequence of which they arrive.\n\n403\n00:24:32.988 --> 00:24:36.374\nSo you can go and\ncheck the properties of that printer, and\n\n404\n00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:40.850\nsee okay, what's in the queue,\nwhen do I expect mine to come out.\n\n405\n00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.550\nAnd at that point in time you can say,\nmaybe I'm in a hurry.\n\n406\n00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.270\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\njust gonna cancel this print.\n\n407\n00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.980\nI'll probably go and print elsewhere,\nI don't want to wait.\n\n408\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.280\nSo you can cancel something that\nhas already gone to the printer.\n\n409\n00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.003\nSo you have that option.\n\n410\n00:24:56.003 --> 00:25:00.895\nSo how to do that is that all you need\nto do is go to the Control Panel.\n\n411\n00:25:00.895 --> 00:25:05.574\nBefore you get to that Control Panel,\nyou can see there is an option for\n\n412\n00:25:05.574 --> 00:25:07.174\nDevices and Printers.\n\n413\n00:25:07.174 --> 00:25:10.471\nYou can go to the Control Panel and\nfind your way to the printers as well.\n\n414\n00:25:10.471 --> 00:25:16.630\nBut if I click right now here, I have\na set of Devices and Printers loading.\n\n415\n00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.380\nSometimes the computer gets a little slow.\n\n416\n00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.790\nMaybe I need to defragment\nmine as well [LAUGH].\n\n417\n00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.850\nSo when they load,\nI'll have an opportunity to select\n\n418\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.300\nwhich kind of printer do I want\nto make a default printer,\n\n419\n00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.160\nwhich one do I want to be non-default.\n\n420\n00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.450\nAnd as you can see right here,\nI've got a set of devices and\n\n421\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:41.250\nI've got a set of printers which include a\nfax, I didn't install all these printers.\n\n422\n00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:46.174\nThe one with the green tick over\nhere is considered the default.\n\n423\n00:25:46.174 --> 00:25:50.756\nBut if I come here and\nclick this, HP laserjet 3390,\n\n424\n00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:55.536\nI can right-click it and\nthen I say Set as Default Printer.\n\n425\n00:25:55.536 --> 00:25:58.140\nAnd then,\nnow that becomes my default printer,\n\n426\n00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.630\nthe green tick has already moved there.\n\n427\n00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.180\nIf I double click it,\n\n428\n00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.040\nit will give me a sense of some\nfeatures about that particular printer.\n\n429\n00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.510\nSo I can see, I want to know what is\nprinting, so I double-click this.\n\n430\n00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.530\nAnd now I can see,\nsomething was actually printing.\n\n431\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.450\nI had sent it, but then I disconnected\nbecause I was in a hurry, and\n\n432\n00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.350\ntherefore it didn't print.\n\n433\n00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:23.187\nAnd I could now click this particular\ndocument, right-click it and restart or\n\n434\n00:26:23.187 --> 00:26:25.292\npost or consolidate altogether.\n\n435\n00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:26.936\nAnd it'll ask me, are you sure?\n\n436\n00:26:26.936 --> 00:26:28.906\nAnd I'll say yes and it's gone.\n\n437\n00:26:28.906 --> 00:26:32.480\nSo then it means we'll never connect this\nthrough the printer, it won't print again.\n\n438\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.670\nThose are some of the things we need to\nthink about when maintaining the printer.\n\n439\n00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.820\n>> There's no doubt that\nas far as printers go,\n\n440\n00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.600\nwe do tend to see quite a few things.\n\n441\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.470\nBut overall though,\nthere's usually two mistakes that I make.\n\n442\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.868\nOne, is assuming that I've actually made\nthe default printer the right printer,\n\n443\n00:26:47.868 --> 00:26:50.000\ndepending on what network I'm on.\n\n444\n00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.010\nSo you always wanna think before\nyou hit the print button,\n\n445\n00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.020\nverify that you've connected\nto the right printer, as well.\n\n446\n00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.110\nThat's usually one of\nthe big ones that you have.\n\n447\n00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.800\nAnd then the second one is\nforgetting to turn the printer on,\n\n448\n00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.600\nat least in my instance here.\n\n449\n00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.689\nIs what I end up doing a lot of times is\njust not realizing that the printer was\n\n450\n00:27:05.689 --> 00:27:07.270\nturned off for one reason or another.\n\n451\n00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:11.606\nNow Dr. Tonny we do have a little bit to\ngo as far as what we're talking about in\n\n452\n00:27:11.606 --> 00:27:13.611\nmaintenance and administration,\n\n453\n00:27:13.611 --> 00:27:17.160\nwhich is moving into the idea\nof basic troubleshooting.\n\n454\n00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.570\nWindows 7 really does operate\nby itself fairly well without\n\n455\n00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.950\na lot of me having to day to\nday do some of these things.\n\n456\n00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.230\nBut we will encounter certain errors,\nright?\n\n457\n00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.908\n>> Yeah, you easily get into\ntrouble once in a while.\n\n458\n00:27:28.908 --> 00:27:30.800\nWell, not really in a bad way, but\n\n459\n00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.140\nsometimes the computer doesn't\nfunction as you expect it.\n\n460\n00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.390\nThere are scenarios where, for example,\nthe computer may not just start up\n\n461\n00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.704\ncorrectly, and all of a sudden you\nare wondering what's going on.\n\n462\n00:27:41.704 --> 00:27:47.298\nOr it's just looking a little sluggish,\nand it's taking time to open documents and\n\n463\n00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:50.750\nthat might be to do with the memory or\nthings like that.\n\n464\n00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.620\nOr just another message appears.\n\n465\n00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.090\nOr sometimes an application is taking\n\n466\n00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.790\na little too long to\nrespond to instructions.\n\n467\n00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:02.670\nOr it's simply just displaying and\nyou're trying to click and\n\n468\n00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.750\nnothing is really happening.\n\n469\n00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.008\nSo such instances do happen, and\n\n470\n00:28:06.008 --> 00:28:09.887\nwe've got different kinds of\nways of dealing with this.\n\n471\n00:28:09.887 --> 00:28:16.301\nI mean, the least of things that you can\ndo to solve this kind of problems is\n\n472\n00:28:16.301 --> 00:28:21.510\nmany and not always one particular\napproach makes it work.\n\n473\n00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.470\nSo you have to be prepared,\nat one point in time,\n\n474\n00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.410\nyou may have to restart the computer.\n\n475\n00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:27.300\nAt some point in time,\n\n476\n00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:32.070\nyou may have to deal with stopping\na particular application.\n\n477\n00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.100\nOr you might be thinking\nabout defragmenting.\n\n478\n00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.440\nSo first of all, don't panic.\n\n479\n00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.560\nI think that's the first thing.\n\n480\n00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.920\nCuz sometimes when we panic,\n\n481\n00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.630\nwe end up doing some things that end\nup messing the computer even further.\n\n482\n00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.560\nSo the first thing is to\nrealize that it can happen.\n\n483\n00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.600\nJust like you can get a cold or\na flu, it can happen, but\n\n484\n00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.130\nthat doesn't mean you're gonna be dead.\n\n485\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.540\nYou can just simply rest and\nyou can be fine.\n\n486\n00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.244\nSo in the context of the computer,\nyou wanna start asking yourself,\n\n487\n00:29:03.244 --> 00:29:07.940\nis it possibly a hardware problem or\na software problem?\n\n488\n00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:13.390\nCould it be a power related problem or\nan application kind of related problem?\n\n489\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:18.280\nFirst of all is to diagnose this,\nwhat do you think it possibly could be?\n\n490\n00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.524\nWhen you start seeing things slowing down,\nyou easily start thinking,\n\n491\n00:29:21.524 --> 00:29:23.079\nwell that could be either memory.\n\n492\n00:29:23.079 --> 00:29:29.090\nOr there's a possibility that there's\noveruse of certain resources.\n\n493\n00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:34.100\nAnd probably there's a bit of confusion in\nterms of how the resources are being used.\n\n494\n00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.720\nSo there may be specific things\nthat you could possibly do.\n\n495\n00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:42.170\nWe will list a few of them, for example,\nI can decide to shut down a program.\n\n496\n00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.450\nIf I want to shut down a program, I can\ngo ahead and click the cancel button or\n\n497\n00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:53.440\nclose button, right, at the top left,\nand I can restart it again.\n\n498\n00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.622\nBut sometimes I can click that one,\nand for some reason,\n\n499\n00:29:56.622 --> 00:30:00.790\nit's just not shutting down and\nI'm wondering, it's taking a bit too long.\n\n500\n00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:05.181\nSo there's some tricks that we can use,\nlike very famous Ctrl+Alt+Del.\n\n501\n00:30:05.181 --> 00:30:08.830\nSomebody will have to tell me,\nhow did that come about?\n\n502\n00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:15.730\nSo, if I click Ctrl+Alt+Del,\nI can say Ctrl+Alt+Del, then what happens?\n\n503\n00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:20.380\nOn my screen,\nI get to see options that have come up.\n\n504\n00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.390\nThere is an opportunity to lock\nthe computer, change the user, log off,\n\n505\n00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.830\nchange the password and Task Manager.\n\n506\n00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.890\nTask Manager is a very\npowerful tool that gets to\n\n507\n00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.640\ngive you a snapshot of how\nyour computer is performing.\n\n508\n00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.460\nSo if I click this,\nmaximize it just a little bit,\n\n509\n00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.530\nit gives me a sense of the applications\nthat are currently running.\n\n510\n00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:41.490\nI can see the processes.\n\n511\n00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:47.458\nAs you can tell, Chrome here, the exe,\nthere's several of them, how come?\n\n512\n00:30:47.458 --> 00:30:49.675\nI only opened it once, how come?\n\n513\n00:30:49.675 --> 00:30:52.669\nSo it means something is\nprobably not working right.\n\n514\n00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:58.573\nAnd remember, some of these are using some\nresources that I don't need to be used.\n\n515\n00:30:58.573 --> 00:31:00.623\nAnd I need to restart\nsome of these processes.\n\n516\n00:31:00.623 --> 00:31:04.683\nThe sense of performance over here is\ngiving you an indication of how the CPU is\n\n517\n00:31:04.683 --> 00:31:05.710\nperforming.\n\n518\n00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.810\nHow is it being used?\n\n519\n00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:07.500\nWhat percentage?\n\n520\n00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.930\nI can tell a sense of some of the users\nthat are currently using the computer.\n\n521\n00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.260\nSo it means for example, all of these\nusers are actually logged in but\n\n522\n00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.280\nthey were not all logged out and\nthat is potentially using some resources.\n\n523\n00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.518\nSo this is a very powerful tool that\nyou can get to see, like a snapshot,\n\n524\n00:31:24.518 --> 00:31:28.830\nlike a dashboard that gives you\na sense of what is the utilization.\n\n525\n00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.820\nSo if I decide, I think I need\nto shut some things here, so\n\n526\n00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.960\nI can come and click one of them and\nthen I end the process.\n\n527\n00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.910\nWhen I end that process,\nit's going to free up some space.\n\n528\n00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:46.120\nIf I say close, so some processing,\nat least, will be restored.\n\n529\n00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.085\nThe CPU now has less work to do.\n\n530\n00:31:48.085 --> 00:31:50.560\nSometimes it's burdened by a lot of work.\n\n531\n00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.550\nThat's a typical example\nof a tool we can use.\n\n532\n00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.547\nWe can talk a little bit about others,\nbut I don't know.\n\n533\n00:31:54.547 --> 00:31:58.216\nHave you had some experience working\nwith this particular tool of\n\n534\n00:31:58.216 --> 00:31:59.490\nthe Taskbar Manager?\n\n535\n00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:03.550\n>> [LAUGH] I have used it quite often\nin helping When somebody's computer has\n\n536\n00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.888\nactually kind of locked itself\nup where it couldn't work.\n\n537\n00:32:06.888 --> 00:32:10.550\nNow there's usually two types of errors\nin that in the operating system.\n\n538\n00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.223\nEither the entire Windows\nenvironment itself can't work.\n\n539\n00:32:14.223 --> 00:32:16.291\nAnd the way that you recognize\nthis is if you try and go and\n\n540\n00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:19.190\nclick on the Start button and\neven the Start button won't work.\n\n541\n00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.800\nBut normally, Windows 7 is so\n\n542\n00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.910\ngood at managing all of the resources\nthat are available to you.\n\n543\n00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:29.730\nUsually even if one application,\none tiny window locks up,\n\n544\n00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.430\nthe rest of the operating\nsystem still continues to work.\n\n545\n00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.640\nAnd that's what makes it so\ngood at what it does.\n\n546\n00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.683\nIf that one application stops working,\nwell, you can go and do what Dr.\n\n547\n00:32:39.683 --> 00:32:40.650\nTonny showed us.\n\n548\n00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:45.140\nWhich is to go into that taskbar and\ninto the Task Manager and\n\n549\n00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.680\nthen simply shut that program down.\n\n550\n00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.320\nAnd then when you relaunch it again,\n\n551\n00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.120\nyou might find everything actually works\nperfectly in the way that you want.\n\n552\n00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.160\nThe other thing that he mentioned at\nthe very beginning is what if it's\n\n553\n00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.560\nnot even going to allow you to\nboot up the computer itself.\n\n554\n00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.320\nThat's where you need to decide\nwhether it's a hardware issue versus\n\n555\n00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.740\na software issue.\n\n556\n00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.070\nAnd if you think that it's\nthe operating system,\n\n557\n00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:11.460\nthere is a mode that is called Safe Mode\nthat allows you to boot into it.\n\n558\n00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.830\nNow, it's a little bit tricky but\nit's fairly easy to do.\n\n559\n00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.500\nWhen the computer is off and\nas soon as you turn the power button on.\n\n560\n00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.850\nWhat you're waiting for is it for\n\n561\n00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.980\nit to get through its initial screen\nwhere you see a logo just kind of pop up.\n\n562\n00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:31.240\nBut before the Windows logo pops up, you\nneed to hit the F8 keyon your keyboard.\n\n563\n00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.010\nYou can just tap on it and that will\nlaunch you into what is called Safe Mode.\n\n564\n00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:41.301\nSafe Mode is Windows 7, but\nonly the most minimal version of Window 7,\n\n565\n00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:45.490\nit will look like a primary\nschool version of Windows 7.\n\n566\n00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:50.080\nNothing you want to work in, but\nif you know that you can get access there,\n\n567\n00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.780\nthat means that the operating\nsystem files itself are perfect.\n\n568\n00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.720\nAnd that normally leads you to\nbeing able to say all right,\n\n569\n00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.200\nif the operating system files are perfect.\n\n570\n00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:04.890\nThen something during start up that was\nloaded is imperfect, it is not working.\n\n571\n00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.170\nAnd this is where you can then just\nreboot and then you can go back and\n\n572\n00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.280\nuse that tool that Dr.\nTonny was talking about.\n\n573\n00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.140\nAgain, in the Task Manager, and\ngo in and look at the Startup tab.\n\n574\n00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.191\nAnd then simply uncheck\neach one of those or\n\n575\n00:34:18.191 --> 00:34:22.103\nyou can uncheck all of them and\nadd them in one at a time.\n\n576\n00:34:22.103 --> 00:34:25.784\nAnd when you end up with that\nprogram that is now checked,\n\n577\n00:34:25.784 --> 00:34:28.400\nthat loads up at the boot time.\n\n578\n00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.410\nThen you know that that is the program\nthat is causing you an issue.\n\n579\n00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:35.850\nSo you can use all these tools in\nconjunction to help you to troubleshoot\n\n580\n00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.082\nWindows 7.\n\n581\n00:34:37.082 --> 00:34:40.890\nVery effectively,\nif you will take the time to try and\n\n582\n00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:43.100\nlearn them a little bit on your own.\n\n583\n00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.000\nSo in other words, don't just watch this,\n\n584\n00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.020\nI know everything that there is\nto know about troubleshooting.\n\n585\n00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.580\nBut you've gotta take these skills that\nwe've talked about and apply them.\n\n586\n00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.970\nAnd that's really the key and\n\n587\n00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:55.510\nthe more often you do it, the better\nyou will become at troubleshooting.\n\n588\n00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.780\nAll right, Doctor Tonny, any last words\nbefore we close out of this episode.\n\n589\n00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.070\n>> I think I would just\nmention two more things.\n\n590\n00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:06.443\nSometimes you can try even to press\nthat Control + Alt + Delete and\n\n591\n00:35:06.443 --> 00:35:11.225\nyou try to go that application that\nenables you to see that performance.\n\n592\n00:35:11.225 --> 00:35:14.990\nAnd for example, is probably not even\nresponding and you're wondering.\n\n593\n00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:19.380\nSo sometimes restarting\nthe computer happens to be a very\n\n594\n00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:24.320\nuseful mechanism of restoring and\ntroubleshooting your computer.\n\n595\n00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.070\nSo you would just press the start\nbutton for a few seconds and\n\n596\n00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.980\nthen you will automatically go off.\n\n597\n00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.380\nAnd then you'll press it again and\nthen you'll come back and\n\n598\n00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.080\nthen the operating system and\nthe system software\n\n599\n00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.260\nwill just kind of reorganize itself again\nand then a computer starts to function.\n\n600\n00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.430\nThe other thing that I think is important\nto know is that there is a help function.\n\n601\n00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:51.220\nSo every time since you have a problem and\nyou really don't understand what to do,\n\n602\n00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.420\nthis episode of course has\ngiven you some insights.\n\n603\n00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.400\nYou can read, follow if you want.\n\n604\n00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.380\nBut right there, if you don't have\nan opportunity to find a book or\n\n605\n00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.410\nanything like that, you can press\nthe F1 button and then there you go.\n\n606\n00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.880\nIt gives you help function and\nthen you can read and\n\n607\n00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.160\nthen you can figure out what you\ncan possibly do in that context.\n\n608\n00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.990\nSo with that kind of information, we\nwanna believe that somehow you empowered\n\n609\n00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:18.120\na little bit to troubleshoot your\ncomputer when it has a problem.\n\n610\n00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.210\nThat if you're not able to fix it and\n\n611\n00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.750\nyou have a technician anywhere nearby,\nyou can reach out to them.\n\n612\n00:36:25.768 --> 00:36:27.620\nTry to be the network of one or\n\n613\n00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:32.450\ntwo persons you can call and\nyou can get your problem solved.\n\n614\n00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:36.141\nBut do remember that the computer\nalso has a lifetime,\n\n615\n00:36:36.141 --> 00:36:41.680\nit's not a permanent device that never\ngets old [LAUGH] at some point in time.\n\n616\n00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.530\nIt will have served this purpose and then\nyou probably have to make a replacement.\n\n617\n00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.160\nBuy a new one because sometimes as it gets\na little older, you try to troubleshoot,\n\n618\n00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.613\nit seems to be taking\nback to where you are.\n\n619\n00:36:53.613 --> 00:36:58.080\nAnd then now you're studying should spend\na bit too much time and effort on it.\n\n620\n00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.570\nAnd even when you try to upgrade it, it's\nnow starting to cost you a little more.\n\n621\n00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.910\nSo there's a point in time,\nbecause it depreciates over time,\n\n622\n00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:09.326\nit's an electronic device and you will\nreplace, so I do hope that this is useful.\n\n623\n00:37:09.326 --> 00:37:13.999\n>> All right, Dr. Tonny, thank you again\nfor helping us in understanding more about\n\n624\n00:37:13.999 --> 00:37:17.150\nthe administration and\nthe maintenance of Windows 7.\n\n625\n00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.410\nAnd it's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n626\n00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:23.820\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n627\n00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:29.070\n>> And my name is Dr. Tonny Omwanza,\nenjoy learning together on Windows 7.\n\n628\n00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.194\n>> All right, thank you and\nthank you for watching and\n\n629\n00:37:32.194 -->

00:00:19.660\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and you're\nwatching the computer fundamentals IC3\n\n4\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.370\nshow where we're taking a look now into\nthe realm of business productivity suites.\n\n5\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.800\nMore specifically, gonna be talking\nabout Microsoft Office itself, 2010.\n\n6\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.440\nMaking sure that we understand some\nof the different concepts there.\n\n7\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.968\nAnd who better to help us than Dr.\nTonny Omwansa today?\n\n8\n00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.824\nSo Dr. Tonny, welcome back to our studios.\n\n9\n00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:39.330\n>> Thank you very much for having me.\n\n10\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.740\nIt's always good being here and\nusing this as a forum to learn and\n\n11\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.750\nexchange knowledge, so\nwe get better in improving our services,\n\n12\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.740\nour work environment and the like.\n\n13\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.520\nSo today, if you have been with us,\nnow we are zooming in to\n\n14\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.930\nsome very specific things,\ngetting into more technical details.\n\n15\n00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.650\nIf you haven't watched the previous shows,\nmaybe you may want to go and\n\n16\n00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.880\nspend a little bit of time there, bring\nyourself up to speed, before we zoom in.\n\n17\n00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.300\n>> Okay, so when we start talking about\nthe idea of using Microsoft Office and\n\n18\n00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.340\nsticking with this one productivity suite,\nsome of the things that we're gonna end up\n\n19\n00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.340\nseeing is that it actually really helps us\nout when we choose one particular suite.\n\n20\n00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.695\nMicrosoft Office is one of the most\npopular ones out there, and Dr.\n\n21\n00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:25.300\nTonny is actually gonna show us why.\n\n22\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.430\nAnd when we start taking we've got\nsome of the different products,\n\n23\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.910\nwe're gonna see some very\nfamiliar interfaces to them.\n\n24\n00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.772\nAnd we're actually gonna see why\nit's actually worth our time\n\n25\n00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:37.012\nin getting used to learning about\nthis one particular product as well.\n\n26\n00:01:37.012 --> 00:01:39.490\nSo Dr. Tonny,\nwhat are we gonna start off with?\n\n27\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.250\n>> All right great,\n\n28\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.850\nas we spoke last time, this suite\nentails several specific products.\n\n29\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.720\nWe've got Microsoft Word,\nwe've got Microsoft Excel,\n\n30\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.310\nwe've got Microsoft Access,\nand Microsoft PowerPoint.\n\n31\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.130\nAnd if you looked at it last time,\nthere's something common about them,\n\n32\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.600\nthat some elements are generic about them.\n\n33\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.738\nSo, we're gonna spend some time in this\nparticular show to think about what\n\n34\n00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:06.137\nare some of the generic things that once\nwe've learnt them we just now continue to\n\n35\n00:02:06.137 --> 00:02:10.033\nuse them irrespective of which\nproduct we're gonna spend our time on.\n\n36\n00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:11.049\n[COUGH].\n\n37\n00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.149\nSo we're going to start identifying\nsome of the basic parts\n\n38\n00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.855\nof Microsoft application interface.\n\n39\n00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:24.205\nWe'll think about the common features\nof all the Office applications.\n\n40\n00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:28.165\nWe'll think about how do you open,\nhow do you save, how do you create files,\n\n41\n00:02:28.165 --> 00:02:30.425\nhow do you name files and the like.\n\n42\n00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:32.903\nAnd then we'll think about maybe\nyou want to email something or\n\n43\n00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:34.560\nyou want to print something.\n\n44\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.110\nAnd finally, how do you adjust certain\nelements of a specific application?\n\n45\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.000\nThat's what we're, we'll see how\nfar we'll go hopefully we finish.\n\n46\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.200\n>> There's no doubt that a lot of\ntimes what ends up happening is you\n\n47\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.330\nchoose let's say different products for\neach thing that you want to do,\n\n48\n00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.590\nyou end up having actually relearn\na product again because the environment or\n\n49\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.180\nthe interface is so different.\n\n50\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.130\nWhat we're about to see here is by\nchoosing this one entire suite which\n\n51\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.690\nencompasses all those products that we've\ntalked about in our previous episode,\n\n52\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.020\nMicrosoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and\n\n53\n00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.920\nAccess, that there are a lot\nof commonalities there.\n\n54\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.230\nAnd what that actually mean for\nus is that the knowledge transfers over.\n\n55\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.020\nIf you actually learn about one\nproduct where certain things are,\n\n56\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.040\nyou'll actually be able to\ncarry that over to other ones.\n\n57\n00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.276\nSo what are we gonna see first Dr. Tonny?\n\n58\n00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:23.320\n>> Okay, great.\n\n59\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.246\nThe one thing I like about computing is\nthat it borrows a lot from real life.\n\n60\n00:03:27.246 --> 00:03:30.980\nWhen we say memory, so\nwe talk about memory in a computer,\n\n61\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.760\nbut that's also how we memorize.\n\n62\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.950\nWe think about a dialogue box, or we think\nabout a tab, or we think about storage.\n\n63\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.840\nThat's what we do,\nthat's how we process things.\n\n64\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.550\nSo, we're gonna learn a few terminologies\nand we're gonna demonstrate that\n\n65\n00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.070\nphysically here, on the computer,\nso that you appreciate.\n\n66\n00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.290\nSo a great place to start is\nlet's open Microsoft Word.\n\n67\n00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.900\nSo there I am,\nI'm opening Microsoft Word as I did before\n\n68\n00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.740\non to the programs,\non to Microsoft Office, and there I am.\n\n69\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.130\nMicrosoft Word 2010.\n\n70\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.860\nNow right before I go into this, you\nwill notice, even if I opened Excel and\n\n71\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.650\nAccess, particularly Access, you'll\nsee certain elements that are similar.\n\n72\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.560\nSo, and that's fine.\n\n73\n00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.090\nThat's why we're here.\n\n74\n00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.140\nSo to start off, I think one thing\nthat we need to appreciate is that\n\n75\n00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.900\nyou can see tabs appear.\n\n76\n00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.370\nYou can see things organized\nin certain groups.\n\n77\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.960\nIt's important to appreciate\nwhat each of these is about.\n\n78\n00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.300\nEarlier versions of Microsoft Word\nwere a little different.\n\n79\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.690\nThis is a way of grouping things so\n\n80\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.500\nthat things that are related are grouped\ntogether and you can easily add things.\n\n81\n00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.060\nYou can configure this to add things.\n\n82\n00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.120\nSo let's start off with a first step for\nexample.\n\n83\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.940\nThis is telling me about how to\nmanipulate text that I already have put.\n\n84\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.600\nSo assuming I had a word here, word.\n\n85\n00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.350\nI would try to increase that font.\n\n86\n00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.757\nNow don't worry exactly how\nI'm doing it for now, but\n\n87\n00:05:04.757 --> 00:05:06.810\nI'm going to simply\nillustrate a few things.\n\n88\n00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.220\nSo I can click this and I can select it.\n\n89\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.610\nI now have selected this word, and\ntherefore I can do something with it.\n\n90\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.290\nI can make it bold,\nI can change the color.\n\n91\n00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.840\nI can underline it,\ndon't worry exactly how I'm doing it but\n\n92\n00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.010\nthe point is that it's doable.\n\n93\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.850\nI can increase the font size,\nI can make it italicized.\n\n94\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.930\nNow what I'm doing here?\n\n95\n00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.270\nI'm manipulating text in this section.\n\n96\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.660\nSo to just give you a little more\ninsight into that, we can group things.\n\n97\n00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.490\nSo what I've done here is that I've taken\na section to explain is that look, there's\n\n98\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.870\nsomething called a group which basically\nis a named section of a ribbon tab.\n\n99\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.800\nSo each of these sections\ncan be considered as one.\n\n100\n00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.330\nWe've grouped it, we've got to Insert.\n\n101\n00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.610\nIf you go to Page Layout,\nyou can see a line here and a line here.\n\n102\n00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.770\nThis is some kind of a group and\nit is named down here, so\n\n103\n00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.970\nthis is a page setup group, or\na background group or paragraph group.\n\n104\n00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.200\nOr theme group.\n\n105\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.670\nIf I go back home we've got\nsomething about paragraph,\n\n106\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.240\nwe've got something about font.\n\n107\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.910\nIf I go to review we've got\nsomething about tracking,\n\n108\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.500\nwe've got something about changing.\n\n109\n00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.280\nSo, things are organized in groups so that\nthings that are related just like we spoke\n\n110\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.432\nabout Access earlier on, the things that\nare related tends to be grouped together.\n\n111\n00:06:29.432 --> 00:06:34.070\nSo that's one important thing in thinking\nabout the interface of Microsoft Office\n\n112\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.937\nand that kind of applies in a number\nof these other application softwares.\n\n113\n00:06:38.937 --> 00:06:40.415\n>> All right.\n\n114\n00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:44.505\nSo, when we start seeing this idea of\nthese different types of things that he\n\n115\n00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:48.205\nshowed us on the home tab, what we're\nseeing is that they're also sub-divided\n\n116\n00:06:48.205 --> 00:06:51.295\nup into those different groupings to\nallow us to get the functionality.\n\n117\n00:06:51.295 --> 00:06:54.575\nAnd underneath each one of those groups\nis, normally, the name of that group.\n\n118\n00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:57.255\nAnd that really helps you\nout when you're looking for\n\n119\n00:06:57.255 --> 00:07:00.405\na particular functionality,\nto be able to go, and go, all right,\n\n120\n00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:04.010\nunderneath this particular group for\nediting, or for cut, copy and\n\n121\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.680\npaste you'll actually see that they\nnormally show little icons that would\n\n122\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.780\nshow you images that actually do\nrelate to what is going to be.\n\n123\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.695\nThe other thing that we also will\nend up seeing is that throughout\n\n124\n00:07:15.695 --> 00:07:19.475\nwhatever program, even though\nDr Tonny showed us this in Word,\n\n125\n00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:23.925\nthat if you open up Excel,\nyou'll get the same familiarity.\n\n126\n00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:26.255\nSi if you're just used to\nworking in Word and you go,\n\n127\n00:07:26.255 --> 00:07:28.485\nI've never worked in Excel before.\n\n128\n00:07:28.485 --> 00:07:31.131\nOnce you open it up and\nyou'll see that same idea,\n\n129\n00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:34.974\nyou'll actually see that working\ninside of each one of those programs,\n\n130\n00:07:34.974 --> 00:07:37.431\neven though they will\nactually be different,\n\n131\n00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:41.778\na lot of the processes that you and I will\nuse between them will feel very familiar,\n\n132\n00:07:41.778 --> 00:07:44.313\nand even intuitive at\ntimes to help us out here.\n\n133\n00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:46.420\nNow, when we start seeing that, right?\n\n134\n00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.495\nIt helps us here.\n\n135\n00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:50.367\nBecause what we're gonna go over later on,\nright, is that Dr.\n\n136\n00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:53.201\nTonny is gonna lead us through\neach one of these applications.\n\n137\n00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.929\nAnd what we're establishing now is\nthe terminology that he'll be using So\n\n138\n00:07:56.929 --> 00:08:00.537\nthat way you can follow along on your\nown with these programs as well, and\n\n139\n00:08:00.537 --> 00:08:03.794\nunderstand exactly where he's\nactually going to be clicking and\n\n140\n00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:08.010\nwhat he's gonna be showing us, and\nhow to do the things that we need to do.\n\n141\n00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.930\nBut becoming familiar with that\ninterface is pretty much the key,\n\n142\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.630\nwhen you start taking look at something\nlike the groups and the tabs.\n\n143\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.720\nNow, the top part of that screen that\nwe are seeing on Dr Tony's computer.\n\n144\n00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.780\nThat is also called the ribbon interface\ntoo and that is because it has a ribbon of\n\n145\n00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.450\nthose different icons and text across the\ntop and it doesn't cover any of the area\n\n146\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.280\nthat we saw on the word processing itself,\nand you'll see that.\n\n147\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.090\nNothing, actually,\nkinda pulls down and drops down\n\n148\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.610\nover the area that you're working in,\nbut, actually, slides as a ribbon.\n\n149\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.282\nYou click on another tab above that\nto the right, you actually see that.\n\n150\n00:08:44.282 --> 00:08:47.380\nIt will just switch, and so you'll\nactually see different elements, but\n\n151\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.530\nnone of it ever covers the area\nthat you're actually working in\n\n152\n00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.720\nat that particular point in time.\n\n153\n00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.733\nSo when you start seeing those types\nof element you again are gonna see them\n\n154\n00:08:56.733 --> 00:09:01.070\nacross multiple interfaces or multiple\napplications that we're gonna see and\n\n155\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.208\nhopefully you'll say all right, I know I\ncan work in that cuz I did it in Word I\n\n156\n00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:09.350\nknow it gonna work the same in Excel,\nand probably the same in PowerPoint and\n\n157\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.644\neven the same in Access\na lot of the times.\n\n158\n00:09:11.644 --> 00:09:14.829\n>> Great, now after spending some\ntime think about the ribbon,\n\n159\n00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:16.625\nlet's go to the base of that page.\n\n160\n00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:20.990\nThe base of that page is a status bar, so\n\n161\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.310\nit gives us a sense of\nthe status of the document.\n\n162\n00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:30.250\nSo let's look at my example here, so\nif I copy this word and I put four of them\n\n163\n00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.980\nat the base somewhere here, at the status\nbar, you can see that I have four words.\n\n164\n00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.630\nNow, of course,\nif I reduce they're becoming three,\n\n165\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.190\nif I increase the number of pages,\nthe number of pages now have become two,\n\n166\n00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:49.323\nso if I come to the right and\nI try to reduce the,\n\n167\n00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:54.670\nI zoom in, I zoom in, I zoom in now it\ntells me that I actually have two pages.\n\n168\n00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.490\nSo, the status bar gives you\nan opportunity to think about\n\n169\n00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.620\nhow does the whole document\ngenerally look like.\n\n170\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.170\nIf I want to do some counting of words,\nif I select some words and\n\n171\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.610\nI want to know, how many are they,\nhow many characters are there.\n\n172\n00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.390\nSo, it gives you a sense\nof the document itself.\n\n173\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.140\nAll right, so at the top,\nonce we've opened the document.\n\n174\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.100\nSo let's say I want to\nmanipulate this document,\n\n175\n00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.820\nthere are a number of\nthings I could do with it.\n\n176\n00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:32.220\nAnd the typical, Microsoft document\nthere's always an opportunity\n\n177\n00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.480\nto minimize it, an opportunity to maximize\nit, and an opportunity to close it.\n\n178\n00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.290\nSo, let's look at the top\nright corner of this window.\n\n179\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.420\nSo, at the top right corner, the last,\nand it's almost, most of the time, red,\n\n180\n00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.580\nand, I think, because he wanted to tell\nyou, ho, are you sure you want to do that?\n\n181\n00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.720\nSo, it is an x over there,\nyou can see an x.\n\n182\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.040\nThe x is for closing that document so\nif I click it, it will always ask me.\n\n183\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.490\nTurns like a prompt and tells me do\nyou want to save that document or\n\n184\n00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.860\nyou don't want to save or\nyou want to cancel.\n\n185\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.820\nSaving means, it is going to retain the\ncontent that you've already worked on and\n\n186\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.990\nwe will give it a name so\n\n187\n00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.130\nthat every time you want to come\nback to it you can always open it.\n\n188\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.830\nDon't save simply means, it means you're\ngonna lose everything you've been working\n\n189\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.430\non, if at all you are working on anything,\nso\n\n190\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.870\nit's not going to save that document,\nnone of the content.\n\n191\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.670\nCancel means let's go back\nto exactly where we are, so\n\n192\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.150\ndon't do anything, right there.\n\n193\n00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.830\nThat's the first button on extreme right.\n\n194\n00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.420\nNext is restore.\n\n195\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.390\nIt means well, take it back to the exact\nposition it was in the previous so\n\n196\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.910\nif I have moved this document\nto some point in time and\n\n197\n00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.590\nthen I maximize it, I have an opportunity\nto return it to the way it was.\n\n198\n00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.103\nIf let's say I was working on\nfour documents at the same time.\n\n199\n00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:46.600\nSo maybe this was on\nthe left top right corner.\n\n200\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.500\nAnd then I say, I've maximized it and\nthen I go back to that, I have resized it.\n\n201\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.232\nIt goes back to exactly\nthe way it was physically.\n\n202\n00:11:55.232 --> 00:11:57.917\nAnd then the last one,\nwhich is one of those three, is minimize.\n\n203\n00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:01.399\nIt means bring it right to the bottom\nhere, so I wouldn't see it, but\n\n204\n00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:05.301\nat least I can see some kind of a short\ncut, something that tells me, ah-ha,\n\n205\n00:12:05.301 --> 00:12:07.847\nif I want to go back to it,\nI can always point at it.\n\n206\n00:12:07.847 --> 00:12:12.134\nSo for now, it is minimized and\nI can always restore that one and pick,\n\n207\n00:12:12.134 --> 00:12:16.784\nif I have several documents at the same\ntime, so now I go back to my document,\n\n208\n00:12:16.784 --> 00:12:20.100\nit goes to the resized position and\nI can maximize it.\n\n209\n00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.800\nSo there you're playing around with\na particular document that you've\n\n210\n00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.030\nalready opened.\n\n211\n00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.512\nYou have an opportunity to\nlook at the status bar.\n\n212\n00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:30.221\nAnd you can close it, you can resize it,\nand you can minimize it.\n\n213\n00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:32.290\nHow is that Ronald?\n\n214\n00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.408\n>> Yeah, that's a great part of the actual\ncontrol of the application that we're\n\n215\n00:12:36.408 --> 00:12:37.338\ntaking a look at.\n\n216\n00:12:37.338 --> 00:12:41.020\nBy using the Close, we can close\nout of that entire application for\n\n217\n00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.672\nthe instance that we've\nactually got it open.\n\n218\n00:12:43.672 --> 00:12:45.157\nIf you see at the top of that bar,\n\n219\n00:12:45.157 --> 00:12:48.080\nit normally tells you the name of\nthe program and the file name.\n\n220\n00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.483\nAnd so using those three buttons gives you\nthat ability of course to be able then\n\n221\n00:12:52.483 --> 00:12:55.770\nto control that one window\nin that application.\n\n222\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.440\nBy closing it out, you're actually\ntelling it, hey go ahead and\n\n223\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.110\nmake sure that everything is actually off,\nthe Microsoft Word is turned off.\n\n224\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.510\nIf I chose not to save it like what Dr.\nTony said then it just disappears.\n\n225\n00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.808\nIf I choose to save it,\nI can later on come back and\n\n226\n00:13:09.808 --> 00:13:12.962\ntell it to open that document and\nactually have it reappear again.\n\n227\n00:13:12.962 --> 00:13:17.739\nBut the idea of restore down is very\nimportant or restore is actually very\n\n228\n00:13:17.739 --> 00:13:22.537\nimportant as well, because either it\nallows us to put in that position.\n\n229\n00:13:22.537 --> 00:13:26.617\nAnd then that way if I have multiple\nwindows open I can know that I can go to\n\n230\n00:13:26.617 --> 00:13:30.901\nthat particular, level and go all right,\nright there, then select it and\n\n231\n00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:31.990\nrestore it again.\n\n232\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.520\nIt gives us that ability to have memory\nto where our windows are going to be.\n\n233\n00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.980\nSo the control of the Windows actually\nvery important when you work with multiple\n\n234\n00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.230\nwindows because it\nreally does help you out\n\n235\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.950\nespecially when you name those documents.\n\n236\n00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.620\nA lot of times documents that you and\n\n237\n00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.100\nI may use especially word processing\ndocuments, they will look all the same.\n\n238\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.840\nAnd so what you wanna do\nis you wanna pay attention\n\n239\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.190\nto the naming of whatever\nthat document is.\n\n240\n00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.580\nAnd then you can control that entire\napplication that document's opening up\n\n241\n00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:07.010\nwith by using those top three buttons\non the upper right hand corner as well.\n\n242\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.395\nSo there's a lot more to this\ninterface though, isn't there?\n\n243\n00:14:09.395 --> 00:14:10.970\n>> Absolutely, a lot.\n\n244\n00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.210\nAnd I think we can talk the whole\nday about each of these things.\n\n245\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.990\nBut we are basically picking out\nsome of the things that we think\n\n246\n00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.768\nyou need in order to get started.\n\n247\n00:14:18.768 --> 00:14:23.750\nNow, as Ronald just indicated you can have\nmany documents opened in Microsoft Word\n\n248\n00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.480\nas you saw when I pointed down\nhere I actually was able to\n\n249\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.860\nlift up three documents that\nI'm currently working on.\n\n250\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.830\nOne is called document one,\nanother one is document two,\n\n251\n00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.690\nanother one is document three and\nI can rename them so\n\n252\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.850\nthat they have a name that I can\nrelate with and that's a good habit.\n\n253\n00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.090\nWe'll talk about that\nat some point in time.\n\n254\n00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.691\nAbout naming of documents so\n\n255\n00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:46.785\nthat they have a name that\nyou can easily relate with.\n\n256\n00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:49.510\nBecause you can build\na lot of documents and\n\n257\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.060\nyou can easily get confused about them.\n\n258\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:56.640\nBut, one thing is interesting, Ronald,\nthat anytime you have forgotten something,\n\n259\n00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.570\nyou can, absolutely, remind yourself.\n\n260\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.646\nI really like computers because of that.\n\n261\n00:15:00.646 --> 00:15:04.197\nLook, I can go to school, and try to learn\nas much as, and memorize as much, but,\n\n262\n00:15:04.197 --> 00:15:07.699\nmaybe, because I didn't use the computer\nfor a long time, I've, therefore,\n\n263\n00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:09.330\nforgotten something.\n\n264\n00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.790\nSo, anytime you have a problem,\nwhen you're working on any application,\n\n265\n00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.830\nthere's always an opportunity to get help.\n\n266\n00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.870\nThat means, be reminded, or study a little\nmore about something, in order to do it.\n\n267\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.130\nThat's the beauty about applications,\nsuch as, the Microsoft Word,\n\n268\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.200\nyou don't have to know everything up\nfront before you begin to use it.\n\n269\n00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.190\nSo, let's say I want to get some help,\nwhat I would do is,\n\n270\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.600\nthat I click, File and\nI get a menu option called Help.\n\n271\n00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.770\nI could have done it in another way,\n\n272\n00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:42.610\nif I was here I could have\njust clicked F1, F1 is common.\n\n273\n00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.069\nIt's really used for\npurposes of getting help.\n\n274\n00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:49.734\nSo let's go File > Help and\nwhat basically is going to\n\n275\n00:15:49.734 --> 00:15:54.929\nhappen is it will load the menu for\nHelp Like a page for help.\n\n276\n00:15:54.929 --> 00:15:58.370\nIt's like almost like a browser and\nthen from here I can type.\n\n277\n00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.700\nSo let's say I want to learn\nsomething about printing.\n\n278\n00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.860\nSo if I click Print, searching options\nthen it gives me a lot of options.\n\n279\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:06.470\nWhat did you want?\n\n280\n00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.390\nYou wanted to print and\npreview something in Microsoft or\n\n281\n00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.980\nyou wanted to create and\nprint a single envelope, whatever.\n\n282\n00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.590\nAnywhere there is something to do with\nHelp it will give you some information.\n\n283\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.630\nAnd the beautiful thing about\nthe Help function is that\n\n284\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.650\nyou can print that particular page so\n\n285\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.650\nthat maybe you can save it somewhere or\nyou can scribble something.\n\n286\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.990\nYou can increase the font above the Help.\n\n287\n00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.190\nYou can explore.\n\n288\n00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.060\nSo the beautiful thing in\nthose terms there's so\n\n289\n00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.900\nmuch information within the Help function\nthat if you studied slowly but surely, you\n\n290\n00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.830\nclick, you can search, you can explore,\nyou can print, you can re-write it, etc.\n\n291\n00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.600\nSo there's a lot of stuff you\ncan do within the help which\n\n292\n00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.340\nthen helps you to revise,\nlearn more, and get better.\n\n293\n00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.512\nI don't know, Ronnie, whether you've\nused the Help function at some point.\n\n294\n00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.464\nYou look like someone who's\njust knows everything.\n\n295\n00:16:54.464 --> 00:16:57.894\n>> [LAUGH] No, I don't know everything but\nthe Help function,\n\n296\n00:16:57.894 --> 00:17:01.472\nit is a great resource for\nyou especially when you're stuck.\n\n297\n00:17:01.472 --> 00:17:04.692\nAnd even if you have been working\nin the Office products for\n\n298\n00:17:04.692 --> 00:17:08.350\na long time there are things\nthat you just don't remember.\n\n299\n00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.720\nAnd so even though I might remember the\nmajority of it there are times when I go,\n\n300\n00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.980\nI just don't remember\nexactly how to do that.\n\n301\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.520\nPressing just the F1 key right away\nbrings up that Help menu that allows me\n\n302\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.790\nnow not only to search a help database\nthat may be on my computer, but\n\n303\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.590\nnow the way that Microsoft Office has\nit is that if you are connected to\n\n304\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:32.800\nthe the Internet, it'll go out and search\nthe database on Microsoft Office itself.\n\n305\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.530\nSo in other words, that database is\nthe one that's actually live and updated,\n\n306\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.560\ninstead of just a simple help database\nthat was on your computer that might have\n\n307\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.800\nactually been installed on there when\nyou first installed the software.\n\n308\n00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.020\nSo it does give you updated\nfunctionality for using that help and\n\n309\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:53.150\nit is a recommended tool because\nyou do tend to get a lot of very,\n\n310\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.870\nvery directed, helpful information.\n\n311\n00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.310\nIf you happen to just not remember\nsomething or if you don't know how to do\n\n312\n00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:04.820\nsomething, a very neat way,\na very succinct, step-by-step way\n\n313\n00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.410\nthat will help you to learn a lot more\nabout whatever product that you're in.\n\n314\n00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:13.275\nAnd the neat feature about this, right, is\nthat it's actually just about in the same\n\n315\n00:18:13.275 --> 00:18:17.748\nlocation through every single product\ninside of Microsoft Office 2010.\n\n316\n00:18:17.748 --> 00:18:22.252\n>> Great, Ronnie, what you just mentioned\nis something that my professor taught me\n\n317\n00:18:22.252 --> 00:18:24.702\ncalled context sensitive help, right?\n\n318\n00:18:24.702 --> 00:18:27.385\nThat means it's exactly where you are,\n\n319\n00:18:27.385 --> 00:18:31.485\nyou can learn exactly about that\nparticular issue by pressing F1.\n\n320\n00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:37.185\nIf I was on the opening file or\nwas trying to print something and I can't\n\n321\n00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:41.515\nremember exactly what I need to do, if I\npress F1 at that particular point it will\n\n322\n00:18:41.515 --> 00:18:45.005\ngive me information about the printing or\nabout the opening of the file etc.\n\n323\n00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:49.702\nSo let's spend a little bit of moments\nto think about how do you move around\n\n324\n00:18:49.702 --> 00:18:51.285\nwhen you're at Microsoft Word.\n\n325\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.630\nIf right now, if you open the Microsoft\nWord, and I've just opened mine, and\n\n326\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.950\nI go to a tab called View.\n\n327\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.130\nSo under View,\nI have a very interesting thing here.\n\n328\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.220\nIf I click Zoom, it can give me\nan opportunity to zoom things.\n\n329\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.165\nI can zoom in terms of percentage.\n\n330\n00:19:14.165 --> 00:19:18.650\nI can zoom in terms of, I can select very\nspecific or any predefined percentages.\n\n331\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.811\nI can look at this document as 100%.\n\n332\n00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:28.150\nI can look at this document in terms of\none page at a time, two pages at a time.\n\n333\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.000\nAnd possibly the width\nof that whole document.\n\n334\n00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.840\nSo, if I had more than one page, so\n\n335\n00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.620\nlet me just enter Tab until\nI open the second page.\n\n336\n00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.395\nNow, you can see I'm viewing\nfour pages at a time.\n\n337\n00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:41.770\nSo when I do two pages at a time,\n\n338\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.630\nit means on that particular\nscreen it's showing me two pages.\n\n339\n00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.414\nIf I do one page,\nit means I'm only able to see one page.\n\n340\n00:19:48.414 --> 00:19:52.910\nAnd when I come down here, zooming gives\nme an opportunity to view several at a go.\n\n341\n00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:58.940\nI can zoom and see only one at a goal,\nsee I can play around with that document.\n\n342\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.140\nNow as I was moving around,\nthere is some mechanism for\n\n343\n00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.893\nscrolling, we call it scroll bar.\n\n344\n00:20:05.893 --> 00:20:09.870\nHey, I always like the scroll bar because\nif I was walking with a document like\n\n345\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:14.560\nthis, and I want to go to the top of the\ndocument or to the bottom of the document,\n\n346\n00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.460\nif I was opening a book,\nI have to move the book back and forth.\n\n347\n00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.590\nThe beautiful thing about scrolling is\nthat I can move very quickly to the top.\n\n348\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.680\nNow over here I have four pages.\n\n349\n00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.248\nSo assuming this was page one.\n\n350\n00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:33.602\nAnd at the end, if I go to the end,\nI don't worry how I do it, but\n\n351\n00:20:33.602 --> 00:20:35.290\nat least I'm on page four now.\n\n352\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:42.240\nSo if I want to move from page four to\npage one, I can just scroll up, boom, and\n\n353\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.400\nthere I am at page one, all right?\n\n354\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.350\nAnd then I can type stuff here.\n\n355\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.590\nI remembered something I need to see\nin page three, I can scroll down.\n\n356\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.890\nAnd there are several ways of scrolling.\n\n357\n00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:57.610\nI could take this arrow up here and scroll\nup and then come down and scroll down.\n\n358\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.040\nThis gives you an opportunity\nto scroll slowly.\n\n359\n00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.021\nBut if I wanna move quickly,\nI can just hold onto this and\n\n360\n00:21:04.021 --> 00:21:06.930\nthen I scroll very quickly up and down.\n\n361\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.860\nSo this way I'm able to move\nin a document very quickly.\n\n362\n00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.560\nAnd by zooming, then I get a chance\nas to what do I want to focus?\n\n363\n00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.720\nDo I want to look at\nthe entire document at a go?\n\n364\n00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:21.440\nIf I have 30 pages, I can very easily zoom\nthis and I can see numerous pages at a go.\n\n365\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.838\nOr I can just see one page\nat a go to the very end.\n\n366\n00:21:24.838 --> 00:21:27.420\nDo you find that useful in working,\nRonnie?\n\n367\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.310\n>> I definitely do, and\nthe reason why is because of my eyesight\n\n368\n00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.740\nmore than anything else\nas far as the zoom goes.\n\n369\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.190\nIt really helps me in my eyesight.\n\n370\n00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:38.490\nWhenever I start to think that I\nthink I see everything clearly and\n\n371\n00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:43.470\nI'm not sure, especially when I have\nlittle marks, like the period at times or\n\n372\n00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.650\nstuff, and when I set a default\nfont of 12, I still can't see that.\n\n373\n00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:53.250\nZoom really helps me to be able to make\nsure that I do have it printed correctly.\n\n374\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.140\nSometimes I might print out a doc and\nI might see things that I don't\n\n375\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.310\nexpect to see and it's just because\nof my eyesight and then I zoom in and\n\n376\n00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.300\nI can see if I've added in\nextra characters, if I haven't.\n\n377\n00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.360\nThat zoom function and\n\n378\n00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.750\nbeing able to navigate quickly\nthrough large documents is a key.\n\n379\n00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.830\nMost of us, we can navigate\nthrough one page at the time.\n\n380\n00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.320\nBut if we have to do that,\nlet's say through 10 to 20 documents,\n\n381\n00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.130\nbeing able to get to that particular\npage the way that we want to as\n\n382\n00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.830\nquickly as we want, using the scroll\nbar as well as the zoom feature\n\n383\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:24.450\nmay help us to be able to find\nexactly what we need in place.\n\n384\n00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.910\nSo it's not all about small\ndocuments a lot of times,\n\n385\n00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.600\nwhich is what I tend to work with.\n\n386\n00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.850\nBut when you start working with\nreports that are 10, 20, 30,\n\n387\n00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:36.610\nhundreds of pages long, now all of a\nsudden if you happen to be writing a book,\n\n388\n00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.560\na novel of some sort or\na textbook you may actually find this\n\n389\n00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.900\nto be a more useful feature than if you're\nsimply just typing out one page at a time.\n\n390\n00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.720\nBut for me, that's all I do,\n\n391\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.680\nand that's better than trying\nto read my own handwriting.\n\n392\n00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.728\nSo using the zoom is actually one of\nthe most useful things that I tend to do.\n\n393\n00:22:54.728 --> 00:22:59.780\nNow, Dr. Tonny, you use that little slider\nin that lower right hand corner, and\n\n394\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.040\nthat is a very neat feature too because\nit gives you granularity, right.\n\n395\n00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.730\nI may not wanna see it at 150%,\nwhich is the default marking there,\n\n396\n00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.250\nI may want to see it at 125%.\n\n397\n00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.780\nWell, it gives me that ability to control\nhow big of that zoom I want it to be, and\n\n398\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.630\nso I can see it a little\nbit better as well.\n\n399\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.870\nSo you get very granular control or\n\n400\n00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.220\nyou can actually just have those\ndefaults there, if you use the ribbon\n\n401\n00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.220\non the top to actually select\nwhat zoom level that you want to.\n\n402\n00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.340\nSo very much, a very controlled\n\n403\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.950\nway to be able to see the information\nthat you have in front of you.\n\n404\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.395\n>> Wonderful,\nnow let me tell you something.\n\n405\n00:23:35.395 --> 00:23:38.503\nEvery time you work on a Word document or\ntext and\n\n406\n00:23:38.503 --> 00:23:42.777\nyou're playing around with\ndifferent things in that document,\n\n407\n00:23:42.777 --> 00:23:47.848\nchances are very high you're going to\ncopy something and take it somewhere.\n\n408\n00:23:47.848 --> 00:23:51.244\nYou wanna get it somewhere and\nbring into your document or vice versa.\n\n409\n00:23:51.244 --> 00:23:53.260\nChances are you're going\nto delete something.\n\n410\n00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.300\nChances are you're going to insert\nsomething somewhere within the document.\n\n411\n00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.710\nSo it becomes important for\nyou to understand how to select text and\n\n412\n00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.420\nthen manipulate that text so\nthat you can either cut it,\n\n413\n00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.760\nyou can copy it,\nyou can paste it somewhere.\n\n414\n00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.400\nThose are words that we use, but gradually\nthey'll become clear what exactly we mean.\n\n415\n00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.730\nSo let's assume I got a document\nhere that I'm calling Page1.\n\n416\n00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.520\nNevermind, it's just a name, all right?\n\n417\n00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.720\nSo lets say, I want to underline that text\n\n418\n00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.960\nbecause sometimes you want to\nput a little emphasis on a word.\n\n419\n00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.450\nSo if I click at the beginning\nof that document,\n\n420\n00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:33.310\nholding my left button of the mouse,\ndepending what kind of mouse you're using.\n\n421\n00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.972\nAnd then I drag to the right,\nit gives me an opportunity to select.\n\n422\n00:24:36.972 --> 00:24:41.159\nNow that once you've selected then\nyou can do many things with that\n\n423\n00:24:41.159 --> 00:24:43.110\nparticular part of a text.\n\n424\n00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:47.200\nYou can select the whole line, you can\nselect the whole paragraph, you can select\n\n425\n00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.360\nfew characters, you can select a word or\nyou can select a collection of word.\n\n426\n00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.700\nIt's all a question of\nwhere did you begin and\n\n427\n00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.750\nwhere did you end while\nholding the mouse down.\n\n428\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.280\nSo here I am, I want to do something.\n\n429\n00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.130\nDon't worry now how I do it but basically\nI'm going to make that underlined.\n\n430\n00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:05.760\nHow I did it?\n\n431\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.390\nIt's a detail,\n\n432\n00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:12.200\nwe'll get back to that at some point in\ntime, so I can go back to my text here.\n\n433\n00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.430\nI was using this book and then I thought,\n\n434\n00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.990\nI need to capture this text here and\ntake it to my document, so I clicked\n\n435\n00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:25.280\nat the beginning of using the office\nclipboard and then I dragged to the right.\n\n436\n00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.880\nDrag down, further down and I got here.\n\n437\n00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.785\nAt that point, I click CTRL+C.\n\n438\n00:25:33.785 --> 00:25:36.270\nCTRL+C gives me the opportunity to copy.\n\n439\n00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.080\nI am not deleting anything from there.\n\n440\n00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.920\nI am just simply copying it.\n\n441\n00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.550\nNow there is something really\npositive about copy, of course,\n\n442\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.485\nthere is something negative about copying,\nright?\n\n443\n00:25:44.485 --> 00:25:47.516\nBut let's do something\npositive about copy.\n\n444\n00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:53.930\nSo I click CTRL+C and then I go back to\nexactly where I was and I click Ctrl+V.\n\n445\n00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.760\nSo what that does it pastes\nexactly what I copied.\n\n446\n00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.920\nSo that means, in memory the computer\nwas holding the exact content that I\n\n447\n00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.500\ncut from a different place.\n\n448\n00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.060\nAnd I just do CTRL+V,\nit pastes it exactly.\n\n449\n00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.060\nNow the format may have been lost and\nthat's fine.\n\n450\n00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.020\nIn some cases the mechanics for managing\nthe format so that it remains the same but\n\n451\n00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.940\nfor now what we were able\nto do is copy and paste it.\n\n452\n00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.720\nSo now, with these text I can do a lot.\n\n453\n00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.690\nSo let's see this specific section\nthat I want to put emphasis.\n\n454\n00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.700\nSo I come at the beginning\nof the word Office, and\n\n455\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.470\nI then do the same thing as I said, copy,\nand I say, well look, I don't like that.\n\n456\n00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.790\nI want to change those two words and then\ncall them, I give them a Swahili name.\n\n457\n00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.490\nWhere I come from would\nspeak Swahili right?\n\n458\n00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.720\n>> Okay.\n>> I want to say Jambo.\n\n459\n00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.670\nSo I'm going to delete that CTRL+X.\n\n460\n00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.700\nIt means I am holding that text somewhere.\n\n461\n00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.820\nAnd then I come and type Jambo, okay?\n\n462\n00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.988\nNow of course that doesn't make\nany semantic sense for now.\n\n463\n00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:55.554\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n464\n00:26:55.554 --> 00:26:57.670\n[LAUGH] at least I've shown you something.\n\n465\n00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:02.350\nAnd then I move to the right after the\nword there, I create some space and say,\n\n466\n00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:07.040\nI want to put now that text that\nI extracted from that section and\n\n467\n00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.370\ncurrently holding it I say CTRL+V,\nthat is Paste.\n\n468\n00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:15.620\nSo I've gone through CTRL+X,\nCTRL+V and CTRL+C.\n\n469\n00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.110\nCopying, Pasting and Cutting.\n\n470\n00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.700\nNow those options also still exist,\nyou can do them menu.\n\n471\n00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.620\nI mean if you went through the menu\nyou can also do that but for\n\n472\n00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.600\nnow I was just going through shortcuts.\n\n473\n00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.950\nSo we appreciate how could you\npossibly do it, with your own text.\n\n474\n00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.780\nIf I want I can underline text,\n\n475\n00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:37.510\nI can select and bolder it,\nunderline and change the color.\n\n476\n00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:38.340\nSee?\n\n477\n00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.830\nSo over time as I do manual things I\ncan put the emphasis where I need too.\n\n478\n00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:43.860\nI can reorganize it.\n\n479\n00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.410\nI can move things around and\nthat, basically, is saying,\n\n480\n00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.820\nI am working on my Word document,\nand adding value to it.\n\n481\n00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.250\nDo you find this useful as well, Ronald?\n\n482\n00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.540\n>> Definitely, especially,\na lot of times when I'm actually having to\n\n483\n00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.300\ntype in information on my own,\nwhen I'm creating notes for a show, and\n\n484\n00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.900\nmay find that I have, actually,\nput things into the wrong order that I've\n\n485\n00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.620\ntyped them out And instead of me having\nto erase the entire document and\n\n486\n00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.460\nretype it all back into the proper order,\nI instead can select the text that I need\n\n487\n00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.030\nto go first, go ahead and\ncopy that into the Office clipboard.\n\n488\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.490\nAnd then put my cursor where\nI need it to be and then use\n\n489\n00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.040\nthat Paste function to actually reorder\nthings the way that I want to as well.\n\n490\n00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.302\nSo the nice thing about this idea, right,\nis that it not only works inside of Word.\n\n491\n00:28:30.302 --> 00:28:34.321\nDr. Tonney could have also taken that\ninformation, and he wouldn't because it\n\n492\n00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:37.881\nwouldn't make any sense,\nhe could have also taken that information.\n\n493\n00:28:37.881 --> 00:28:43.370\nEven now, he could open up Excel and\npaste that into a cell inside of Excel.\n\n494\n00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:47.986\nSo in other words, that clipboard that we\ntalked about that's saving it in memory,\n\n495\n00:28:47.986 --> 00:28:51.368\nthe way that he described it,\nit actually does save it there,\n\n496\n00:28:51.368 --> 00:28:55.750\nhe can open up another program and take\ninformation and also populate it there.\n\n497\n00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.630\nSo it allows us to be able to use that\nbetween those different products and\n\n498\n00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:03.600\nthat's what makes that Office productivity\nsuite, Microsoft Office 2010.\n\n499\n00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.270\nAlso another valuable feature as well\n\n500\n00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.130\nbecause we can actually use\nit in between those programs.\n\n501\n00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:13.310\nAnd even a lot of times even programs\noutside the Office Suite as well.\n\n502\n00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:17.420\nBut it really does help us out when\nwe have techs that we do need to move\n\n503\n00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:22.030\nfrom one particular location to\nanother within that same document or\n\n504\n00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.940\neven from one program to another as well.\n\n505\n00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.860\nThese particular combinations,\nespecially those shortcuts,\n\n506\n00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:32.250\nare then become secondary to you the more\nthat you work in Microsoft Office.\n\n507\n00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.280\nThat Copy, Cut and Paste,\n\n508\n00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.470\nthey are things that I do just about every\nsingle day when working with computers.\n\n509\n00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.770\n>> All right.\nLet's just sophisticated a little more.\n\n510\n00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.490\nLet's add.\n\n511\n00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:47.195\nWe already know those CTRL+C, CTRL+X,\nCTRL+V, Copy, Cut, you know, Paste.\n\n512\n00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:50.260\nLets just add a few more\nthings along the same line.\n\n513\n00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.160\nSo there is always the power\nof using shortcuts.\n\n514\n00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.010\nOf course for\n\n515\n00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:58.310\nall shortcuts that we are gonna talk about\nhere they already exists in menu form.\n\n516\n00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.290\nSo we'll get to that\nat some point in time.\n\n517\n00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:03.080\nBut we're just quickly trying\nto show the possibilities here.\n\n518\n00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.402\nSo let's say I'm at\nthe beginning of this document.\n\n519\n00:30:05.402 --> 00:30:10.670\nIt's Page1 and I just realized there ought\nto have been a space between page and 1.\n\n520\n00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.620\nSo I put my cursor right between e and\n1 and\n\n521\n00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.170\nthen I say well, I need put a space,\nI press the spacebar.\n\n522\n00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.550\nNow I've got a space and\nthen I put another one.\n\n523\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:29.250\nSo, two because I don't think I like it,\nI put four or I accidentally I put ten.\n\n524\n00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.550\nThen, no, no, no, no, no, that's not\nexactly how it was supposed to be.\n\n525\n00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.805\nThere was supposed to be only two.\n\n526\n00:30:33.805 --> 00:30:37.670\nSo I can say, CTRL+Z.\n\n527\n00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:41.785\nThere is a possibility of un-doing\nthings that we've already created, or\n\n528\n00:30:41.785 --> 00:30:43.090\nre-doing them.\n\n529\n00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:47.330\nSo we're gonna set CTRL+Z,\nand then I press Z,\n\n530\n00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:51.868\nIt reverses that particular action, so we\nsay it has taken back to a previous state.\n\n531\n00:30:51.868 --> 00:30:54.970\nNow let's say, on second thought,\n\n532\n00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.820\nI actually thinks that's exactly where I\nwanted to go so I didn't need to do it.\n\n533\n00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.990\nSo I will again click control Y,\n\n534\n00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:05.270\nit takes me to now my other\nstate that I actually wanted.\n\n535\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.612\nSo the possibly of doing and\nundoing exists.\n\n536\n00:31:08.612 --> 00:31:12.742\nSo every time you do something on\nthe computer, on Microsoft Word and you\n\n537\n00:31:12.742 --> 00:31:17.750\nrealize that's not what you wanted, there\nis always, it's like when we go to church,\n\n538\n00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:22.700\na friend of mine took me to church and\nhe told me your sins have been forgiven.\n\n539\n00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.790\nThat means God has erased.\n\n540\n00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.582\nAnd then that means you can\ngo to the previous state iii.\n\n541\n00:31:29.582 --> 00:31:31.714\nThat really sounds great.\n\n542\n00:31:31.714 --> 00:31:35.280\nSo you can to a previous\nstate of where you want it.\n\n543\n00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.880\nAnd you can redo things if you feel\nthat now you need to go back to exactly\n\n544\n00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.400\nwhere you change too.\n\n545\n00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.870\nI don't know if those troubles have been\nuseful just in line with the other three.\n\n546\n00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.823\n>> Yes.\nThese are incredibly useful tools,\n\n547\n00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:53.431\nespecially when you don't remember\nwhy you put what you put there.\n\n548\n00:31:53.431 --> 00:31:56.539\n[LAUGH] I have done that so many times\nwhere I have continued to do something and\n\n549\n00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:58.060\nthen I realized something.\n\n550\n00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.210\nThat is not where I needed that to be.\n\n551\n00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.980\nWell, instead of me trying to now read\nthe whole thing over again and go,\n\n552\n00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.250\nwhat did I just do?\n\n553\n00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:08.455\nI can just hit Control+Z, or\nControl+Z, excuse me, I used Z there.\n\n554\n00:32:08.455 --> 00:32:12.430\nControl+Z, and that will bring\nme back to that previous state.\n\n555\n00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:16.220\nAnd then I can go down, if I need to,\nand start typing what I need.\n\n556\n00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.619\nSo I use that more often than I use that\nControl+Y function on the redo because\n\n557\n00:32:20.619 --> 00:32:23.917\na lot of times when I end up typing and\nthere's a mistake,\n\n558\n00:32:23.917 --> 00:32:27.494\nnot necessarily something that\nI wanna see happen again, but\n\n559\n00:32:27.494 --> 00:32:32.079\nthis is all part of using that clipboard\nfunction that we have available to us.\n\n560\n00:32:32.079 --> 00:32:36.399\nNow Dr. Tonney I think there's a lot\nmore for us to actually cover, but\n\n561\n00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:41.151\nwe are out of time, and that means we are\ngonna have to extend this into a Part Two\n\n562\n00:32:41.151 --> 00:32:43.743\nfor us actually just navigating around and\n\n563\n00:32:43.743 --> 00:32:47.727\nbeing able to figure out how to get\naround to Microsoft Office 201.\n\n564\n00:32:47.727 --> 00:32:49.805\nThat sound like Sound\nlike a good idea to you?\n\n565\n00:32:49.805 --> 00:32:51.597\n>> Absolutely,\nI actually need a break as well.\n\n566\n00:32:51.597 --> 00:32:55.183\nI mean there's so much excitement here,\nbut unless you remind me once in a while,\n\n567\n00:32:55.183 --> 00:32:56.485\nI get carried away.\n\n568\n00:32:56.485 --> 00:32:58.095\nWe've taken a little moment and\n\n569\n00:32:58.095 --> 00:33:03.590\ncaught up with one of the various basic\nparts of Microsoft Application interface.\n\n570\n00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:08.023\nSome of the common features of all\nMicrosoft applications, we didn't exhaust\n\n571\n00:33:08.023 --> 00:33:11.924\nthem, but we'll be back and\nwe'll go to the Part Two of this section,\n\n572\n00:33:11.924 --> 00:33:16.821\nwhere we actually ourselves into opening,\nsaving, and creating data files,\n\n573\n00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:21.388\nprinting our work, emailing, adjusting\nsome of the application that we already\n\n574\n00:33:21.388 --> 00:33:26.050\nhave and I hope we'll be back and\nyou will join us as we learn some more.\n\n575\n00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.000\n>> All right, well that's a great\nplace for us to end this episode then.\n\n576\n00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.380\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n577\n00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.540\n>> And my name is Dr. Tonney Monsa,\nenjoying myself as we learn together.\n\n578\n00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.451\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore computer fundamentals.\n\n579\n00:33:41.451 --> 00:33:46.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.820\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and you're\nwatching Computing Fundamentals IC3.\n\n4\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.240\nI'm here with Dr. Tonny Omwansa.\n\n5\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.880\nHe's going to help us as we\ncontinue on this Part 2 of\n\n6\n00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.600\nlearning about the interface here\nbetween Microsoft Office 2010.\n\n7\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.730\nWelcome back Doctor Tonny.\n\n8\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.140\n>> Thanks very much,\nit's always great being here.\n\n9\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.500\nI enjoy the learning, it's fun.\n\n10\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.350\nI hope our viewers are also\nenjoying it the same way.\n\n11\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.340\n>> I do too.\n\n12\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.270\nSo, last time, when we took a look, we\nwere just wrapping up just a few things,\n\n13\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.080\nbut we have a lot more for\nus to actually go over, and\n\n14\n00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.500\nyou've been showing us how we can actually\nuse things like the shortcuts, right?\n\n15\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.060\nThe Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y to really\nhelp us to do a few things quicker,\n\n16\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.410\nbut there's a lot more for us to do,\nand we're gonna take a look this time\n\n17\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.700\nto some of the things you said,\ndon't worry about us taking look at.\n\n18\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.954\nYou're gonna show us how you do that,\nright?\n\n19\n00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:06.603\n>> Yeah, slowly but\nsurely, we're gonna learn.\n\n20\n00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:11.071\nBasically, this is not a linear approach\nwhere you say, I'm gonna start here,\n\n21\n00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.250\nI master this, then I move to the next.\n\n22\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.630\nI master that, and\nthen I can go no, no, no.\n\n23\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.600\nAll just relaxed and learn things\nas we go get the mindset right and\n\n24\n00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.040\nthen specifics we keep improving.\n\n25\n00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.000\ntrust me some time I have used\nMicrosoft word, for a while.\n\n26\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.770\nBut everything that I have\nthought know I now know and\n\n27\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010\nsome of the thing I learned\nI have forgotten them.\n\n28\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.040\nBut you know, I keep learning as I go,\nadding little bits and pieces So\n\n29\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.450\nwe'll pick up from where we left.\n\n30\n00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.790\nThe last thing we were talking\nabout in the previous episode,\n\n31\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.790\nwe talked about the undoing and redoing,\nCtrl+Z, Ctrl+X and the like, and\n\n32\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.160\nwe're gonna pick up on something around\nmanaging text, manipulating text and\n\n33\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.890\nformatting text because for\n\n34\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.100\nme, this is one of the most important\nelements of using Microsoft Word.\n\n35\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.440\nIt's a very fact that you can format your\ntext to look in a manner that you want.\n\n36\n00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.250\nMake it bold, underline it, italicize it,\ngive it a different color, and the like.\n\n37\n00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.550\nI want us to quickly go to a group,\nThat we use to format text.\n\n38\n00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.310\nSo I'm right now on Microsoft Word.\n\n39\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.720\nRight over here is a section\naround manipulating Font.\n\n40\n00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.470\nThis group, and\nactually it's labelled here Font, and\n\n41\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.590\nthere's also something about Paragraph.\n\n42\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.280\nAnd we'll come to this one as well.\n\n43\n00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.920\nBut I just wanted to pick some of these\nelements here that are very important in\n\n44\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.720\nmanipulating text if right now I selected\nthe word Office I can increase the font so\n\n45\n00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.220\nover here I click that combo box\n\n46\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.390\nI can scroll I can see the font size\ncan actually increase or decrease.\n\n47\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.890\nIf I say 16 that's the size,\n12 come down all the way to eight.\n\n48\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.400\nSo see you can manipulate\nthe font size very easily.\n\n49\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.640\nI mean just assuming you're\ngonna do this tying,\n\n50\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.150\nit would have been really complicated.\n\n51\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.160\nSo this is making life much easier,\nworking much easier.\n\n52\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.290\nSo this font is actually font 26.\n\n53\n00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.140\nI could want to change the font type.\n\n54\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.245\nSo select.\n\n55\n00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:09.120\nThere are many ways of selecting that.\n\n56\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.670\nWe could easily start,\nscroll over there, and\n\n57\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.940\npick that one, and\nwe could change the font.\n\n58\n00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.790\nAll manner of font types here.\n\n59\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.090\nSo let me pick Ariel normal, Ariel black,\nAriel black rather, and there we go.\n\n60\n00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.320\nSo you see, I have three\ndifferent fonts now in this text.\n\n61\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.500\nI could click the one clipboard and\nI could make it red.\n\n62\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.840\nWow.\nThen all of the sudden all looks nice.\n\n63\n00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.330\nI go to the introduction to Windows 7 and\nI say well,\n\n64\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.070\nI want it to be underlined and italized.\n\n65\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.890\nThere you go.\n\n66\n00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.010\nSo this gives me an opportunity to\nmanipulate text in different ways\n\n67\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.340\nItalicize, underline, grow the font size,\nin fact, this is a short cut for\n\n68\n00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.470\ngrowing the font size.\n\n69\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.780\nSo let's say I click Windows here, over\nhere I have an opportunity rather than\n\n70\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.425\nscrolling the comment box, I could very\neasily click this And increases the font.\n\n71\n00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:03.485\nFor those of us who like shortcuts,\nI would have clicked Ctrl+Shift+Arrow.\n\n72\n00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:04.785\nAnd there we go.\n\n73\n00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:06.925\nI reduce my font using the keyboard.\n\n74\n00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:08.705\nBut you don't have to worry about that.\n\n75\n00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:10.045\nNo.\nThere are many ways of doing it.\n\n76\n00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:12.735\nI can click here, reduce my font.\n\n77\n00:04:12.735 --> 00:04:15.585\nOr if you want to change\nsomething to uppercase or\n\n78\n00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:18.055\nlowercase I can\nautomatically do uppercase.\n\n79\n00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:18.575\nBoom.\n\n80\n00:04:18.575 --> 00:04:19.245\nIt's all set.\n\n81\n00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:21.800\nI can select the whole line.\n\n82\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.090\nYou know,\nby clicking at the beginning of the line.\n\n83\n00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.880\nAnd then I go okay,\nI think I want to have this s lower case.\n\n84\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.170\nBoom, it was already lower case so\nno big deal.\n\n85\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.800\nI can say well, I want toggle case.\n\n86\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.025\nI don't know who uses that but.\n\n87\n00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:35.075\nBut, there we go.\n\n88\n00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:39.355\nSo you can play with texts just by\nselecting what you want to select and\n\n89\n00:04:39.355 --> 00:04:43.885\nmanipulate it using this particular\nfont group with the various options.\n\n90\n00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:48.125\nThere's color there, and the color here,\nit gives you the background or\n\n91\n00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:52.025\nif I want to text and leave\nthe background to be as it was, white.\n\n92\n00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.195\nThere we go.\n\n93\n00:04:53.195 --> 00:04:57.850\nYou know, you can create a very\nbeautiful document using this font.\n\n94\n00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.020\nJust simply manipulating font.\n\n95\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.080\nCuz sometimes you've seen somebody\nwho has typed something really nice,\n\n96\n00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.640\nthe font is italicized or really creative.\n\n97\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.880\nIt was simple, selecting the font,\nselecting the text,\n\n98\n00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.390\nand picking which kind\nof font they wanted.\n\n99\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.730\nThe font size, underline things,\nand things like that.\n\n100\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.440\nSo I hope this is something that\nyour user found useful in working\n\n101\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.030\non document\n>> There's no doubt that being able to\n\n102\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.790\npick out certain words and\nbeing able to select the text I want, and\n\n103\n00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.960\nemphasizing the way that I want to by\nchanging those up, really do help.\n\n104\n00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.860\nNow what Dr. Tony showed though\nis a very granular approach, and\n\n105\n00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.370\na very singular approach at the same time.\n\n106\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.660\nIf you look at his doc, and I know that\nhe didn't mean to create it this way But\n\n107\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.520\neven though he showed us all\nthose different examples,\n\n108\n00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.460\nyou notice that it doesn't look very\nunified or very much of a themed type\n\n109\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.490\nof idea in which looks that he did\nthat in a manner which he meant to.\n\n110\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.535\nHe was.\nShowing this different elements.\n\n111\n00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:58.575\nBut when you take a look at it it doesn't\nreally look like that it belongs to\n\n112\n00:05:58.575 --> 00:06:00.135\nthe rest of the document.\n\n113\n00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:03.695\nBut the neat thing about it, right,\nis that if you really do need to emphasize\n\n114\n00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:08.405\na single word by changing its color in\nthe middle of that entire paragraph,\n\n115\n00:06:08.405 --> 00:06:10.935\nyou want a single word to stand out,\nyou can do that.\n\n116\n00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:15.130\nIf you want to do it by outlining or\nmaking it bold You can do that.\n\n117\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.420\nIt allows you to be able to have that,\nnot only on a single word,\n\n118\n00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.390\nbut even a single letter if you choose to.\n\n119\n00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.800\nIt allows you to be able to be\nvery granular in that control.\n\n120\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.670\nBut there's other types of\nmanipulations that we can do\n\n121\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.000\nthat allow us to actually say, look,\nThe entire document that I have here,\n\n122\n00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.320\nI wanna see what it would look like if\nI changed everything about it instead.\n\n123\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.150\nAnd Dr. when we start taking a look at\nthat, we're now talking about what we call\n\n124\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.210\nthemes, right, and\nbeing able to work with those?\n\n125\n00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.750\n>> Yes, you can create a specific\ntheme that you can use.\n\n126\n00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.100\nSo that the whole document\nlooks in a certain way.\n\n127\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.540\nSo think of something that you wanna\nspend some time if you do have time but\n\n128\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:02.370\nbefore I go in to the things, a little\nbit talking about the color pallets and\n\n129\n00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.210\nthen I'll get back to the theme shortly.\n\n130\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.870\nSo when you say I want something\nto look in a certain color See,\n\n131\n00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.050\nyou can select the color.\n\n132\n00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.680\nAnd right now when we were picking\nthe color, so I go back to my document and\n\n133\n00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.810\nthen, probably all this,\nthis is really crowded.\n\n134\n00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.780\nSo I'm gonna scroll down so\nthat it's a little clearer.\n\n135\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.020\nSo if I pick paragraph here for\n\n136\n00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.050\nexample, I did mention that we have\nan option of selecting the color.\n\n137\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.300\nOr of a text or the background.\n\n138\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.950\nNow similarly,\nI do have a palette here and\n\n139\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.330\na palette gives you an opportunity to\nlook at different colors at one goal.\n\n140\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.930\nSo what would I like to select?\n\n141\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.512\nSo it's a set of colors that you can\npick so let say, well I'm interested and\n\n142\n00:07:47.512 --> 00:07:52.238\nas you can see as I scroll all over the\nplace a background is actually changing on\n\n143\n00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:56.705\nthe text As I moved and\npicked I selected that as my background.\n\n144\n00:07:56.705 --> 00:07:59.232\nSo that color palette is\nbasically a grid that\n\n145\n00:07:59.232 --> 00:08:02.031\ngives you an opportunity\nto choose what you want.\n\n146\n00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:03.712\nI want to talk about the theme.\n\n147\n00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:07.157\nThis is a set of formatting presets,\nall right.\n\n148\n00:08:07.157 --> 00:08:12.980\nIt gives you an opportunity to select\na set that somehow is predefined.\n\n149\n00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.970\nSo when you open a new document\nyou could very easily say, well,\n\n150\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:22.830\nI want it to have a particular\nkind of font overall,\n\n151\n00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:27.030\nas my titles and I want some titles\nto look in a certain way and\n\n152\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.910\nI want the text to look in a certain way.\n\n153\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.964\nSo you can select a theme and\nwork with that theme throughout.\n\n154\n00:08:31.964 --> 00:08:36.515\nThe beautiful thing about themes is that\nyou know, you don't want things to look so\n\n155\n00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:37.920\nmixed up and jumbled up.\n\n156\n00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.240\nThere was no pattern.\n\n157\n00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.750\nThere was no formula.\n\n158\n00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.835\nI'm celebrating all the colors.\n\n159\n00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:45.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The human\n\n160\n00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.290\nmind has a way of processing content.\n\n161\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:52.250\nAnd when I start seeing too many colors at\none go kind of brain gets a big confused,\n\n162\n00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.540\nso it's always good to play\nwith about three, four,\n\n163\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.760\nfive max different kinds of colors.\n\n164\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.900\nAnd they have match.\n\n165\n00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.380\nNot everybody is blessed with the capacity\nof seeing very well matching of colors.\n\n166\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.920\nNot all of us has that strength.\n\n167\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.630\nPersonally I struggle with a few of that,\nsome colors rarely match.\n\n168\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.910\nYou know, when somebody tells me,\nno those don't match, and I say,\n\n169\n00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.460\nwell no but they match.\n\n170\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.580\nThat's why things have been created,\n\n171\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.670\nto help us, you know,\na lot of thought has gone into that.\n\n172\n00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.180\nAnd we call that human\ncomputer interaction.\n\n173\n00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.730\nThe way that human interacts with\na computer, you have to be sensitive about\n\n174\n00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.890\nthat, otherwise people get overwhelmed\nwhen they think about what they see.\n\n175\n00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.990\nAll right.\n\n176\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.490\nI don't know whether you\nwant to say anything\n\n177\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.140\nabout the themes generally Ronnie.\n\n178\n00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.780\n>> Yeah, I'm actually seeing this in\nuse in a very productive way as well.\n\n179\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.240\nWhen one company was actually bought\nby another company they were using one\n\n180\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.950\nparticular style and formatting for\nall their documents Dr. Toney, but\n\n181\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.940\nwhen the other company came over they\nsaid, we need those documents but\n\n182\n00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.350\nwe need them to follow our particular\nformatting and our pattern.\n\n183\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.580\nWell, they could have done that,\nthey could have gone in and\n\n184\n00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.620\ndone exactly what Dr. Toney showed you.\n\n185\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.180\nHighlight every single word\nthat they needed changed,\n\n186\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.640\nthen change it individually one at a time.\n\n187\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.090\nBut the great thing is that\nnew company used a theme and\n\n188\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.960\nthat allowed them then to open\nup that document inside of Word.\n\n189\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.005\nAnd apply the theme and\n\n190\n00:10:12.005 --> 00:10:16.810\nit automatically formated it the way\nthat that company is now existing.\n\n191\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.516\nSo it saves time, it's productive, it\nallows you to be as you say those things,\n\n192\n00:10:21.516 --> 00:10:26.225\nthose colors do match and they go together\nor even that font style and type whether\n\n193\n00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:30.930\nyou're using headers or any other\ndocument or text that you have in mind.\n\n194\n00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.880\nIt aligns everything up\nto the way that needs to.\n\n195\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.740\nSo it is a very fast way that you can\nformat documents to a particular presets\n\n196\n00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:44.060\nnow, or even to a conformity or\na pattern or a particular protocol\n\n197\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:49.000\nthat your company may use and that way all\nyour documentation looks very uniform.\n\n198\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.970\nAnd it's very necessary to do so.\n\n199\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.050\nYou may not find, you may go,\nI wanna be creative, but remember,\n\n200\n00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.650\nif you're working for somebody else and\nthey're saying this is the way it's gonna\n\n201\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:01.330\nbe, using something like this can help you\nchange all your documents the way that\n\n202\n00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.710\nthey need it instead of\nthe way you just want to.\n\n203\n00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.010\nGo ahead and go on,\nno I'm creative enough.\n\n204\n00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:10.270\nSo it really is incredibly helpful\nwhen you choose to do this and\n\n205\n00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.790\nit makes it easier for other people\nas well when you choose to do this.\n\n206\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.750\nThat means that they can go ahead and\ntake it.\n\n207\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.890\nAnd if they end up using it on\ntheir particular department and\n\n208\n00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.810\nthey have a different theme well they\njust apply that theme instead of\n\n209\n00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.120\nhaving to go back and re-correct all the\nthings that you might have done as well.\n\n210\n00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.988\nSo very practical way to\nactually be creative.\n\n211\n00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.336\n>> Wow great.\n\n212\n00:11:30.336 --> 00:11:31.010\n>> Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.430\n>> Now let's talk about objects you know,\nalways,\n\n214\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:41.230\nat all times that we use that\nspecific things in this environment.\n\n215\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:46.000\nSo, an object is something that can stand\nalone in a Microsoft Word document or\n\n216\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.910\nany other, and we can manipulate it,\nwe can move it around, we can resize it.\n\n217\n00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.740\nIt has some kind of a frame\nthat you can play with.\n\n218\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.070\nSo think about an image.\n\n219\n00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.850\nIf I was to put an image\nin Microsoft Word,\n\n220\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.540\nwhich is not text,\nwe've been playing with text.\n\n221\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.020\nSo now if I put an image and I need to\nresize it or move it from one place or\n\n222\n00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.290\nanother, then it has to have\nseveral characteristics, and\n\n223\n00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.250\nthat's why we call it an object.\n\n224\n00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.900\nSo what I've just done in my computer now\nis that I've opened a new Word document.\n\n225\n00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.770\nAnd I have put an object.\n\n226\n00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.710\nNow that object has something we\ncall selection handles rather,\n\n227\n00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.040\nwhich helps me to play with\nthat particular object,\n\n228\n00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.830\nI don't know if anybody can relate\nwith the logo that I have put here.\n\n229\n00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.371\nThis logo is for\nan organisation called, I Chose Life.\n\n230\n00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:36.363\nAnd I Chose Life is the partner in this\nproject trying to increase digital\n\n231\n00:12:36.363 --> 00:12:39.196\nliteracy, digital learning etcetera.\n\n232\n00:12:39.196 --> 00:12:45.520\nAnd so I Chose Life has a logo, now let's\nsay this document, I want to resize\n\n233\n00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:52.270\nthis logo when I click the logo you can\nsee some lines appearing around this logo.\n\n234\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.790\nAnd when I click outside\nthe logo those lines disappear.\n\n235\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.730\nSo when I click, those lines\n\n236\n00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.490\nare more like selection handles that\nhelp me to manipulate this image.\n\n237\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:08.290\nSo if I click at the corner,\nall of a sudden, my changes.\n\n238\n00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:14.030\nIt's ship, and if I click, hold on,\nit means that I have selected that\n\n239\n00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:19.900\nparticular part, and if I scroll up and\ndown, I can actually resize the object.\n\n240\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.990\nIf I click on the right, and\n\n241\n00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.320\nI hold down see what happens to that logo,\nit just just shape.\n\n242\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.620\nI sure I Choose Life will not be\nhappy with me if I leave it that way.\n\n243\n00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.778\nSo I have to go back I can go back\nto my undo, remember CTRL + Z?\n\n244\n00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:36.970\nI can actually click CTRL + Z and\nits goes back exactly where it was.\n\n245\n00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.300\nThe good thing about,\n\n246\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.660\nif you click the corners it means you can\nresize it vertically and horizontally.\n\n247\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.946\nSo if I do this and\nthen I scroll proportionately,\n\n248\n00:13:46.946 --> 00:13:48.752\nI have resized the object.\n\n249\n00:13:48.752 --> 00:13:53.783\nBut if I click on the right, on the top,\nand resize then it becomes a bit\n\n250\n00:13:53.783 --> 00:13:59.900\nun-proportional because I am only resizing\nthe height or width for that matter.\n\n251\n00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.210\nSo this way an object it\ncan be anything else.\n\n252\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.560\nI could very easily insert something here,\nlike it a picture, and\n\n253\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.280\nI don't have a picture,\ndon't worry too much about that picture.\n\n254\n00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.660\nBut, there you go, I can resize\na picture and it becomes smaller.\n\n255\n00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.000\nIt was a very big picture.\n\n256\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.260\nSo it doesn't matter,\nI can resize it three times, four times,\n\n257\n00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.700\nnow if we come in clearer,\nit's proportionate.\n\n258\n00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.840\nAlright, there we go.\n\n259\n00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.730\nAnd it's, I can resize that until it is so\n\n260\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.630\nsmall that it is even\nsmaller than that logo.\n\n261\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.710\nIt could be anything.\n\n262\n00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.425\nAnd I can play around with that image,\nin a number of ways,\n\n263\n00:14:33.425 --> 00:14:37.165\nI can change the I can\ngive you the shadow,\n\n264\n00:14:37.165 --> 00:14:40.865\nI can give it see it's already\nlooking very interesting right?\n\n265\n00:14:40.865 --> 00:14:42.735\nYou can play around with different things,\n\n266\n00:14:42.735 --> 00:14:46.785\nwhich are images that you are working\nwith, so at this point the last thing I'm\n\n267\n00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:52.600\ngoing to talk about is saving,\nopening, and creating new files.\n\n268\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.090\nI don't know, before we get into that,\nRonald always has some very good ideas,\n\n269\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.080\nespecially where he has\napplied these kind of things.\n\n270\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.810\nI'm very sure he has applied images and\nobjects in his document.\n\n271\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.498\nMaybe let's get some\nstory around this one.\n\n272\n00:15:05.498 --> 00:15:08.000\n>> [LAUGH] There's know doubt that\nI've actually used these in different\n\n273\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.550\norganizations to help them apply their own\nCompany Logo, let's say to a letterhead,\n\n274\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.940\nand the idea of that Company Logo\ndepending on what needs to be done.\n\n275\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.040\nJust like what Doctor Toney was saying,\nthat if you actually make it\n\n276\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.740\nnot proportional the way that you want to,\nwell that company's not gonna be happy.\n\n277\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.477\nSo understanding how to\nmanipulate that image,\n\n278\n00:15:27.477 --> 00:15:30.412\nby using the corners,y ou\ncan actually drag it in and\n\n279\n00:15:30.412 --> 00:15:34.167\nout toward the center of that object\nto keep the same proportions.\n\n280\n00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:38.318\nBut if you do have a particular image that\nyou know that can actually look wider, and\n\n281\n00:15:38.318 --> 00:15:41.105\nthen you can actually use of\ncourse that vertical side or\n\n282\n00:15:41.105 --> 00:15:45.021\nyou can actually use the horizontals to\nactually help you to extend that out and\n\n283\n00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:46.712\nmake it the size that you need to.\n\n284\n00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:49.828\nAlong with that, of course,\nis choosing the actual,\n\n285\n00:15:49.828 --> 00:15:52.686\nright image that you have\nto be careful of as well.\n\n286\n00:15:52.686 --> 00:15:56.230\nResizing objects can be\na little bit unusual.\n\n287\n00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.488\nEspecially when you choose an image and\nDr.\n\n288\n00:15:58.488 --> 00:16:02.150\nTommy actually gave us a good one\nin that big gigantic picture.\n\n289\n00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.190\nWell, it's kinda strange and you'll notice\nthis happening too if you try this.\n\n290\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.040\nIf you keep resizing the object in and\nout.\n\n291\n00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.650\nAfter a while you're going to see that the\npicture gets fuzzy and that's because it's\n\n292\n00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:17.480\na special type of object Inside that what\nhappens is that as you squeeze it in,\n\n293\n00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.380\nit's like a sponge where you've now got it\nfull of water and you're wringing it out.\n\n294\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.590\nAnd it actually lets go of all that water.\n\n295\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.530\nWell the picture's doing the same thing\nwhen you actually squeeze it down to\n\n296\n00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.090\na certain size.\n\n297\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:32.640\nIt's still trying to keep that same amount\nof what looks like the picture, but\n\n298\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.840\nit's now lost all those pixels.\n\n299\n00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.480\nWhen you expand backout.\n\n300\n00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.740\nYour telling the computer processor,\n\n301\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.970\nfill in those gaps to make it\nlook like the image again.\n\n302\n00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.610\nAnd it can do a really good\njob at the majority of it.\n\n303\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.910\nBut you lose some.\n\n304\n00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.490\nAnd if you keep doing that, were you\nexpand it in or out after a while.\n\n305\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.890\nYou'll gonna see,\nthere's gonna lose some of that.\n\n306\n00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.770\nAnd it's gonna get fuzzier and fuzzier.\n\n307\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.640\nSo you do have to be careful with it.\n\n308\n00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.000\nBut it is something that you can do\nespecially when you're moving logos.\n\n309\n00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.410\nWhen you wanna create\nlet's say a newsletter,\n\n310\n00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:04.540\nand you wanna add in those images,\nperfectly fine that you do so, but just\n\n311\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.120\nmake sure that as you add in, don't do a\nlot of this even though it seems like fun.\n\n312\n00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.100\nChoose the image, leave it the size it is,\nalways shrink it down.\n\n313\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.850\nGetting it larger is probably\njust gonna make it fuzzy.\n\n314\n00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.620\nSo I'm actually done this quite a bit.\n\n315\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.540\nMicrosoft Word is a perfect type\nof product for you to be able to\n\n316\n00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.160\nuse if you wanted to do something like\nthat, like a newsletter as well, or\n\n317\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.150\nany type of document, or a flyer that\nyou might be advertising something on.\n\n318\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.830\nIt really can help you out quite a bit\ncuz then you can take that image and\n\n319\n00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.250\nalso re-angle it and resize it.\n\n320\n00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.050\nYou name it, it allows you to do that and\nflow the text around it as well.\n\n321\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.200\nMany different ways you can use images\nto help enhance your particular\n\n322\n00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.770\ndocument that you have in place and\n\n323\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:53.270\nthat's true regardless of whether\nwe're talking about Microsoft Word.\n\n324\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.900\nOr Powerpoint or even Excel to help\nyou emphasize that point, not so\n\n325\n00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.110\nmuch in access, but\n\n326\n00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.920\noverall though those three products\nat least, great places to use images.\n\n327\n00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.480\n>> Also, you know,\nevery time you create a document,\n\n328\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.730\nchances are very high\nyou're going to save it.\n\n329\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.340\nNot always, but\nmany cases you'll probably will save it so\n\n330\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.870\nthat you can access it later.\n\n331\n00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.020\nSo it is important to\nunderstand how files are save.\n\n332\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.110\nNow what's a File?\n\n333\n00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:26.640\nWhatever we just opened now and we created\nsomething inside there we call it a file.\n\n334\n00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.190\nWe save it and we give it a name.\n\n335\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.680\nSo each file is likely to be\nstored somewhere so for us, for\n\n336\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.380\npurposes of interacting with the computer,\nwe really don't want to know so much of\n\n337\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.680\nwhat's happening in the background,\nbut at least we know one thing.\n\n338\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.460\nWe have saved it in a particular folder or\na particular space and\n\n339\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.320\nwe can easily access it.\n\n340\n00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.780\nSo in order for me to demonstrate and\nexplain the saving,\n\n341\n00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.690\nthe opening I just first\nof all as to understand it,\n\n342\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.580\nthere is something called file types,\nso files are of different types.\n\n343\n00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.880\nHere's an illustration my screen right now\n\n344\n00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.670\nI have opened Explorer basically\nI have gone into the computer and\n\n345\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:12.240\nI am looking at files that\nare stored in a particular location.\n\n346\n00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.630\nNow what you can see my font might not be\nvery visible there, it might be a little\n\n347\n00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:22.640\nsmall but at least the point is every\nfile that is in this fonder has a name,\n\n348\n00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.170\nso I have basically copied several\nfiles in here they have a name and\n\n349\n00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:31.130\nthey have a date there they were made so\nthese are second column, and\n\n350\n00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.610\nthen there is the type of file.\n\n351\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:38.130\nWhat is the type of that file,\nand the size of that file.\n\n352\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.180\nPeople who spend a lot of time in\nthis thing they call that metadata,\n\n353\n00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.150\nwhich is data about data.\n\n354\n00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:46.590\nSo the file in there is data, but\nwe're trying to explain what it is.\n\n355\n00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:51.070\nSo over here in my exploration\nI now see different types.\n\n356\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.080\nIf I click right on the top here,\nI can see a type.\n\n357\n00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.370\nSo I've clicked type, and\nI've organized them in terms of type.\n\n358\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:03.030\nSo what is starting,\nthe first set is Microsoft Word 2007,\n\n359\n00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.900\nI mean 1997 to 2003 documents.\n\n360\n00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:10.030\nAll of them grouped together,\nor I can click by date so\n\n361\n00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:15.570\nfor now I just want us to understand\nif I was to do something and\n\n362\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.970\nsave a document where would I find it?\n\n363\n00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.660\nAnd what name would it be?\n\n364\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.240\nAnd what extension would it be?\n\n365\n00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.186\nAll documents that are of\nMicrosoft Word are ending with\n\n366\n00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:33.093\na .d ocr.docx\n\n367\n00:20:33.093 --> 00:20:38.550\nthat's really what's the important\npoint at the moment.\n\n368\n00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.840\nWhen we get to other margins,\n\n369\n00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.130\nthey will also be ending with an\nextension, a different kind of extension.\n\n370\n00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.920\nSo let's go back to my Word\ndocument that we had created.\n\n371\n00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.030\nIt had some logo here and an image so\n\n372\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:55.690\nif I go to file,\nI can see several options here.\n\n373\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:02.090\nI can see save, save as,\nsave as Adobe PDF, open, close.\n\n374\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.120\nThis is what I want us to focus on,\nthis particular section.\n\n375\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.250\nSo if I say save as,\n\n376\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:12.190\nit means I want to determine where to\nsave it and in what format to save it.\n\n377\n00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.700\nThat's the important part.\n\n378\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:18.570\nIf I say save It typically going to save\nit in the name that it currently has, and\n\n379\n00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.930\nin the location that it is assumed to be.\n\n380\n00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:28.470\nIf I say save as Adobe PDF, it's going to\nconvert it to a different format, format.\n\n381\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.860\nThe first two option give us\nan opportunity to save it as a Microsoft\n\n382\n00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.340\nword document.\n\n383\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.840\nIf I say open, it'll give me\nopportunity to open the document that\n\n384\n00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.750\nhad already been saved,\nwhether by myself or someone else.\n\n385\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.260\nAnd if I say close,\nit's going to shut down and\n\n386\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.830\npossibly ask me if I want to\nsave the document or not.\n\n387\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.485\nSo let us say I want to save as.\n\n388\n00:21:49.485 --> 00:21:55.870\nSo, I click as,\nit's opened some mechanism here to save.\n\n389\n00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.010\nWere getting to that detail later.\n\n390\n00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.820\nSo, what can I see here\nis a place to select\n\n391\n00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.730\nthe address of where I want to save it and\nthe name I want to save it.\n\n392\n00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.100\nAnd here I have also to select\nwhere I could possibly save it.\n\n393\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:15.070\nSo what I wanted to do is that I\nwant to go a place called desktop.\n\n394\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:19.350\nDon't worry too much about what that\nis but there's a place called desktop.\n\n395\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.400\nSo I'm at desktop, and\nI look around and say, well.\n\n396\n00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:28.580\nWithin desktop, I want to find the folder\nand the folder is called temp, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.340\nSo I click temp and then I say open.\n\n398\n00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.790\nSo what has happened up here?\n\n399\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.750\nNow I have a pass, you have a path an you\nknow like a path and we'll discuss this\n\n400\n00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:44.460\na little later about exactly how files\nare organised by the operating system,\n\n401\n00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.920\nso we have a folder there called temp and\na document called doc10.\n\n402\n00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.960\nBut maybe I don't think doc 10 really\nmeans much so I can give it a name I\n\n403\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.760\ncan relate with later on when I\ncome to look for the document.\n\n404\n00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.420\nSo I am going to say sample document.\n\n405\n00:23:02.558 --> 00:23:06.080\nSo File, save as, something happened.\n\n406\n00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:13.710\nSo I go here, I delete doc and\nsay a sample document during show.\n\n407\n00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:18.140\nAll right, so I go to where I wanted to\nsave it, desktop, then I look for temp.\n\n408\n00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.759\n[SOUND] Then I put it in temp.\n\n409\n00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:26.790\nNow I find temp, and\nthen the name of the document.\n\n410\n00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.290\nThen, I say what type?\n\n411\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.660\nSo, it's asking me a save as type.\n\n412\n00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.200\nI could save it as anything.\n\n413\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.850\nIt could be at least for\nthe option that exists.\n\n414\n00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:36.900\nIt could be a Word document.\n\n415\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.000\nI could convert it to a PDF.\n\n416\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.050\nYou don't worry too much\nabout all of the things here.\n\n417\n00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.950\nThe point is,\nthat I can save it a particular type.\n\n418\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.980\nSo, I save it.\n\n419\n00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.789\nAs a Word document, and say save.\n\n420\n00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:53.562\nSo what has happened is that document has\nbeen saved somewhere with the name, and\n\n421\n00:23:53.562 --> 00:23:56.017\nyou can see up here,\nthe name has actually changed.\n\n422\n00:23:56.017 --> 00:23:59.481\nIt's sample document\nduring show Microsoft One.\n\n423\n00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:03.276\nIf right now I choose to close it, it\nwon't ask me if I want to save it because\n\n424\n00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:07.255\nit's already been save, but if I make\nany changes right now, it would ask me,\n\n425\n00:24:07.255 --> 00:24:09.905\ndo you want to save the changes or not?\n\n426\n00:24:09.905 --> 00:24:12.435\nI hope this has given\nan opportunity to understand that\n\n427\n00:24:12.435 --> 00:24:16.295\nthere's something called saving,\nstoring something somewhere.\n\n428\n00:24:16.295 --> 00:24:18.765\nNow where to store is a detail?\n\n429\n00:24:18.765 --> 00:24:20.811\nWe can store things on our computer,\n\n430\n00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:25.563\nwe can store things from something called\nthe cloud which is some storage somewhere,\n\n431\n00:24:25.563 --> 00:24:30.183\nwe can store something in a computer in\nanother location within the network, local\n\n432\n00:24:30.183 --> 00:24:34.761\narea network where there are collections\nof computers that are interconnected.\n\n433\n00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:38.646\nWe can store something on\nan external memory disk and\n\n434\n00:24:38.646 --> 00:24:42.794\nI use this as an example,\nI could store something in this\n\n435\n00:24:42.794 --> 00:24:47.730\nexternal memory that I can connect\nphysically to the computer.\n\n436\n00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:52.330\nSo, right here is a way of storing\nsomething and once I've saved it in here,\n\n437\n00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:57.800\nI can actually give my colleague\nto open it in their own computer.\n\n438\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.700\nIf I wanted to find the document\nthat already exists,\n\n439\n00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.810\nI can simply say file, open, boom.\n\n440\n00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.470\nAnd I have an opportunity, I already\ncan see the document that I saved.\n\n441\n00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:13.360\nBut let me say, I want to open\na different document, so let me look for\n\n442\n00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.110\na document that was saved\nby someone in here.\n\n443\n00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.530\nTemplate day three.\n\n444\n00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:21.280\nBoom.\n\n445\n00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.600\nI've got a document here that is already\nworked on, look, somebody already put\n\n446\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.420\nthe table, he put a logo,\nthere's some nice little formatting here.\n\n447\n00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.960\nI can see text.\n\n448\n00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.060\nIt's already been done.\n\n449\n00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.360\nI can see tables here,\nnumber, things like that.\n\n450\n00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.610\nAnd I can make a change on this\ndocument and save it again.\n\n451\n00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.230\nSo here's an opportunity for you to create\nas many documents as you possibly can,\n\n452\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:49.370\nstore them, move them around,\nunderstand that they're of a certain type.\n\n453\n00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.120\nThis is a Word document.\n\n454\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.520\nSomething can be and Excel document,\nsomething can be a PowerPoint document.\n\n455\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.780\nSo it can be different types.\n\n456\n00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:02.230\nAnd they can all be stored in the same\nlocation or different location and\n\n457\n00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.520\nwe can make copies of the same\ndocument that we already created.\n\n458\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.210\nSo here you go, you're already empowered,\nyou can create documents,\n\n459\n00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.840\nyou can save those documents,\nyou can open those documents,\n\n460\n00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.860\nyou can make changes on those documents.\n\n461\n00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.150\nYou can save them and\nmove them around, and\n\n462\n00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.260\nnow you know there are different\ntypes of documents.\n\n463\n00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.930\n>> When we start taking a look here at\nthe idea of saving these documents,\n\n464\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.770\nthey are very important\nthat you provide a name and\n\n465\n00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.590\nthat you do know the location that\nthey're saved in, so that of course,\n\n466\n00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:32.130\nyou can reuse them later on if\nyou need to modify something or\n\n467\n00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:37.220\nif you actually need to change something\nin terms of what the content is.\n\n468\n00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.966\nOr there's just a file name\nthat you need to change.\n\n469\n00:26:39.966 --> 00:26:42.660\nFirst of course is you have to locate it\non your computer somewhere or whereever\n\n470\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.990\nit is stored and then of course you need\nan application that will open it up.\n\n471\n00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:52.420\nWhen Dr. Tony talked about in the file\nextension is a very important part\n\n472\n00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.930\nof that name saving that we talked about\nbecause that is what the operating system\n\n473\n00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:02.850\nuses to say this particular file is gonna\nnow be associated with this application.\n\n474\n00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.520\nSo itknows exactly what application will\nbe able to open that up without having to\n\n475\n00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.980\nask us, so it makes it easier for\nus when we do that.\n\n476\n00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:15.520\nBy understanding that it's saving it that\nway, you and I do not need to decide,\n\n477\n00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.000\nam I gonna use Microsoft Excel to open\nup this document that Dr. Tony made.\n\n478\n00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.690\nAm I gonna have to actually ask someone\nwhat particular application do I need?\n\n479\n00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:28.050\nAll I need is a file that Dr.\nTony saved on that thumb drive.\n\n480\n00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:33.100\nHe gives me the thumb drive, when I put\nit on to my computer and I can actually\n\n481\n00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.650\nopen that, well, a lot of times, all you\nhave to do is now go on to my explorer and\n\n482\n00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:42.560\nsimply double click on that file and\nmy machine will automatically recognize\n\n483\n00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.870\nthat extension of that .doc or docx and\n\n484\n00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:52.520\nuse Word to open that document up without\nme having to decide that a lot of times.\n\n485\n00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.640\nBut you may find out that there\nare certain types of documents\n\n486\n00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.290\nwhich don't have that file extension and\nwhen you try and open it that way it says,\n\n487\n00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.530\nhey what do you want to use to try and\nopen this up?\n\n488\n00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:06.920\nRemember, saving it with that extension\nis probably actually going to be helpful\n\n489\n00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.950\nbecause you don't have to decide anymore.\n\n490\n00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:14.000\nAnd by default inside of Microsoft Office,\nit automatically associates it\n\n491\n00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.380\nwith that particular application as\nyou save it in that application.\n\n492\n00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.470\nSo inside of Word when you save it, it's\ngonna automatically add that extension for\n\n493\n00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:24.800\nyou, .docx.\n\n494\n00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:31.420\nIf you're in Excel it's gonna be xlsx,\nI can't say that.\n\n495\n00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.770\nA lot of similar terms there.\n\n496\n00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.260\nAnd you are actually see that as well.\n\n497\n00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.270\nYou don't have to worry about typing that\neach time cuz it will simply add it for\n\n498\n00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.730\nyou as you save it in those documents.\n\n499\n00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.650\nSo, it is a very important concept\nthat we do need to know, location and\n\n500\n00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.290\nof course the name of that file.\n\n501\n00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.900\nIt is going to help you 100% of the time\nif you ever need to get access to\n\n502\n00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.420\nthat document again.\n\n503\n00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.970\nSo, Dr. Tony, is there any last\nthings that we need to think about\n\n504\n00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.710\nin terms of just overall\nworking with Microsoft Office?\n\n505\n00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:05.370\n>> Yes, there's quite a lot that we could\ngo on but I just want to conclude on two\n\n506\n00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.570\nimportant elements of working with\nthis Microsoft Word documents.\n\n507\n00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.360\nAs a generic framework,\n\n508\n00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.020\nbefore we again immerse ourselves\ninto a specific Word document.\n\n509\n00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.740\nThen also Excel and Access, etc.\n\n510\n00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.900\nSo, what I want us to learn now as we\nconclude is spellchecking our documents\n\n511\n00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.820\nand also printing our documents.\n\n512\n00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.930\nEvery time you type something,\nyou can make mistakes, and we're human and\n\n513\n00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:35.000\nwe make mistakes, like, I've made\na lot when I was talking, isn't it?\n\n514\n00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.220\nAnyway, so,\nlet's say I was typing in my document, and\n\n515\n00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.430\nI will try to increase this font so\nthat we can see.\n\n516\n00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.040\nI was typing something and\n\n517\n00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.580\nI realize I'm not very sure about\nthe spelling of a certain word.\n\n518\n00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:54.820\nApplications, so maybe it was one p and\nwhat happens is that Microsoft\n\n519\n00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.700\nhas developed some intelligence to try and\nfigure out what you possibly meant,\n\n520\n00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.180\nand if you meant something and\nyou didn't type it correctly it will\n\n521\n00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.710\ngive you some indicator that possibly\nthat word is not accurately spelled.\n\n522\n00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.098\nSo what you see under applications,\nthere's a red line below.\n\n523\n00:30:13.098 --> 00:30:15.880\nIf I try to increase\nthis as much as possible,\n\n524\n00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.520\nyou can see that one application\nhas a red line below.\n\n525\n00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.010\nThat red line tells me that\nsomething could possibly be wrong.\n\n526\n00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:28.190\nSo what you do is you can right\nclick it and you get options.\n\n527\n00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:33.520\nYou can get options that Microsoft Word\nthinks could be what you mean.\n\n528\n00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.278\nSo you could select the one\nthat you think is correct.\n\n529\n00:30:36.278 --> 00:30:40.595\nSo that opportunity, it just helping us so\n\n530\n00:30:40.595 --> 00:30:44.805\nthat we don't always,\nif we forget to change words or\n\n531\n00:30:44.805 --> 00:30:49.925\nspelled incorrectly, we get an reminder\njust by putting some red underline there.\n\n532\n00:30:49.925 --> 00:30:52.335\nI get a reminder,\npossibly your word is incorrect.\n\n533\n00:30:52.335 --> 00:30:53.685\nSo you can change.\n\n534\n00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:56.195\nAnother way,\nassuming that there was several words that\n\n535\n00:30:56.195 --> 00:30:59.565\nyou actually you made a mistake on and\nthat can happen.\n\n536\n00:30:59.565 --> 00:31:04.840\nSo I have three of them\nhere in this document, it's\n\n537\n00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.950\ngood to learn a few shortcuts so every\ntime we talk about something on the menu,\n\n538\n00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.230\nwe also give some shortcuts,\nin this case, I will give a shortcut.\n\n539\n00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.100\nSo if I wanted to do a spell\nchecking mechanism for\n\n540\n00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.160\nthe entire document, I can press F7.\n\n541\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.062\nWhen I press F7,\nwhat basically the Microsoft Word does,\n\n542\n00:31:22.062 --> 00:31:26.508\nit runs through and picks certain words,\ncheck things one by one and\n\n543\n00:31:26.508 --> 00:31:30.428\nasks you to make a suggestion\nof what you want for that word.\n\n544\n00:31:30.428 --> 00:31:31.587\nSo, same, I can see,\n\n545\n00:31:31.587 --> 00:31:34.920\nit gives me a suggestion that\nmaybe you wanted to say same.\n\n546\n00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.800\nSo in which case I say change.\n\n547\n00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.890\nSo that's changed it.\n\n548\n00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.330\nI can see documents.\n\n549\n00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.680\nI'd put double s.\n\n550\n00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.650\nI say change.\n\n551\n00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.300\nIf I feel that one is correct.\n\n552\n00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.000\nI can ignore it, but for\nsure in this should be changed.\n\n553\n00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.280\nApplication, I've also changed it,\nall right.\n\n554\n00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:52.020\nAnd finally it says the spelling and\ngrammar check is complete.\n\n555\n00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.720\nNow I'm done so I say OK.\n\n556\n00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.807\nSo my document looks good.\n\n557\n00:31:55.807 --> 00:31:58.604\nIt might have some problems even when\nthe spell checker is complete because it\n\n558\n00:31:58.604 --> 00:32:00.594\ndepends on how the spell\nchecker has been configured.\n\n559\n00:32:00.594 --> 00:32:04.484\nBut this is here we are.\n\n560\n00:32:04.484 --> 00:32:07.016\nSo we can take ones, we can change ones,\n\n561\n00:32:07.016 --> 00:32:10.510\nand we are helped when we\nare changing this ones.\n\n562\n00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:14.050\nThe last thing, so\nthat we can close the show, is printing.\n\n563\n00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.257\nSo once I created this document,\nwhen I'm doing Microsoft one or\n\n564\n00:32:17.257 --> 00:32:21.470\nPowerPoint or Excel, I can possibly\nprint this and create a physical copy.\n\n565\n00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:26.680\nSo what I would do is I'd go to File and\nI get an option Print.\n\n566\n00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.530\nJust, if I also may help,\nI can give you a shortcut, Control P.\n\n567\n00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.860\nBoom, takes me to the same spot.\n\n568\n00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.880\nAt that point in time,\nI can click the print button and\n\n569\n00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.420\nit will send the document to the printer.\n\n570\n00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.690\nIt is assumed in this case that\nthe printer has been installed and\n\n571\n00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:47.570\nconfigured properly, because I can send\nand I'm wondering wow, I'm waiting for\n\n572\n00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.440\nthe document to come out, but it's not.\n\n573\n00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.900\nSo the printer must have been installed,\n\n574\n00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.780\nwhich is an output device\nfrom the particular computer.\n\n575\n00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.450\nIt could be a printer\nconnected in a network or\n\n576\n00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.550\ndirectly to this particular computer,\nand I can send.\n\n577\n00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:04.035\nI can make a few changes here,\nlike I can say I want two copies or\n\n578\n00:33:04.035 --> 00:33:08.604\nI want page one to five,\nI don't want to print all the pages, or\n\n579\n00:33:08.604 --> 00:33:12.249\nI want to print back to back,\nwhatever settings.\n\n580\n00:33:12.249 --> 00:33:15.619\nBut the point is that it is possible to\nprint your document once you've worked on\n\n581\n00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:17.240\nit and you're very happy.\n\n582\n00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.020\nThe beauty about printing is that it\ncan give you an opportunity to review\n\n583\n00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:20.680\nthe document and\n\n584\n00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.200\nsee how it looks physically in as much as\nit's been shown on screen how it may look.\n\n585\n00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.130\nYou can give people to comment and\n\n586\n00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.310\nthen you can come back to your\ndocument and finally edit it.\n\n587\n00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.680\nThere are other ways of doing it.\n\n588\n00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:37.140\nBut last, printing is a powerful tool\nthat you can use in Microsoft one or\n\n589\n00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.740\nother Microsoft tools.\n\n590\n00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.940\nSo with this, I think we've\ncovered some reasonable ground and\n\n591\n00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.105\nI feel like we need some break.\n\n592\n00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:46.110\n>> [LAUGH] That sounds good to me.\n\n593\n00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.800\nWell, remember, that what you took\na look at in this episode of course\n\n594\n00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.550\nis that second part of working\nwith Microsoft Office itself.\n\n595\n00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.480\nRemember that the whole goal\nhere is to get you familiar\n\n596\n00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.100\nwith those concepts that we took\na look in both parts one and part two.\n\n597\n00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.048\nBecause regardless of which particular\nproduct you're looking at inside of\n\n598\n00:34:03.048 --> 00:34:07.119\nMicrosoft Office, the majority if not\neverything that we've shown you should\n\n599\n00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:11.371\nwork across all of them, and that should\nmake you feel much more confident, should\n\n600\n00:34:11.371 --> 00:34:15.379\nmake you feel much more relaxed hopefully\nwhen working with each one of those,\n\n601\n00:34:15.379 --> 00:34:19.058\neven if you never open them up before or\nyou've only open one up before.\n\n602\n00:34:19.058 --> 00:34:22.779\nIt will allows you to go move between\nthose products and go hey, this is not so\n\n603\n00:34:22.779 --> 00:34:24.520\nbad, its not so different.\n\n604\n00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.270\nWe can actually do that,\nand I can do that as well.\n\n605\n00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.880\nAnd that helps me out in my confidence\nwhen I start talking about working with\n\n606\n00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.920\nmore computers.\n\n607\n00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.690\nAll right.\n\n608\n00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.440\nWell that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n609\n00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.490\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronny Wong.\n\n610\n00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:42.340\n>> My name is Dr. Tony Monsat,\nits been great learning together,\n\n611\n00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.900\nI hope to see you again next time for\nthe next episode.\n\n612\n00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:51.805\n>> All right, take care, stay tuned right\nhere for more computing fundamentals.\n\n613\n00:34:51.805 --> 00:34:53.597\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

about to take a look\nat computing fundamentals.\n\n4\n00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.830\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n5\n00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.780\nwhat we're about to take a look at\nof course is getting into Word 2010.\n\n6\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.169\nAnd who better to help us than Dr.\nTonny Omwansa.\n\n7\n00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.230\nDr. Tonny, welcome back to our videos.\n\n8\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.820\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n9\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.800\nIt's always great to be here and\n\n10\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.480\nthere's always an opportunity\nto learn in a fun way.\n\n11\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.130\n>> When we start taking a look\nof course then at the idea of\n\n12\n00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.090\nwork inside of a word processing program.\n\n13\n00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.320\nThis is one of the fundamental\nskills that we all need to have.\n\n14\n00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.980\nBecause when you actually go to work and\nyou're working with computers a lot of\n\n15\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.100\ntimes you are having to produce some type\nof document which normally requires us to\n\n16\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.300\nbe able to manipulate and be able to work\naround something like Microsoft Word.\n\n17\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.690\nAnd Dr. Tonny is gonna help us to\nunderstand how we get started in\n\n18\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.260\ndoing this and\n\n19\n00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.730\nsome of the basic things that will help\nus to succeed working inside of Word.\n\n20\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.040\nSo where are we gonna start today?\n\n21\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.820\n>> So I think the best place to start is\nto connect from what we did last time.\n\n22\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.360\nSo what we were doing last\ntime is thinking about\n\n23\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.620\nthe general framework of the interface\nof Microsoft applications.\n\n24\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.440\nWe get to see how the menu's organized,\nhow to save documents, create new\n\n25\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.450\ndocuments, open them, move them around,\nunderstand file types and the like.\n\n26\n00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.630\nNow we also try to spend a little bit of\ntime thinking about generic things like\n\n27\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.270\ncopying, pasting formatting\na little bit here and there,\n\n28\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.870\nchanging color and stuff like that.\n\n29\n00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.280\nSo what we're gonna do today is we will\nimmerse ourselves a little more into\n\n30\n00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.610\nMicrosoft Word.\n\n31\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.920\nWe're gonna spend time thinking\nabout well, how do you edit and\n\n32\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.260\nformat say paragraphs or lines?\n\n33\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.100\nHow do you insert say, page numbers,\n\n34\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.910\nor how do you create new\nsections of a document.\n\n35\n00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.910\nHow do you insert an image, for\nexample, how do you create at table?\n\n36\n00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.970\nHow do you manipulate that table, create\na title, think about the columns and rows.\n\n37\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.450\nAnd also we try to think a little\nmore about how we correct our work,\n\n38\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.940\nthe quality of work we're doing, and how\ncould we possibly collaborate with others.\n\n39\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.870\nThat's what we'll spend a bit of time\ntoday and hopefully it will be fun and\n\n40\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.480\nwe'll be able to do it ourselves.\n\n41\n00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.280\n>> That sounds like a great place for\nus to start.\n\n42\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.600\nSo now that we understand how we\nget access into Microsoft Word and\n\n43\n00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.950\nwe know that when we open up we end\nup with a document at the beginning.\n\n44\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.270\nWhat else do we need to know\nnow that we've gotten in there?\n\n45\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.270\nWe might know how to type, hopefully,\nof course, you have that skill.\n\n46\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.360\nIf you don't,\nyou need to learn how to type as well.\n\n47\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.400\nBut now when we start talking about\nthe idea of editing in format text,\n\n48\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.440\nwhere do we need to begin?\n\n49\n00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.730\n>> The best place to begin\nis you have a document and\n\n50\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.590\nyou possibly have some text there\nbecause you know how to type.\n\n51\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.030\nSo right on my screen now, I've put\na section that talks about editing and\n\n52\n00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.920\nformatting text.\n\n53\n00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.230\nSo if you look at this screen,\nthe text already is in there, so\n\n54\n00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.170\nwe assume you already have\nsome text out there and\n\n55\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.832\nthe cursor is currently pointing\nat the section on paragraph.\n\n56\n00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:10.750\nAnd under that section, we're going to\nlearn a little bit about putting numbers\n\n57\n00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.680\non texts, put them in bullet font,\ntrying to create new paragraphs,\n\n58\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.560\nthink about creating breaks and\nthings like that.\n\n59\n00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.680\nSo if I open now my Word document,\nwhich I have just created,\n\n60\n00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.030\nthe text there is My title, well you can\nhave whatever title you wanna out there.\n\n61\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.570\nBut there something interesting you'll\nsee at the end of that, those two words.\n\n62\n00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.800\nThere is a sign there, and\n\n63\n00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.185\nthat sign help us to know that we\nare now moving to a new paragraph.\n\n64\n00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:42.450\n[COUGH] Between the two\nwords there is a dot.\n\n65\n00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.410\nIt helps us to know that there\nis a space between those two.\n\n66\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.910\nNow suppose you wanted to\nknow I type something but\n\n67\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.970\nI don't know how many spaces did I put,\nand I want to reduce that.\n\n68\n00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.130\nSometimes you can't see in there too, so\n\n69\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.020\nit's better to introduce a component\n[COUGH] that we use to track spaces and\n\n70\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.530\nparagraphs and right there,\nI'm pointing at it.\n\n71\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.030\nAnd if you wanted to learn a lot\nmore about it you could just press\n\n72\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.790\nF1 at that point in time.\n\n73\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.530\nBut if you see, it's what we call\na toggle in the sense that it's boolean,\n\n74\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.440\nin the sense that if I click it,\nit'll be visible, and\n\n75\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.170\nif I unclick it, it's not visible.\n\n76\n00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.240\nSo there we go.\n\n77\n00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.430\nNow I can see, wow, I have several spaces.\n\n78\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.370\nI have only one paragraph, idea.\n\n79\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.150\nSo if I get right in the middle of that\ntext, somewhere in the middle, and\n\n80\n00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.170\nI want to create a new paragraph,\nso maybe right here, For,\n\n81\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.550\nand I click the Enter button,\nit creates a paragraph for me.\n\n82\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.157\nAnd then all of a sudden, I have this mark\nover here that gives me a sense that wow,\n\n83\n00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:44.860\nyou created a paragraph.\n\n84\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.260\nI can of course undo them, remember Ctrl\n+ z and go back to where I was before.\n\n85\n00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.140\nThat give me a sense of how do I\nformat some text, how do I create\n\n86\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:02.180\na new paragraph, and how do I insure that\nI have reasonable spaces in between.\n\n87\n00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.670\nNow if you are going to format your text,\nas is now, you already have it,\n\n88\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.550\nthere are many things you can do there.\n\n89\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.280\nSo let's go back to our text and\nthink about, well,\n\n90\n00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.970\nsometimes you create a document and\nyou want some sections to look a little\n\n91\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.420\ndifferently, or the entire document\nto have a certain framework,\n\n92\n00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.480\na certain template where\nthe titles look in a certain way,\n\n93\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.720\nsubtitles look in a certain way,\nand the text look in a certain way.\n\n94\n00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.740\nSo that's what we are spending\na bit of time thinking about.\n\n95\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:38.500\nSo if you look at my document now,\nthere is a description on fonts.\n\n96\n00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.820\nSo there are theme fonts.\n\n97\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.670\nSo if I go to my document,\nwhen I click this arrow on the fonts,\n\n98\n00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.450\nthat's a drop down.\n\n99\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.540\nIt gives me an idea of the different\ntypes of fonts that exist.\n\n100\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.480\nSome are like headings,\nyou know some are interesting,\n\n101\n00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.435\nsome are straight, others italicize,\nthere's a whole range of fonts.\n\n102\n00:05:57.435 --> 00:05:59.660\nAnd you can explore as much as you want.\n\n103\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.907\nSo if I pick some text for\nexample and then I go, wow okay,\n\n104\n00:06:02.907 --> 00:06:05.570\nI wanna see how this font will look like.\n\n105\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.830\nLook, that looks really interesting.\n\n106\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.230\nSome are smaller, some give more space.\n\n107\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.710\nSo it really,\nreally depends on your taste.\n\n108\n00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.390\nBut at the time you have to\ncognizant of the fact that\n\n109\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.170\nyou're preparing this document for\nsomeone else to read.\n\n110\n00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.370\nYeah, you may be preparing for\n\n111\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.760\nyourself but, sometimes as you define\nthose forms you really must think about\n\n112\n00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.410\nthe experience that someone else is going\nto go through when they're reading it.\n\n113\n00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.170\nAll right, in addition to fonts\nthere's something we call style.\n\n114\n00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.870\nSee the style gives you an opportunity\nto determine what the entire document is\n\n115\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.930\ngoing to look like.\n\n116\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.335\nSo this section is about style.\n\n117\n00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:46.360\nNow sometimes it's not really very\nuseful to reinvent the wheel.\n\n118\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.180\nSome people have spent a lot\nof time thinking about how\n\n119\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.860\ncould a professional document look like,\nhow could a formal document look like,\n\n120\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.000\nhow could an elegant document look like?\n\n121\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.830\nSo some of these styles have been created\nwhich are templates that you can adopt and\n\n122\n00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.410\nthe entire document gets\nto have a certain style.\n\n123\n00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.840\nSo look at my document, the font here is\ntimes new roman, both for the title and\n\n124\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.870\nthe text.\n\n125\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.889\nNow if I go up to the right here on\nmy text and I have changed style, and\n\n126\n00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:18.703\nI click it and then I can see style set,\nnow there are several options of style,\n\n127\n00:07:18.703 --> 00:07:24.894\nthere's distinctive, elegant, fancy,\nnormal, manuscript, modern, etc.\n\n128\n00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:28.782\nSo as I click each of them,\nthe whole document seems to change and\n\n129\n00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.610\nhave a particular format.\n\n130\n00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.670\nSo the beautiful thing about this,\n\n131\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.070\npeople have spent a lot of time framing\nhow these styles are going to look like.\n\n132\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.830\nSo you could be easily just adopt\na document and maintain that style.\n\n133\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.050\nHow do you know if, Ronnie,\nthis has been a useful tool for you?\n\n134\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.559\n>> Yes, all these tools that\nyou've mentioned so far,\n\n135\n00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:47.915\nvery useful when we start\nworking inside of Word.\n\n136\n00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:52.254\nAnd a lot of times, even though we may\nbe creating the documents themselves,\n\n137\n00:07:52.254 --> 00:07:56.727\nwhat we normally find out when we we enter\nthe workplace is that we're not really\n\n138\n00:07:56.727 --> 00:08:01.470\nhaving to create the documents as much as\nactually opening up existing documents And\n\n139\n00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.318\nthen finding out that we need to\nadjust it in some way, and some how.\n\n140\n00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.753\nAnd so, learning about these tools and\nthese techniques here, about\n\n141\n00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:13.480\nthe editing of the text and realizing\nwhat needs to be done, is really helpful.\n\n142\n00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.070\nHelping us to see that show hide button\ncan really can help us if we actually\n\n143\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.540\ndo see something that is a little bit off,\nbut we're not exactly sure.\n\n144\n00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.310\nThe show/hide shows us the background\nmarks that may show you that there's\n\n145\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.760\nan extra space, or two spaces in there,\nthat you don't realize, or\n\n146\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.740\na paragraph that's actually been\ninserted in where you didn't want it.\n\n147\n00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.175\nAnd all you have to do is actually use\nthose marks to really help you out.\n\n148\n00:08:36.175 --> 00:08:41.015\nBeing able to change the styles themselves\nas well to help conform that document\n\n149\n00:08:41.015 --> 00:08:45.325\nto whatever the actual protocol,\nor the formatting style,\n\n150\n00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:49.742\nthat your company needs is gonna be\na very big help for you in the future.\n\n151\n00:08:49.742 --> 00:08:52.792\nBecause if not, what ends up\nhappening is that you're documents,\n\n152\n00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:56.532\neven though they may be technically\ncorrect, they don't match up so\n\n153\n00:08:56.532 --> 00:08:59.312\nthat when they collate them\ntogether with other people's work,\n\n154\n00:08:59.312 --> 00:09:02.542\nthey don't seem like a unified\nset of work that comes together.\n\n155\n00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.892\nSo, understanding the use of these\nstyles is also very important, and\n\n156\n00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:09.160\nwhat we can actually see\nthere really helps out.\n\n157\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.720\nSo, when you start talking about\nusing these kinds of tools and\n\n158\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.620\ntechniques, it really\nis about productivity.\n\n159\n00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.902\nYou can do every single\none of them manually,\n\n160\n00:09:17.902 --> 00:09:21.505\nbut the styles help you to be able to\nuse those preset formatting tools to\n\n161\n00:09:21.505 --> 00:09:25.829\nallow you to adjust it to the same format,\nhopefully, that everybody else is using,\n\n162\n00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:29.614\nwithout you having to go back in and\nfigure out did I change this correctly,\n\n163\n00:09:29.614 --> 00:09:31.295\ndid I create the right font size,\n\n164\n00:09:31.295 --> 00:09:34.155\ndid I actually have the right color for\nthese headings.\n\n165\n00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:36.164\nIt really is a very helpful measure, and\n\n166\n00:09:36.164 --> 00:09:39.930\nWord is one of the most popular tools\nthat you're gonna end up using.\n\n167\n00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.820\nSo, you definitely wanna make\nsure that you pay attention here,\n\n168\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.500\nif you're really getting into the idea of\nworking inside of an office, and you know\n\n169\n00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.960\nthat one of the big things they're gonna\nrequire you to do is have knowledge or\n\n170\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.960\nhave a little bit of experience in word\nprocessing as well as in working in Word.\n\n171\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.750\n>> Great, so what we're gonna do\nnow is we'll summarize a little bit\n\n172\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.550\non some of the features\nthat already exist for\n\n173\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.167\npurposes of formatting the text\n>> So,\n\n174\n00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:07.840\nwe've already given you a hint right now.\n\n175\n00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.690\nIf you look at, back of this section,\n\n176\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.480\nwhere you were talking about font,\nthere are many other things over there.\n\n177\n00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.590\nYou can underline text.\n\n178\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.340\nSo, if I select some text here,\nI can underline it.\n\n179\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.040\nIf I want my title to be Italicized,\nI can Italicize it.\n\n180\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.720\nI can increase the font over here.\n\n181\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.090\nReduce the font.\n\n182\n00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:32.280\nDetermine the font size\nI can change the color.\n\n183\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.540\nI can give some effect to my text.\n\n184\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.600\nI thought that's a really cool one,\ncuz I can get some text, and\n\n185\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.880\nit kind of looks now\na little more interesting.\n\n186\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.400\nWow, okay.\n\n187\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.120\nLook at that now.\n\n188\n00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.890\nOkay.\nSomehow it may look like,\n\n189\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.010\nmaybe not very visible.\n\n190\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.120\nI can change it.\n\n191\n00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.260\nWhatever you want, you can play around\nwith all these features of font.\n\n192\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.793\nAnd one more thing that is interesting\nis that you can actually expand and\n\n193\n00:10:53.793 --> 00:10:57.445\nlook at other elements of this\nfont in a more friendly way.\n\n194\n00:10:57.445 --> 00:11:02.423\nSo, if I click this I have\na lot more about fonts.\n\n195\n00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:06.712\nI can now check, well,\nthey uppercase, lowercase.\n\n196\n00:11:06.712 --> 00:11:08.460\nI can underline.\n\n197\n00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.080\nI can make something superscript,\nsubscript, or whatever it'll be.\n\n198\n00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.600\nSo, this prompt here, gives me\nan opportunity to do a lot more things.\n\n199\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.890\nAnd so, look, the best way to\ndo this is to do it yourself.\n\n200\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.320\nSo, at least we've pointed\nyou to the direction, and\n\n201\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.660\nyou can take time, and dig deeper,\nplay around with all that elemental font.\n\n202\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.390\nLook at existing documents that\nhave been done by other people, and\n\n203\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.950\nyou'll see very interesting reports,\nvery nice documents online,\n\n204\n00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.148\nand then you can try to do\nsame thing to your document.\n\n205\n00:11:39.148 --> 00:11:42.390\nSo, don't be limited by\nyour own creativity.\n\n206\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.750\nYou can pick from what some other people\nhave done, and write on that as well.\n\n207\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.700\nSo, with all those features,\nthinking about upper case,\n\n208\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.980\nlower case, resizing text,\nand all that stuff.\n\n209\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.230\nI'm sure, that's a useful tool.\n\n210\n00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.825\n>> It absolutely is one of the best things\nthat you can actually learn how to do\n\n211\n00:11:59.825 --> 00:12:03.145\nbecause it gives you that ability\nto control everything about that\n\n212\n00:12:03.145 --> 00:12:06.035\ntext that you've selected,\nright then and there.\n\n213\n00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:09.925\nRealize how many tools that you can use\njust to actually affect a single word or\n\n214\n00:12:09.925 --> 00:12:13.192\nsingle letter that has showed us here.\n\n215\n00:12:13.192 --> 00:12:17.342\nIt really is helpful for us to be able\nto do that when we need to adjust it to\n\n216\n00:12:17.342 --> 00:12:21.122\ngive us the proper\nemphasis that we need to,\n\n217\n00:12:21.122 --> 00:12:26.032\nor maybe even to make it offset a little\nbit, the way that somebody is describing.\n\n218\n00:12:26.032 --> 00:12:28.632\nA lot of times when we're working\nthis side of Word, it's not so\n\n219\n00:12:28.632 --> 00:12:31.830\nmuch that we get all the words\nonto the document, that someone,\n\n220\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:36.190\nlet's say our supervisor,\ncomes along and says that's exactly what\n\n221\n00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.792\nI wanted to see in terms of the text,\nbut it's not standing out enough.\n\n222\n00:12:40.792 --> 00:12:44.930\nWell, has showed us some of\nthe different techniques that we can use\n\n223\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.130\nto help it stand out, whether it's adding\nin a text effect or just making it bold or\n\n224\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:54.160\nchanging the font size, a lot of these\nare the background tools that we would use\n\n225\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.970\nto help us to adjust and\nto make it make the impact that we need.\n\n226\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.110\nAnd that's really what the idea\nof the document is about.\n\n227\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.910\nIf you just read words after\nwords after words, paragraph\n\n228\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.380\nafter paragraph after paragraph, in a book\nor in a novel, that's perfectly fine.\n\n229\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:13.410\nBut when you're doing this for an idea\nof some type of workload that you have,\n\n230\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.170\nor work process, and you need to make the\nimpact that your department is doing what\n\n231\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.800\nit needs to do, you wanna set those\nthings off a little bit in your document.\n\n232\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.400\nUsing these techniques is\ndefinitely gonna help you out, and\n\n233\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.770\nit's something that you definitely\nwant to make sure that you understand.\n\n234\n00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.174\nSo, in the way he said it, go ahead and\npractice those, take words,\n\n235\n00:13:30.174 --> 00:13:33.934\ntake paragraphs, be able to actually\nshow what you can do to manipulate it so\n\n236\n00:13:33.934 --> 00:13:37.990\nthat you can actually give the result that\nsomebody's asking you to give with that\n\n237\n00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.628\ndocument.\n\n238\n00:13:38.628 --> 00:13:40.378\n>> Great.\n\n239\n00:13:40.378 --> 00:13:43.903\nNow, along the same lines\nof working with paragraphs,\n\n240\n00:13:43.903 --> 00:13:47.320\nyou can create things in bullet format.\n\n241\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.220\nYou can easily increase\nthe space between lines.\n\n242\n00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.830\nAnd so, there are many other things\nyou can do with a paragraph.\n\n243\n00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.200\nNow, next to the section\nthat talks about font,\n\n244\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.430\nwe have another section\nthat deals with paragraphs.\n\n245\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.300\nSo, there's certain things you\ncan do with the paragraph.\n\n246\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.226\nIf I select all my text here,\nit look like it's really balanced,\n\n247\n00:14:07.226 --> 00:14:09.730\nkind of like a rectangle.\n\n248\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.480\nBut there are ways of\norganizing that text.\n\n249\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.330\nWe can make it right aligned.\n\n250\n00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.880\nWe can make it left aligned.\n\n251\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.695\nWe can make it center aligned.\n\n252\n00:14:17.695 --> 00:14:21.000\nThere are different times when you\nneed text to be organized that way.\n\n253\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.020\nSo, you might wonder why would\nI want to do text like that?\n\n254\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.300\nThere comes a time where you probably want\nto organize something along those lines.\n\n255\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.652\nMaybe you're interested in organizing\nsomething in bullet points.\n\n256\n00:14:32.652 --> 00:14:36.780\nSo, I say, well, I've explained something,\nand I want to give you an idea.\n\n257\n00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.810\nSo, I say this point one,\nand this points two.\n\n258\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.900\nAnd maybe this point three.\n\n259\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:48.070\nSo, how are we gonna arrange this so\nthat it's easy to read and understandable?\n\n260\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.940\nI can make it in bullet point.\n\n261\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.975\nSo, I can select the entire text,\nand I click bullet.\n\n262\n00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:55.078\nIt just organizes it for me.\n\n263\n00:14:55.078 --> 00:14:57.610\nOr I want it in number form.\n\n264\n00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.680\nThere you go, number 1,2,3.\n\n265\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.310\nBut what if I wanted a, b, c?\n\n266\n00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.781\nAnd I can select over here, and\n\n267\n00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:06.662\nthen I have several options of how I\ncould possibly organize that text.\n\n268\n00:15:06.662 --> 00:15:10.530\nAnd so, there is the beauty of how you\ncould play around with a paragraph to make\n\n269\n00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.290\nit easy to read and interesting to follow.\n\n270\n00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.970\nJust the way the mind is organized,\nwhen you are listing things for me,\n\n271\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:22.800\nI'd really want them to be in a list form,\nas opposed to be in a paragraph section.\n\n272\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.510\nSo, you need to keep thinking about what\nwill be the experience of the user who is\n\n273\n00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.280\ngoing to read your document.\n\n274\n00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.550\nHow this is going to, for\nthem to understand, to flow, and so\n\n275\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.700\nthey enjoy what they're reading?\n\n276\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.590\nSo, you use these tools in order to make\nyour work a little easy to go through.\n\n277\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.880\nSo, let me also create another small\nfeature here, in my paragraph.\n\n278\n00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.150\nSo, I'm gonna select this paragraph.\n\n279\n00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:49.109\nAnd then, I'm gonna say, well, I want\nto do the line spacing a little bit.\n\n280\n00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:52.170\nMaybe because there is some\nelement of interest, or\n\n281\n00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.422\nmaybe I want this paragraph to occupy\na much larger space in my document.\n\n282\n00:15:56.422 --> 00:16:01.215\nSo, I select the entire paragraph,\nand then I go to line spacing.\n\n283\n00:16:01.215 --> 00:16:06.000\nLine spacing, you say well,\nI wanna do 2.0, and there we go.\n\n284\n00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.095\nWe can call it 2.0 for that matter, and\nit's occupying a much larger space.\n\n285\n00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:13.640\nFor people in universities, I have seen\nthis in a number of instances where\n\n286\n00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.290\nthe thesis or the report that they write\nis expected to follow a certain format.\n\n287\n00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.900\nThey would easily say we want\nthe spacing to be 2.0, or\n\n288\n00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.610\nthey would want 1.0, or\n1.5, for that matter.\n\n289\n00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.720\nSo you need to know how would you do that.\n\n290\n00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:34.504\nSo here is a feature that enables you to\nincrease the line spacing between words,\n\n291\n00:16:34.504 --> 00:16:39.917\nand then make it left align,\njustified, or right align, etc.\n\n292\n00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:47.792\nIn addition to that, you have\nan opportunity also to increase the tabs.\n\n293\n00:16:47.792 --> 00:16:49.559\nNow just before I go the tabs,\n\n294\n00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:52.955\nI did mention that when you\nare listing things like that,\n\n295\n00:16:52.955 --> 00:16:57.929\nit's possible you may have some elements\nthat are sub elements of the current one.\n\n296\n00:16:57.929 --> 00:17:02.160\nSo lets hit Point 1,\nwe're supposed to have Point 2 as well.\n\n297\n00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.537\nWe also have two points within itself, so\nif I click Enter at the end of Point 1,\n\n298\n00:17:07.537 --> 00:17:11.735\nit gives me an opportunity\nautomatically to insert Point 2.\n\n299\n00:17:11.735 --> 00:17:15.161\nBut let's say that Point\n1 had two elements in it.\n\n300\n00:17:15.161 --> 00:17:20.024\nIf I click the tab, it enables me\nto move to the right a little, and\n\n301\n00:17:20.024 --> 00:17:24.278\nthen restore the third one to\nbecome now Point number 2.\n\n302\n00:17:24.278 --> 00:17:30.212\nSo I can say Sub 1 here, and then I Enter,\nand this is Sub 2, so there you go.\n\n303\n00:17:30.212 --> 00:17:33.747\nI actually have two\nelements within Point 1, so\n\n304\n00:17:33.747 --> 00:17:37.812\nthat is the power of tabbing,\nthis is the tab sign here.\n\n305\n00:17:37.812 --> 00:17:41.653\nThat enables you to move text to\nthe right a little bit and then retain.\n\n306\n00:17:41.653 --> 00:17:45.726\nNow if I do tab, I do Shift+tab,\nthat means it takes me back.\n\n307\n00:17:45.726 --> 00:17:51.413\nThat's like a reverse instruction,\nit takes me back to where I was.\n\n308\n00:17:51.413 --> 00:18:00.079\nJust a minute, Sub 1, I can go back\nhere and tack it back to where it was.\n\n309\n00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.965\nSo you can easily use tab\nto move to the right and\n\n310\n00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:05.481\nthen Shift+tab to move to the left, and\n\n311\n00:18:05.481 --> 00:18:09.706\nthen it automatically organizes\nthe text for you, So there you go.\n\n312\n00:18:09.706 --> 00:18:15.320\nWhat if you wanted to move the entire\nparagraph a little bit to the right?\n\n313\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.340\nThat can be a reason,\nif you tab, the text is moving.\n\n314\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.360\nSo if they select the entire text,\ntab, the entire paragraph is moving.\n\n315\n00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.480\nTab again, and if I do Shift+tab,\nit goes back the way it was.\n\n316\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.830\nSo these are some of the features that\nyou can use to manipulate your paragraph,\n\n317\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.240\nmake it a little more interesting,\n\n318\n00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.220\ngive it a better visual arrangement,\nand people will enjoy reading.\n\n319\n00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.470\nIs that true Ronald?\n\n320\n00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.390\n>> It definitely is,\nthe idea here is fairly simple.\n\n321\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.200\nWhen you just have all that text jumbled\nup, whether it's two paragraphs or\n\n322\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.752\nwhether it's ten paragraphs, and you only\nhave line after line after line at that\n\n323\n00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:52.030\n1.0 setting, your eyes will begin to\nblur a little bit as people read.\n\n324\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.690\nBy setting it off,\nby increasing those lines in between,\n\n325\n00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.630\nit allows them to visually be able to\nfollow that and actually understand, that\n\n326\n00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.580\neven though you're actually separating it\nout, it makes it easier for them to read.\n\n327\n00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.130\nThe other thing here,\nis the idea of using bullet points, and\n\n328\n00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.270\nof course,\neven numbered points to help you out.\n\n329\n00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.440\nAnd this is one of the most\neffective features that you can use\n\n330\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.540\nto emphasize the points that we need\nto emphasize inside of our documents.\n\n331\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.011\nA lot of times those bullet points,\nin deciding what to actually put in there,\n\n332\n00:19:22.011 --> 00:19:25.127\nis that if you actually use\na bullet point like what Dr.\n\n333\n00:19:25.127 --> 00:19:29.102\nTonny showed us, with just\na simple dot of some sort, right?\n\n334\n00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:32.700\nWhat you're saying is that it doesn't\nmatter in the order in the list that you\n\n335\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.860\ncreate, you just wanted to\nemphasize those points.\n\n336\n00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.352\nBut if you choose a numbered point,\njust like the way that our minds think,\n\n337\n00:19:39.352 --> 00:19:43.250\nwe always emphasize the idea of that\nthere's an importance in the order.\n\n338\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.800\nSo choosing whichever one that you\nwant to is actually the idea there\n\n339\n00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.800\nin understanding that.\n\n340\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.700\nIf you have a numbered list,\n\n341\n00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.090\nyou're saying that there's\nan order of importance in this.\n\n342\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.777\nIf you have an un-numbered one, you're\ntrying to give them equal amount, or\n\n343\n00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:58.070\nequal level of importance instead.\n\n344\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.990\nBut you don't have any great\nway to show that equality,\n\n345\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.490\nexcept by making\nthe bullet point the same.\n\n346\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.020\nHaving that done and\noff setting it makes it very\n\n347\n00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.632\nvisually appealing inside of a paragraph,\ninside of your document.\n\n348\n00:20:09.632 --> 00:20:13.270\nAnd it also draws the eye to it,\nand that's really the key.\n\n349\n00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.560\nRemember that a lot of times what\nwe're showing you right now,\n\n350\n00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.520\nall right, is not just the idea of\ncreating the document, but the idea here\n\n351\n00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.520\nof understanding that the documents that\nyou work with may give you everything that\n\n352\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.210\nyou need to understand about whatever\npoint you're trying to make.\n\n353\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.070\nBut what we're trying to do is to show\nyou how to make it more effective\n\n354\n00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.550\nby adding in these\nparticular elements to it.\n\n355\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.448\nAnd that's why these things\nare important in what we are doing.\n\n356\n00:20:34.448 --> 00:20:37.511\nSo what else do we actually need\nto take a look at here Dr. Tonny?\n\n357\n00:20:37.511 --> 00:20:39.023\n>> There are more interesting things,\n\n358\n00:20:39.023 --> 00:20:41.664\nI mean I'm sure you have seen\nthe value of what we are doing here.\n\n359\n00:20:41.664 --> 00:20:44.677\nNow sometimes you want to create titles,\nand\n\n360\n00:20:44.677 --> 00:20:50.590\nyou want the titles to be using existing\nformats that already have been designed.\n\n361\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.520\nAnd so all you would need to do, is you\nneed to understand sections or formats.\n\n362\n00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.920\nIf you look at Style,\nwe spoke a little bit about Style, and\n\n363\n00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.920\nwe selected different Styles over here.\n\n364\n00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.418\nBut there is also an opportunity to\nquickly pick a style without having to\n\n365\n00:21:05.418 --> 00:21:08.790\nstruggle, trying to imagine,\nhow would it possibly look like?\n\n366\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.232\nSo what Microsoft Word has done,\n\n367\n00:21:10.232 --> 00:21:12.766\nis that they've actually put\nthe various Styles up here.\n\n368\n00:21:12.766 --> 00:21:16.351\nSo just by pointing at them,\nyou quickly identify,\n\n369\n00:21:16.351 --> 00:21:19.941\nwhoa this is what my text\nwill ultimately look like.\n\n370\n00:21:19.941 --> 00:21:24.810\nSo let me select My title, and\nthen I quickly go up here.\n\n371\n00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:32.470\nI see an option, Normal, No Spacing,\nHeading 1, Heading 2, Title, Subtitle.\n\n372\n00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.410\nAs you can see, my title is changing.\n\n373\n00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.260\nSo let me pick title 1.\n\n374\n00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.510\nThe reason why I want us to go through\nthis section is because it's leading us\n\n375\n00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:44.070\nto another section of how we could\norganize things in specific pages, and\n\n376\n00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.530\ncreate breaks in pages, so that we\ncan have titles in different pages.\n\n377\n00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.930\nTypically, if you're working on a report,\nchances are very high that\n\n378\n00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:56.000\nevery major report will start at\nthe top of a page, that's very typical.\n\n379\n00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.130\nSo what if your text,\ntowards the end of the first topic or\n\n380\n00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.375\nchapter, is somewhere right\nin the middle of a document?\n\n381\n00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:07.460\nSo chances are that you create a mechanism\nthat sends you to the next page, so\n\n382\n00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.000\nthat you can begin right\nat the top of the document.\n\n383\n00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.313\nSo there we go, I have a title,\nMy title, so I'll call it My title 1.\n\n384\n00:22:14.313 --> 00:22:19.330\nSo I've selected that, as you can see\nup here, it is of Heading 1 type.\n\n385\n00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.610\nIf I click my text,\nit tells me that this is Normal.\n\n386\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:28.080\nSo let's say, that towards the end,\nI have finished my work.\n\n387\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:34.910\nAnd then I say, well somewhere here, I'm\ngonna remove this indicator for paragraph.\n\n388\n00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:40.381\nSo I'm gonna say now over here,\nI want to go to Title 2, okay?\n\n389\n00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:45.319\nSo now I have an option, I could very\neasily enter tab, Enter, Enter, Enter,\n\n390\n00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:47.248\nuntil it goes to the next page.\n\n391\n00:22:47.248 --> 00:22:51.109\nThe problem with that, is that sometimes\nyou're going to lose formatting.\n\n392\n00:22:51.109 --> 00:22:55.113\nAnd it's gonna catch up with you,\nespecially when you move things later on,\n\n393\n00:22:55.113 --> 00:22:57.010\nand things start moving.\n\n394\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.850\nSo you can create a rule,\nand say that I want\n\n395\n00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:05.170\nTitle 2 to always be at the beginning of a\npage, irrespective of what's gonna happen.\n\n396\n00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:09.800\nSo as I type things out, if I want to just\nhave a few more things on this section,\n\n397\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.770\nI want always this Title 2 to\nbe at a beginning of a new page.\n\n398\n00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.027\nSo if things spill into\nthe next page as I type,\n\n399\n00:23:17.027 --> 00:23:20.150\nI want this now to jump to the third page.\n\n400\n00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.160\nSo let me remove this and\nshow you exactly how we're gonna do that.\n\n401\n00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.900\nSo let's take the cursor right\nat the beginning of the Title 2,\n\n402\n00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.980\nand I go to Insert and I say Page Break.\n\n403\n00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.752\nNow that takes me to a new page.\n\n404\n00:23:36.752 --> 00:23:40.070\nAnd then what I'm going to do now,\nis that I'll select my title, and\n\n405\n00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.900\nI'll go back Home, and\nI'll make it Heading 1.\n\n406\n00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.950\nSo it means now we have two Heading 1s.\n\n407\n00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.520\nWe have the first one that we worked with,\nand the second that we worked here.\n\n408\n00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.914\nNow later on you will see\nthe power of this kind of a tool.\n\n409\n00:23:52.914 --> 00:23:57.054\nFor example if you're creating table of\ncontents, you don't have to keep typing,\n\n410\n00:23:57.054 --> 00:24:00.920\ngo look for the text again, come here to\nthe table of contents Insert it again.\n\n411\n00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.925\nAnd you know.\nWhen things move around.\n\n412\n00:24:02.925 --> 00:24:05.430\nThen again, you're trying to figure\nout which page number was that now.\n\n413\n00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.630\nSo I can come and change.\n\n414\n00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.640\nYou can do all that automatically.\n\n415\n00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.590\nYou don't even have to worry\nabout table of contents.\n\n416\n00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:16.890\nThat is the power of the styles because\nthe document now becomes intelligent.\n\n417\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.030\nAnd it can easily make things so easy.\n\n418\n00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.940\nIf you want to clear table of figures,\nyou create table of content.\n\n419\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.880\nYou want to take like all the tables\nof actually having your document\n\n420\n00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.870\nwhere you've done any referencing.\n\n421\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.820\nThat can be done all\nautomatically if you use style.\n\n422\n00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.610\nSo this is an encouragement.\n\n423\n00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.440\nBut you need to understand how\nto use the styles because later\n\n424\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.310\nIt'll become a very powerful tool.\n\n425\n00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.260\nRonald, I learned a very\nsimple joke some time back.\n\n426\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:45.760\n>> Okay.\n\n427\n00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.040\n>> I was trying to learn\nhow to play tennis.\n\n428\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.350\nAnd I went and bought a racket.\n\n429\n00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.430\nBut I bought some kind of old racket.\n\n430\n00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.060\nWhich was just kind of poor quality.\n\n431\n00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.800\nAnd then my friend came and\ntold me, why are you buying this?\n\n432\n00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.250\nWell I said look,\nI'm just learning some basics so far.\n\n433\n00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.430\nSo don't you worry, I'll be fine.\n\n434\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:02.900\nHe said no, no, no,\nno You should buy a good racket.\n\n435\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.310\nI said, well I don't think so.\n\n436\n00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.310\nSo I went and bought it anyway.\n\n437\n00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.540\nAnd then I played with it for some time.\n\n438\n00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.140\nI never got professional training.\n\n439\n00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.610\nSo one day, when I was getting courageous.\n\n440\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.650\nHow to hit that ball, I actually hit it so\nhard the racquet broke.\n\n441\n00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.090\nAnd someone who was a professional\ntrainer came to me and told me.\n\n442\n00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.250\nTony, let me tell you\nthe mistake you made.\n\n443\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:27.520\nYou bought the wrong racquet.\n\n444\n00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.324\nAnd number two,\nyou refuse to pay to be taught.\n\n445\n00:25:31.324 --> 00:25:33.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now here's what I'm going to do.\n\n446\n00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.620\nHe said I'll charge you to teach you\n\n447\n00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.050\nto unlearn the bad habits you've already\npicked while trying to learn tennis.\n\n448\n00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.870\nAnd secondly, I'm going to\nteach you how to read properly.\n\n449\n00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.350\nNow that means now you're\ngoing to pay twice, all right?\n\n450\n00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.720\nAnd then you have to go and get\nthe right racket for this kind of work.\n\n451\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.668\nSo the reason I'm giving\nthat illustration.\n\n452\n00:25:52.668 --> 00:25:57.120\nIs that getting some of these right habits\non how to use Microsoft One, oddly enough,\n\n453\n00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.080\nwill make your life much easier later.\n\n454\n00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.680\nIt might look like\na little bit challenging.\n\n455\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.580\nOr okay,\nwhy don't I just do the easy way out?\n\n456\n00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.890\nBut just learning some of these habits\nwill make life much lighter later.\n\n457\n00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:08.850\nIsn't that true Ronald?\n\n458\n00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:12.480\n>> There is no doubt that the idea of\ngetting some of these foundational skills\n\n459\n00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.820\ndown really helps.\n\n460\n00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.890\nInstead of you trying\nto muddle through it.\n\n461\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.630\nSo learning the techniques here\nare really going to be a tremendous help.\n\n462\n00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.620\nNow what we've done so far, right.\n\n463\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.110\nHas kind of helped us\nin two different ways.\n\n464\n00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.850\nWe've showed you how to work essentially\nwith the idea of selecting the text.\n\n465\n00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.860\nAnd even paragraphs a little bit.\n\n466\n00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.600\nBut these last couple of tools that Dr.\nTommy talked about.\n\n467\n00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.640\nEspecially the idea of the styles here\nreality helps us to work with large,\n\n468\n00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.260\nlarge documents.\n\n469\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.530\nWhether we're talking about the thesis\nof some sort at University level.\n\n470\n00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.240\nOr whether that we're\ntalking about you working and\n\n471\n00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.790\ncollaborating with multiple\ndifferent people in the department.\n\n472\n00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.490\nA lot of times those kinds\nof reports are collated and\n\n473\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.900\ngathered together into one document.\n\n474\n00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.270\nAnd it may be your\nresponsibility to be able to,\n\n475\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.970\nwell, essentially take those documents and\nmake them work together.\n\n476\n00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:04.810\nUsing styles ahead of time and getting\neverybody to use styles ahead of time\n\n477\n00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:09.150\nis really going to help in that adjustment\nas things actually merge together.\n\n478\n00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.640\nWithout you having to go and\nindividually take every single document.\n\n479\n00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.110\nAnd go, I have to actually\nreformat the entire document.\n\n480\n00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.620\nSo by learning that technique right\nat the beginning, it helps you out.\n\n481\n00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.770\nInstead of you learning it after five or\nsix times of doing it a manual way.\n\n482\n00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.850\nSo that's what we're trying to do,\n\n483\n00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:29.010\nis show you that this particular tool\ngives you that ability to be productive.\n\n484\n00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.420\nRegardless of the size of the document.\n\n485\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.660\nAs well by using these styles and\nthese techniques.\n\n486\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.350\nSo you are actually getting\na lot of information.\n\n487\n00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.720\nAnd the great thing is,\ninstead of you trying to go,\n\n488\n00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.480\nI wish I would of known that two months.\n\n489\n00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.320\nWell you're getting it right now.\n\n490\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.010\nSo that's what we're actually trying\nto do and trying to emphasize as well.\n\n491\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.420\nSo Dr.\nTawny what else do we need to see here?\n\n492\n00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.870\n>> All right.\nSo, for a few minutes.\n\n493\n00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.660\nBecause we need to close\nthis particular episode.\n\n494\n00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:58.870\nWe'll talk about changing\nthis tile of a page.\n\n495\n00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:00.830\nOrientation is something.\n\n496\n00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.910\nSometimes you find a document\nthat is kind of like horizontal.\n\n497\n00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.280\nAnd another one kind of\nlooks like it is vertical.\n\n498\n00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.400\nSo that's called orientation.\n\n499\n00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.880\nOne is portrait, one is vertical.\n\n500\n00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.530\nAnd one is kind of like horizontal,\nwith a little landscape.\n\n501\n00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.340\nWhen you're printing,\n\n502\n00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.950\nthat becomes useful depending on\nthe kind of content that you have.\n\n503\n00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.380\nIf you have a table that\nhave several columns,\n\n504\n00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:26.910\nthat document ideally should be in\nan orientation that is landscape.\n\n505\n00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.280\nSo that's an important tool to know.\n\n506\n00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:35.680\nIf you look at my screen now, there's a\nsection up there a tab called page layout.\n\n507\n00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.150\nNow, on the page layout,\nthere are many things that we can learn.\n\n508\n00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.240\nBut let's just focus on that orientation.\n\n509\n00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.980\nWe spoke about page break earlier on,\nso we have two ways of doing it.\n\n510\n00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:49.170\nYou could do a page break using this set\nof options here, we just pick Page Break.\n\n511\n00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:54.410\nBut now, let's just talk about\nthat orientation of our page.\n\n512\n00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.010\nSo, in order for us to see.\n\n513\n00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:02.970\nLet me just try and resize this document\nso that you see three sheets on a page.\n\n514\n00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.300\nThere we go.\nOk, so this current is portrait.\n\n515\n00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.490\nIf I came here and select orientation and\n\n516\n00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.520\npick landscape,\nsee what happens to my document.\n\n517\n00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.650\nNow you see two pages,\ntwo sheets on the screen.\n\n518\n00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.070\nOf course I can reduce this farther and\nyou can see many more.\n\n519\n00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.400\nBut what has happened is automatically the\nentire document is actually been converted\n\n520\n00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.920\ninto landscape.\n\n521\n00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.090\nNow, sometimes you might say, well no.\n\n522\n00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:32.400\nI just wanted a particular page in\nthe entire document to become landscape.\n\n523\n00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.240\nWhile everything else is portrait.\n\n524\n00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:34.978\nWe'll come to that.\n\n525\n00:29:34.978 --> 00:29:39.120\nWe're going to have a very\ngood mix between bricks.\n\n526\n00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.190\nAnd conversion of landscape and portrait.\n\n527\n00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.060\nSo we'll come to that at the right time.\n\n528\n00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.082\nBut just to let you know, that's possible.\n\n529\n00:29:45.082 --> 00:29:50.020\nWe can have a mix of document, of pages,\nin different kinds of orientation.\n\n530\n00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.720\nHas that been useful in any way for\nyour kind of work?\n\n531\n00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.530\n>> Definitely, when you start seeing\nthat you have a lot of data and\n\n532\n00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:56.900\nyou need to offset something.\n\n533\n00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.830\nSo a lot of times.\n\n534\n00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:02.000\nWhat I normally use the idea of changing\nthe orientation of the page for,\n\n535\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.860\nis I have a table of data that\nI also need to include into\n\n536\n00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.746\nmy regular reporting of the data as well.\n\n537\n00:30:08.746 --> 00:30:11.110\nBy being able to actually\ncreate that table and\n\n538\n00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.750\nthe landscape, it may allow me to\nadd in one or two extra columns.\n\n539\n00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:19.080\nThat the regular portrait style of\na page would not have allowed me to do.\n\n540\n00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.230\nSo unless I decreased the size\nof my table to a point\n\n541\n00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.310\nwhere it almost became unreadable.\n\n542\n00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:29.160\nBy simply changing landscape in\none direction it really did help.\n\n543\n00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.950\nSome types of reports though, or\n\n544\n00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:35.340\nsome type of document that you may end up\ndoing, everything may be in landscape.\n\n545\n00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.930\nAnd that is because that document is\ndesigned to do something else for us.\n\n546\n00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:44.100\nA lot of time the idea of using\nstep by step process is changing\n\n547\n00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.290\nthe orientation to that\nlandscape process allows me.\n\n548\n00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.420\nThen to bind one edge and\ncreate a flip book.\n\n549\n00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.400\nThat allows me to also continue to read.\n\n550\n00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.790\nBut then actually have it\nflip over the page by page.\n\n551\n00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:00.670\nSo understanding what the overall outcome.\n\n552\n00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.760\nWhat that document is going to be is\nreally going help you decide whether you\n\n553\n00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.120\nchoose the idea of Portrait or landscape.\n\n554\n00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.210\nOr if you do have something like a table.\n\n555\n00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:14.140\nThat, when I tried to print this out,\nit only printed out four columns.\n\n556\n00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.980\nAnd then another two columns\non the following page.\n\n557\n00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.720\nChanging the orientation of that one page\nmay allow you to take that one table,\n\n558\n00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.790\nprint it out all on one page.\n\n559\n00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.060\nWithout it actually\nlooking like it's broken.\n\n560\n00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.850\nSo, I've actually used this quite often.\n\n561\n00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.470\nJust to try and\nmake my point the way that I needed to.\n\n562\n00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:33.930\nOr to keep a certain number of pages\ndown the way that we needed to as well.\n\n563\n00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.290\n>> Great.\nSo,\n\n564\n00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.580\nwe've covered some very reasonable ground.\n\n565\n00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:43.690\nWe've learned quite a bit about\nmanipulating text, paragraphs, forms.\n\n566\n00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.050\nThinking through orientation and the like.\n\n567\n00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.308\nSo in our next session.\n\n568\n00:31:47.308 --> 00:31:51.690\nwe're going to pick on\nissues about page number.\n\n569\n00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:52.970\nThinking about headers and\n\n570\n00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:57.000\nfooters, things that will\nconstantly be there in a document.\n\n571\n00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.100\nI have seen some people who have\ncreated a template of a document.\n\n572\n00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.460\nAnd every time they want anybody in\nthe organization to work on that document,\n\n573\n00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.420\non any document.\n\n574\n00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.000\nThey expect them to use that template.\n\n575\n00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.520\nSo they've already inserted\nthem the footers and headers.\n\n576\n00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.820\nSo that's exactly where\nwe'll pick up next time.\n\n577\n00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.010\nSo its been great, I really hope that\nyou picked a few lessons here and\n\n578\n00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.510\nthere that you can apply.\n\n579\n00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.790\nAnd then you become more and\nmore proficient.\n\n580\n00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.490\nAnd as time goes by,\nyour productivity goes high.\n\n581\n00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.240\nI really hope it's going\nto happen right now.\n\n582\n00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.220\n>> All right, it sounds like\na great place for a part two then.\n\n583\n00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:32.000\nSo remember that in this episode,\nwe did take a look at Microsoft word.\n\n584\n00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.420\nAnd some of the different things that we\ncan do to help us become more productive\n\n585\n00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.290\nas we are working with\nthe word product itself.\n\n586\n00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.520\nWell, great place to\nend these episode then.\n\n587\n00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.940\nSign off for ITproTV,\nI've been your host Ronny Wong.\n\n588\n00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.210\n>> And my name Doctor Tony.\n\n589\n00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:51.710\nIt's been great learning together with\nyou and with great company, over and out.\n\n590\n00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.767\n>> All right, stay tuned right

00:00:16.910\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.390\nyou're watching\nthe Computing Fundamentals IC3 show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.725\nWhere we are actually continuing\non on a part two introducing\n\n6\n00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.616\nourselves to Microsoft Word 2010.\n\n7\n00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:30.189\nNow we're ready take a look at\nseveral elements before and\n\n8\n00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.000\nsome we understand we have to do.\n\n9\n00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.901\nBut we are now continuing on and with us\nagain in the studio is Dr. Tonny Omwanza.\n\n10\n00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.700\nDr. Tonny, welcome back to our studios.\n\n11\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.690\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n12\n00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.110\nI am last looking forward\nto digging deeper.\n\n13\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.780\n>> Excellent.\n\n14\n00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.768\nSo when we start taking a log now,\n\n15\n00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:50.312\nwe're ready to talk some of those\ndifferent elements that really helps us to\n\n16\n00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:54.860\nmake our Word documents kind of be able\nto format and do the things I wanna do.\n\n17\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.540\nBut now as we continue to move forward,\n\n18\n00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.970\nwe're starting to see where we're\nstarting off with very small elements.\n\n19\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.820\nAnd now we're working towards\nwhat larger elements and\n\n20\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.450\nwe're now gonna take\na look at page numbers.\n\n21\n00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.910\nAnd this is normally done because we do\ntend to work with very large documents\n\n22\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.670\nat times, right?\n\n23\n00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.600\n>> That's very correct.\n\n24\n00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.280\nSometimes you work on a thesis.\n\n25\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.640\nWhen I was doing my PhD, I worked on\na document that was over 300 pages.\n\n26\n00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.710\n>> Wow.\n>> So you're gonna have a sense,\n\n27\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.325\nyou can look on page 37,\nsomething like this.\n\n28\n00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:25.810\nSo you got organize that\ndocument with page numbers and\n\n29\n00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.300\nthen when you work on the table of\ncontents, then you can relate very easily.\n\n30\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.260\nSo think about people working\non a whole large document like\n\n31\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.740\nwhat I'm holding over here for the IC3\ncertification Computing Fundamentals.\n\n32\n00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.490\nI don't know, it's like how many pages?\n\n33\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.945\n722.\n\n34\n00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:40.608\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n35\n00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:43.237\nyou better think about how you're\norganizing those page numbers.\n\n36\n00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:46.170\nSo let's spend a little bit\nof time starting right there.\n\n37\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.630\nNow on my screen,\n\n38\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.540\nI've opened a page that is very\nfamiliar with what we've been doing.\n\n39\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.980\nI just call it simple document,\ndocument two.\n\n40\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.350\nSee what I'm gonna do.\n\n41\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.410\nI'm gonna click somewhere\nat the top of the document.\n\n42\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.940\nI double-click over there.\n\n43\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.560\nWhen I double-click, some line come\nover here and it's written here Header.\n\n44\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.270\nIf I scroll down,\nwe already did the scrolling.\n\n45\n00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.200\nIf I come to the end of the document,\nI've got a Footer, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.560\nSo those have been automatically created,\nthey exist.\n\n47\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.160\nSo as long as you click there,\nthey're gonna show up.\n\n48\n00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.630\nAnd what has happened\nto the main document?\n\n49\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.480\nIt's kind of a little blurred now, so\nthe focus is not in the main document.\n\n50\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.850\nIt's on the header and the footer.\n\n51\n00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.770\nSo we're gonna spend a little bit of time\nthinking about what would I do without\n\n52\n00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.990\nheader and footer.\n\n53\n00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.600\nSo let's start by Insert and\n\n54\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.240\nthen go move all over the place and\nget to a place called Page Numbers.\n\n55\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.410\nIf I click Page Numbers, click that arrow.\n\n56\n00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.386\nIt gives me a menu.\n\n57\n00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:47.970\n[INAUDIBLE] top or bottom or\nsomething about page numbers here.\n\n58\n00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.240\nCurrent position, format of page\nnumbers and remove page numbers.\n\n59\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.180\nSo this menu gives you an option to\nplay around with where you wanna\n\n60\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.690\nput the page numbers.\n\n61\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.350\nWhat format do you want them to be?\n\n62\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.520\nThey can be at the top, at the bottom,\nright, left, they can be A, B, C, D or\n\n63\n00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.947\nthey can be one, two, three, four, five.\n\n64\n00:03:04.947 --> 00:03:08.382\nSo let's just take an example quickly,\nselect top of the page and\n\n65\n00:03:08.382 --> 00:03:12.870\nthen decide whether you want to do on\nthe left, in the middle or on the right.\n\n66\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.460\nMaybe this look like an interesting one,\nso I'm going to click this.\n\n67\n00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.990\nAnd then I come to the center\nof the document and\n\n68\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.080\nclick somewhere there,\nnow I have a page number.\n\n69\n00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.420\n1 page, well,\nthat looks interesting, right?\n\n70\n00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.318\nSo what do you think would have\nhappened to the next page, Ronnie?\n\n71\n00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:31.780\n>> Well, hopefully it's a header and\nit's actually doing it on every page.\n\n72\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.580\nWe should see where it turns to page two,\nI believe.\n\n73\n00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.138\n>> Uh-huh, so what basically has happened\nhere is that we have page numbers from\n\n74\n00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:40.321\npage one to the end.\n\n75\n00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:42.080\nThere are other things\nyou can do with that.\n\n76\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.260\nAssuming I want to change\nthe page number type.\n\n77\n00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.980\nSo let's say I go back to Insert and\n\n78\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.220\nthen I go to Page Number and\nthen I go to Format Page Numbers.\n\n79\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.894\nNow you see their number format is 1,\n2, 3.\n\n80\n00:03:54.894 --> 00:03:57.780\nIf I click this, I have different options.\n\n81\n00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.760\nMaybe I want Roman 1, 2, 3.\n\n82\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.750\nAnd I say okay, it automatically\nchanges all my page numbers.\n\n83\n00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.450\nThere are many other things\nI can do over there.\n\n84\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.310\nSo Page Number again,\nRemove Page Number, it's all gone.\n\n85\n00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.420\nSo on my header and footer I have\npower to do a number of things.\n\n86\n00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.110\nSo let me just take back the page numbers.\n\n87\n00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.037\nSo I'm gonna say okay, top of the page,\n\n88\n00:04:19.037 --> 00:04:23.270\ncenter and I have inserted Roman one,\ntwo, three.\n\n89\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.740\nThe power of that is\nthat in some books and\n\n90\n00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.820\nactually in thesis,\nyou will find a section of the book.\n\n91\n00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.270\nHas Roman one, two, three and\n\n92\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.510\nthen normally from the first chapter,\nwe start with page one, two, three.\n\n93\n00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.030\nSo that's why it is important to\nknow how to play around with this.\n\n94\n00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.750\nThese are mixed that we'll talk about\na little later when you want to do\n\n95\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.620\npage breaks and then different numbers.\n\n96\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.930\nIn other words, conceptually the document\nis a collection of documents.\n\n97\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.867\nSo the first part is\nnumbered Roman one to X and\n\n98\n00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:56.040\nthen the second part is\nnumbered one through whatever.\n\n99\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.550\nSo that can all be done and\n\n100\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.390\nit can be reflected automatically\nin the table of content.\n\n101\n00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.654\nSo there we go, we have page numbers.\n\n102\n00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:06.367\nSo let's say I want something\nto appear in the header and\n\n103\n00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:10.721\nfooter of every page,\njust like the page numbers are appearing.\n\n104\n00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.120\nI want something to appear on every page.\n\n105\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.000\nSo let me just type something here.\n\n106\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.180\nIf I say it's been great.\n\n107\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.730\nWell, that doesn't make a lot of sense but\njust check it out.\n\n108\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.940\nI go back to Home, I want to write a line,\nwe would have write a few things already.\n\n109\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.880\nWrite a line.\n\n110\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.040\nThe page number is right in the center and\n\n111\n00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.570\nthen I go click right in the middle of\nthe document and then I scroll down.\n\n112\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.726\nSee, already it's there on all pages,\nall right?\n\n113\n00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:41.530\nSo I want to believe that\nthis is a useful feature.\n\n114\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.420\nBecause if for example, I'm working\non a report for an organization and\n\n115\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.660\nthey want their logo to appear on\nevery single page, 300 page document.\n\n116\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.610\nHow would you just copy that logo and\ntry to paste it in every single page?\n\n117\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.140\nI don't think that's really smart.\n\n118\n00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.060\nThat's why Microsoft Word\ncreated this tool.\n\n119\n00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.070\nSo all you just need to do is set\nthe logo in one spot, Header or\n\n120\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.510\nfooter and you're done.\n\n121\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.500\nWe can also do something on the footer and\nit also appears on every single document.\n\n122\n00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.850\nThat's powerful, isn't it?\n\n123\n00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.870\n>> It really is a powerful way for\nus to make sure\n\n124\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.290\nespecially that when we start working\nwith larger amounts of documents.\n\n125\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.738\nNow, our larger pages.\n\n126\n00:06:19.738 --> 00:06:24.710\nNow Dr. Tonny used the example of his\nparticular dissertation to help us out.\n\n127\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.570\nBut we can understand\nthat within a company,\n\n128\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.190\nas we do bring documents together.\n\n129\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.400\nThat what we want of course, is the page\nnumber that extends all the way through\n\n130\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.190\nthose multiple documents we may\nwant to go ahead and put together.\n\n131\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.095\nBy making sure that everybody\ndoes it in the page headers,\n\n132\n00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:43.032\nwe can now unite those documents together\nas you actually learn how to do that.\n\n133\n00:06:43.032 --> 00:06:47.823\nAnd you can make that page header to\nbe the same throughout the entire\n\n134\n00:06:47.823 --> 00:06:49.017\norganization.\n\n135\n00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:50.390\nNow Dr. Tonny,\n\n136\n00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.520\nI've actually helped somebody by\nediting a book for them before.\n\n137\n00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.580\nAnd what they wanted was that ability\nto be able to say here's what I want,\n\n138\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.396\nI want the page numbers\nto appear on each page.\n\n139\n00:07:01.396 --> 00:07:04.430\nBut then we even have this ability to say\n\n140\n00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.510\nwhat he wanted was on the odd number pages\nfor the title of the book to appear.\n\n141\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.370\nBut then on the even numbered pages,\n\n142\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.670\nhe wanted the chapter title\nto actually appear as well.\n\n143\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.810\nSo you have a lot of flexibility\nhere to be able to say hey,\n\n144\n00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.900\nas you flip through here,\nyou know exactly what chapter you're in.\n\n145\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.350\nAnd then you can look\non the other page and\n\n146\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.030\nknow what the title of the book\nis going to be as well.\n\n147\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.800\nSo you have that ability and\n\n148\n00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.650\nthen with the page numbers, you can\nthen have things that are in sequence.\n\n149\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.660\nI would have hate to actually seen Dr.\nTonny’s dissertation without page numbers.\n\n150\n00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.120\nAnd all of a sudden you take 10 or\n\n151\n00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.560\n15 pages, you throw them up on the air,\nin the air and they all land.\n\n152\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.854\nAnd then try and\ngather them up and even though Dr.\n\n153\n00:07:45.854 --> 00:07:49.092\nTonnt wrote that, I think you would\neven have a challenging time.\n\n154\n00:07:49.092 --> 00:07:50.306\nWhat order does this come in?\n\n155\n00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:53.229\nBut by putting page numbers\non these larger documents,\n\n156\n00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:57.097\nit allows us to be able to go ahead and\nput them back in the proper sequence.\n\n157\n00:07:57.097 --> 00:07:59.784\nSo use of page numbers and headers here.\n\n158\n00:07:59.784 --> 00:08:04.280\nThe headers make it more efficient and\nmore productive for us to do it.\n\n159\n00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.736\nThe numbering itself and also whatever\nother information gives us the logical\n\n160\n00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:10.964\nability to put things back in order, or\n\n161\n00:08:10.964 --> 00:08:15.170\nto allow us to logically identify\nwhat that work element is about.\n\n162\n00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.650\nSo that's why we want to\nuse things like this.\n\n163\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.550\nWhether it appears in the page header or\n\n164\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.840\nthe page footer is all gonna depend on a\nlot of times, especially at the university\n\n165\n00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.110\nlevel, on a style guide that they may\nactually ask you to use to present that.\n\n166\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.670\nWhat goes where, they'll actually tell you\nwhat they actually want in what position.\n\n167\n00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.471\nBut inside of a company you may have to\nfollow whatever standard formatting that\n\n168\n00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:40.250\nthey're using that lets you\nknow what you'll put in a page\n\n169\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.935\nheader versus what you'll put\nin a page footer as well.\n\n170\n00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:46.949\nSo there's a lot of applications where\nyou'll see that this is gonna be stuff\n\n171\n00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:51.310\nthat they're gonna expect you to know\nhow to do, and to modify if necessary.\n\n172\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.026\nSo learning it right here is actually\na great place to begin, but there's a lot\n\n173\n00:08:55.026 --> 00:08:58.538\nmore details, just like I explained\nto you, that you can learn how to do.\n\n174\n00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.930\n>> Mm-hm, great, let's talk about\nsomething very interesting also.\n\n175\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.970\nSome people read Bibles.\n\n176\n00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.602\nAnd when you look at the Bible it's\nnormally organized in columns.\n\n177\n00:09:09.602 --> 00:09:14.140\nOn the same page you've got text\nin two different columns or more.\n\n178\n00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.570\nAnd sometimes we also have magazines and\nnewspapers that have columns.\n\n179\n00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.450\nHave you asked yourself,\nhow did someone organize that?\n\n180\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.580\nHere, we'll show you.\n\n181\n00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.700\nSo look at my screen,\nif I select some text now.\n\n182\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.370\nI say, well I would like this to\nbe two columns so when we read to\n\n183\n00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.250\nthe bottom there's some space there and\nthen you move to another column.\n\n184\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.050\nSo let's go to Page Layout tab and\n\n185\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.420\nthen that's where the orientation\nwas about page set up.\n\n186\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.700\nThere is something about columns.\n\n187\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.460\nSo if I click that, it gives me options.\n\n188\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.260\nYou can have one column, two columns,\nthree columns, left, right.\n\n189\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.170\nSo you have an option there.\n\n190\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.560\nSo let me just pick three columns.\n\n191\n00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.890\nMy text is already in three\ncolumns automatically.\n\n192\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.100\nWell, what if I wanted to manipulate\nthis space within, between the two or\n\n193\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.550\nthree paragraphs,\nI mean columns, for that matter.\n\n194\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.490\nSo I can come and click Columns and\nI go to More Columns.\n\n195\n00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.990\nIt gives me a few other options.\n\n196\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.370\nI could actually increase the number\nof columns and make them many.\n\n197\n00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.190\nFive, six, whatever number.\n\n198\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.800\nBut of course,\n\n199\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.600\nyou gotta be realistic as to how much\ntext can there be in a particular column.\n\n200\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.040\nSo let's say I wanna do three columns, and\n\n201\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.920\nI want to play around with\nthe space between the columns.\n\n202\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.160\nSo I can say well, the width of the column\nis gonna be something like two inches.\n\n203\n00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.702\nAnd then I reduce the space between and\nsay it's gonna be 0.1.\n\n204\n00:10:38.702 --> 00:10:42.020\nSo I can play around with that and\nthen I say boom, let me select.\n\n205\n00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.550\nSee, the text has actually moved.\n\n206\n00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:48.428\nSo I could basically work on an entire\ndocument and have it in different formats.\n\n207\n00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:53.753\nSo a page could have columns,\nanother one we're going to have images,\n\n208\n00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:56.338\nanother one probably has a table.\n\n209\n00:10:56.338 --> 00:11:00.050\nAnd so we're gonna go now into very\nspecific things just like I just\n\n210\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.840\nmentioned, tables and\nimages as we proceed.\n\n211\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.970\nI really do hope that this is\nan interesting feature that you can use.\n\n212\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.100\n>> This is really one of the great\nfeatures that actually helped you out in\n\n213\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.649\nWord to be very creative.\n\n214\n00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:16.207\nIn college, Dr. Tonny, I had a newsletter\nthat I actually created by using\n\n215\n00:11:16.207 --> 00:11:19.995\nsomething like Word, and\nI wanted it to look like a newspaper.\n\n216\n00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:22.074\nNow, they weren't, of course,\n\n217\n00:11:22.074 --> 00:11:26.850\nanything as far as the intellectual\nability of my writing at that point.\n\n218\n00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.880\nBut overall though, I really wanted it to\nlook like a regular newspaper would look.\n\n219\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.910\nAnd even though I only had\na regular printer with me, and\n\n220\n00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.250\nI had my word processing program\nlike Word here, to do that.\n\n221\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.960\nIt wasn't Word, Word 97 hadn't\neven come out yet at that point.\n\n222\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.374\nSo it was the most basic foundation\nword processing program, but\n\n223\n00:11:46.374 --> 00:11:51.269\nbeing able to actually create columns\nallowed me to make the flow of what I\n\n224\n00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:55.925\nwas doing, like the way that you\nwould normally see in a newspaper for\n\n225\n00:11:55.925 --> 00:11:59.241\na reader to be able to follow along and\ndo as well.\n\n226\n00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:03.786\nA lot of times we may emphasize that\ncolumn because we might be limited in\n\n227\n00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:06.361\nthe space that we have available to us and\n\n228\n00:12:06.361 --> 00:12:11.530\nwe need to jam more information in\nthe given amount of space that we have.\n\n229\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.850\nSo we may choose to go ahead and\ndo that, or\n\n230\n00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:18.750\nmaybe where we are quoting a particular\narticle, and we know that we\n\n231\n00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.080\ncan't just do it paragraph by paragraph,\nwe need to actually offset it somehow.\n\n232\n00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.770\nSo having those paragraphs or\n\n233\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.280\nthose columns in there will really\nhelp if you wanted to do that.\n\n234\n00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.500\nThis is really more about formatting, and\n\n235\n00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.950\nthe choice in which you\nactually are gonna do.\n\n236\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.350\nSo we tend to see it more in\nthe desktop publishing world\n\n237\n00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.450\nthan maybe in a formalized document\nlike a dissertation or a thesis.\n\n238\n00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.474\nBut it doesn't mean\nthat you can't have it,\n\n239\n00:12:42.474 --> 00:12:45.102\nbut you just have to actually\nbe very careful in its usage.\n\n240\n00:12:45.102 --> 00:12:49.169\nSo this is a very useful feature if you\nknow that you are gonna be working for\n\n241\n00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:52.777\na company that does want to publish\nsomething like a newspaper and\n\n242\n00:12:52.777 --> 00:12:56.342\nthey expect to see it in a columnar\nformat, this is the way to go.\n\n243\n00:12:56.342 --> 00:13:01.284\nSo very neat feature for us to actually\nthink about and to be able to use too.\n\n244\n00:13:01.284 --> 00:13:05.171\nNow along with that, Dr.\nTonny, we also want to be able to,\n\n245\n00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:09.440\nI'm assuming, add in images or\nworking with pictures.\n\n246\n00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.550\n>> Yes, now we're gonna insert things,\nthat a little more visual, and\n\n247\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.740\nnot just like basic paragraph.\n\n248\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:21.210\nSo I'm gonna try and start by\ndemonstrating inserting of a picture.\n\n249\n00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:25.270\nPictures are worth 1,000 words,\nso they say.\n\n250\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.770\nAnd having pictures in document,\nmake them interesting, make them lively.\n\n251\n00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:34.040\nYou can say so much in a picture,\nmore than you even imagined.\n\n252\n00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.930\nJust depends on how someone\nvisualizes that picture.\n\n253\n00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:42.190\nSo on my computer now,\nI have opened a new page which is my\n\n254\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:46.140\ntitle two, and my title is My Images.\n\n255\n00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.124\nSo we're gonna play around\nwith three types of images.\n\n256\n00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:55.580\nLet's go to Insert, and\nthen pick Illustration section over here.\n\n257\n00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.540\nYou can see there is Pictures,\nthere is Clip Art,\n\n258\n00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.205\nthere is Images, there is Smart Art,\nthere is Charts, there is Screenshot.\n\n259\n00:14:03.205 --> 00:14:06.146\nWow, so\nit means you can do almost anything here.\n\n260\n00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:10.117\nIf your phone has a camera I can\nactually take a photograph of myself and\n\n261\n00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:11.290\nput it here.\n\n262\n00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.600\nThat's not for today, that's for\nanother day, all right?\n\n263\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.900\nSo let's just insert a picture.\n\n264\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.810\nI click here and\n\n265\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.762\nall of a sudden, well I'm the one who just\npre-selected the pictures I want to load.\n\n266\n00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:26.180\nSo, whoa, I want to insert this\nvery nice picture, double click it.\n\n267\n00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.230\nAnd then all of a sudden I\nhave picture on the image.\n\n268\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.060\nNow look that really makes\nthat page look interesting.\n\n269\n00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.480\nAnd I can easily put text below it,\nand there we go.\n\n270\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.090\nI can resize, and\nI think we spoke about resizing before.\n\n271\n00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:41.190\nI just point right out the corner and\nI proportionately resize the image.\n\n272\n00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.630\nI could actually rotate the image.\n\n273\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.985\nRonnie, that's interesting.\n\n274\n00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:48.400\nSo if you click on this\ngreen button over here, and\n\n275\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.910\nthen move to the right or\nto the left you actually rotate the image.\n\n276\n00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:59.228\nSo I'm gonna try and center align this,\nCtrl+E, well we'll talk about that later.\n\n277\n00:14:59.228 --> 00:15:04.730\nCtrl+ E centers the whole image and then\nI can rotate that image to some angle.\n\n278\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.740\nWell, that looks interesting,\nI don't know how cool it is,\n\n279\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.480\nbut one worked on a magazine sometime.\n\n280\n00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.480\nSo I've seen young people get excited\nabout images that are upside down and\n\n281\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.280\na different angle.\n\n282\n00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.830\nSo you can make something really,\nreally cool, isn't it?\n\n283\n00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.900\n>> It really is, yeah.\n\n284\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.660\nIt's one of those things\nthat allow you to adjust\n\n285\n00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.390\nit just to offset it a little bit where as\nwhat you're expecting to see as a series.\n\n286\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.882\nBy just kind of tilting it just\na little bit off to the corner,\n\n287\n00:15:29.882 --> 00:15:34.011\nor making it actually kind of even\nvertical in the way that we want it to.\n\n288\n00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:37.510\nIt may draw the eye to it, and\nthat's pretty much the idea.\n\n289\n00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.795\nAnd a lot of times, especially inside of\nWord, and this is probably not something\n\n290\n00:15:41.795 --> 00:15:45.210\nthat we will be talking about in\nthis particular series here, but\n\n291\n00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.337\nwe can even have the words flow\naround that image, as well.\n\n292\n00:15:48.337 --> 00:15:51.426\nAs that picture is just like you\ntyped an entire paragraph, and\n\n293\n00:15:51.426 --> 00:15:55.058\nyou put the picture in there and\nthe words automatically float around it.\n\n294\n00:15:55.058 --> 00:15:57.795\nYou can do that just\nlike a magazine would do.\n\n295\n00:15:57.795 --> 00:16:01.297\nAnd that's why Word is not only\na great word processor, but\n\n296\n00:16:01.297 --> 00:16:04.743\nwe also talked about the term\ndesktop publishing before.\n\n297\n00:16:04.743 --> 00:16:07.696\nIt allows you be able add in and\ninsert things like that.\n\n298\n00:16:07.696 --> 00:16:12.610\nAnd really create a very stylized type of\ndocument that will actually help you out\n\n299\n00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.520\nin whatever you want to create.\n\n300\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.870\n>> Great, now along the same lines,\nyou can insert many other things.\n\n301\n00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.450\nYou can insert an image,\nthat's a photo that is already existing.\n\n302\n00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.420\nWe can do clip art,\nwhich is basically a collection of\n\n303\n00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.840\nimages that have been created by Microsoft\nWord and already exist in the library.\n\n304\n00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.380\nYou can pick a shape,\nI just inserted this circular shape there,\n\n305\n00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.580\nyou can insert a rectangular shape.\n\n306\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.920\nAnd you can even write inside that image\nand say I want to add text, triangle.\n\n307\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.020\nWhen did I go back to school\nto check the spelling?\n\n308\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.120\nSo there you go I have triangle.\n\n309\n00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:58.460\nI could very easily insert text, I could\ninsert a title for that particular image.\n\n310\n00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:04.500\nSo if I go right click here, I can insert\ncaption and say well smiling or laughing.\n\n311\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.370\nSo there I can play with images.\n\n312\n00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:12.290\nSo images are powerful and\nthey can make a document very interesting.\n\n313\n00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.550\nI don't know if Ronald you've walked\nthrough any of these other types of\n\n314\n00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.860\nimages other than just a typical photo.\n\n315\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.570\n>> Well yes I have and that's\nbecause it is very important that we\n\n316\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.050\ndistinguish just a couple of these here.\n\n317\n00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.940\nA regular photo like what we're seeing\nhere on the screen where Dr. Tommy is\n\n318\n00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.420\nshowing us of that background image of\nthat canyon and the information there.\n\n319\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.800\nThat is a fixed image, and\n\n320\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.310\nthat's one of those images where if,\nand we don't wanna try this right now.\n\n321\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.350\nBut, if we were to try and\nresize that picture and\n\n322\n00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.960\nwe would resize it multiple times\nby squeezing it in and coming out.\n\n323\n00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.830\nYou would see that image get blurrier.\n\n324\n00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.800\nAnd that's because that is a special type\nof graphic that we call a raster image.\n\n325\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.320\nThere's a limited amount\nof pixels in there.\n\n326\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.480\nSo when you squeeze it,\nit's like squeezing out a sponge and\n\n327\n00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.820\nall the water out of it.\n\n328\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.880\nThe idea of you being able to\npick up all that stuff and\n\n329\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.910\nputting it in the right order\nagain is just about impossible.\n\n330\n00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.050\nSo what it does is that the computer\nwhen you start doing this,\n\n331\n00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.190\nit tries to actually interpret that.\n\n332\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.690\nAnd it does a good job at giving\nus that overall image again, but\n\n333\n00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.680\nthe more often that you do it,\nthe more it's gonna get blurry.\n\n334\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.260\nThose other shapes that Dr.\n\n335\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.020\nTommy put in there though,\nthose are what we call vector images.\n\n336\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.714\nAnd that's kind of strange,\n\n337\n00:18:21.714 --> 00:18:25.585\nbecause that's based on mathematical\npoints around that figure.\n\n338\n00:18:25.585 --> 00:18:30.321\nAnd the reason why that's important is,\nthose images as you resize them bigger or\n\n339\n00:18:30.321 --> 00:18:30.947\nsmaller.\n\n340\n00:18:30.947 --> 00:18:34.914\nThere not having to actually try and say,\nlet me just try to put that image back in.\n\n341\n00:18:34.914 --> 00:18:38.217\nAnd it literally calculates\nthe math of that picture and\n\n342\n00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:43.005\nthen it knows exactly where every single\npoint in that picture actually exists.\n\n343\n00:18:43.005 --> 00:18:46.984\nSo that gives you that ability to keep\na very sharp image when you are very tiny,\n\n344\n00:18:46.984 --> 00:18:48.868\nor when you expand it all the way out.\n\n345\n00:18:48.868 --> 00:18:51.426\nIt still keeps that sharp image as well.\n\n346\n00:18:51.426 --> 00:18:55.633\nAnd bitmaps though, tend to actually\nwork more like the little image there\n\n347\n00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:58.236\nof a smiling face pointing at you,\nlaughing,\n\n348\n00:18:58.236 --> 00:19:00.939\nworks more like the idea\nof the raster graphic.\n\n349\n00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:04.222\nSo you do need to be careful on certain\nimages that you're presenting such as\n\n350\n00:19:04.222 --> 00:19:07.870\nphotos, and of course everything\nthat's actually labeled as a bitmap.\n\n351\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.079\nNow here's a chart, and what we're\ntrying to do here of course is to make\n\n352\n00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:16.157\nan emphasis inside of our report\nabout some data that we see existing.\n\n353\n00:19:16.157 --> 00:19:19.818\nAnd these are actually very\ngood in the middle of reports.\n\n354\n00:19:19.818 --> 00:19:22.851\nBecause they help to summarize,\nthey help to aggregate\n\n355\n00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:27.420\na lot of information where people will\njust, after a while, stop reading.\n\n356\n00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.210\nAnd so, it really helps you to now, as\nyou're having to give that presentation,\n\n357\n00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:35.020\nthat report, and say, turn to page 18 and\nthey see six paragraphs.\n\n358\n00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.300\nWell, you can say, well, look at\nthe image right here, look at the chart.\n\n359\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.380\nAnd this will help explain everything\nthat we're explaining on this paper.\n\n360\n00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.440\nSo, it's really going to actually be one\nof the powerful images that you add in.\n\n361\n00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.620\nAnd it is an element that you\nreally do need to get used to.\n\n362\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.090\nNot everybody wants to just see paragraph\nafter paragraph after paragraph.\n\n363\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.324\nThey expect some type of break for\ntheir eyes, and\n\n364\n00:19:56.324 --> 00:19:58.644\nimages are a perfect way to do that.\n\n365\n00:19:58.644 --> 00:20:03.687\n>> Wow, I think now we have some bits and\npieces that we can challenge ourselves and\n\n366\n00:20:03.687 --> 00:20:07.009\nsay whoa, I can go and\ncreate a beautiful document.\n\n367\n00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:11.280\nI can put images, I can put tables,\nI can put whatever.\n\n368\n00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.190\nSo now we're gonna talk a little bit\nabout another section on tables.\n\n369\n00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:21.490\nBut before we go to the tables, just\nthink about what Ronnie just spoke about.\n\n370\n00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:26.180\nIf we have an image,\nwe can easily play around with text and\n\n371\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.393\noverlap images with text.\n\n372\n00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:32.484\nSuch that you don't have\nto have an image and\n\n373\n00:20:32.484 --> 00:20:37.361\nthen have text just following\nright below or after.\n\n374\n00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:41.225\nWe could easily play around with\npositioning of an image when there\n\n375\n00:20:41.225 --> 00:20:42.040\nis text.\n\n376\n00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.990\nSo let's just hypothetically say\nthat I wanted to have this text, so\n\n377\n00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.919\nI'm going to copy some\ntext from a section here.\n\n378\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.070\nAnd go back to this image that\nI've created, I've put over here.\n\n379\n00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.960\nSo, I'm gonna type this text over here.\n\n380\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.300\nSo as it is right now,\n\n381\n00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:01.050\nit gives me an impression that I can\nonly have an image followed by a text.\n\n382\n00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.260\nBut that doesn't always apply.\n\n383\n00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.430\nI could very easily reorganize\nthe way the document looks\n\n384\n00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.130\nby wrapping text around the image.\n\n385\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:16.700\nAnd so I could very easily say,\nI want something like tight or square.\n\n386\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.062\nAnd see, what has just happened\nis that the text has moved, and\n\n387\n00:21:20.062 --> 00:21:22.866\nit's just wrapping around\nthat particular image.\n\n388\n00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:26.692\nSo this way for someone who's working\non something like a report or\n\n389\n00:21:26.692 --> 00:21:30.654\nyou're trying to interplay text and\nimages, so those people read,\n\n390\n00:21:30.654 --> 00:21:34.680\nthey can connect very well visually\nwhat exactly was happening.\n\n391\n00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.390\nBecause if you just\nsometimes put an image only,\n\n392\n00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.700\nyou are letting people decide\nwhat to think about that image.\n\n393\n00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.740\nBut if you put some text\nnext to it you correlate,\n\n394\n00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.120\nyou can guide their thinking\naround that particular image.\n\n395\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.190\nI want to believe that that's\na very useful way of mixing,\n\n396\n00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.220\nand is a powerful way of mixing text and\nimage.\n\n397\n00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.760\nRemember, people interact with documents.\n\n398\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.810\nAnd they go through different experiences\nas they go through the documents.\n\n399\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.690\nSo you really want to have\nsome element of influence,\n\n400\n00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.340\nbecause you want to pass that\nparticular message to a reader.\n\n401\n00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.261\nIsn't it?\n\n402\n00:22:07.261 --> 00:22:11.140\n>> No doubt that this is one of the most\npowerful ways you can use something\n\n403\n00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.811\nlike Word.\n\n404\n00:22:11.811 --> 00:22:16.338\nBecause adding in that one image\nmay actually indicate something for\n\n405\n00:22:16.338 --> 00:22:17.280\nthat reader.\n\n406\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.642\nAs a reader, they're like,\nI'm not sure, either the chart or\n\n407\n00:22:20.642 --> 00:22:23.880\npicture here makes that\npoint you want to emphasize.\n\n408\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.810\nNow you do want to use them\nin those emphatic points.\n\n409\n00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.380\nNot necessarily just on every\nsingle page cuz you're saying,\n\n410\n00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.750\nthis page doesn't have an image.\n\n411\n00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.820\nCan you do that?\n\n412\n00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.010\nAbsolutely, of course you can do that.\n\n413\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.300\nBut what you really wanna do is use\nthose images to really help you to make\n\n414\n00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.130\nthe impact that you want to make.\n\n415\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.790\nAnd if somebody does ask you,\nis there something that we\n\n416\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.750\ncan put in there to make this space\nfill up a little bit better to do that?\n\n417\n00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.878\nWell, Dr. Tommy just showed us the way\nto make that text flow around it,\n\n418\n00:22:51.878 --> 00:22:55.678\nor to make it move around,\nmove beside it, or below it or above it.\n\n419\n00:22:55.678 --> 00:23:00.247\nHowever you want to do it, you may find\nthat this is the way to make your document\n\n420\n00:23:00.247 --> 00:23:03.099\na bit more interesting and\na bit more appealing.\n\n421\n00:23:03.099 --> 00:23:03.756\nThat allows,\n\n422\n00:23:03.756 --> 00:23:07.695\nof course the reader that's actually gonna\nhave to go through all of this, to realize\n\n423\n00:23:07.695 --> 00:23:11.382\nthat hey here's somebody that put a bit\nof time into this particular document.\n\n424\n00:23:11.382 --> 00:23:14.525\nAnd actually wanted to include in\nthings that are very relevant.\n\n425\n00:23:14.525 --> 00:23:18.523\nSo it is very helpful, it really does\nmake the impact that we want it to make.\n\n426\n00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:22.811\n>> Awesome, so we don't have a lot of\ntime, so we always have to try and\n\n427\n00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:25.769\nkeep moving, so\nI hope you're right with us.\n\n428\n00:23:25.769 --> 00:23:29.409\nWe spoke about inserting things,\nwe've talk about images,\n\n429\n00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:33.055\nwe've talk about clip arts,\nwe've talk about paragraphs.\n\n430\n00:23:33.055 --> 00:23:35.560\nWe talked about a number of things.\n\n431\n00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.590\nSo, there's one more thing that you can\ninsert that can make a document really,\n\n432\n00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.670\nreally powerful.\n\n433\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.665\nThat's a table so,\n\n434\n00:23:40.665 --> 00:23:44.425\nI gave a hint that that's an exactly\nthing we're gonna talk about shortly.\n\n435\n00:23:44.425 --> 00:23:48.372\nSo, we gonna try and think about tables,\nwhy do you need tables?\n\n436\n00:23:48.372 --> 00:23:52.277\nIt's obvious, sometimes text needs\nto be organized in columns and rows.\n\n437\n00:23:52.277 --> 00:23:59.322\nAnd we spoke about Excel a while back, and\nAccess Did Microsoft Access a while back.\n\n438\n00:23:59.322 --> 00:24:00.827\nBut we are not there yet,\n\n439\n00:24:00.827 --> 00:24:04.920\nand those are a little more\ncomplex platforms to work with.\n\n440\n00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.680\nBut in a Microsoft Word document\nyou can create tables, and\n\n441\n00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.120\ntables just help you to organize\nthings in columns and rows.\n\n442\n00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.010\nPeople understand certain kind of\ntext better when it's organized in\n\n443\n00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.360\ncolumns and rows.\n\n444\n00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.670\nWhat do we talk about bulletin and putting\nnumbers one, two, three, four, five,\n\n445\n00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:27.018\nthat's for very simple text but\nwhen you have things that are related and\n\n446\n00:24:27.018 --> 00:24:30.720\nso and so was born on this,\nwhen you look for\n\n447\n00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.690\nexample at a calendar,\nit has rows and columns.\n\n448\n00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.070\nSo we get a sense of where the weeks\nare and what are the days of the week.\n\n449\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.620\nSo that's what we're gonna do shortly.\n\n450\n00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.440\nAnd we'll play around\nwith tables quite a bit.\n\n451\n00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:49.700\nSo what I'm gonna do on my computer is\nI'll go to the next page, and I you know\n\n452\n00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.710\nI'm just creating some document as I keep\ngoing, so I'm gonnajust take this text.\n\n453\n00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.668\nAnd insert page, I hope you do remember.\n\n454\n00:24:57.668 --> 00:25:01.890\nSo I'm gonna end of this document and\nI say Insert Page Break.\n\n455\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.700\nSo it takes me to a new page, and\nthen I'm going to say My Tables.\n\n456\n00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.180\nAnd what I like to do is I'll make it\ntitle Format, so I'll go to Heading 1.\n\n457\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:19.010\nSo that way, in as much as I'm just doing\nexercises here it's also interesting.\n\n458\n00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:26.270\nAll right, so I go to Insert, and I see\nTables here, so it stands on its own.\n\n459\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.800\nI say Table, and then it opens up the\npossibility of picking columns and rows,\n\n460\n00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:37.390\nso let's say I want to have a table\nof about four rows, five rows.\n\n461\n00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:41.510\nMaybe five colors so I scroll across,\nthat's one way to do it.\n\n462\n00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:45.210\nI could have gone ahead and\nclick draw table or insert table and\n\n463\n00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.530\nwhen I say insert table it would tell me\nokay so how many columns do you want and\n\n464\n00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.580\nhow many rows?\n\n465\n00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.240\nThat's another way to do it.\n\n466\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.370\nI can also draw table or\nI can pick a table from an Excel document.\n\n467\n00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.790\nAll those options exist and that's\nthe beauty of this kind of a platform.\n\n468\n00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:03.490\nBut let's just quickly create a table\nof five rows and five columns.\n\n469\n00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.750\nThere we go, I have click it,\nI have a table.\n\n470\n00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.320\nLet's scroll down,\nI have a table already set out.\n\n471\n00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.540\nAnd I can say well I want to make sure\nthat on the left I put numbers so\n\n472\n00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.410\nI can easily resize the table.\n\n473\n00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:23.437\nAnd say well,\nsomewhere here I want to have numbers,\n\n474\n00:26:23.437 --> 00:26:28.462\n1, I don't know what\nhappened to my computer, 3,\n\n475\n00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:33.042\n4, [LAUGH] so\nI'm gonna have this as number 1 and\n\n476\n00:26:33.042 --> 00:26:40.783\nthen maybe somewhere here I want to create\nsome title somewhere here and say Name.\n\n477\n00:26:48.676 --> 00:26:49.954\nAge.\n\n478\n00:26:53.698 --> 00:26:56.800\nAnd whatever else I could like to add,\nokay?\n\n479\n00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.020\nSo and I say well I can delete this row.\n\n480\n00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.150\nWe'll talk about that\nlater in a little while.\n\n481\n00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.234\nMy name is Tonny.\n\n482\n00:27:04.234 --> 00:27:06.204\nSomething is happening\nto my computer today.\n\n483\n00:27:15.917 --> 00:27:16.939\n100.\n\n484\n00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:17.556\n>> 100.\n\n485\n00:27:17.556 --> 00:27:18.864\n[LAUGH]\n>> Do I look like that?\n\n486\n00:27:18.864 --> 00:27:20.372\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n487\n00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:21.666\n>> You look much younger than 100.\n\n488\n00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:24.975\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, so there you go.\n\n489\n00:27:24.975 --> 00:27:25.908\n>> I don't but you do.\n\n490\n00:27:25.908 --> 00:27:27.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> I do, okay, all right, great.\n\n491\n00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:33.100\nI can have many rows and columns, and\nI can insert things as I go along.\n\n492\n00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.180\nI can very easily resize that table,\ncolumns and rows.\n\n493\n00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.730\nIf I wanna resize the whole table,\n\n494\n00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.270\nI can click the corner and,\nthere we go resize the whole table.\n\n495\n00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.030\nI could do many things\nas well in this table.\n\n496\n00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.040\nAnd I'm gonna challenge you\nto go through the manual and\n\n497\n00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.770\nget to see many other\nthings that you could do.\n\n498\n00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:56.290\nSo hypothetically let's say I would\nlike to combine these two columns.\n\n499\n00:27:56.290 --> 00:28:00.679\nI can just come and\nselect the two cells and\n\n500\n00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:06.833\nthen I could say, mm-hm,\nwell what could I possibly do?\n\n501\n00:28:06.833 --> 00:28:08.220\nI can merge these cells.\n\n502\n00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.260\nSo when you right-click a table,\n\n503\n00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.260\nit gives you various options of\nwhat you can do with that table.\n\n504\n00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.580\nSo let's say I want to\nmerge these two cells.\n\n505\n00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.050\nI click this, I select one cell, and\nthen hold my cursor down and move up.\n\n506\n00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.020\nAnd then I right-click,\nit gives me some options.\n\n507\n00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.876\nYou can merge the two\ncells if you wanted and\n\n508\n00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:31.499\nif I do that means one line disappears.\n\n509\n00:28:31.499 --> 00:28:35.564\nI can undo that, Ctrl+Z.\n\n510\n00:28:35.564 --> 00:28:38.265\nI can say, well,\nI want to do something else.\n\n511\n00:28:38.265 --> 00:28:41.910\nMaybe I want to insert a raw\nright below number four.\n\n512\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:47.100\nI can select click anywhere in that row,\nright-click and then I say Insert.\n\n513\n00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.460\nI can insert a row right below or above.\n\n514\n00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.880\nSo let's say I wanna do below,\nboom, there I have a new row.\n\n515\n00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.960\nIf I want to do a column\nI can select anywhere and\n\n516\n00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.370\ninsert into the right or\nto the left, I have a column.\n\n517\n00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.480\nSo there are many things I can do.\n\n518\n00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.521\nLet's say I want to make this table\nto have some little bit of color some\n\n519\n00:29:06.521 --> 00:29:07.628\nbeauty around it.\n\n520\n00:29:07.628 --> 00:29:09.682\nSo, if I double-click the table,\n\n521\n00:29:09.682 --> 00:29:13.250\nright of the top corner to\nthe there's a plus sign over there.\n\n522\n00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:18.900\nIf I click it, it brings\nthe design tab of Microsoft Word.\n\n523\n00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.215\nAnd gives me a bit of options of what\nI could make that table look like.\n\n524\n00:29:23.215 --> 00:29:24.765\nNow, as I scroll across,\n\n525\n00:29:24.765 --> 00:29:28.795\nI can see interesting design that\nhave already been made up front.\n\n526\n00:29:28.795 --> 00:29:30.285\nIf I click this arrow somewhere here,\n\n527\n00:29:30.285 --> 00:29:34.435\nI have a set of options that\nI could actually play with.\n\n528\n00:29:34.435 --> 00:29:39.450\nI kind of like blue, so\nI'm gonna select blue and there we go.\n\n529\n00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.720\nSome design has been made.\n\n530\n00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.860\nSo, look, I didn't have to\nspend my time trying to paint,\n\n531\n00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.230\nand thinking about cells,\nhow are they going to look like.\n\n532\n00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.060\nBut, as you can see,\nmy borders have been lost.\n\n533\n00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.360\nThat's a design, and so, if I want\nto bring back the borders, I can,\n\n534\n00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.000\nsimply, click that table,\nselect it all and\n\n535\n00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.910\nI can come to the borders here and\nI can select all borders.\n\n536\n00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.380\nSo my borders are back and\nI have a table it looks interesting.\n\n537\n00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:11.060\nIf I don't like maybe the white background\ntext and I want to change it I can go back\n\n538\n00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:16.050\nhome and I click select text and\nit's now red so all our flexibility exist.\n\n539\n00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.370\nNow I have a table to play with.\n\n540\n00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:23.170\nThere are many other things\nyou can do with a table,\n\n541\n00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.770\ndepends on what your taste is.\n\n542\n00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:29.030\nIf I wanted to put a heading for\nthat table, I can come and\n\n543\n00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.960\nclick, select the entire table.\n\n544\n00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.803\nAnd then I go Insert Caption,\n\n545\n00:30:32.803 --> 00:30:36.509\nand it say this is a Figure, but\nnow I can just call it Table.\n\n546\n00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:43.426\nSo I want it at the top or below, so\nlet's say Above I could say, simple table.\n\n547\n00:30:46.153 --> 00:30:49.440\nThere we go, I have a table,\nit has some caption.\n\n548\n00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.040\nI want to believe, Ronnie,\nyou have worked with tables before,\n\n549\n00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.390\nand it's one great powerful tool,\nisn't it?\n\n550\n00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.580\n>> It really does help us to\nconvey a tremendous amount of data\n\n551\n00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.700\nin a very small format.\n\n552\n00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:06.120\nSo when I do have multiple pieces of\ndata that I know that are interrelated.\n\n553\n00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.670\nTables inside of Excel really can\nbe either imported into Word,\n\n554\n00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.470\nlike what we have or\nwe can create one on the fly.\n\n555\n00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.340\nAnd this one doesn't make\na connection to someplace else.\n\n556\n00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:20.080\nBut if you really want to show those\ninterrelationships very quickly.\n\n557\n00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.610\nBut you don't want to do it\nparagraph after paragraph.\n\n558\n00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.860\nCreating the table really helps you out.\n\n559\n00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:29.650\nSo, when you start seeing series of data\nthat you might have to type out inside of\n\n560\n00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.760\nyour document because somebody says,\nall this data needs to be in part of\n\n561\n00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:37.000\nthe report, well, you might want to see,\nif you can create a table instead and\n\n562\n00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.930\nhave that data listed out\nin the way that you want.\n\n563\n00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.560\nNormally, the way that I've seen this\nof course is by tracking things like\n\n564\n00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.900\nSales of a particular company,\nwhere we have different salespeople.\n\n565\n00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.149\nAnd then we can track them month by month.\n\n566\n00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:54.930\nWe can show by the quarter what particular\nsalesperson has actually generated,\n\n567\n00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.584\nin terms of either leads or\nof actual, real Collections, and\n\n568\n00:31:58.584 --> 00:32:00.924\nwe can actually list that into a table.\n\n569\n00:32:00.924 --> 00:32:05.492\nIf not, I would have to actually write a\nparagraph about each particular individual\n\n570\n00:32:05.492 --> 00:32:10.290\nsales person and say, here's what was\naccomplished during this month for that.\n\n571\n00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.950\nAnd then you'd have paragraph\nnumber two for the next person,\n\n572\n00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:17.140\nparagraph number three for the next,\nand you would continue to do that.\n\n573\n00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:22.000\nInstead, what I can do is say here are my\nsales figures for this first quarter or\n\n574\n00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.530\nthis third quarter, and\nlet me show you that in this table, and\n\n575\n00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.600\nhave all my salespeople listed\non the left-hand side, and\n\n576\n00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.360\nhave the months by the quarters and show.\n\n577\n00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.302\nAnd then say, at the top by adding in\na title, of saying something like,\n\n578\n00:32:35.302 --> 00:32:38.990\nhere are the collections for\nthe third quarter by sales person.\n\n579\n00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.110\nAnd notice that I'm no longer\nwriting three or four or\n\n580\n00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:46.590\nfive paragraphs, I now have a single\ntable that displays all that information.\n\n581\n00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.890\nSomebody can quickly take that\ndocument and look over that table and\n\n582\n00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.230\nfind the information that their\nneeding exactly right then and there.\n\n583\n00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.370\nAnd it really does add\na powerful element to it\n\n584\n00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:59.100\nbecause now you're not\nhaving to search through.\n\n585\n00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.906\nYou're actually saying, all right, take\na look at this particular salesperson.\n\n586\n00:33:02.906 --> 00:33:06.510\nAnd then that way you can actually see\nsummarized what they did in that entire\n\n587\n00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.057\nquarter or even by each month, and\nwhether or not they're also tracking or\n\n588\n00:33:10.057 --> 00:33:13.210\nthey're trending in the right way,\nor maybe not in the right way,\n\n589\n00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.960\nto help you to make a business decision,\nas well.\n\n590\n00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.850\nTables are very powerful elements when\nyou have a tremendous amount of data\n\n591\n00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.560\nthat you really need to be able\nto look at all at one time,\n\n592\n00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.570\ninstead of paragraph by paragraph.\n\n593\n00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.590\nHaving them inside of your Word\ndocument is a very powerful element\n\n594\n00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:32.712\nthat we can always have and\nalways a great tool to use.\n\n595\n00:33:32.712 --> 00:33:36.720\n>> Wonderful, so our time is really up.\n\n596\n00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.940\nBut just before you go, there's one\nmore thing we're gonna talk about.\n\n597\n00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.020\nThink about finding text in a document.\n\n598\n00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.338\nSo you have a large document and\nso you can just simply search for\n\n599\n00:33:48.338 --> 00:33:51.763\nspecific words, replace them,\ndelete them, so\n\n600\n00:33:51.763 --> 00:33:57.653\nthat you don't have to read the whole\ndocument, sequentially, looking for words.\n\n601\n00:33:57.653 --> 00:33:59.899\nSo there's a function that\nenables us to do that,\n\n602\n00:33:59.899 --> 00:34:02.770\nthere's a capability that\nenables us to do that.\n\n603\n00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:06.490\nI like also interchanging between\nmany words and shortcuts.\n\n604\n00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:11.990\nSo if I click Ctrl F, it gives me an\nopportunity to quickly search for a word.\n\n605\n00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:17.960\nSo I could say, well, I'm interesting\nin getting can, and then I say, Enter.\n\n606\n00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.770\nAutomatically, it selects for\nme the locations where the word can be.\n\n607\n00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:26.880\nAnd with this tool, I could very\neasily change the word or other words.\n\n608\n00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.610\nMaybe I was typing something and\n\n609\n00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.830\nI forgot that we were talking\nabout a different city.\n\n610\n00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:35.568\nSo I have put in Florida,\nbut now I realize no,\n\n611\n00:34:35.568 --> 00:34:37.500\nno, no, it's supposed to be New York.\n\n612\n00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:42.080\nAnd the document is large, and\nwe're using that Florida several times, or\n\n613\n00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.330\nwe're talking about Nairobi and\nit should have been Cape Town.\n\n614\n00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.220\nAnd so you can search for Cape Town,\nor Nairobi for that matter, and\n\n615\n00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.160\nthen replace the entire.\n\n616\n00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.730\nAnd you can also get\na chance to quickly look,\n\n617\n00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.660\nmaybe you don't need to change everything.\n\n618\n00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.288\nSo you can quickly look at\neverywhere you used Nairobi.\n\n619\n00:35:00.288 --> 00:35:04.100\nMaybe you say Nairobi,\nKenya, and that's correct,\n\n620\n00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:08.200\nbut maybe somebody else made a mistake,\nsomeone said Nairobi, South Africa.\n\n621\n00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.240\nSo then you have an opportunity\nto quickly check and say,\n\n622\n00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.570\nwell, is it correct all\nthrough the entire document?\n\n623\n00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.830\nJust by focusing on Nairobi only.\n\n624\n00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:20.280\nSo that function exists, and\non the basis of that you can make changes.\n\n625\n00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.880\nAnd the last thing that I think I want\npeople to pick is that you can track\n\n626\n00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.230\nchanges that you make in a document.\n\n627\n00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:34.430\nAnd for me that's another very, very\npowerful tool that enables you to know\n\n628\n00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:38.530\nif I sent this document to someone to make\na comment, what changes did they make?\n\n629\n00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.116\nIt could be the very large document.\n\n630\n00:35:40.116 --> 00:35:42.040\nI don't want to go through\nevery single line to see,\n\n631\n00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:46.340\ncomparing with what I already had\nbefore to see where they made a change.\n\n632\n00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.740\nSo you can introduce a tracking mechanism.\n\n633\n00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.070\nAnd tracking mechanism is right\nunder the review section,\n\n634\n00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.830\nwhere you click this button\ncalled track changes.\n\n635\n00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:59.079\nIf I click it, then it means whenever I\nmake a change in the document [SOUND],\n\n636\n00:35:59.079 --> 00:36:02.655\nanything that comes after I\nalready submitted this document,\n\n637\n00:36:02.655 --> 00:36:05.775\nor saved the document,\nwill be tracked differently.\n\n638\n00:36:05.775 --> 00:36:10.096\nAnd if I send it to someone else, that\nperson can add elements to the document,\n\n639\n00:36:10.096 --> 00:36:14.540\nbut they will also appear differently,\nso it will be a different color.\n\n640\n00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:18.731\nOne thing I could very easily\ndo is that I can actually\n\n641\n00:36:18.731 --> 00:36:21.530\nput comments onto the text, so, for\n\n642\n00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:26.840\nexample, I want to explain to someone why,\nexactly, I used this word, into.\n\n643\n00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.090\nSo I can select that word and\nclick comment, and\n\n644\n00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:33.480\nthen it creates some kind of a bubble\nover there and say, this is why.\n\n645\n00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:39.223\nSo then I send this document to someone\nelse and they go, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n646\n00:36:39.223 --> 00:36:40.330\nyeah, yeah, now I understand.\n\n647\n00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.430\nSo I don't have to make a phone call,\nor write an email, or\n\n648\n00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:44.880\nwalk over to them to explain.\n\n649\n00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.960\nThey can actually see that bit,\nand choose to accept it or not.\n\n650\n00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.480\nSo if they choose to accept it,\n\n651\n00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:56.040\nthey can delete that bubble,\nlike I've just deleted.\n\n652\n00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:01.460\nAnd if that change that was made,\nlike there, and\n\n653\n00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.990\nthey feel that this is okay, they can\nactually go and accept that change, so\n\n654\n00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.730\nthen the document goes back to normal.\n\n655\n00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.540\nSo using this tool we can track a whole,\nedit a whole,\n\n656\n00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.570\nlarge document, communicate within\nourselves as we work on this document.\n\n657\n00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:18.890\nI hope this is a true,\nuseful tool that we can use.\n\n658\n00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:23.550\n>> These are great tools, especially when\nyou're working with a bunch of people.\n\n659\n00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:27.568\nSo, for example, here in our studios we,\nof course, as we began,\n\n660\n00:37:27.568 --> 00:37:30.398\nwe created a mission statement,\nwhich we did.\n\n661\n00:37:30.398 --> 00:37:34.303\nAnd what we could have done is we could\nhave actually typed out several different,\n\n662\n00:37:34.303 --> 00:37:38.100\nin other words, everybody come up\nwith their own mission statement.\n\n663\n00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.950\nBut, instead, we might have actually\nsaid let's type it out this way, and\n\n664\n00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.580\nwe'll send it to everybody and\nsee what changes they would like to make.\n\n665\n00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.560\nWell, instead of me having to\nwrite that out and go, well,\n\n666\n00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.670\nhere's one I would submit, and\n\n667\n00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:52.890\nthen send that around to everyone else,\nwe can instead track that one document and\n\n668\n00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:56.620\nallow people to make those changes just\nlike what Dr. Tonny was talking about.\n\n669\n00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.710\nAnd then we can see who submitted what and\n\n670\n00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.720\nwhy they thought it was\nactually necessary to do so.\n\n671\n00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.780\nAnd in the very end,\nwhoever originated that document, well,\n\n672\n00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.730\nthey can go back through there and\nsay, hey, I like this change,\n\n673\n00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.650\nand accept that change or\nreject that change.\n\n674\n00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.950\nSo when you are using collaboration, and\n\n675\n00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.960\nyou're having to come up with a unified\ndocument, that really makes sense, and you\n\n676\n00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.820\nwant people's input on it, this is a very\npowerful way for us to be able to do so.\n\n677\n00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.160\nAnd in the end,\nyou may have that document, now,\n\n678\n00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.680\nwhere you might have gone through several\nrounds, several revisions of it, but\n\n679\n00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.200\nin the end, everybody goes, this is\nthe document that we really wanted to see.\n\n680\n00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.060\nAnd now you realize that you've\ngone through multiple changes here\n\n681\n00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.270\nwithout having sent multiple\ncopies of that document and go,\n\n682\n00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.955\nwhich revision were we working on now?\n\n683\n00:38:38.955 --> 00:38:42.340\nYou're actually using that\none document to help you out.\n\n684\n00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:46.240\nAnd it is, it's a tremendous productivity\ntool that really does help us.\n\n685\n00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.800\nAnd we can see why this is so\npowerful a feature inside of Word 2010.\n\n686\n00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.697\n>> Great, we've spent some time thinking\nabout specifics of Microsoft Word in\n\n687\n00:38:55.697 --> 00:38:59.028\nthis second episode of\nthe Microsoft Word section.\n\n688\n00:38:59.028 --> 00:39:03.890\nAnd we just wanna believe that you can now\ncreate tables, you can insert documents,\n\n689\n00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:07.587\nyou can put in, images,\nyou can play around with those images,\n\n690\n00:39:07.587 --> 00:39:10.760\nyou can create new columns,\nand all manner of things.\n\n691\n00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.710\nAnd you can collaborate,\nyou can actually send documents and\n\n692\n00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:17.620\ntell people exactly where to focus when\nthey are responding to your document.\n\n693\n00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.640\nI really want to believe, Ronny,\nthat this has been useful, and\n\n694\n00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.910\nthe same for our viewers.\n\n695\n00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:26.090\nWe can improve our productivity\nusing Microsoft Word.\n\n696\n00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:27.690\n>> There is no doubt about that.\n\n697\n00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:32.790\nThe very fact is you have now gotten\nan introduction into Microsoft Word 2010.\n\n698\n00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:36.820\nTake a look at both of these\nparts again as you review, and\n\n699\n00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:42.790\nas you continue on to improve and increase\nyour skills, of course, in Microsoft Word.\n\n700\n00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.050\nThis is a very foundational point for\nus, but learning these things\n\n701\n00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:50.640\nwill help you out as you continue towards\nyour work with computers, as well.\n\n702\n00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.500\nThat's a great place for\nus to also end this episode, then.\n\n703\n00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.770\nSigning off ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n704\n00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.060\n>> And I'm Tonny Omwansa,\nreally enjoyed learning together.\n\n705\n00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.060\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore Computing Fundamentals.\n\n706\n00:40:04.060 -->

00:00:19.840\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\nyou're watching the computing fundamentals\n\n4\n00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.832\nIC3 show where we're about to jump\ninto well Microsoft Excel 2010.\n\n5\n00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:26.694\nNow we're taking\nan introductory look at it so\n\n6\n00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:28.861\nthat we have the foundational\nskills that we need to.\n\n7\n00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.770\nAnd here to help us out\nwith that is gonna be Dr.\n\n8\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.310\nTonny Omwansa,\nwelcome back to our studios again.\n\n9\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.841\n>> Thank you very much, nice to see you\nall, and let's continue learning together.\n\n10\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.660\n>> So when we start talking about the idea\nof using Excel, we want to understand,\n\n11\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.060\nif we haven't actually\nbeen using this before,\n\n12\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.050\nit might be a little bit overwhelming.\n\n13\n00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.621\nBut when we start working with numbers\nthat need to actually have something done\n\n14\n00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:55.553\nwith them, some type of addition,\naveraging, or\n\n15\n00:00:55.553 --> 00:00:57.680\neven other things that we need to do.\n\n16\n00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.863\nIt helps us out because it allows us\nto actually take a tremendous amount of\n\n17\n00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:05.101\nnumbers to actually do that\nwell by using the computer and\n\n18\n00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:09.700\nthis particular application is one of\nthe most fun applications that we can use.\n\n19\n00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.210\nAnd even though it seems a little\nbit intimidating at the beginning,\n\n20\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.688\nit becomes more intuitive\nthe more that you use it.\n\n21\n00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:19.990\nAnd so Dr. Tonny's gonna help us by\nshowing us what we need to understand\n\n22\n00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.600\nright at the beginning.\n\n23\n00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.850\nSo where are we gonna begin, Dr. Tonny?\n\n24\n00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.158\n>> Thanks very much and\nglad to see you all.\n\n25\n00:01:25.158 --> 00:01:29.250\nAnd there's always this feeling\nthat Excel is a little complicated.\n\n26\n00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.180\nAnd working with numbers it's actually a\nperception and when I was in school I used\n\n27\n00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.260\nto struggle with mathematics and\nI discovered it was just a perception.\n\n28\n00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.170\nAnd somebody just went, look relax,\ntake it easy, you need numbers for life.\n\n29\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.440\nAnd you need to, you're gonna do\nbasic mathematics wherever you go.\n\n30\n00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.400\nSo, right now I just wanna encourage you,\ntake it easy.\n\n31\n00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.070\nWe're gonna learn a little bit\nabout the interface of Excel.\n\n32\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.260\nWe're gonna try and figure out, how do you\nnavigate yourself around workbooks and\n\n33\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.510\nExcel sheets by thinking\nabout the general structure\n\n34\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.400\nbasically of how an Excel\ndocument is organized.\n\n35\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.244\nHow could you move quickly because when\nyou have a lot of data on a sheet,\n\n36\n00:02:05.244 --> 00:02:08.750\nyou really want to be able to move up and\nabout quickly.\n\n37\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.280\nHow could you possibly create formulas?\n\n38\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.310\nBecause sometimes you want\nto compute things, and\n\n39\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.310\nit can be a fairly complex formula.\n\n40\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.900\nAnd sometimes you also want to insert\nvalues that whenever you make that entry,\n\n41\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.270\nit has a cascading effect.\n\n42\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.880\nIt changes certain things\nin the entire document.\n\n43\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.290\nSo, we'll also learn how to play\naround with formulas and functions.\n\n44\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.590\nAnd then we'll try to figure\nout how to summarize and\n\n45\n00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.020\nillustrate the data using chats.\n\n46\n00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.090\nIt's a very beautiful experience.\n\n47\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.810\nAnd finally we'll also try to figure out\nhow do we organize the data in tables,\n\n48\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.060\ninto some form of a structure.\n\n49\n00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.180\nSo that's what we're going\nto spend time on, and\n\n50\n00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.790\nI don't know whether you're ready so\nwe get into action, right?\n\n51\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.280\nIt sounds like a great place for\nus to actually get started.\n\n52\n00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.280\nAnd I understand that because all\nof a sudden you we need to do this\n\n53\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.920\nonce we get into a working environment in\nwhich we will be dealing with numbers.\n\n54\n00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.710\nExcel has, by far, one of the most\nprolific tools that you will find anywhere\n\n55\n00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.540\non the planet, and has one of the tools\nthat people really do end up,\n\n56\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.910\nhe says I use the cliche,\nexcel at because they really do.\n\n57\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.140\nThey find that once you start working\nwith it, it really is a helpful tool and\n\n58\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.380\nthey can figure out how they\nreally can actually use\n\n59\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.750\nit to crunch the numbers\nthat they need to.\n\n60\n00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.702\nSo where we are going to begin of course\nthen is not only taking a look at\n\n61\n00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:28.929\nthe interface itself, but actually\ndealing with well how do I know what am\n\n62\n00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.383\nI actually going to be typing into, so Dr.\n\n63\n00:03:31.383 --> 00:03:35.777\nTonny introduce us to this concept of\nthe idea of worksheets and workbooks.\n\n64\n00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:38.628\n>> All right, so\nthat's the place to start, so\n\n65\n00:03:38.628 --> 00:03:43.279\nevery time you open a new document in\nExcel, and I'm sure by now we all know\n\n66\n00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:47.207\nhow to open, its something we\ncovered in a previous section.\n\n67\n00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:51.870\nSo every time you open a new document,\nnow I have something called Book1.\n\n68\n00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.690\nSo I just opened Excel, and\nhere's the page, and it's up there,\n\n69\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.768\nit's written Book1.\n\n70\n00:03:56.768 --> 00:03:59.380\nIf I wanna save it,\nI can save it in a different name.\n\n71\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.890\nBut now, that's interesting.\n\n72\n00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.640\nI like the way computers also operate,\n\n73\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.870\nbecause the border from what\nwe do on a regular basis.\n\n74\n00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.660\n>> If you get a book.\n\n75\n00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.510\nYou know that the book has chapters,\n\n76\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.520\nit's got pages, and when you put it\nall together then you have a book.\n\n77\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.720\nSo what we have here is a book.\n\n78\n00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.450\nNow, the interesting thing here is\nthat you can actually create pages\n\n79\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.550\nof that book.\n\n80\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.790\nAnd so what is really here is\njust a blank sheet of paper, and\n\n81\n00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.580\non the bottom left corner we have some\nname there Sheet1, Sheet2 and Sheet3.\n\n82\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.879\nThose are tabs, so\n\n83\n00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:38.190\nit's basically saying we have three pages\nof this document called Book1, all right?\n\n84\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.570\nSo with this just imagine that you\ncan actually click very many sheets,\n\n85\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.910\nlike I'm creating I'm already creating\nSheet4, a Sheet5, Sheet6, Sheet7.\n\n86\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.001\nAnd if I don't like what I'm doing,\n\n87\n00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:53.516\nI can actually delete therefore\nI've just removed Sheet7.\n\n88\n00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:57.010\nI can delete Sheet7,\nand now I have Sheet6.\n\n89\n00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.780\nSo back the way,\nall the way I can go back to Sheet1.\n\n90\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.650\nSo you see with that possibility,\nI can have very many sheets.\n\n91\n00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.050\nIt's really, really many sheets in\none simple book, how does that sound?\n\n92\n00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.490\n>> It really is something\nthat we need to understand.\n\n93\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.545\nA lot of times when we begin with Excel,\n\n94\n00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:16.052\nwe're not exactly sure where we're\ngonna be entering in data to.\n\n95\n00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:20.574\nBut think about each one of those sheets\nas beginning maybe the idea here of this\n\n96\n00:05:20.574 --> 00:05:22.470\nseparate topics, right?\n\n97\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.820\nYou might actually find yourself\nworking on one sheet so\n\n98\n00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.790\nthat you can calculate some\nnumbers such as a summary but\n\n99\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.430\nthen you might find yourself actually\ntrying to keep track of information on\n\n100\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.340\nmultiple different sheets as well but they\nare all related together in that one file.\n\n101\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.900\nSo that way you might have something\nlike a work book that you call my\n\n102\n00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.240\nSales figures.\n\n103\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.220\nAnd then inside of that workbook you\nmight actually crunch all the numbers.\n\n104\n00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.940\nIn other words,\ndo the calculations on one sheet.\n\n105\n00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.160\nAnd then you might keep track of each\nof your salespeople on a different\n\n106\n00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.330\nsheet as well.\n\n107\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.940\nAnd you can do stuff\nlike that as you need to.\n\n108\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.490\nSo this is the context that\nwe're working in but Dr. Tonny,\n\n109\n00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.610\nif I want to start to actually try and\nenter numbers in and work within that\n\n110\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.625\none sheet, what are some of the elements\nI need to actually understand here?\n\n111\n00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:12.340\n>> Okay, so now with that, with that\nfoundation of Sheet, Workbook and\n\n112\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.780\nWorksheet, I have just created\na document that I want us to work with.\n\n113\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.540\nSo I’ve just saved it as my trial Book.\n\n114\n00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.500\nJust convention of basic saving, and so\nI have a book there called my trial book.\n\n115\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.770\nIt is an Excel document and\nit has several sheets.\n\n116\n00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.100\nI've created three sheets,\none is called Student Sheet.\n\n117\n00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.370\nAnother one is called Sales,\nanother one is called Income.\n\n118\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.190\nNo, there was just random\nterms that I picked.\n\n119\n00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.950\nNow naming them is important\nbecause that way you get\n\n120\n00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.630\nto remember what was that sheet about?\n\n121\n00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.370\nWhat was the content that I had in there?\n\n122\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.010\nAnd now I'm just gonna\nstart entering document.\n\n123\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.362\nBut for us to do any entries here\nit's important to understand\n\n124\n00:06:56.362 --> 00:06:57.917\nthe structure of the sheet.\n\n125\n00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:01.108\nYou can see up here there are letters,\nA, B, C, D,\n\n126\n00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:04.265\nI really don't know what\nhappens when you reach Z.\n\n127\n00:07:04.265 --> 00:07:05.710\n[LAUGH] I'd like to see.\n\n128\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.988\nWhen you reach Z, hey they figured out\na way, they now introduce AB AC so\n\n129\n00:07:11.988 --> 00:07:17.522\nit's that way it's very, very possible\nto have very, very many columns.\n\n130\n00:07:17.522 --> 00:07:22.235\nNow let's go down, for\nrows we also have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n\n131\n00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:27.580\nI don't know what happens when you\nreach 100, you scroll down you'll see.\n\n132\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.350\nIt's very interesting,\nyou can have very many columns and rows.\n\n133\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.910\nNow, that intersection between the column\nand the row basically creates a cell.\n\n134\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.210\nSo the first cell that\nwe always have is A1,\n\n135\n00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.970\nwe have B1, we have C1,\nover here we have A2, etc.\n\n136\n00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:53.030\nSo with a cell, now you have the lowest\nlevel of granularity to play around with.\n\n137\n00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.080\nYou can put numbers there, and\nwe can put numbers in several cells.\n\n138\n00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.832\nSo it's important to understand that we\nwork with columns and rows and cells,\n\n139\n00:08:01.832 --> 00:08:03.640\nthat's where we enter data.\n\n140\n00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.492\nWe enter data in cells.\n\n141\n00:08:05.492 --> 00:08:09.900\nWhether it's gonna be text, you can put\nin a date, you can put in a number.\n\n142\n00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.780\nBut we always work with cells and\n\n143\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:17.590\nwe have to identify that cells using the\ncolumn and the row that it actually exist.\n\n144\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.810\nThat's simple.\n\n145\n00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:19.940\nUnlike Microsoft One,\n\n146\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.220\nwhere you really on an obligation\nto put things in specific cells.\n\n147\n00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.180\nThat's how we work in Excel.\n\n148\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.110\nAnd I can move around these\nExcel cells very easily.\n\n149\n00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.140\nIf I right now begin at the top corner and\n\n150\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.700\nI click my right arrow, I am now moving\none cell at a time to the right.\n\n151\n00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.660\nAnd if I point to the row and\nthen click it,\n\n152\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:46.820\nit's one cell at a time to downwards,\nor upwards, or to the left.\n\n153\n00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.470\nAnd there we go, so, let's just say well,\nhow to do something.\n\n154\n00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.016\nIf this is about students,\nI can say, well I like this,\n\n155\n00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:58.625\nI wanna start up here and say well,\nI want to put the student number here.\n\n156\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.270\nAnd then if I Tab, click the Tab,\nI can move to the right.\n\n157\n00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.730\nIt's a some other way\nof moving to the right.\n\n158\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.450\nOr I can just use the right\nbutton I mean right arrow.\n\n159\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.730\nAnd well, as you can tell, you can type\ntext that is larger than a particular cell\n\n160\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.380\nand you can always resize\nthe size of the cell.\n\n161\n00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.614\nSo I have student number there and\nI'm going to put First Name here.\n\n162\n00:09:21.614 --> 00:09:24.930\nAnd then I'll go the next one,\nI'll put Last Name.\n\n163\n00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:31.560\nLast Name, I come back here and then I\ngo and put to the next one I say age.\n\n164\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.140\nAll right, and I can resize them\na bit here so that it's easy to see.\n\n165\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:42.165\nNow note that every time I typed there was\ntext appearing here in this formula bar.\n\n166\n00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:45.985\nSo every time I point a particular text,\nI mean a particular cell,\n\n167\n00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:48.450\nI moved to a cell\nthe text actually appear.\n\n168\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.630\nSo I can get to see in the event\nthat text was a little long and\n\n169\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.110\nit's hidden a little bit.\n\n170\n00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.890\nI can see what it was as a whole.\n\n171\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.160\nIf I create a formula,\nI'm gonna put that formula up there, and\n\n172\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160\nI can easily see what\nthat formula looks like.\n\n173\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.170\nSo there we go.\n\n174\n00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.920\nNow, I'm gonna put a name.\n\n175\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.820\nMy name is Tonny.\n\n176\n00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.810\nWell, I'm a student today, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:11.850\nSo my student number is 1, and my first\nname is Tony, and my last name is Omwansa.\n\n178\n00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.075\nAnd as I said, I am looking\nforward to being 100 years old.\n\n179\n00:10:15.075 --> 00:10:20.020\n[LAUGH] Okay, so there you go,\nI have another student, true.\n\n180\n00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.843\nAnd I tab and I say, well,\nit's called James Peter, all right.\n\n181\n00:10:24.843 --> 00:10:28.630\nAnd the age there,\nhe told me he's about 18 years old.\n\n182\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.260\nAnd then, every time I tab, I mean,\n\n183\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.290\nI Enter, it takes me to\nthe beginning of the second row.\n\n184\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.190\nBased on exactly where I ended, it takes\nme to the beginning of the following row,\n\n185\n00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.170\nI see a number 3.\n\n186\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:47.017\nWell, I can keep on going, John Kamau, and\nthen I put that, he's about 40 years old.\n\n187\n00:10:47.017 --> 00:10:50.903\nSee, now data is already starting to\nget organized in columns and rows.\n\n188\n00:10:50.903 --> 00:10:55.920\nAnd I can now begin to manipulate each\ncolumn and row in different ways.\n\n189\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.170\nWe’re getting to the details\nof making life much easier.\n\n190\n00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.580\nFor example right now,\nI'm typing one, two, three.\n\n191\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.380\nI could actually automate that element.\n\n192\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.480\nI might be interested in getting totals or\nwhatever.\n\n193\n00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.640\nSo, so far what we've basically done is\njust get a sense of how the columns and\n\n194\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.890\nrows are organized and the sales and\n\n195\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.880\nhow to move around, the shortcuts\nof moving around here and there.\n\n196\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.360\nIf I wanna move to the right\nthen entire select,\n\n197\n00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.200\nwe'll come to that in a little while.\n\n198\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.160\nBut I hope you get a sense of how\nthe columns and rows are organized.\n\n199\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.010\nHow is that?\n\n200\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.160\n>> It really is something that\nwe have to be able to do.\n\n201\n00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:34.230\nAnd that's because we are working with\na tremendous calculating application here.\n\n202\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.030\nThe number of columns that we tend to find\ninside Excel 2010, which is the version\n\n203\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:45.340\nthat we're working in, is somewhere around\n65,000 columns if I remember it correctly.\n\n204\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.730\nAnd then the number of rows\nis a bit over a million rows.\n\n205\n00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.760\nSo, it is a lot of calculating power\nthat you have the ability to do there.\n\n206\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.226\n>> Being able to navigate to those places\nand locations, is by you finding out\n\n207\n00:12:00.226 --> 00:12:06.350\nexactly what column that your information\nis in and row your information is in.\n\n208\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.230\nAnd that will bring you to an intersecting\npoint to be able to help you out.\n\n209\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.300\nSo learning how to navigate around,\nunderstanding some of the features that\n\n210\n00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.310\nyou're seeing in the interface is gonna\nbe very important to us because later on\n\n211\n00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.330\nwe're gonna use those features,\nespecially when we get into formulas.\n\n212\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.920\nTo help us to actually make our\nformulas much more effective,\n\n213\n00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.260\nand you're gonna actually\nend up seeing why.\n\n214\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.960\nSo the basic navigation\nhere that he's shown you\n\n215\n00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.990\nis really gonna be important to help us to\nknow where we need to locate a value and\n\n216\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.920\ninformation is what we're\ngoing to be seeing.\n\n217\n00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.130\nNow, we do have a lot more to go so\nwhere do we head next, Dr. Tonny?\n\n218\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.715\n>> All right, now where we need to move\nto is thinking about how do we select?\n\n219\n00:12:42.715 --> 00:12:47.570\nBecause entering data in cells,\ncolumns and rows, that's step one.\n\n220\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.200\nNow we need to start playing\naround with that data.\n\n221\n00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.020\nJust like we did in Microsoft Word,\n\n222\n00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.470\nyou actually can select data,\nyou can create a range.\n\n223\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.862\nNow, as I move my cell, my cursor around,\nand I'm moving between cells,\n\n224\n00:13:00.862 --> 00:13:05.490\nright at the top corner there it gives me\na sense of what cell I'm dealing with.\n\n225\n00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.670\nSo that's B3,\nI'm moving to C4, there we go.\n\n226\n00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.510\nAnd I can see the content, so\nthis gives me the cell description and\n\n227\n00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.340\nit gives me the content\nof that particular cell.\n\n228\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.620\nSo let's say I'm interested in\ngetting all these last names.\n\n229\n00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.380\nOnly the three.\n\n230\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.810\nSo I can click somewhere at\nthe beginning of that cell.\n\n231\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.120\nAny time you click a cell,\nwell did I misspell my name?\n\n232\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.745\nHow can that be?\n\n233\n00:13:30.745 --> 00:13:31.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hmm, okay.\n\n234\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.450\nThere we go.\nSo I select-\n\n235\n00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.460\n>> You're 100 in the example,\n\n236\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.300\nso-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.260\n>> Maybe misspelling your name\n\n238\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.065\nmight happen.\n\n239\n00:13:38.065 --> 00:13:38.790\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and\n\n240\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.860\nthat gives us an opportunity\nto learn how to edit, right?\n\n241\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.480\n>> That's true.\n\n242\n00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.390\n>> Awesome, great.\n\n243\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:42.895\nWe'll be there.\n\n244\n00:13:42.895 --> 00:13:46.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I click a cell, so\n\n245\n00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.810\nI’ve selected this cell.\n\n246\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.962\nUnlike Microsoft Word where\nwhen you double click a cell,\n\n247\n00:13:50.962 --> 00:13:54.190\nI mean a particular word\nthen the word gets selected.\n\n248\n00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.360\nHere, we select a cell, so by clicking\nthe cell would basically select that cell.\n\n249\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.790\nNow, I can drag, holding my cursor down,\nI can actually drag.\n\n250\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.980\nAnd I have selected the entire text.\n\n251\n00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.895\nAnd if we use the same\ntools we used last time,\n\n252\n00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:13.870\nCtrl+C I can do Ctrl+C that means I've\ncopied, I can move to another cell and\n\n253\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.150\nI click Ctrl+V,\nI've actually taken the entire text there.\n\n254\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.581\nAnd I could do that several times.\n\n255\n00:14:19.581 --> 00:14:20.547\nI could also cut,\n\n256\n00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:24.680\nlike if I wanted to move this whole\ncolumn from that particular point.\n\n257\n00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.590\nSo, I can come and click the whole\ncolumn right at the top there.\n\n258\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:33.255\nI click C and just select everything and\nthen I can easily cut that and\n\n259\n00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:35.715\nmove it to E, and paste there.\n\n260\n00:14:35.715 --> 00:14:38.195\nThere you go, so\nI've already moved the entire text.\n\n261\n00:14:38.195 --> 00:14:40.765\nNow, there are times when\nI'm quickly undoing so\n\n262\n00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:42.915\nthat I go back to where exactly I was.\n\n263\n00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:46.435\nThere are times you might be interested\nin selecting more than one column\n\n264\n00:14:46.435 --> 00:14:48.965\nat the same time, some section.\n\n265\n00:14:48.965 --> 00:14:52.690\nSo maybe I'm interested in\nselecting the first name.\n\n266\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:56.780\nThen I click Control and\nI go through till age and\n\n267\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.530\nI've selected two sections of\nthe document at the same time.\n\n268\n00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.038\nI copy that and I go somewhere,\njust select somewhere,\n\n269\n00:15:04.038 --> 00:15:06.138\nclick somewhere, and paste it.\n\n270\n00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:08.310\nAnd all of a sudden I've\nmoved there two columns.\n\n271\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.080\nSo it's possible to play with more\nthan one column at the same time, or\n\n272\n00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.160\none section.\n\n273\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.960\nYou can move things around with ease,\nand I wonder, people who didn't have\n\n274\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.420\ncomputers before, how they used to operate\nwhen they're moving stuff like this.\n\n275\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.460\n>> It would have been very, difficult,\n\n276\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.196\nthey would have just re-created\nthe document itself.\n\n277\n00:15:26.196 --> 00:15:27.900\nWhat Dr.\nTonny has just showed us here, though,\n\n278\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.209\nis very interesting because it\nallows us to do a lot of things.\n\n279\n00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:34.800\nDr. Tonny, if you wanna select those\ntwo columns again, go ahead and\n\n280\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.670\ndo that for me.\n\n281\n00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.610\n>> So I will select two columns.\n\n282\n00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.600\nYou want the whole columns?\n\n283\n00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.300\n>> No, just the, yep.\n\n284\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:40.908\n>> Just the section like this?\n\n285\n00:15:40.908 --> 00:15:42.126\n>> Just the section like you did.\n\n286\n00:15:42.126 --> 00:15:43.679\n>> And then over here.\n\n287\n00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:48.420\n>> Now, you might think okay,\nwhy does this really matter?\n\n288\n00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.081\nNot only did he show us how to be able to\ncopy that and move it someplace else, but\n\n289\n00:15:52.081 --> 00:15:55.855\nlet's say that you were told that you\nneeded to re-edit these numbers, right,\n\n290\n00:15:55.855 --> 00:15:58.263\nthat actually went along\nwith each of these names.\n\n291\n00:15:58.263 --> 00:16:00.758\nWell, if you had a column and\nyou had 50 numbers and\n\n292\n00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:03.651\nyou realized that you were just\none off for every one, well,\n\n293\n00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:06.140\nyou'd still have to go back and\nmanually do that.\n\n294\n00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:13.030\nAnd then you have to click on Cell B2,\nand then you'd have to click on B, no, E.\n\n295\n00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.712\nIs it E?\n>> E2?\n\n296\n00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:17.112\n[LAUGH]\n>> I can't see.\n\n297\n00:16:17.112 --> 00:16:18.390\nMy eyesight is actually that bad.\n\n298\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.751\nSo and do that, and so\nyou would have to do that but now, Dr.\n\n299\n00:16:21.751 --> 00:16:25.476\nTani, if you use your Tab key,\ngo ahead and use your Tab key here.\n\n300\n00:16:25.476 --> 00:16:27.595\nNotice that if you continue to go down,\n\n301\n00:16:27.595 --> 00:16:32.460\nnotice that you can actually select that\nand actually goes between those two, see?\n\n302\n00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.200\nSo you can actually do that,\n\n303\n00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.550\nwhere, instead of having to actually go\nacross three of four different columns,\n\n304\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.430\nand go let me click here on B2, and then\nlet me click on E2, let me click on G2.\n\n305\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.620\nWell now, you can actually go through and\n\n306\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.790\nchange each one by using some of those\nnavigation features that we talked about\n\n307\n00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:53.280\nhere, when you select those columns that\nare actually not directly connected.\n\n308\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.429\nSo it can allow you to move quickly\nbetween columns as well, so\n\n309\n00:16:56.429 --> 00:17:00.667\nit's a very interesting feature because it\ndoes allow us to do that when we have more\n\n310\n00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:03.115\nthan the data that we\nare normally seeing here.\n\n311\n00:17:03.115 --> 00:17:06.103\nAnd that's what you'll normally\nbe facing a lot of times or\n\n312\n00:17:06.103 --> 00:17:10.111\nyou'll actually be interacting with is\npreexisting data In which sometimes,\n\n313\n00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:12.834\nall of a sudden it is,\nwe need these numbers updated.\n\n314\n00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:16.478\nAnd now you have to manually do that or\nyou can select those two columns and\n\n315\n00:17:16.478 --> 00:17:19.760\nupdate the information just\nby doing something like that.\n\n316\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.180\nIt makes it very easy\ninstead of actually trying to\n\n317\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.140\ngo did I do the wrong one last time?\n\n318\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.088\nYou now know that if you selected them,\n\n319\n00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.400\nyou can just go between\nthose two very easily.\n\n320\n00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.570\nAnd even more if you choose to.\n\n321\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:36.404\n>> Yeah, now we're going deeper, so\nI hope you're right there with us.\n\n322\n00:17:36.404 --> 00:17:40.300\nSo you are able to\nselect several sections.\n\n323\n00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.490\nThe very fact that you can\nselect a section also has some\n\n324\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.240\ninteresting capabilities.\n\n325\n00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.000\nSo let us say, I wanted to\n\n326\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.850\nsay these people are being allocated\na particular month of a year.\n\n327\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.126\nSo maybe this one is allocated January.\n\n328\n00:17:58.332 --> 00:17:59.340\nAnd this one is February.\n\n329\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.980\nAnd I say, well,\nthey're all these names, so\n\n330\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:10.700\ndon't want exactly what exactly I did,\nbut for now, I'm assuming that I have so\n\n331\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.900\nmany people in my list, and\nthey all had details like that.\n\n332\n00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.013\nNow each of these is supposed\nto having a month allocated, so\n\n333\n00:18:18.013 --> 00:18:20.403\nthese people are on duty\nin different months.\n\n334\n00:18:20.403 --> 00:18:24.690\nSo this number 1, 2, and 3,\nI have selected 1, 2, and 3.\n\n335\n00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.470\nInstead of me typing all\nthe way to number 11,\n\n336\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:33.150\nI can click right in the corner of\nthat selection, and I can drag down.\n\n337\n00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.839\nI can see number 6 is meaning\ncertain number 7, number 8,\n\n338\n00:18:35.839 --> 00:18:37.326\nnumber 9, number 10, boom.\n\n339\n00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:40.878\nAll the numbers have been started,\nso I don't have to type that, and\n\n340\n00:18:40.878 --> 00:18:44.981\nevery time I make a change, it kind of has\nthe intelligence to know that there was\n\n341\n00:18:44.981 --> 00:18:49.560\na sequence here, and let's just see what\nwe can do to maintain that sequence.\n\n342\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.110\nSo that selection now, you see,\nthat's the power of understanding how to\n\n343\n00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.930\nplay around with the selection,\nas an additional feature.\n\n344\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.460\nIf this January, February,\nthen the computer has a sense,\n\n345\n00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.875\nthat well maybe you want\nto go to March after that.\n\n346\n00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:06.665\nSo if I come select the two,\nokay, if I drag I'm holding my\n\n347\n00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:12.845\nmouse down, and then I'm dragging down,\nthere we go, all the way to October.\n\n348\n00:19:12.845 --> 00:19:16.765\nSo that's another way of saying\nthe selection feature being able to select\n\n349\n00:19:16.765 --> 00:19:21.500\na specific section is not only just for\ncopying, it's not only just for anything,\n\n350\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.590\nbut we can also use that\nfeature to extend text.\n\n351\n00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.110\nAsk yourself a question.\n\n352\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.280\nWhat if it was just January?\n\n353\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.315\nWhat if we didn't have February?\n\n354\n00:19:30.315 --> 00:19:33.190\nCuz this February seems to have\ngiven a hint that maybe you want to\n\n355\n00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.200\nincrease the months.\n\n356\n00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.352\nSo let's just see what happens.\n\n357\n00:19:35.352 --> 00:19:38.370\nI don't know, maybe I know, but let's see.\n\n358\n00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:43.937\nSo I click January, and then I click at\nthe corner, and then I start dragging.\n\n359\n00:19:43.937 --> 00:19:48.028\nIt has actually put the months there, so\nit has some little bit of intelligence.\n\n360\n00:19:48.028 --> 00:19:53.482\nNow let's say it was January, and January,\nso I don't know, maybe the computer\n\n361\n00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:59.029\nwill be smart enough to figure out that\nit's February, February, I don't know.\n\n362\n00:19:59.029 --> 00:20:00.220\nBut let's see.\n\n363\n00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.774\nNow I try to drag that.\n\n364\n00:20:01.774 --> 00:20:05.100\n[SOUND] It's put January\nall the way to the end.\n\n365\n00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.260\nSo that can be useful.\n\n366\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.174\nIt might look like it was not, but let's\njust imagine that I have extracted all\n\n367\n00:20:11.174 --> 00:20:15.230\nthe people who were supposed to work in\nJanuary, and I have listed them out here.\n\n368\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.587\nAnd I want to give them their month.\n\n369\n00:20:17.587 --> 00:20:19.860\nI can simply type January,\nJanuary and then I can drag.\n\n370\n00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.830\nSo I've already created a rhythm or\na pattern for the computer to understand.\n\n371\n00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.390\nSo we can do different things.\n\n372\n00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.240\nYou can just to begin to imagine\nassuming I want the days of the week.\n\n373\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.194\nI wanted alternating numbers.\n\n374\n00:20:32.194 --> 00:20:34.519\nI wanted 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.\n\n375\n00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:38.439\nWhatever it may be, I can create some kind\nof a rhythm, and the computer figures out\n\n376\n00:20:38.439 --> 00:20:42.420\nwhat that is, and there we go,\ncreates all of the them within that range.\n\n377\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.007\n>> It really doesn't.\nThis is one those productivity features\n\n378\n00:20:45.007 --> 00:20:49.260\nthat's built into itself,\nespecially when we see series of things.\n\n379\n00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.530\nThere are certain series that\nExcel has already learned\n\n380\n00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.190\nbecause they are general patterns.\n\n381\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.985\nMonths, days of the week,\nall these things are already set in there.\n\n382\n00:20:57.985 --> 00:21:03.061\nBut you can also end up seeing that it\nrecognizes some universal features like\n\n383\n00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:08.790\nquarter one, quarter two, quarter three,\nquarter four, or Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.\n\n384\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.060\nIt knows that that's actually what\nit's expecting to see as that series.\n\n385\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.080\nLater on, as you get deeper in\nthe learning inside of Excel this way,\n\n386\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.650\nyou'll see where you can actually\ncreate your own pattern to do that.\n\n387\n00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.050\nLet's say that you have what Dr.\n\n388\n00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.300\nTani was talking about,\na list of employees, and you know that\n\n389\n00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.300\nthose are gonna be your only employees\nthat you're gonna actually use everywhere.\n\n390\n00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.070\nYou can start off by listing\ntheir last names and\n\n391\n00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.060\nthen just dragging down, and\nit can actually create that list for\n\n392\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.440\nyou without you having to type in every\nsingle employee's name every single time.\n\n393\n00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.880\nIt is amazing about what Excel can learn\nif you will give it that ability to do so.\n\n394\n00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.692\nSo this really does help in those\nproductivity things when you do\n\n395\n00:21:47.692 --> 00:21:48.323\nhave series.\n\n396\n00:21:48.323 --> 00:21:52.240\nAnd you will see that you'll be\ncreating a lot of series of lists, or\n\n397\n00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.918\nlistings of those types of series because\nit's generally what we do with numbers\n\n398\n00:21:56.918 --> 00:22:00.660\nis that we tend to work with them\nin patterns is what we tend to do.\n\n399\n00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.190\nAnd so this is one of those\nproductivity features.\n\n400\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.090\n>> All right, so\nnow we're going to another label and\n\n401\n00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.620\nsay okay, so what if I want to\nplay around with that table,\n\n402\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.390\nthat text that I've already put\ntogether into columns and rows.\n\n403\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:20.460\nSo what you could do here is,\nI just created my simple document here.\n\n404\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.802\nJust added a little value to it,\nput some color on that-\n\n405\n00:22:23.802 --> 00:22:25.219\n>> The header.\n\n406\n00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:29.263\n>> The heading, like the header there is\nstarting to look a little interesting.\n\n407\n00:22:29.263 --> 00:22:32.853\nAs you can tell, the columns and\nrows are just looking the same, so\n\n408\n00:22:32.853 --> 00:22:35.161\nwe can begin to add value to this table,\nand\n\n409\n00:22:35.161 --> 00:22:38.516\nthere are a lot of other things\nwe can do with that table later.\n\n410\n00:22:38.516 --> 00:22:42.946\nSo let's first of all say, suppose I want\nto add a column right in the middle, or\n\n411\n00:22:42.946 --> 00:22:46.200\na row, or I want to add a cell,\nI want to delete a cell.\n\n412\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.269\nThat means I'm configuring these tables to\nbe a little more flexible and friendly.\n\n413\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.420\nSo over here, if I want to delete\nan entire row, I can just go and\n\n414\n00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.430\npoint right up here at the header.\n\n415\n00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.930\nAnd when I click it,\nit selects the entire row.\n\n416\n00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.838\nAnd then I right-click, and\nI can actually delete it.\n\n417\n00:23:05.838 --> 00:23:10.600\nAssuming I wanted to add something before\nH like a column, so I can right there.\n\n418\n00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:16.910\nD > Right-click > Insert, it inserts for\nme a row, or a column rather.\n\n419\n00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:21.640\nThen I can resize that column if I want,\nright, left.\n\n420\n00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.150\nI can say well,\nI want to insert another row here, and\n\n421\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.670\nI can right-click and\ninsert a row there, all right?\n\n422\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.813\nAnd then, if I wanted to delete it,\nI can just click the whole row, and\n\n423\n00:23:32.813 --> 00:23:33.734\nthen I delete.\n\n424\n00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:38.940\nAnd then, let's say I'm not\nsure I wanted this cell here.\n\n425\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.880\nI can actually delete that cell.\n\n426\n00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.390\nSomething very interesting\nis going to happen.\n\n427\n00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.805\nIf you're deleting a cell, what happens\nto the rest of the text that was\n\n428\n00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:51.058\nin that particular row, or\ncolumn for that matter?\n\n429\n00:23:51.058 --> 00:23:53.449\nSo Excel will ask you simple questions.\n\n430\n00:23:53.449 --> 00:23:56.790\nWell look,\ndo you want to shift everything up?\n\n431\n00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:57.553\nBecause you're not losing.\n\n432\n00:23:57.553 --> 00:24:00.413\nYou only wanted to delete the cell,\nnot the entire column, or\n\n433\n00:24:00.413 --> 00:24:02.600\nyou wanna move things through the right.\n\n434\n00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.220\nWhat do you wanna do?\n\n435\n00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.040\nSo it gives you the various options.\n\n436\n00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:10.670\nSo for me, I'm just speaking a default one\nhere, shift things up and I shift them.\n\n437\n00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.910\nNow you have to be very sure that's\nwhat you wanted to do because,\n\n438\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.450\nas you can tell now, the age of 21 is 18.\n\n439\n00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:21.062\nThe last I checked, I'm actually not 18.\n\n440\n00:24:21.062 --> 00:24:24.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right?\n\n441\n00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.060\nAnd what has happened to the rest of\nthe people is it dramatically shifted\n\n442\n00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.725\ntheir ages.\n\n443\n00:24:28.725 --> 00:24:30.333\nThat could actually not be true.\n\n444\n00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:34.195\nSo you have to be careful about\nwhat you do, if you do it that way.\n\n445\n00:24:34.195 --> 00:24:36.745\nThat's why sometimes moving\nthe entire row, entire column,\n\n446\n00:24:36.745 --> 00:24:41.395\nis easier and a little more accurate.\n\n447\n00:24:41.395 --> 00:24:44.635\nThe likelihood that you\nwill change things and\n\n448\n00:24:44.635 --> 00:24:47.065\ndestruct the whole document is much lower.\n\n449\n00:24:47.065 --> 00:24:48.975\nBut anyway,\nsometimes you might need to do that.\n\n450\n00:24:48.975 --> 00:24:51.415\nSo what I've just done here,\nI've undone the whole thing.\n\n451\n00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.352\nSo now, here you go.\n\n452\n00:24:55.352 --> 00:24:56.260\nYou can do cells.\n\n453\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.190\nYou can do columns.\n\n454\n00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.031\nYou can do rows.\n\n455\n00:24:58.031 --> 00:24:59.640\nYou can add.\n\n456\n00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.450\nRight now, you still haven't made\nthis table very sophisticated but\n\n457\n00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.370\nat least there you go.\n\n458\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.305\nYou can play around with the cells,\ncolumns, and rows.\n\n459\n00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:09.842\n>> In this idea and feature of\nactually deleting the information.\n\n460\n00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:15.640\nThis is where we must be incredibly\ncareful the way that Doctor described it.\n\n461\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.130\nAnd the reason why is that because of the\nway that the information is stored now,\n\n462\n00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.860\nin which all the data\nis related in that row.\n\n463\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.470\nIf you do happen to try and\n\n464\n00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.150\ndelete a single cell,\nyou only have those default options.\n\n465\n00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:33.490\nAnd that means it's gonna pretty\nmuch either shift all the other\n\n466\n00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:38.790\ninformation in that column or that row a\nway that you may not actually understand.\n\n467\n00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.200\nSo before you ever do this,\nverify, and check, and\n\n468\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.510\nensure that you're data\nis exactly what you need.\n\n469\n00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:50.980\nIf you are unsure of this, my\nrecommendation instead is to make a copy\n\n470\n00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.010\nof that worksheet or that workbook and\nname it something else.\n\n471\n00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.120\nAnd then try and delete it from there and\n\n472\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.960\nsee if that result actually\ngives you what you want.\n\n473\n00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.890\nIf not, do not do it on your data that\nis actually in use for your company.\n\n474\n00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:12.210\nBecause by shifting just one row of data,\nor\n\n475\n00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.010\nthat one cell of data, or\nthat one column of data up just one row.\n\n476\n00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:21.902\nYou could really have data that no\nlonger means anything to your company.\n\n477\n00:26:21.902 --> 00:26:26.603\nWhich now means it's useless to you\nbecause it's no longer reporting accurate\n\n478\n00:26:26.603 --> 00:26:27.522\ninformation.\n\n479\n00:26:27.522 --> 00:26:29.675\nBut there are times you need to do so, so\n\n480\n00:26:29.675 --> 00:26:33.120\nyou want to be very careful\nabout this particular tool.\n\n481\n00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.570\nIt is one of the things that if you,\nit can really mess up\n\n482\n00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:42.010\ninformation very badly so\nbe very careful, but it is a useful tool.\n\n483\n00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.720\nAs long as you remember, columns,\n\n484\n00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.560\nall the information are stored in\nthat particular row is interrelated.\n\n485\n00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.200\nAnd then those columns, if you shift\nstuff up, it's gonna break those column\n\n486\n00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.760\nrelationships, as far as the logical\nrelationship of the data in-between them.\n\n487\n00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.110\nSo be very careful here.\n\n488\n00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.100\nIt's a strict warning,\nit's an over emphasized warning, but\n\n489\n00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:04.600\nit is necessary cuz you do not want\nto break somebody else's data.\n\n490\n00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.700\nIt is very much not something ever\nthat you want somebody to say,\n\n491\n00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.300\nwell, the data's meaningless anymore.\n\n492\n00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.337\n>> All right, so\nwe're gonna do is just two more things.\n\n493\n00:27:14.337 --> 00:27:17.600\nBecause our show's a little bit\nin terms of amount of Time.\n\n494\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.197\nWe're gonna do two more things, and then\nwe can wrap up in this particular show.\n\n495\n00:27:21.197 --> 00:27:26.340\nI've just created additional\nrow at the top of my table.\n\n496\n00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.969\nMaybe I'll just do two.\n\n497\n00:27:27.969 --> 00:27:30.910\nSo I've inserted,\nnow we've got two additional rows.\n\n498\n00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.360\nSo let's say that this table\nneeded to have a title.\n\n499\n00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.270\nAnd then my boss told me that\nthe title is supposed to be Students\n\n500\n00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.660\nwho did not show up.\n\n501\n00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.940\nSo I go like, okay,\nStudents who did not show up.\n\n502\n00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.130\nNow, if I select that particular cell and\n\n503\n00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:53.870\nI look at the formula bar,\nthe whole text is there.\n\n504\n00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.936\nBut as I can tell, that text is kind\nof overlapping into another cell.\n\n505\n00:27:57.936 --> 00:28:03.950\nOne way to handle this is that I\ncan actually widen that column.\n\n506\n00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.990\nAnd then there we go, so\nit's not overlapping.\n\n507\n00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.860\nBut again, I've lost the format of this.\n\n508\n00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.210\nIt's doesn't look like it's really nice.\n\n509\n00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.960\nI wish all the columns were\napproximately the same size.\n\n510\n00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.020\nSo let me undo that, and\n\n511\n00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:19.880\nthen I'm now introducing a new function\nwhere I can actually merge cells.\n\n512\n00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.830\nSo if I select this cell and drop to the\nright, I've actually selected two cells.\n\n513\n00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:28.080\nAnd I go up there,\nthere is an opportunity to merge cells.\n\n514\n00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.990\nOf course, you can do right-click here and\n\n515\n00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:33.840\nthen you can try to figure out how\nto merge through the format cells.\n\n516\n00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.070\nBut now let me merge those two cells.\n\n517\n00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.820\nSo there we go, I've merged the two cells.\n\n518\n00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.452\nBut as I think about it,\n\n519\n00:28:39.452 --> 00:28:43.600\nit's still not very well balanced,\nor symmetrical for that matter.\n\n520\n00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.930\nSo one way to do it is to select the\nentire set of cells from the beginning to\n\n521\n00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.020\nthe end and then I merge.\n\n522\n00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.290\nAnd that means I have several options.\n\n523\n00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:57.880\nI can merge and center align it,\nmerge across, merge self.\n\n524\n00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.050\nNow I want to merge and center align.\n\n525\n00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.220\nSo, there we go.\n\n526\n00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:06.520\nMy text is now symmetrically center\naligned and it's balances left and right.\n\n527\n00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.980\nSo now I have a title for my table.\n\n528\n00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.727\nAnd maybe, if I was in the right mood,\n\n529\n00:29:10.727 --> 00:29:12.923\nI can actually put some\nlittle color around it.\n\n530\n00:29:12.923 --> 00:29:16.296\nAnd say, okay, fine,\nit's gonna be something like grey, and\n\n531\n00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:18.620\nthen I could possibly make it bold.\n\n532\n00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.550\nNow what I'm doing here is I'm actually\nusing some of the menu functions\n\n533\n00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:26.150\nthat we figured out in the previous\nexperience of Microsoft One.\n\n534\n00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.630\nAnd that's why we spend some time to\nthink about the generic things there.\n\n535\n00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.530\nSo now we have center aligned, some title.\n\n536\n00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:39.900\nAnd sometimes maybe the text can be so\nlong that it doesn't even fit.\n\n537\n00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.010\nSo maybe I say, I put in bracket,\n\n538\n00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.930\nmy boss told me you need to say which\nyear, which month, thing like that.\n\n539\n00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.530\nSo let's hypothetically say I\nhave a little more text here, and\n\n540\n00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.430\nit has now become longer than the space.\n\n541\n00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.238\nI don't want it to spill\nover to the right.\n\n542\n00:29:56.238 --> 00:30:01.730\nBecause if I move and point elsewhere,\nsome of that text is hidden.\n\n543\n00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.674\nI don't want to start\nwidening those columns.\n\n544\n00:30:04.674 --> 00:30:09.890\nWhat I could possibly do is I can actually\nselect that text and drop that text.\n\n545\n00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:14.850\nWhat that, basically, does is it\ncreates a new row within the cell.\n\n546\n00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.630\nNow, right now, it's not visible, but\n\n547\n00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.480\nif I actually increase the height\nof that cell, the text now appears.\n\n548\n00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.540\nThen, wow, there I am.\n\n549\n00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.720\nI now have something in brackets and\nthe table now looks reasonable.\n\n550\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.010\nIt's well balanced and\nI can do more things with this.\n\n551\n00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.780\nSo looking at that whole section up there.\n\n552\n00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.780\nWe've talked a little about wrapping and\nmerging cells, and\n\n553\n00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.500\nyou can do that center aligning.\n\n554\n00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:44.810\nAnd the beautiful thing about tables, and\nExcel in particular, you just don't do\n\n555\n00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:49.020\ncenter aligning to the center vertically\nonly, and to the right and to the left.\n\n556\n00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.970\nYou can also do for the entire cell,\nupwards and downwards.\n\n557\n00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:56.740\nSo you can actually align to the top, or\nto the bottom, to the right, to the left,\n\n558\n00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.200\nto the right of the center.\n\n559\n00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.990\nAll those options exist.\n\n560\n00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.410\nAnd I hope this is a useful function,\nbecause now we're gonna close for\n\n561\n00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:04.390\nthis session.\n\n562\n00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:09.140\nAnd I hope that you can create some\nsimple tables around and play with them.\n\n563\n00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.610\n>> There's no doubt that these functions\nthat we're seeing, that merge and center.\n\n564\n00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:17.569\nReally does help set off that particular\ntype of data as something that people\n\n565\n00:31:17.569 --> 00:31:19.280\nwanna focus in on.\n\n566\n00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.840\nYou may have lots of information, but you\nmay want somebody to focus in, let say for\n\n567\n00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.150\nthe example here,\nsales only in the month of August.\n\n568\n00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:32.050\nAnd even though you might have the entire\nyear's of data on that one worksheet.\n\n569\n00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.940\nYou may go ahead and create that\nwhere you merge, and center, and\n\n570\n00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.170\ngive that particular section a title.\n\n571\n00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:41.590\nAnd that way it looks like it's broken\nup into a logical section for you.\n\n572\n00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.410\nAnd doing that merge and\ncenter really does help.\n\n573\n00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:47.310\nBecause it helps to set and distinguish\nitself from all the other figures\n\n574\n00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.650\nthat you may have set up there as well.\n\n575\n00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:53.530\nWell, this actually does give us at\nleast a great starting point for\n\n576\n00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.000\nwhat we need to understand when\nwe start to work with Excel.\n\n577\n00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.490\nBut there is plenty more to go and so,\nDoctor that means we're coming back for\n\n578\n00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:01.390\na part two, right?\n\n579\n00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.070\n>> Yeah.\nWe're gonna come back for part two.\n\n580\n00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.590\n>> All right.\n\n581\n00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.322\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n582\n00:32:06.322 --> 00:32:08.190\nSigning off for ITPro TV.\n\n583\n00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.750\nI've been your host, Ronny Wong.\n\n584\n00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.320\n>> And right here,\nenjoying learning together.\n\n585\n00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.699\n>> All right, stay tuned right here for\nmore computing fundamentals.\n\n586\n00:32:18.699 --> 00:32:24.019\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.920\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.049\nyou're watching\nthe Computing Fundamentals IC3 show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:24.835\nNow we are actually in the middle of\ntaking a look at introducing ourselves to,\n\n6\n00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:27.314\nof course, Microsoft Excel 2010.\n\n7\n00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:31.490\nAnd we've already gone through several\ndifferent features in terms of navigating,\n\n8\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.990\nand actually seeing how\nwe can enter in data.\n\n9\n00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.165\nBut we've got a lot more to go, and\nhere to help us out is Dr. Tonny Omwansa.\n\n10\n00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:39.910\nDr. Tonny, welcome back to our studios.\n\n11\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.500\n>> Thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.130\nIt's always great being here,\nand learning together.\n\n13\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.920\nIt's lots of fun!\n\n14\n00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.366\nYou know, learning doesn't have to be\nreally hard work and really serious.\n\n15\n00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.700\nOf course it's a serious work, but\n\n16\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.712\nthen there's also fun in it, and that's\nwhat we are having a good time here.\n\n17\n00:00:54.712 --> 00:00:57.420\n>> All right, so we've already\ntaken a look at several different\n\n18\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.180\nfeatures inside of Excel that we really\ndo need to understand and master.\n\n19\n00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.323\nBut taking a look at numbers is one of\nthose things that can start to blur after\n\n20\n00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:05.858\na while.\n\n21\n00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:09.700\nEspecially when you start seeing columns\nand rows of numbers all the time.\n\n22\n00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.220\nAnd those numbers are actually meaningful\nin the very fact that we can attach\n\n23\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.980\ndifferent formatting to them, and\n\n24\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.350\nthat's what we want to take a look\nat in this particular episode.\n\n25\n00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.695\nAnd where we begin is the idea of\ntalking about numbering format.\n\n26\n00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:24.860\nDr. Tonny, how important is this?\n\n27\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.750\n>> This is very important, this is very\nimportant, because Excel is about numbers.\n\n28\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.100\nThere's a lot to do with numbers in Excel.\n\n29\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.642\nPutting things in columns and\ncompacting them in different ways,\n\n30\n00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:40.465\nyou know, Excel sheets,\ncharts, whatever it may be.\n\n31\n00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:42.130\nBut numbers is important.\n\n32\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.290\nAnd we're trying to communicate\nthese numbers to someone else.\n\n33\n00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.610\nYou have different types of numbers.\n\n34\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.110\nData can be the date, so\nthat's some form of a number.\n\n35\n00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.080\nIt has a month and a date here.\n\n36\n00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.470\nWe can have currency,\nyou know, say I have money and\n\n37\n00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.230\nthat currency can be of different type.\n\n38\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.240\nI can have US dollars,\nCanadian shillings, South African rands or\n\n39\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.130\nCanadian, is it dollars?\n\n40\n00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.790\n>> Dollars.\n>> Yes, correct, yeah?\n\n41\n00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.050\nAnd British pounds, whatever.\n\n42\n00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.190\nSo all those different kinds of numbers,\nand things can be in percentages,\n\n43\n00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.500\nor they can be in ratios, or\nthey can have decimal numbers.\n\n44\n00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.450\nAnd the decimals could be two decimal\npoints, three decimal points, etcetera.\n\n45\n00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.750\nSo the different things that we have to\nappreciate, that when we communicate this\n\n46\n00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.200\ndata to other people, it must be accurate,\nit must be represented appropriately.\n\n47\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.030\nSo we're gonna spend a little bit of time\nthinking about how do we organize that\n\n48\n00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.420\ndata so that it is accurate.\n\n49\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.975\nNow, let's go back to\nmy interesting table.\n\n50\n00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:43.560\n[LAUGH]\nSo\n\n51\n00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.260\nI just want to change a little bit here,\nso\n\n52\n00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.140\nthis is fsd doesn't sound like I wasn't\nthinking too much about what I was doing.\n\n53\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.930\nSo our title now becomes students\nwho did not show up month or year.\n\n54\n00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.337\nLet's just say year, 2015.\n\n55\n00:03:03.337 --> 00:03:04.720\nSo something like that, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.580\nNowadays we only need for wrapping our\ntext because it fits within one row.\n\n57\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.370\nNow look at my text here on a Age.\n\n58\n00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.480\nOf course it's not really correct,\nI don't think somebody was 100 years,\n\n59\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.830\nlet me change this column and\nlet's call it Debts.\n\n60\n00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.455\nSo let's say some students\nowe us some money, all right?\n\n61\n00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:30.265\nAnd then this amount here is\nsupposed to be in some currency.\n\n62\n00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:37.241\nAnd in some cases people owe not\nexactly 100, they probably owed 100.25.\n\n63\n00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:39.810\nSo we need to be able to reflect that.\n\n64\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.930\nIf I right-click this cell and\nlook at format cell,\n\n65\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.860\nI have several options of the how\nthe number can be represented.\n\n66\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.190\nIt could be just a typical number,\nwith decimal places,\n\n67\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.720\nwhere it's general it\ndoesn't have decimal places.\n\n68\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.769\nWhen it's number,\nit could have decimal places,\n\n69\n00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.540\nso over here there's a sample of\nexactly how it's gonna look like.\n\n70\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.960\nSo I could do three decimal places,\ntwo decimal places, one decimal place.\n\n71\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.530\nIt could be a currency and if it's\na currency, it could have a symbol.\n\n72\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.590\nSo we could easily have\nwhatever symbol here and\n\n73\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.260\nthere are several symbols\nthat have been included here.\n\n74\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.920\nWe could have, the way we represent\nsome people would say if it's negative,\n\n75\n00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.730\nthat means all money it could be negative,\nor\n\n76\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.170\nit could be bracket to represent its\na debt or you owe someone some money.\n\n77\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.980\nIf we go to the Accounting option,\nit has a dollar sign here.\n\n78\n00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.260\nWe could change that dollar\nsign to something else, and\n\n79\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.400\nthe decimal places as well can be changed.\n\n80\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.180\nIf it's a date, we have different\nways of representing a date.\n\n81\n00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.820\nWe could have just the month,\nthen the year, I mean,\n\n82\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.710\nthe month, the date, then the year.\n\n83\n00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.560\nI could actually, the whole day\ncould be full, like Wednesday,\n\n84\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.200\nor we could just have the month and the\ndate, or it could actually be whatever.\n\n85\n00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.570\nThere's so many formats here.\n\n86\n00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.900\nAnd some of the formats associated\nwith certain backgrounds.\n\n87\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.740\nFor example, if it is English Philippines,\n\n88\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.590\nthey've got a certain way\nthey represent the date.\n\n89\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.590\nSo you can quickly select, well I just\nwant a format, which is English US, or\n\n90\n00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.670\nI want French Belgium, and\nthey have their own formats.\n\n91\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.150\nSo that gives you an opportunity to select\ndifferent ways of presenting the date.\n\n92\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.140\nThink about time.\n\n93\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.820\nTime can be represented as the hour,\nthe minute, and\n\n94\n00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.580\nthe second, or just the hour and\nminute, so depending on what you want.\n\n95\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.810\nPercentages as well,\nfractions, scientific.\n\n96\n00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.700\nThink about scientific.\n\n97\n00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.430\nIt can be a long, long number of decimal\nplaces because we care about very, very,\n\n98\n00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.410\nvery high level of regularity.\n\n99\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.820\nIt could be just simple text.\n\n100\n00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.080\nIt could be special format, where we can\nactually create our own kind of format.\n\n101\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.770\nAnd the custom format\nwhere we can actually\n\n102\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.810\nalso create some guidelines of how\nthat particular text is going to look.\n\n103\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.490\nSo for purposes of my example,\nlet me just speak currency.\n\n104\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.449\nAnd I say, let me look for\nsome currency over here.\n\n105\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.440\nYeah, one country I've never\nbeen in my life is which one.\n\n106\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.560\nI've not been to Somalia,\nbut lets just pick Tsonga.\n\n107\n00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.520\nOkay, I've never been there.\n\n108\n00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.380\nI look forward to being there.\n\n109\n00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.610\nSo it seems like it has r, and\nas far as I recall, runs probably.\n\n110\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.410\nAnd then if I want anything\nnegative I'll pick,\n\n111\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.100\nif it's adept I'll say negative instead\nof a bracket and then there I go.\n\n112\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.018\nSo my text now,\nmy 100 now reads 100 runs, 0.0.\n\n113\n00:06:35.018 --> 00:06:38.175\nSo let's say I wanted to\ninclude decimal places for now.\n\n114\n00:06:38.175 --> 00:06:42.055\nSo I have an option here that\nI could actually increase\n\n115\n00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:45.145\nmy decimal places directly here.\n\n116\n00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:48.965\nAnd then I just think that all\nthese texts should read like that,\n\n117\n00:06:48.965 --> 00:06:52.720\nso I'm gonna click at\nthe corner of that cell.\n\n118\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.830\nHold down, and\nthen I drag down to the end.\n\n119\n00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.440\nSo what has happened?\n\n120\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.990\nWe talked about the fonts\nsome time before.\n\n121\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.470\nI mean, the format some time before,\nwhen we are selecting.\n\n122\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.600\nNow what has basically happened there is\nit's changed everything to 100 rounds.\n\n123\n00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.810\nMaybe that's not what I wanted,\nmaybe that's what I wanted, that's okay.\n\n124\n00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.690\nBut assuming that I want to go\nback to every amount there,\n\n125\n00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.830\nlet it be correct, but I just change\nit to runs, and two decimal places.\n\n126\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.515\nSo I undo, I select my whole text now\nwithout clicking to the right corner,\n\n127\n00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:25.552\nbecause when you're clicking to the right\ncorner and holding down and dragging,\n\n128\n00:07:25.552 --> 00:07:27.267\nyou're basically overwriting.\n\n129\n00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:31.400\nSo I'm gonna click somewhere in\nthe center, and I just drag down.\n\n130\n00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.800\nAnd then I right-click, and\nI go to my format and say well,\n\n131\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.270\nI want everything in currency and\nnegative two decimal places.\n\n132\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.280\nI don't have a symbol,\nlet's open the symbol, and I say okay, so\n\n133\n00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.520\nnow everything has been changed.\n\n134\n00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.670\nAnd all of a sudden,\nI have represented my data correctly.\n\n135\n00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.930\nBut this is debt, it's about money.\n\n136\n00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.946\nAnd maybe, if I'm interested in\nputting the currency, the title label,\n\n137\n00:07:56.946 --> 00:08:00.858\nI can put a bracket there and\nsay, ten shillings or rands.\n\n138\n00:08:00.858 --> 00:08:02.438\nOkay, so I put in bracket, Enter.\n\n139\n00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:07.690\nSo then everybody knows that the whole\namount is dealing with rands.\n\n140\n00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.470\nIs that useful, sir?\n\n141\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.900\n>> It definitely is.\n\n142\n00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.940\nDepending on what you're doing,\nthe numbers can actually look the same,\n\n143\n00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.620\nand the problem with leaving\nthe number is essentially not formatted\n\n144\n00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.070\nin the proper way.\n\n145\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.730\nWhether it's currency or\njust common numbers or\n\n146\n00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.960\nanything is that nobody knows\nwhat those values actually mean.\n\n147\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.700\nSo instead, when somebody does have\nthis figure, if you're like me and\n\n148\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.671\nyou're here in the United States,\nwell I might assume that what Dr.\n\n149\n00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:35.920\nOmwansa was talking about was US dollars.\n\n150\n00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.498\nAnd then when I say it's gonna\ncost me how much and Dr.\n\n151\n00:08:38.498 --> 00:08:41.381\nOmwansa says so no this is,\nwhich one did you pick, rands?\n\n152\n00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:42.782\n>> It was rands, yes.\n\n153\n00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:45.090\n>> Well then I know that\nthere's something different.\n\n154\n00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.130\nI cannot automatically assume that and\nthen make wrong decisions based on that.\n\n155\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.460\nAll this is about taking those numbers and\nputting it into the proper format so\n\n156\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.400\nthat proper decisions can be made based\non the information that you're given.\n\n157\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.810\nIt would be a very bad, bad assumption for\nme to say, no, you're talking about\n\n158\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.640\nUS dollars as I look at those figures and\nDr. Tonney goes, no this is not it.\n\n159\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.580\nAnd so he may make a different\ndecision based on the currency and so\n\n160\n00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.212\nwe definitely wanna make sure that we\nare formatting those numbers properly.\n\n161\n00:09:15.212 --> 00:09:18.810\nSo that people don't have questions like\nthat about our numbers, that our numbers\n\n162\n00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.140\nactually provide the meaning exactly the\nway that we want that meaning to show up.\n\n163\n00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.830\nSo this number formatting\nis a very important thing,\n\n164\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.970\nwhether you are actually doing it for\ncurrency or the proper date.\n\n165\n00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.110\nRemember that around the world,\nthe date is gonna be reported differently.\n\n166\n00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.385\nAnd who are you taking that document to?\n\n167\n00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:39.330\nIn other words, who is that Excel\nspreadsheet or workbook for?\n\n168\n00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.180\nIs it for someone that I'm actually going\nto be, in other words working here?\n\n169\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.250\nOr is it for somebody working around\nthe world in which the date format may not\n\n170\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.910\nactually match up to what\nthey're used to seeing.\n\n171\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.250\nAnd they make a bad assumption about that.\n\n172\n00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.120\nSo we wanna always make sure\nthat we properly format it for\n\n173\n00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.260\nthe audience that we're gonna be\npresenting this to because that is the key\n\n174\n00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.500\nso that they can make decisions that\nthey need to based on the proper data.\n\n175\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.690\n>> Great, now we're just about to go\ninto another level of formulas, and\n\n176\n00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.720\ntrying to create figures here and there,\nand trying to create new competition.\n\n177\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.070\nBut before we go there, we're gonna spend\na little moment thinking about, how do we\n\n178\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.720\nnow format this whole table, assuming\nwe're gonna give it to someone else?\n\n179\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.490\nI wanna print it,\nI want it to look in a certain way.\n\n180\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.940\nSo let me just demonstrate, for example,\nthis simple page that we've created.\n\n181\n00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.072\nHow would it look like if\nwe sent it to a printer?\n\n182\n00:10:32.072 --> 00:10:37.373\nIf I go to File, and then I go Print,\non my right here is just a display\n\n183\n00:10:37.373 --> 00:10:42.408\nof how that document would look\nlike if we sent it to the printer.\n\n184\n00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:45.455\nWell, depends on what exactly you want it.\n\n185\n00:10:45.455 --> 00:10:48.090\nSay it's a draft,\nwe could easily send, that's okay.\n\n186\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.780\nBut assuming we want to make\nsomething really presentable so\n\n187\n00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.930\nthat when someone looks at it they say\nwell, some thought went into this.\n\n188\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.940\nSo what I'm going to do is that\nI'm going to create columns and\n\n189\n00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.200\nmake sure they are very clear.\n\n190\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.550\nYeah there are existing columns,\nthere are no borders for\n\n191\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.426\nthe entire table and for the cells, so\nsometimes it might not look very clear.\n\n192\n00:11:07.426 --> 00:11:13.688\nSo what we're gonna do is, I'm going to\nselect the entire table that has my data.\n\n193\n00:11:13.688 --> 00:11:16.539\nAnd then after selecting it,\n\n194\n00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:22.361\nI can come up here to a section\non font and I click All Borders.\n\n195\n00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:25.679\nSo what will happen is that\nthe table now has a set of borders,\n\n196\n00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:27.906\nit's kind of looking a little sharper.\n\n197\n00:11:27.906 --> 00:11:30.828\nI can see things running across, yeah.\n\n198\n00:11:30.828 --> 00:11:35.925\nAnd then if I want, maybe I didn't want\nall the borders to look like that.\n\n199\n00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:39.695\nSo maybe I can undo and\nthen as I've selected that, I can say,\n\n200\n00:11:39.695 --> 00:11:43.195\nwell maybe I'm interested in\nthe overall border, outside.\n\n201\n00:11:43.195 --> 00:11:48.155\nI'm not interested in the inner part,\nso that also creates the border outside.\n\n202\n00:11:48.155 --> 00:11:50.805\nAnd if I go and look at my Print option,\n\n203\n00:11:50.805 --> 00:11:53.515\nthis is how it would look like\nif I sent it to the printer.\n\n204\n00:11:53.515 --> 00:11:57.215\nSo there are many ways I can play around\nwith, maybe I'm more interested in\n\n205\n00:11:57.215 --> 00:12:01.950\nsome total, so let's say I put a total\nhere and I'm interested in a sum.\n\n206\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:06.200\nWe'll come later on to discuss\nhow to do that summation, but\n\n207\n00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.620\nfor now I've just done a total.\n\n208\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.230\nAnd then, because I want this row\nto look a little more interesting,\n\n209\n00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.652\nI go to the borders and\nI click All Borders for that section.\n\n210\n00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:20.050\nAll right, and\nthen I want this to look a little bold and\n\n211\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.580\nI want this to look a little bold.\n\n212\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.500\nOkay, so maybe that's what I wanted to do.\n\n213\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.070\nI mean, it depends on what you want to do.\n\n214\n00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.290\nSo there are many things\nyou can do with a table.\n\n215\n00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.990\nI can create the cells to\nhave their own borders.\n\n216\n00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.680\nI can create the entire, or\nI can say I want this particular column,\n\n217\n00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.590\nonly this particular\ncolumn to have borders.\n\n218\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.570\nSo I can go, and\nthen I select my borders to the right.\n\n219\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.990\nSo there we go, all borders for\nthat particular one, what ever you want.\n\n220\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.480\nBut maybe at the end of the day, for\n\n221\n00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.810\nme, what I think would look nice now\nis that I can select all borders.\n\n222\n00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.440\nAnd then I can make my last\nrow over here just to be,\n\n223\n00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.230\nmaybe a slightly different color,\nso something like that.\n\n224\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.200\nAnd now I have some kind of\na little more interesting table.\n\n225\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.088\nAnd then I can send this to\na printer if I wanted and\n\n226\n00:13:07.088 --> 00:13:09.820\nthat's basically how it would look like.\n\n227\n00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.699\nSo I hope that this is useful in\nmaking the presentation look nice.\n\n228\n00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:17.721\nIf you wanted, you can remove\na particular border of a cell.\n\n229\n00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:20.600\nYou are not obliged to have\nall the cells to have borders.\n\n230\n00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.085\nSo you can click one, you can go to the\nformat cells, or you can come up here and\n\n231\n00:13:25.085 --> 00:13:28.612\nplay around with it and\nthen it'll look a little different.\n\n232\n00:13:28.612 --> 00:13:29.788\nHow is that, Ronnie?\n\n233\n00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:33.674\n>> The presentation of data is one of the\nmost important things that we can do to\n\n234\n00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:36.895\nhelp set off logically what\nwe want people to see.\n\n235\n00:13:36.895 --> 00:13:40.195\nEyes will wander across a lot\nof data very immediately.\n\n236\n00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:43.525\nBut if we want to draw the attention,\nsetting it off in a table,\n\n237\n00:13:43.525 --> 00:13:45.855\napplying just a little bit of formatting,\n\n238\n00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:50.010\nreally draws the eye to the attention of\nwhat you really want to point out there.\n\n239\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.900\nAnd allows them to focus in on that while\nyou do the explanation that you need to.\n\n240\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.060\nWithout it,\ncan you still do the same thing?\n\n241\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.620\nDefinitely, but\nit now relies on your skills as an orator.\n\n242\n00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.944\nIt relies on your skills at actually being\nable to make the point that you need to.\n\n243\n00:14:03.944 --> 00:14:08.706\nWhereas this simply enhances that ability\nwithout you having to go overly dramatic\n\n244\n00:14:08.706 --> 00:14:11.510\nin what you need to do to make that point.\n\n245\n00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.300\nNow along with this, right,\n\n246\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.870\nyou have of course several other things\nthat we can actually take a look at.\n\n247\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.524\nSo what are we actually taking\na look at next here, Dr. Tonny?\n\n248\n00:14:19.524 --> 00:14:24.140\n>> Okay, now, what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna spend a little bit of time\n\n249\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.682\nthinking about formulas, thinking\nabout how we could aggregate data,\n\n250\n00:14:28.682 --> 00:14:32.258\nhow could we relate data,\nso that we get more value?\n\n251\n00:14:32.258 --> 00:14:35.820\nBecause, normally, when you have row data,\nit may not make a lot of sense,\n\n252\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.860\nin some cases.\n\n253\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.310\nBut, then, when you play around with\nthe combined figures, here and there,\n\n254\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.040\nit starts to generate very\ninteresting findings.\n\n255\n00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.131\nSo, let's go to our table.\n\n256\n00:14:47.131 --> 00:14:52.242\nAnd I created a total here so\ntoday I'm just gonna remove that total.\n\n257\n00:14:52.242 --> 00:14:56.614\nSo we're gonna go back a little bit and\n\n258\n00:14:56.614 --> 00:15:00.313\nreflect on how did we get there.\n\n259\n00:15:00.313 --> 00:15:03.460\nWe spoke about the formula\nbar awhile back.\n\n260\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.520\nAnd formula bar gives us\nan opportunity to create a formula.\n\n261\n00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.240\nSo let's say I want to get the sum total\n\n262\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.480\nof the amount of money that\nthese people owe us, all right?\n\n263\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.050\nAnd I also learned how to do selection.\n\n264\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:23.880\nNow, the cell that I want the sum total to\ncome to is the one I'm going to point to.\n\n265\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.300\nSo just simply put,\nI'm gonna say equals too.\n\n266\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.360\nJust to simply illustrate and\nthen I'm going to come and\n\n267\n00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.320\nclick this cell, the first cell.\n\n268\n00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:41.005\nAnd you can see it picked D4 and\nthen I'm going to say plus\n\n269\n00:15:41.005 --> 00:15:47.181\nthe second cell plus the third cell,\nI think I made a mistake.\n\n270\n00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:54.104\nAll right, so B2 plus the third cell,\nplus the fourth cell,\n\n271\n00:15:54.104 --> 00:15:58.898\nplus the fifth cell, plus the sixth cell,\n\n272\n00:15:58.898 --> 00:16:04.776\nplus the seventh cell Plus 8,\nplus 9, plus 10.\n\n273\n00:16:04.776 --> 00:16:05.612\nI'm done.\n\n274\n00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:06.112\nEnter.\n\n275\n00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.105\nIt generated for\nme the sum of all these numbers.\n\n276\n00:16:11.105 --> 00:16:16.469\nAnd if I point at it, look at\nthe formula bar, it has the entire sum.\n\n277\n00:16:16.469 --> 00:16:20.720\nThat's a very simple example\nof how I could add things up.\n\n278\n00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.560\nSo, this normally approach is useful if\nI had figures spread out in different\n\n279\n00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.100\nplaces and it's a little\ndifficult to get the pattern.\n\n280\n00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.330\nSo what I will do is that I will just say,\nI'm gonna put the formula here.\n\n281\n00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.200\nSo I put the equals sign and\nthen from there,\n\n282\n00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.160\nI can pick whatever I want to pick and\nclick, my new value generated.\n\n283\n00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160\nBut of course, that's not necessarily\nthe simplest way to do it.\n\n284\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.220\nSo it depends on the circumstances.\n\n285\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.870\nSo if I undo this formula,\nso now I don't have it.\n\n286\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:52.435\nAnd then select the entire text and\ndrag to the end, and\n\n287\n00:16:52.435 --> 00:16:56.586\nreached that particular cell and\ngo up here and\n\n288\n00:16:56.586 --> 00:17:00.230\nsay order sum and click my order sum.\n\n289\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.800\nNow I have the same total,\nbut in a much faster way.\n\n290\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.150\nIf I click this cell,\nnow the formula has changed.\n\n291\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:13.080\nIt is sum D1 through D14,\nit automatically selects the entire cell.\n\n292\n00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.530\nI can come here and change this.\n\n293\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.269\nI didn't want the last row,\nI could say D12.\n\n294\n00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:19.680\nSo, it means it's less one.\n\n295\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.530\nAll right?\n\n296\n00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:21.920\nMaybe that's not very useful, but\n\n297\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.400\nat least it gives you an idea where you\ncan actually play around with that.\n\n298\n00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.650\nNow think about it.\n\n299\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.300\nLet's go to this sum and\nlook at some options that exist.\n\n300\n00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.140\nYou can do an average.\n\n301\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.120\nYou can do count of numbers.\n\n302\n00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.290\nThe count of numbers is simply going to\ntell me how many numbers were in that\n\n303\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.190\nwhole column.\n\n304\n00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.570\nI can get the max.\n\n305\n00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.900\nI want to know what was the largest\namount that we are owed.\n\n306\n00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.360\nMaybe the person who owes us the largest\n\n307\n00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.350\nis actually more than the sum\ntotal of everybody else.\n\n308\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.060\nSo I should just focus on\nthat person first before\n\n309\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.130\nI even think about everybody else.\n\n310\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.280\nOr I want to know the minimum.\n\n311\n00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.920\nMaybe I just want to forgive someone.\n\n312\n00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.030\nLook, that's so small.\n\n313\n00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.200\nWe're just sending this student away from\nschool and he just owes a little money.\n\n314\n00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.300\nSo I can use these kind of options\nto play around with the numbers.\n\n315\n00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.760\nThere are more functions than you can\nactually identify, and that's fine.\n\n316\n00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.990\nThere are formulas you\ncreate generic formulas.\n\n317\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.110\nIt can come in and say,\nI want the sum of this and that,\n\n318\n00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:21.090\nI want the mean of this, plus,\nso let us say I'm interested in.\n\n319\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.469\nI've already created a sum of all this.\n\n320\n00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:30.541\nAnd then, I just realized, last year,\nwe were owed actually an amount as well,\n\n321\n00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:36.250\nwhich was, I think 200,000,\n200 for that matter.\n\n322\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.239\nWe were owed that much.\n\n323\n00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:41.442\nNow, what is the ratio of the amount\nwe are owed now to the amount we were\n\n324\n00:18:41.442 --> 00:18:42.670\nowed last year?\n\n325\n00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:47.080\nIt's a function of it, okay fine, so let's\nsee, is it like are we going up or down?\n\n326\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.690\nSo I say I want to put\nthat new value here.\n\n327\n00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:55.410\nSo I say equals to this divide by this.\n\n328\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.801\nAnd my formula is right up there, Enter.\n\n329\n00:18:57.801 --> 00:19:04.511\nSo now, what we were owed last year is\n0.32 of what we are owed this year.\n\n330\n00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:06.940\nSo now I'm starting to get\ninformation out of data.\n\n331\n00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.170\nThese figures were not there.\n\n332\n00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.830\nI'm just creating them using formulas.\n\n333\n00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.880\nI really wanna hope that this is exciting.\n\n334\n00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.340\nOf course it sounds a little\nchallenging and kind of complex.\n\n335\n00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:21.040\nBut what it simply tells us is\nthat we can create new value\n\n336\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.970\nout of data that already exists.\n\n337\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.230\nAnd that value can be very powerful.\n\n338\n00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.064\nI hope you like that.\n\n339\n00:19:28.064 --> 00:19:30.142\nI hope your appreciate the value of that.\n\n340\n00:19:30.142 --> 00:19:32.115\n>> Right, when you start seeing it,\n\n341\n00:19:32.115 --> 00:19:37.600\nformulas are definitely where you're gonna\nfind the most value in what Excel can do.\n\n342\n00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.920\nThere's lot of times those\neither a great math,\n\n343\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.020\nyou probably go out I don't\nknow if I really need that.\n\n344\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.730\nIt's not so much of about a need as\nmuch as it is about a process that\n\n345\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:52.190\nmakes it easy for everybody to do\nthe mathematics that needs to be done.\n\n346\n00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.070\nWhat Doctor Tony showed us\nin the auto sum button.\n\n347\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.000\nEssentially, all of those\nare different types of aggregates.\n\n348\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.220\nWhether you're averaging something,\nor whether you're doing the max or\n\n349\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.600\nthe minimum, or whether actually\ndoing the total of something,\n\n350\n00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.340\nthey all take a bunch of different\nnumbers and give us a single result.\n\n351\n00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.255\nSo those are all aggregate values.\n\n352\n00:20:10.255 --> 00:20:13.463\nAnd then he showed us that there\nare other functions that also exist, and\n\n353\n00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:17.170\ninside of Excel, there's plenty of\ndifferent functions inside of there.\n\n354\n00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.460\nAnd for those of you that go on to master\njust these types of simple formulas\n\n355\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.280\nthat we're using in the functions, It's\nreally gonna help you out in the future.\n\n356\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.110\nIt always has to begin somewhere.\n\n357\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.770\nSo us understanding the very basics of how\na formula is created, and the key here\n\n358\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:36.360\nis remembering that an equal sign\nalways has to come first in a formula.\n\n359\n00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.000\nAnd then from that point, you can select\nthe cells of the data that you want to\n\n360\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.490\nadd in there, and then do whatever\nfunction that you want to actually have\n\n361\n00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.750\non those particular cells as well.\n\n362\n00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.820\nBut being able to do just\nthese simple things right,\n\n363\n00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.560\nwill allow you now to take numbers and\nthen when somebody asks you,\n\n364\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.270\ncan you show me just like what Dr Tony\njust did on the fly right here.\n\n365\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.990\nHe said, I wanna see what the ratio is\nfrom what we're owed this year versus\n\n366\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.500\nthe previous year.\n\n367\n00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.435\nHe didn't have to go and\nfind a particular function to do so,\n\n368\n00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:14.373\nhe simply did that intuitively on the fly\nbecause he knew the basics of what we\n\n369\n00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:17.017\nwere talking about here and how do that.\n\n370\n00:21:17.017 --> 00:21:21.542\nAnd you to, if you'll at least learn some\nof the basics here that he's showing you,\n\n371\n00:21:21.542 --> 00:21:25.428\nit will help you to begin to be a little\nmore intuitive about how to work and\n\n372\n00:21:25.428 --> 00:21:26.854\nnot be so afraid of Excel.\n\n373\n00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:30.775\nCuz Excel can really help you when you're\ndealing with a tremendous mount of\n\n374\n00:21:30.775 --> 00:21:34.880\nexisting data and you now need values out\nof that data, and you can actually take\n\n375\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.923\nall that information and create whatever\nvalues that you need to by using these\n\n376\n00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:42.500\nbuilt in functions and formulas and\nunderstanding the basics here.\n\n377\n00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:48.393\n>> So now, the possibilities are endless.\n\n378\n00:21:48.393 --> 00:21:51.657\nThink about the kind of formulas\nyou can create, they're enormous,\n\n379\n00:21:51.657 --> 00:21:54.441\nthere's some functions that\nalready exist on the system.\n\n380\n00:21:54.441 --> 00:21:56.760\nThere are others you an create for\nyourself.\n\n381\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.010\nNow, we're gonna move to another\nsection which is about charts.\n\n382\n00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.608\nBut before we go there, I've just\nremembered that there's a very important\n\n383\n00:22:04.608 --> 00:22:08.938\nquestion that I must give, and\na very important lesson that we must get.\n\n384\n00:22:08.938 --> 00:22:12.727\nWhen we were in school, and\nI was learning basic mathematics,\n\n385\n00:22:12.727 --> 00:22:15.312\nI was taught something called board mass.\n\n386\n00:22:15.312 --> 00:22:20.099\nAnd board mass was to help me understand\nthat depending on how you put the numbers\n\n387\n00:22:20.099 --> 00:22:23.906\nwhen you're writing a formula,\nthe result can be different.\n\n388\n00:22:23.906 --> 00:22:28.560\nAnd also, board mass because you\ngotta start with brackets and\n\n389\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.110\nthen you have multiplication and\nthen division, stuff like that.\n\n390\n00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.800\nAnd we're going to just look\nat this simple example here,\n\n391\n00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.895\nshow you how that's important.\n\n392\n00:22:38.895 --> 00:22:42.498\nWhen you set that function\nto compute something,\n\n393\n00:22:42.498 --> 00:22:45.257\nbe very careful that you got it right.\n\n394\n00:22:45.257 --> 00:22:46.499\nSo let's see.\n\n395\n00:22:46.499 --> 00:22:48.728\nHere is a simple rule.\n\n396\n00:22:48.728 --> 00:22:53.636\nI want to do,\nassuming I put an equal sign and\n\n397\n00:22:53.636 --> 00:22:58.690\nthen I want to do 4 times\n2 to the power of 3.\n\n398\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.280\nHow would I do that?\n\n399\n00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.935\nHow would I present that formula because\nthere's no power passes within the excel.\n\n400\n00:23:04.935 --> 00:23:07.010\nSo, here's an example.\n\n401\n00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.935\nSo, there's is a step, say, okay fine.\n\n402\n00:23:09.935 --> 00:23:13.010\nLet's do 2 to power 3 equals to 8.\n\n403\n00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:17.610\nAnd when we've got that 8,\nthen multiply 8 by the 4, we get 32.\n\n404\n00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.012\nOkay, that's fine.\n\n405\n00:23:20.012 --> 00:23:22.764\nLet's look at another number,\nan example down here.\n\n406\n00:23:22.764 --> 00:23:27.975\nSo, if I have 4 times\n2 plus 3 divided by 3,\n\n407\n00:23:27.975 --> 00:23:35.110\ndepending on the sequence,\nthe result can be different.\n\n408\n00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.060\nIf you multiply 4 by 2 and you get 8.\n\n409\n00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.869\nAnd then you do 3 divided by 3, you get 1.\n\n410\n00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:46.430\nAnd then multiply that 8 plus, I mean add\n8 to 1, then you get a 9, that’s okay.\n\n411\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.834\nBut, depending on where\nyou put the bracket,\n\n412\n00:23:48.834 --> 00:23:51.370\nthe equation can be very different.\n\n413\n00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.130\nSo we have an example\nhere that has a bracket.\n\n414\n00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.003\nSo you have a 3 and a 1.\n\n415\n00:23:57.003 --> 00:24:01.484\nThat there is an addition so basically\nthe sequence will be that the 3 and\n\n416\n00:24:01.484 --> 00:24:05.082\nthe 1 will be handled first\nBecause if he did one in there,\n\n417\n00:24:05.082 --> 00:24:10.650\nthen it means that 1 and the 2 will be\nhandled differently from the 2 and the 3.\n\n418\n00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.990\nSo, the sequence will be that the 3 and\nthe 1 will be handled first.\n\n419\n00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:19.310\nNow you have 3, and then [INAUDIBLE]\nin the bracket you have the 4 and\n\n420\n00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:25.100\nthere’s an opportunity now to do 2 and\nthe 4, and then divide by 2.\n\n421\n00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.199\nSo you have 2 and 4 which gives you 8,\nand then divide that by 2,\n\n422\n00:24:29.199 --> 00:24:34.176\nwhich gives you 4, and then you finally\nhave an opportunity to do 2 to power 4,\n\n423\n00:24:34.176 --> 00:24:38.668\nso power 4 is the outcome of the entire\nbracket, and then you get a 16.\n\n424\n00:24:38.668 --> 00:24:43.024\nNow this is just a simple example because\nwe don't have a lot of time to try and\n\n425\n00:24:43.024 --> 00:24:48.220\ncreate it in different ways so you see the\nimpact of changing where the bracket is.\n\n426\n00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.280\nThe power of the brackets help\nyou to put some numbers together,\n\n427\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.520\nand some figures together, so\nyou can handle them as a block, and\n\n428\n00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.090\nget the outcome that you want out of them,\nor the output for that matter, and\n\n429\n00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.550\nthen use it in the rest of the function.\n\n430\n00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:07.303\nSo, before you release, before you\nconclude, that that is a right result you\n\n431\n00:25:07.303 --> 00:25:11.205\nwanted from an equation remember\nthe numbers are gonna change.\n\n432\n00:25:11.205 --> 00:25:13.718\nIf you're creating a formula,\nyou're selecting cells,\n\n433\n00:25:13.718 --> 00:25:16.446\nyou're not selecting the numbers,\nyou're selecting cells.\n\n434\n00:25:16.446 --> 00:25:20.851\nSo if the content of the cell changes,\nthe result is gonna change, and\n\n435\n00:25:20.851 --> 00:25:25.781\nif you have a very complex formula and\nyou're handling lots and lots of data and\n\n436\n00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:30.439\nyou don't get the brackets right,\nyou can get a very misleading output.\n\n437\n00:25:30.439 --> 00:25:32.460\nIsn't that true?\n\n438\n00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.100\n>> There's no doubt that this is one\nof the key elements in learning about\n\n439\n00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.332\nfunctions here.\n\n440\n00:25:37.332 --> 00:25:40.650\nThat the very first thing that I normally\nlearned when I first started Excel\n\n441\n00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.090\nis that every formula\nbegins with an equal sign.\n\n442\n00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:47.556\nAnd then I have to understand that\norder of operations, which is what Dr.\n\n443\n00:25:47.556 --> 00:25:49.332\nTonny is explaining to us.\n\n444\n00:25:49.332 --> 00:25:51.190\nWe do mathematics the same way so\n\n445\n00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.370\nthat we get the same results\nusing the same numbers.\n\n446\n00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.998\nBut if we were to take that example\nthat Dr. Tonny showed us, and instead,\n\n447\n00:25:58.998 --> 00:26:03.994\nin our mind as we build formulas inside of\nExcel, we started thinking just left to\n\n448\n00:26:03.994 --> 00:26:08.633\nright instead of the order of operations,\nwe will have the wrong results.\n\n449\n00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:12.050\nAnd you might say, well,\nwhy is it the wrong results?\n\n450\n00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:16.330\nIt is because the way that Excel\nwas programmed and designed,\n\n451\n00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:21.240\nit only knows how to do math according\nto those order of operations.\n\n452\n00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.750\nNow you and\nI may choose to do it differently.\n\n453\n00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:28.210\nAnd if we do this perfectly fine, it means\nwe have to know where to put the brackets\n\n454\n00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.800\nto give us the results\nthat we are talking about.\n\n455\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.343\nSo in that first example, where Dr.\nTonny showed us that 4 times 2 to\n\n456\n00:26:35.343 --> 00:26:39.579\nthe third power, well if I do it\ndifferently in this way, right,\n\n457\n00:26:39.579 --> 00:26:43.449\nthe result that Dr.\nTonny gave us was that result was 32.\n\n458\n00:26:43.449 --> 00:26:49.840\nBut if I just work from left to right,\nI do 4 times 2, well, that gives me 8.\n\n459\n00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.070\nAnd then I raise it to the third power,\nwell that's 8 to the third power.\n\n460\n00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.555\nAnd I'm gonna mess that up, and that's\ngonna be 512 if I remember correctly,\n\n461\n00:26:57.555 --> 00:26:58.574\nit's gonna be 512.\n\n462\n00:26:58.574 --> 00:27:02.527\nWell, that is a significant\ndifference from the 32 that Dr.\n\n463\n00:27:02.527 --> 00:27:07.530\nTonny came up with, and the 32 that\nnormally Excel will come up with.\n\n464\n00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.680\nIf I'm expecting 512 and I see a 32,\n\n465\n00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.550\nnormally, I am not gonna\nassume that I am incorrect.\n\n466\n00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:19.092\nI'm gonna assume that Excel is incorrect,\nand in that position I would be wrong.\n\n467\n00:27:19.092 --> 00:27:23.963\nI would be absolutely wrong because\nExcel is doing the math according to\n\n468\n00:27:23.963 --> 00:27:27.640\nthe way that we were taught,\nand then I am not.\n\n469\n00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.559\nSo you do want to be careful with that the\norder of operations because very easy to\n\n470\n00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:35.184\nthink logically just left to right as\nyou see it in that formula bar when you\n\n471\n00:27:35.184 --> 00:27:35.784\ncreate it.\n\n472\n00:27:35.784 --> 00:27:37.962\nBut you always have to think about this,\nor\n\n473\n00:27:37.962 --> 00:27:40.815\nyou will get results that you\nwere not expecting to see.\n\n474\n00:27:40.815 --> 00:27:44.644\nAnd that can lead to very\nbad mathematics for you and\n\n475\n00:27:44.644 --> 00:27:49.880\nactually a lot of frustration as\nyou continue to build formulas.\n\n476\n00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.213\nSo always pay attention and be careful\nhere as we take a look at formulas.\n\n477\n00:27:54.802 --> 00:27:59.534\n>> Awesome, now we're gonna\nstart wrapping up this section,\n\n478\n00:27:59.534 --> 00:28:04.590\nand the best way to wrap it\nup is thinking about charts.\n\n479\n00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:08.560\nThinking about different ways\nof presenting the same data that\n\n480\n00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.900\nwe already have.\n\n481\n00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.610\nSo we're gonna spend a few\nmoments just to try and\n\n482\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.630\nunderstand how do we create charts and\nhow do we manipulate these charts.\n\n483\n00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.820\nAnd what kind of output can\nwe possibly get, all right?\n\n484\n00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.350\nSo I'm going to illustrate\nwith a very simple table.\n\n485\n00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.712\nSo what I've done is\nI've created a new table\n\n486\n00:28:28.712 --> 00:28:33.700\nunder my new worksheet,\nwhich I call Sales.\n\n487\n00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:39.300\nAnd I said, well, let's just simplify\nit and we have the same names there.\n\n488\n00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:45.130\nAnd then we have, Tony was able to sell\n\n489\n00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:51.170\nmerchandise worth 100 King's shillings,\nhypothetical.\n\n490\n00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:55.850\nAnd then Jim's was able to sell\nworth 18 shillings, John 40, on and\n\n491\n00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.220\non and on, all right?\n\n492\n00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:58.950\nSo I'm going to try and\n\n493\n00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.188\nincrease the font so that maybe it's\na little more visible, there we go.\n\n494\n00:29:03.188 --> 00:29:07.830\nSo I have a total of an amount, and\n\n495\n00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.480\nwhat happened is that people were\nselling in different months.\n\n496\n00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.290\nSo the months should be any\nmonth between January and\n\n497\n00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:21.300\nDecember and simple.\n\n498\n00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:28.580\nSomebody came and reported that Tony\nsold 100 worth in the month of December.\n\n499\n00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.782\nAnd James sold 18 in the month of\nFebruary, something along those lines.\n\n500\n00:29:32.782 --> 00:29:34.590\nOf course,\nthis doesn't make a lot of sense yet,\n\n501\n00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:38.630\nbut just to demonstrate we need\nto create some simple chart.\n\n502\n00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:44.341\nSo if I come here and select the entire\ntext like we said, and then I go Insert.\n\n503\n00:29:44.341 --> 00:29:48.750\nAnd then I select, let's say we\nwant to create some bar charts.\n\n504\n00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:56.510\nAnd it's in column version,\ncuz you can also do it in horizontal form.\n\n505\n00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:01.122\nSo let's pick one and\nI want to do a two dimensional chart,\n\n506\n00:30:01.122 --> 00:30:04.680\nbar chart for that matter.\n\n507\n00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.250\nAnd here we come.\n\n508\n00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.800\nSo it's created for me some simple chart.\n\n509\n00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.810\nAnd I want to resize it, so\n\n510\n00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:16.780\nthat we see what is the connection\nbetween the chart itself and the data.\n\n511\n00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.200\nSo what Excel has done, is it has\ncreated for me an x axis and a y axis.\n\n512\n00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.130\nSo x axis gives me the names\nof the people, and\n\n513\n00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:29.450\non the y axis, it's given me that amount.\n\n514\n00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.282\nIt's just created a scale from 0 to 250.\n\n515\n00:30:32.282 --> 00:30:36.387\nNow, you will note that it has\ncreated very reasonable intervals.\n\n516\n00:30:36.387 --> 00:30:40.462\nI didn't create them, but it has\nthe intelligence to figure out, well,\n\n517\n00:30:40.462 --> 00:30:43.435\nthe largest amount that\nyou had was actually 200.\n\n518\n00:30:43.435 --> 00:30:48.725\nSo I'll give it up to 250 and then I'll\nlist all the individuals on the right.\n\n519\n00:30:48.725 --> 00:30:50.635\nNow there are two columns.\n\n520\n00:30:50.635 --> 00:30:54.427\nSo what it's basically done, for\nTonny O, it's actually said,\n\n521\n00:30:54.427 --> 00:30:57.895\nyou can see the amount of 100\nis actually reflected here.\n\n522\n00:30:57.895 --> 00:31:00.684\nAnd if you point right there,\nyou'll see the value is 100.\n\n523\n00:31:00.684 --> 00:31:07.180\nAnd then it has also put the second\ncolumn, for Tonny again, of 12.\n\n524\n00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:12.890\nSo using the same scale, that's why this\none is appearing to be smaller, all right?\n\n525\n00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.400\nSo this way I am now represented and\nautomatically it created for\n\n526\n00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.040\nme some kind of index,\n\n527\n00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:23.672\nsome kind of way of describing what\nexactly are the two colors for, all right.\n\n528\n00:31:23.672 --> 00:31:30.590\nSo color legend or whatever it may be\ncalled in your own representation.\n\n529\n00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.550\nSo there we go.\n\n530\n00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:34.850\nWe can have a title if we want it,\nbut at least it gives you a sense.\n\n531\n00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.490\nNow lets try to change a value and\nsee what happens to the chart.\n\n532\n00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.965\nSo I'm gonna change this to 8.\n\n533\n00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.040\nSee what happens,\nautomatically it increases.\n\n534\n00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.646\nSo let's look at this,\nthe long one of 200.\n\n535\n00:31:48.646 --> 00:31:52.060\nSo assuming it's a mistake,\nit should have been 100.\n\n536\n00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.709\nSo I delete this and put 100.\n\n537\n00:31:53.709 --> 00:31:58.509\nYep, then it's adjusted.\n\n538\n00:31:58.509 --> 00:32:03.079\nAnd basically what happens, it adjust the\nEntire sheet, so that it's proportionate.\n\n539\n00:32:03.079 --> 00:32:09.870\nIf for example, this was 400 because\nthe scale right now is up to 150,\n\n540\n00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:15.290\nso let's change that to 400 and\nsee what will happen.\n\n541\n00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.664\nSo I delete and say 400.\n\n542\n00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.700\nSo what it's basically done,\nit's changed the scale.\n\n543\n00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.710\nRecomputes, figures out what would\nbe the possibly largest number.\n\n544\n00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:25.390\nYeah, 400.\n\n545\n00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.370\nNow, I'm trying to add that by 100.\n\n546\n00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:31.953\nIt's created maximum 500, and then,\n\n547\n00:32:31.953 --> 00:32:36.150\nit redistributes the entire\nset of numbers over there.\n\n548\n00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.830\nAnd you can see 400 is the largest.\n\n549\n00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:43.460\nIt's just a simple way\nof creating a chart.\n\n550\n00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.570\nJust a simple chart.\n\n551\n00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.360\nThere are many other kinds of\ncharts as you can see up here.\n\n552\n00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.812\nThere are bar charts, there are areas,\nthere are scatters, there are pie charts,\n\n553\n00:32:53.812 --> 00:32:55.750\nthere are line graphs, all that.\n\n554\n00:32:55.750 --> 00:33:00.610\nAnd it's possible to move between these\nkind of charts, different kinds of charts.\n\n555\n00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:06.030\nSo for example, I could say let me try,\nI pick name and\n\n556\n00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:10.770\nthe amount and\nthen I say I wanna do a pie chart.\n\n557\n00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.790\nAnd I just click a pie chart.\n\n558\n00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:13.770\nI've got a pie chart here.\n\n559\n00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:19.270\nOf course I can do the necessary edits\nthat I want, and then there is a chart.\n\n560\n00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:24.190\nThis is the largest area and I can go to\nthe data and see what exactly was that.\n\n561\n00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.290\nI can change one chart to another.\n\n562\n00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.400\nI can very,\n\n563\n00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.220\nvery easily, if I right-click that chart,\nI can simply change that chart type.\n\n564\n00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.740\nIf I click that and then I go, okay,\n\n565\n00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.350\nI want to see what other\nchart could it possibly be.\n\n566\n00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.000\nLet me select this one and\nsee what happens.\n\n567\n00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.630\nWhoa, it creates a different\nkind of chart, same data,\n\n568\n00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.440\nbut different representation.\n\n569\n00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.900\nSo why do you possibly need\ndifferent representation?\n\n570\n00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.820\nIt depends on the kind of\ncommunication you wanna give.\n\n571\n00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.300\nWhat kind of information\ndo you wanna pass around?\n\n572\n00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.310\nBecause some charts are better at\nrepresenting certain kind of data.\n\n573\n00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:00.930\nYou don't want hundreds of bars.\n\n574\n00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.990\nOr it you have some very simple data\nthat is showing three elements,\n\n575\n00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.420\nyou're probably wanting\nto show how do these\n\n576\n00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.020\nthree elements relate to\nthe larger scheme of things.\n\n577\n00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.900\nSo out of 100 where do they fit?\n\n578\n00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.100\nWhat is the ratio here?\n\n579\n00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.160\nSo you could do a bar chart.\n\n580\n00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.020\nSo this is not for\n\n581\n00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:23.380\npurposes of trying to explain what\nis a chart and what kind of chart.\n\n582\n00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.110\nWe're not in a statistics class now, we're\nbasically trying to say that you have\n\n583\n00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:32.740\nan opportunity for creating different kind\nof charts, moving around between charts.\n\n584\n00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:36.017\nAnd then after which you can manipulate\nthis chart, create the titles,\n\n585\n00:34:36.017 --> 00:34:40.110\nthe themes, you can change the colors\nhere and there and re-present these and\n\n586\n00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.180\nyou can export these.\n\n587\n00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.200\nThat means we can extract it and\nput it in a different document.\n\n588\n00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.210\nSo you're working on a Word document,\nand you're writing a report.\n\n589\n00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.880\nYou can manipulate this data,\ngenerate the chart, and\n\n590\n00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.480\nthen migrate that chart and\nput it in a Word document.\n\n591\n00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.560\nAnd then print something really,\n\n592\n00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.030\nreally beautiful which contains\na lot of information all together.\n\n593\n00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.140\nI want to believe that charts is one\nof the very important tools that\n\n594\n00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.530\npeople must learn when\nthey're using Excel.\n\n595\n00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:07.410\n>> There is no doubt that charts really\nmake the impact that we need to and\n\n596\n00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:11.160\nit really helps to give\nus a graphical summary\n\n597\n00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.620\nof a bunch of the data that we're seeing.\n\n598\n00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.640\nNow the key here to understanding\nwhat charts to pick is\n\n599\n00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.830\nyou being familiar with\nthe data that you're using.\n\n600\n00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.220\nIt doesn't tend to make sense if you're\nnot familiar with the data that you're\n\n601\n00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.040\nusing to try and make a chart at all.\n\n602\n00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.290\nBut once you start seeing the actual data,\nit may be where somebody says you need to\n\n603\n00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:38.390\ncreate a chart in which you're comparing\nthe sales user for the month of January.\n\n604\n00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.020\nWell, if you have a single series chart,\n\n605\n00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.885\nyou may go,\nwell that's actually a piece of the pie.\n\n606\n00:35:42.885 --> 00:35:47.180\nWell how much does each particular\nsalesperson make of that piece of the pie?\n\n607\n00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:52.020\nOr you may be comparing each salesperson\nwith the multiple months, so\n\n608\n00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.820\nit might be where you actually say, I\nwant to see all of the actual sales data,\n\n609\n00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.770\nby salesperson and\nthe first quarter of the year.\n\n610\n00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.590\nWell, you're actually taking\na look at the same data, but\n\n611\n00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.060\nfor each month in the first year.\n\n612\n00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.790\nWell, then you might create a bar\nchart that actually shows multiple\n\n613\n00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:11.170\nseries of data that's the same\ntype of data, but over time.\n\n614\n00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:14.420\nAnd you might find yourself actually\nusing some of the other ones.\n\n615\n00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:18.950\nBut at the very beginning, at least\nunderstanding the basics of a pie and\n\n616\n00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.610\nbar chart is where we want to begin.\n\n617\n00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:25.470\nAnd this is all so that we don't\ntend to hand over a spreadsheet\n\n618\n00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:29.710\nthat just has let's say 60 rows in it and\n\n619\n00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:34.790\nthen of course that means there's actually\nthree or four or maybe ten columns.\n\n620\n00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:38.770\nWhat we might be able to do instead is\nactually be able to summarize that data,\n\n621\n00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.080\npresent it in a graphical way.\n\n622\n00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.880\nAnd now which people can\ntake a look at that and\n\n623\n00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.756\nbegin to actually say, all right, so\ncomparatively by using the chart,\n\n624\n00:36:48.756 --> 00:36:53.560\nDid Tonny actually win in the first\nquarter as far as number of sales?\n\n625\n00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.988\nWell, we don’t have to look\nat the individual numbers.\n\n626\n00:36:55.988 --> 00:36:59.450\nIf Dr Tonny's bar is higher than\neverybody else's, then we know,\n\n627\n00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.560\nyes, he actually did\ntake a lead in that one.\n\n628\n00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.690\nAnd that's why charts are very important.\n\n629\n00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:09.860\nIt doesn't actually give us really, as far\nas a lot of technical details behind it.\n\n630\n00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.650\nBut presenting that summary information\nallows us to then be able to interpret\n\n631\n00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:19.370\nthat data and make good decision based\noff of the details of the data, without\n\n632\n00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:23.710\nhaving to overwhelm whoever the audience\nis with the details of that data as well.\n\n633\n00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.450\nSo very much an important element,\n\n634\n00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:30.300\nin terms of you learning how to use Excel,\nis learning how to create these charts.\n\n635\n00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.320\n>> Right.\nWe've been here on it for a while and\n\n636\n00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.330\nI think it's about time that\nwe come to close this session.\n\n637\n00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.180\nBut this is one thing\nI want us to go with.\n\n638\n00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:40.970\nSorting data.\n\n639\n00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:47.050\nIf you've created columns and rows, and\nwe've got numbers in there, sometimes you\n\n640\n00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:52.770\nwant to have a sense, roughly, what is the\nsequence, what is the pattern, all right.\n\n641\n00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.085\nSo what I've done on my computer right\nnow is that I've actually selected\n\n642\n00:37:56.085 --> 00:37:58.331\nthe text that we've been\nactually working with,\n\n643\n00:37:58.331 --> 00:38:01.740\nthe names there, there's Kenyan\nshillings and there's month.\n\n644\n00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.120\nSo let us try to say,\nI want to get a sense of\n\n645\n00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.150\nthe order as to who are the people\nwho owes the largest amount.\n\n646\n00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:14.640\nYou know, so I start with the largest and\ngo all the way to the lowest.\n\n647\n00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.910\nSo we can organize this in many,\nmany ways but\n\n648\n00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:21.120\nI just want to simply\nillustrate a simple example.\n\n649\n00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.110\nSo I can select this whole text and\n\n650\n00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:29.180\nthen I can go sort and\nfilter and I do a custom sort.\n\n651\n00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.448\nThe reason I'm going with the custom sort\nis that there are generic ways of course\n\n652\n00:38:32.448 --> 00:38:35.000\nof doing all of this that have\nbeen already pre designed.\n\n653\n00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.740\nBut I think a custom sort is\ngoing to help us create our own\n\n654\n00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.380\nrules of how we want to sort it.\n\n655\n00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.450\nSo I'm going to click Custom Sort.\n\n656\n00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.650\nAnd then it gives me\nan opportunity to decide by what\n\n657\n00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.520\ndo I want to sort that text.\n\n658\n00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.720\nSo I'll say I want to sort it\nby the Kenyan shillings column,\n\n659\n00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.930\nwhich tells me that fine,\neverything else will remain the same.\n\n660\n00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.250\nSo it'll be moved, but\n\n661\n00:38:55.250 --> 00:39:00.870\nthe sorting will happen on the basis\nof the amount that is owed to us.\n\n662\n00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:03.010\nAnd then I pick the values.\n\n663\n00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.240\nAnd then I say I want to sort\nfrom the largest to the smallest.\n\n664\n00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.130\nAnd then I say OK.\n\n665\n00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:14.010\nNow what happens over here is\nthat it moves the rows up and\n\n666\n00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:19.300\ndown and arranges based on\nthe certain sort of the amount owed.\n\n667\n00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:26.320\nSo Tonny is the one who owes us 200 Kenyan\nshillings, and that's for the month.\n\n668\n00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.558\nForget about the month for now.\n\n669\n00:39:27.558 --> 00:39:34.051\nA different Tonny maybe, owes us 100,\nTonny owes us this much.\n\n670\n00:39:34.051 --> 00:39:38.870\nSo right now they owe that\nin decrementing order.\n\n671\n00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:42.870\nI could have done in incrementing order,\nI could've done in whatever.\n\n672\n00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.370\nI could've ordered this on month.\n\n673\n00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:49.710\nAnd then the good thing about this\nis that when you now begin to create\n\n674\n00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:53.345\nyour tables or your graph for that matter.\n\n675\n00:39:53.345 --> 00:39:56.690\nGraphs starts making a little more\nsense when you start seeing patterns,\n\n676\n00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:57.800\nwhen it's visual.\n\n677\n00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:04.290\nSo if right now the plan is to create\nsome simple chart, there I go.\n\n678\n00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.700\nIt actually shows me in decreasing order.\n\n679\n00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:13.790\nSo if I went here and changed this into\nincreasing order and I did my custom and\n\n680\n00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:18.900\nI just did smallest to largest and\nI say OK, everything changes.\n\n681\n00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:23.480\nSo now this is interesting,\nit shows me that there's a trend.\n\n682\n00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:28.070\nIt also shows me quickly who owes\nthe largest and who owes the smallest, and\n\n683\n00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:29.660\nI can easily make decisions.\n\n684\n00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.240\nSo there are mechanisms for sorting data.\n\n685\n00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.650\nAnd that data that is sorted can be\nreflected in the way we organize our\n\n686\n00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.000\ncharts and bars and whatnot.\n\n687\n00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.970\nSo I hope that that's\na great way to conclude,\n\n688\n00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:47.370\nas we've covered a lot of ground in Excel\ndocument, and I hope that this was useful.\n\n689\n00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:49.310\n>> It definitely is, yeah.\n\n690\n00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:53.030\nSorting data is one of the most useful\ntools that we can use to help us to see\n\n691\n00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.720\nthe way that Dr. Tonny showed us.\n\n692\n00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:59.090\nA lot of times just bringing it to the top\nor to the bottom, that way we can make\n\n693\n00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:02.690\ndecisions very quickly on just some\ninformation that we need to see,\n\n694\n00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.380\nwhether it's based on largest or\nsmallest numbers.\n\n695\n00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.520\nWell that's great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n696\n00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.150\nSigning off for ITPro.TV.\n\n697\n00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.990\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n698\n00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.810\n>> And my name is Dr. Tonny Omwansa,\nit's been great learning together,\n\n699\n00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:18.380\nI'm really looking forward\nto another session.\n\n700\n00:41:18.380 -->

00:00:19.795\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and you're\nwatching the computing fundamentals IC3\n\n4\n00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:24.811\nshow, where we are continuing on in a part\ntwo inside of Microsoft

at, but\n\n7\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.090\nwe need to continue on so that we\nactually have a better understanding.\n\n8\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.981\nAnd who better to help us than Dr.\nTonny Omwansa.\n\n9\n00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.870\nDr. Omwansa, welcome back to our studio.\n\n10\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.870\n>> Thank you very much,\nthanks for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.120\nIt's always fun learning together, and\nwe look forward to another session.\n\n12\n00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.860\n>> All right, so\n\n13\n00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.860\nwhen we started yesterday or when we\nstarted in that previous episode, right.\n\n14\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.890\nWe were taking a look and talking about\njust the fundamental reasons why we need\n\n15\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.020\nto understand the idea here of\nusing access as a database.\n\n16\n00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.140\nAnd we talked about the comparison between\na spreadsheet versus a database and\n\n17\n00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.410\nthen, we also talked about relationships\nand the idea of entities and\n\n18\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.480\nof course fields and records as well.\n\n19\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.900\nThose are kind of the core and\nfoundational terms and\n\n20\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.990\nof course concepts that\nwe need to understand.\n\n21\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.810\nSo what else do we need\nto begin with here, sir?\n\n22\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.180\n>> All right,\nwe'll pick up exactly where we stopped and\n\n23\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.080\nwe're just gonna talk about\nsome new additional things and\n\n24\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.960\nI think two things that we're now\ngonna pick on is queries and forms.\n\n25\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.290\nYou see, the table that we spoke\nabout organizing columns and\n\n26\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.010\nrows, we can visualize that.\n\n27\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.520\nBut think about it, if you have several\nfields that describe a particular entity,\n\n28\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.410\nthey can be as many as 100.\n\n29\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.200\nIf you start scrolling across\ntrying to make entries or\n\n30\n00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.160\nchanges, it can be a little overwhelming.\n\n31\n00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.360\nAfter all, you have lots and\nlots of records as well in many cases.\n\n32\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.240\nSo we use forms to help us\nfocus on one particular record.\n\n33\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.900\nAnd it's organized in a manner\nthat we can relate with.\n\n34\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.920\nYou can have a description of a field and\n\n35\n00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.530\na box where you can type in,\na check box if you want to select things,\n\n36\n00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.480\nradio buttons where you can make\nselections and things like that.\n\n37\n00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.965\nSo the forms are very good for\nmaking entries of records into the tables.\n\n38\n00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.840\nAnd the good thing about forms is\nit can actually enable you to do\n\n39\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.320\nentries into more than one table.\n\n40\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.064\nAnd then not only can you make entries,\nyou can also pull data from the table and\n\n41\n00:02:36.064 --> 00:02:42.530\ndisplay it and read, make changes,\nupdate and then send back to the database.\n\n42\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.920\nSo it's a tool that enables\nyou to make entries and\n\n43\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.290\nmanipulate one record at a time.\n\n44\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.340\nYou can actually scroll and get to see\ndifferent records at different times so\n\n45\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.320\nit makes it much easier\nto visualize one record.\n\n46\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.210\nI want to believe that\nthat's a useful tool.\n\n47\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.260\nIsn't it, Ronald?\n\n48\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.960\n>> It definitely is, because exactly of\nwhat Dr. Omwaza was talking about here.\n\n49\n00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.400\nThe very fact that if we were to\ntake a regular spreadsheet and\n\n50\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.580\nwe were to have 100 different columns,\n\n51\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.810\nit becomes a little bit harder in terms\nof data entry even for one record.\n\n52\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.760\nWhen you do have to scroll off the screen\nand you're still doing data entry and\n\n53\n00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.000\nwhat if you believe you've\nmade a mistake somewhere.\n\n54\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.460\nWell now you have to scroll\nall the way back and\n\n55\n00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.190\nsee are you actually still working on\nthe same record that you thought you were.\n\n56\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.420\nThe other advantage of forms\nright here was also mentioned,\n\n57\n00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.180\nright, is the ability to be able to\ndo data entry in multiple tables.\n\n58\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.750\nIn the example that we just\ngave with a single spreadsheet,\n\n59\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.170\nwell that's only one spreadsheet.\n\n60\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.260\nBut what if I have information stored\nacross multiple spreadsheets instead?\n\n61\n00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.541\nI now have to close out of one, or\nmove one down or restore one down and\n\n62\n00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:45.823\nthen move another one up, and\nactually do the data entry there, and\n\n63\n00:03:45.823 --> 00:03:50.060\nverify that they're actually all\nconnected together the way that we need.\n\n64\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.590\nBy using a form, which is something\nwe can use access to help us create,\n\n65\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.220\nit allowed us to take that entire record,\nand even if all those fields are actually\n\n66\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.530\nstored on different tables\ninside of the access database.\n\n67\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.710\nWell we can actually\nenter in that record and\n\n68\n00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.490\nactually have it update all\nthose tables at the same time.\n\n69\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.330\nIf we find out we made a mistake on\na single record, we can either advance or\n\n70\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.230\nwe can actually reverse our ways through\nthat and update those fields that we need\n\n71\n00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.420\nto or correct errors that we need to,\nif we're given the permission to do so.\n\n72\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.950\nSo the idea of actually doing data\nentry in a very logical and easy manner\n\n73\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.818\nis always gonna be tied to some nature\nof a form inside of Microsoft Access.\n\n74\n00:04:27.818 --> 00:04:31.320\nSo Dr.\nOmwanza this is not the only aspect of\n\n75\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.110\nusing a database which of\ncourse is to do data entry.\n\n76\n00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.230\nBut we also need to be able\nto get data out of it.\n\n77\n00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.210\nSo what do we need to use here?\n\n78\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.530\n>> All right now if you want to get data\nout of a database of course the form is\n\n79\n00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.220\njust one basic way of getting\ndata out of the database.\n\n80\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.940\nThe form typically gets\nconnected to a table and\n\n81\n00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.420\nyou can use that to pull data,\nview and post.\n\n82\n00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.650\nAnd right on my desk,\n\n83\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.560\nmy screen I have a simple form but\nit's just been designed so well.\n\n84\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.300\nAssuming there was a table called product,\nI can see Product ID, Name, etc, etc.\n\n85\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.290\nAnd using those fields I can make entries\ninto the database and pull them up.\n\n86\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.370\nBut sometimes you don't wanna see\neverything about a particular table.\n\n87\n00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.572\nProbably you're not\ninterested in all the fields.\n\n88\n00:05:18.572 --> 00:05:20.825\nYou just probably want\nto see a few fields.\n\n89\n00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:26.591\nOr you want to see some fields from more\nthan one table in some structured way,\n\n90\n00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:27.930\nsummarized way.\n\n91\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.520\nAnd therefore you need something\nthat enables you to extract\n\n92\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.910\nvery specific bits and pieces of data and\nthere comes the query.\n\n93\n00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.520\nSo we can create a query just\nlike the name suggests you're\n\n94\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.800\nquerying something right?\n\n95\n00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.900\nSo you can actually write\nan instruction using very simple,\n\n96\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.390\nyou know conflagration, call it language,\na programming language that is called SQL.\n\n97\n00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.730\nAnd you can send an instruction\nto the database and ask for\n\n98\n00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.920\nvery specific pieces of information.\n\n99\n00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.000\nNow you can store that query so\n\n100\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.860\nthat you can reuse it every\nother time you need to use it.\n\n101\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.610\nSo I might say I'm creating\na query to give me the student\n\n102\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.990\nfirst name and last name.\n\n103\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.580\nThat's it,\nthat's all I want from the student table.\n\n104\n00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.720\nSo I would say something\nlike select first name and\n\n105\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.900\nlast name from the table called Students,\nand that's it.\n\n106\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.690\nAnd then I run that query and\nthey display for me that particular data.\n\n107\n00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.930\nHave you worked with queries before,\nRonnie?\n\n108\n00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.570\n>> I have actually worked with\na few queries before, and\n\n109\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.570\nlearning the basics of that\nlanguage is really going to be\n\n110\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.980\nessential as you start working more and\nmore with different data bases.\n\n111\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.460\nIt's not necessarily that you have to\nmaster it because of the way that Access\n\n112\n00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.600\nworks with it, tt really does allow us\nto be able to just point and click.\n\n113\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.816\nAnd we can design a query doing that\ninside of Microsoft Access instead.\n\n114\n00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:51.850\nWhereas what Dr. Omwanza was talking\nabout of being able to write a query,\n\n115\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.030\nyou of course can do the same\nthing inside of Access as well.\n\n116\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.080\nNow that's beyond the scope of what\nwe're normally talking about in\n\n117\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.430\nthis particular level but\n\n118\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.490\nat the same time though, Microsoft Access\ngives you that ability to do so.\n\n119\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.940\nThe ultimate goal of that query is\nnot to just extract the data, but\n\n120\n00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.230\nto extract data and actually place it in\nrelationship to other data that we need\n\n121\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.970\nif we wanna do some type\nof analysis with it.\n\n122\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.690\nSo it might be where you\ninstead choose to not only,\n\n123\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.090\nsay hey,\nhere is the information that I need but\n\n124\n00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.880\nyou also need to be able to present that\ndata to someone else and that is where we\n\n125\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.850\nalso come into the idea of creating\nreports from using the queries.\n\n126\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.310\nSo queries help us to actually\nextract what we need,\n\n127\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.680\nreports make it look in a presentable\nmanner and logical manner so\n\n128\n00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.200\nthat somebody can make a business decision\nbased off of that information as well.\n\n129\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.380\nSo, when we start seeing\nthe overall nature of Access,\n\n130\n00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.320\nright, we know that it stores data.\n\n131\n00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.006\nWe now know that we can query the\ninformation, and we now know that we can,\n\n132\n00:07:50.006 --> 00:07:52.922\nactually, make, well,\nextract information out of it,\n\n133\n00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:56.270\nby using queries to help us to also\nmake reports out of that as well.\n\n134\n00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.579\nSo, Dr. Omwanza,\nwhere do we need to head next?\n\n135\n00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:04.019\n>> The next bit that we gotta know is\nabout reports So you see the form is very\n\n136\n00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:07.867\ngood for entering the data that\nyou want to go into the table and\n\n137\n00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:10.620\nof course you can pull it out.\n\n138\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.710\nAnd then you've got a query that enables\nyou to extract data from the table or\n\n139\n00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.270\ntables.\n\n140\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.660\nAnd now, but to know what the query does\nis the activity generates that data in\n\n141\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.040\nraw form, and then organizes it\nsome kind of temporary table, so\n\n142\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.700\nyou'll actually see the data almost\nappearing like another table.\n\n143\n00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.670\nSo the other thing that you're\ngonna need is a report.\n\n144\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.350\nSo what happens is that access\nhas a mechanism to design\n\n145\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.930\na report just like maybe we'd created\na report in Microsoft Word or Excel for\n\n146\n00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:47.310\nthat matter in a structured way,\nhave columns and some rows.\n\n147\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.220\nAnd then you can have a title, and you can\nhave some borders and things like that.\n\n148\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.910\nSo right on my screen now, it's a snapshot\nof all the things that we've talked about\n\n149\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.450\nbefore we're going into the experience\nof trying to create a simple database,\n\n150\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.400\nwhich I'm sure we want to do it ourselves.\n\n151\n00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.930\nSo I just opened a database that\nwas already in the computer.\n\n152\n00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.710\nAnd I wanna close all these so that you\nsystematically see how we get there.\n\n153\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.830\nThe database is called Student Database.\n\n154\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.750\nIt's just for purposes of illustration.\n\n155\n00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.210\nRight on this left end here\nthere are all the objects that\n\n156\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.390\nhave to do with this particular\ndatabase and I've got a set of tables.\n\n157\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.680\nSo you can see right up here is tables and\nI've got a set of tables out.\n\n158\n00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.800\nA few tiles, guardians,\n\n159\n00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.620\nsettings, student attendance,\nstudents, student and guardians.\n\n160\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.870\nWe're not going to do the details into\nexactly how are they created, but\n\n161\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.060\nat least you can see we\ncan have a set of tables.\n\n162\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.420\nThen we've got a set of queries.\n\n163\n00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.210\nI won't run them, but at least let me just\nopen one simple table about students.\n\n164\n00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.860\nYou can see the students here,\nthe student ID one, Tony on one,\n\n165\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.590\nthere's a Gmail address, etc, etc, etc.\n\n166\n00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.230\nSo there are very many\nfeeds about that student.\n\n167\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.380\nThen there's several other tables as well.\n\n168\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.240\nThen there are queries here,\nso if I had to pick student\n\n169\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.860\nextended, when I clicked it has actually\ndisplayed some data from my table.\n\n170\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.760\nI never made any entry into this query.\n\n171\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.200\nBut I pulled some data out of a table.\n\n172\n00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.100\nThen, there are forms.\n\n173\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.700\nSo let me see.\n\n174\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.290\nThere's something called student details.\n\n175\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:29.660\nIf I want to see about the student,\nI immediately pull the first student here.\n\n176\n00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.120\nAnd I can actually make a change if\nI want it and then I save it and\n\n177\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.700\nit'll go to the table.\n\n178\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.700\nAnd as you can see the form\nis very interesting,\n\n179\n00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.520\nyou can actually see the fields.\n\n180\n00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.910\nIt's very well structured to\nunderstand and easy to follow.\n\n181\n00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.520\nAnd the final thing I have down here,\nour report.\n\n182\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.110\nSo I close this and\nI open a single report about students and\n\n183\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.810\nthere you go, my name is already appearing\nas the only student in that report.\n\n184\n00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.890\nAs you can tell, it has a title,\n\n185\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:01.260\nit has some element of a structure here\nand there are several other reports.\n\n186\n00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.650\nFor now, we're not gonna spend our\ntime on the macros and the modules.\n\n187\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.220\nThat's a parallel label if at all\nwe get the time to go into that.\n\n188\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.320\nSo that gives us a snapshot\nof the overall outlook.\n\n189\n00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.900\nI think that the next thing we're gonna go\ninto is trying to create a simple database\n\n190\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.220\nand appreciate the process of creating it.\n\n191\n00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.600\n>> Sounds like a great idea.\n\n192\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.540\nSo when we start talking about getting\nstarted then, Access is not one of those\n\n193\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.580\nin the Office Suite program which really\nhelps you out in terms of getting started,\n\n194\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.760\nexcept for a couple of different ways.\n\n195\n00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.680\nEverybody always wants to create\na database from scratch but\n\n196\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.480\nAccess also has different\ntemplates that are out there,\n\n197\n00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.270\nthat already have established some\nof the tables that you might need.\n\n198\n00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.750\nAnd then you can modify those as well.\n\n199\n00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.980\nBut Dr. Omwansa, where we gonna start?\n\n200\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.530\n>> Okay.\n\n201\n00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:52.550\nWe're gonna start by simply opening\nAccess, appreciate that environment and\n\n202\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.530\ncreate a simple database.\n\n203\n00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.340\n>> Sounds good.\n>> We need to have an experience.\n\n204\n00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.110\nAll right?\n\n205\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.640\nSo, what I'm gonna do on my computer\nis that I'm going to open access and\n\n206\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.170\nI'm making an assumption and\nyou know how to get there real quick.\n\n207\n00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.410\nMicrosoft Access 2010.\n\n208\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.670\nThere we go.\n\n209\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.935\nNow, as my colleague Ronnie\nmentioned is that you have several\n\n210\n00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:19.890\npre-created databases which are template\nand some of them actually have data.\n\n211\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.830\nAnd so you don't even have\nto create from scratch.\n\n212\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.000\nYou can actually take an existing one,\nmake slight modifications over there,\n\n213\n00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.950\ncustomize it, and\nyou're good to go in a much shorter time.\n\n214\n00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.020\nSo there are examples like address book.\n\n215\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.930\nThere are books here.\n\n216\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.770\nThere's budget, business,\ncalculator, etc, etc.\n\n217\n00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.390\nAnd this are, some of them really, really\nwell thought out and they can function and\n\n218\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.410\nrun a whole organization but let's\njust go ahead and create our own now.\n\n219\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.320\nFor us to create our own,\nwe've got to decide on a few things.\n\n220\n00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.620\nThe first we're gonna decide is\nwhat do we call our data base?\n\n221\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.900\nSo right of the end as you can tell,\nit's a blank data base.\n\n222\n00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.871\nIt's a clean slate,\nthere's nothing in there.\n\n223\n00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:01.620\nRight below there,\nthere's an opportunity to give it a name.\n\n224\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.410\nSo this is the file name.\n\n225\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.020\nPeople have different\nnotations of naming things.\n\n226\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.980\nI have this habit of always starting\nwith a prefix of three characters\n\n227\n00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.510\nthat will always tell me, what was\nthis about even before I get the name.\n\n228\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.430\nSo, I could possibly say DBS.\n\n229\n00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.490\nSo that means,\n\n230\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:28.270\nit reminds me that every time I find that\nfile in a computer, it's a database.\n\n231\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.320\nAnd if I send it to someone,\nI'll say, whenever you see DBS,\n\n232\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.470\nit's always a database.\n\n233\n00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.240\nSo let me call this DBS student.\n\n234\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.100\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.420\nAnd then where exactly am I sending it,\n\n236\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:43.100\nthere is a path This path we spoke\nabout in another session about path.\n\n237\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.820\nHow documents are filed or\nstored in the computer.\n\n238\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.880\nSo there is a path.\n\n239\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.090\nSo every time I want to browse\nthe computer and look for it,\n\n240\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.230\nI will look for\nit at c://users/HPDocuments.\n\n241\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.780\nFor now, I don't wanna change that, I can.\n\n242\n00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.160\nOf course if I wanted I can change it and\nfigure out a different path.\n\n243\n00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.870\nBut for now let's just leave it like that.\n\n244\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.060\nThen I have an opportunity\nto create the database.\n\n245\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.850\nThat's it.\n\n246\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:04.410\nBoom.\n\n247\n00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.620\nI created it.\n\n248\n00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.070\nNow, see,\nright up here is called DBS Students.\n\n249\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.190\nOn the right here is\nan opportunity to create tables.\n\n250\n00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.018\nAs you can see, there's no table yet.\n\n251\n00:14:15.018 --> 00:14:17.930\nAnd while there is Table 1.\n\n252\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.900\nIt's not one I created.\n\n253\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:26.000\nIt's just a simple template,\na starting point for creating a table, so.\n\n254\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.270\nI can choose to adapt it or not.\n\n255\n00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.450\nAnd that table has actually\nbeen open right here.\n\n256\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.770\nSo we've got a table\nthat's a starting point.\n\n257\n00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.630\nWe don't have no query, we don't have no\nform, we don't have any report, nothing.\n\n258\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.520\nSimple possible table, but\nthe table has not been saved so\n\n259\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.810\nit is not my table, yeah?\n\n260\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.510\nSo I can decide to do away with it or\nrename it.\n\n261\n00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.910\nA good place to start is to rename\nit rather than do away with it,\n\n262\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.390\nbecause whatever we start\nwith will look like this.\n\n263\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.240\nSo I could possibly rename it.\n\n264\n00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.590\nNow before I go into renaming it,\nhave a look.\n\n265\n00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:03.690\nThere is an opportunity to\nview it in different ways.\n\n266\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.460\nThere is a Datasheet View,\nwhich is now like a spreadsheet.\n\n267\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.380\nAnd that is a design view.\n\n268\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.330\nThose two are very important.\n\n269\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.710\nNow, I'm going to begin by making\nsome changes on this table so\n\n270\n00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.460\nthat we create a structure for it,\nsave it and then, we can begin to use it.\n\n271\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.200\nSo, that I go, now I am on design view,\n\n272\n00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.200\nit's going to ask me if I\nwant to save the table.\n\n273\n00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.820\nSo, for now, I'll say yes,\nI wanna save the table.\n\n274\n00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.220\nI didn't have to go\nstraight [INAUDIBLE] but\n\n275\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.800\nthat's where you have to save the table,\nand therefore you can make changes on it.\n\n276\n00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.190\nSo what I'm calling it is TBL student.\n\n277\n00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.606\nNow maybe you know why I say TBL,\njust like I said look,\n\n278\n00:15:42.606 --> 00:15:48.030\nI like prefixes because it helps\nme to remember what file was that.\n\n279\n00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:52.610\nWhen I start doing queries and\nI want QRY to see if this is equivalent.\n\n280\n00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:57.560\nIf I'm writing poet, I'll probably put\nRTP to remind me that it's a report.\n\n281\n00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.700\nSo I've got students.\n\n282\n00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.732\nAll right.\nNow, students.\n\n283\n00:16:01.732 --> 00:16:03.686\nI've put it in plural,\nbecause chances are,\n\n284\n00:16:03.686 --> 00:16:05.652\nI'm gonna put several\nstudents in the table.\n\n285\n00:16:05.652 --> 00:16:06.261\nRight?\n\n286\n00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:11.418\nSo there we go, I have TBL students and\nit's right here renamed and\n\n287\n00:16:11.418 --> 00:16:15.360\nnow I'm on the design view of the table.\n\n288\n00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.500\nBut let's change and\ngo to Data Sheet View.\n\n289\n00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.570\nIf I look at Data Sheet View\nit's giving me a spreadsheet,\n\n290\n00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.210\nthe potential of columns will be there and\nthe rows.\n\n291\n00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.090\nAnd then I have Design View,\n\n292\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.510\nwhich gives me now the opportunity\nto design that table.\n\n293\n00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.130\nNow I want just to talk a little\nbit about this design view, so\n\n294\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.729\nthat we understand a few things before\nwe can create our simple table.\n\n295\n00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:45.150\nUnlike Excel, we don't normally worry so\n\n296\n00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.280\nmuch how the characteristics\nof the fields.\n\n297\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.290\nI'm gonna have columns and\nwe name them up there.\n\n298\n00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.000\nWe don't worry normally about\nthe characteristics of the fields.\n\n299\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.710\nWhether it's really going to be a date,\nwhat type of date?\n\n300\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.330\nWe don't spend a lot of time,\ncuz I know we are loading in data,\n\n301\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.030\nthe cell is very flexible,\naccommodates a lot of data.\n\n302\n00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:10.680\nBut here we do have to think about what we\ncall data types, off what type is a data.\n\n303\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.970\nThe reason is,\n\n304\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:17.140\nwhen you start creating relationships\nbetween piece of data between tables,\n\n305\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:22.028\nyou actually have to be sure that\nthose fields are of the same type.\n\n306\n00:17:22.028 --> 00:17:27.260\nOtherwise Access starts behaving in a very\nstrange way and you won't even understand.\n\n307\n00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.980\nSo data types are going\nto be very important.\n\n308\n00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.080\nOf what type is the data that\nyou will store in that field,\n\n309\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.230\nit's a very important thing.\n\n310\n00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.930\nLet's just take an example.\n\n311\n00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:43.170\nSo there's ID,\nwhich is the fourth text that I put there.\n\n312\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:48.390\nI'm just gonna change it a little bit,\nand call it student ID, so\n\n313\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.470\nthat I can remember what ID was it anyway.\n\n314\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:56.360\nYou don't like it, it can be national ID,\nI'm gonna call it student ID for now.\n\n315\n00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.358\nThen, there is a section here,\nthat's a field net, so\n\n316\n00:17:59.358 --> 00:18:04.250\nI want you to imagine that we've\nbasically taken the table and flipped it.\n\n317\n00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.010\nAnd now, we're beginning to look at\neach of those potential columns,\n\n318\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.670\nthe fields, right?\n\n319\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.490\nSo now, we are naming the fields.\n\n320\n00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.420\nSo we have the field name and\nwe have a data type.\n\n321\n00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:21.060\nIf I click that Data Type, that Box over\nthere, I've got several types of data.\n\n322\n00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:27.650\nYou can have data which is text,\nwhich means you can't auto-increment it.\n\n323\n00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.080\nYou cannot, I'm one to each text.\n\n324\n00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.930\nSo we can have name, we can have numbers,\nwe can have date and time,\n\n325\n00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.450\nwe can have currency.\n\n326\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.290\nAnd I'm very sure by the time\nwe work on Excel sheets you\n\n327\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.880\nmay have noticed that with\nan element of data type there.\n\n328\n00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.450\nSo just think about layout,\n\n329\n00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.190\nI mean we're not gonna spend time\ntrying to understand all of them.\n\n330\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:54.710\nBut let me pick text, see what happen\ndown here, even text has characteristics.\n\n331\n00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.970\nWe can want to say,\nhow many characters would be in that text?\n\n332\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.159\nWhat format do we want\nto see in that text?\n\n333\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.020\nIs it mandatory?\n\n334\n00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.230\nIs gonna be optional?\n\n335\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.260\nMust we put a value there or not?\n\n336\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.570\nSo there are many things we\ncan describe about that text.\n\n337\n00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.230\nAnd then over here we have an opportunity\nto put the descriptions, so\n\n338\n00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.870\nthat maybe later when I open the design,\nI say so\n\n339\n00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.670\nwhat exactly was that\nstudent ID supposed to mean?\n\n340\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.110\nIt was the student, maybe students\nhave two different types of IDs.\n\n341\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.390\nMaybe they have an ID\nwhich is national and\n\n342\n00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.450\nthey probably have an institutional ID.\n\n343\n00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.440\nSo I want to describe there so\nthat I can remember later.\n\n344\n00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.880\nThat was the student ID,\nnot the national ID, something like that.\n\n345\n00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.020\nSo for purposes of the student ID,\nI am going to call it AutoNumber.\n\n346\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.600\nNow, the reason I say AutoNumber is that\nI want it to automatically increment.\n\n347\n00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.720\nThat's just an example, it's suddenly\nnot always the best way to list\n\n348\n00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.420\nout the student number, because there's\nprobably a structure for student numbers.\n\n349\n00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.100\nBut AutoNumber just gives me\nan opportunity to automatically\n\n350\n00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.410\nincrement numbers by one, that's it.\n\n351\n00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.280\nThen I'm going to add another\nfield which is student name,\n\n352\n00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.190\nlet's say StudentFirstName, okay.\n\n353\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:16.320\nYou can guess the default\ndata type there is text,\n\n354\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.070\nit seems to make sense to me,\nit will be text.\n\n355\n00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:24.050\nI don't know if some people have names\nthat have numerical values in there,\n\n356\n00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.216\nprobably not maybe not.\n\n357\n00:20:26.216 --> 00:20:30.690\nBut let's say, it's in the event that\nthere are people who have names with\n\n358\n00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.789\nsome numbers in there,\nwe're gonna choose a different type.\n\n359\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.170\nI don't see that one, we'll probably call\nit memo which give us an opportunity to\n\n360\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.060\nmix different things there.\n\n361\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.980\nAlpha numerics are normally the data\ntype that is used for mixed.\n\n362\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.310\nLet's just call it text for\n\n363\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:50.830\nnow, after all text allow us to even\ndo number in there, not a problem.\n\n364\n00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.560\nAnd then we're gonna say StudentLastName,\nokay.\n\n365\n00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.310\nI'll call it the text.\n\n366\n00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.912\nLet's also decide that we're gonna\nhave student middle initial.\n\n367\n00:21:07.054 --> 00:21:11.675\nNow, of course, it's not necessary\nthat I type the whole name,\n\n368\n00:21:11.675 --> 00:21:16.900\nwhatever you wanna call it, as long\nas you'll alway remember what it is.\n\n369\n00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.380\nSome people would say s middle name,\n\n370\n00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.540\nother will just say middle name,\nwhatever it will be.\n\n371\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.240\nNow because a certain middle initial,\nI've actually requested it's gonna be one\n\n372\n00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.450\ninitial, so maybe I might just look for\nan easier way to represent this.\n\n373\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:35.450\nI can say, okay, it's text but then I can\ncome down here and say the field size,\n\n374\n00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:40.586\nwhich is gonna determine how much space\nI'm reserving for that character.\n\n375\n00:21:40.586 --> 00:21:46.450\nIt will be one, because why would\nyou want to reserve 255 spaces\n\n376\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.600\nin memory for\npurposes of only one character.\n\n377\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.330\nSo we can simplify that and\nsay I just want one.\n\n378\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.060\nSo I'll stop there, well maybe let me\njust add one more and say date of birth.\n\n379\n00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.160\nSo I'll say DOB, date of birth and\n\n380\n00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.530\nthen I'll go ahead and\nsay it is of the type Date/Time.\n\n381\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.730\nAnd then if I wanted a format,\nI can create a format down here.\n\n382\n00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.210\nSo for now because of time\nwe're gonna stop there.\n\n383\n00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:15.412\nSo we have a table and\nthen I'll save it, Ctrl+S and\n\n384\n00:22:15.412 --> 00:22:18.690\nthen I'll come and look at the view.\n\n385\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:23.070\nNow that the view has been created for\nme already wow, really cool.\n\n386\n00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.840\nSo I've got first name, last name,\nmiddle initial, date of birth and\n\n387\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.920\nit's of the type date.\n\n388\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.940\nLet's try and enter some data right here.\n\n389\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.100\nSo I go to student,\nsee what happens to student ID.\n\n390\n00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.170\nRemember it was auto increments, so\n\n391\n00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.960\nI'm gonna say Tonny, automatically\nmy student ID has been entered.\n\n392\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.370\nI go there and say Omwansa,\nI move there and say T, K,\n\n393\n00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:50.253\nI move over there in say date of bars and\n[NOISE] Pick some date there we go.\n\n394\n00:22:50.253 --> 00:22:53.151\nDone, Enter, what happen?\n\n395\n00:22:53.151 --> 00:22:58.372\nTakes me to the next row automatically I\ndon't need to worry the student ID again.\n\n396\n00:22:58.372 --> 00:23:03.596\nI say Mathew, Collins, J, then I put in\n\n397\n00:23:03.596 --> 00:23:08.940\nthe date there, damn, now I have data.\n\n398\n00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.960\nIf I go to Design View same format,\nnothing has changed.\n\n399\n00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.990\nIf I open the table again there we go,\nit's already stored that data for\n\n400\n00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.140\nme, all right?\n\n401\n00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.160\nSo I've got one table.\n\n402\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:26.120\nWow, Ronnie maybe you have some\nthoughts about creating tables and\n\n403\n00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.280\nthe experience that we've just had.\n\n404\n00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.290\n>> Now there is a couple of different ways\nthat we can actually create the tables.\n\n405\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:36.160\nIf you wanted to and\nthis is not the preferred way I would say,\n\n406\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.800\nyou can just start saying I know I'm\ngonna need the table on students.\n\n407\n00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.720\nAnd you might say here is\nthe information I want to see and\n\n408\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.220\njust start typing in your information.\n\n409\n00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.490\nAnd then you can go back later on and\n\n410\n00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.780\nactually name those particular\nfields the way that you want to.\n\n411\n00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.274\nNow, that might seem like yeah,\nthat's exactly what I would do.\n\n412\n00:23:51.274 --> 00:23:54.477\nBut when you do that you still\nhave to actually go back and\n\n413\n00:23:54.477 --> 00:23:56.728\nchange some of those elements that Dr.\n\n414\n00:23:56.728 --> 00:24:00.904\nOmwansa was talking about,\nsuch as limiting the number of characters.\n\n415\n00:24:00.904 --> 00:24:04.472\nSo the recommendation here and\nthe best way of doing it is the way Dr.\n\n416\n00:24:04.472 --> 00:24:05.544\nOmwansa showed us.\n\n417\n00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:08.917\nWhich is to go into the design view and\nthen you go ahead and\n\n418\n00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:13.489\nyou premake all of your field names that\nyou have available for you there, and\n\n419\n00:24:13.489 --> 00:24:17.006\nthen you set all of those field\nproperties underneath, and\n\n420\n00:24:17.006 --> 00:24:21.576\nthat way when you start doing the data\nentry, everything is set up the way that\n\n421\n00:24:21.576 --> 00:24:26.910\nyou want without having actually realized\nthat you're gonna change it later on.\n\n422\n00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:31.830\nSo you're setting those particular types\ndown there in the field properties so\n\n423\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:36.260\nthat your database will be constructed\nvery clearly and the way that you want to.\n\n424\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:41.120\nThe only hint that I would also suggest\nthough, is because of the way that\n\n425\n00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.370\nqueries work a little bit later on as we\nget to them is that on those field names,\n\n426\n00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:51.910\nmake sure you name them as a single word\nand you do not add spaces into them.\n\n427\n00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.670\nNow, can you add spaces?\n\n428\n00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:56.730\nYou go, no Ronnie,\nI would like to see spaces in them.\n\n429\n00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.160\nWell they recommend instead that\nyou put an underscore in between.\n\n430\n00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.110\nSo for example, the field that Dr.\nOmwansa showed us was date of birth.\n\n431\n00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:09.880\nIf you say I wanna see the word date and\nthen space, the word of and\n\n432\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.560\nthen of course space, and\nthe word birth, you can do that, but\n\n433\n00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.590\nthe recommendation is that you put in\nan actual underscore in between that, and\n\n434\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:23.820\nthat is because later on as you create\nqueries, spaces cause problems.\n\n435\n00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.040\nAnd then you have to troubleshoot\nwhat that problem is gonna be so\n\n436\n00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:33.210\nthe way the Dr. Omwanza showed us was to\nessentially push it all together without\n\n437\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:38.090\nactually any spaces in between and that\nway will actually be very helpful as well.\n\n438\n00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.095\nSo creating tables is really the first\nstep and then once you start creating\n\n439\n00:25:42.095 --> 00:25:44.600\nmultiple tables that's where\nwe're actually heading next.\n\n440\n00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.270\nSo Doctor Omwanza what do we need to know\nnow that we understand at least the basics\n\n441\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.110\nof creating a table here.\n\n442\n00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.190\n>> All right, so\nlet's go back to my computer and\n\n443\n00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.400\nI have put together two tables.\n\n444\n00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.740\nQuickly just put in two tables.\n\n445\n00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:04.950\nLet's assume that I have,\nlet me remove this one okay so,\n\n446\n00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:12.330\nlet's assume that I was interested\nin working with two tables.\n\n447\n00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.610\nOne of them being courses and\nthe other one students.\n\n448\n00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.542\nSo as you can tell my student\ntable is what we created.\n\n449\n00:26:19.542 --> 00:26:24.697\nNow I have the student courses and the\ncourses students have potentially taken.\n\n450\n00:26:24.697 --> 00:26:29.669\nIf you look at the design\nI have student ID\n\n451\n00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:34.641\nas we say, that is unique identifier for\n\n452\n00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:39.466\nthat table and then I go to the courses,\n\n453\n00:26:39.466 --> 00:26:44.584\nI've got the course ID as my primary key,\n\n454\n00:26:44.584 --> 00:26:49.140\nall right, the unique identifier.\n\n455\n00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:57.480\nNow, it's important that we understand\nthis concept of the unique identifier.\n\n456\n00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.785\nWe may have mentioned it back\nthrough the unique identifier, and\n\n457\n00:27:01.785 --> 00:27:08.210\nit gives us an opportunity\nto uniquely identify rules.\n\n458\n00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:13.450\nEvery rule will be unique, and that now\nbrings in a different intelligence that\n\n459\n00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:19.000\nthe Access database provides over and\nabove, a simple spreadsheet.\n\n460\n00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.640\nSo I can uniquely identify fields.\n\n461\n00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.170\nOnce I have this field,\nit means the in one way or another,\n\n462\n00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.610\nthe entire row will be unique.\n\n463\n00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:31.230\nSo, if I match it to something\nelse at another, in another table,\n\n464\n00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.070\nI will always know there's only\none row that will be like that.\n\n465\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.280\nThat doesn't mean that some\nthings we've been there or\n\n466\n00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.390\nwill not be the same as another row\nthere can, but when you think about\n\n467\n00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:46.520\nthe entire row it's unique because\nof that primary key, all right?\n\n468\n00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.610\nSo that gives us an idea.\n\n469\n00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.990\nSo now we can create several tables\nover here, it's not a problem.\n\n470\n00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.250\nWe can create many tables\ndepending on what we want.\n\n471\n00:27:54.330 --> 00:28:01.540\nNow, at this second tab for\ncreating we can use wizards.\n\n472\n00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.380\nWe currently used the design version.\n\n473\n00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.430\nSo, where you create it yourself.\n\n474\n00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.790\nAnd it's always good to know what exactly\nis happening in the background before\n\n475\n00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.708\nyou use wizards.\n\n476\n00:28:10.708 --> 00:28:14.990\nOf course wizards can very quickly create\nfor you things, you just select stuff and\n\n477\n00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.220\nthen you have something\nat the end of the day.\n\n478\n00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.630\nBut, we encourage that for\npurposes of learning and\n\n479\n00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:23.440\nunderstanding, it's good to\nplay with the design version.\n\n480\n00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.720\nSo, you create the tables yourself.\n\n481\n00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.460\nNow as you can right across here there's\nan opportunity to create tables.\n\n482\n00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:35.369\nSo, you can design tables,\nyou can go ahead and design queries,\n\n483\n00:28:35.369 --> 00:28:40.725\nyou can use query Wizard, you can\ncreate forms, you can design forms,\n\n484\n00:28:40.725 --> 00:28:45.297\nand you can have a blank form and\nplay then you around with it.\n\n485\n00:28:45.297 --> 00:28:49.684\nSo all these options exist here, so\nthere are tables, there are queries,\n\n486\n00:28:49.684 --> 00:28:53.970\nthere are forms, there are reports,\nthere are macros and code.\n\n487\n00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.850\nBut don't worry about\nthat towards the end.\n\n488\n00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:01.970\nSo I hope that that overall layout gives\nyou a sense that you can possibly create\n\n489\n00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.380\nnext several things,\ndepending on what exactly you want.\n\n490\n00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.890\nDo you wanna say anything along\nthose lines, or that's good?\n\n491\n00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:11.940\n>> Yeah.\nLet's talk on that unique identifier\n\n492\n00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.810\nagain, cuz I know that when I first got\nstarted into working with databases,\n\n493\n00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.250\nit was very difficult for\nme to understand.\n\n494\n00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.370\nEspecially when you mention\nlike a tables club students.\n\n495\n00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:25.370\nIt is very possible, and I've run\ninto this not just with students, but\n\n496\n00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:30.680\nactually at companies in which\nsomebody was named John C Smith, and\n\n497\n00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:36.290\nthen later on I looked at that table, and\nsomebody else was named John C Smith.\n\n498\n00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.580\nAnd actually,\n\n499\n00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:43.520\nI found a single company that had\nabout 26 people named John C Smith.\n\n500\n00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.400\nWell they all worked for\nthe same company, and so\n\n501\n00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.670\nif they are to receive\ntheir particular wages for\n\n502\n00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:54.320\nthat week or that month, we have to\nbe able to uniquely identify them.\n\n503\n00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.118\nAnd that's what that unique\nidentifier column that Dr.\n\n504\n00:29:58.118 --> 00:30:00.850\nOmwansa was talking about is important.\n\n505\n00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:05.390\nIn every single database, we have at\nleast one field that will help us\n\n506\n00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.520\nto uniquely identify\neach of those records.\n\n507\n00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.670\nAnd it also provides for\nus a constraint as well.\n\n508\n00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.790\nOnce you create that and you actually do\nmark that column as being your unique\n\n509\n00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:21.770\nidentifier, it really does, by using\nthat primary key, even if everything\n\n510\n00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:26.700\nelse is the same, and it can possibly be,\nyou might actually have John C Smith that\n\n511\n00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.640\nmay be even living in the same house or in\nthe same district or whatever it might be,\n\n512\n00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.220\nwell all of a sudden, you actually have so\nmany matching fields.\n\n513\n00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.970\nBut with that unique identifier,\nit ensures that that one record isn't\n\n514\n00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:42.770\nactually unique, and that way,\neven two particular weeks' wages,\n\n515\n00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:46.030\nthey're actually gonna be sent to\nthe right employee at the right time.\n\n516\n00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.260\nSo it's very important\nthat we understand that.\n\n517\n00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:52.030\nThe constraint that it offers though,\nis also this ability\n\n518\n00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:56.420\nto ensure that uniqueness, so\nthat you don't have duplicates that go in,\n\n519\n00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.080\nand then somebody else says,\nno, that's a duplicate record.\n\n520\n00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.510\nBut then when you realize\nit's actually two different,\n\n521\n00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.660\nunique IDs,\nthat's what will actually help us out and\n\n522\n00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.060\nthat's why it's so very important that we\nunderstand that when creating the tables.\n\n523\n00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.840\nThe other things that we mentioned\nessentially you'll see are almost\n\n524\n00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.250\nidentical to creating the tables.\n\n525\n00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.580\nSo when we start talking\nabout the queries,\n\n526\n00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.180\nonce we actually have the tables created,\nyou'll see that you can pick from those\n\n527\n00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:24.855\ndifferent fields of the information that\nand you want to gather together, and\n\n528\n00:31:24.855 --> 00:31:28.470\nthen you will also give us that\nspreadsheet like output that Dr.\n\n529\n00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:33.345\nOmwansa has been talking about, or if you\nchoose to create a report later on, and\n\n530\n00:31:33.345 --> 00:31:38.955\ndesign it into the format that you want to\nit still works in just about the same way.\n\n531\n00:31:38.955 --> 00:31:40.915\nYou have a more graphical design,\n\n532\n00:31:40.915 --> 00:31:44.670\njust like you also have with forms and,\nbut you'll also be able to create it\n\n533\n00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.540\njust about in the same way\nin that design view as well.\n\n534\n00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:52.440\nSo it's a little bit more challenging in\nterms of the number of things you have\n\n535\n00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.810\nto accomplish to make a database\nat the very beginning so\n\n536\n00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.430\nit's not like a Word document, right?\n\n537\n00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:02.830\nSo if you contrast that, a Word\ndocument you simply start typing and\n\n538\n00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.360\nthen you can format it,\nand you're ready to go.\n\n539\n00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.060\nInside of Access, you do have to\nunderstand logically what's put in there\n\n540\n00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.130\nfirst, and then of course then create\nthe structures to make it all work.\n\n541\n00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:17.870\nSo you have to actually understand\na bit more in just the general concepts\n\n542\n00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.310\nto ensure that Access works in\nthe way that you need it to but it,\n\n543\n00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.030\njust a little bit more complex.\n\n544\n00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.508\nIt's not that it can't be done,\nI definitely learned it, and\n\n545\n00:32:25.508 --> 00:32:27.530\nthat means that you can learn it as well.\n\n546\n00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:31.750\n>> Absolutely, so what we've done\nis we've gone systematically to\n\n547\n00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.640\ndemonstrate how to create a simple\ndatabase and also have tables.\n\n548\n00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.410\nAnd we've tried gently to go through\nsome of the fundamentals that we need to\n\n549\n00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.880\nappreciate, what does the overall\ndatabase gonna look like?\n\n550\n00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.040\nHave forms, row, have queries,\nhave reports, etc.\n\n551\n00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.060\nAnd we've gone ahead and created a simple\ntable, and we've explained a little bit\n\n552\n00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:57.840\nabout, what are the fields, what\nare different data types, how do you name?\n\n553\n00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.470\nWe call that the naming convention.\n\n554\n00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:03.160\nYou can create your own convention if\nit makes it easy for you to follow\n\n555\n00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.000\nthrough what exactly you need and when\nyou send such a database to someone else\n\n556\n00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.240\nthey can get to see what the tables look\nlike, what the fields look like, what\n\n557\n00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.260\nare the characteristics of each othersd\nfields, what are the data types for\n\n558\n00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.855\nthose fields, what are the descriptions\nfor each of those fields.\n\n559\n00:33:17.855 --> 00:33:23.130\nSo as it always is we don't take too\nmuch time we're going step by step we're\n\n560\n00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.900\ngoing to close this show so you understand\nthat we still have some work to do.\n\n561\n00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.450\nSo when we get back we'll now\nagain focus on a little bit about\n\n562\n00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.590\nqueries a little bit about forms and\n\n563\n00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:37.040\nwe will try to put together that\ndata base that we can ship to you.\n\n564\n00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.240\n>> Sounds like a great idea for\nus coming back for another part on Access.\n\n565\n00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.860\nSo it's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n566\n00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.379\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n567\n00:33:48.379 --> 00:33:51.948\n>> And my name is Dr.\nTonny Omwansa, enjoying learning together.\n\n568\n00:33:51.948 --> 00:33:56.684\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore computing fundamentals.\n\n569\n00:33:56.684 --> 00:34:05.280\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:20.007\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and you're\nwatching the computer fundamentals IC3\n\n4\n00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:25.401\nshow where we are taking a look at well,\na part three in Microsoft access 2010.\n\n5\n00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:27.536\nAnd the reason why is\nit's such a big program.\n\n6\n00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:31.272\nThere's a lot more for us to cover,\nbut since we've already had Dr.\n\n7\n00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:34.313\nOmwansa here with us for\nthe first part one and part two.\n\n8\n00:00:34.313 --> 00:00:38.137\nIt's only right that we actually invite\nhim back to actually help us with our\n\n9\n00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:38.809\npart three.\n\n10\n00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.891\nDr. Omwansa, welcome back to our studio.\n\n11\n00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:42.480\n>> Thank you very much for having me.\n\n12\n00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.370\nIt's been fun.\n\n13\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.680\nWe've covered two phases of this.\n\n14\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.640\nIt's because we know that we to\ngo gently in Microsoft success.\n\n15\n00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.250\nAnd now, we're at phase three.\n\n16\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.280\nAnd I think we'll be wrapping up the whole\njourney of Microsoft Access and we'll\n\n17\n00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.916\nbelieve we'll have empowered one another\nto be more productive using databases.\n\n18\n00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:02.520\n>> So we've all ready taken\na look then in parts one and\n\n19\n00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.050\ntwo of course about the fundamental\nconcepts and then even part two we\n\n20\n00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.270\nstarted to show you how you begin to\ncreate a Microsoft Access database.\n\n21\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.038\nShowed you where you could create\nwith different templates, but\n\n22\n00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:16.269\nthen Dr Omwansa also showed us where\nwe could begin by just creating tables.\n\n23\n00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:19.776\nAnd then add in additional elements and\nthat's what we're about to take a look at\n\n24\n00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:23.453\nnow, are some of the additional elements\nbesides the idea of just creating tables.\n\n25\n00:01:23.453 --> 00:01:25.567\nNow Dr Omwansa,\nwhere are we gonna start today?\n\n26\n00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:28.160\n>> Right,\nwe're gonna go into relationships.\n\n27\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.770\nWe just wanna try and\nimplement relationships.\n\n28\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.490\nSo what I've done, is that I've queried\na simple database on my computer.\n\n29\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.310\nAnd I'm going to use it to\ndemonstrate relationships,\n\n30\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.130\nbefore we can move into forms.\n\n31\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.290\nAnd then we can think about queries and\nreports.\n\n32\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.400\nSo right on my computer now\nI created this different,\n\n33\n00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.670\nsimple database that has some\nlittle bit of information.\n\n34\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.150\nIt has three tables and\nI have a table called Customers,\n\n35\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.311\nanother one called Order and\nanother one called OrderDetails.\n\n36\n00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:03.762\nLet me explain that.\n\n37\n00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:08.517\nI want a customer who goes to\na superstore, a supermarket, or\n\n38\n00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:10.610\ngoes and shops online.\n\n39\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.740\nSo I have to identify the customer\nusing the basic details of ID,\n\n40\n00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.930\nname, whatever it may be.\n\n41\n00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.610\nThen secondly, that customer\nis going to make an order, and\n\n42\n00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.450\nthat customer can make more than\none order over a period of time.\n\n43\n00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.560\nSo there is something called orders, so\n\n44\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.410\nthere is an entity that\nI'm calling orders.\n\n45\n00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.020\nSo now we have two entities so far.\n\n46\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.190\nCustomer, order,\n\n47\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.340\nthen within a specific order\na customer can order several products.\n\n48\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.480\nSo this order was done on 30th at two\no'clock but it had several products.\n\n49\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.620\nSo within those, that particular order\nthat might be say five products and\n\n50\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.990\nproduct therefore becomes\nthe thought entity.\n\n51\n00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.800\nSo what I am now doing is that\nI have a typical customers,\n\n52\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.930\nI have a typical orders and I have typical\n\n53\n00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.910\norder details where I'll cut to\nthe details of that particular order.\n\n54\n00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.770\nIncluding the number of\nproducts that were captured,\n\n55\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.880\nthe price of each of those products and\nso on and so forth.\n\n56\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.670\nSo let's start by looking\nat the table Customers.\n\n57\n00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.140\nI've made it very simple.\n\n58\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.498\nI have simply put two fields,\nCustomer ID, and I call it the digitype\n\n59\n00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:24.690\nis gonna be Auto Number, and then I have\na Customer First Name which is text.\n\n60\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.596\nThat's it.\n\n61\n00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:29.863\nFor your information, we can't have\nmore than one primary key in a table so\n\n62\n00:03:29.863 --> 00:03:34.468\nif you try to change the primary key, for\nexample, I try to change the primary key\n\n63\n00:03:34.468 --> 00:03:39.101\nto customer first name, what happens is\nthat the first primary key disappears.\n\n64\n00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.130\nThe one which was on customer ID.\n\n65\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.970\nSo you only have one primary key.\n\n66\n00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.720\nNow it is possible to have a combinational\nfield to be a primary key.\n\n67\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.010\nLet's leave that for now.\n\n68\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.250\nThat means a composite key but\nwe'll complicate things for now.\n\n69\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.099\nSo for now we're just working\nwith one primary key per table.\n\n70\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.073\nThen we open my second table\nis going to be orders.\n\n71\n00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:06.735\nSo if I open orders and look at\nthe design it just has the order idea,\n\n72\n00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:11.483\nit has the order date, it has\nthe amount that's the total amount for\n\n73\n00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:14.630\nthat order and\nthen it has the customer ID.\n\n74\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.890\nSo I call it order customer ID, so\n\n75\n00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.060\nthat I know which customer actually\nordered this particular order, all right?\n\n76\n00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.670\nNow if you think about it there's\na relationship therefore between\n\n77\n00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.000\nthe order table and the customer table.\n\n78\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.340\nAnd the field that will link\nthe two tables is the order ID\n\n79\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.250\nin the customer and\nthe order customer ID in my order table.\n\n80\n00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.570\nLet's go to the third table\nwhich is order details.\n\n81\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.640\nAnd then I go to the design mode.\n\n82\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.180\nIt has two fields I just put in there.\n\n83\n00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.740\nIt has the order details ID and\nI have the order ID.\n\n84\n00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.436\nMaybe if I'm a nice guy,\nI'll also say product name.\n\n85\n00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:05.330\nSo that it's clear that this is\ngoing to be about specific products.\n\n86\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.200\nSo fine, so it's going to be text.\n\n87\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.088\nSo I have three fields.\n\n88\n00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:13.623\nSo now the relationship\nbetween the order details and\n\n89\n00:05:13.623 --> 00:05:18.912\nthe order is that the primary\nkey in the orders table\n\n90\n00:05:18.912 --> 00:05:24.694\ncalled OrderID will be used\nin the order details table.\n\n91\n00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:26.831\nSo that they can tell me ha,\n\n92\n00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:32.400\nthese are the products that were actually\nordered in that particular order.\n\n93\n00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.090\nSo I will carry this key to that place.\n\n94\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.690\nNow you don't remove it and take it there.\n\n95\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.950\nWe retain it here.\n\n96\n00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.210\nBut then we also list it there and\nthen we're going to match the two.\n\n97\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.850\nSo we're going to learn\ntwo things right now.\n\n98\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.040\nOne is the foreign key.\n\n99\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.547\nSo when we take a key into another\ntable that we will use to relate with\n\n100\n00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:59.156\nthe primary key of the parent table,\nwe call it a foreign key in that table.\n\n101\n00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:03.490\nThere are other notations that I\nuse to explain that simple concept.\n\n102\n00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:10.120\nBut let's call it the foreign key in\nthe child table so to speak and then\n\n103\n00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.380\nthe second thing is that now we will use\nthose two keys to create a relationship.\n\n104\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.340\nSo we have introduced a new\nconcept called relationships and\n\n105\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.050\nhow do we do relationships?\n\n106\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.679\nWe've got a function here\nwhen we go to the Tables,\n\n107\n00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:27.919\nlet me just close all these for now.\n\n108\n00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.112\nI go to Design > Tools.\n\n109\n00:06:31.112 --> 00:06:33.730\nSo it helps me to design the database.\n\n110\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.000\nSo the database design tools.\n\n111\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.920\nThen I find something under\nRelationship called Relationships.\n\n112\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.370\nSo I click it.\n\n113\n00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.425\nAnd it brings up the three tables.\n\n114\n00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:46.513\nYou will see three tabs there, tables.\n\n115\n00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:47.871\nQueries, both.\n\n116\n00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:50.610\nSo if I go to the tables,\nlet's just keep it simple.\n\n117\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.390\nWe're working with tables.\n\n118\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.130\nAnd I click on button.\n\n119\n00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.650\nIt puts in some\nrepresentation of that table.\n\n120\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.350\nI select the second one.\n\n121\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.510\nAnd I select the third one and click add.\n\n122\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.170\nAnd I close it.\n\n123\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.920\nNow, I have the three tables.\n\n124\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.940\nIt's good to think about the sequence.\n\n125\n00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.300\nSo the sequence is such, they started\nwith customers and then I have orders.\n\n126\n00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.640\nSo I can move things around, and\nthen I finally have the order details.\n\n127\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.360\nSo it means one customer can\nmake several orders, and\n\n128\n00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.760\nso an order can have several order\nproducts or order details for that matter.\n\n129\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.170\nSo we're gonna build relationships.\n\n130\n00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.840\nNow we've got primary key here.\n\n131\n00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.910\nSo creating relationships is very easy.\n\n132\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:38.080\nSo I'm gonna click this ID here and\nhold the cursor down or the mouse down.\n\n133\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.510\nDrag to the next table.\n\n134\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.930\nBut I want to relate it\nto a particular field so\n\n135\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.165\nI'm going to pick Order Customer ID and\nthen I release.\n\n136\n00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:52.351\nAutomatically access picks the\nintelligence and says you are trying to\n\n137\n00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:58.076\nrelate this table and this table and these\nother fields that you're trying to relate.\n\n138\n00:07:58.076 --> 00:07:59.247\nOkay.\n\n139\n00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:01.862\nThat's great, we can allow you to do that.\n\n140\n00:08:01.862 --> 00:08:05.280\nNow, there are some guidelines\nwe want to give access so\n\n141\n00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.140\nthat it knows what we want to achieve.\n\n142\n00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.180\nSo, let's think about it.\n\n143\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.100\nWhat if you have some older\ndetails in the table of.\n\n144\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.035\nOkay, let's do, we have some\norders in the table of orders.\n\n145\n00:08:20.035 --> 00:08:28.930\nAnd we have no customers\nin the table of customers.\n\n146\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.870\nSo who's products, who made this order?\n\n147\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.180\nThen it becomes very\ndifficult to figure out.\n\n148\n00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.880\nIn fact so why did you save those orders\nin the first place if we can't know who's\n\n149\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.600\nthe owner of this order.\n\n150\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.290\nSo we would like to enforce a requirement\n\n151\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:48.220\nthat every time we have data in the order\ndetails it must have a relationship.\n\n152\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.550\nIt must have real data\nabout who made that order.\n\n153\n00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.925\nSo we must, otherwise then it's\ngoing to be a very useful tool.\n\n154\n00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:58.945\nThat's where we have access so\nwe can enforce those relationships.\n\n155\n00:08:58.945 --> 00:09:01.655\nOtherwise you end up with\na lot of data in the table and\n\n156\n00:09:01.655 --> 00:09:05.955\nyou just can't trace what's the source,\nwhat's the origin, what's the connection.\n\n157\n00:09:05.955 --> 00:09:09.664\nSo we're going to enforce\nreferential integrity.\n\n158\n00:09:09.664 --> 00:09:16.588\nSo I'm going to select a check box here\nthat enables us to enforce integrity.\n\n159\n00:09:16.588 --> 00:09:21.090\nCuz the integrity of data is important,\nyou don't want data for the sake of data.\n\n160\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.220\nSo you want to enforce some\nguidelines around that data.\n\n161\n00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.064\nSo I've selected that referential\nintegrity there are few other options\n\n162\n00:09:29.064 --> 00:09:30.398\nthat I've come up.\n\n163\n00:09:30.398 --> 00:09:34.584\nCascade update related fields and\ncascade related deals.\n\n164\n00:09:34.584 --> 00:09:40.022\nLet's not worry too much about that but\nthe simple point about this is that every\n\n165\n00:09:40.022 --> 00:09:45.560\ntime you make a change in a parent table\nit can be reflected in the child's table.\n\n166\n00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.500\nFor example if I changed\nthe Customer ID and\n\n167\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.560\nthat customer ID was actually used\nin the order table as a foreign key.\n\n168\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.600\nThen if we say\nCascade Update Related Fields it means\n\n169\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.110\ngo update that fields otherwise\nyou'll lose integrity again.\n\n170\n00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.160\nYou might just have some foreign key\nthere that doesn't have its parent key.\n\n171\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.350\nSo that's why you enforce\nsome of those things.\n\n172\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.670\nFor now, let's not go into that.\n\n173\n00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.590\nWe want to demonstrate first\nall our appreciation of this.\n\n174\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.290\nSo we have gone ahead and I click Create.\n\n175\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.250\nWow, I can see there is something called\none and then a sign here, infinity, right?\n\n176\n00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:29.470\nIt means one customer has a relationship\nwhere they can have many orders.\n\n177\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.170\nSo that relationship\nis called one to many.\n\n178\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.500\nSo we can create many, many orders.\n\n179\n00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.650\nThere is no limit, really.\n\n180\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:41.310\nNow let's do the same thing, because that\norder can have several products in there.\n\n181\n00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.350\nSo we take that order as well.\n\n182\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.980\nWe hold down,\ndrag to the order ID and release, and\n\n183\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.700\nthen we enforce integrity and\nthen we say Create.\n\n184\n00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.120\nWow, now we already\nhave something related.\n\n185\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.380\nWe have one too many and one too many.\n\n186\n00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.760\nSo it means one customer can\nhave numerous order products.\n\n187\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.040\nThat was product have associated\nwith particular orders.\n\n188\n00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.170\nSo I hope you've seen some\nlogical explanation to\n\n189\n00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.100\nthis of how now data is being\nstructured and being related.\n\n190\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.580\nAnd then now, and we stop populating\ndata we're just gonna go into that.\n\n191\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.550\nWe'll create a form,\nwe stop populating data.\n\n192\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.190\nAnd we'll stop seeing relationships\nmanifest themselves in real data.\n\n193\n00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.110\nI'll explain this thing for a few minutes.\n\n194\n00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.700\nMaybe, Ronnie, you have some other\nthoughts as well along the same lines,\n\n195\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.540\nexperiences you've had with this?\n\n196\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.170\n>> This is one of\nthe understandings that we have\n\n197\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.380\nto have when we start working with Access.\n\n198\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.960\nWe can create all the tables that\nwe want to be able to create.\n\n199\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.750\nBut if we wanna use the power of Access so\nthat we can get\n\n200\n00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.310\nthe information out that we need, we need\nto be ablr to create these relationships.\n\n201\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.720\nUnderstanding logically the idea of\nthe relationships is absolutely key for\n\n202\n00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.550\nus but to make it work in Access,\nthis is how we do this.\n\n203\n00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:58.080\nIs by being able to take\nthe primary key of one table and\n\n204\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.320\nthen, of course, go to another table and\nbe able to find that\n\n205\n00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.370\nforeign key that we need to that will\nallow us to create those relationships.\n\n206\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.122\nNow, remember that these relationships,\nDr.\n\n207\n00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:10.510\n[INAUDIBLE] has really focused\nin on two different types here.\n\n208\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.920\nUsually, the one, the many is by\nfar the most common relationship.\n\n209\n00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.180\nA single customer being able to order\nmultiple times if they need to in\n\n210\n00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.110\ntheir orders.\n\n211\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.530\nThink about it as you maybe going shopping\none day at one of those supermarkets.\n\n212\n00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.040\nAnd then realizing when you get home my\ngosh, I needed to pick up something else.\n\n213\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.550\nWell, you as a single customer\ncan go back and do what?\n\n214\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.260\nCreate another order again as you go and\nshop and pick up again.\n\n215\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.250\nAnd the same thing can also happen where\nyou might actually only go one time.\n\n216\n00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.610\nSo you can also have a one to one\nrelationship as well in which you might\n\n217\n00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.960\nactually only purchase that one time that\nday, and that's perfectly fine as well.\n\n218\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.170\nSo these relationships\nin logical expression\n\n219\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.680\nare really what we actually\nneed to understand.\n\n220\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.570\nBut then to make it work in Access to now\nwhere I can query between those three\n\n221\n00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.180\ntables, in other words,\nget the information out.\n\n222\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.580\nWhat did that one\nparticular customer order?\n\n223\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.571\nAnd then, if I were to actually\njust look at the order,\n\n224\n00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:10.355\ncan I find out every single product\nthat that customer actually had?\n\n225\n00:13:10.355 --> 00:13:12.830\nSo we can find out the number\nof orders that they had,\n\n226\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.764\nas well as every single product\nthat they also bought as well.\n\n227\n00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:20.556\nAnd that all happens through these\nrelationship connections that we have\n\n228\n00:13:20.556 --> 00:13:21.580\nto have.\n\n229\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.960\nAlso that idea of referential\nintegrity is very important.\n\n230\n00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.110\nJust like what Dr. said here is key.\n\n231\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.680\nIf I do not establish this referential\nintegrity inside of Access.\n\n232\n00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.810\nIt means that I could\ndelete out the orders and\n\n233\n00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.470\nI might have a customer in\nthere now in my customer table.\n\n234\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.050\nAnd I'm wondering why do I have\nthis customer in here, but\n\n235\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.510\nit doesn't seem like he's\nactually made any orders.\n\n236\n00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:49.000\nIt doesn't make sense to have an order\nwithout a customer, nor does it actually\n\n237\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.480\nmake sense to have products in an order\nif there's actually no order that exist.\n\n238\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.620\nSo establishing that referential integrity\nhelps us by really allowing us to say if\n\n239\n00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:05.410\nthis is removed so also is going to be\nthis other object in that child table.\n\n240\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.460\nSo that logical understanding and\n\n241\n00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.690\nthen show me how to make\nit work inside of axis.\n\n242\n00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.250\nVery key if you're gonna be\nworking inside of Access,\n\n243\n00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.018\nespecially if you're the one\ncreating the actual database itself.\n\n244\n00:14:16.018 --> 00:14:19.510\nSo Dr having a good understanding of this.\n\n245\n00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.440\nWe now need to actually understand\na couple of more items that you\n\n246\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.720\nmentioned at the beginning of the show,\nqueries and reports.\n\n247\n00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.510\nSo what are we gonna take a look at next?\n\n248\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.590\n>> All right, so what we're gonna do.\n\n249\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.340\nIs we're gonna go an extra step just\nto demonstrate how that data has been\n\n250\n00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.460\norganized, the implications\nof those relationships.\n\n251\n00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.610\nAnd then create some forms and\nthen use that to enter data.\n\n252\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:45.600\nSo right on my computer what I've just\ndone is actually populated manually for\n\n253\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.220\nnow to demonstrate what\nexactly is happening.\n\n254\n00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.820\nSo this is the spreadsheet view.\n\n255\n00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.650\nOf my table.\n\n256\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.270\nThis is customer so\nI've added three customers.\n\n257\n00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.153\nIt's very easy to add another customer and\ncall them John.\n\n258\n00:14:59.153 --> 00:15:01.530\nAnd there we go, that's easy.\n\n259\n00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.820\nLet's go to orders.\n\n260\n00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.670\nI created some three orders.\n\n261\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.460\nAnd I enter the Customer ID here.\n\n262\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.420\nSo the Customer ID had to be between\nnumber one and number three.\n\n263\n00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.490\nI just added the fourth customer.\n\n264\n00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.760\nBut let's just try and see what happens.\n\n265\n00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.620\nSo I go.\n\n266\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.430\nI'm adding a new order.\n\n267\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.710\nAnd there you go.\n\n268\n00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.192\nI pick a date and then I say,\nwell, this is worth $30.\n\n269\n00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:25.950\nAnd then.\n\n270\n00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.460\nYou see it's customer number three as\nwell and then I go add another date.\n\n271\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:36.750\nAnd then I say just what's the 50 and then\nI say well maybe this customer number six.\n\n272\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.280\nAccess will complain.\n\n273\n00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.570\nWhy is it complaining,\nit's because you are adding [INAUDIBLE].\n\n274\n00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.230\nYou cannot add or\n\n275\n00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:49.100\nchange a record because a related record\nis required in the TBL customers.\n\n276\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.830\nThat means there must be a customer\nnumber six in the table of customers for\n\n277\n00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.130\nus to have a Customer ID\nhere of number six.\n\n278\n00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.499\nSo I'm gonna change that and say three,\nwhich is customer number three.\n\n279\n00:15:59.499 --> 00:16:02.447\nSo that is we're enforcing\nintegrity of the data.\n\n280\n00:16:02.447 --> 00:16:04.395\nThat's a demonstration.\n\n281\n00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:06.775\nSo then I close, I go to order details.\n\n282\n00:16:06.775 --> 00:16:08.851\nNow I have order details here, so\n\n283\n00:16:08.851 --> 00:16:12.520\nall the orders are ranging\nbetween number one and six.\n\n284\n00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.100\nThat means the fallen key here order\nID must range between number one and\n\n285\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.540\nsix and that's it.\n\n286\n00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.500\nSo I already have some data,\nthe next thing I could possibly do is\n\n287\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.630\nI can go to create and\nI can do many things here.\n\n288\n00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.630\nLet's just try and create a simple form.\n\n289\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.870\nNow, just to simplify\nit let's use a result,\n\n290\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.900\nwe can quickly create some of this.\n\n291\n00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:40.060\nSo we say form recent and then let's say\nI'm interested in creating customers.\n\n292\n00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.711\nSo I select the table for customers\nbecause I don't have to enter the customer\n\n293\n00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:46.600\nID because its auto number\nis automatically created.\n\n294\n00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.340\nSo I'm just gonna insert the customer\nname and then I say Next.\n\n295\n00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.000\nMaybe the format,\nwhatever I want to use as the design, and\n\n296\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.060\nthen the name that we'll want to call it.\n\n297\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:02.720\nI think I'm going to call FRM customers\nand then I finish, there I am.\n\n298\n00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.038\nNow what's happening here?\n\n299\n00:17:04.038 --> 00:17:07.147\nIf you look at the bottom here,\nthere already three,\n\n300\n00:17:07.147 --> 00:17:10.400\nfour customers already in that table,\nas I scroll.\n\n301\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.780\nSo if I had many fields,\nthey would all be reflecting here.\n\n302\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.643\nSo I can scroll and\nsee all the four customers.\n\n303\n00:17:14.643 --> 00:17:20.497\nAt this opportunity now I can add\nanother customer and say, Collins.\n\n304\n00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:25.095\nAnd then if I click next,\nalready now 6E has been inserted, so\n\n305\n00:17:25.095 --> 00:17:28.275\nI have Collins as the last customer and\nI can go back and forth.\n\n306\n00:17:28.275 --> 00:17:31.452\nThen if I want to create another\ncustomer as well, I can do it.\n\n307\n00:17:31.452 --> 00:17:37.888\nAnd if I wanna create orders and\nI want to create order details,\n\n308\n00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:44.830\nI can create as long as I can always\nrelate to existing foreign keys.\n\n309\n00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.730\nSimilarly, I can create a report.\n\n310\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:52.920\nSo let's say I want to create\na report of the orders.\n\n311\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.291\nSo I can go, create, I can see forms here.\n\n312\n00:17:56.291 --> 00:17:58.076\nI can see reports here.\n\n313\n00:17:58.076 --> 00:17:59.630\nAnd I can go to a wizard.\n\n314\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.692\nOf course, you can use whatever\nother method and manually create.\n\n315\n00:18:03.692 --> 00:18:07.010\nBut let's say I want\nto create four orders.\n\n316\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.100\nI can take all the across.\n\n317\n00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.948\nI can probably take back the order\nID if I didn't wanna put it.\n\n318\n00:18:12.948 --> 00:18:14.630\nAnd then, they'd say next.\n\n319\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.220\nNow I can play around with some of\nthe requirement formatting issues here,\n\n320\n00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.740\nyou want to group things so for now we'll\njust spare ourselves some little trouble.\n\n321\n00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.690\nIf we want to put them\ninto ascending order,\n\n322\n00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.410\ndescending order, against which field,\nall that you can put into place.\n\n323\n00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.657\nIf you want to create some\nsummaries you can create,\n\n324\n00:18:30.657 --> 00:18:33.016\nif you want to organize this\nin landscape or portrait.\n\n325\n00:18:33.016 --> 00:18:36.121\nAll those options are available, so\n\n326\n00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:41.480\nlet me just call this report rptorders and\nthen I say boom.\n\n327\n00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.560\nLet's review.\n\n328\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.590\nThere I have, very simple.\n\n329\n00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.280\nI can rename it, I can go back to\nthe design portion of this and\n\n330\n00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.750\nreorganize this and probably move things\naround and even clear aggregations and\n\n331\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.760\nsummaries and what not, and\nthen make a very nice report out of it.\n\n332\n00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.180\nSo these functions are available, I've\njust used the wizard so that we get there\n\n333\n00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:05.090\nquickly, and they're not the hard ones but\nwe have learned two important things that\n\n334\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.880\nyou can work with forms which then\nyou can use to manipulate data.\n\n335\n00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.530\nAnd then reports which you can use to\ndisplay data in an interesting and\n\n336\n00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.120\nmeaningful way that is easy to understand.\n\n337\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.561\nSo the only thing I'm gonna explain\na little more now is queries.\n\n338\n00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:24.440\nBut before I go to queries I\nwant us to understand why.\n\n339\n00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.660\nSo I'll come to why, but\n\n340\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.240\nI know Ronnie always has some ideas\nto add to this kind of things.\n\n341\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.730\nSo I like to hear some thoughts\nabout your experience working\n\n342\n00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.550\nwith your reports and forms.\n\n343\n00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.480\n>> Working with reports and\nforms, this is very important if\n\n344\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.440\nyou are designing the database for\nsomebody else to enter the data into.\n\n345\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.826\nNow, you might think well,\nnobody else is gonna do that and\n\n346\n00:19:44.826 --> 00:19:47.372\nyou're perfectly happy in working\nin that spreadsheet view.\n\n347\n00:19:47.372 --> 00:19:51.676\nGreat, but remember that when you do\nthat you still have to switch in between\n\n348\n00:19:51.676 --> 00:19:54.432\neach of those tables to\nget all the data entry in,\n\n349\n00:19:54.432 --> 00:19:57.255\ndone and completed the way that you need.\n\n350\n00:19:57.255 --> 00:19:59.384\nBy creating a form it helps you and\n\n351\n00:19:59.384 --> 00:20:04.403\nyour productivity because we can create\na form that allows us to populate all of\n\n352\n00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:09.439\nthose tables with the data that we need\nby having one major interface instead.\n\n353\n00:20:09.439 --> 00:20:13.469\nOr we can actually do multiple interfaces\nif we choose to do it in a different style\n\n354\n00:20:13.469 --> 00:20:16.583\nin a different method by\ncreating multiple forms.\n\n355\n00:20:16.583 --> 00:20:23.483\nReports are one of the major reasons\nwhy we actually have databases too.\n\n356\n00:20:23.483 --> 00:20:26.253\nThe overall idea of creating a report\n\n357\n00:20:26.253 --> 00:20:31.148\nis normally somebody needs the information\nthat is inside of our database but\n\n358\n00:20:31.148 --> 00:20:35.713\nneeds it displayed in a meaningful way so\nthat they can actually make\n\n359\n00:20:35.713 --> 00:20:40.660\na meaningful business decision based\noff of the data that's presented.\n\n360\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.160\nIf you can create a report and\n\n361\n00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:48.150\nget the exact information that,\nthat particular user needs.\n\n362\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.240\nWell that actually makes that\nprocess of productivity much better.\n\n363\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.579\nWhat you do not ever want to do\nis to create a report just for\n\n364\n00:20:55.579 --> 00:20:57.331\nthe sake of creating report.\n\n365\n00:20:57.331 --> 00:21:02.920\nSo you always have to think in terms\nof what does my audience need?\n\n366\n00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.031\nAnd in that report you can actually\ngenerate so much information that can be\n\n367\n00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:11.023\npresented meaningfully and displayed\nexactly the way that you want to.\n\n368\n00:21:11.023 --> 00:21:14.950\nThat it really is helpful because a lot\nof time just at looking at data and\n\n369\n00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.504\nthe Spreadsheet format and\njust saying yeah,\n\n370\n00:21:17.504 --> 00:21:22.220\njust pull the information out the way\nthat you want most people cannot do it.\n\n371\n00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.060\nMost of the time at the decision\nmaking level inside of businesses.\n\n372\n00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.600\nThey make their decision\nbased off of reports.\n\n373\n00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.540\nThat maybe you and I generate.\n\n374\n00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.790\nSo very important for you to slow down and\ngo back through this process again.\n\n375\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.610\nAnd to take more time in\nlearning about access\n\n376\n00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.858\nIf you're actually going to be creating\naccess types of databases as well.\n\n377\n00:21:41.858 --> 00:21:45.220\nSo Dr.\nwhere are we gonna begin with queries?\n\n378\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.790\n>> Right, we're gonna beginning with\nqueries by asking ourselves why do\n\n379\n00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.500\nwe need queries?\n\n380\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.700\nSo let's say I just created a simple\nreport a few minutes ago, and\n\n381\n00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:00.550\nall we did is, we select the data\nfrom the table, and displayed it.\n\n382\n00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.140\nNow, the table that I used\nis table of customers.\n\n383\n00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.550\nSo let's say that the report that\nI wanted needed to give me idea of\n\n384\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.520\nhow much money did each\nof those customers pay?\n\n385\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.439\nThe data about amount is available\nin the table called orders.\n\n386\n00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.600\nBut the data about the customer is\navailable in the table called Customers.\n\n387\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.440\nSo yes, there is a relationship.\n\n388\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:36.030\nBut currently, there is no mechanism of\nextracting that data from one location.\n\n389\n00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.300\nThere isn't,\nbecause it's two different tables.\n\n390\n00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.490\nSo when you try to create a report,\nyou're trying to figure out,\n\n391\n00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.440\nhow do I get that data?\n\n392\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.616\nSo now what we basically create\nare queries which provide us\n\n393\n00:22:48.616 --> 00:22:54.518\nwith a mechanism of extracting\nwhatever data we need from different\n\n394\n00:22:54.518 --> 00:22:59.506\nlocations and\nstoring it iin some temporary mechanism.\n\n395\n00:22:59.506 --> 00:23:04.492\nThat we can easily use to create reports\nor we can use to analyzed or can use to,\n\n396\n00:23:04.492 --> 00:23:09.735\nyou know, explore, what exactly\ncan be happening in the database.\n\n397\n00:23:09.735 --> 00:23:11.910\nSo now we can now start\ngetting intelligence.\n\n398\n00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.347\nYou see when you moved\nfrom data to information,\n\n399\n00:23:14.347 --> 00:23:16.780\nthis is one path towards information.\n\n400\n00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.140\nSo we were trying to get,\nwhat is exactly happening?\n\n401\n00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.350\nCan we see any trend?\n\n402\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.740\nCan we see any relationship?\n\n403\n00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.720\nSo, just simply,\nI'm interested right now in getting\n\n404\n00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:36.010\nall the customers, and\namount of money that they have spent.\n\n405\n00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.000\nSimple.\n\n406\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.250\nNow that means two different tables.\n\n407\n00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.700\nSo the query is not a new table.\n\n408\n00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.210\nIt's just a temporary\nway of extracting data.\n\n409\n00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.580\nIt doesn't hold data by itself.\n\n410\n00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.950\nSo it's basically a formula that has been\nstored somewhere with some framework and\n\n411\n00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.680\nthe structure.\n\n412\n00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:58.051\nSo every time you run it, it goes to the\nall the tables that you asked to do and\n\n413\n00:23:58.051 --> 00:24:02.166\nget the data and\nthen display it almost just like a table.\n\n414\n00:24:02.166 --> 00:24:07.067\nSo I'm interested in getting data\nfrom two different tables let's see.\n\n415\n00:24:07.067 --> 00:24:12.376\nSo, I go back to my computer, and then I\ngo to create, I now have queries here.\n\n416\n00:24:12.376 --> 00:24:16.770\nSo there are two ways of creating queries,\nI can use a wizard or I can use a design.\n\n417\n00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.540\nBased on whatever I mean to study,\nI can go ahead and do it, I can flip.\n\n418\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.920\nOnce I've created by a wizard,\n\n419\n00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.920\nI can always go back to the design and\nI can make changes if I need to.\n\n420\n00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.118\nSo let's just work with\nthe wizard right now.\n\n421\n00:24:32.118 --> 00:24:38.090\nSay, okay the wizard simply tells me,\ndo you wanna create a simple query wizard?\n\n422\n00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.220\nI said, okay fine,\n\n423\n00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:44.680\njust something simple say well,\nI want data from the Customer table.\n\n424\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.550\nWhat data do I want from there?\n\n425\n00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.940\nI want customer's first name only.\n\n426\n00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.300\nThere could have been as many as 50\nfields there, it's not an issue.\n\n427\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.440\nSo, I want the customer name.\n\n428\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.826\nAnd then I say, okay,\nso what else do I want?\n\n429\n00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:04.960\nI want to get orders,\nI want information from the orders.\n\n430\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.810\nAnd I know that it's\nrelated by the customer ID.\n\n431\n00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:12.990\nI don't need to pick the customer ID but\nI just wanna pick amount, okay fine.\n\n432\n00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:16.920\nNext, as you can tell those two fields\nare coming from two different tables.\n\n433\n00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.070\nAnd then I say Next.\n\n434\n00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.920\nOkay fine, it's asking me,\ndo you want a summary or\n\n435\n00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:28.140\ndo you want details where it will show\nyou every fields of every record?\n\n436\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.600\nThis is now where the opportunity\ncomes in where you want to start\n\n437\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.850\navoiding duplications and\nrepetitions and things like that.\n\n438\n00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.840\nBut Access has the capacity\nto manage that.\n\n439\n00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.230\nBut for now, let's just run so that we\nsee what exactly is going to happen.\n\n440\n00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:49.710\nSo next, I'm gonna call it\nquery customers, qryCustomers.\n\n441\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.602\nLet me just remove that,\nand then I say okay.\n\n442\n00:25:51.602 --> 00:25:55.241\nI want to run open the query and\nview the information.\n\n443\n00:25:55.241 --> 00:25:58.200\nAll right, it just came like a table.\n\n444\n00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.570\nIt's been created in a section of queries.\n\n445\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.100\nIt's giving me name and amount.\n\n446\n00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:09.075\nIt'll be interesting to see\nwhat is in the actual table and\n\n447\n00:26:09.075 --> 00:26:10.355\nhow does it relate to this?\n\n448\n00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:13.875\nSo I can see Tony, Ronnie, Ronnie,\nRichard, Richard, Richard.\n\n449\n00:26:15.215 --> 00:26:16.710\nLet me go to Customize.\n\n450\n00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.726\nI've got several customers here, there's\nTony, Ronnie, Richard, John, Collins.\n\n451\n00:26:21.726 --> 00:26:25.829\nIt potentially therefore tells me,\nthat probably John and\n\n452\n00:26:25.829 --> 00:26:30.436\nCollins haven't done a particular order,\nand we can prove that.\n\n453\n00:26:30.436 --> 00:26:34.820\nThis is customer ID 4,\n5 I go into orders and try to look for\n\n454\n00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.818\ncustomer ID here, 4, 5 is not there.\n\n455\n00:26:37.818 --> 00:26:40.459\nAnd as much as that\nhappened in several orders,\n\n456\n00:26:40.459 --> 00:26:44.200\nthe orders have only been\ndone by customer 1, 2, and 3.\n\n457\n00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:49.430\nSo that's why if you go to customer 1, 2,\nand 3, you'll get Tony, Ronnie, Richard.\n\n458\n00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:53.920\nSo if I go back to my query,\nTony, Ronnie, Richard.\n\n459\n00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.130\nOkay, but how come Tony is only once,\nRonnie twice, and Richard three times?\n\n460\n00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.820\nSo I go, okay,\nlet me go to the customer orders.\n\n461\n00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.450\nYou can see order customer\nID 1 is only appearing once.\n\n462\n00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.266\nThen customer ID 2 is appearing twice,\nand therefore,\n\n463\n00:27:10.266 --> 00:27:12.766\nI'm just looking at it three times.\n\n464\n00:27:12.766 --> 00:27:16.660\nAha, so it is only three customers\nwho have done transactions.\n\n465\n00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.960\nAnd they made orders of certain amounts.\n\n466\n00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.710\nNow, we can now continue to\nplay with such a query and\n\n467\n00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.930\nmake it more sophisticated, maybe stuff\nto give us the total of each customer.\n\n468\n00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.010\nIt starts to tell us\na little more details.\n\n469\n00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.690\nThat's enough for now but\nat least you've gotten a sense.\n\n470\n00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.350\nNow as you can tell this is not new data.\n\n471\n00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.760\nWhat's coming in this\nquery is not new data,\n\n472\n00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.360\nit's data that is coming\nfrom the database itself.\n\n473\n00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.520\nAnd therefore we have a query.\n\n474\n00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.730\nNow, if you want you can\nmanipulate this query.\n\n475\n00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.340\nIf you go to the design view of that\nquery we can manipulate that query.\n\n476\n00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.070\nSo I try to create a new one.\n\n477\n00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:50.900\nSo if I go to query and right-click and\n\n478\n00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.840\nthen I go to the design view,\nI now have the design view of that query.\n\n479\n00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.020\nI can see it's picking which field?\n\n480\n00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.000\nCustomer field name from this table,\nthis field from this table so\n\n481\n00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.930\nthere are two different tables.\n\n482\n00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:08.551\nI can mute if I didn't want\nsomething to appear by\n\n483\n00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:12.090\nclicking the check box over here.\n\n484\n00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:18.730\nSo a few things I can play with here and\nif I want, I can learn about SQL.\n\n485\n00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.350\nWe did mention about SQL,\n\n486\n00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:25.613\nwhich is the language that is\nused to create SQL instructions.\n\n487\n00:28:25.613 --> 00:28:27.765\nIf I right-click any section here and\n\n488\n00:28:27.765 --> 00:28:30.885\nclick SQL View,\nI can see some interesting text.\n\n489\n00:28:30.885 --> 00:28:35.194\nFor those who like programming,\nthey can see,\n\n490\n00:28:35.194 --> 00:28:40.275\nselect TBL customer,\nthe customer name, TBL orders.\n\n491\n00:28:40.275 --> 00:28:43.585\nSo that starts to sound like\na little complex language.\n\n492\n00:28:43.585 --> 00:28:46.240\nThere's some people who enjoy it,\nI think Ronnie must be one of them.\n\n493\n00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:46.940\n[LAUGH].\n\n494\n00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.094\n[LAUGH] And\nI'm selecting from TBL customers,\n\n495\n00:28:51.094 --> 00:28:58.210\ninner join TBL orders on TBL customers,\nbracket customer ID equals to TBL.\n\n496\n00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:02.110\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, sounds a little\ninteresting, complicated, but don't worry.\n\n497\n00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.690\nIt's the same thing,\nrepresented in graphical format.\n\n498\n00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:10.220\nRight always in the background, there are\ninstructions that the computer must stick.\n\n499\n00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.610\nSo the user interface simply\nmakes it easier for us.\n\n500\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.120\nSo let me not spend too\nmuch time on that one,\n\n501\n00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.395\nmaking you wonder what exactly\ncould be happening over there.\n\n502\n00:29:18.395 --> 00:29:23.325\nEven if we went farther down into\nthe computer we'll find bits and bytes.\n\n503\n00:29:23.325 --> 00:29:26.765\nAnd then even way farther down\nwe'll just find electric signals.\n\n504\n00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:30.685\nSo there's always that journey\nall the way to the fine details.\n\n505\n00:29:30.685 --> 00:29:33.665\nNow once we've created this query\nwhat could we possibly do with it?\n\n506\n00:29:33.665 --> 00:29:35.515\nWe can now create a report and\n\n507\n00:29:35.515 --> 00:29:39.500\nsay, I just want a report of\nthe orders made by individuals.\n\n508\n00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.830\nSo I can go back to my report section and\nsay I want to create using a wizard.\n\n509\n00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.875\nAnd say, I want to go not to the table but\nto the query.\n\n510\n00:29:48.875 --> 00:29:52.350\nI click query and\nthen I want to take all the fields.\n\n511\n00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:56.714\nAnd now this time around, I just run\nacross, run across, run across and finish.\n\n512\n00:29:56.714 --> 00:29:59.010\nBoom, now there we go,\n\n513\n00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.770\nit's the same information that\nwas available in that query.\n\n514\n00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.010\nNow it has created a report.\n\n515\n00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.350\nNow we have two reports.\n\n516\n00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.090\nSo this report is picking\nfrom two different tables.\n\n517\n00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.590\nI really do hope that\nit's given you a glimpse.\n\n518\n00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:13.850\nIt's a glimpse, because we can\ncreate very complicated reports,\n\n519\n00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.141\nvery complicated queries.\n\n520\n00:30:15.141 --> 00:30:19.190\nBut I have given you a glimpse where we\ncan extract data from different tables.\n\n521\n00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.528\nUse some query instructions\nthat we can reuse, so\n\n522\n00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:23.150\nyou can create very many queries.\n\n523\n00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:24.640\nYeah, you don't have to reuse this.\n\n524\n00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.480\nIf you use this for\n\n525\n00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.820\nevery time you want to create a new one,\nyou can create a query out of queries.\n\n526\n00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.190\nYou can put labels and labels and\nmake it really complicated and\n\n527\n00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.980\nget very useful information out of\nthe original data that you have.\n\n528\n00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.457\nI really do hope that this is a powerful\ntool that you will learn, and\n\n529\n00:30:40.457 --> 00:30:44.007\nmy great friend here, query,\nI mean my great friend here, Ronnie.\n\n530\n00:30:44.007 --> 00:30:47.902\n[LAUGH] Now I've talked about query so\nmuch that I want to call him a query.\n\n531\n00:30:47.902 --> 00:30:50.866\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And he walks through the queries a lot,\n\n532\n00:30:50.866 --> 00:30:53.630\nand I'm sure he has something to say.\n\n533\n00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.730\n>> When we start taking a look\nat the idea of queries,\n\n534\n00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.360\nthe simple idea is that somebody's\ngonna need the information out of it.\n\n535\n00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.850\nAnd you need to be able to\nactually pull that information and\n\n536\n00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.260\nalso the related\ninformation that's needed.\n\n537\n00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.795\nIf the data exists in multiple tables the\nway for you to get that information out is\n\n538\n00:31:09.795 --> 00:31:15.310\ngonna either doing individual queries\non every single little table.\n\n539\n00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:19.850\nOr creating a larger query that\nallows you to actually query multiple\n\n540\n00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.350\ntables together and\nactually do a single query and doing that.\n\n541\n00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.960\nWell that does get a little\nbit more complicated.\n\n542\n00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.520\nBut the great thing is, you're not\nhere at this point in learning about\n\n543\n00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.590\nMicrosoft Access to be able to\nunderstand how to do it programatically.\n\n544\n00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.500\nWhat you're actually here\nto do is to be able to say,\n\n545\n00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.160\nI know that there's a tool to help me out.\n\n546\n00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.910\nAnd just like what Dr.\nOmwansa showed us here.\n\n547\n00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:48.270\nIs that when we start to run the query and\nif we do go ahead and\n\n548\n00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:52.170\ndecide to create our own query in\nthe design view or using the wizard.\n\n549\n00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.420\nIt tells us what we need to pick out.\n\n550\n00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.609\nWhat tables do I need?\n\n551\n00:31:55.609 --> 00:32:00.138\nWhat particular field do I need\nto pull the information from?\n\n552\n00:32:00.138 --> 00:32:02.384\nAnd even gives us a chance to filter it.\n\n553\n00:32:02.384 --> 00:32:07.767\nI may find out I do not want any Any of\nthe information after a particular date.\n\n554\n00:32:07.767 --> 00:32:12.266\nWell, I can actually tell it I only want\nthe information before this date and\n\n555\n00:32:12.266 --> 00:32:16.140\nit only limits me to that and\ngives me exactly what I want.\n\n556\n00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.420\nAnd so\nthe way that you do that is using a query.\n\n557\n00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.910\nNow if you only have three or\nfour records, you may say it's easier for\n\n558\n00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.930\nme just to go and find them in\neach of the individual tables.\n\n559\n00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.360\nBut data is never static.\n\n560\n00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.100\nThat means that data will continue to\ngrow, and what you might find out one day\n\n561\n00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.630\nis that even though you were able to do\nthis successfully with 30 or 40 records,\n\n562\n00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:42.080\ntomorrow, the next week, next year,\nyou now have 5,000 records.\n\n563\n00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.870\nYou now have 10,000 records.\n\n564\n00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.000\nYou now have 50,000 records.\n\n565\n00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.480\nWell, now it becomes a bit\nmore challenging for\n\n566\n00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.340\nyou to do that individually,\none at a time.\n\n567\n00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:56.740\nA query though, can take that and go into\nthe relational database management system\n\n568\n00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.132\nand actually pull that query up and\nmaybe in a matter of minutes,\n\n569\n00:33:00.132 --> 00:33:03.090\nbe able to give you all the results\nthat you're looking for, so\n\n570\n00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:06.720\nit's a very powerful thing that you\ncan have here with the queries.\n\n571\n00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.580\nAnd Dr. Amanza showed us one more\nthing that was actually great and\n\n572\n00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:13.500\nthis is the way that I actually create\nreports too, is to go ahead and\n\n573\n00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.510\ncreate the query, verify that that's the\ninformation I definitely need to see and\n\n574\n00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.140\nthen I go and\ncreate my report based on the query.\n\n575\n00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.260\nAnd that way I'm not looking for\nor when I'm creating the report I\n\n576\n00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.190\nalready know that all the information that\nI need to see is based on that query and\n\n577\n00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.750\nnow the report that I\nwant to give to somebody\n\n578\n00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.810\nis all based right there\noff that one single query.\n\n579\n00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.740\nAnd I didn't have to learn\nanything about that SQL language.\n\n580\n00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.920\nI simply needed to verify that I\npicked all the right fields, and\n\n581\n00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.350\nthat's how powerful\nMicrosoft Access 2010 is.\n\n582\n00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.230\nIt is a great utility and a great tool for\n\n583\n00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:52.060\nthose of you that are actually going on\nto do more about working with databases.\n\n584\n00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.125\nIt's a great place to begin,\nthis is exactly where I began.\n\n585\n00:33:55.125 --> 00:33:58.960\nIt was actually way back in different\nversions of Access, Access 97,\n\n586\n00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.990\nbut overall though, it kind of still works\nthe same even though the interface has\n\n587\n00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:07.340\nchanged over time but the skills\nare transferable and that's why you still\n\n588\n00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.110\nseeing it used today even though\nits been around for a long time.\n\n589\n00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:15.219\nSo Dr. Amanza, any last parting\nwords of advice on Access?\n\n590\n00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.350\n>> My parting shot is that\nyou can get better with time,\n\n591\n00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.120\nif you're interested in\nlearning more about this.\n\n592\n00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.930\nDatabases are important, whether or not\nyou're gonna be the one working with them.\n\n593\n00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:30.605\nBut you need to understand\nthe principle behind the database.\n\n594\n00:34:30.605 --> 00:34:34.115\nBecause we manipulate data,\nwe need to make decisions and\n\n595\n00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:36.095\ndecisions are based on data.\n\n596\n00:34:36.095 --> 00:34:40.425\nAnd we can rely on other people to build\nthese databases, but it is important for\n\n597\n00:34:40.425 --> 00:34:45.140\nus to appreciate the foundation and\nthe concept around the database.\n\n598\n00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:49.500\nAs you build your competence on\nthe database, you can become very useful.\n\n599\n00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.550\nThere are people who create\nspecializations in database and, you know,\n\n600\n00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.350\nthey provide that kind of a service.\n\n601\n00:34:55.350 --> 00:35:01.570\nThey can create very complex queries, very\ncomplex inner reports, very interesting\n\n602\n00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:06.190\nforms, and they solve a lot of problems\nyou know, by clicking a button you have so\n\n603\n00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:09.840\nmuch information, you can pull\ndifferent kind of things together.\n\n604\n00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.530\nThis is an important resource.\n\n605\n00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.220\nIt is a very, very important resource.\n\n606\n00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.750\nSo now this has brought us to a close,\nbecause we can't spend all the time here.\n\n607\n00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.550\nWe only have so much time.\n\n608\n00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:25.100\nWe hope that we've given\na glimpse about databases and\n\n609\n00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.500\nyou're gonna spend your own time\ntrying to practice, understand.\n\n610\n00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.925\nThere are more things that are in there\nthat we didn't get to talk about.\n\n611\n00:35:32.925 --> 00:35:36.460\nYou can flip between,\nyou have literature that you can read,\n\n612\n00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.540\nthere's some material available free\nonline that you can study about databases,\n\n613\n00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:44.390\nyou appreciate the concepts even more and\nthen you try to practice\n\n614\n00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:49.000\nusing the tools that are available,\nin this case Microsoft Access 2010.\n\n615\n00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.410\nSo for me I think it's been great,\nit's been real, I don't know about Ronnie.\n\n616\n00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:57.510\n>> It has been a fun time\ngetting to review the idea and\n\n617\n00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.570\nconcepts here in Microsoft Access 2010.\n\n618\n00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.150\nSo do take everything in mind here.\n\n619\n00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.400\nIf you're actually working\nwith databases and\n\n620\n00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.070\nyou're having to actually learn it, this\nis a great fundamental place to begin.\n\n621\n00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.820\nBut remember that just about everything\nyou see that has some type of information\n\n622\n00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.580\non it that you've asked for has probably\nbeen run from a database as well,\n\n623\n00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.510\nand that helps make that connection\nthe way that we want to.\n\n624\n00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.500\nBut it's a great place for\nus to also end this episode, then.\n\n625\n00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.070\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n626\n00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.925\n>> And my name is Dr.\n\n627\n00:36:26.925 --> 00:36:30.330\nTony Amanza, enjoying learning\ntogether about databases.\n\n628\n00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:35.319\n>> All right, stay tuned right here for\nmore computing fundamentals.\n\n629\n00:36:35.319 --> 00:36:43.500\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.256\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and you're\nwatching the Computing Fundamentals IC3.\n\n4\n00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:22.908\nNow we're about to get into,\nwell, Microsoft PowerPoint.\n\n5\n00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:25.680\nWe've been taking a look at the Office\nsuite, and we've covered some\n\n6\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.066\nof the different products, and we're now\nmoving in to the realm of PowerPoint here.\n\n7\n00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.825\nAnd who better to help us out than Dr.\nTonny Omwansa.\n\n8\n00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:35.149\nDr. Omwansa, welcome back to our studios.\n\n9\n00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.020\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n10\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.060\nI'm enjoying myself here.\n\n11\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.575\nWe are now, we want to immerse ourself\nto another level thinking about\n\n12\n00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:44.200\nhow do we present that\nwhich we have built?\n\n13\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.990\nWe've used Excel, we've used Microsoft\nWord, we have, tables here and there,\n\n14\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.960\nnow we're gonna make a presentation to\nsomebody and how do we organize ourselves?\n\n15\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.960\nThat's the power of PowerPoint.\n\n16\n00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.941\n>> So when we start seeing the idea of\nusing PowerPoint, we have to understand\n\n17\n00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:02.858\nthat the whole idea behind this, right,\nis to create a presentation that\n\n18\n00:01:02.858 --> 00:01:06.987\nwe are going to, well, probably present\nto an audience that we have on hand.\n\n19\n00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:09.442\nAnd the idea here is not\nsimply as to speaking, but\n\n20\n00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:13.534\nbeing able to make our point not only with\nwords, but also graphically as well, and\n\n21\n00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:16.310\nPowerPoint is one of those\ntools to help us out.\n\n22\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.688\nSo where are we gonna being with\nthis particular tool, Dr. Omwasa?\n\n23\n00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:22.150\n>> All right.\n\n24\n00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.390\nWe're gonna spend some time\nthinking about a number of things\n\n25\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.610\nin the context of PowerPoint.\n\n26\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.483\nOne is that I want us to understand\nthe basic PowerPoint presentation.\n\n27\n00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:34.520\nLet's understand how it's organized.\n\n28\n00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.200\nWhat is the format of the presentation?\n\n29\n00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.220\nHow does should the format\npresentation get to look like?\n\n30\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.460\nWe'll think about,\nhow do we create different slides,\n\n31\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.930\ndifferent types of slides so\nthat when we put it all together,\n\n32\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.260\nit's interesting to watch and\nalso used to present.\n\n33\n00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.550\nWe'll also try to apply\na bit of transitions.\n\n34\n00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.500\nWhen you move normally from one slide\nto another, there's a transition,\n\n35\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.040\nso when text moves or when images move,\nthey are transitioned.\n\n36\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.594\nHow do we organize those transitions and\ncreate some animation effect so\n\n37\n00:02:05.594 --> 00:02:07.875\nthat it is interesting\nto see how things move?\n\n38\n00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:12.735\nAnd finally, we'll try to create a simple\npresentation that you could easily see on\n\n39\n00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:17.160\na computer as though you are actually\neven watching a television.\n\n40\n00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.430\nThat's basically the outline\nof what we will cover.\n\n41\n00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.970\nAnd so,\nI'll quickly move into getting started.\n\n42\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.360\nSo on my computer,\nI've basically opened a PowerPoint page.\n\n43\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.710\nSo there we go.\n\n44\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.470\nSo I have a PowerPoint page,\n\n45\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.360\nwhich is typically the first page you\nwould get whenever you open PowerPoint.\n\n46\n00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.220\nAnd as you can tell, right up here,\nthe layout is similar to what we\n\n47\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.580\nwere going through when we were dealing\nwith, Excel and Microsoft Word.\n\n48\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.879\nOf course, there are new things,\nas you can see, for example,\n\n49\n00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.143\nthere are transitions\nwhich were not there, but\n\n50\n00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:01.377\nwhen you think about Review,\nView, Design, Insert, Home.\n\n51\n00:03:01.377 --> 00:03:07.120\nThe layout is generic, and at the bottom\nhere, of course, we have the status bar.\n\n52\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.480\nIt's the same, all right?\n\n53\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.080\nSo this is the same experience\nas we've had before.\n\n54\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.600\nNow every time you start\nthis PowerPoint slide,\n\n55\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.090\nyou have this space that gives you\nan opportunity to do a number of things.\n\n56\n00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.230\nOn the extreme left, so\n\n57\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.840\nif I open this it will give you\nan idea of how that layout looks like.\n\n58\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.590\nAll right, so this is some,\nalready some slides have been put here.\n\n59\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.814\nAnd you can see over here there is a set\nof slides, so a presentation can have\n\n60\n00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:41.420\n1 slide, 2 slides, 100 slides,\nall depends on what you're doing.\n\n61\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.893\nSo you'll see a set of\nslides on your left,\n\n62\n00:03:43.893 --> 00:03:47.328\nand now this is the slide that\nyou may be working on, so it's\n\n63\n00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:52.233\ncalled a slide pin where you focus on that\nparticular slide that you're working on.\n\n64\n00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:56.465\nAnd then down here there is a set of\nnotes that you can actually put for\n\n65\n00:03:56.465 --> 00:03:58.030\na particular slide.\n\n66\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.447\nIt can remind you later what were you\nworking on on that particular slide.\n\n67\n00:04:01.447 --> 00:04:04.270\nAnd then at the bottom of the status bar,\n\n68\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.872\nthere's an opportunity to play around\nwith how you want to view the slides.\n\n69\n00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:12.630\nYou may want to see all the slides in one\ngo, or you want to see one at a time, or\n\n70\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.610\nyou want to see a slide show,\nor whatever that may be.\n\n71\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.677\nSo that's the layout,\n\n72\n00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:20.830\nnow just to show you how could I add\na slide here, there are two ways.\n\n73\n00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.309\nI can come here and\nright click and insert a slide.\n\n74\n00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:27.460\nSo automatically we have two\nslides in my presentation.\n\n75\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.440\nOr I can simply go up here, New Slide,\nand now I have three slides.\n\n76\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.320\nAnd then you look,\nthe first slide has a slightly different\n\n77\n00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.750\ndesign from the second one, in terms\nof the template that has been created.\n\n78\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.670\nSo right here, it's assuming that you're\ngoing to start with some kind of a title.\n\n79\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.830\nAnd then,\nthere will be some kind of a subtitle.\n\n80\n00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.360\nSo that's a generic design, you don't\nhave to use that, you can always modify.\n\n81\n00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.810\nAnd then the second and third slide,\nthey have a similar design.\n\n82\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.900\nIt's assumed that somewhere here\nyou're gonna put in a title.\n\n83\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.910\nAnd probably you're going to\nput some text here, all right?\n\n84\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.670\nAnd then as you can see, also there is\nsome buttons put right at the center here,\n\n85\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.600\nsome kind of images.\n\n86\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.440\nIt tells you that you can\ninsert something like an image,\n\n87\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.265\nyou can insert a chart,\nyou can insert a graph,\n\n88\n00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:22.345\nyou can insert a video actually, you can\ninsert an image, or whatever it may be.\n\n89\n00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:23.925\nSo this is a general layout,\n\n90\n00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:28.750\nthis is what you kind of expect when you\nopen up a Microsoft PowerPoint image.\n\n91\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.630\nI really want to believe that it's\nnothing too new, it's similar, and\n\n92\n00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.548\nmaybe you may have some thoughts\nalong the same thinking.\n\n93\n00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:39.590\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt if one of\nthe tools you actually use to make\n\n94\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.650\nthe point that you need,\n\n95\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.340\nthe most intuitive one in the Office Suite\nis going to be PowerPoint presentation.\n\n96\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.752\nAs you take a look at it, unlike Word,\nright, when it normally opens up,\n\n97\n00:05:48.752 --> 00:05:50.954\nit gives us a document\nthat we are looking at, or\n\n98\n00:05:50.954 --> 00:05:53.440\nit may offer us the ability\nto do a template.\n\n99\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.480\nAnd Excel normally opens up to maybe\nthat worksheet that we have, and\n\n100\n00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.370\nreally doesn't guide us\nin what we want to do.\n\n101\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.190\nBut by default, when PowerPoint opens up,\nit automatically gives you,\n\n102\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.800\nI don't wanna say it's a command.\n\n103\n00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.910\nBut it says,\nthis is where you type information in.\n\n104\n00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.960\nSo it's already telling you what to\ndo at the very beginning when you\n\n105\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.620\nfirst open it up.\n\n106\n00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.160\nAnd the goal here, right,\n\n107\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.020\nis for you to understand that this is\nnot a difficult tool for us to use.\n\n108\n00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.780\nBut it does require us to think\na little bit more in the idea of\n\n109\n00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.030\nwhat points do I really need to make when\nI'm actually making my presentation?\n\n110\n00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.030\nAnd the layout that we saw right there\nallows us to be able to see, well,\n\n111\n00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.100\nnot only the number of slides that we\ncan create that we are gonna display.\n\n112\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.850\nBut also gives the presenter\nthe ability to add in\n\n113\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.735\nadditional notes that won't show\nup during the presentation.\n\n114\n00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:45.110\nBut will allow you to have them either\non the screen or printed out, and\n\n115\n00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.860\nthat way you can also use that along\nwith your presentation as well.\n\n116\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.920\nTo be able to have a guide for\nyou to follow, or even notes for\n\n117\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.952\nsomebody else to take as they're using\nthis particular type of demonstration.\n\n118\n00:06:56.952 --> 00:07:01.330\nNow, PowerPoint is one of those tools that\nyou'd normally see inside of, well, a lot\n\n119\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.520\nof times, right, at the idea of a school\nor a university level, where somebody's\n\n120\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.980\nactually lecturing a lot of times, and\nit takes a little bit of time to create.\n\n121\n00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.170\nBut because it's so intuitive,\n\n122\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.000\nmost people can pick this\nparticular skill up fairly easily.\n\n123\n00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.173\nThe views that Dr.\n\n124\n00:07:17.173 --> 00:07:21.510\nOmwansa was talking about also help you\nout in the more slides that you get.\n\n125\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.380\nYou can actually turn it to a view\nthat shows you every single slide.\n\n126\n00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.000\nAnd that allows you to lay it out like you\nwould lay out different index cards onto\n\n127\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.890\na table.\n\n128\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.960\nThen you can rearrange the orders, as if\nthey're actually laid out on a table,\n\n129\n00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.186\nthan you can put them in a proper\nlogical order that you want to.\n\n130\n00:07:37.186 --> 00:07:41.290\nThis tool itself, right, gives you a lot\nof function and doesn't take a lot for\n\n131\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.030\nyou to actually figure out how it works.\n\n132\n00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.337\nThere's not a lot of formulas\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n133\n00:07:45.337 --> 00:07:49.497\nThere's not even a lot of formatting,\nunless you choose to make it that way,\n\n134\n00:07:49.497 --> 00:07:53.273\nthat you have to do, because PowerPoint\nis designed for you to be up and\n\n135\n00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:57.251\ngetting ready to go, probably within 10 or\n15 minutes if you need to.\n\n136\n00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.151\nTo make the points that\nyou need to as well.\n\n137\n00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:02.222\nSo there is a lot of information\nright here that we've\n\n138\n00:08:02.222 --> 00:08:06.870\njust done really in the first five or\nten minutes of this bigger episode.\n\n139\n00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.770\nBecause once you learn those\nbasic skills a lot of this\n\n140\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.630\nat this point is really\nabout your creativity and\n\n141\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.300\nabout making sure you understand what\nyour point is that you want to make.\n\n142\n00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:21.444\n>> So we'll spend a few more\nminutes just to help our\n\n143\n00:08:21.444 --> 00:08:24.850\nself to get familiar\nwith that environment.\n\n144\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.390\nSome of the things that we can possibly\ndo, insert a slide, remove a slide.\n\n145\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.006\nChange the design of the layout for\nthat model.\n\n146\n00:08:33.006 --> 00:08:36.860\nSo that's what we're gonna do for the next\nfew minutes, and if you have your computer\n\n147\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.850\nthere of course you will be\nable to do it yourself as well.\n\n148\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.820\nSo, as you can see here there is a set of,\nslides that I introduced.\n\n149\n00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.570\nAnd like I said I can right click here and\nI can add a new slide.\n\n150\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.340\nI can scroll between slides and\n\n151\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.350\nget to see if I want to change the way\nthe layout of a particular slide looks.\n\n152\n00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.160\nBecause as you can see there is basically\na slight different layout here.\n\n153\n00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.940\nI can come here and\nunder the Home section,\n\n154\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.884\nthe tab of Home,\nI can pick under the section of slides.\n\n155\n00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:10.195\nI can see layout there and\n\n156\n00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:13.646\nI have several different types of\nlayouts that I could pick from.\n\n157\n00:09:13.646 --> 00:09:17.316\nSo I can pick, wow so\nthat's a picture with caption.\n\n158\n00:09:17.316 --> 00:09:19.880\nNow that is the layout simply changes.\n\n159\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.148\nI might be more interested in, well,\n\n160\n00:09:22.148 --> 00:09:25.500\nsuppose I actually had two\ncontents more like two columns.\n\n161\n00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.260\nSo I have a title and then two columns.\n\n162\n00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.580\nAnd as you can see if I click this for\nexample I can pick\n\n163\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.490\na picture that is in there real quick and\nI already have a picture.\n\n164\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.730\nMaybe I want to put some text here.\n\n165\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:46.010\nI can say okay, Text 1, Text 2,\nText 3 and things like that.\n\n166\n00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.250\nI have this design already and I can put\nmy title here, thanks for the intro.\n\n167\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.940\nAll right, so\nI already have some kind of a slide.\n\n168\n00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.120\nAnd then if I want this one to\nbe a slightly different layout,\n\n169\n00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.110\nI can change the layout.\n\n170\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.080\nWell, maybe I want this kind of\nlayout where there is only text.\n\n171\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.970\nOr I'm interested in the layout like\nthis where I can put my text here and\n\n172\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.340\nthen I can do something else here.\n\n173\n00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.170\nSo this is an opportunity to play around.\n\n174\n00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:15.990\nNow, but my slides are increasing as you\ncan tell I already have five, four or so.\n\n175\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.580\nI can have a slightly different view which\n\n176\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.320\ngives me an opportunity\nto see all of them.\n\n177\n00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.890\nRight below here at the status bar.\n\n178\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.300\nThat difference options.\n\n179\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.690\nThis is a normal one.\n\n180\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.710\nThese are slide sorter which enables me to\nshut slides, like I can see all of them.\n\n181\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.570\nAnd the reason it's called a slide sorter\nis because this is probably the best place\n\n182\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.920\nthat I can use to move slides back and\nforth and say which ones do I want.\n\n183\n00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.700\nWhich place do I want them.\n\n184\n00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.000\nSo I can possibly say, okay,\nthat was good for starting.\n\n185\n00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.890\nAnd then I can take these, click it, and\n\n186\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.530\nthen I can drag it to the left,\nand there I am.\n\n187\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.429\nSo it means I can sort the slides in\ndifferent ways, as I want them to look.\n\n188\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:02.320\nThen I can get a chance to add options\nin there if I want a slideshow.\n\n189\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.460\nLike I really want now to\ndisplay the whole presentation.\n\n190\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.020\nI can do like that and\nthen I can click and\n\n191\n00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.150\nthen the slides are moving\none after another.\n\n192\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.750\nIf I want to have a reading view so\n\n193\n00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.320\nthat I can look through everything, that's\nhow we'll do it, moving back and forth.\n\n194\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.390\nSo all this down here gives me\nan opportunity to have different views.\n\n195\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.420\nSo already right now,\nyou know how you can insert the slide.\n\n196\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.160\nYou can delete a slide, so\nif I can click on this slide, and\n\n197\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.420\njust press the delete button,\nthe slide will be gone.\n\n198\n00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.520\nI can undo that, Ctrl + Z,\nand the slide is back.\n\n199\n00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.320\nIf I want to move, I can also move this\nslide, I can click it and drag it up,\n\n200\n00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.400\nand then it becomes slide number two.\n\n201\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.980\nSo already now I have a sense of\nhow I could move things around.\n\n202\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:53.011\nAnd I can copy slide and\npaste it, so I can Crtl+C.\n\n203\n00:11:53.011 --> 00:11:56.770\nAnd then I can decide what do I want\nto down put it on slide number two.\n\n204\n00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.010\nI can click right there in the middle\nof the slide number one and\n\n205\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.160\ntwo and I can click paste now\nI have a new slide there.\n\n206\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.760\nSo it's really easy\nexperience is very nice.\n\n207\n00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.390\nAnd the outcome, you get results very\nquickly, without spending a lot of effort.\n\n208\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.810\nSo I hope it gives you a sense\nthat this is an easy tool to use.\n\n209\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:18.400\nRight?\n\n210\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.180\n>> It really is.\n\n211\n00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.442\nEverybody has, of course a different way\nof being able to create a presentation.\n\n212\n00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:25.587\nAnd one of the methods for us, right away,\n\n213\n00:12:25.587 --> 00:12:28.156\nis not to worry about how\nthe way everything looks.\n\n214\n00:12:28.156 --> 00:12:32.898\nBut to simply get the information that\nyou want to present onto those slides.\n\n215\n00:12:32.898 --> 00:12:37.025\nAt that point we can use some of the\nthings that we've already learned about\n\n216\n00:12:37.025 --> 00:12:39.983\nfrom the other tools that\nwe've been talking about.\n\n217\n00:12:39.983 --> 00:12:45.837\nEspecially word and excel,\nsuch as the copy, cut and paste.\n\n218\n00:12:45.837 --> 00:12:49.831\nTo help us out to move data\nbetween those particular tools and\n\n219\n00:12:49.831 --> 00:12:52.190\neven into PowerPoint if we need to.\n\n220\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.070\nAnd a lot of times once we get that\ninformation on there then we can work\n\n221\n00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.250\non formatting.\n\n222\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.270\nSo at this point when you start thinking\nabout, well how do I really begin\n\n223\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.880\nwell you need to of course then think\nabout it really on paper at the beginning.\n\n224\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.480\nBefore you start, figure out what\nit is that you want to display and\n\n225\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.510\nwhat points that you really want to make.\n\n226\n00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.800\nAnd then begin to make a slide for\neach one of them, and\n\n227\n00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.370\nthen you can use those\ndifferent slide layouts.\n\n228\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.230\nIf you know that it's gonna be\nreally about the text itself,\n\n229\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.990\nyou may choose that text layout.\n\n230\n00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.690\nOr if you do have images,\n\n231\n00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:28.470\nyou may choose to put one of those that\nactually has those little six icons on it.\n\n232\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:32.540\nAnd then select the one that tells you\nthat you can actually go ahead and\n\n233\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.998\ninsert in an image.\n\n234\n00:13:33.998 --> 00:13:37.800\nAnd then we'll go ahead and bring it\nto a place where you can search and\n\n235\n00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.630\nfind the image that you want to\npopulate that slide as well.\n\n236\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.713\nAnd of course the other elements that\nare actually involved there too.\n\n237\n00:13:44.713 --> 00:13:49.488\nAnd that way,\nonce you get all of that information\n\n238\n00:13:49.488 --> 00:13:54.842\ninside of that PowerPoint\npresentation that you want.\n\n239\n00:13:54.842 --> 00:13:59.010\nThen you can start worrying\nabout the idea of formatting.\n\n240\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.150\nA lot of times you might think about\nformatting as you go along the way but\n\n241\n00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.870\nyou're slowing yourself down.\n\n242\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.110\nInstead, what you wanna do is actually\nsay, here's all the information I want.\n\n243\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.030\nAnd then,\nI'll worry about formatting later.\n\n244\n00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.550\nAnd that's what we're about\nto get into as well, right?\n\n245\n00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:16.390\n>> Yeah, so, now we will begin\nto think about how do we format.\n\n246\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:21.210\nAnd I think appreciating that\nthe value of thinking about what you\n\n247\n00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.710\nwant to see at the end is\nimportant before you begin.\n\n248\n00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.518\nThat's really, really important.\n\n249\n00:14:26.518 --> 00:14:29.650\nBecause you want to start\nwith the end in mind.\n\n250\n00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.860\nHow do you want to communicate at the end?\n\n251\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.290\nWhat information do you want\nto communicate at the end?\n\n252\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.150\nAnd then you start building yourself and\n\n253\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.260\nthinking about how would this\nparticular information look like?\n\n254\n00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.040\nIf it's an image,\nwhat do I want to say about that image?\n\n255\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.580\nDo I want to put more text?\n\n256\n00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.355\nOr less text.\n\n257\n00:14:47.355 --> 00:14:49.770\nBut there's certainly\nprinciples we're going to use.\n\n258\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:54.800\nSo right now I want us to talk\nabout the theme, thinking about\n\n259\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.460\nthe presentation theme and how the layer\nchannel is going to look like.\n\n260\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.730\nBefore we send out our presentation.\n\n261\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:07.910\nSo once you have the content and you have\na sense of what you want to communicate\n\n262\n00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.770\nyou want to think about the theme.\n\n263\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.820\nAnd we spoke about themes earlier on.\n\n264\n00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:17.210\nAnd in other episodes and\nthemes are important because\n\n265\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:22.970\nsome people already spent time thinking\nabout matching colors here and there.\n\n266\n00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.390\nThinking about how things\ncould possibly flow,\n\n267\n00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.910\nwhat kind of backgrounds are appropriate\nfor certain kinds of presentations.\n\n268\n00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.104\nAnd if you start with\na certain kind of background,\n\n269\n00:15:35.104 --> 00:15:37.300\nwhich one could you\npossibly consider next?\n\n270\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.270\nAnd things like that.\n\n271\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.583\nAnd that's why there is\na concept of Design.\n\n272\n00:15:43.583 --> 00:15:47.533\nSo, if you click the tab, Design,\n\n273\n00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:52.157\nyou'll start seeing options of things.\n\n274\n00:15:52.157 --> 00:15:53.870\nThe first is the most basic.\n\n275\n00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.528\nAnd if you actually click any of them or\n\n276\n00:15:56.528 --> 00:16:02.390\neven scroll right across you'll start\nseeing the presentation changing.\n\n277\n00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.380\nSo right now let's assume that\nthere was no content really,\n\n278\n00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.800\nafter all we haven't put any much.\n\n279\n00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.739\nSo if I scroll across you\nsee wow that's the angles,\n\n280\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.220\ndesign, it's really look interesting.\n\n281\n00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.350\nIt means the title is gonna be slanting.\n\n282\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.589\nThey see the apex, they see a.\n\n283\n00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:25.597\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:16:25.597 --> 00:16:27.382\n>> Apothecary, right?\n\n285\n00:16:27.382 --> 00:16:33.420\n>> There you go, this aspect,\nthis Austin, and on, and on, and on.\n\n286\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.900\nDifferent interesting presentation themes,\nand\n\n287\n00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.300\nif you click this right arrow\nhere you get even more options.\n\n288\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.570\nSo, let's just say hypothetically that,\n\n289\n00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:47.440\nwell maybe I'm interested in a particular\ntheme and there I go, I picked it.\n\n290\n00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.610\nAll right, so now, let's look at what\nthe other slides get to look like.\n\n291\n00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.400\nHo, well you see it's already\nkind of a theme has been created,\n\n292\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.570\na layout has been created up front.\n\n293\n00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.240\nYou know like things are already\nlooking very interesting, so\n\n294\n00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.250\nI can build from here.\n\n295\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.800\nI'm not under obligation\nto take exactly you know,\n\n296\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.360\nlike I'm going to take\neverything as it is here, but\n\n297\n00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.720\nI can just remove some things\nif I don't think I like them.\n\n298\n00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.530\nBut at least the theme has given\nme a good starting point, so\n\n299\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.610\nthat I can build on from here,\nadding more slides that are similar,\n\n300\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:21.080\nadding content, and then progressing.\n\n301\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.030\nSo I hope that through this\n\n302\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:30.060\ndesigns you'll find it valuable to\nbuild your presentations from here.\n\n303\n00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:35.710\nSo next we will be talking about a slide\nmaster, because after you've created,\n\n304\n00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:41.320\nyou've thought about your theme you wanna\nthink about categories of slides and\n\n305\n00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.670\nhow they are going to look like.\n\n306\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.110\nFor example, the first slide\ncan take a particular design.\n\n307\n00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.700\nThe second category could be\nslides that have bullet points.\n\n308\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.420\nHow do you want them to look like?\n\n309\n00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.950\nSlides that have images.\n\n310\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.190\nHow do you want them to look like?\n\n311\n00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.990\nSo that will be our next thought.\n\n312\n00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.930\nBut I think we can interact right now\n\n313\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:07.010\non the experiences of using these\nkind of themes and designs.\n\n314\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.980\n>> When we start thinking about\nusing the idea of themes,\n\n315\n00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.230\nit really helps us to be consistent\nin what we actually want to present.\n\n316\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.710\nIt's very easy to get stuck\non one slide and say,\n\n317\n00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.830\nI'm gonna design it\nthe way that I want to.\n\n318\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.340\nAnd then you move on to the second slide,\n\n319\n00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.370\nand you might have actually had your\ntaste changed, even in between that.\n\n320\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.020\nAnd now all of a sudden,\n\n321\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.200\nyour second slide looks a little\nbit different from your first one.\n\n322\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.020\nThird one begins actually be almost\nan order of magnitude and difference.\n\n323\n00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.040\nAnd then all of a sudden, when you try and\ndo your presentation, it really\n\n324\n00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.810\nlooks disjointed, as if you actually\nworked on this particular project well,\n\n325\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.220\nthroughout a long period of time, and\neven at different points in your life\n\n326\n00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.380\nwhere you didn't like certain things,\nand you liked other things.\n\n327\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.480\nWell the idea of a theme allows\nus to apply a consistent pattern\n\n328\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.010\nthroughout that shows that you took time\n\n329\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:57.520\nto think about the overall composition of\nevery single slide that you actually have.\n\n330\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.200\nSometimes you might be very creative,\nand if you are, there is, again,\n\n331\n00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.040\neven more advanced things you\ncan do inside of PowerPoint.\n\n332\n00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.070\nAnd even inside of Word, and even in\nExcel, which is to create your own theme.\n\n333\n00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.240\nBut at this point,\nusing the ones that are available\n\n334\n00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.600\nreally help you in productivity\nmore than anything else.\n\n335\n00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.170\nIt could be that your company says if\nyou're gonna create a PowerPoint slide,\n\n336\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.930\nhere is the theme you're going to use.\n\n337\n00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.850\nWell, that makes it easy for you.\n\n338\n00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.980\nBut if they just tell you that you\nneed to actually apply a theme to it\n\n339\n00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.980\nto just make it stand out a little bit.\n\n340\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.920\nWell, you have your choice.\n\n341\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.370\nBut instead of you having to\npick out every single element.\n\n342\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.980\nThese themes allow you to actually\ngo ahead and select ones.\n\n343\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.010\nThat you know that it's going\nto actually be consistent.\n\n344\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.300\nIt's going to be thematic throughout\nevery single slide that you have.\n\n345\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.320\nAnd it's gonna make a more\neffective overall presentation\n\n346\n00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.220\nthan looking like three, or four, or\n\n347\n00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.980\nten disjointed slides that you just packed\ntogether and decided to display and show.\n\n348\n00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.470\nAnd so all this element is actually very\nimportant because this is the one tool\n\n349\n00:19:54.470 --> 00:20:00.970\nthat we have where the emphasis is not\non so much on the content itself, right.\n\n350\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.840\nIn Excel you gotta worry about\nthe data that's in those cells.\n\n351\n00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.570\nIn Word you have to worry about the idea,\nof well ideas,\n\n352\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.800\nwhere you are writing out information or\nyou're typing out information.\n\n353\n00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.710\nBut in PowerPoint it's all\nabout the presentation, and so\n\n354\n00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.000\nwhen you don't think\nthat the element matters,\n\n355\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.790\nwell here in PowerPoint they're saying the\ngraphic element is one of the things that\n\n356\n00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:27.980\nmatters that helps to convey the overall\nidea that you want to convey.\n\n357\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.490\nSo you do need to take time in learning\nhow this actually works because it's gonna\n\n358\n00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:36.880\nbe one of the things that really helps us\nout in the future, and not every person\n\n359\n00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.430\nthat you actually end up working with is\nalways gonna be the person that can make\n\n360\n00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:46.150\na presentation, but you need to be one of\nthose people that can when asked to do so.\n\n361\n00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.820\nPowerPoint can help you to do that and\nshow you how to make it look good, and\n\n362\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.510\nactually allow you to even practice while\nyou're doing it, because you can then see\n\n363\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.860\nyourself as saying if I could click on\nthis slide, what would I say about it?\n\n364\n00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.520\nAs I move through my presentation,\nwhat point do I want to make?\n\n365\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.270\nIt really helps you to\norder your mind a bit more\n\n366\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:07.000\nthan you really think by just doing\na simple PowerPoint presentation.\n\n367\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.620\nBut it does take time and\nyou orienting yourself.\n\n368\n00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:14.260\nTo using it, and then figuring out what\nis visually appealing to your audience.\n\n369\n00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.640\nSo using themes is one of\nthe ways you begin to do that.\n\n370\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.190\n>> Great, so we've learned a little\nbit about themes, and style,\n\n371\n00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.280\nand we can take existing ones.\n\n372\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.240\nAnd if you want to make some changes, so\n\n373\n00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.580\nthat every time you create a new slide,\nyour changes can be effected,\n\n374\n00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.280\nthen you want to know a little\nbit about the slide master.\n\n375\n00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.910\nWhich gives you an opportunity\nto define some changes for\n\n376\n00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.600\nthe general layout, the general\nframework because you inherited,\n\n377\n00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.080\nyou captured a designed\nthat had already existed.\n\n378\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.450\nSo if you want to have some changes\nmaybe on the font or whatever.\n\n379\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.800\nSo that every time you create a new\nslide there's a slight change or\n\n380\n00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:03.430\nlike we spoke about footnotes, or it was\nheaders and footing in Microsoft Word,\n\n381\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.120\nwhere you have some generic things or\ntemplates that have been and they will\n\n382\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.250\nreflect on every new slide that you create\non, every new page that you create.\n\n383\n00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.480\nThen here is the opportunity for\nyou to do with the slide master.\n\n384\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:20.090\nSo if you go to the View section and then\nyou have this slide master over there.\n\n385\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.230\nNow in as much as we\nalready had several slides,\n\n386\n00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.800\nall I was thinking was about five or\nso, now we only have four.\n\n387\n00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.600\nSo what basically has happened is\nthat Microsoft PowerPoint has kind of\n\n388\n00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.890\npicked out the key things and\ndefine for you the key for\n\n389\n00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:41.070\ndesigns that you'll have, and\nthe layout basically how it's going to be.\n\n390\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.300\nSo if you want to make ma change at this\npoint in time you can make a change, and\n\n391\n00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.360\nthat now becomes now the new framework\nthat you can use for creating new slides.\n\n392\n00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.740\nYou can put in our logo over there and\n\n393\n00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.220\nsay now that logo is going\nto appear on every slide.\n\n394\n00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.970\nI don't have to keep copying my logo and\nputting it on every slide.\n\n395\n00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.430\nAnd that becomes a template that\nyou can even give other people and\n\n396\n00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.910\nsay that's the design that\nI want you people to use.\n\n397\n00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.430\nAnd I am the only one who\ncan make that change,\n\n398\n00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.960\nhowever you must consult with\nme if you want to make a change.\n\n399\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.440\nAnd that's for purposes of standardizing\nand customizing for yourself.\n\n400\n00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.730\n>> I think that that's really the key\nhere is the idea of standardization\n\n401\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.290\nacross my slides.\n\n402\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.650\nIt's very easy for\nyou to create a single slide and\n\n403\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.870\nthen go let me change this particular font\nto whatever font you may want to change.\n\n404\n00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.640\nSo by default,\nlet's say it's the Calibri font.\n\n405\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.520\nBut you may say I want all of my slides\nto be Arial Black if that's what you\n\n406\n00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.700\nchoose to do.\n\n407\n00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.780\nThat's perfectly fine,\n\n408\n00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.460\nonce you actually create one,\nyou can move on to second slide and\n\n409\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.020\nyou'll see it will default back to Calibri\nand then you have to change it again.\n\n410\n00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.458\nWell if you can go into the slide master,\n\n411\n00:23:43.458 --> 00:23:47.281\ninstead what you can do is you can\nchange it on the slide master.\n\n412\n00:23:47.281 --> 00:23:52.238\nOnce you change it on the slide master and\nevery new slide that you create\n\n413\n00:23:52.238 --> 00:23:55.625\nit automatically default\nto that Arial Black and\n\n414\n00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:59.769\nthat way you don't have to\nworry about making that change.\n\n415\n00:23:59.769 --> 00:24:01.329\nOn the slide master that Dr.\n\n416\n00:24:01.329 --> 00:24:05.110\nOmwansa showed us, you actually\nsaw something like a layout right?\n\n417\n00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.210\nOr an outline format and\nwhat you saw where it was left and\n\n418\n00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.950\nit was indented and\nyou saw those different indents.\n\n419\n00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.610\nWell some of them had\nbullet points to them,\n\n420\n00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:18.080\nwhat if you didn't like the default bullet\npoint and you wanted to change it instead?\n\n421\n00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.640\nWell remember that you can change it for\nevery slide, but\n\n422\n00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.070\nthen the next slide it goes back\nautomatically to the default.\n\n423\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.850\nChanging it on the slide master,\nallows you to keep it consistent.\n\n424\n00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.180\nSo when you do choose to\ncreate some type of outline.\n\n425\n00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.900\nYou instead can say, here is\nthe bullet point that I wanted to make\n\n426\n00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.030\ninstead of the default, and having\nto change it for every single slide.\n\n427\n00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.680\nThe slide masters are very important.\n\n428\n00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.973\nEspecially if you create a lot\nof these presentations and\n\n429\n00:24:43.973 --> 00:24:48.030\nyou want the same consistency\nthroughout it or the standardization.\n\n430\n00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.842\nWhether it's in your entire organization\nor just even for things that you want,\n\n431\n00:24:52.842 --> 00:24:56.150\nusing the slide master is\nwhat helps us to do that.\n\n432\n00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.680\nAnd so\nit may be where you're actually told that,\n\n433\n00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:04.030\nhere's the actual slide master that you're\ngonna end up using inside a PowerPoint.\n\n434\n00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.460\nAnd that will default to what ever\nyour company says is gonna happen, and\n\n435\n00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.000\nthat's how you have to produce it.\n\n436\n00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.030\nBut you do have that option\nto go in there and change it.\n\n437\n00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.460\nIt's actually running\nonly on your computer.\n\n438\n00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.291\nBut if somebody else has created\nthat PowerPoint, like what Dr.\n\n439\n00:25:17.291 --> 00:25:21.500\nOmwansa said, they're the ones that really\nhave ultimate control of that slide master\n\n440\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.430\nespecially if you lock that document\ndown where nobody else can do it.\n\n441\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.270\nWell then he can actually do that.\n\n442\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.090\nBut it's one of these important things\nthat really can help you out in\n\n443\n00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.400\nterms of time.\n\n444\n00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.930\nIf not you may find yourself\nafter 40 slides here, and\n\n445\n00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.420\nrealize that you've been changing every\nlittle detail in the formatting on\n\n446\n00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.720\nevery single slide, when you could have\njust simply changed the slide master.\n\n447\n00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.620\nIt really is about productivity and\nsaving time.\n\n448\n00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.442\nAnd that's what the slide\nmaster can help us to do.\n\n449\n00:25:47.442 --> 00:25:48.976\n>> Awesome.\n\n450\n00:25:48.976 --> 00:25:51.780\nNow you know we now wanna think about,\n\n451\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.172\nokay I've got that foundation,\nI understand the layout.\n\n452\n00:25:56.172 --> 00:26:00.723\nI understand the principle,\nthe design and maybe I need to stop and\n\n453\n00:26:00.723 --> 00:26:05.760\ndoing some text here, you know\nsome content onto my presentation.\n\n454\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.570\nSo what I've basically done is that I've\ncreated a simple PowerPoint presentation\n\n455\n00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.720\nand I'll call it my first page here\nis introduction to PowerPoint.\n\n456\n00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.680\nI don't have the designs yet and I don't\nwant to spend my time on that one for now.\n\n457\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.303\nI want to demonstrate\nmaking some entries here.\n\n458\n00:26:21.303 --> 00:26:26.089\nSo on my second slide here if\nyou click right here I'm able to\n\n459\n00:26:26.089 --> 00:26:28.790\nput in a simple text foundation.\n\n460\n00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:33.370\nI can click anywhere here and say outline.\n\n461\n00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.080\nSo let's say let's call\nthis foundation outline.\n\n462\n00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.345\nAnd introduction and\n\n463\n00:26:41.345 --> 00:26:46.995\nthen tables, and images,\nand on, and on, and on.\n\n464\n00:26:46.995 --> 00:26:49.065\nSo I'm already typing.\n\n465\n00:26:49.065 --> 00:26:51.285\nThat section in which I was typing,\n\n466\n00:26:51.285 --> 00:26:56.715\nthere is some boundary here that helps\nme to know where exactly I'm typing.\n\n467\n00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:59.655\nAnd I can play around with these,\nI can move to the right, so\n\n468\n00:26:59.655 --> 00:27:01.690\nthat means it moves the entire text.\n\n469\n00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.940\nI can undo that,\nI can move it to the right.\n\n470\n00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.870\nNow I have an opportunity\nof moving the actual text.\n\n471\n00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.553\nThere are many other things that I\ncould do with that boundary there.\n\n472\n00:27:10.553 --> 00:27:14.778\nI can right-click it and\ngo to Format Shape.\n\n473\n00:27:14.778 --> 00:27:17.010\nIn there, I can do many things.\n\n474\n00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:21.050\nNow, for now we're not yet\ngoing into each of these.\n\n475\n00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.200\nBut basically, that border that I'm\nworking with under which I can put text,\n\n476\n00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.420\nyou know,\nI can manipulate the text how I want it.\n\n477\n00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.234\nWell, I want to move it\na little bit to the right, so\n\n478\n00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:35.841\nthat it's not according to\nthe original design that I was given.\n\n479\n00:27:35.841 --> 00:27:39.157\nCan say, well, I want to move it to\nthe right a little bit, so I say, well,\n\n480\n00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.920\na few more inches to the right.\n\n481\n00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.697\nAnd then close and\nthe text moves a little bit.\n\n482\n00:27:43.697 --> 00:27:51.510\nI can say I want to put a little\nbackground on it that will come later.\n\n483\n00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.100\nBut let say I want to\ninsert something else.\n\n484\n00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:00.670\nSo I want to insert an image\nIn my same document,\n\n485\n00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.050\nor let's say I start a new slide,\nI say, well, I want to start a table.\n\n486\n00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.060\nI just go ahead and\nclick this table sign here or\n\n487\n00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.720\nI can come to Insert Section and\ninsert a table.\n\n488\n00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.000\nAnd there you go.\n\n489\n00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.148\nI have two cells, three cells,\n[SOUND] going down.\n\n490\n00:28:16.148 --> 00:28:17.680\nI have a table, and then,\n\n491\n00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.060\nof course, if I click right now on\nthese cells I can insert anything.\n\n492\n00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:26.370\nTable one, details, there you go, and\n\n493\n00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:30.380\nI can change the design of this table\njust like I do in Microsoft Word.\n\n494\n00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.968\nI can click variety of the content,\nI will click it.\n\n495\n00:28:32.968 --> 00:28:36.260\nAnd then I'll have various options\nof how that table can look like.\n\n496\n00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.389\nIf you want a different color,\nI normally like these kind\n\n497\n00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:42.597\nof colors because they bring\nlife to the document, yeah?\n\n498\n00:28:42.597 --> 00:28:48.250\nI will also insert a new slide and\nthen I say well I want to insert an image.\n\n499\n00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.780\nSo images are powerful,\nso quickly there you go,\n\n500\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.040\nI select an image, double click it.\n\n501\n00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.350\nAnd it loads.\n\n502\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.660\nNow I have an image in my slide.\n\n503\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:02.920\nSo you see I have two slides,\none is a table, one is an image.\n\n504\n00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.949\nLet me move on and say I want to insert\na slide right in the middle here.\n\n505\n00:29:07.949 --> 00:29:11.397\nAnd in this one I go to Insert.\n\n506\n00:29:11.397 --> 00:29:15.613\nWell, I think I can start clip art here,\nand then,\n\n507\n00:29:15.613 --> 00:29:20.140\nI pick something, and\nlet's see what image comes up.\n\n508\n00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.570\nYes, there we go.\n\n509\n00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:27.305\nSo I want to be a little happy today,\nand I start something, right?\n\n510\n00:29:27.305 --> 00:29:28.820\nI'm enjoying myself, right?\n\n511\n00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.120\nReally happy.\n\n512\n00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.840\nNow, I've got, I've started\na few things here, really quick.\n\n513\n00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.350\nI can import from some\nexisting document or,\n\n514\n00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.140\nI can copy from something and\npaste over here.\n\n515\n00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:45.936\nI can insert something that already\nexists in the computer, and there we go.\n\n516\n00:29:45.936 --> 00:29:48.880\nIn a little while,\nI start having something taking shape.\n\n517\n00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.290\n>> There's no doubt that by in\nthese extra elements, right?\n\n518\n00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:57.720\nThe whole goal here is to make that impact\npoint that we want to be able to make.\n\n519\n00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.660\nSo it normally gives us that ability\nto very easily create what we want to\n\n520\n00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.710\nby using those icons that are generally\ninside of one of those slides.\n\n521\n00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:10.310\nSo instead of you having to figure out,\ndo I need to click here or\n\n522\n00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.090\ndo I need to put my cursor over here.\n\n523\n00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.290\nPowerPoint just says, well here's the box\nthat the image is gonna show up in, or\n\n524\n00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.130\nthe table that's gonna show up in.\n\n525\n00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.590\nAnd you can simply create it, and it will\nautomatically locate it on that slide for\n\n526\n00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:27.430\nyou, and it'll allow you to again\nbring that information over.\n\n527\n00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.754\nSo it is a very intuitive tool because you\ndon't really need a lot of instructions\n\n528\n00:30:31.754 --> 00:30:32.269\nto do so.\n\n529\n00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:35.794\nYou just need to think about where\ndo you want things showing up and\n\n530\n00:30:35.794 --> 00:30:38.330\nhow do you want them actually looking.\n\n531\n00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.080\nAnd that way as long as you know what\npoint you wanna make PowerPoint will help\n\n532\n00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.580\nyou to be able to make that very easily\njust like what Dr. Omwansa showed you.\n\n533\n00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:50.700\nVery easy then to insert in an image,\na clip art, create a table, or\n\n534\n00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.450\nto actually insert the table\nfrom another product.\n\n535\n00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.820\nYou can definitely do stuff\nlike that to help you out.\n\n536\n00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:01.150\nAnd you even have the ability to go on and\neven do video and audio clips.\n\n537\n00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.778\nYou have them available for you.\n\n538\n00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:07.794\nAnd Dr. Omwansa, I use this all the time\nwhen I, actually when my daughter was\n\n539\n00:31:07.794 --> 00:31:12.962\nborn, I created, of course, I took tons\nof pictures when my daughter was born.\n\n540\n00:31:12.962 --> 00:31:14.890\nBut then I took a little piece of music,\n\n541\n00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.864\nand I set it in the background to play,\nas that actually created a slideshow, and\n\n542\n00:31:18.864 --> 00:31:22.710\nallowed the entire thing to play as\nit actually went through the slides.\n\n543\n00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.252\nSo it actually was one element, and then\nI could send that to her grandparents.\n\n544\n00:31:26.252 --> 00:31:29.520\nAnd I could send it to friends so that\nthey can actually see all the pictures and\n\n545\n00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.750\nhave the piece of music in the background.\n\n546\n00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.411\nAnd so\nyou can actually use that in that way too.\n\n547\n00:31:34.411 --> 00:31:38.477\nAnd that's all I did, I simply clicked on\nthat icon and there I was, I was off and\n\n548\n00:31:38.477 --> 00:31:39.510\nready to go.\n\n549\n00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.010\nAnd I didn't really know much about\nPowerPoint at that point, but\n\n550\n00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.040\nI was able to figure it out very\neasily because it is such and\n\n551\n00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.270\nintuitive type of application that we see.\n\n552\n00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:53.470\n>> So similarly you can do charts,\nI man you can insert a chart and\n\n553\n00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.280\nyou can actually even manipulate\nthe data of the chart.\n\n554\n00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:00.620\nIn fact I find the chart is very,\nvery interesting thing, look at all those\n\n555\n00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:05.980\noptions and\nif I click the chart icon there,\n\n556\n00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.220\nInsert Chart, I selected the chart and\nthen say okay.\n\n557\n00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.270\nSee what happens.\n\n558\n00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.660\nAutomatically it picks data\nfrom some table somewhere and\n\n559\n00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.060\npresents a chart on my\nPowerPoint presentation.\n\n560\n00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.773\nIf I come in here and change, I say\nwell instead of 4.5 I'm going to say 10.\n\n561\n00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:24.530\nAs you could see something\nalready changes over there.\n\n562\n00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:28.893\nIf I minimize this and maximize my\nPowerPoint I'd already have a chart.\n\n563\n00:32:28.893 --> 00:32:32.197\nSo, you know,\nit's really easy and creative.\n\n564\n00:32:32.197 --> 00:32:35.130\nAnd then it's interesting cuz you see,\nyou see.\n\n565\n00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.700\nYou're not spending a lot of energy,\nyou know,\n\n566\n00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.350\nthinking through about some\nalgorithm theme or some formula yet.\n\n567\n00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.360\nBut you're beginning to see results and\n\n568\n00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.390\nyou can change even that chart, you can\nplay around with colors real quick.\n\n569\n00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.862\nAnd you get your results, so.\n\n570\n00:32:49.862 --> 00:32:52.802\nYou know, I want to believe that\nin as much as we have a lot more\n\n571\n00:32:52.802 --> 00:32:55.320\nwe can talk about we\ndon't have a lot of time.\n\n572\n00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:59.360\nThis section we've covered right now\nshould have formed a very good foundation\n\n573\n00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.500\nso that you can peak, feel confident\nthat you can make your own presentation.\n\n574\n00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.892\nWhen we get to part two we'll get\na little more detailed and make some more\n\n575\n00:33:07.892 --> 00:33:12.221\ninteresting presentations and\nthen we'll release you to go and do it.\n\n576\n00:33:12.221 --> 00:33:13.476\n>> All right, Dr. Omwansa.\n\n577\n00:33:13.476 --> 00:33:15.696\nThank you again and\nwe're looking forward to that part two.\n\n578\n00:33:15.696 --> 00:33:18.500\nWe're gonna see a lot more of\nthis actually available to us.\n\n579\n00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.660\nEven though what we showed\nyou here is the basics,\n\n580\n00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.440\nthere's a lot more things\nthat you can add in.\n\n581\n00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.370\nEven some different animations, and you're\ngonna see that in our part two as well.\n\n582\n00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:29.560\nBut stay tuned for that as well, and\nthat's a great place for us to end.\n\n583\n00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.658\nSo signing off for ITProTV.\n\n584\n00:33:31.658 --> 00:33:33.529\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n585\n00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:36.988\n>> And my name is Dr.\nTonny Omwansa, learning together.\n\n586\n00:33:36.988 --> 00:33:40.892\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore of Computing Fundamentals.\n\n587\n00:33:40.892 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:15.640\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode here ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.110\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.510\nyou're watching\nthe Computing Fundamentals IC3 show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.090\nNow, what we're about to take\na look at is a part two,\n\n6\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.100\nof introducing ourselves\nto Microsoft PowerPoint,\n\n7\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.180\none of the most powerful presentation\ntools that we have available to us.\n\n8\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.848\nAnd we've already taken a look at some\nof the basic ways that we can create\n\n9\n00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:33.750\npresentations.\n\n10\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.980\nBut we have a lot more to go, and\n\n11\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.216\nwho better to help us to continue to\nlearn about that than Dr. Tonny Omwansa.\n\n12\n00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:41.170\nDr. Omwansa, welcome back to our studios.\n\n13\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.440\n>> Thank you very much, it's just\nenjoying always learning together.\n\n14\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.090\nAnd now we're beginning\nto gravitate to a little\n\n15\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.560\nmore sophisticated elements of PowerPoint.\n\n16\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.890\nThis is the last section of PowerPoint and\n\n17\n00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.250\nwe believe we have empowered\nour learners to get better.\n\n18\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.140\n>> All right, so we've already seen\nsome of the different elements.\n\n19\n00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.520\nWe now know how to get some information\nonto each one of our PowerPoint slides.\n\n20\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.229\nWe know that we can insert\nin objects like tables and\n\n21\n00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.688\nimages, as well as even audio and\nvideo clips.\n\n22\n00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:15.808\nSo what else do we have left to cover Dr.\nOmwansa?\n\n23\n00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:20.014\n>> Okay, so we have two things that we're\ngonna spend our time now as we begin to\n\n24\n00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:21.830\nconclude in PowerPoint.\n\n25\n00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.720\nAnd the first one is something\ncalled smart SmartArt.\n\n26\n00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.530\nOne thing I really enjoy to use is\nSmartArt because it has a powerful way of\n\n27\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.510\ncombining shapes with text to\ncreate some very informative and\n\n28\n00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.890\nvisually interesting patterns.\n\n29\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.730\nSo if you get to your computer and\nhave your PowerPoint on,\n\n30\n00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:50.240\nI have displayed some field images\nof what SmartArt is able to do.\n\n31\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.190\nYou can see something interesting,\nyou have images and\n\n32\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.200\ntext, the designs are already pretty fine.\n\n33\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.950\nAnd then you can manipulate them and\nmodify the text here and there, and\n\n34\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.605\nyou can see the color combination\nmakes it interesting to see.\n\n35\n00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:08.470\nSo think about it, when you're\nmaking a presentation to people,\n\n36\n00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.920\nyou wanna captivate them.\n\n37\n00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.266\nYou wanna make sure their\nattention is right there so\n\n38\n00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.150\nthat you can communicate what\nyou need to communicate.\n\n39\n00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.430\nSo let's just illustrate exactly how do we\ncreate some simple SmartArt, all right.\n\n40\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.160\nSo what I'm going to do is\nI just open a new page,\n\n41\n00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.180\na new slide,\nI'm just creating a new slide, so simple.\n\n42\n00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.030\nI go to the Insert tab, and then I go\nto the Illlustrations over here, and\n\n43\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.390\nI pick SmartArt, and\nit points me to some examples.\n\n44\n00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.080\nAll of them classified together.\n\n45\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.230\nThere are different types.\n\n46\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.830\nThere are those which are called lists,\nprocesses.\n\n47\n00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.880\nWhen you wan to think about an\norganization, how do things move around?\n\n48\n00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.030\nAnd you want to communicate\nhow we will get there.\n\n49\n00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.790\nIf you start step one and\nmove to step two, etc.\n\n50\n00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.620\nOr something is in circular format,\nwe always loop around.\n\n51\n00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.870\nI like those models like loop methodology.\n\n52\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.480\nSo you're saying you're\nstarting with a very simple,\n\n53\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.040\nwhat is the problem,\nwhat is the prototype?\n\n54\n00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.730\nGetting customer insights, and\ncreate a final product, and\n\n55\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.230\nloop back and then you start increasing.\n\n56\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.190\nSo you can very easily\ncreate something like that.\n\n57\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.400\nThink about, for example, chains.\n\n58\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.450\nThis wheel turns, and\nthen it turns another wheel and\n\n59\n00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.770\nanother wheel over there.\n\n60\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.570\nAnd then you want to say,\n\n61\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.580\nwhat do you want to put in-between\nthere to explain how that wheel moves?\n\n62\n00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.340\nThink about a chart like this,\ncomponents of a whole.\n\n63\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.820\nWe have the element of hierarchy.\n\n64\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.520\nIn an organization, we structure\nthings in a hierarchical manner.\n\n65\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.560\nSo you can say, well, maybe there's\nsomeone who heads the organization,\n\n66\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.450\nand then is assisted by someone, and\nright below there are three deputies, and\n\n67\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.520\nthings like that.\n\n68\n00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.300\nOr you could put it in horizontal format,\nand\n\n69\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.940\nyou're running from the right to the left,\nor left to the right.\n\n70\n00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.980\nWe may want to demonstrate relationships.\n\n71\n00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.300\nThink about how things are related.\n\n72\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.730\nIf you move this, then this one\nmoves in a certain direction.\n\n73\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.154\nOr if you have a list of things, and\nyou say they are connected in some way.\n\n74\n00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:15.315\nWe can have matrixes, we have pyramids,\nwe have got pictures,\n\n75\n00:04:15.315 --> 00:04:18.280\nwe've got Office 2000, Office.com.\n\n76\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.610\nBut let's just go to All and\npick something and say, well,\n\n77\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.770\nwe want to show how that SmartArt works.\n\n78\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.310\nFor me I find it is a very,\n\n79\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.940\nvery interesting tool in making\npresentations attractive.\n\n80\n00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.560\nSo let's just hypothetically say,\nI want to show some kind of free pyramid.\n\n81\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.240\nAnd I say OK, here.\n\n82\n00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.360\nThis pyramid is communicating\nsomething that maybe, at the base,\n\n83\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.050\nwe've got primary school kids.\n\n84\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.110\nAnd maybe we want to portray an image\nthat as children move up the ladder\n\n85\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.780\nin their education program\nsomething seems to happen.\n\n86\n00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.370\nMaybe we already have\ndata to explain that.\n\n87\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.910\nSo I can say this is secondary school, and\n\n88\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.780\nthen this is university, or\ntertiary for that matter.\n\n89\n00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.570\nSo maybe we've done some statistics and\nwe've done some research, and\n\n90\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.350\nwe can see that there are a lot more\nkids in primary school, and they get\n\n91\n00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.400\nfewer as you go to high school, and get a\nlot more fewer when you get to university.\n\n92\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.350\nNow, in just a matter of seconds I've\nmade a very interesting presentation.\n\n93\n00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.630\nAnd I can simply put a title to it.\n\n94\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.226\nI want to believe that\nif we do several others,\n\n95\n00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:35.870\nI can quickly pick another and say,\nwell, let me go to insert SmartArt.\n\n96\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.390\nI say, well, I want to show a relationship\nbetween things, so I can say let me go\n\n97\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.248\nthrough a process and say this is how\nwe're gonna go over the next five years.\n\n98\n00:05:45.248 --> 00:05:48.780\nI could complete that, I can change\nthe color if I want, that's not a problem.\n\n99\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.610\nAnd say okay, Year 1, and\n\n100\n00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.040\nthen we're gonna say, Year 2,\nand we'll say Year 3.\n\n101\n00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.970\nAnd this is all ready a very powerful\nway of presenting progression over time.\n\n102\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.850\nAnd I can put a description here.\n\n103\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.260\nI can go and insert some simple text.\n\n104\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.480\nAnd say, well, let me put text books here,\nand put in data and\n\n105\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.160\nduration of what exactly will happen.\n\n106\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.505\nWe will launch the program, all right.\n\n107\n00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:20.603\nDon't worry about too much about what\nI do, but I'm basically copying.\n\n108\n00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:24.690\nAnd then I move these up, and I say\nthis is what we are gonna do in Year 2.\n\n109\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.593\nWe'll basically evaluate and\n\n110\n00:06:30.593 --> 00:06:34.456\nconsider scaling.\n\n111\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.599\nAnd then in Year 3, we will redesign.\n\n112\n00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:51.322\nSo in a very little while,\nI'm already communicating, and\n\n113\n00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:56.237\nI can make whatever changes I want to, but\nI'm already communicating something over\n\n114\n00:06:56.237 --> 00:06:59.650\na period of time showing\nhow things are connected.\n\n115\n00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.720\nAnd I want to believe\nyou've used these tools.\n\n116\n00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.938\nThere is no way you may\nhave not used them.\n\n117\n00:07:04.938 --> 00:07:08.030\n>> No, there is no doubt that I've\nactually used these in several different\n\n118\n00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.530\nthings here, especially when you're new,\nand you're having to present some type of\n\n119\n00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.490\ninformation that is organizational or\nrelated in some way.\n\n120\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.910\nAnd the ability of these\ntools is fairly simple.\n\n121\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.210\nIt means I do not have to\nstart from scratch paper.\n\n122\n00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.700\nYou always hear the analogy\nof recreating the wheel.\n\n123\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.190\nWell, here they're saying, look,\nuse these that will help you to at least\n\n124\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.050\nhave a foundational graphic that you\ncan now tie either that process to, or\n\n125\n00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.898\nthat relationship to, that really\nhelp you emphasize what you need.\n\n126\n00:07:41.898 --> 00:07:45.264\nA majority of times that I've\nused them in is to make sure that\n\n127\n00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:49.752\npeople understand the hierarchical\nrelationship inside of the organization,\n\n128\n00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:54.381\nto help them understand who they are going\nto report to if they need to do something.\n\n129\n00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:59.060\nI've also use this in the process of\nsomething like a flowchart to show them\n\n130\n00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.217\nthat here are the steps that we need\nto take if we come to some point of\n\n131\n00:08:03.217 --> 00:08:04.279\nan evaluation.\n\n132\n00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:07.996\nHere's a yes and here's a no, or\nhere's what the results should be if\n\n133\n00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:11.870\nit's not that, go here instead,\nthat where we can actually see that.\n\n134\n00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.940\nWell, drawing those things out on paper\ncan be a little bit more nightmarish.\n\n135\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.380\nBut the great thing is since PowerPoint\nalready has some of those tools built in,\n\n136\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.990\nwe simply select that and then we can\nactually learn how to to just simply add\n\n137\n00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.880\nin our text and make sure that the diagram\nis showing what we want it to show and\n\n138\n00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.050\nthat is clearly the function.\n\n139\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.370\nA lot of times, the reason why we need\nthese in presentations is because well, we\n\n140\n00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.300\nmight not have been clear when we thought\nthat we sent it in an email correctly.\n\n141\n00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.000\nSo creating this inside\nof the presentation\n\n142\n00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.150\nallows us to be able to show that and\nto emphasize those points fairly easily\n\n143\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.100\nwith a graphic as well as with the words,\nand then hopefully being able to of\n\n144\n00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.930\ncourse answer those questions that\nare actually brought up when they see it.\n\n145\n00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.440\nBut if you're creating\na PowerPoint presentation,\n\n146\n00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.710\nhopefully you've already asked those\nquestions about your own PowerPoint.\n\n147\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.180\nIs this going to answer all the questions\nthat I think somebody would have on it?\n\n148\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.630\nAnd then that way you tweak it and\nyou actually adjust it to what you need.\n\n149\n00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.510\nBut these are very powerful ways to\nmake a very clear point with a lot of\n\n150\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.790\ninformation, once again, especially on\nprocesses and on organizational matters.\n\n151\n00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:26.214\nThis is one of the clearest ways to do so\nto a very large group of people.\n\n152\n00:09:26.214 --> 00:09:32.144\n>> All right, just before moving through,\nI wanna talk about animations and\n\n153\n00:09:32.144 --> 00:09:36.730\npreparing your PowerPoint presentation for\nusage.\n\n154\n00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.520\nRight on my screen,\nI basically pointed out some simple\n\n155\n00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.846\ndesigns that have been done.\n\n156\n00:09:44.846 --> 00:09:48.820\nI just picked them from the book,\nto show how something,\n\n157\n00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.970\nsome processes could look like, you know,\nvery easy organization of structure.\n\n158\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.310\nDemonstrating, you know,\n\n159\n00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.820\npositions, so it's the same thing\nthat we've been talking about,\n\n160\n00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.490\ntalking about a sequence of things and\nthe direction that things are going.\n\n161\n00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.620\nSo there are very many possible things\nthat you could possibly create.\n\n162\n00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:12.700\nSo after saying that, now, let's move\non to transitions and animations.\n\n163\n00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:19.990\nThis is another very interesting feature\nof Microsoft PowerPoint and I found it as\n\n164\n00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.820\na mechanism that really entertains people\nwhenever they are watching a presentation.\n\n165\n00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.400\nBut I must put some\nlittle caution over here.\n\n166\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.110\nThere's a temptation to overdo it.\n\n167\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.790\nAnd sometimes you might\nover-entertain people that they\n\n168\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:38.910\nforget what exactly the substance is and\nthen get carried away in the animation.\n\n169\n00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.700\nWhoa whoa whoa, that one is coming from\nup, that's from the left, etc, and\n\n170\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.400\nthings like that.\n\n171\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.542\nSo you must strike a very good balance\nbetween communicating what you need to and\n\n172\n00:10:48.542 --> 00:10:52.410\ndistracting people from the substance\nof your presentation and\n\n173\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.650\nthen they get carried away to the hows,\nthe sound there.\n\n174\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.100\nYou press a button and\nsomething else flies in from the right and\n\n175\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.380\nleft and sent and everything.\n\n176\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.990\nYou can find people in a presentation\nlaughing and really looking happy and\n\n177\n00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.960\nyou mistaken that to mean they're\nenjoying your presentation, but\n\n178\n00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.110\nthey've basically lost the focus and\nnow they're focusing on the presentation.\n\n179\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.900\nBut all the same,\nwe're gonna know what it is, and\n\n180\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.560\nwe're gonna try to figure out\nhow to use it effectively.\n\n181\n00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.030\nSo I've just put together\nsome simple slides here.\n\n182\n00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.823\nSo, slide number one is\nthat I've put an image, and\n\n183\n00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:36.970\nif I go to the tab on Animation, I already\nhave some options that I could pick from.\n\n184\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.035\nAnd as I scroll all over, you know\nwhen there's none nothing happens.\n\n185\n00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:44.500\nIf it's Appear,\nit will give me some idea of appearing.\n\n186\n00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:52.070\nFading, flying in, floating,\nsplitting, wiping, shape, wheel.\n\n187\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.250\nSo just for us to appreciate what that is,\nI've already pointed and\n\n188\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.060\nit shows exactly what that is.\n\n189\n00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:02.120\nSo if I click it, that means I've applied\nthat design to that particular image.\n\n190\n00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.920\nSo I must have decided what do I\nwant to apply an animation to,\n\n191\n00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.420\nso as I click the image and\nI selected Wheel,\n\n192\n00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.320\nyou'll see right here at the top of\nthat image, there is a number one there.\n\n193\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.130\nSo what that tells you is if we have\ndifferent things in that particular page,\n\n194\n00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:25.140\nso for example, if we had several images\nwe can actually have animation for\n\n195\n00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.520\neach of them and\n\n196\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.700\nthen the sequence of the numbering\nwill tell me how they will appear.\n\n197\n00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.740\nSo there is the animation for a particular\nimage and then there is the sequence\n\n198\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.080\nwith which all the images or objects\nthat we've put in that presentation.\n\n199\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.562\nIt can be text, it can be a table,\nit can be a diagram.\n\n200\n00:12:46.562 --> 00:12:49.930\nAnd they can all appear with\nsome form of animation.\n\n201\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.100\nAnd animations are many,\nthere are different kinds of animations.\n\n202\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.160\nJust to demonstrate,\nlet me pick Add Animation.\n\n203\n00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.330\nIf you see Add Animation,\n\n204\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.970\nthere is a whole list of animation that\nhad been presented here, and you can pick.\n\n205\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.870\nI mean if you like bouncing, the people\nwho like bouncing, you're like whoa,\n\n206\n00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.470\nsomething coming up and down.\n\n207\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.600\nAnd then someone says,\nthere's or it's a line.\n\n208\n00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.110\nYeah, and there is a ton,\nit look like some traffic, maybe a cone.\n\n209\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.720\nNow look at that loop,\ndoesn't sound that interesting, okay.\n\n210\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.450\nThere you go.\n\n211\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.290\nOr it can be a custom path,\nI can actually create a custom path and\n\n212\n00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.460\nsay well I want something to go\nlike that and then end it there.\n\n213\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.910\nWell, that looks really strange, yeah?\n\n214\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.340\nBut all of that is possible and\nthere we go.\n\n215\n00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.880\nI can play and then look at that.\n\n216\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.170\nThere you go.\n\n217\n00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.510\nSo all of that is possible.\n\n218\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.280\nYou can create something for yourself or\nyou can pick some existing one.\n\n219\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.790\nSo here's an example that I just\ncreated a little while ago, and\n\n220\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.990\nthen I say, well,\nI'll have someone smiling, then really,\n\n221\n00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.710\nreally happy, and\nthen blown up really, really excited.\n\n222\n00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n223\n00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.430\nthat becomes some kind of a sequence.\n\n224\n00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.740\nAnd then say well, I want to play that and\nsee how that looks.\n\n225\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.580\nThe first guy goes, the second guy,\nand the third guy goes.\n\n226\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.240\nSo you can play with that and\nsay different animations for\n\n227\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.680\ndifferent things, and then the sequence\nof animation, you can also work on it.\n\n228\n00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.400\nNow, you can decide to reorganize this,\njust like we organize the slides.\n\n229\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.470\nWe can say, well, I want this one to\ncome first, but you see, as it is,\n\n230\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.560\nit's number two.\n\n231\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.720\nSo over here, the animation pin\ngives you an opportunity to order\n\n232\n00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.940\nwhere the images are going to,\nthe sequence with which they will come.\n\n233\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:40.530\nSo I can click this and drag it up,\nthen it becomes number one, all right?\n\n234\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.380\nSo this now becomes number one,\nnumber two, number three.\n\n235\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.330\nSo it means this will appear first.\n\n236\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.600\nIf I don't want it to appear here,\nI can change the position.\n\n237\n00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.590\nBut as you can tell, this is now my\nnumber one, this is my number two,\n\n238\n00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.800\nthis is my number three.\n\n239\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.410\nSo I can easily move them around.\n\n240\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.820\nIf I want to change the kind of animation,\nI have the flexibility.\n\n241\n00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.700\nIf I want to say,\n\n242\n00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:08.300\nafter the last one appears then I want\nthis one to appear automatically, or\n\n243\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.550\nI want it to appear when I have\npressed enter, or back on this screen.\n\n244\n00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.940\nSo there's all that flexibility.\n\n245\n00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.945\nIf I want it to come very fast,\nI also have that option.\n\n246\n00:15:17.945 --> 00:15:21.075\nIf I want it to come very slowly,\n\n247\n00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:23.785\nlike slow motion,\nall that possibility is there.\n\n248\n00:15:23.785 --> 00:15:28.695\nSo as you practice and as you play\naround with the Animation pane and\n\n249\n00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:33.877\nlooking at the options of timing here, the\nkind of effect that it's going to have.\n\n250\n00:15:33.877 --> 00:15:36.147\nWhich direction does it come from?\n\n251\n00:15:36.147 --> 00:15:37.077\nWhat triggers it?\n\n252\n00:15:37.077 --> 00:15:41.277\nIs it a click, or is it because\nthe previous one has ended, or\n\n253\n00:15:41.277 --> 00:15:43.997\nis it because we have a new\npage that has appeared?\n\n254\n00:15:43.997 --> 00:15:45.647\nAll those things,\nwe can play around with them and\n\n255\n00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:50.547\ncreate very interesting animations and you\ncan have very interesting presentations.\n\n256\n00:15:50.547 --> 00:15:51.077\nThink about it.\n\n257\n00:15:51.077 --> 00:15:53.575\nTheir use can be valid.\n\n258\n00:15:53.575 --> 00:15:57.907\nIf you're doing this for children,\nlike my colleague here just said,\n\n259\n00:15:57.907 --> 00:16:02.237\nwhen the little baby was born he was\nable to pull together some images and\n\n260\n00:16:02.237 --> 00:16:04.639\nput some interesting sound behind it.\n\n261\n00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:06.466\nFor children it can be very,\nvery entertaining.\n\n262\n00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.447\nSo, the usage really depends.\n\n263\n00:16:08.447 --> 00:16:11.230\nYou can put all\nthe animations you want here.\n\n264\n00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:16.610\nIn more corporate forums, you kinda want\nto moderate the use of animation because\n\n265\n00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:21.030\nyou can distract people from\nthe formal conversations.\n\n266\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:26.030\nBut, no matter what, this is a useful tool\nthat, depending on what forum you are in,\n\n267\n00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.500\nor why you wanna use it,\nit can really, really be interesting.\n\n268\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.250\n>> Even in an instructional environment,\nDr. Almonda,\n\n269\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:37.345\nthis is one of the things that do us\nin presentations so that, if I don't\n\n270\n00:16:37.345 --> 00:16:41.720\nwanna reveal too much of what I'm about\nto talk about, then I can focus in, and\n\n271\n00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:47.070\nI can just have my particular main point\nSlide right in, or transition into that.\n\n272\n00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:52.070\nAnd make sure that I lecture, or I teach,\nor I instruct on that particular point.\n\n273\n00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.080\nAnd then, I can say, all right,\nnow let's move on to point two.\n\n274\n00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.630\nHave that one fade out in the background,\nand have the other one come up.\n\n275\n00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.380\nSo that way, I'm literally directing it,\n\n276\n00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.250\ninstead of somebody trying to race through\nthe points that I made on that one slide.\n\n277\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.253\nUsing the transitions,\njust like Dr. Almonda said,\n\n278\n00:17:08.253 --> 00:17:12.650\nit can be powerful if you use it in\nthe right amount and in the right context.\n\n279\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.420\nBut it can be so distracting when\nyou just have it in there for\n\n280\n00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.360\nthe sake of having it in there.\n\n281\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.330\nSo, the whole goal behind this is what\ndo you really need to do with it.\n\n282\n00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.710\nAre you trying to make\na point about the speed?\n\n283\n00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.000\nWell, if you are you can do\nthat where you're saying,\n\n284\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.070\nlook, I've got 10 slides, and I wanna\nget through this as quickly as possible.\n\n285\n00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.560\nAnd you show where you're actually\ncontrolling that, and you\n\n286\n00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.160\nhave even the animations be a little bit\nspeedy as you transition in between them.\n\n287\n00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.570\nIt makes the point that you really\nare going to get through this\n\n288\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.670\nas quickly as you say that you are.\n\n289\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.970\nBut if you are trying to make a point by\nsaying, look, I've got six points that I\n\n290\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.255\nneed to cover, but I need you to focus\nin on each and everyone of those points.\n\n291\n00:17:52.255 --> 00:17:54.930\nI'm don't wanna show all\nsix of them at one time.\n\n292\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.860\nI just wanna show one of them at a time,\nand I wanna keep their attention,\n\n293\n00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.140\nand I wanna keep holding it.\n\n294\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.490\nSo, I only show point number one, right?\n\n295\n00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.500\nAt the beginning.\n\n296\n00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.990\nAnd then, I show point number two.\n\n297\n00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.670\nI show point number three.\n\n298\n00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.420\nBut if this is for something fun, or\neven for kids like we talked about,\n\n299\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.800\na lot of times, the more animation,\nthe more they're gonna pay attention.\n\n300\n00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.890\nBecause it does remind them\nof a cartoon just about,\n\n301\n00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.960\nin which all kids tend to love\nsome type of animation there, and\n\n302\n00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.580\nallows them to go actually he's\ntrying to make a point here.\n\n303\n00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.860\nSo, you can see where this can be very\neffective in a teaching environment,\n\n304\n00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.760\nas well as in an environment in which\nyou need to control the pacing and\n\n305\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.920\neverything else that you\nactually have around it.\n\n306\n00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.140\nOr you can simply list everything,\nlike I do a lot of times, and\n\n307\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.300\njust go if you get all of it, you get\nall of it, and you don't worry about it.\n\n308\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.250\nBut this is the idea.\n\n309\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.580\nThe more time that you spend with it, the\nmore effective you can make your points.\n\n310\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.020\nAnimations can really help you do that.\n\n311\n00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.050\n>> Great.\n\n312\n00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:47.870\nSo, there you are.\n\n313\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.870\nYou've got some presentation.\n\n314\n00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.330\nYou have it in design.\n\n315\n00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.530\nYou've thought about the theme.\n\n316\n00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.620\nYou've thought about the tables.\n\n317\n00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.460\nYou probably have put them in there.\n\n318\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.794\nYou've created some text or\nparagraph in there, some bullet point.\n\n319\n00:19:01.794 --> 00:19:04.540\nYou went ahead and put in some images.\n\n320\n00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.633\nYou played around with those images.\n\n321\n00:19:06.633 --> 00:19:11.460\nAnd then, you got very excited and you put\nin some transitions and some animations.\n\n322\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.920\nAnd now,\nyou have a very nice presentation.\n\n323\n00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.840\nNext, is you want to make a presentation.\n\n324\n00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.840\nThat's why it is a presentation.\n\n325\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.910\nSo, what are you gonna to do?\n\n326\n00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:26.520\nSo, look, the layout here,\nyou are using this to design.\n\n327\n00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.080\nSo, if I just scroll down, I've created\nall these things, and they are all there.\n\n328\n00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.630\nWhen you go to make a presentation,\n\n329\n00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:39.060\nchances are you'll probably put it\non projector and project on a wall.\n\n330\n00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.310\nOr if you're doing it to a few people,\n\n331\n00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.840\nyou might be able to put your laptop or\ndevice, whatever the device,\n\n332\n00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.360\nand people can come around your\ncomputer and then they can see.\n\n333\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.840\nSo, you really don't want them\nto see all these design things,\n\n334\n00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.090\nand all these layouts.\n\n335\n00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.730\nYou just want them to\nfocus on the presentation.\n\n336\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.890\nSo, what you're going to do is\nyou're gonna play the presentation.\n\n337\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.370\nAnd then, you can scroll through\ndepending on how you've designed it,\n\n338\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.700\nwhether it is automatically, sometimes you\nhave some control device that you use,\n\n339\n00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.780\nwhich is an input device.\n\n340\n00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.490\nIs that correct?\n\n341\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.020\n>> Correct.\n\n342\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.930\n>> Where you send an instruction\nto the computer and say move next.\n\n343\n00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.085\nAnd so,\nsometimes you also have a pointer that you\n\n344\n00:20:18.085 --> 00:20:22.005\ncan use to point to whatever that\npresentation is being projected.\n\n345\n00:20:23.145 --> 00:20:27.535\nAnd then that becomes a powerful way so\nyou can stand out of the presentation, and\n\n346\n00:20:27.535 --> 00:20:32.450\njust focus on the content,\nand engage your audience.\n\n347\n00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:39.250\n>> So, all you're going to do here,\nis you're gonna click the tab slideshow.\n\n348\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:43.290\nAnd on the slideshow, you have an option\nof starting from the beginning or\n\n349\n00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.080\nstarting from the current slide.\n\n350\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.260\nReally, to a large extent\nthose are the main ones, yeah?\n\n351\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.360\nAnd there is a shortcut\nsomewhere down here\n\n352\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.280\nat the status bar where you\ncan actually say Slideshow.\n\n353\n00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.500\nAnd if you click it, now there you have.\n\n354\n00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.980\nAnd as you can see,\nall those design issues,\n\n355\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.380\nall those stubs and\nall those memos are not there anymore.\n\n356\n00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.300\nNow, you just have the presentation\nthat you've worked on.\n\n357\n00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.270\nAnd if I click Enter,\ntakes me to the next slide.\n\n358\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.821\nI click the next one,\ntakes me to the next slide.\n\n359\n00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:13.976\nAnd the next one.\n\n360\n00:21:13.976 --> 00:21:15.916\nAnd the next one.\n\n361\n00:21:15.916 --> 00:21:16.760\nBoom, boom.\n\n362\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.237\nAnd the next one.\n\n363\n00:21:18.237 --> 00:21:20.202\nAnd I'm done, and there you go.\n\n364\n00:21:20.202 --> 00:21:21.391\nAnd there you go.\n\n365\n00:21:21.391 --> 00:21:25.101\nAnd then, I can do, now I can talk about\nthis presentation, I can talk about this\n\n366\n00:21:25.101 --> 00:21:29.040\ntable, I can just talk about these\ncharts until I finish my presentation.\n\n367\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.710\nSo, I just wanna believe that\n\n368\n00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.200\nit gives you a sense of basically\nhow to manipulate the presentation.\n\n369\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:41.771\nAnd then, you can always come back and\nmake changes, and save the file,\n\n370\n00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:46.642\nand then distribute it, and\nuse it again for other presentations.\n\n371\n00:21:46.642 --> 00:21:51.335\nI want you to believe that you've done\nsome presentations, my colleague.\n\n372\n00:21:51.335 --> 00:21:52.905\nYou've done presentations before?\n\n373\n00:21:52.905 --> 00:21:54.725\nAnd what has been the experience?\n\n374\n00:21:54.725 --> 00:21:59.075\nDistancing yourself from the presentation,\nthe design of the presentation.\n\n375\n00:21:59.075 --> 00:22:02.165\nCuz sometimes you spend a lot of time\nthinking, I'm gonna move this here.\n\n376\n00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.780\nIt take you a couple hours to put together\nthe whole presentation because you're\n\n377\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.730\nthinking about your users, you're thinking\nabout the people who are going to\n\n378\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.390\nwatch the presentation,\nthe people you need to explain to.\n\n379\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.595\nAnd then,\nyou only have five minutes to present.\n\n380\n00:22:14.595 --> 00:22:17.880\n[LAUGH]\n>> There is no doubt that I've actually\n\n381\n00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.411\nseen that happen where, you believe that\nyou have a lot that you actually need to\n\n382\n00:22:21.411 --> 00:22:23.800\npresent, and\nthen you're limited about that time.\n\n383\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.200\nThe neat thing about doing these\npresentations is even if you,\n\n384\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.050\nhopefully, you never will,\neven if you have 80 slides,\n\n385\n00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.635\nand all of a sudden they say, well, Dr.\nAlmondza, you only have five minutes.\n\n386\n00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:39.000\nWell, you can quickly go back in and\nactually hide those different slides so\n\n387\n00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.370\nthat you can only present what you\nbelieve you can present in five minutes.\n\n388\n00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.990\nYou don't have to create\na whole new PowerPoint slide.\n\n389\n00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.350\nYou can simply hide them, and then hit\nthat F5, or that presentation mode,\n\n390\n00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.810\nand it'll go through, and\nit'll skip all those hidden slides.\n\n391\n00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.590\nSo, they try and\ndive you the most power for\n\n392\n00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.130\nthe benefit that you\nhave the ability to do.\n\n393\n00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.130\nWhether you actually present everything\nthat you're actually told that you'll be\n\n394\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.150\nable to do, or\nwhether you have to condense it down.\n\n395\n00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.100\nYou can actually do things like that.\n\n396\n00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.790\nAnd so, having these PowerPoint\npresentations is very nice, and\n\n397\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.340\nthe ability for you to do that.\n\n398\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.619\nThe neatest thing I like about\nthe PowerPoint presentation, right?\n\n399\n00:23:13.619 --> 00:23:17.490\nHooking up that projector and\npresenting it, and seeing it go live, and\n\n400\n00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.520\nwatching everybody go, wow, that's neat.\n\n401\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.970\nIt's a great feeling because you\nknow that you spent the time, and\n\n402\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.560\nthat people appreciate it.\n\n403\n00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.230\n>> But the other thing about it is that\nyou can package up that PowerPoint\n\n404\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:32.200\npresentation and save it either on to one\nof those little thumb drives that you\n\n405\n00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.820\nhave, the USB thumb drives, or\nyou can even burn it to a disk.\n\n406\n00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.990\nAnd that way, you can send it to somebody,\n\n407\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.550\nand all they have to do\nis insert the disk in.\n\n408\n00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.290\nIt will make them install a small\napplication called the PowerPoint Viewer.\n\n409\n00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.710\nAnd then,\nthey can watch that presentation.\n\n410\n00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.410\nAnd you don't have to actually make\nsure that they have PowerPoint on their\n\n411\n00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.410\nmachine.\n\n412\n00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.968\nIt is a very powerful way for you to\ndistribute your PowerPoint presentation,\n\n413\n00:23:54.968 --> 00:23:58.294\neven in the absence of any\nPowerPoint on their machines.\n\n414\n00:23:58.294 --> 00:24:01.757\nAnd this is what I did when I\nwas talking about my daughter's,\n\n415\n00:24:01.757 --> 00:24:04.953\nthat really first month that\nshe was alive is I made one for\n\n416\n00:24:04.953 --> 00:24:08.238\nthat very first because we took so\nmany pictures.\n\n417\n00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:13.220\nBut I wanted to share that with her\ngrandparents on both sides of the family.\n\n418\n00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:13.820\nAt that point,\n\n419\n00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.580\nthey didn't have PowerPoint, so I was\nable to actually use that feature and\n\n420\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.520\nsend them each a CD of that PowerPoint and\nthey could just simply play it.\n\n421\n00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.690\nAnd it was amazing for\n\n422\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.510\nthem to actually be able to see\nwhat could be done very easily.\n\n423\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.440\nAll of that was before I really had\nany training in PowerPoint at all.\n\n424\n00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.400\nBut now that I've been teaching it for\nyears and\n\n425\n00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.220\nyears, I see the benefit of that,\nbecause it allows it to go\n\n426\n00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.180\nbeyond the idea of me going,\nas long as I have PowerPoint, I'm good.\n\n427\n00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.410\nI now know that that presentation can\nactually affect many more people,\n\n428\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.035\neven if they don't have\nPowerPoint available.\n\n429\n00:24:46.035 --> 00:24:46.990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n430\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:51.060\nSo now we're talking about the experience\nof making the presentation.\n\n431\n00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.810\nNow the very fact that you\ncan type things out and\n\n432\n00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:59.270\npaste them here doesn't necessarily\nmean you will have a great presentation.\n\n433\n00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.970\nYou also have to prepare\nyourself to present and\n\n434\n00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:06.090\nsome of the guidelines that we can\ngive in preparing presentations.\n\n435\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.730\nOne, don't put too much text.\n\n436\n00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.410\nWhen you're having a presentation\nto enlarge your dias, for example,\n\n437\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.920\npeople really don't have the time to read,\nthey want to listen to you.\n\n438\n00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.280\nThey want to hear the story, so\nthe presentation becomes a guide.\n\n439\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.110\nIf you want to put\nthings in bullet points,\n\n440\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:27.470\nthat can be very helpful as opposing\nto putting them in paragraph form.\n\n441\n00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.310\nOtherwise, people are tempted to start\nreading and if they're going to read,\n\n442\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:34.360\nthen you may as well have given them\nthe book so they can go and read.\n\n443\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.780\nThey are relying on you to make a summary,\nto make key highlights.\n\n444\n00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.310\nThink about your own audience, especially\nwhen you're having a lot of text.\n\n445\n00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:48.450\nHow do you organize it so that the focus\ndoes not go into reading the presentation\n\n446\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.974\nand trying to figure out what's\nthe connection between different things,\n\n447\n00:25:51.974 --> 00:25:53.760\nso they can spend more\ntime listening to you.\n\n448\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.390\nIf they must turn their head\ngo look at the presentation,\n\n449\n00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.570\nthey can see the key bullet points and\nthen you tell the story.\n\n450\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.560\nThe other thing I think you should\nthink about is not too many colors.\n\n451\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.850\nYou see the opportunity to\ndo colors here is there.\n\n452\n00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.780\nThe space is there,\nyou can explore your creativity.\n\n453\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.445\nBut the way the human mind\nprocesses information is\n\n454\n00:26:14.445 --> 00:26:19.325\nwe have to moderate how much color you do,\nespecially if you're doing it for adults.\n\n455\n00:26:19.325 --> 00:26:23.645\nFor children, I think color is of\ninterest and sound is of interest, and\n\n456\n00:26:23.645 --> 00:26:26.805\nyou can play with a lot of colors and\nthat's okay.\n\n457\n00:26:26.805 --> 00:26:31.085\nBut for grownups, I think you want\nto minimize the number of colors and\n\n458\n00:26:31.085 --> 00:26:34.750\nthen how related are those\ncolors as you put them together.\n\n459\n00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:41.070\nAlso, if you're gonna make this\npresentation to somebody, you\n\n460\n00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:46.670\nknow that the audience is looking at the\nscreen, they're looking at the projection.\n\n461\n00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:51.415\nNow you also want to make sure\nyou look at the audience.\n\n462\n00:26:51.415 --> 00:26:53.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because you can [LAUGH] make\n\n463\n00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.640\na presentation and\nyou find yourself turning and\n\n464\n00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.090\nreading what's on the presentation and so\nyou're giving your audience your back.\n\n465\n00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.610\nIdeally, that's not a good way to present.\n\n466\n00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.630\nYou want to try as much as possible,\n\n467\n00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.690\nunderstand the material and\nuse this to present and\n\n468\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:19.150\nsummarize, and show relationship,\nand put life into the presentation.\n\n469\n00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:24.990\nSo that it's not, you are reading one line\nat a time and trying to demonstrate that\n\n470\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:29.840\nyou know what's written up there.\n\n471\n00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.250\nNo, you don't even have to read all\nthe words up there, because your audience\n\n472\n00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:41.120\ncan read that presentation, so you can\nfocus on explaining the story behind it,\n\n473\n00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.400\nthe material behind it,\nthe logic behind it, and things like that.\n\n474\n00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.310\nI think there are many other things\nwe can talk about, but one more thing\n\n475\n00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.830\nthat I think I want to emphasize on making\npresentations is time is important.\n\n476\n00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:55.860\nIn most cases,\n\n477\n00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.020\nwhen we're given an opportunity to make a\npresentation, the time will be predefined.\n\n478\n00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.180\nYou'll probably have seven minutes,\nfive minutes, or whatever it may be.\n\n479\n00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.990\nYou want to think about the key messages\nthat you want to pass during that\n\n480\n00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.180\nperiod of time.\n\n481\n00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:15.010\nAnd experiences, as we've done these\npresentations before, every time you\n\n482\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:20.770\ngo beyond the time allocated, your\naudience starts becoming uncomfortable.\n\n483\n00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.250\nEven the moderator, in such a case,\ndoesn't get an easy, and\n\n484\n00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:30.798\nthen the focus shifts from the actual\npresentation into the time mismanagement.\n\n485\n00:28:30.798 --> 00:28:36.810\nThen people even begin to focus on\nsomething else that is negative,\n\n486\n00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.250\nyet you've already done a very\nbeautiful presentation.\n\n487\n00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:43.820\nIt's always a good habit to finish\nyour presentations on time and\n\n488\n00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.280\nensure that people can remember.\n\n489\n00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.190\nPeople value time, I mean,\ntime is so valuable.\n\n490\n00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:53.790\nYou don't want to feel like you\nare overusing people's time when they\n\n491\n00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.560\ncould have done something else or\n\n492\n00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.540\nyou're using someone else's time who\nshould have done a presentation.\n\n493\n00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.890\nSo manage yourself within the time.\n\n494\n00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.270\nThat means,\nwhatever number of slides you have,\n\n495\n00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.040\nmake sure you've thought about\nhow much time will you need for\n\n496\n00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.290\neach of those slides, so that you're able\nto finish within the time allocated.\n\n497\n00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.090\nAs it is right now,\nour time is coming up and so\n\n498\n00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.630\nwe also can't go on with presentations.\n\n499\n00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:20.380\nI guess my colleague here may have\nsome final comments as we close.\n\n500\n00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.340\n>> All of everything that Dr.\nsays is pretty much the key.\n\n501\n00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.360\nUse it as an enhancement to the point\nthat you're trying to make.\n\n502\n00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.440\nDo not make the PowerPoint\npresentation itself\n\n503\n00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.430\nthe central point that\nactually is to be made here.\n\n504\n00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:39.180\nWhen you do that, again, you're actually\nincreasing your skills as a presenter and\n\n505\n00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.760\nhopefully, also increasing your\nconfidence as a presenter as well.\n\n506\n00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.720\nBeing able to do that is the difference\nbetween somebody that really knows their\n\n507\n00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.150\nmaterial well and\nsomebody that just created a PowerPoint.\n\n508\n00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.890\nWhat we want to be known as, of course,\n\n509\n00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.770\nis the person that can\ncreate the PowerPoint, but\n\n510\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.610\nalso be able to present the information,\nand that is our task and our duty.\n\n511\n00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.280\nSometimes it may just fall on to us to\njust create what somebody else gave us.\n\n512\n00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.720\nThat's perfectly fine, but it may fall\nto you when they say, what else can I\n\n513\n00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:11.060\nadd in here to add that spark that I need\nor to add that emphasis that I need?\n\n514\n00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.160\nYou're the person that's going to need\nto know how to do that and hopefully,\n\n515\n00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.960\nwhat you've seen here, of course,\nduring these episodes is understanding,\n\n516\n00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.260\nhere's some key elements we can\ndo to help us to do that, and\n\n517\n00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.384\nto help us to make the point\nthat needs to be made.\n\n518\n00:30:24.384 --> 00:30:28.440\nDr. thank you again for helping us to\nunderstand Microsoft PowerPoint and\n\n519\n00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.935\ngetting started with it, and\nthank you also for watching, but\n\n520\n00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:35.035\nthat's a great place for\nus to end this episode as well.\n\n521\n00:30:35.035 --> 00:30:38.835\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n522\n00:30:38.835 --> 00:30:42.357\n>> And my name is Dr.\nTony learning together.\n\n523\n00:30:42.357 -->

00:00:16.624\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:20.631\nAnd you're watching the Computing\nFundamentals IC3 show where we are now\n\n5\n00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:24.258\ntaking a look into the world of\nnetworking and networking basics and\n\n6\n00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.900\nlearning a little bit more about that.\n\n7\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.926\nAnd here to help us out to understand\na little bit more is gonna\n\n8\n00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.335\nbe Dr Tonny Omwansa.\n\n9\n00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:33.080\nDr Tonny, welcome back to our studios.\n\n10\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.080\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n11\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.086\nIt's great always being here and learning\ntogether on the fundamentals of computing.\n\n12\n00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:42.880\n>> All right, so Doctor Tonny, if I am\njust working with an individual computer\n\n13\n00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.807\nby itself, that should be all I\nneed to be able to access and do.\n\n14\n00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:51.130\nWhy is it so important that I know\na little bit about networking?\n\n15\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.400\n>> It's a very, very,\nvery important question.\n\n16\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.540\nLook, we spend a lot of time\ntalking about computer.\n\n17\n00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.700\nWe've talked about hardware,\nwe've talked about software and somehow,\n\n18\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.150\nyou can actually get to do\nwhat you need to do with\n\n19\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.747\njust a computer that is not\nconnected to any other.\n\n20\n00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:09.270\nBut in reality,\nwe need to work with others.\n\n21\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.470\nAnd the beauty about computers is they've\nnow been developed to enable us to\n\n22\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.550\ncommunicate with other people,\nsend documents across wide geographical\n\n23\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.360\nareas in a matter of seconds,\nchat with other people, send emails.\n\n24\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.560\nSo it's gonna be necessary for us to\nappreciate how do computers communicate\n\n25\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.669\nacross and how do we possibly\nuse some of those features.\n\n26\n00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:31.549\n>> All right, so Dr.\n\n27\n00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.571\nOmwansa, if we're just really beginning\nthis after understanding just the basics,\n\n28\n00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:38.782\nwhere is our starting point when\nwe start talking about networking?\n\n29\n00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:42.097\nCuz it seems like I really may\nnot have actually used a computer\n\n30\n00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:44.540\nnetwork before and\nnow I need to get started.\n\n31\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.990\nIs there a lot of technicality\nthat I need to go into?\n\n32\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.010\n>> Well, yes and no, depends on the depth\nyou really want to go into this.\n\n33\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.216\nFor purposes of introduction,\nwe're gonna appreciate a few things.\n\n34\n00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:59.920\nOne is how does communication\nreally take place and\n\n35\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.770\nhow do the computers borrow\nfrom real life communication?\n\n36\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.150\nYou and I are talking right now, yeah?\n\n37\n00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.690\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n38\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.110\nso I hope that computers\nwould talk like that, right?\n\n39\n00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.250\n>> Hopefully, all right,\n\n40\n00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.440\nthen we'll try to distinguish\nthe various types of computer networks.\n\n41\n00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.730\nWe'll think about the hardware devices\nthat enable computers to communicate.\n\n42\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.930\nThen we'll try to figure\nout what do you choose,\n\n43\n00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.770\nwhich kind of communication\ntechnique do you choose?\n\n44\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.470\nAnd finally,\nwe'll try to appreciate the Internet,\n\n45\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.910\nthe power of Internet connectivity,\nbefore we go into troubleshooting.\n\n46\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.080\n>> It sounds like a great idea.\n\n47\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.240\nSo when we start talking\nabout the idea of networking,\n\n48\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.070\nmost of us don't seem to believe that\nwe might have used a network before.\n\n49\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.880\nBut you probably have, at least, if you've\nactually picked up a telephone before and\n\n50\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.190\ncalled somebody else.\n\n51\n00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.670\nYou're not using your own network,\n\n52\n00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.830\nbut you're actually using that\ntelephone company's network as well.\n\n53\n00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.000\nAnd so a lot of times we can get\nestablished in our regular daily lives by\n\n54\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.230\ntaking a look at those examples,\nright, Dr. Tonny?\n\n55\n00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.070\nThat's correct.\n\n56\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.990\nI mean, we've made a phone call before,\nprobably, probably not, but\n\n57\n00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.896\nthat's a very common technology\nthat has been around.\n\n58\n00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.990\nThe computer communication kind of\nborders a little bit from that concept.\n\n59\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.890\nBut the difference is that it uses\nwhat we call packet suite to network.\n\n60\n00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.700\nIn a sense,\nthe data tends to move in form of packets.\n\n61\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.380\nSo it's converted, we'll not go\ninto a lot of technical details but\n\n62\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.500\nat least, you'll appreciate\nthat data moves in packets and\n\n63\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.130\npackets of data seem to have a sense\nof a source and a destination address.\n\n64\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.510\nWhich means if you have so\n\n65\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.480\nmany computers connected, whenever\na packet is going to leave a computer,\n\n66\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.680\nit needs to know where it's going to go,\notherwise it's huge mesh of network.\n\n67\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.460\nAll right, so\nthat forms a foundation in thinking about\n\n68\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.760\nwhat is the philosophy of\ncommunication of computer networks.\n\n69\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.686\n>> So when we start seeing\nthat idea of interconnection,\n\n70\n00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:44.975\nthat idea the telephone call, of course,\n\n71\n00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:48.979\nis kind of the first link that we have\nwhere we might dial from one computer or\n\n72\n00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:53.463\nfrom one telephone handset to another one\nwhich gives us a source and destination.\n\n73\n00:03:53.463 --> 00:03:56.605\nBut when we are connected to\na network by itself, there\n\n74\n00:03:56.605 --> 00:04:01.544\nmay be many destinations that are possible\nand they're all using that same network.\n\n75\n00:04:01.544 --> 00:04:05.907\nAnd so instead what we rely on is that\npacket switch network that Dr Tonny was\n\n76\n00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:09.924\ntalking about that allows us to be\nable to move from different types of\n\n77\n00:04:09.924 --> 00:04:14.370\nnodes to its ultimate destination\nthat it needs to be able to go to.\n\n78\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.040\nSo in that type of network,\nit doesn't matter where it travels,\n\n79\n00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.030\nas long as it actually\ngets to the other end.\n\n80\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.886\nWhereas, in a telephone call,\n\n81\n00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:25.508\nyou're really only taking one path to be\nable to get from there to the other end.\n\n82\n00:04:25.508 --> 00:04:28.126\nNow Dr. Tonny,\nwhat about the idea of the Internet?\n\n83\n00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:30.550\nWhat is that concept really all about and\n\n84\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.970\nwhy is it important to me if I'm\nworking in the business world?\n\n85\n00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.540\n>> All right, that's a great question.\n\n86\n00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.180\nLet's start, let me think about it.\n\n87\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.730\nDo you have one computer?\n\n88\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.020\nIt can be connected to two,\n\n89\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.780\nthree other computers that creates\na small network, all right.\n\n90\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.720\nNow it is now possible to have all\ncomputers across the world be connected.\n\n91\n00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.410\nThey may not all be connected at one point\nin time but that possibility exists.\n\n92\n00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.040\nSo the Internet is really\nthe largest computer network that\n\n93\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.430\nwe have which is\na collection of computers.\n\n94\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.306\nAnd not only computers, but there\nare other devices also connected in there,\n\n95\n00:05:04.306 --> 00:05:08.066\nwhich therefore means you have the power\nto communicate with a computer that\n\n96\n00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:09.790\nis far, far, far away out there.\n\n97\n00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.370\nSomewhere you can't even imagine.\n\n98\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.500\nYou don't even need to know\nthe physical location.\n\n99\n00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.140\nIt's possible to communicate.\n\n100\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.670\nNow that communication is gonna\nonly happen as a result of some\n\n101\n00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.136\nset of rules that have been created to\ngovern how communication is gonna happen.\n\n102\n00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:26.350\nYou just don't wake up and just call,\nI wanna talk to that computer.\n\n103\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.540\nNot necessarily.\n\n104\n00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.230\nThere are certain rules and\nthey're called protocols.\n\n105\n00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.620\nAnd there are many protocols.\n\n106\n00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.760\nThere is an opportunity to immerse\nourselves into protocols but\n\n107\n00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.100\nthere's a set of rules that govern\nhow communication takes place.\n\n108\n00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.990\nAnd there you go.\n\n109\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.510\nMaybe you wanna talk about one protocol?\n\n110\n00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.170\n>> Sure, when we start taking a look\nat the idea of the Internet, the basic\n\n111\n00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.328\nprotocol that actually underlies the\nInternet is the one that's called TCP/IP.\n\n112\n00:05:52.328 --> 00:05:56.199\nAnd it is just that set of rules that\nif you're gonna use that network, for\n\n113\n00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.822\nthose devices that\nare directly connected to it,\n\n114\n00:05:58.822 --> 00:06:02.962\nevery single device needs to able to at\nleast talk in those types of protocols.\n\n115\n00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:05.515\nIf they do not,\nthey won't be able to communicate.\n\n116\n00:06:05.515 --> 00:06:09.636\nSo underlying all the physical\ntechnology that keeps us connected is\n\n117\n00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:13.900\na software technology that allows\nus to be able to communicate.\n\n118\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.554\nAnd so every node that's connected to\nthe Internet speaks that language or\n\n119\n00:06:17.554 --> 00:06:21.040\nuses that protocol, or\nit wouldn't be able to communicate.\n\n120\n00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.340\nSo that is one of the important features\nbecause a lot of companies are directly\n\n121\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.940\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n122\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.721\nIt also means, of course, then we might\nhave to be able to connect to that,\n\n123\n00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:35.470\nto actually get access maybe\nto a customer resource or\n\n124\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.900\nto buy something or\nto send information across that,\n\n125\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.750\nbecause I don't have a network built\nbetween me and whoever that is.\n\n126\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.770\nBut when I hear about\nthe idea of the Internet,\n\n127\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.740\nwe know these are multiple\ncompanies that are connected.\n\n128\n00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.400\nBut there's also what we call\nprivate networks too, right?\n\n129\n00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.210\n>> That's correct.\n\n130\n00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.910\nWe've got actually different types of\n\n131\n00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.040\nability to communicate\nbetween computer networks.\n\n132\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.362\nWe've got private networks which\nare secure because Internet is not\n\n133\n00:07:02.362 --> 00:07:03.455\nnecessarily secure.\n\n134\n00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:07.817\nSo if you really want to operate in\na secure environment whenever you transmit\n\n135\n00:07:07.817 --> 00:07:12.393\ndata, you're sure that it can't be\nintercepted., we use private networks.\n\n136\n00:07:12.393 --> 00:07:17.136\nThen we've got satellite technology\nthat enables computers to\n\n137\n00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:20.220\ncommunicate from a remote location.\n\n138\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.360\nWe've got a cellular network, you probably\nknow about a company that provides\n\n139\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.950\nthat kind of connectivity for\ncellular cellphones.\n\n140\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.720\nAnd then even using that\ncellular technology,\n\n141\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.590\nit is possible to connect to your\ncomputer using tethering technology and\n\n142\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.480\nthen it enables computers to communicate.\n\n143\n00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.792\nSo all those options exist and as you\ninteract with computers depending on where\n\n144\n00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:46.779\nyou are based, you might, and\ndepending on what need you actually have,\n\n145\n00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:49.860\nyou might end up using\na virtual private network.\n\n146\n00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.190\nOr you might end up using\nsatellite technology.\n\n147\n00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.860\nOr cellular technology.\n\n148\n00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.681\n>> Yeah.\nIn terms of accessing networks, right.\n\n149\n00:07:56.681 --> 00:08:01.932\nThe idea of satellite networks really help\nwhen you do not have a physical line.\n\n150\n00:08:01.932 --> 00:08:06.141\nThat brings you that connectivity for\nyour internet connection.\n\n151\n00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:09.929\nSo instead they set up a nice little\nsatellite dish in your yard, and\n\n152\n00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:11.927\nyou have a receiver box at your end.\n\n153\n00:08:11.927 --> 00:08:15.440\nAnd it shoots a signal up\ninto a satellite in the sky.\n\n154\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.701\nAnd then you are connected\nusing that form of technology.\n\n155\n00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:22.242\nAnd of course the idea of private\nnetworks have always existed.\n\n156\n00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:26.948\nBeside the idea of the Internet, we can\nactually go to those companies and say,\n\n157\n00:08:26.948 --> 00:08:31.035\nI need to establish a private direct\nconnection to another company.\n\n158\n00:08:31.035 --> 00:08:35.865\nOr even to, let's say, my branch office\nthat exist in some other location inside\n\n159\n00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:38.397\nof the city or\nmaybe inside of the country.\n\n160\n00:08:38.397 --> 00:08:42.319\nAnd they can go ahead and run that as\na private line for us, so that our traffic\n\n161\n00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:45.832\nis not directly intermingled on\nthe Internet with everybody else.\n\n162\n00:08:45.832 --> 00:08:48.220\nBut we also have this technology for us.\n\n163\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.099\nSo there's a few different ways\nthat we can access the Internet\n\n164\n00:08:51.099 --> 00:08:53.012\nby using these different technologies.\n\n165\n00:08:53.012 --> 00:08:57.032\nDepending on our location, depending\non our need at the moment, whether it's\n\n166\n00:08:57.032 --> 00:09:00.634\nsecurity, or if we just need access\nto a lot of information at one time.\n\n167\n00:09:00.634 --> 00:09:03.102\nWe can directly connect\nto the Internet as well.\n\n168\n00:09:03.102 --> 00:09:06.536\nNow, Dr. Tani,\nwhen we start talking about just networks,\n\n169\n00:09:06.536 --> 00:09:10.103\nwe also tend to classify network\nby the idea of different ways and\n\n170\n00:09:10.103 --> 00:09:13.340\nusually it's about location\nmore than anything else.\n\n171\n00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.490\n>> Absolutely, right now on my computer,\n\n172\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.830\nI have actually displayed an image that\nwill illustrate what I'm talking about.\n\n173\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.800\nYou know, computer networks,\nit's a question of the sizes and\n\n174\n00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.008\nwhere are they located.\n\n175\n00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:30.110\nSo the first image I have here on\nthe extreme left is written PAN.\n\n176\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.000\nWe call it a private area network or\n\n177\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.260\npersonal area network depending on\nwhat term people are familiar with.\n\n178\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.360\nIf you're at home, you can connect some\ntwo, three computers or whatever number,\n\n179\n00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.830\nlittle number,\nyou can put in a printer over there and\n\n180\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.970\nyou can be able to print something.\n\n181\n00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.720\nYou may have a scanner, you may have\na camera, and you create a small network\n\n182\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.130\nthat a few of you can use and\nthat's small geographical area.\n\n183\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.009\nThen over here next to it we've got\na much, slightly larger network,\n\n184\n00:09:57.009 --> 00:09:59.002\nwhich we call a Local Area Network.\n\n185\n00:09:59.002 --> 00:10:02.152\nSo, if we are in an office and\nwe are sharing resources and\n\n186\n00:10:02.152 --> 00:10:06.560\nwe've got maybe three, four other rooms\nout there and they are all connected.\n\n187\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.278\nAnd all these computers are connected,\nyou can see some device right in there,\n\n188\n00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:14.370\nwe'll come to some of the devices that\nenable us to connect switches and routers.\n\n189\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.460\nWe'll get to that, but now you have\nan opportunity to interact between\n\n190\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.210\nfew five computers in few different rooms.\n\n191\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.950\nWe also have wide area networks,\n\n192\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:28.100\nout here is a wide area network which\nmeans it's a collection of possibly,\n\n193\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.530\npersonal networks, local area network,\nand much larger networks.\n\n194\n00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.050\nIt means it could be as much as a city,\n\n195\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:41.380\nit could possibly be a wide region,\nand thus becomes a wide area network.\n\n196\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.650\nNow we've got some which are a little\nmore specific depending on where exactly\n\n197\n00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.680\nyou're referring to.\n\n198\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.070\nSo we've got metropolitan area\nnetwork that we can refer to a city\n\n199\n00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.220\nfor that matter.\n\n200\n00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.570\nSo geography helps us\nto classify a network.\n\n201\n00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.080\nSo that way you get a sense of,\nwhere could this computer be located and\n\n202\n00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.050\nwhat would I possibly do with\nthat particular computer.\n\n203\n00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.335\n>> Yeah those classifications\ntend to be very generalized and\n\n204\n00:11:05.335 --> 00:11:06.916\nused throughout the world.\n\n205\n00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:11.247\nSo understanding that when you do see that\nindividual maybe connected to a printer or\n\n206\n00:11:11.247 --> 00:11:15.281\nmaybe even just to a scanner, that is\nthat personal area that we talked about.\n\n207\n00:11:15.281 --> 00:11:19.513\nInside most office buildings where you'll\nend up working with a computer system,\n\n208\n00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:22.121\nis probably connected to\nthat local area network.\n\n209\n00:11:22.121 --> 00:11:25.452\nAnd then if that office\nalso has another location,\n\n210\n00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:29.722\nlet's say in another part of a city\nthat you tend to be working in.\n\n211\n00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:33.670\nOr even in another part of the country\nthat you might be working, or\n\n212\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.509\neven across the entire world.\n\n213\n00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:39.396\nYou might find out that you're actually\nalso a part of a wide area network as well\n\n214\n00:11:39.396 --> 00:11:42.268\nthat connects those networks together for\nus.\n\n215\n00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:45.701\nNow Dr. Tani, that's not the only\nclassification that we have, but\n\n216\n00:11:45.701 --> 00:11:48.855\nlet's talk specifically about\nthe local area network itself.\n\n217\n00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:51.903\nAnd those two classifications\nthat we can talk on, and\n\n218\n00:11:51.903 --> 00:11:56.620\nI think they're called peer to peer, and\nserver client or client server networks.\n\n219\n00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.127\n>> Yeah,\nas the name suggests peer to peer.\n\n220\n00:12:00.127 --> 00:12:02.790\nIt looks like you and I are equal and\nwe're somehow connected.\n\n221\n00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.177\nAnd so we've got some technology that\nenables the two of us to connect as\n\n222\n00:12:06.177 --> 00:12:06.863\npeer to peer.\n\n223\n00:12:06.863 --> 00:12:10.823\nAnd we can easily send\nfiles between computers.\n\n224\n00:12:10.823 --> 00:12:14.670\nWe can capitalize on some resources that\nare available in different computers.\n\n225\n00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.400\nLet's assume I have\nOffice in my computer and\n\n226\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.310\nsomeone else has some other useful\napplication that we can collaborate.\n\n227\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.801\nI can connect to that computer,\nthey can connect to this computer and\n\n228\n00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:27.676\nget to use the resources on this end.\n\n229\n00:12:27.676 --> 00:12:29.936\nThat's a power of peer to peer.\n\n230\n00:12:29.936 --> 00:12:32.660\nBut then we also have clients\nwho have a kind of connection.\n\n231\n00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.210\nNow think about it,\n\n232\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.860\nassuming I've got a Sava which is a much\nmore sophisticated kind of computer.\n\n233\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.196\nProbably has a lot more storage,\nhas more RAM,\n\n234\n00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:45.785\nhas much more processing capacity, etc.\n\n235\n00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:51.270\nAnd we need to connect in order to\nutilize some resources over there.\n\n236\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.150\nSo several of us can actually connect\nto that particular computer and\n\n237\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.070\nthen we can utilize those resources.\n\n238\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.302\nSo the applications can possibly run, or\n\n239\n00:12:59.302 --> 00:13:03.661\nthe files will actually be stored in that\ncomputer and then we connect this side.\n\n240\n00:13:03.661 --> 00:13:07.631\nSo maybe at some point in time you've\nheard of the term thin client,\n\n241\n00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:11.755\nwhich means there is less processing\ntaking place at the client side.\n\n242\n00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:14.408\nAnd there's a lot more\nprocessing that is taking,\n\n243\n00:13:14.408 --> 00:13:16.762\na lot of work is happening\nat the server side.\n\n244\n00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:21.681\nSo there comes the client's side\nrelationship where the clients\n\n245\n00:13:21.681 --> 00:13:25.650\nare basically making\nrequests to the server.\n\n246\n00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.618\nAnd the server pushes whatever\nthe customer sends to the client.\n\n247\n00:13:29.618 --> 00:13:33.193\n>> Whenever you start seeing these\ntwo types of classifications inside\n\n248\n00:13:33.193 --> 00:13:37.443\nof the local area network, normally it's\nreally about the size of the network and\n\n249\n00:13:37.443 --> 00:13:39.733\nthe resources that they\ncan gain access to.\n\n250\n00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:42.734\nA small office may just have\na peer to peer network where\n\n251\n00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:45.223\nthey might share a common\nprinter together.\n\n252\n00:13:45.223 --> 00:13:48.903\nBut each one acts as\nan individual computer by itself,\n\n253\n00:13:48.903 --> 00:13:53.872\nnot really needing any additional\nresources except maybe that printer.\n\n254\n00:13:53.872 --> 00:13:57.270\nAnd this also means that administratively\nthey function on their own and\n\n255\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.760\nthey're really own connectivity is the\nonly thing that they're really sharing.\n\n256\n00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.972\nIn that server network as Dr.\n\n257\n00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:06.610\nOmwanza talked about, the server client or\nclient server, I always call it backwards.\n\n258\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.993\nThis client server network Usually there\nare resources that are available on what\n\n259\n00:14:10.993 --> 00:14:12.401\nwe call a server machine.\n\n260\n00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:14.139\nThat allows for the connection,\n\n261\n00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:17.304\nof not just one or two clients but\nmaybe multiple clients over\n\n262\n00:14:17.304 --> 00:14:21.544\nmultiple geographical locations that can\naccess the resources on that server.\n\n263\n00:14:21.544 --> 00:14:25.865\nAnd so we are no longer just dependent for\nconnectivity but we also have of course\n\n264\n00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:30.141\nneeds out there, application services\nthat may be running on those servers.\n\n265\n00:14:30.141 --> 00:14:33.001\nSo it allows us to connect to\nthose machines as individual\n\n266\n00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:34.650\nwork stations as well.\n\n267\n00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.860\nSo you will probably end up seeing\nmore often inside of businesses\n\n268\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.130\nthat type of client server network,\nbecause it is scalable.\n\n269\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.160\nIt allows for that company to\ncontinue to grow without needing to\n\n270\n00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.600\nchange the infrastructure.\n\n271\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.780\nIn a peer to peer network, after a while\nyou'll have to change the infrastructure,\n\n272\n00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.860\nbecause there'll be too much\ntraffic on that network.\n\n273\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.199\nDoctor Tani we can also talk though, about\nsome of the resources and how we gain\n\n274\n00:14:57.199 --> 00:15:01.212\naccess to them when we also talk about\nthe classification of Internet and\n\n275\n00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:02.293\nextranet as well.\n\n276\n00:15:02.293 --> 00:15:03.862\n>> Yes, no think about it.\n\n277\n00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:06.040\nWe talk about local area networks, but\n\n278\n00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.726\nthat doesn't necessarily mean that you\nknow other people can't access those local\n\n279\n00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:15.300\narea networks if they they can develop\na mechanism to connect from outside.\n\n280\n00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.086\nSo sometimes we create Intranet for\npurposes of controlling as to who can\n\n281\n00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:24.567\nactually access those particular\nresources within that network.\n\n282\n00:15:24.567 --> 00:15:28.644\nSo in organizations, businesses\ntend to establish an intranet so\n\n283\n00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:32.503\nthat employees within the organization or\nstudents or staff,\n\n284\n00:15:32.503 --> 00:15:37.404\ncan access those resources as long as\nthey are within that particular network.\n\n285\n00:15:37.404 --> 00:15:42.347\nBut otherwise, you may also want to\ncreate something a little secure for\n\n286\n00:15:42.347 --> 00:15:46.575\nyour customers, your partners,\nfor your suppliers, etc.\n\n287\n00:15:46.575 --> 00:15:53.529\nAnd there now is a need to create\nsomething a little more extended.\n\n288\n00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:58.184\nSo the extranet then comes in and\nyou create some kind of a secure network\n\n289\n00:15:58.184 --> 00:16:02.373\nThat enables people who have\nan interest in what you're doing or\n\n290\n00:16:02.373 --> 00:16:06.968\nyou have relationship with for\nthem to securely access that network.\n\n291\n00:16:06.968 --> 00:16:08.192\n>> All right, so Dr.\n\n292\n00:16:08.192 --> 00:16:12.562\nTonny, now that we understand some\nof the basic categorizations.\n\n293\n00:16:12.562 --> 00:16:17.430\nI'm not gonna be able to say those words\nhere, basic categorizations of networking.\n\n294\n00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.430\nWe wanna talk about the access\ntechnologies just a little bit.\n\n295\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.840\nThe underlying technology that we\ntend to use in networking today\n\n296\n00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.010\nreally stems off of one particular\ntechnology that we call ethernet.\n\n297\n00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.980\nAnd so that is the underlying technology\nthat allows for us to pick the proper\n\n298\n00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:38.470\ncabling, the devices that we normally also\nrun to connect those things together.\n\n299\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.690\nAnd of course, what the language is,\n\n300\n00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.670\nthat's everything that's translated\nas it gets put on the wire.\n\n301\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.080\nSo Dr. Tonny,\nwhen we start looking a look at that,\n\n302\n00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.060\nwe really can categorize it into wired and\nwireless types of networks, right?\n\n303\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:50.900\n>> That's correct.\n\n304\n00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.070\nIt doesn't mean that\nevery time that you're\n\n305\n00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.650\nconnecting to a computer you must\nphysically put in some wire out there.\n\n306\n00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.190\nAnd then make sure that\nthe communication happens.\n\n307\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.810\nTechnology has evolved, yes, you can do\na wired connection and then therefore,\n\n308\n00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.860\nsend something to a printer or\nsend something to another computer.\n\n309\n00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.010\nBut then there's also\nthe option of wireless.\n\n310\n00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.720\nThe standard or the concepts behind or\nthe protocol for\n\n311\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.950\nthat matter is relatively similar.\n\n312\n00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:21.884\nBut then the manifestation of that\ntechnology has been improved over time.\n\n313\n00:17:21.884 --> 00:17:27.400\nAnd we've got those options for\ndirect connection and wireless connection.\n\n314\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.300\nAnd within the wireless connection,\nnot only do we talk about Wi-Fi.\n\n315\n00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.020\nYou'll have to really help me.\n\n316\n00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.552\n>> Okay.\n>> Why was it ever called Wi-Fi?\n\n317\n00:17:35.552 --> 00:17:36.092\n>> Yeah.\n\n318\n00:17:36.092 --> 00:17:40.830\nWell, Wi-Fi or the idea of wireless here\nis that there is an alliance of these\n\n319\n00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.100\nhardware manufactures that chose\nto develop this technology.\n\n320\n00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.200\nAnd instead of them competing with\neach other, they realized that for\n\n321\n00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.040\nthe betterment of that type\nof networking technology.\n\n322\n00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.720\nAnd for everybody that this particular\nmarket space was very big and\n\n323\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.930\nallowed them to say look,\nwe can standardize everything.\n\n324\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.710\nAnd we can still make money off of it,\n\n325\n00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.940\nregardless of how many\ncompanies that are out there.\n\n326\n00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.650\nSo they chose to actually say,\n\n327\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.990\nhere in the wireless range of things, this\nis how we are going to standardize it.\n\n328\n00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.948\nAnd so those groups of companies\nthat came together, Dr.\n\n329\n00:18:09.948 --> 00:18:13.800\nTonny, said, let's form what\nwe'll call the Wi-Fi Alliance.\n\n330\n00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.070\nAnd that's what Wi-Fi is\nactually named after,\n\n331\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.640\nis this alliance that they've\nactually come up with.\n\n332\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.360\nAnd so now the standardization for\n\n333\n00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.750\nwireless technologies that we connect\nour computers to, our smartphones to.\n\n334\n00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.730\nAll that is coming underneath\nthat idea of Wi-Fi.\n\n335\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.457\n>> Great, well I wasn't there [LAUGH].\n\n336\n00:18:30.457 --> 00:18:32.141\n>> [LAUGH] Neither was I.\n\n337\n00:18:32.141 --> 00:18:33.140\n>> [LAUGH] Really?\n\n338\n00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.150\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n339\n00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.680\n>> Yeah, si in addition to Wi-Fi,\n\n340\n00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.280\nwe've got other wireless\nforms of communication.\n\n341\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.750\nWe've got bluetooth that enables\ntwo devices to communicate or\n\n342\n00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.560\nmore than two devices to communicate\nwithin a very short range of distance.\n\n343\n00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.740\nThese are the options out there,\nthey may not be as common as the others.\n\n344\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:19:00.565\nThings like infrared, microwave and at one\npoint in time, you do get to utilize them.\n\n345\n00:19:00.565 --> 00:19:04.855\nAll depends on the kind of\nfunctionality that you're exploring or\n\n346\n00:19:04.855 --> 00:19:08.175\nwhere geographically you are or\nwho the supplier is.\n\n347\n00:19:08.175 --> 00:19:09.750\nAll the needs out there.\n\n348\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.927\nSo all those options exist and I want to\nbelieve that those are technologies that\n\n349\n00:19:13.927 --> 00:19:17.482\nif you want to immerse yourself\nin understanding the capability's\n\n350\n00:19:17.482 --> 00:19:20.121\nright there,\nthere is your opportunity to do it.\n\n351\n00:19:20.121 --> 00:19:23.460\n>> Now Dr. Omwanza, the interesting\nstory is really about bluetooth.\n\n352\n00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.440\nThe bluetooth is actually\nnamed after a guy that ate so\n\n353\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.810\nmany blueberries that it\nstained his teeth blue.\n\n354\n00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.890\nBelieve it or not,\nthat's what it was actually named after.\n\n355\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.160\nYeah, it is kind of very\ninteresting in that sense.\n\n356\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.650\nBut he developed a communication\ntechnology between different countries\n\n357\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.760\nthat's said for commerce,\nwe're gonna use one language.\n\n358\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.490\nAnd so instead of them trying\nto argue over what language\n\n359\n00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.920\nwas understood when\nthey made an agreement.\n\n360\n00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.110\nThey just said,\nthis is how we're gonna standardize it.\n\n361\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.810\nAnd bluetooth was actually named in\nhonor of him to standardize that.\n\n362\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.420\nBluetooth technology allows me\njust to turn a button on and\n\n363\n00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.240\nthen you turn a button on and\nwe don't have to figure out how it works.\n\n364\n00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.170\nIt just says, I know what that standard is\nand I'll communicate and lock it in and\n\n365\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:08.860\nbe able to communicate.\n\n366\n00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.770\nSo that's a very interesting technology.\n\n367\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.450\n>> Sounds great.\n\n368\n00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.970\nAlso when I grow up, I think\nsomething is gonna be named after me.\n\n369\n00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.082\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Now let's talk about physical\n\n370\n00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:19.370\nconnection between devices.\n\n371\n00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:23.789\nAnd the last I checked is that you\nreally have some strength in physics and\n\n372\n00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:28.135\nyou could easily talk a lot about\nnetwork adapters and the interface for\n\n373\n00:20:28.135 --> 00:20:29.165\nconnectivity.\n\n374\n00:20:29.165 --> 00:20:33.285\nCould you just give a little bit of\nthe physics behind that connectivity of\n\n375\n00:20:33.285 --> 00:20:33.970\nadapters?\n\n376\n00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:34.470\n>> Sure.\n\n377\n00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.110\nWhen we start taking a look at\nthe idea of physical connection,\n\n378\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.940\nright, well how do we get\nconnected to a network?\n\n379\n00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.870\nWell, we normally have a port\non the side of the computer or\n\n380\n00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.810\nactually that port is connected to\na device that's called a network adapter.\n\n381\n00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.910\nIt allows that computer to\ncommunicate on that network.\n\n382\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.370\nNow that can actually be a physical\nport in which there's a jack and\n\n383\n00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.680\nyou can take a cable and plug it in.\n\n384\n00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.388\nLet me show you an example\nof a cable here.\n\n385\n00:20:57.388 --> 00:21:01.830\nA cable that actually fits\ndirectly into that jack and\n\n386\n00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.380\nlocks in place and that is your interface.\n\n387\n00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.530\nThe network adapter helps you to do that.\n\n388\n00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:11.740\nNot only physically, but also translates\nwhatever you want to send into well,\n\n389\n00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.990\nwhat can go across a copper cable wire or\n\n390\n00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.580\na light pulse that\nactually goes across here.\n\n391\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.520\nOr even into radio frequency ways.\n\n392\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.580\nThose are what we call network adapters.\n\n393\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.660\nEvery single computer today\nprobably has at least one of them.\n\n394\n00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.980\nWhether it's a wireless network adapter,\nwhether it's a bluetooth adapter.\n\n395\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.680\nWhether it's a physical cable or\n\n396\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.350\nwhether it's something you add\non to your computer to do that.\n\n397\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.416\nIt allows you to connect\nto that network and so\n\n398\n00:21:37.416 --> 00:21:41.100\nevery single computer tends to have one.\n\n399\n00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.880\nOr you can buy something that will allow\nyou to take a standard USB port and\n\n400\n00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.020\nturn it into one.\n\n401\n00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.685\nOr even some of the other ports that are\nout there and turn it into one as well.\n\n402\n00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.630\n>> Aha, so\nthat phones in the foundation for\n\n403\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.670\nthe physical connectivity between devices.\n\n404\n00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.268\n>> Yeah, it really does.\n\n405\n00:21:55.268 --> 00:21:57.700\n>> So the adapter could\nbe mounted over there and\n\n406\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.778\nthere is a port that you can\nuse to connect that computer.\n\n407\n00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:05.890\nRight on my screen, now I have\npositioned an image of a switch.\n\n408\n00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.390\nAnd the switch enables\nthe computers to be connected.\n\n409\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.390\nSo we just talk about\na local area network.\n\n410\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.700\n>> Right.\n>> So that means somewhere along the way,\n\n411\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.930\nthere has to be a connection.\n\n412\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.060\nSo let's think about it,\nif you had four computers and\n\n413\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.010\nyou need to connect all of them together.\n\n414\n00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.790\nThen it means you potentially\nneed to have some wire from\n\n415\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.860\neach of the computer\nto the four computers.\n\n416\n00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.790\nAnd then there are so\n\n417\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:30.560\nmany wires out there, so then someone\nthought about this, let's create a switch.\n\n418\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.380\nSo what we simply do is that we connect\neach of the computers through this\n\n419\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.310\nparticular switch using that\nnetwork adapter connection.\n\n420\n00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:42.480\nAnd we got this wire out there and\nall the devices now are connected.\n\n421\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:48.360\nSo I'm also holding another\nkind of switch in my hand and\n\n422\n00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.000\nas you can see,\nall those ports are in there.\n\n423\n00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.422\nYou power it up here and then connect\nall the computers over there and\n\n424\n00:22:54.422 --> 00:22:55.812\nboom, you're good to go.\n\n425\n00:22:55.812 --> 00:22:57.240\nDoes that sound right?\n\n426\n00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.850\n>> Yes, when you start taking s\nlook at the idea of the switch and\n\n427\n00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.940\nthey were simpler devices\nthat we call hubs.\n\n428\n00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.560\nHubs just allow you to connect all those\ndevices together without needing so\n\n429\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.560\nmany different cables like Dr.\nOmwanza was talking about.\n\n430\n00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.000\nBut it did it inefficiently.\n\n431\n00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.370\nWhen you plugged everything into a hub,\neverybody could essentially\n\n432\n00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:18.200\nhear each other and\nthey would have to just drop the signal.\n\n433\n00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.195\nSo in that type of network only one\ndevice can communicate at any one time.\n\n434\n00:23:22.195 --> 00:23:25.910\nInstead when you use a newer\ntechnology that's called a switch,\n\n435\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.340\nthey do not cause interference\nwith the other devices.\n\n436\n00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.540\nAnd so on that physical switch like Dr.\nTonny was showing us here.\n\n437\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.320\nTwo devices that are plugged\ninto two separate ports, well,\n\n438\n00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.600\nthey can communicate.\n\n439\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.390\nAnother two devices that\nare plugged into another two ports,\n\n440\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.630\nthey can also communicate\nexactly at the same time.\n\n441\n00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.752\nAnd that is because of the hardware and\n\n442\n00:23:45.752 --> 00:23:48.218\nthe software that is\nbuilt into the device.\n\n443\n00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:52.885\nIt knows how to control it, it knows how\nto actually say send it without actually\n\n444\n00:23:52.885 --> 00:23:55.615\ngoing across and\nflooding every single port.\n\n445\n00:23:55.615 --> 00:23:58.631\nWhereas there are simpler connectivity\ndevices in the beginning didn't know\n\n446\n00:23:58.631 --> 00:23:59.231\nhow to do that.\n\n447\n00:23:59.231 --> 00:24:01.975\nSo switches are what we tend\nto see in networks today.\n\n448\n00:24:01.975 --> 00:24:05.236\nWhether it's something like this\nthat you can buy at a store,\n\n449\n00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:09.376\nor inside of your network which they can\nbe very very expensive because there is\n\n450\n00:24:09.376 --> 00:24:11.750\na lot more control features on them.\n\n451\n00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.790\nThey really do the same\nbasic functions and so\n\n452\n00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.860\nyou'll probably see that most of the time,\nyou're gonna be working inside of\n\n453\n00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.690\na switched local area network is\nprobably what you'll end up seeing.\n\n454\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:29.192\n>> So other than the switch chances are\nthat we're gonna interact with a router.\n\n455\n00:24:29.192 --> 00:24:33.390\nAt some point in time which as long\nas we go into internet connectivity\n\n456\n00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:37.870\nwe probably have to figure out how\ndid we connect to the internet.\n\n457\n00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:42.930\nSo, right on my screen am also,\nI have another image here of a router,\n\n458\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:47.620\nand as you can see, it's kind of like\nthe same thing as a switch, right?\n\n459\n00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.560\nJust got some connections over here but\nall of a sudden, I seem to see that\n\n460\n00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.300\none of them looks a little different from\nthe rest and you know, other than that,\n\n461\n00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.620\nit seems like it's kind of like\nthe same thing so the router then does\n\n462\n00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.650\ntwo different things, one not only does\nit enable us to connect computers, but\n\n463\n00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.490\nit also connects the network that\nwe've created onto the internet.\n\n464\n00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:12.280\nAnd then, the router also can enable\nus to have wireless connectivity\n\n465\n00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.110\nin a simple geographical area.\n\n466\n00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.840\nIs that correct?\n\n467\n00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.230\n>> It really can, what routers allow us to\ndo is to connect two different networks\n\n468\n00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:23.300\ntogether Because of the way the that\na switch functions, where it can only send\n\n469\n00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.740\nout to devices that are directly\nconnected only to this device.\n\n470\n00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.660\nSo, on a switch and\n\n471\n00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:34.180\nyou want to send data out, it has to\nbe out of one of these other ports.\n\n472\n00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.710\nWell what if the device\nyou want to connect\n\n473\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.350\nisn't actually on one of these ports,\nwell what you need instead is a router.\n\n474\n00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.070\nOur router says,\nlook I can send it to another device\n\n475\n00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.370\nthat may actually be connected\nto another switch or\n\n476\n00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.940\neven to another network out there and\nI can get it there.\n\n477\n00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.190\nSo when you talk about\nconnecting two lands together,\n\n478\n00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.070\ntwo local area networks together, you need\nat least a router that will allow it to\n\n479\n00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.176\nsay, I know how to get\nthe information from one to another.\n\n480\n00:26:02.176 --> 00:26:06.150\nAnd what Dr. Armonzo was also\npointing out in that where he says,\n\n481\n00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:11.070\nit's also seems like a switch right here\nand there was actually a different port.\n\n482\n00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.060\nLet me see if I can point to it correctly,\n\n483\n00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.210\nthis blue one that you\nkind of see right here.\n\n484\n00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.880\nWhen you see that, well that is\nactually representing the router and\n\n485\n00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.510\nthis side is representing a switch.\n\n486\n00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.790\nAnd this one also has a wireless\nantenna so this device is actually\n\n487\n00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:32.210\na multi-function device that encompasses\nall three technologies for us.\n\n488\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.790\nIf I want to connect to the internet,\nI tend to go ahead and\n\n489\n00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.010\nplug that in, right here.\n\n490\n00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:41.950\nAnd then, on my own network,\nI can plug in my computer, my printer,\n\n491\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:46.280\nanother computer if I want to, I might\neven be able to plug in another device.\n\n492\n00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.500\nAnd now as long as data is coming through,\nthis port right over here,\n\n493\n00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.930\nis can gain access to of course,\nthese ports over here.\n\n494\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.890\nAnd if these guys,\nwhoever's actually on here,\n\n495\n00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.890\nthese send out to another network,\nwell it sends it out this port over here.\n\n496\n00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.070\nSo that's what a router allows us to do,\n\n497\n00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:07.160\nis to connect multiple different\nnetworks if we actually need to.\n\n498\n00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.880\nIn the home situation we\nnormally just connect it to\n\n499\n00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.990\nour internet service provider and\nthen we are up and we are ready to go.\n\n500\n00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.390\n>> All right, you know,\n\n501\n00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:20.520\nthe amount that we have here determines\nhow much depth we can go into.\n\n502\n00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.060\nSo we're just going to move\non a little bit and, no.\n\n503\n00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.880\nIn a little while we spoke about\nthe you know the cables that we could\n\n504\n00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.950\npossibly connect and the variety of them.\n\n505\n00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.830\nSo we probably wouldn't\nnow again repeat on that.\n\n506\n00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.460\nLet's just talk a little\nbit about the internet.\n\n507\n00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:39.620\nYou know,\ndepending on the context you are in,\n\n508\n00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.300\nit's useful to get a sense of\nhow does the internet work.\n\n509\n00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.990\nSometimes you might feel that\na computer is a little slow.\n\n510\n00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:48.410\nYou'll try to send something and\nit's a little bit slow or\n\n511\n00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.790\nmaybe you're trying to send\nan attachment maybe you're struggling.\n\n512\n00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:57.970\nSo what is this thing that really ships\nthe speed at which we can send things and\n\n513\n00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.750\nthe kind of resources that we pay for\nit and stuff like this.\n\n514\n00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.980\nWhat is this thing called bandwidth.\n\n515\n00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.840\n>> The idea of bandwidth is\nthe capacity that we tend to have.\n\n516\n00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.790\nWhen we connect out to the internet and if\nyou are connected to the Internet through\n\n517\n00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:15.000\nan internet service provider, you pay for\nthe amount of bandwidth you have.\n\n518\n00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.750\nA slow bandwidth connection or\n\n519\n00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.130\na very minimal bandwidth connection\nwill not cost you as much\n\n520\n00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:25.050\nas a connection that has a high amount\nof bandwidth which means more capacity.\n\n521\n00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:29.210\nThe more that you can put on to\nthat wire at one point in time,\n\n522\n00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.450\nthe faster your connection is going to\nbecause you can deliver more at one\n\n523\n00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.390\ntime and you can receive more at one time.\n\n524\n00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.530\nWell, the smaller that\nparticular bandwidth is,\n\n525\n00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:42.860\nit means you cannot receive as much,\nnor can you send as much at one time.\n\n526\n00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.960\nSo that is really kind of the controlling\nfactor when you start to talk about\n\n527\n00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.420\nthat idea of internet speeds for\nwhether you'll talk about a company or\n\n528\n00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.700\nwhether you'll talk about as\nan individual home user as well.\n\n529\n00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.560\n>> Right, so we don't get to\nconnect to internet directly.\n\n530\n00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.880\nWe've got service providers who do that.\n\n531\n00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.930\nSo that's why internet service\nproviders are there and who provide.\n\n532\n00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.110\nAnd the different types and\nthey provide that connectivity to us.\n\n533\n00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.640\nWe pay on a certain package, whether,\n\n534\n00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.150\nwhich is a function of the kind\nof bandwidth that we want,\n\n535\n00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.120\nthe reliability that we're expecting,\nand things like that.\n\n536\n00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.520\nSo, we make choices.\n\n537\n00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.700\nAnd, so,\ndepending on how your computer functions,\n\n538\n00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.290\nit could be a reflection of the kind\nof bandwidth that you've got.\n\n539\n00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:30.730\nSo think of it as a pipe, the larger the\npipe or depending on much pressure there\n\n540\n00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:34.770\nis if there is water flowing in that pipe,\ndepending on how much water is flowing it,\n\n541\n00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.870\nit gives you a sense of the speed and the\nkind of output that you can possibly get.\n\n542\n00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:43.030\nAll right, so\nwe got different kind of connectivity and\n\n543\n00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:48.910\nwhen we spoke about satellite,\nand we spoke about, you know,\n\n544\n00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:53.320\nthe connectivity of blue, broadband\nconnectivity, and, we have different\n\n545\n00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.400\ntypes of connectivity and maybe we can\njust talk a little about those options.\n\n546\n00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.510\nBefore we start thinking\nabout trouble shooting,\n\n547\n00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.750\nwhen things just don't seem right.\n\n548\n00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.580\n>> All right, when we start talking about\nthis different types of connectivity\n\n549\n00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.040\nthe slowest one that you can\nget is a dial up connection.\n\n550\n00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.400\nThis requires you to have another device\ncalled a modem that will then dial up\n\n551\n00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.770\nto your internet service provider or\na telephone line and you can connect.\n\n552\n00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:19.750\nEven though this is one of the more\nuniversal connections on the planet today\n\n553\n00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:24.133\nit is a very slow connection and\nmost of the time people today really will\n\n554\n00:30:24.133 --> 00:30:28.490\nnot appreciate the idea of dial up\nunless you do not have any other option.\n\n555\n00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.070\nThere is also, of course,\n\n556\n00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:34.520\ncable internet options that are out there\nthat provide better bandwidth for you.\n\n557\n00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.670\nAlways on internet connection.\n\n558\n00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.050\nSo whereas a dial-up actually\nrequires you to dial up and\n\n559\n00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.500\nthen of course you can hang up as well.\n\n560\n00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.170\nThe always on types of internet\nconnections are things like\n\n561\n00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.450\ncable internet.\n\n562\n00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:50.450\nAlso you hear the term DSL for\ndigital subscriber line.\n\n563\n00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.650\nThose are also very possible for us.\n\n564\n00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.600\nAnd even the satellite internet\nconnections that we were talking about,\n\n565\n00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.230\nand cellular options that\nwe were talking about,\n\n566\n00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.550\nall those are just special types\nof connections that we can do.\n\n567\n00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.280\nEach one, of course,\nwill be varied in cost.\n\n568\n00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.690\nDepending on of course not only\nthe amount of bandwidth that you get.\n\n569\n00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:13.600\nBut sometimes like on a cellular network\nit depends on how much you actually send.\n\n570\n00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.000\nSo you may actually get a limit\nthat you can actually use.\n\n571\n00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.920\nUntil you run out and then you will\nnot be able to use it anymore.\n\n572\n00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.550\nSo you may also end up seeing that.\n\n573\n00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.180\nAnd the same thing also happens\nover satellite connections as well.\n\n574\n00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.370\nThey may say here it is you have 20\nGigabytes and that's it for one month,\n\n575\n00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:35.630\nif you hit that 20 on day one, you don't\nget anymore until you pay your fee and\n\n576\n00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.870\nthen you have to actually go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n577\n00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.420\nSo there are some of those different\noptions that are available for\n\n578\n00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.920\nus depending on what you\nhave inside of your city.\n\n579\n00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.090\n>> Yeah, so think about it now.\n\n580\n00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:47.900\nFor you to have this\nconnection to the internet,\n\n581\n00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.740\nthere's several things\nthat must be in place.\n\n582\n00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.485\nSo we spoke about a switch,\nwe spoke about the router,\n\n583\n00:31:53.485 --> 00:31:56.900\nwe spoke about you know the various\ncords or cables for that matter.\n\n584\n00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:03.035\nWhich we have a software component within\nthe computer that must function as well.\n\n585\n00:32:03.035 --> 00:32:07.475\nWe spoke about a network adapter\nthat also must function as well\n\n586\n00:32:07.475 --> 00:32:11.770\nThe routers have to be powered,\nswitches, all this stuff.\n\n587\n00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:15.500\nSo think about it, sometimes you may\nhave a problem with your connectivity.\n\n588\n00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:21.060\nMaybe one of all these things, maybe the\nsoftware is not functioning properly or\n\n589\n00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:26.189\nmaybe, we spoke about when we\nconnect new devices on to computers.\n\n590\n00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.360\nThere can be software that might probably\nfail, it could be maybe something with\n\n591\n00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.940\nthe operating system, or it could be\nsomething with the network adaptor.\n\n592\n00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.000\nIt could be something with maybe the cord,\n\n593\n00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.450\nit doesn't seem to be functioning\nwell because it's a consumable.\n\n594\n00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.590\nAt some point in time, they just\ndon't seem to function very well.\n\n595\n00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:48.990\nSo it could be anything ,and every time\nyou have a failure of connectivity,\n\n596\n00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.280\nask yourself,\ncould it be a software problem?\n\n597\n00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.860\nCould it be a hardware problem?\n\n598\n00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.310\nCould it be computer related?\n\n599\n00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:57.290\nOr could it be the components\nthat are connecting?\n\n600\n00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:01.010\nOr it could have even be the Internet\nservice provider related issue?\n\n601\n00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:04.320\nSo first of all, the most important\nthing is trying to figure out\n\n602\n00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.300\nwhere could possibly the problem be.\n\n603\n00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.270\nThe good thing about the router is it\ncould easily show you with some lights,\n\n604\n00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.860\nblinks and give you a sense of the status.\n\n605\n00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.450\nAnd look at the manual, it gives you\nsense of what all the signals mean.\n\n606\n00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.200\nSometimes you might receive\na communication from an Internet service\n\n607\n00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.270\nprovider telling you\nthat there is a problem.\n\n608\n00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.490\nOr maybe somebody disconnected\nsomething out there.\n\n609\n00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.700\nSo each of all those are possible.\n\n610\n00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:31.652\nAnd in most cases, at organizational\nlevel, we've got network service managers.\n\n611\n00:33:31.652 --> 00:33:36.050\nPeople who, because connectivity can\nbe a complex thing to put together.\n\n612\n00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.000\nSo looking up to them and inquiring and\n\n613\n00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.750\nengaging with them can more\nthan help you to support\n\n614\n00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:45.610\nto ensure that your connectivity is up and\nrunning all the time.\n\n615\n00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:47.000\n>> There is no doubt, Dr.\n\n616\n00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.350\nOmwanza, that the idea of troubleshooting\nmay be a little bit above what we can do\n\n617\n00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.280\nat this point, but there are some\nsimple things we can check out.\n\n618\n00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.140\nVerify that you are connected.\n\n619\n00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.060\nMake sure that your cable is\nactually plugged into the wall jack.\n\n620\n00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.590\nMake sure it's plugged into\nthe back of the computer.\n\n621\n00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.570\nThen if you go, I don't know if\nwe're still connected, try and\n\n622\n00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.450\njust open up your web browser and\n\n623\n00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:12.360\nsee if you can connect to an Internet site\nthat sees if it brings up that webpage.\n\n624\n00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.610\nIf it does,\nyou probably have connectivity,\n\n625\n00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.732\nthen there may be some other\nissue you're dealing with.\n\n626\n00:34:16.732 --> 00:34:18.650\nDo not always assume the worst.\n\n627\n00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:23.030\nAlways start with the most basic things\nand work your way through that process.\n\n628\n00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.640\nBreak it down if it’s\nhardware versus software and\n\n629\n00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.740\nthen start troubleshooting one\nuntil you come to an issue or\n\n630\n00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:32.200\nyou find out everything is good there and\nthen start troubleshooting the other.\n\n631\n00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.760\nSo it's always the idea to start\nwith something that you know that\n\n632\n00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.100\nhas to actually work and\nthen verify that all that is good.\n\n633\n00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.510\nAnd then whatever isn't working, well,\n\n634\n00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.639\nthat's probably going to be\nyour issue at that point.\n\n635\n00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:46.420\nDr Omwansa, any last parting words here on\ntaking a look at the idea of network and\n\n636\n00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.920\nInternet types of connectivity\nthat we're talking about?\n\n637\n00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.820\n>> Well, I think we've really\ncovered the foundation.\n\n638\n00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.390\nIn the next episode, we'll start\ngetting into a little more detail.\n\n639\n00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:59.030\nSo from now on,\nto believe that you've seen the value,\n\n640\n00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.730\nyou've really appreciated the value\nof connectivity and the need for\n\n641\n00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.900\nyou to be interacting with\nthe rest of the world.\n\n642\n00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.300\nAnd then you got a sense of the different\ntypes of networks out there,\n\n643\n00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.100\nthe different kind of devices.\n\n644\n00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.050\nI mean, we didn't exhaust all of them,\nwe didn't show all of them but\n\n645\n00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.405\nit gives you a sense of what\nsome of these things are.\n\n646\n00:35:15.405 --> 00:35:17.100\nConnection on to the computer and\n\n647\n00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.900\nwhat it takes, as well as troubleshooting\nin the event you've got a problem.\n\n648\n00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.350\nSo from me, that's it.\n\n649\n00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.319\n>> All right, well, thank you again, Dr.\n\n650\n00:35:24.319 --> 00:35:26.560\nTonny, for\nintroducing us to these concepts.\n\n651\n00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.780\nAnd thank you also for watching.\n\n652\n00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.530\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n653\n00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:36.021\n>> And my name is Doctor Tonny Omwansa\nenjoying learning together the foundations\n\n654\n00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:37.640\nof computer networks.\n\n655\n00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.452\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore computing fundamentals.\n\n656\n00:35:41.452 --> 00:35:50.190\n[SOUND]\n\n",

They end the episode by taking a brief look at using an email application.",

--> 00:00:17.503\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:20.894\nyou're watching\nthe Computing Fundamentals IC3 show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:24.266\nWe're about to talk about not only\nconnecting to the internet, but\n\n6\n00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:28.056\nthat there is actually some online\ncommunication things that we really need\n\n7\n00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:31.140\nto know about because\nconnectivity is only the basics.\n\n8\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.070\nThe idea of using these networks\nare all about connecting and\n\n9\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.810\nfiguring out how to do that.\n\n10\n00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.685\nAnd helping us today is gonna be Dr.\nTonny Omwansa.\n\n11\n00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:40.840\nDr. Tonny, welcome back to our studios.\n\n12\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.740\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n13\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.510\nI'm glad that we're making\none step at a time and\n\n14\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.180\nnow we're gonna be discussing further.\n\n15\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.890\nNow that we have an internet,\nwe have connected computer,\n\n16\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.530\nthey are able to communicate,\nwhat could we possibly do with that?\n\n17\n00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.970\n>> It is something that\nwe have to realize.\n\n18\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.710\nThat now that you are connected,\nyou move beyond\n\n19\n00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.170\nthe boundaries of even culture a lot of\ntimes and realize that there's actually\n\n20\n00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.410\nsomething else that has to be established,\nwhich of course are the different\n\n21\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.680\nways that we can communicate with\nother people around the world.\n\n22\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.400\nAnd that we'll find out that\nthere is a little bit of\n\n23\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.730\nsome protocols that we have to follow,\njust as people that are communicating.\n\n24\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.190\nSo Dr. Tonny, where are we going to begin?\n\n25\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.150\n>> Okay, we're gonna begin, first of all,\n\n26\n00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.050\nby understanding the types of\ncommunication that is gonna happen online.\n\n27\n00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.910\nLet's get to appreciate what forms of\ncommunication could possibly happen\n\n28\n00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.900\nbecause after you have\nthat infrastructure,\n\n29\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.170\nthat set of protocols that govern\nhow communication is gonna happen.\n\n30\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.930\nNow people need to communicate.\n\n31\n00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.280\nIt's just that the computer is\nan interface that facilitates that\n\n32\n00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.310\ncommunication.\n\n33\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.380\nSo we're gonna think of about the features\nthat enable that communication to\n\n34\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.780\ntake place.\n\n35\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.200\nHow do we appropriately communicate?\n\n36\n00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.310\nBecause you'll want to pass a message and\n\n37\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.720\nyou're passing a message to someone who\nreally can't see your face really clearly,\n\n38\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.040\nthey can't get to hear\nyour voice directly.\n\n39\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.920\nAnd you need to effectively communicate.\n\n40\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.990\nHow do we ensure that happens?\n\n41\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.800\nWe have to think about\nappropriate etiquette and\n\n42\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.880\nwe gotta think about which tools do we\nuse for what kind of communication.\n\n43\n00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.640\nIf I wanna send you a very simple\nquick message, maybe email may not be\n\n44\n00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.350\nthe most appropriate because of the way\nthe email technology is configured.\n\n45\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.670\nSo we'll be looking at all that.\n\n46\n00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.140\nSet up of various ways of communicating.\n\n47\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.660\nAnd then in the process,\nyou might be able to choose as to\n\n48\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.068\nwhich mechanism do you want to use for\nwhich kind of communication.\n\n49\n00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:35.000\n>> Now Dr. Tonny, when I first got\nintroduced to working on the Internet or\n\n50\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.330\nusing the Internet,\neverything that I really had to do was\n\n51\n00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.460\nreally based on static\ninformation that I would get.\n\n52\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.330\n>> I would have sent\nyou read something and\n\n53\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.670\nthen if I had a question, I might\nbe able to post it and maybe two or\n\n54\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.700\nthree days later somebody\nmight actually answer me back.\n\n55\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.900\nAnd I would read that and\nthen I would maybe have another question.\n\n56\n00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.320\nAnd it would maybe take about\na week before I really got a lot of\n\n57\n00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.490\ninformation back.\n\n58\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.040\nBut in today's world, though,\n\n59\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.480\nand the way that the Internet is\nnow really at some maturity level,\n\n60\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.840\nwe have different ways that we communicate\nand actually make it a lot more effective.\n\n61\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.720\nSo, what are we gonna\ntake a look at first?\n\n62\n00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.410\n>> Absolutely.\n\n63\n00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.720\nThe very many techniques,\nvery many types of communication.\n\n64\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.850\nThink about it.\n\n65\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.200\nInstant messaging.\n\n66\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.690\nI like that word, instant.\n\n67\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.930\nSo I can send you a message instantly and\nyou can get it in a matter of seconds and\n\n68\n00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.790\nyou can respond, so\nyou don't have to wait for this.\n\n69\n00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.560\nIt's not like sending a physical\nletter and then someone reads, and\n\n70\n00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.595\nI like the way you say someone\nmay respond, all right.\n\n71\n00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:37.320\n[LAUGH] So you're not absolutely sure.\n\n72\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.570\nSomething might happen along the way.\n\n73\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.150\nWe have social networking mechanisms now,\nvery many social media platforms that\n\n74\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.930\nexist that you can use not only to\ncommunicate with one person, but\n\n75\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.560\nyou can organize groups, and\nyou can instantly communicate.\n\n76\n00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.708\nThere are blogs and microblogs that\npeople use to send out thoughts,\n\n77\n00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:57.078\nreflections that they all ready have.\n\n78\n00:03:57.078 --> 00:03:59.790\nThere are newsgroups that you can sign up.\n\n79\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.180\nAnd you form a group of people who\nare interested in a similar subject.\n\n80\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.497\nAnd then you share information.\n\n81\n00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:06.059\nThere are forums.\n\n82\n00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.884\nThere is voice over IP which enables\nus to have all your conversations via\n\n83\n00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:12.060\nthe computer.\n\n84\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.600\nThat means you don't necessarily\nhave to rely on a phone.\n\n85\n00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.250\nWe've got video chat,\nwe've got video conferencing.\n\n86\n00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.260\nSo if you're in a work environment and\n\n87\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.170\nyou have other offices that\nare located in different places.\n\n88\n00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.210\nYou're going to have to use the Internet\nto have an almost close to reality kind of\n\n89\n00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.530\nconversation, where you see someone\nout there, and you're over here, and\n\n90\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.010\nthey can see you on the other end and\nyou have a conversation.\n\n91\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.070\nAnd you can use multiple tools here and\nthere.\n\n92\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.180\nSo it's possible to even have\nthe agenda displayed on the right and\n\n93\n00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.950\nthen somebody is sticking notes.\n\n94\n00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.660\nI have seen scenarios where people have\nconferences, real conferences, but\n\n95\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.150\nthey're all electronic.\n\n96\n00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.990\nSo people don't get to go to physically\nto a certain place to have a conference.\n\n97\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.630\nAnd all those technologies exist and\n\n98\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.860\nit'll be exciting to look into\na few of them in a little while.\n\n99\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.720\nSo right now,\nI want to position something on my screen.\n\n100\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.320\nA diagram that simply illustrates roughly\n\n101\n00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.640\nhow does this kind of\ncommunication takes place?\n\n102\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.730\nNow not all these communication\noptions that I just mentioned earlier\n\n103\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.310\nwork like this but this is but an example.\n\n104\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.155\nSo, email is a very good place to start,\nRonnie.\n\n105\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.370\nAnd you normally talk about this to and\nforward concept.\n\n106\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.920\nYou know,\nI've always wondered what exactly that is.\n\n107\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.150\nBut am sure you're going to\nexplain to us a little while,\n\n108\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.060\nafter explaining this diagram.\n\n109\n00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.800\nSo look at this diagram here.\n\n110\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.410\nSo, there is a computer on one end, and\nthis is what you normally get to use.\n\n111\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.880\nThis is a PC,\nit could have been any kind of computer.\n\n112\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.140\nAnd then now,\nhere you're gonna type some email.\n\n113\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.370\nEmail is simply electronic email.\n\n114\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.830\nSo it's just like the physical\nletter that you'd have sent, but\n\n115\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.230\nnow it's in electronic form.\n\n116\n00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.060\nSo then when you send it,\nyou're gonna type it, compose it, and\n\n117\n00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.700\nput whatever you want to put there,\nand then press a button to send it.\n\n118\n00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.070\nAnd then that computer will\nsend it to some server.\n\n119\n00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.110\nSo then this server, because really, think\nabout it, every time, you check email,\n\n120\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.350\nthat email is not stored on your computer,\nbecause otherwise if it was,\n\n121\n00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.340\nthen you don't need internet\nconnectivity in order to access it.\n\n122\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.410\nAnd it's so much email that possibly\nyour computer can't even store it.\n\n123\n00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.572\nSo it's stored on a server somewhere.\n\n124\n00:06:23.572 --> 00:06:27.805\nSo the first thing that is gonna happen is\nthat your computer is going to send this\n\n125\n00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:31.670\nto your internal server, the server\nthat is used to forward your email.\n\n126\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.400\nAnd that email from that server is\ngoing to be sent to another server\n\n127\n00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.858\nwhich is now the receiver server.\n\n128\n00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:41.234\nAfter which it can then\nbe accessed back and\n\n129\n00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.212\nforth from the person who is\ngoing to read that email.\n\n130\n00:06:44.212 --> 00:06:48.710\nAnd that email when they respond also\nthat passed in the reverse order and\n\n131\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.710\npeople finally can receive it.\n\n132\n00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.130\nDoes that give a sense of email and\n\n133\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.240\nmaybe at that point in time you can tell\nus a little bit about store and forward.\n\n134\n00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.430\n>> All right so that's what we talk about\nwhen you start thinking about the idea\n\n135\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.190\nhere of some type of store and\nforwarding, that is a synchronous idea.\n\n136\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.790\nNow, those used to really take a long time\nbefore you would get some messages back\n\n137\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.520\nand sometimes of course\nemail still works that way.\n\n138\n00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.730\nBut that's not the only type of\ncommunication that we have today.\n\n139\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.750\nA lot of times it is more what\nseems like it's synchronous.\n\n140\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.970\nAnd the very fact that it looks\nlike it's real-time communication\n\n141\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.238\nthat requires both parties to\nbe online at the same time.\n\n142\n00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:32.530\nNow Dr. Omwansa,\nI noticed that you did use Skype, and\n\n143\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.980\nthat is not that store and\nforwarding type of system anymore.\n\n144\n00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.340\nInstead, it actually allows\nyou to make that connection,\n\n145\n00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.490\nallows you to use a technology that\nwe call VOIP, the Voice Over IP\n\n146\n00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.750\ntype of networking that allows for\nthere to be synchronous communication.\n\n147\n00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.150\nBoth sides can essentially\ntalk at the same time.\n\n148\n00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.640\nAnd even though it may just be\nmilliseconds off, it's not off by much.\n\n149\n00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.440\nAnd so in today's Internet communication\npatterns there are still both messages\n\n150\n00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.382\nthat are out there.\n\n151\n00:08:00.382 --> 00:08:03.920\nSometimes you might do the store and\nforward in things like forums And\n\n152\n00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.336\nposts like what we were talking about and\neven social networking,\n\n153\n00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:10.508\na lot of times is that store\nreporting when you're waiting for\n\n154\n00:08:10.508 --> 00:08:13.330\na response to come back\nbefore you can respond.\n\n155\n00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.540\nAnd other times like the voice and\nvideo conferencing, as well as things like\n\n156\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.620\nthe Skype that we were talking about, all\nthese are actually more synchronous and\n\n157\n00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.940\nthey allow for that live or\nreal time type of communication as well.\n\n158\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.980\nSo those are kind of the two basic types\nof communications when you break it down.\n\n159\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.190\nAnd then of course, all these other\ntechnologies that we've mentioned\n\n160\n00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.290\nas well come into play with that.\n\n161\n00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:40.350\nNow inside of business, everybody\ntends to use email even to this day.\n\n162\n00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:46.290\nIt is because it is the life blood of\ncommunications within most companies\n\n163\n00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.740\nthat actually allows for us to track and\nto actually keep messages and\n\n164\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.220\nto be able to respond to them\nin the way that we need to.\n\n165\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.390\nAt the same time, it's one of the most\ncritical systems that we have available\n\n166\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.360\nbecause everyone today that's actually\nconnected to networks, we rely on emails\n\n167\n00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.412\nquite a lot even though things like\ninstant messaging, which allows us to\n\n168\n00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:10.500\nbe able to do things like chat and\ninstant messaging types of things,\n\n169\n00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.070\nwell those are good but sometimes it's\njust not as live as you want it to be.\n\n170\n00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.980\nThe person not sitting on the other end.\n\n171\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.780\nAnd then you don't know when\nthey see the message and\n\n172\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.210\nyou don't know how long it takes.\n\n173\n00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.580\nIt's just one of those things which can be\nuseful as long as people are monitoring\n\n174\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.280\nthe system, but not so useful if they're\nnot monitoring the system as well.\n\n175\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.080\nSo very many different types of online\ncommunication that we can use and\n\n176\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.050\nyou should take advantage of\na lot of these technologies.\n\n177\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.190\nThe social networking is by\nfar the most popular type.\n\n178\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.900\nThings like Facebook, Twitter,\nall of these are actually very popular\n\n179\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.740\ntypes of social networking\nthat allow you to be able to\n\n180\n00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.840\ncommunicate very effectively to a large\nquantity of people very quickly as well.\n\n181\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.350\n>> Absolutely.\n\n182\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.229\nThat actually has just ushered\nus into thinking about what this\n\n183\n00:09:55.229 --> 00:10:00.100\nkind of Eastern kind of\ncommunication looks like.\n\n184\n00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.492\nWe talked about social media,\nwe talked about sending text or\n\n185\n00:10:05.492 --> 00:10:09.449\ntext messaging, we talked about blogging.\n\n186\n00:10:09.449 --> 00:10:12.950\nWe talked about YouTube,\nthe different kind of things.\n\n187\n00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.060\nNow, it's important for\n\n188\n00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:20.920\nyou to think about appropriateness of\nvarious technologies of communication.\n\n189\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.370\nThink about the perception that is created\nabout different kind of technologies.\n\n190\n00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.240\nThink about the focus of\ndifferent kind of technologies and\n\n191\n00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.760\nthe kind of communication\nthat you want to have.\n\n192\n00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.950\nSo when you think about something like\nan instant messaging kind of technology,\n\n193\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.790\nit may be provided on\nthe computer through internet or\n\n194\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.450\nit may be provided by a cellular company.\n\n195\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.690\nYou can send a text on the phone,\n\n196\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.990\nthat means you must be having the number\nof the person that you want to send to.\n\n197\n00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.490\nAnd again,\nyou have some limitations here and\n\n198\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.100\nthere of the kind of information that you\ncan send, how much data can you send.\n\n199\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.490\nA simple text can probably occupy so\nmany characters.\n\n200\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.840\nYou may not be able to send a whole page\nunless maybe you're sending a link, and\n\n201\n00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.740\nthings like that.\n\n202\n00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.560\nSo there are strengths and\nlimitations of various technologies and\n\n203\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.060\nyou want to make a decision as\nwhat is the most appropriate.\n\n204\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.960\nThey're all useful in one way or\n\n205\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.040\nanother, depending on the purpose that\nyou actually want to use them for.\n\n206\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.500\nThere's an interesting technology\nthat we want to think about, push and\n\n207\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.790\npull technology that enables you\nto immediately send something\n\n208\n00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.580\nwithout having received a request for\nit, all right.\n\n209\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.730\nSo that push technology enables\nyou to send through someone,\n\n210\n00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.240\nyou may send to many people or one person.\n\n211\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.990\nAnd the pull technology enables\nyou to actually get content.\n\n212\n00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.080\nYou also have to be careful,\nyou don't want to look like you're sending\n\n213\n00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.031\npeople things, although without\nnecessarily having thought about\n\n214\n00:11:52.031 --> 00:11:54.650\nthe implications of whatever\nyou are sending to them.\n\n215\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.070\nSo now we are going to be talking bout\nthe etiquette and the discipline and\n\n216\n00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.320\nthe values that we want to promote\nin the use of technologies for\n\n217\n00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.486\npurpose of communication.\n\n218\n00:12:03.486 --> 00:12:06.400\n>> Alright so Dr. Anwanza,\n\n219\n00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.320\nwhen we start taking a look down about\nsome of the things you were talking about,\n\n220\n00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.250\nin terms of the appropriateness of\ncommunication, a lot of that has to deal\n\n221\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.240\nwith how you're gonna categorize that\ncommunication, especially online.\n\n222\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.740\nYou either are going to be doing it for\npersonal use or\n\n223\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.080\nyou're gonna be doing it for\nprofessional use.\n\n224\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.570\nAnd you do need to think about that and\n\n225\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.250\nactually understand that\nthe delineation today.\n\n226\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.770\nFor personal use, for things like fun, for\n\n227\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:33.730\ncommunicating with your family,\nit is okay that you do and you speak and\n\n228\n00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.160\nyou type and you use a lot of the fancy\nfeatures that are available to you.\n\n229\n00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.800\nBut inside of a business communication,\nit may not be the same way.\n\n230\n00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.830\nSo you want to take that into\nmoderation and consideration as well.\n\n231\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.422\nThe only key that I give you here or\nhint or\n\n232\n00:12:49.422 --> 00:12:53.470\nadvice that I would say is\nnever communicate something,\n\n233\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.570\nespecially over instant messaging or an\nemail, that you would not find appropriate\n\n234\n00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.180\nif it were to fall into someone's\nhands that it wasn't supposed to.\n\n235\n00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.800\nIn other words, if it arrives at\nsomebody's desk and it's not supposed to\n\n236\n00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.790\narrive, if I were sending an email, and\nhopefully I would never do this, but\n\n237\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.850\nif I were to send an email about Dr.\nAnwanza to someone.\n\n238\n00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.430\nAnd it was just saying, Dr.\nAnwanza, he really thinks that\n\n239\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:23.130\nhe's someone that he isn't, and he were\nto get it, would I be embarrassed by it.\n\n240\n00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.790\nThen don't send it, okay.\n\n241\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.880\nUnderstand that there's always an\nappropriateness to what you can have and\n\n242\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.720\neven though you may consider it personal,\n\n243\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.640\nit doesn't mean the person at\nthe other end considers it personal.\n\n244\n00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.016\nAnd they may instead go, Dr.\n\n245\n00:13:34.016 --> 00:13:38.220\nTony, look what Ronnie wrote about you,\nand actually just forward it on to him.\n\n246\n00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.230\nSo never send something [LAUGH]\nover that type of medium,\n\n247\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.840\nregardless of whether you're talking\nabout email or instant messaging,\n\n248\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.225\nthat you don't want somebody to print out\nand have it actually in somebody's hands.\n\n249\n00:13:48.225 --> 00:13:51.685\nThat could become embarrassing not\nonly for you, but maybe even for\n\n250\n00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:54.295\nyour company that you're\nrepresenting as you work for them.\n\n251\n00:13:54.295 --> 00:13:58.035\nDr. Tony, this can be very, very,\nvery embarrassing, could it not be.\n\n252\n00:13:58.035 --> 00:14:00.565\n>> Absolutely.\nI mean there are instances we may have\n\n253\n00:14:00.565 --> 00:14:06.335\nread in media about emails that\nwere sent between people and\n\n254\n00:14:06.335 --> 00:14:07.045\nthey were not appropriate.\n\n255\n00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:08.530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n256\n00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.730\n>> So you want to be careful.\n\n257\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:15.168\nYou don't want to be known as someone\nwho didn't apply good etiquette.\n\n258\n00:14:15.168 --> 00:14:18.770\nEven if you've met someone and you're\nhaving a conversation, you're very careful\n\n259\n00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.230\nabout how you communicate to them because\nyou want the relationship to be kept well.\n\n260\n00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.818\nThere's some things you can say can offend\nothers and you don't want to say that.\n\n261\n00:14:26.818 --> 00:14:31.820\nSo when you send email remember,\nespecially in digital form,\n\n262\n00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.710\nit can be copied.\n\n263\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.366\nCopies can be retained and\n\n264\n00:14:35.366 --> 00:14:39.540\ncan be circulated, and\nonce written it is always written.\n\n265\n00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.490\nIts gonna be very difficult to undo what\nhas been written and posted somewhere.\n\n266\n00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.525\nIf you're writing blog for\nexample or you're sending e-mail,\n\n267\n00:14:48.525 --> 00:14:53.920\neven if it's just messages on instant\nkind of technology, they can be saved.\n\n268\n00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.235\nThey can be stored somewhere, and so you\nwant to be careful what you write and what\n\n269\n00:14:58.235 --> 00:15:03.456\nyou send, and you want to be always be\nappropriate whenever you're communicating.\n\n270\n00:15:03.456 --> 00:15:06.885\n>> And so Dr. Awanza, we're really gonna\ntake a look a little bit more about some\n\n271\n00:15:06.885 --> 00:15:09.175\nof the details of setting up email, right?\n\n272\n00:15:09.175 --> 00:15:10.375\n>> Yes, that's correct.\n\n273\n00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:12.610\nIf you wanna set up an email,\n\n274\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:17.530\nan email now becomes some form\nof identity for yourself.\n\n275\n00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.770\nPeople will always associate you\nwith that particular identity.\n\n276\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.070\nOf course you can get rid of\nit at some point in time but\n\n277\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.080\nit's always a good habit.\n\n278\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.600\nI have kept mine for a while.\n\n279\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.720\nFor several years, I've use the same ID,\nthe same email address,\n\n280\n00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.010\nand people always communicate to me.\n\n281\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:37.090\nWe can have communications and then for\na while, we're probably not communicating,\n\n282\n00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.390\nand then later on we'll start again and\nwe still maintain that ID.\n\n283\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:45.120\nSo there's a sense of memory that goes\nwith it that you don't want to lose.\n\n284\n00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.020\nSo the first thing,\n\n285\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.960\nthinking about setting up that email, is\nthat you want a name you can relate with.\n\n286\n00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.321\nYou can easily call your email\naddress 1234567 at some provider,\n\n287\n00:15:56.321 --> 00:15:58.400\nsome service provider.\n\n288\n00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.370\nBut probably it doesn't give identity to\nyou, so you want some identity to it.\n\n289\n00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.208\nSometimes people, of course,\ncreate email addresses and\n\n290\n00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:08.770\nthey want to hide their identity,\nand that's okay.\n\n291\n00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.860\nI mean it can be respected in that case.\n\n292\n00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.060\nBut you want some name\nthat you can relate with.\n\n293\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.270\nAnd then remember you'll set up passwords.\n\n294\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.810\nYou want to make sure you\nhave strong passwords.\n\n295\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.280\nAnd by strong passwords in\nthis case we're saying,\n\n296\n00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:26.170\nsomething that can't easily be copied and\nreverse engineered.\n\n297\n00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.990\nSomebody thinks about it,\nthen all of a sudden they figure it out.\n\n298\n00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.450\nSo it has to be relatively complex, but\n\n299\n00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.510\nnot too complex that you\nalso can't remember it.\n\n300\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.930\nYou want to be able to remember,\nwhat was my password?\n\n301\n00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.280\nBecause it's personal.\n\n302\n00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.486\nIt's something unique,\nthat you can always come back to.\n\n303\n00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:47.369\nNow there are different providers\nof Internet services that\n\n304\n00:16:47.369 --> 00:16:49.767\ncan provide email services.\n\n305\n00:16:49.767 --> 00:16:52.979\nThey have the email servers and\nwhenever you send your email,\n\n306\n00:16:52.979 --> 00:16:55.096\nit's gonna be stored in those servers.\n\n307\n00:16:55.096 --> 00:16:58.947\nSo we would have done some\nillustrations of similar and\n\n308\n00:16:58.947 --> 00:17:04.473\nmy computer right now doesn't have the\ntool that I wanted to use to demonstrate\n\n309\n00:17:04.473 --> 00:17:09.496\nthe Microsoft option, but if you want\nto create an account with Gmail or\n\n310\n00:17:09.496 --> 00:17:13.206\nYahoo, there are hundreds\nof providers out there.\n\n311\n00:17:13.206 --> 00:17:16.439\nSome free and some are probably\nclassified and some are probably,\n\n312\n00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:20.690\nhave a cost [INAUDIBLE], depending on\nthe kind of services that they offer.\n\n313\n00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.970\nThe general principle is\ngoing to remain the same,\n\n314\n00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.520\nthat you're gonna key in your username and\nyour gonna create a password.\n\n315\n00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.890\nAnd you provide some possible details\nthat uniquely identify you, so\n\n316\n00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.950\nthat we are sure that no one\nis going to use your account.\n\n317\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.660\nAnd then probably you'll put something\nto help you remember the password,\n\n318\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.100\nsome hint, and\nthen from there you're good to go.\n\n319\n00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.850\nNow, whenever you create\nthis email account,\n\n320\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.630\nyou wanna be able to start sending and\nreceiving email.\n\n321\n00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:54.940\nYou can put some controls here and there\nabout email, for example, do you want them\n\n322\n00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.920\nto go to certain folders, how many emails\ndo you want to see, and all that stuff.\n\n323\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.710\nSo right now, on my screen,\nI have displayed a simple interface for\n\n324\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.510\nan account that have been created for\nthe Microsoft Outlook.\n\n325\n00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:14.320\nMicrosoft Outlook is a tool\nthat enables you to use email.\n\n326\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.290\nSo assuming an email\naccount has been created,\n\n327\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.260\nthere are several features out here.\n\n328\n00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.602\nBut to a large extent,\n\n329\n00:18:20.602 --> 00:18:25.551\nwhat you really want to know most is that\non my extreme left here that I'm pointing,\n\n330\n00:18:25.551 --> 00:18:30.306\nit shows you the inbox, which gives you\nat list of the emails that are coming in.\n\n331\n00:18:30.306 --> 00:18:34.280\nThere is a Sent Items that\nyou actually sent out.\n\n332\n00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.753\nThere are Drafts that\nyou haven't sent them.\n\n333\n00:18:37.753 --> 00:18:42.269\nThey probably, maybe you did not finish\ntyping them, maybe you are still getting\n\n334\n00:18:42.269 --> 00:18:46.459\nsome more information about that\nparticular, or maybe the power went off,\n\n335\n00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.800\nand then the computer\nautomatically saved that in Draft.\n\n336\n00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.270\nYou have Deleted Items, so\nevery time you read emails or\n\n337\n00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.410\nreceive emails, maybe some of them you\njust didn't want to receive them, and\n\n338\n00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.250\nyou just don't want to\ndeal with them anymore.\n\n339\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.000\nSo you can delete them,\nthat's an option as well.\n\n340\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.590\nThere are other items\nthere like Junk Mail,\n\n341\n00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.700\nand we won't go into all the details.\n\n342\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.560\nBut there are some emails that you,\nthere are some people out there or\n\n343\n00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.140\nsome software out there just keeps on\nsending things to other people, and\n\n344\n00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.960\nthey just accidentally\nget onto your computer.\n\n345\n00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.580\nSome emails maybe sent to you and\naccidentally get into the Junk Mail.\n\n346\n00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:27.440\nSo email that probably is not useful will\neasily find itself into the Junk Mail.\n\n347\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.576\nAnd there are several\nother features as well.\n\n348\n00:19:29.576 --> 00:19:33.567\nBut in addition,\nyou may want to think about, okay fine, so\n\n349\n00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:36.716\nhow do I compose the email and\nsend it and reply?\n\n350\n00:19:36.716 --> 00:19:41.203\nSo, once you've clicked, say for example,\nthe inbox you've got a list of the email\n\n351\n00:19:41.203 --> 00:19:45.457\naddresses, emails that have come to inbox,\nyou click one on the extreme right.\n\n352\n00:19:45.457 --> 00:19:47.570\nYou'll get an opportunity to read it.\n\n353\n00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:52.080\nNow, right up there you'll see the email\naddress from where the email came from.\n\n354\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.110\nWho sent the email.\n\n355\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.470\nSo it has an identity as well.\n\n356\n00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.430\nAnd then you're email will\nshow the time that it came.\n\n357\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.950\nAnd then the content of\nthe email will show as well.\n\n358\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.470\nThen, right there, you have an opportunity\nfor clicking if you want to Reply to that\n\n359\n00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.730\nemail or you want to Reply To All.\n\n360\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.840\nSometimes that email was sent\nto more than one person, so\n\n361\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.940\nyou may want everybody to be\npart of that conversation.\n\n362\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:22.200\nSo you can reply to all of them or you can\ndelete it or you can mark it as unread,\n\n363\n00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.490\nthat means you can come later and read it,\nso it appears that it has not been read.\n\n364\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.720\nSo all that options exist for\nprocesses of your communication.\n\n365\n00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.450\nThinking through it,\nthat's not the only tool available, but\n\n366\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.660\nthe principles around email is the same.\n\n367\n00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.770\nYou can attach a document.\n\n368\n00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.530\nYou can forward an email to someone else.\n\n369\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.310\nYou want someone else who was\nnot copied onto that email,\n\n370\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.500\nyou can forward to them so they can\nsee the exact email that came to you.\n\n371\n00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.450\nMaybe you want them to deal with it and\nnot yourself.\n\n372\n00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:00.060\nSo the features around email are generally\nsimilar irrespective of the platform,\n\n373\n00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.900\nof course, other providers will\nhave a little more features.\n\n374\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.440\nYou can easily find the calendar there.\n\n375\n00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.540\nYou can easily find a mechanism for\nscanning email, viruses and\n\n376\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.652\nthing like that.\n\n377\n00:21:11.652 --> 00:21:15.570\nAll the options exist and I wanna\nbelieve that it's a very powerful tool.\n\n378\n00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.110\nAnd, generally,\n\n379\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:22.290\nmany people who use Internet, they get\nuse an email, isn't it right Ronnie?\n\n380\n00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.830\n>> There is no doubt that email and\nlearning how to actually builb a manager\n\n381\n00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.860\nemail is one of the most effective\ntools that you will need to understand\n\n382\n00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:35.110\nas you start working more and\nmore in the world of computer technology.\n\n383\n00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.730\nAnd the reason why is like what I've\nsaid at other points in our series here,\n\n384\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.520\nit is the life blood of communications\nthat tend to go on inside of companies,\n\n385\n00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.150\nand that is because we can\nalways send an email and\n\n386\n00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.750\nensure that the message gets to\nyou as you create those accounts.\n\n387\n00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.870\nThe great thing about it is this,\ninside of a company when you first join,\n\n388\n00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.090\nyou do not really have to worry\nabout setting up the email itself,\n\n389\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.890\ncuz a lot of times your IT Support Team,\nthey will be there to help you and\n\n390\n00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.940\nunderstand what needs to be done, so\n\n391\n00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.770\nthat you can set that email account up, if\nyou're actually inside of an organization.\n\n392\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.560\nAnd once that's happening you will\nconnected to the system, and now that you\n\n393\n00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.220\nare connected to the system, you can\nstart sending and receiving emails.\n\n394\n00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.487\nThe client or the program or\napplication that Dr.\n\n395\n00:22:22.487 --> 00:22:26.820\nOmwansa was essentially showing us there,\nis one that's called Microsoft Outlook,\n\n396\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.840\nwhich actually is a very encompassing\nprogram to help us to communicate,\n\n397\n00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.520\nas well as manage calendars and\n\n398\n00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.890\ncontacts and different ways that we\ncan communicate with other people.\n\n399\n00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:41.730\nBut it's particular power, of course,\nis in managing all those emails.\n\n400\n00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.940\nThose emails generally come in and then\nwhen you need to send one they allow you,\n\n401\n00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.140\nof course, to send a message, and\n\n402\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.610\nyou can also send certain\nattachments if you need to.\n\n403\n00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.110\nThat way, if you have a file\nthat needs to go to Dr Tonny,\n\n404\n00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.860\nyou can say,\nhere's the file that Dr Tonny needs.\n\n405\n00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:02.880\nI send him an email,\nit gets to his computer, and\n\n406\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.880\nthen he can open up that attachment,\ndownload that file, and now it exists\n\n407\n00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.090\non his computer without you or I having\nto set up an additional structure.\n\n408\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.100\nThere's a size limitation and every\nsystem will be a little bit different.\n\n409\n00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.830\nNow the great thing, like I said,\n\n410\n00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.380\nis within a company you really do not have\nto worry too much about it, except for\n\n411\n00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.540\nwhat your company tells you\nyou need to be able to do.\n\n412\n00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.950\nSo take the time to take\na look at the email client\n\n413\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.990\nof whatever the actual software\nthat they've set you up with to do.\n\n414\n00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:37.368\nNow on a personal note though, if you're\ngoing to do this there are many companies\n\n415\n00:23:37.368 --> 00:23:40.107\nout that will allow you set\nup a free email account.\n\n416\n00:23:40.107 --> 00:23:45.862\nYou can do yahoo.com, and\nthey'll have an email or Gmail.\n\n417\n00:23:45.862 --> 00:23:47.700\nThese are very popular.\n\n418\n00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.930\nAOL mail, believe it or\nnot, is still out there.\n\n419\n00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:55.120\nEven thought that's been a long gone\nfrom a lot of the places on the planet.\n\n420\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.929\nBut you can go out there and\ntype in free email account and then see.\n\n421\n00:23:58.929 --> 00:24:02.449\nNow when they're free, a lot of times,\nyou also have to deal with the idea of\n\n422\n00:24:02.449 --> 00:24:05.584\nadvertisements, but your advantage\nis It doesn't cost you much,\n\n423\n00:24:05.584 --> 00:24:08.280\nyou just get advertisements\nevery once in awhile as well.\n\n424\n00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.660\nSo good thing is those are set up and\nthey're normally fairly intuitive.\n\n425\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.130\nEven those types of services though\ncan also connect to a client\n\n426\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.370\nlike Microsoft Outlook.\n\n427\n00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.080\nAnd that's because the protocols\nthat are working in the background\n\n428\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.410\nare really the same that you see.\n\n429\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.060\nAnd so there are a couple of generic\nprotocols that are used back there\n\n430\n00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.265\none called IMAP and\nanother one called POP3.\n\n431\n00:24:32.265 --> 00:24:34.880\nPOP3, which is Post Office Protocol.\n\n432\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.440\nAnd so you do have this technology that's\navailable to you and it is by far the tool\n\n433\n00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.830\nyou definitely want to make sure that you\nshould be able to master, it is intuitive.\n\n434\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.030\nWhen you need to send an email, you'll\nnormally see a big button that says, send,\n\n435\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.260\nit makes sense.\n\n436\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.210\nWhen you receive an email,\nit comes into your inbox and\n\n437\n00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.720\nyou just have to click on it and\nlook at it.\n\n438\n00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.310\nIt's not very technical for\n\n439\n00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.700\nus to do things like that, but\nit does require you though\n\n440\n00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.010\nto take a little bit of time to understand\nthat particular client that you're in.\n\n441\n00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:09.240\nBut besides that though, learning about\na system like this makes you very much\n\n442\n00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.360\na person that can actually learn about\neverything else we've talked about.\n\n443\n00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.480\nAnd if you're using Microsoft Outlook,\n\n444\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.860\nthe great thing is since in this series\nwe've also seen the use of Microsoft Word,\n\n445\n00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.970\nExcel and Access, you'll see that\nthe interface looks almost the same.\n\n446\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.780\nSo those skills there will\ntranslate even into something\n\n447\n00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.830\nlike Microsoft Outlook as well.\n\n448\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.860\n>> Exactly and that's a very great parting\npoint because what I've displayed right\n\n449\n00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:38.630\nnow on my screen is an example of\nsomeone composing an email, or\n\n450\n00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.530\nthey're actually replying to\nan email they may have received.\n\n451\n00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.880\nIf you look right up here at the tabs,\n\n452\n00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.720\nthey look exactly like what we find\nin Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel.\n\n453\n00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.060\nThe font, you can play around\nwith the font, you can format,\n\n454\n00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.510\nyou can right align, left align.\n\n455\n00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:01.180\nYou can do indenting, you can\nactually put things in bullet form,\n\n456\n00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:06.890\nyou can attach documents,\nyou can paste things, you can, whatever.\n\n457\n00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.780\nThere are so many things you can do,\njust like you could possibly do\n\n458\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.300\nin Microsoft Office,\nyou can zoom something etc.\n\n459\n00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.430\nSo right there, you got the option, you're\ndetermining from whom are you sending to,\n\n460\n00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.480\nsometimes you can change the email\nfrom whom you are sending to.\n\n461\n00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.750\nYou have the email address\nthat you're sending to.\n\n462\n00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:26.240\nYou can copy other people as well,\nand you can blind copy others as well.\n\n463\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.580\nSo there's normally an option for\n\n464\n00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:32.140\nBCC, which hides the person who\nis going to potentially receive.\n\n465\n00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.340\nIt may be necessary, you just want to\nsend some information to someone about\n\n466\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.860\nthe communication that is happening, and\n\n467\n00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.800\nyou don't want them to participate\nin that communication.\n\n468\n00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.710\nThen right in here,\nyou've got the subject matter.\n\n469\n00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.080\nIt's always a very good habit\nto put in the subject matter,\n\n470\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.900\nbecause subject helps people\nto know what to expect.\n\n471\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.560\nSometimes if you don't put a clear\nsubject, then people, maybe they have\n\n472\n00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.745\na lot of emails and they can just always\nsay, well, maybe this is not important.\n\n473\n00:26:57.745 --> 00:26:59.130\nBut when you put the subject,\n\n474\n00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.750\nget a snapshot, and get a aha, I think\nI should attend to this kind of email.\n\n475\n00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.500\nI need to read it and I need to\nrespond to it and stuff like that.\n\n476\n00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.790\nThen you can compose,\n\n477\n00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.200\nit's always a good idea to always\nstart an email professionally.\n\n478\n00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.940\nYou can say, dear so and so, I think\nit's a lot more personal than to say hi,\n\n479\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.380\nwhatever you want to.\n\n480\n00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.120\nIntroduce the subject,\n\n481\n00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.550\nthen put in the subject and conclude\nthe email with some kind of signature.\n\n482\n00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:30.470\nLike simply say sincerely, kindly,\nwhatever you're comfortable with.\n\n483\n00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.040\nIt's always a good habit to end email.\n\n484\n00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.710\nSo that's we will talk a little\nbit about the etiquette of\n\n485\n00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.030\nemail communication in that we\njust want to look professional so\n\n486\n00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:43.110\nthat because you are introducing\nyour stuff to someone and you\n\n487\n00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.010\nwant to participate in a communication you\nwant to send some communication to them.\n\n488\n00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:52.690\nYou want to make sure that you\nfollow a certain procedure.\n\n489\n00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:57.940\nPeople are giving you their\ntime to read whatever you send.\n\n490\n00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.160\nAnd so you want to make\nsure that the relationship\n\n491\n00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.978\nin the stage of communication\nis professional.\n\n492\n00:28:03.978 --> 00:28:06.670\n>> All right, Dr. Omwansa.\n\n493\n00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.860\nWell, taking a look at the idea of some of\nthe different ways that we can communicate\n\n494\n00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.230\nonline, especially focusing on email.\n\n495\n00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:16.700\nVery important task and very important\nskills that we need to actually understand\n\n496\n00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.080\nas we continue to move forward in our\ncareer in working with computers.\n\n497\n00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.280\nAny last parting words here on emails or\nany\n\n498\n00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.550\nof the other types of online communication\nthat we've been talking about?\n\n499\n00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.960\n>> There are many features that we could\npossibly use that we didn't talk about.\n\n500\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:39.220\nOne of them is, I mean a few minutes ago\nI just remembered, you can archive email.\n\n501\n00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.940\nYou can actually store email.\n\n502\n00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.600\nOr you can actually\ncreate the email system\n\n503\n00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.660\nto respond via emails\nwhen you are not there.\n\n504\n00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.830\nSo you can actually create,\nlet's say you've gone on holiday and\n\n505\n00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.000\nyou're not going to be available for\nsome time.\n\n506\n00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.520\nOr you're currently working somewhere and\n\n507\n00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.250\nyou're not going to be able\nto access email quickly.\n\n508\n00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.980\nSo you can create an auto response kind\nof email and you create a message and for\n\n509\n00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.930\nevery email that comes you should\nbe able to say the following,\n\n510\n00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.420\nbut Is gonna be between this time and\nthis time and\n\n511\n00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.460\nthen after that maybe I can\nundo that kind of thing.\n\n512\n00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.034\nSo I think it's worth spending time,\n\n513\n00:29:13.034 --> 00:29:17.942\nI think probably it is one tool as long\nas you have Internet connection and\n\n514\n00:29:17.942 --> 00:29:22.450\nyou want to utilize the power\nof communication using Internet.\n\n515\n00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:28.760\nI think it is one tool that we all need\nto spend time to understand and possibly\n\n516\n00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:34.470\nmaster, because it is such a powerful\nway of getting things done quickly.\n\n517\n00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.830\nCuz we rely on others,\nwe depend on one another, so\n\n518\n00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.960\nwe have to keep communicating, so.\n\n519\n00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.120\nMastering this tool and\nstrengthening our capacity to use it, not\n\n520\n00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:50.720\nonly does it make us more employable,\nit actually increases our productivity.\n\n521\n00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.920\nAnd then to a large extent, we get to do\n\n522\n00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.880\na lot more within much of the time even\nif we are walking with other people.\n\n523\n00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.871\n>> Excellent, well, thank you again Dr.\n\n524\n00:30:00.871 --> 00:30:05.230\nTony for helping understand a little\nbit more about online communications.\n\n525\n00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.780\nThank you also for watching us too.\n\n526\n00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.690\nGreat place for\nus to sign off right here for ITProTV.\n\n527\n00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.984\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n528\n00:30:12.984 -->

00:00:17.952\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\nand you're watching\n\n4\n00:00:17.952 --> 00:00:22.502\nthe Computing Fundamentals IC3 Show, where\nwe are continuing to take a look a little\n\n5\n00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:26.500\nbit about the Internet connection here and\ntalking about web basics.\n\n6\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.035\nAnd here to help us out to understand more\nof that is gonna be Dr. Tonny Omwansa.\n\n7\n00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:31.990\nDr. Tonny, welcome back to our studios.\n\n8\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.160\n>> Thank you very much for\nhaving me back here.\n\n9\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.290\nIt's exciting.\n\n10\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.674\nEvery time you start\nthinking about the web,\n\n11\n00:00:37.674 --> 00:00:41.720\nthen you see those\npossibilities of the web.\n\n12\n00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.048\nIt's great to be here and\nI look forward to a great show.\n\n13\n00:00:45.048 --> 00:00:49.110\n>> So Dr. Tonny, we've already talked\na little bit in a previous episode about\n\n14\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.740\nthe idea of Internet communications.\n\n15\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.930\nBut now, as we move into the realm\nof talking about the web itself,\n\n16\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.560\nwe're not talking about webpages, and some\nof the different things that go on there,\n\n17\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.270\nand how we actually can interact\nwith them a little bit.\n\n18\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.240\nSo where are we going to begin?\n\n19\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.700\n>> Yeah, so we spent a little time\nthinking about email communication,\n\n20\n00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.720\nsocial media, and all that stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.902\nThat's only in the context\nof communication.\n\n22\n00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:19.125\nThere are many, many other things\nthat the Internet gets used for,\n\n23\n00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.375\nand many applications that\nare available in the Internet.\n\n24\n00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:26.425\nTherefore, it is important to understand\nthat foundation of how the web\n\n25\n00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:27.425\nactually works.\n\n26\n00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.835\nNow remember, we're talking about\nconnected computers, all right?\n\n27\n00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:34.194\nThat's the Internet, but then on top\nof it, now we're talking about the web,\n\n28\n00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.566\nthe World Wide Web, all right?\n\n29\n00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:41.030\nSo that's one application of\nhaving created a computer network.\n\n30\n00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.172\nAnd so thinking about the web, and when I\nthink about some of the basics of the web,\n\n31\n00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:48.680\none of the things we want to\nunderstand is it how is it made?\n\n32\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.910\nHow does it look?\n\n33\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.330\nWhat are the components\nthat make it all together?\n\n34\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.630\nAnd secondly, how does the web function?\n\n35\n00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.581\nWhen you think about web browsers,\nhow do they function?\n\n36\n00:01:58.581 --> 00:01:59.600\nHow do they relate?\n\n37\n00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.230\nAre there different types?\n\n38\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.208\nHow do they work?\n\n39\n00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:05.270\nIf I am looking for something on\nthe Internet, if you tell me there is\n\n40\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.560\na worldwide connection of different\ncomputers with different kinds of things,\n\n41\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.020\nif I'm looking for something out there,\nhow do I possibly find it?\n\n42\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.100\nAnd finally,\nI want to think about the security and\n\n43\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.790\nsome of the concerns that I should\nhave from a protection perspective,\n\n44\n00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.360\nbecause not everybody out\nthere is a nice person.\n\n45\n00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.560\nAnd not everything that is available\non the Internet is necessarily good for\n\n46\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.040\nme and for my computer.\n\n47\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.020\nIt can actually make my computer crash or\njust simply fail to function, or\n\n48\n00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.200\nutilize some of the resources\nthat I have here unfairly.\n\n49\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.260\nSo all those are things that we'll\nbe thinking about in this section of\n\n50\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.546\nweb basics.\n\n51\n00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:47.410\n>> Right, so Dr. Tonny, what we're just\nreally trying to make sure that people can\n\n52\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.130\ndo and understand is differentiate the\nidea that, one, we talk about the idea of\n\n53\n00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.480\nthe Internet itself as being\nan infrastructure that's there for us to\n\n54\n00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.850\nhave the connection, and the connectivity,\nand the communication that we need.\n\n55\n00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.440\nBut the other part of it normally is\ngonna be where we get content, and\n\n56\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.900\nthat's what the World Wide Web is about.\n\n57\n00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.890\nIt's normally where we go to\ncertain locations on the Internet\n\n58\n00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.620\nwhich have computers on them that will\nallow us to retrieve content off of that.\n\n59\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.040\nAnd they call it the World Wide Web\nbecause it is interconnected,\n\n60\n00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.480\nlike a spider web is interconnected,\nas well.\n\n61\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.768\nMany points to be able\nto get to one point, and\n\n62\n00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:26.731\nit allows us to be able to\nnavigate between those systems.\n\n63\n00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:27.866\nAnd normally, on those sites,\n\n64\n00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:30.215\nwe'll actually see that there\nare different components there.\n\n65\n00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:34.750\nSo when we take a look then\nabout the idea of browsing and\n\n66\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.241\nhow the web works, what are the three\nmain components we need to think about?\n\n67\n00:03:38.241 --> 00:03:40.404\n>> Now, that's interesting.\n\n68\n00:03:40.404 --> 00:03:44.646\nWhen you start thinking about all of these\nthings that sometimes you get to see on\n\n69\n00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:47.684\na browser, you need to\nunderstand what that browser is,\n\n70\n00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:51.125\nwhere is that content stored, and\nhow did it finally get to you?\n\n71\n00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:55.250\nSo the first component that you want\nto appreciate is the web server.\n\n72\n00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.440\nSo the content that sometimes\nyou get to see on a computer,\n\n73\n00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.390\nor even on your smartphone is\ncoming from some server somewhere.\n\n74\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.170\nThat's a specialized\ncomputer that is storing and\n\n75\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.820\nproviding content that will come\nto the websites for you to see.\n\n76\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.341\nThe second thing that you want to\nappreciate is the web browser.\n\n77\n00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:16.300\nAnd there are different\ntypes of browsers out there.\n\n78\n00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.580\nThere are some that are configured for\nmobile phones, for mobile devices,\n\n79\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.600\nfor computers, etc.\n\n80\n00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.030\nThey're the ones that enable\nyou to display something.\n\n81\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.270\nSo they are able to make requests\nto go and look for web content, and\n\n82\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.490\nthen display it for\nyou to see at your computer.\n\n83\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.160\nAnd the third thing is the web pages.\n\n84\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.970\nNow, think about the browser as a house,\nas a kind of a framework\n\n85\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.130\nthat can enable you to see different\nthings at different times.\n\n86\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.640\nSo you get to see a web page that is\norganized in a very nice way that is\n\n87\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.910\nintuitive, where you can easily move\naround and see different things.\n\n88\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.817\nBut these web pages could be coming\nfrom different storages, and\n\n89\n00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:56.460\nthose are the web servers.\n\n90\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.774\nThey could be coming from\ndifferent kinds of servers.\n\n91\n00:04:58.774 --> 00:05:00.162\nAnd at different times,\n\n92\n00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:04.063\nyour web browser is making a request\nto particular servers and getting\n\n93\n00:05:04.063 --> 00:05:08.170\nthe web page to come and be displayed\non the web browser where you are.\n\n94\n00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.230\nSo it means you actually have so\n\n95\n00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.830\nmuch power where you're sitting that\nyou can connect to many servers and\n\n96\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.110\nget to see different things\ndisplayed on the same browser.\n\n97\n00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.522\nThat means you're simply connected to so\nmany web servers.\n\n98\n00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:25.240\n>> There is no doubt that these\nare the basic components that we\n\n99\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.350\nneed to understand.\n\n100\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.860\nThere's gonna be a web\nserver that hosts for\n\n101\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.310\nus those web pages that is\nthe content that we tend to have.\n\n102\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.400\nAnd even though you might go to a single\nweb server for that page, those\n\n103\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.430\npages can be interconnected with other\nservers out there that will collate or\n\n104\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.400\npull together all the content that\ngets displayed on your screen,\n\n105\n00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.560\nwhich is gonna be displayed through\na web browser of some sort.\n\n106\n00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.300\nSo when we are a user, we normally\nhave a web browser on our computer or\n\n107\n00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.370\nour smartphone that allows us then\nto connect to that web server.\n\n108\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.580\nWhen we make that connection\nto the web server,\n\n109\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.195\nwe're normally also requesting that it\ngo and find that particular web page.\n\n110\n00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:11.480\nAnd a copy of that web page,\nthat content, gets retrieved and\n\n111\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.250\nsent over so\nthat I can see what I need to see.\n\n112\n00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.450\nNow, Dr. Tonny,\nwe also wanna mention a little bit, and\n\n113\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.470\nwe're not getting super\ntechnically in depth on it, but\n\n114\n00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.188\nhow in the world do we get access\nto those particular web pages?\n\n115\n00:06:23.188 --> 00:06:28.270\n>> All right, now, we're gonna get into\na little bit of depth in this case.\n\n116\n00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.980\nSo the web page, as we said,\nis the content that has been\n\n117\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.505\ncopied from some particular server and\nhas been displayed.\n\n118\n00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:38.890\nYou're not taking the content and\nnow storing it on your computer.\n\n119\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.050\nIt still remains there.\n\n120\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.558\nYou basically have a link\nthat now connects,\n\n121\n00:06:42.558 --> 00:06:44.607\nand you're able to see the content.\n\n122\n00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:48.310\nContent that is displayed\non your computer is,\n\n123\n00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.065\nto a large extent,\ndisplayed using a tool that is very easy.\n\n124\n00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:57.559\nAnd we're not going to go into\nthe details of how it works, but\n\n125\n00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:00.672\nit's called Hypertext Markup Language,\n\n126\n00:07:00.672 --> 00:07:05.773\nwhich is basically a language that is\ngoing to be used to encode data and\n\n127\n00:07:05.773 --> 00:07:10.282\ngraphics for the purposes of\ndisplaying it on your computer.\n\n128\n00:07:10.282 --> 00:07:11.423\nWe're talking about communication.\n\n129\n00:07:11.423 --> 00:07:15.607\nFor communication to take place, it takes\na certain language that different parties\n\n130\n00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:18.050\nin that communication get to understand.\n\n131\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.670\nSo at some point in time,\nyou'll get to see this kind of thing\n\n132\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.350\nabout Hypertext Markup Language\nthat is used to display content.\n\n133\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.285\nRight now, on my screen,\nI have displayed a simple page,\n\n134\n00:07:30.285 --> 00:07:33.080\nwhat a web page would look like.\n\n135\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.120\nOn it you can see some text is a little\nbit blue, and some is black, and\n\n136\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.670\nyou've got images, and you've got links,\nand different kinds of things.\n\n137\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.553\nNow, these things that are in blue are\nare links that are pointing you to other\n\n138\n00:07:44.553 --> 00:07:45.164\nweb pages.\n\n139\n00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:49.371\nWhen you click it, you are sending\na request to that server so\n\n140\n00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:52.517\nit can send you the content back,\nall right?\n\n141\n00:07:52.517 --> 00:07:55.271\nSo I'm gonna go to another section, but\n\n142\n00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:59.402\njust before we go to it we're\ngoing to start thinking about,\n\n143\n00:07:59.402 --> 00:08:05.050\nhow do we identify, how do you know what\nis being the question and where is it?\n\n144\n00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.491\nSo that's where we start\nthinking about an address.\n\n145\n00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:14.820\nAll these computers that are located in\nthe Internet have a unique identifier.\n\n146\n00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.276\nAt some point in time maybe you\n\n147\n00:08:17.276 --> 00:08:22.240\nin the episode where we talked about\nunique identifiers for databases.\n\n148\n00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.020\nSo everyone as we are here we have names.\n\n149\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.080\nRonnie that's your name.\n\n150\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.408\nYou've been Ronnie since you are,\nI don't know how old.\n\n151\n00:08:30.408 --> 00:08:31.900\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n152\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.680\n>> I've been Tonny for so long.\n\n153\n00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.130\nWell, I have an opportunity to change\nmy name, but it's a long process and\n\n154\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.110\nwhen I change my name then I have\nto have official documentation\n\n155\n00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.390\nthat reflect that change.\n\n156\n00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:47.541\nAnd I must show that I was Tonny before\nI became whatever name that I become.\n\n157\n00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:52.730\nSo that name has to always be retained so\nthat people know who was I before.\n\n158\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.750\nI can just all of a sudden change and\n\n159\n00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.010\nI'm a very nice guy when I was not\nthe very nice guy and things like that.\n\n160\n00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:04.290\nSo that unique identification of\npeople helps us to trace one another.\n\n161\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.110\nBut as you know, my name is not unique.\n\n162\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.190\nI just don't own that name.\n\n163\n00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.360\nSomeone else can also be called Tonny.\n\n164\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.990\nAnd so that can be a bit of a confusion.\n\n165\n00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.400\nMaybe you might somebody\nsomewhere called Tonny Omwansa.\n\n166\n00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.370\nAnd therefore, we're sharing the name.\n\n167\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:23.560\nSo we have to look for mechanisms of\nhaving something really unique about me.\n\n168\n00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.780\nThere are many things unique about myself\nof course the way I look is one thing.\n\n169\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.560\nI have a national ID and\n\n170\n00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.200\nI don't know anybody in Kenya\nwho has the same national ID.\n\n171\n00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.690\nBut maybe in another country there might\nbe someone with another national ID\n\n172\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.810\nthat looks the same, possible.\n\n173\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.520\nBut at the same time\nwe've got a passport and\n\n174\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.430\nI don't know if there's anybody in\nthe world who has a passport like me.\n\n175\n00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.000\nBut the other forms of identification,\nI can use finger prints,\n\n176\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.020\nthe iris and all that,\nmy DNA can be unique, etc.\n\n177\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:58.530\nSo the concept of unique identification\nis also very important and\n\n178\n00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.340\napplicable in the world wide web.\n\n179\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.280\nRemember we're talking about so\nmany computers.\n\n180\n00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:10.270\nThen even more interesting is that there's\nso many, so many websites out there.\n\n181\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.157\nAnd each of them somehow has to\nhave some form of identification.\n\n182\n00:10:13.157 --> 00:10:16.628\nThat brings us to the concept of IP,\n\n183\n00:10:16.628 --> 00:10:21.200\nthe protocol for identifying computers.\n\n184\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:27.400\nThat's IP addresses, as well as\nunderstanding uniform resource locators,\n\n185\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.520\nURL, which is a unique way\nof identifying a website.\n\n186\n00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.900\nSo every time I type something,\nit will always be that particular thing,\n\n187\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.270\nit will not point me to something else.\n\n188\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:43.170\nSo the IP address which is a protocol for\nnaming,\n\n189\n00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:49.255\nyou know computers that\nare within the network and\n\n190\n00:10:49.255 --> 00:10:52.675\nevery computer that comes on\nboard has some form of IP.\n\n191\n00:10:52.675 --> 00:10:55.525\nBut you and I don't get to worry\ntoo much how all that number,\n\n192\n00:10:55.525 --> 00:10:57.305\nyou know like I need to\nunderstand that number.\n\n193\n00:10:57.305 --> 00:10:59.215\nDon't worry about that.\n\n194\n00:10:59.215 --> 00:11:04.605\nIt's unique and in some cases it might\nbe a number that has been allocated\n\n195\n00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:09.940\nto that device dynamically or\nit has always been there, it is static.\n\n196\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.330\nSo, there are people who's job is\nto manage those IP addresses so\n\n197\n00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.960\nthat we are always sure that whatever\ndevice that is on the internet\n\n198\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.170\nhas the unique identification.\n\n199\n00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.210\nBut what could be of a lot\nmore interest for you and\n\n200\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.540\nme to understand is the concept of URL.\n\n201\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.420\nAnd right now on my screen,\nI have pointed to a simple URL.\n\n202\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.740\nAnd we're gonna use this URL\nto explain a simple logic\n\n203\n00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.650\nof how do we uniquely\nidentify the web page.\n\n204\n00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.670\nSo over here it starts with\na protocol which is HTTP,\n\n205\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.810\nthis hypertext transfer protocol is\na set of rules that govern how that\n\n206\n00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:55.210\ncommunication is going to happen in\nthe context of webpages and websites.\n\n207\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.170\nIt always ends with a full colon and\ntwo slashes,\n\n208\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.420\nforward slashes, and\nthen there is the domain name.\n\n209\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:07.410\nSo the domain name is simply\ngoing to point to a location that\n\n210\n00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.250\nhas the content for the website.\n\n211\n00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:14.700\nAnd the website will potentially\ncontain several web pages.\n\n212\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.940\nSo, as we spoke earlier on about exploring\nand file paths, and things like that.\n\n213\n00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.790\nHow do we trace specific\ndocuments in a computer.\n\n214\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.020\nWe are storing them in folders and\nfolders and file.\n\n215\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.450\nAnd then finally the files, and then\nthe file will probably have a file type.\n\n216\n00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.440\nSo, similarly, this domain name,\nwhich then will map onto some kind of IP\n\n217\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.180\naddress at some point, which is not really\nwhat we are worrying too much about.\n\n218\n00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.640\nBut, just like my name is unique to me,\nin this case, and\n\n219\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.580\nI have an ID,\nI don't need to flash around my ID.\n\n220\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.690\nEver since we came in this show,\nI haven't talked about my ID number.\n\n221\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.190\n>> No.\n\n222\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.939\n>> And I'm not sure you're very\nkeen about that ID number, either.\n\n223\n00:12:56.939 --> 00:12:59.510\n[LAUGH] All right, but\nI have to keep hiding it.\n\n224\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:04.130\nActually in my pocket was a passport,\nand it's got a passport number.\n\n225\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.500\nBut I don't keep talking about\nthe passport number, I talk about my name.\n\n226\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.910\nAll right, name is something that\nyou can very easily relate with.\n\n227\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.880\nBut there is a point in time where\nthe passport number will be needed.\n\n228\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.810\nSo where I give out this\npassport to someone else,\n\n229\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.340\nthey can match it to the name.\n\n230\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.660\nYeah yeah yeah, that's your number and\ntherefore that's your name,that's okay.\n\n231\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.800\nSo in this case,\nas is shown on my computer,\n\n232\n00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.130\nthe domain name kind of\nmaps onto the IP address.\n\n233\n00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.040\nLet's not worry too much about that.\n\n234\n00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.740\nAnd then once we've gotten to\nthe computer that actually stores that\n\n235\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:43.290\nparticular website, we need to find a path\nto the file that we want to display.\n\n236\n00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.311\nAnd that's where this path,\nwhich includes the filename, is.\n\n237\n00:13:46.311 --> 00:13:54.343\nSo news is a folder, and\nthe actual file is called story24871.htm.\n\n238\n00:13:54.343 --> 00:13:59.540\nNow, the .htm is telling me\nsomething about the file type.\n\n239\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:05.572\nAnd the file name is this whole\nstory all the way to .htm and\n\n240\n00:14:05.572 --> 00:14:08.810\nthe entire path can have more\nthan one folder and they will go.\n\n241\n00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.910\nSo if I check this line,\nwhich we call the URL, and\n\n242\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:18.370\nI paste it on the browser, it will\ngive me the content of that webpage.\n\n243\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.560\nNow, it is not up to you and\n\n244\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.260\nme to worry about how did we finally,\nyou know, where is that server located?\n\n245\n00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:29.350\nIt could be in the UK, US, South Africa,\nyou know whatever, that's not up to me,\n\n246\n00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.120\nthat's up to the computer network\nto worry about that one and\n\n247\n00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.860\nthe internet to worry about that one,\nbut I can get my content and\n\n248\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.770\nevery time, I create my own website,\nit will have the URL and\n\n249\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.280\nI don't worry too much about the IP\naddress, but there I go I have a webpage.\n\n250\n00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.790\n>> There is no doubt that one of\nthe things that really can boggle the mind\n\n251\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.420\nright at the beginning is understanding\nthat concept of uniqueness must occur,\n\n252\n00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.580\nif you're going to use the intranet\nto gain access to servers or\n\n253\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.410\nto computers that are out there, without\nthe uniqueness it means somebody else\n\n254\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.660\ncould, or you could end up\nat somebody else's website,\n\n255\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.130\nyou could end up on somebody else's\ncomputer that you do not mean to be.\n\n256\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.800\nSo there is a way to guaranty and\nto insure that you end up at the right\n\n257\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.240\nserver at the right time and\nthat is that combination of things here.\n\n258\n00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.600\nIt really begins where\nthat server has a basic\n\n259\n00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.380\nInternet address that\nwe call an IP address.\n\n260\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.068\nThat is going to be unique\nin the entire internet and\n\n261\n00:15:26.068 --> 00:15:28.693\nthen to make it easily\nreadable in the way that Dr.\n\n262\n00:15:28.693 --> 00:15:32.586\nTonny described it for us to be able\nto translate and for us to understand.\n\n263\n00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:36.591\nWe then, instead,\nattach that IP address to a name and\n\n264\n00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:42.686\nwhen you also attach a protocol along with\nthe domain name and the file path itself,\n\n265\n00:15:42.686 --> 00:15:47.412\nthat makes up that entire URL,\nthat uniform resource locator.\n\n266\n00:15:47.412 --> 00:15:49.278\nSo it is important that we know that,\n\n267\n00:15:49.278 --> 00:15:52.243\nbecause normally what we would\ndo with that information.\n\n268\n00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:56.347\nIs we would open our web browser and\nwe can either type it in or Dr.\n\n269\n00:15:56.347 --> 00:16:01.135\nTonny, I agree that probably the easiest\nthing to do is actually copy it and\n\n270\n00:16:01.135 --> 00:16:04.790\nthen paste it into the address\nbar in that browser.\n\n271\n00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.470\nAnd that will normally allow that\nbrowser to begin to search and\n\n272\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:13.380\ngo out and find that one particular\nlocation on the Internet that will\n\n273\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.250\nactually lead us to the web page,\nthat we are also looking for as well.\n\n274\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.600\nSo, there's a lot of different\nthings that come together\n\n275\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.480\nwhen you start talking about being\nable to get access to the web as well.\n\n276\n00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.340\nSo, Dr. Tonny, where do we need to\ngo from there now that we understand\n\n277\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.530\nthe basics of the URL and\nthe uniqueness of those locations?\n\n278\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:36.630\n>> Yeah, I mean there's so many things\nthat you could possibly learn about,\n\n279\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.170\nthink about,\nthe top-level domain names and\n\n280\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:45.122\nsometimes you see URLs\nthat are ending with .edu,\n\n281\n00:16:45.122 --> 00:16:49.290\n.com, .gov, whatever it will be.\n\n282\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:54.330\nSo that helps use to associate\ncertain webpages with certain things.\n\n283\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.680\nSo there are many other things\nthat we can learn about.\n\n284\n00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.480\nI think our next thing that we will want\nto talk about is the browser itself.\n\n285\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.120\nAnd let's try to get a few\nthings going on over there.\n\n286\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.670\nSo when you think about a browser,\nnow we already know what a browser is.\n\n287\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.860\nThe first question is,\nare there different types of browsers?\n\n288\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.670\nYes.\n\n289\n00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.880\nThere are many types\nof browsers out there.\n\n290\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.740\nYou can get Internet Explorer,\nMozilla, Firefox, you name them.\n\n291\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:24.050\nSo you can always explore, and see\nthey've got different strengths here and\n\n292\n00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.660\nthere, but, the general principle\nis pretty much the same.\n\n293\n00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:33.690\nSo we can just quickly say,\nwell I wanna open some kind of a browser.\n\n294\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:38.750\nOn my computer I have a few options\nthat I have opened already.\n\n295\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:47.420\nI had opened Mozilla Firefox, I had opened\nthe Google Chrome, and so preferences.\n\n296\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.690\nBut whenever you just need\nto go to Start button,\n\n297\n00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:54.150\nyou can easily access button\nhere at the status bar.\n\n298\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.690\nI've got Internet Explorer pointing at.\n\n299\n00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.240\nThey've got the Mozilla Firefox.\n\n300\n00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.180\nI've got Google Chrome.\n\n301\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.050\nSo, we just quickly open Google Chrome and\n\n302\n00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:07.260\nonce you get to see, what I've put\nup here is simply the browser and\n\n303\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.990\nI had opened email,\nusing Gmail as you can see up here.\n\n304\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.830\nThe URL for Gmail is right there.\n\n305\n00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:20.270\nIf I want to refresh, I can very easily\nclick Enter again and it can refresh.\n\n306\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.850\nI have several things.\n\n307\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.820\nNow the beautiful thing is, that there\nare tabs, and these tabs I think\n\n308\n00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:29.190\nthat we spoke about earlier on,\nthat you can use, to move around.\n\n309\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.630\nSo I can be working on different\ndocuments at different times,\n\n310\n00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.250\nthere is even opportunity\nto play some music.\n\n311\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.450\nI can check news, I have a drive,\n\n312\n00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:43.970\nI can check different folders\nthat I stored on the cloud.\n\n313\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.740\nAnd that's on the internet and therefore\nI can quickly move things up and down.\n\n314\n00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.200\nSo, the flexibility to do\ndifferent things does exist and\n\n315\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.180\nthat's one powerful thing about modern\nbrowsers that enable you not only to\n\n316\n00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.050\naccess only one file, you can actually\nbe doing different types of things.\n\n317\n00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.220\nSo, I deliberately opened\ndifferent things, so\n\n318\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.390\nthat you see that puts possibility.\n\n319\n00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:11.940\nYou started on, and then you can\nvery easily open different tabs.\n\n320\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.330\nAnd on each of those tabs, you can be\npointing to a different server somewhere.\n\n321\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.240\nSo I gave you illustrations.\n\n322\n00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.640\nI was looking at email, I was looking\nat files, I was watching a video,\n\n323\n00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.360\nI was reading news, and I was working\non a document that is actually on some\n\n324\n00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.380\nserver somewhere, and I'm collaboratively\nworking with two different people.\n\n325\n00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.147\nAnd I couldn't finish it, so\nI kind of stopped somewhere and\n\n326\n00:19:35.147 --> 00:19:37.330\nI went to check some news and\ndifferent things.\n\n327\n00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.744\nSo, my productivity can go very\nhigh as long as I manage myself and\n\n328\n00:19:40.744 --> 00:19:45.340\ndon't get over-excited about\nthe various possibilities, isn't it?\n\n329\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.270\nNow, as a window, like we said earlier on.\n\n330\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.500\nYou can minimize windows.\n\n331\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.430\nYou can maximize.\n\n332\n00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.490\nYou can resize, and you can close.\n\n333\n00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.230\nAnd so there you go,\nvery powerful tool, isn't it?\n\n334\n00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.760\n>> It really is.\n\n335\n00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.461\nIt's one of the things that we're\ndefinitely going to need to get used to,\n\n336\n00:20:00.461 --> 00:20:02.636\ncuz even within inside of an organization,\n\n337\n00:20:02.636 --> 00:20:05.748\na lot of the application that we\nuse are also web based as well and\n\n338\n00:20:05.748 --> 00:20:08.670\nyou're gonna need to use your\nbrowser to access them too.\n\n339\n00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:13.470\nNow Dr. Tonny, that's great if\nI know exactly what the URL is.\n\n340\n00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.720\nIn other words,\nif I know exactly where I'm going.\n\n341\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.740\nBut if I don't know and\nI just need to try and\n\n342\n00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.360\nfind it, there are also tools\navailable for us as well, right.\n\n343\n00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.080\nWe call them search engines, I believe.\n\n344\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.340\n>> Yeah, that's correct.\n\n345\n00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.370\nSome people have spent\nresources thinking about how\n\n346\n00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:35.020\ncan I help people to find something on the\ninternet, and they should think about it.\n\n347\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.417\nThere are so many servers out there,\nthere are so many websites, there are so\n\n348\n00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:43.150\nmany web pages, I can't even\nimagine how many there could be.\n\n349\n00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:49.280\nSo on my screen, I've simply placed an\nimage there that shows what would it take,\n\n350\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.610\nto search for something.\n\n351\n00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:58.898\nSo I kindly, illustrating how to\nsearch using Google search engine.\n\n352\n00:20:58.898 --> 00:21:02.880\nSo Google has made it very simple and\nif I go on to my browser right now and\n\n353\n00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.840\nI open a new tab, and\nI say Google.com, as an example.\n\n354\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.450\nSo it displays very simple image here.\n\n355\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.540\nAnd so simple, so straightforward.\n\n356\n00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.122\nAll I need to say, well,\nI want to search for\n\n357\n00:21:16.122 --> 00:21:19.296\n>> ITProTV.\n\n358\n00:21:19.296 --> 00:21:22.470\n>> ITProTV.\n\n359\n00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.970\nAnd then I say Enter.\n\n360\n00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.280\nEven before I Enter,\n[INAUDIBLE] all ready found it.\n\n361\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.180\nThis is really brilliant, wow.\n\n362\n00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:35.090\nAnd then all of a sudden, I've got several\nlinks that show me something about ITPro.\n\n363\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.420\nIt could be a webpage.\n\n364\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.830\nIt could be the Facebook page,\nthe YouTube page.\n\n365\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.140\nThe actual website does all ready come up.\n\n366\n00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:48.308\n>> And I can see about 2,070,000\nresults in 0.2 seconds.\n\n367\n00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:51.545\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wow, how did that happen, Ronnie?\n\n368\n00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:55.300\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, there are what we call,\nof course, companies that\n\n369\n00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.810\ndo these types of searches and\nthey have massive amounts of databases.\n\n370\n00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.664\nThat really send out, well,\nsoftware that goes out and tries and\n\n371\n00:22:02.664 --> 00:22:06.740\nfinds all these different webpages and\nthen it puts them into a list and\n\n372\n00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.090\ninstead we can go to those\ndifferent search engines then and\n\n373\n00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.650\ndo a search on their database\nbecause there are gigantic numbers,\n\n374\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:19.440\nhundreds if not thousands of computers\nout there that can return those results.\n\n375\n00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.300\nThey can do those searches very quickly\nand give us those results quickly as well.\n\n376\n00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.740\nSo Google is one of them that you can use,\nYahoo is another one, Bing is another one.\n\n377\n00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.620\nThere's multiple web search engines\nthat are out there that are built and\n\n378\n00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.790\ndesigned to help you, even if you\ndon't know exactly what the uniform\n\n379\n00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:44.460\nresource locator is gonna be or\nthe IP address to get to that webpage.\n\n380\n00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.100\nAnd this really does help you to\nbe able to do more productivity\n\n381\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.180\nas long as you know what\nyou're searching for.\n\n382\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.320\nNow if you don't,\nyou'll get a lot more results, so\n\n383\n00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.990\nthe key there is actually\nputting enough words in there\n\n384\n00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.880\nthat will help pinpoint what you\nneed to bring those results up.\n\n385\n00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.670\nBut they are one of the most\npowerful tools that you can use\n\n386\n00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.310\nif you'll take the time\njust to do that and\n\n387\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.490\njust simply go ahead and say,\nlet me try this combination and\n\n388\n00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.350\nthere is even help features that\nare available on a lot of these.\n\n389\n00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.310\nThat will help you to refine your\nsearch patterns a little bit better.\n\n390\n00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.270\n>> So there's tons of research.\n\n391\n00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.800\nIt is actually a lot more\ncomplicated than we described.\n\n392\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.490\nWe're basically giving hints.\n\n393\n00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:27.294\nIf you wanted to train so that you\ncan easily find whatever you need to\n\n394\n00:23:27.294 --> 00:23:31.763\nfind a lot more faster,\nthere are mechanisms for doing that but\n\n395\n00:23:31.763 --> 00:23:36.168\nwe'll have another opportunity\nto go into depth on that one.\n\n396\n00:23:36.168 --> 00:23:40.889\nIf you look right now on my screen,\nafter I searched for\n\n397\n00:23:40.889 --> 00:23:45.508\nITProTV, I have pointed at\nthe very end to the right,\n\n398\n00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:50.128\nI have pointed to A feature\nof the browser that enables\n\n399\n00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:55.238\nme to configure the browser\nto suit my needs even more.\n\n400\n00:23:55.238 --> 00:23:58.751\nSo don't think that just because the\nbrowser has been designed the way it is\n\n401\n00:23:58.751 --> 00:24:00.162\nyou can't change anything.\n\n402\n00:24:00.162 --> 00:24:04.196\nThere are opportunities there for\nadding tabs, windows,\n\n403\n00:24:04.196 --> 00:24:09.440\nlooking at the history, what is this I\nhave searched over the last few years,\n\n404\n00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.680\nor days, or whatever it may be,\nI can put a setting for it.\n\n405\n00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.170\nSo if I want rather than to search for\nsomething again, or for some reason maybe\n\n406\n00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.740\nthe computer went off and\nwhen I turn it on and I want to go back to\n\n407\n00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.530\nsome of the pages that I was searching\nearlier on, I can go to my history.\n\n408\n00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.260\nAnd it will display for me,\nI had been to Amazon shopping cart,\n\n409\n00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.870\nI was on email, and things like that.\n\n410\n00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.460\nIn addition, there are downloads.\n\n411\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.270\nEvery so\noften you wanna download something.\n\n412\n00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:43.001\nCould be a document, it could be\na video clip, it could be an image,\n\n413\n00:24:43.001 --> 00:24:44.338\nthings like that.\n\n414\n00:24:44.338 --> 00:24:46.196\nSo you can easily download things.\n\n415\n00:24:46.196 --> 00:24:50.401\nAnd we'll talk a little later about\ndownloading, you wanna be careful what you\n\n416\n00:24:50.401 --> 00:24:54.060\nalways download because not everybody\nout there is a nice person.\n\n417\n00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:58.850\nAnd some people position things and\nmislead, or\n\n418\n00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:04.870\nthey actually put software or applications\nthat could possibly damage your computer.\n\n419\n00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.980\nSo you want to be careful\nwhat you download.\n\n420\n00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.450\nBut if you want to look at what is\ndownloadable, you can check out there.\n\n421\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.290\nThere are bookmarks that sometimes you\nwant to point to specific pages that you\n\n422\n00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.340\nwant to keep on referring to.\n\n423\n00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.080\nYou can zoom the browser in and out.\n\n424\n00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.827\nAha, now I've actually\ndiscovered this one.\n\n425\n00:25:20.827 --> 00:25:24.264\nActually, you're the one who\nused the zoom awhile back and\n\n426\n00:25:24.264 --> 00:25:26.887\nI was wondering how did\nyou actually do that.\n\n427\n00:25:26.887 --> 00:25:28.960\nI've just figured it right now, okay.\n\n428\n00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So there you go and\n\n429\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.380\nyou can zoom the browser, you can print\nsomething that is on your browser right\n\n430\n00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.513\naway and it will send to the printer.\n\n431\n00:25:37.513 --> 00:25:43.041\nYou can search for\nsomething within that particular web page.\n\n432\n00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:47.797\nThere are many more other tools,\nyou can clear, for example,\n\n433\n00:25:47.797 --> 00:25:51.134\nthe content that has\nbeen stored over time.\n\n434\n00:25:51.134 --> 00:25:55.080\nThe other one that I like is the settings.\n\n435\n00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.990\nSo if I click the Settings,\nI have an opportunity to\n\n436\n00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.563\nconfigure the browser a lot more in\nterms of the way I want it to function.\n\n437\n00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.090\nWhenever I open a new page,\nwhat do I want to see?\n\n438\n00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.290\nWhenever I start the browser,\nwhat do I want to see?\n\n439\n00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.790\nWhat kind of things?\n\n440\n00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:15.210\nHow do I want it to look like\nevery time that I open it?\n\n441\n00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.568\nIf I want to search, what are the\ncharacteristics of the search do I want?\n\n442\n00:26:19.568 --> 00:26:24.881\nThen there are some advanced settings\nover here which enable me to connect\n\n443\n00:26:24.881 --> 00:26:30.656\nthis to the Internet and say, sometimes\nI might put some IP address there.\n\n444\n00:26:30.656 --> 00:26:35.640\nThat's the proxy setting for\nconnectivity in your own organization or\n\n445\n00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.030\nat home or whatever it be, or whenever\nyou've moved from one place to another,\n\n446\n00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.110\nyou may want to set.\n\n447\n00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:44.449\nThere's so many other things you could\nset to configure the browser to work more\n\n448\n00:26:44.449 --> 00:26:48.207\nconveniently and increase your\nproductivity depending on where you\n\n449\n00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:50.297\nare at, and make it more customized.\n\n450\n00:26:50.297 --> 00:26:51.872\n>> All right, so Dr. Omwansa,\n\n451\n00:26:51.872 --> 00:26:56.287\nthat's a pretty good overview of some of\nthe web basics that we need to understand.\n\n452\n00:26:56.287 --> 00:27:00.037\nThe basic components where we\ntalked about the web browser,\n\n453\n00:27:00.037 --> 00:27:04.130\nthe idea of using the web servers\nthat will host the content.\n\n454\n00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:08.550\nAnd of course, the webpages which normally\ndisplays for us the contents that we need.\n\n455\n00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:13.500\nWe also, of course, took a look at\nthe Uniform Resource Locator and how\n\n456\n00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.160\nthese things also are going to allow us\nto be able to go directly to those pages.\n\n457\n00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.200\nAnd then lastly, we also talked\nabout the different search tools and\n\n458\n00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.086\nsome of the browsers and\nthe features that are also in them.\n\n459\n00:27:24.086 --> 00:27:28.160\nSo, Dr. Omwansa,\nany last words here on the idea\n\n460\n00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.940\nof using the web browser to become\na little bit more productive?\n\n461\n00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:36.300\n>> Well, I think at this point we can just\ntalk about the little general things here.\n\n462\n00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.662\nThat as we use this tool,\nas powerful as it may be,\n\n463\n00:27:39.662 --> 00:27:43.520\nthere's certain limitations that it has.\n\n464\n00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:49.820\nAnd one of them that's very interesting\nis, you're responsible for what you got.\n\n465\n00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.524\nAll right, so it's like a library.\n\n466\n00:27:51.524 --> 00:27:55.927\nI mean, all this information is out there,\nsome of it has not been validated.\n\n467\n00:27:55.927 --> 00:28:00.586\nSome of it has not been reviewed,\nall right, so you can search for\n\n468\n00:28:00.586 --> 00:28:05.440\nsomething and say, I want to know\nhow to remove a tooth, all right?\n\n469\n00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.106\n>> Okay.\n\n470\n00:28:06.106 --> 00:28:09.790\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And then I go up there.\n\n471\n00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.280\nBy the way,\nlet me search just to demonstrate,\n\n472\n00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.740\nbecause this is serious business here.\n\n473\n00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:20.642\nSo I go there and I decide,\nwell, I'm going to go Google and\n\n474\n00:28:20.642 --> 00:28:27.630\nthen I'm gonna search about how to\nremove a tooth, yeah, and Enter.\n\n475\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.280\nWow, that's already actually shown me.\n\n476\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.910\nLook, there's even a clip,\nhow to remove a tooth painless.\n\n477\n00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:34.771\nWhoa!\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n478\n00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:36.710\n>> I hope that's good to be true.\n\n479\n00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:43.390\nNow, if you decide, I can see even\nWikiHow, Three Ways to Pull out a Tooth.\n\n480\n00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.831\nYou know how to pull\na rotten tooth at home.\n\n481\n00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:50.090\n>> Yes, [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There are all manner of ideas\n\n482\n00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.592\nhere.\n\n483\n00:28:50.592 --> 00:28:56.006\nNow the reason why we are laughing\nat what we are reading is that\n\n484\n00:28:56.006 --> 00:29:01.526\nwhoever put that content up there\nis not really responsible for\n\n485\n00:29:01.526 --> 00:29:05.738\nwhat happens when you\nactually decide to do it.\n\n486\n00:29:05.738 --> 00:29:08.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There is no commitment that if anything\n\n487\n00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.680\ngoes wrong [LAUGH] they will\ntake responsibility for it.\n\n488\n00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.760\nSo whatever you get online,\nwhether you're downloading documents,\n\n489\n00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:20.830\nyou're watching clips, you are getting\nan image, etc., and things like that.\n\n490\n00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.890\nAll those things are available, but\n\n491\n00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.290\nat the same time you have to be\nsure about what you're doing.\n\n492\n00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:31.440\nSo if you're quoting something, let's say,\nyou are student and you're extracting some\n\n493\n00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.116\ncontent there as part of your assignment,\nyou have to be sure about the source.\n\n494\n00:29:36.116 --> 00:29:40.150\nYou have to do your research, you have\nto be certain about what you're doing,\n\n495\n00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:44.249\notherwise you can plagiarize or\nyou can actually be misled.\n\n496\n00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.448\nOr you might probably not\nlink content very well,\n\n497\n00:29:49.448 --> 00:29:52.548\ndepending on what exactly you pick.\n\n498\n00:29:52.548 --> 00:29:57.275\nSo that is some little caution, and\nas much as we have all this content out\n\n499\n00:29:57.275 --> 00:30:01.471\nthere, there is a bit of caution\nas to how we appropriately use.\n\n500\n00:30:01.471 --> 00:30:05.816\nSo we'll have another episode\nsomewhere along the way where we'll be\n\n501\n00:30:05.816 --> 00:30:10.677\ntalking about ethical use of content,\nlegal issues, protecting yourself,\n\n502\n00:30:10.677 --> 00:30:14.510\nsafety and all that stuff, and\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n503\n00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:15.980\nBut we know for now,\n\n504\n00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:21.590\nthe important thing is that we now have\naccess to a very powerful resource.\n\n505\n00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:25.770\n>> All right, thank you, Dr. Tonny,\nfor helping us to understand the web\n\n506\n00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:30.050\nbasics here and taking a look at some\nof the different components of the web.\n\n507\n00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.418\nAnd hopefully, you feel a little more\nconfident about being able to work around\n\n508\n00:30:33.418 --> 00:30:36.195\nwith search engines and, of course,\nusing the browser as well.\n\n509\n00:30:36.195 --> 00:30:38.625\nWell, it's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n510\n00:30:38.625 --> 00:30:42.642\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n511\n00:30:42.642 --> 00:30:47.436\n>> And my name is Dr. Tonny Omwansa,\nappreciating together the web basics.\n\n512\n00:30:47.436 --> 00:30:52.509\n>> All right, so stay tuned right here for\nmore computing fundamentals.\n\n513\n00:30:52.509 --> 00:31:01.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.551\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:21.300\nyou're watching\nthe Computing Fundamentals IC3 show.\n\n5\n00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.960\nWe're about to talk about\nthe concepts of security and privacy,\n\n6\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.170\nespecially on networks and Internet.\n\n7\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.874\nAnd who better to help us out\ntoday than Dr. Tonny Omwansa.\n\n8\n00:00:32.874 --> 00:00:34.940\nDr. Tonny, welcome back to our studios.\n\n9\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.915\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n10\n00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:40.030\nI've been here several times,\nso it's a familiar ground, and\n\n11\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.670\nit's an interesting topic to\ntalk about now, security and\n\n12\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.280\nhow do we got ourselves to\nmake sure we don't lose data,\n\n13\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.810\nwe don't get hot and\nwe stay positive in the use of technology.\n\n14\n00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.080\n>> It is one of those concepts that\nwe have to actually think about\n\n15\n00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.620\nbecause a lot of times when we\nstart working with computers\n\n16\n00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.080\non a daily basis the functionality\nbecomes almost intuitive.\n\n17\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.250\nThe use of applications, again, become\nmore intuitive as we work with them.\n\n18\n00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.140\nBut there is a whole realm\noutside of that that\n\n19\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.740\nnow that we are in part\nof a connected world and\n\n20\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.980\na society that we have to think about\nthe concepts of security and also privacy.\n\n21\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.805\nAnd we have to actually understand at\nleast some of those things that we're\n\n22\n00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:27.930\ngonna encounter because we start\nunderstanding that there are always\n\n23\n00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.030\nconstantly people trying to get access to\nboth the idea of breaking through security\n\n24\n00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.368\nboundaries that exist as well as\ngetting access to our privacy.\n\n25\n00:01:35.368 --> 00:01:39.740\nSo Dr. Tonny, where's a great place for\nsomeone that is really just beginning\n\n26\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.780\ntheir particular work and life into the\nworld of computing, where should we begin?\n\n27\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.660\n>> Right, I think just as\nyou rightly put it, Ronnie,\n\n28\n00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.250\nthe first place to start is to understand\nand appreciate that there are risks.\n\n29\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.070\nAnd there are concerns out there and\nwe're not always safe.\n\n30\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.140\nWe've opened up ourselves to the rest of\nthe world, looking for opportunity out\n\n31\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.010\nthere, but not everybody out there\nis having your interests at heart.\n\n32\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.110\nAnd therefore you have to\nknow how to protect yourself.\n\n33\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.660\nSo in this session, we'll think a little\nbit about the basics of computer security.\n\n34\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.210\nTry to understand how do\nwe secure our computer, and\n\n35\n00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.620\nhow do we secure ourselves\nwhen using the computer?\n\n36\n00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.080\nThat also happens when you think\nabout what kind of threats\n\n37\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.487\nare possible in computer networks.\n\n38\n00:02:28.487 --> 00:02:32.320\nThere's some kind of\nsoftware that can hurt us or\n\n39\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.850\ncan hurt the computers that we're using.\n\n40\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.905\nThinking about what is the importance\nof that personal security,\n\n41\n00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:40.070\nhow critical it is.\n\n42\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.960\nIt is not just about the computer, but\nalso even the way we use the computer.\n\n43\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.010\nThink about, we're using our fingers,\nour eyes interacting with the computer.\n\n44\n00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.840\nWhen we sit down, our back, the way\nthe posture, the sitting positions, and\n\n45\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.610\nthings like that.\n\n46\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.173\nThe amount of light that\ncomes on to our eyes,\n\n47\n00:02:56.173 --> 00:03:00.227\nthe kind of reflections that come on\nto the screen and things like that.\n\n48\n00:03:00.227 --> 00:03:02.885\nSo that's what we are gonna spend our\ntime on, on this particular session.\n\n49\n00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:07.050\nAnd we hope that you will learn\na few things that can help improve\n\n50\n00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.110\nyour security, the specific\nstrategies that you can apply,\n\n51\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.296\nto make your work environment safer for\nyou.\n\n52\n00:03:13.296 --> 00:03:16.800\n>> So Dr. Omwansa, when we first start\nthinking about this idea of computer\n\n53\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.610\nsecurity, we tend to try and\n\n54\n00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.800\nlook at security in the rest of our\nlives and find analogies to help us out.\n\n55\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.940\n>> Yeah.\n>> Security for most of is, right,\n\n56\n00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.645\nis the idea of keeping things\nprotected that we need to.\n\n57\n00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:28.280\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But\n\n58\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.670\nwhen it comes down to\nworking with computers,\n\n59\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.510\nwe may not exactly\nunderstand where we begin.\n\n60\n00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.929\nAnd so a lot of times what we have to\nactually think about are some of the goals\n\n61\n00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:38.780\nof security.\n\n62\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.809\nAnd so Dr. Omwansa,\n\n63\n00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.594\nwhere is it that we need to understand\nwhat the goals of security normally are?\n\n64\n00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:46.059\n>> All right, so broadly speaking,\n\n65\n00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.904\nwhen you wanna think about the security\nof your data or yourself, or\n\n66\n00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:55.930\nother people, your infrastructure,\nyou think about three things.\n\n67\n00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.240\nYou think about confidentiality,\nyou think about integrity and\n\n68\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.530\nyou think about availability.\n\n69\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.350\nLet's think about each of those terms,\n\n70\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.390\nI'll just probably start\nwith confidentiality.\n\n71\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.100\nSo is your data or information or\nsoftware or whatever confidential?\n\n72\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.770\nThat means only accessible to\nthe people who should access it and\n\n73\n00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.240\ntherefore possibly do whatever they're\nauthorized to do with that software.\n\n74\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.990\nYou don't want people to access\ncontent that they shouldn't, so\n\n75\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.460\nis it confidential?\n\n76\n00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.500\nAnd secondly,\nthe integrity of that content.\n\n77\n00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.240\nSo if it is data, if it is software.\n\n78\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.020\nAre you sure that nothing has been\nchanged in that particular content?\n\n79\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.020\nWherever you store it, wherever you\nkeep it, is it what it should be, or\n\n80\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.520\nhas it been manipulated?\n\n81\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.990\nRemember, that if we change one\nsingle character in a large document,\n\n82\n00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.140\nthen the integrity of that\ndocument is potentially comprised.\n\n83\n00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.259\nThe sad thing is availability.\n\n84\n00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.957\nPeople want to access things,\nwhen they should and how they should.\n\n85\n00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:03.032\nSo if for any reason they can't\naccess when they need it,\n\n86\n00:05:03.032 --> 00:05:05.864\nthen there's something\nabout that availability.\n\n87\n00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:09.716\nAnd many things can cause\nunavailability of software or data or\n\n88\n00:05:09.716 --> 00:05:12.070\neven just a simple computer.\n\n89\n00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.000\nIf I change the password on the computer,\nthen you can't access it,\n\n90\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.880\nthen it's no longer available to you,\njust as simple as that.\n\n91\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.180\nIt could be software that you already\nhave there, it could be data,\n\n92\n00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.560\nit could be something stored in another\ncomputer, and it's not available for\n\n93\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.040\nmechanical reasons, software reasons,\nlogical reasons or even simply locked.\n\n94\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.570\nA building is locked,\nthen it's no longer available to you.\n\n95\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.080\nSo those are the goals that we start\nthinking about that data or whatever it\n\n96\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.314\nmay be is available, is of good integrity,\nand it's confidential if it should be.\n\n97\n00:05:45.314 --> 00:05:48.940\n>> Dr. Omwansa, this is something that's a\nvery important concept as we start getting\n\n98\n00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.200\nto work with computers everyday,\n\n99\n00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.700\nbecause a lot of times we may not\nunderstand why the measures that are put\n\n100\n00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.180\nin place that seem to be restrictive\nto us when working on computers.\n\n101\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.160\nAnd the whole goal behind that with\ncompanies is that every time a company\n\n102\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.505\nimplements a security measure,\nespecially with computers,\n\n103\n00:06:07.505 --> 00:06:10.940\nit's designed with these\nthree goals in mind.\n\n104\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.786\nDoes it keep the data confidential?\n\n105\n00:06:12.786 --> 00:06:17.208\nDoes it help us with our data integrity,\nmaking sure nobody manipulates or\n\n106\n00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:20.449\nchanges our data,\nunauthorized changes to our data?\n\n107\n00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:25.184\nAnd of course, is it going to remain\navailable to me while I actually\n\n108\n00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:28.280\nhave the connection to have what I want.\n\n109\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.147\nAnd of course, also by default then,\ncan I ensure that it's not available\n\n110\n00:06:33.147 --> 00:06:37.490\nto those that are not authorized\nto actually see that data as well?\n\n111\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.004\nSo do not think about security measures\nas being a hindrance to the things\n\n112\n00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:44.830\nthat you're doing on a day to day basis.\n\n113\n00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.150\nIf they implemented a policy that\nsays here's how you must do it,\n\n114\n00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.650\nthey are following it because\nthey have goals in mind and\n\n115\n00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.400\nevery security implementation that\nthey tell you is about security,\n\n116\n00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.160\nis designed to help us to\nachieve those three goals.\n\n117\n00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.760\nNow the reason why we have to do so\nis that there are many different threats\n\n118\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.760\nthat you and\nI may encounter on a day to day basis,\n\n119\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.207\nespecially when we are connected to\nnetworks and the Internet as well.\n\n120\n00:07:09.207 --> 00:07:13.250\nDr. Omwansa, tell us about some of\nthese different types of threats.\n\n121\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.330\n>> We've got numerous types\nof threats out there.\n\n122\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.502\nI mean, the list is really long but\nyou're gonna have to learn some of them.\n\n123\n00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:24.230\nYou will get to interact\nwith some of them.\n\n124\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.366\nSome of them will come your way.\n\n125\n00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:31.072\nWe may not talk about all of them right\nnow, but if you have certain principles,\n\n126\n00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:34.655\nthey can guide you to be cautious,\nas you observe anything,\n\n127\n00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:38.120\nand you easily can think about\nwhat possibly you could do.\n\n128\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.630\nBut anyway,\nwe're gonna just demonstrate a few.\n\n129\n00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.850\nSo phishing is one of them.\n\n130\n00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.850\nLook, there are people out there who have\nan interest in getting your password, or\n\n131\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.080\nyour user name, or\nyour bank account details.\n\n132\n00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.102\nAnd you know what?\n\n133\n00:07:53.102 --> 00:07:55.673\nThey won't come with a gun and\ntry to scare you so\n\n134\n00:07:55.673 --> 00:07:57.487\nthat you give them the password.\n\n135\n00:07:57.487 --> 00:07:59.338\nOf course,\nthere's some people who can do that.\n\n136\n00:07:59.338 --> 00:08:03.109\nBut there are people out there\nwho intelligently doing it or\n\n137\n00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:06.882\nthey acquired a software that\ncan intelligently do that and\n\n138\n00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:10.290\nsomehow get information\nabout you passing details.\n\n139\n00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.880\nAnd then it can be used in other ways that\nyou're not necessarily comfortable about.\n\n140\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.640\nNow right on my screen I have actually\ndisplayed a very simple image.\n\n141\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.940\nThe image that I've\ndisplayed here is an email.\n\n142\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:32.137\nSomeone just received\nan email from whatever man.\n\n143\n00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:35.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> .com [LAUGH].\n\n144\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.300\nIt has a date, it's sent to you.\n\n145\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.720\nIn this case it's been sent\nto some email address here.\n\n146\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.160\nAnd the subject of the email is,\nYour Apple account has been frozen.\n\n147\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:53.360\nAnd the email goes, dear customer,\nyou've placed your Apple ID under a risk\n\n148\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.390\nof termination by not keeping your\ninformation up to date, on and on and on.\n\n149\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.770\nAnd then there's a link asking you to\nprovide your Apple ID and password,\n\n150\n00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.750\nso things can be rectified and then,\ntowards the end, it says, woah.\n\n151\n00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.610\nFor more information,\nsee your frequently asked questions,\n\n152\n00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.550\nthank you, Apple Customer Support.\n\n153\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:19.130\nNow, if you are not careful,\n\n154\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.590\nyou can release your information\nto someone or some people or\n\n155\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.709\nsome software out there that doesn't\nhave your interest at heart.\n\n156\n00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.740\nTrust in me,\nthis email has nothing to do with Apple.\n\n157\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.670\nIf you look at that email\naddress from where it's coming,\n\n158\n00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:40.250\nthe domain name, the email address itself,\n\n159\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.450\nthe website that has been used in there,\neven the signature down there.\n\n160\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.740\nThere are many things that are not\ncorrect, they are not true, bad.\n\n161\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:56.510\nThe email has been designed to\ntrick you to feel like you're safe.\n\n162\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.120\nAnd you should be, it is in your interest\nthey are asking you for that information.\n\n163\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.140\nAnd then you go ahead and submit it and\ninvite yourself to a lot of trouble, why?\n\n164\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.820\nBecause they take your details, there is\nnot commitment to help you in any way.\n\n165\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.120\nAnd that your details get used\nby someone else out there or\n\n166\n00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.070\nsome you know,\nsome software get to use that information.\n\n167\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.530\nAnd then probably your account gets\nhacked, things get changed out there,\n\n168\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.490\nand you're the one who lost.\n\n169\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:29.230\nAnd nobody takes responsibly for you\nbeing hacked because you simply submitted\n\n170\n00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.690\nthe information through the wrong person.\n\n171\n00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:37.020\nIt is not Apple that wrote you and\nthis is one example where you really\n\n172\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.780\nneed to be alert every time you receive\nand email asking for personal information.\n\n173\n00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.940\nIDs, usernames, addresses, phone number,\nyou've got to counter-check.\n\n174\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.250\nBe sure that what you're\ngetting is genuine.\n\n175\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.490\nThey might pretend that it's a bank\nthat is reaching out to you.\n\n176\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.700\nThey might pretend your school\nis reaching out to you.\n\n177\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.450\nSo, you have to check\nthe source of the email.\n\n178\n00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.010\nYou have to check that the URL is correct,\n\n179\n00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:07.540\nbecause you must be knowing the URL\nof the bank where you probably bank.\n\n180\n00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.100\nYou must think about the grammar,\nthink about the spellings,\n\n181\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.200\nsome of the ones that I used\nthat are actually not correct.\n\n182\n00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.270\nSomeone might say Apple\nprobably didn't put double p.\n\n183\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.350\nAnd it's just maybe one p,\nthings like that.\n\n184\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.270\nAlso, try to check the presence\nof a security padlock\n\n185\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.490\nicon normally on the address.\n\n186\n00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.910\nThere's normally a sign\nthere of a padlock.\n\n187\n00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.450\nThat gives you a second sense\nthat this is a secure website, so\n\n188\n00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.200\nwhenever you are sending information.\n\n189\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.890\nThat information will be secure,\nthat it will be encrypted and\n\n190\n00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.620\nit just can't be intercepted.\n\n191\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.480\nThat will give you a little\nbit of caution but\n\n192\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.570\nit doesn't always guarantee you\nthat it will always be safe.\n\n193\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.730\nAnd so those are some of the things\nthat you need to think about especially\n\n194\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.048\nwhen we talk about fishing.\n\n195\n00:11:50.048 --> 00:11:55.310\n>> And Dr. Omwansa I know one of the keys\nhere also is the very fact that when\n\n196\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.330\nyou work in a company is very easy the\nthing that every single piece of email.\n\n197\n00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.580\nThat you receive is something important,\nwhere there's actually gonna be\n\n198\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.060\na lot of email that you\nreceive that's not important.\n\n199\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.359\nAnd any one of these could be this\ntype of fishing attack that Dr.\n\n200\n00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:10.240\nOmwansa was talking about.\n\n201\n00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.080\nSo you wanna be careful with all those\nthings that Dr. Omwansa was talking about.\n\n202\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.493\nAnd also make sure that if somebody says,\n\n203\n00:12:18.493 --> 00:12:24.358\nhere's the attachment you were\nexpecting to receive, if you did not.\n\n204\n00:12:24.358 --> 00:12:28.240\nIf you said, I don't remember that\nsomebody is going to send me something in\n\n205\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.350\nan attachment, do not go ahead and\nclick on anything in that email.\n\n206\n00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.990\nAutomatically here, if it actually even\nseems like the email is from a coworker.\n\n207\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.580\nMake sure you verify that\nthey sent you that email\n\n208\n00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.155\nbecause they can even do\nsomething that we call spoofing.\n\n209\n00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:46.270\nNow they can your\ncoworkers email address and\n\n210\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.310\nit looks like that they sent it to you and\nthey really didn't send it.\n\n211\n00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.200\nAnd then you click on whatever that\nlink is, whether it's a link or\n\n212\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.440\nwhether it's an attachment and starts to\nrun computer programming on your computer.\n\n213\n00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.300\nGiving them, bad guys,\nthe access to your computer.\n\n214\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.130\nSo you always wanna make sure, and\n\n215\n00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.970\nthe easiest way is to simply pick up\nthe phone and call, or to actually go and\n\n216\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.720\ntalk to the person and say, did you\nsend me something with an attachment?\n\n217\n00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.170\nIf you weren't expecting it,\nif it's not from someone you know,\n\n218\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.870\ndo not click on those links and\nthat will help prevent a lot of it.\n\n219\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.950\nAnd this is normally, you might be\nwondering why does this happen so\n\n220\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.740\noften, because they are expecting\nyou to automatically do it.\n\n221\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.040\nIt becomes second nature because you're\nworking with a computer that you just\n\n222\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.500\nclick on every email and you don't think\nabout it and you click on the link and\n\n223\n00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.020\nthat's when they get you.\n\n224\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.960\nSo it's a very deceptive way that\nthey work because everything else\n\n225\n00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.650\nalmost looks normal and seems like it\nis something that you should do but\n\n226\n00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.560\nif you're not expecting it,\ndo not open it.\n\n227\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.630\nAnd that is one of the easiest ways to\nget rid of it actually just deleting it\n\n228\n00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.858\nis also another one too.\n\n229\n00:13:50.858 --> 00:13:55.930\nNow Dr. Omwansa we need to talk about\nthe idea of what I was just mentioning.\n\n230\n00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.610\nAnd what you also mentioned\nis that sometimes that URL\n\n231\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.210\nyou might expect it to actually\ngive you the name of the company.\n\n232\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.400\nBut you see it and\nit's actually something else there, and\n\n233\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.780\nbut the webpage looks exactly the same as\nthe concept that we call spoofing, right?\n\n234\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.620\n>> That's true and you know spoofing\nis another technique that people\n\n235\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.680\nuse to manipulate, you know,\nyou don't assume that.\n\n236\n00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.450\nAs I used an illustration where you\ncan people with the same name, but\n\n237\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.230\ntheir ID is different.\n\n238\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.390\nSo you know people can\nintercept content and\n\n239\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:33.010\ngive you links that almost look the same,\nas the original companies.\n\n240\n00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:37.250\nThat can get you into a lot of trouble\nbecause you will end up submitting, I have\n\n241\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:42.730\nseen a scenario where a website looks\nalmost the same as the original website.\n\n242\n00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.730\nThe URL looks almost the same,\nbecause you know we're quickly moving and\n\n243\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.840\ntrying to type out stuff and\nall of a sudden,\n\n244\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.570\nyou just discover that information\nis going to different address.\n\n245\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.800\nNot only do we have such kind of\nchallenges, we've got things like sniffing\n\n246\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:03.220\nthink about it, we spoke about data\nmoving through the network in packets.\n\n247\n00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.510\nAnd it has source address and\ndestination address.\n\n248\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.520\nAnd they can take different routes and\n\n249\n00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.180\nget reconstructed as it\narrives in to the destination.\n\n250\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.800\nThe people who created software\ncan actually intercept,\n\n251\n00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.450\nlook at the kind of data that is\nmoving around, try to reconstruct.\n\n252\n00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.240\nTry to understand exactly\nwhat is happening, and\n\n253\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.340\nthey can get your details very easily.\n\n254\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.860\nSo that's why we have those kind\nof virtual private networks.\n\n255\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.860\nThat's why we have secure websites so\nthat as data is moving around, and\n\n256\n00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.160\nas much as people can very easily\ncreate applications and software.\n\n257\n00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.290\nThat can tap some of those details,\nyou are not necessarily in danger.\n\n258\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.290\nOf course not everything on\nthe internet is going to be secure.\n\n259\n00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.028\nYou know, we kinda expect that one, and\n\n260\n00:15:49.028 --> 00:15:51.494\nthat's why we say the internet\nis not necessarily safe.\n\n261\n00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:56.986\nNow, if you have data that is\nnot necessarily sensitive,\n\n262\n00:15:56.986 --> 00:16:02.718\nit's not classified,\nit's not personal, too personal.\n\n263\n00:16:02.718 --> 00:16:04.538\nThat you can send and there's no problem.\n\n264\n00:16:04.538 --> 00:16:08.028\nJust like now,\nI'm talking about this conversation and\n\n265\n00:16:08.028 --> 00:16:10.370\nthere's nothing secret about this.\n\n266\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.460\nNow we're talking about this and\nthat's okay.\n\n267\n00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.870\nIt can be in the public domain.\n\n268\n00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.870\nBut not everything should\nbe in the public domain.\n\n269\n00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.380\nAnd therefore for that reason, you wanna\nbe careful when you are sending it out.\n\n270\n00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.090\nThere are others forms of\nattacks like password cracking.\n\n271\n00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.700\nSome people ask encrypted applications and\n\n272\n00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.350\nare using technology that they\ncan use to guess your password.\n\n273\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.000\nI'll give you an example.\n\n274\n00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.720\nI can actually guess a password.\n\n275\n00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.960\nBecause I tend to think that some people\nwill use their mother's name, sister's\n\n276\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.980\nname, uncle's name or their second name or\nthey might combine some of their names.\n\n277\n00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.590\nAnd then from there I can\nalmost guess their password.\n\n278\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.500\nOr I can just come to your desk and I can\ninstall an application that just kind of\n\n279\n00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.748\nlike tracks the keys that you\npunched over there, the keylogger.\n\n280\n00:16:54.748 --> 00:16:57.758\nIt's called a keylogger and it can come\nin software form or hardware form.\n\n281\n00:16:57.758 --> 00:17:00.480\nAnd [INAUDIBLE] send\nan application to your computer.\n\n282\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.731\nAnd then it installs itself depending\non what exactly you click and\n\n283\n00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:07.110\nthen from there as you type,\nI get the sense of the keys that you used.\n\n284\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.430\nOr I put a hardware device\non your computer and\n\n285\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.340\nit can actually capture the details\nof what exactly you're typing.\n\n286\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.960\nFrom there, I can almost tell what your\npassword is and the username may be easy.\n\n287\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.040\nBecause sometimes you get to\nsee usernames very easily and\n\n288\n00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.230\neven when you send me an email,\nI can know what your username is.\n\n289\n00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.832\nBut passwords are a little harder, so\nI can use a mechanism to check your\n\n290\n00:17:27.832 --> 00:17:31.455\ndetails or I can use what\nthey call social engineering.\n\n291\n00:17:31.455 --> 00:17:35.235\nAnd social engineering,\nI can just come and befriend someone,\n\n292\n00:17:35.235 --> 00:17:40.280\nsomebody just comes and see's this is a\nnice person, we've been working together.\n\n293\n00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.920\nSo and so\nneeds this kind of information from you.\n\n294\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.630\nI think it will be a great deal if we\njust collaborate, my password is this.\n\n295\n00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.210\nMaybe you can also give me yours and\nthings like that.\n\n296\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.970\nOr someone calls you and\nsays you know what,\n\n297\n00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.960\nI am the personal assistant to your boss\nand we need the following information.\n\n298\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.900\nCould you please provide\nthe following information?\n\n299\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.290\nSocial engineering is another way that\npeople use to get people's passwords.\n\n300\n00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.030\nSniffing, as we mentioned earlier,\npassword cracking tools.\n\n301\n00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.820\nThere are some software there that can\njust try just very hard once they get some\n\n302\n00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:14.185\nlittle data that maybe compressed or\nencrypted.\n\n303\n00:18:14.185 --> 00:18:18.445\nAnd they run some algorithms there\nto try and crack that password.\n\n304\n00:18:18.445 --> 00:18:22.695\nNot everybody out there is a good friend,\nso you have to be careful.\n\n305\n00:18:22.695 --> 00:18:25.567\n>> There is no doubt, Dr. Omwanza,\n\n306\n00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:31.223\nthat the idea here of losing your\npassword is kind of very easy to do.\n\n307\n00:18:31.223 --> 00:18:34.651\nEspecially if you happen to share\nthat password accidentally by\n\n308\n00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:38.960\njust talking too loud sometimes or\nsomebody looking over your shoulder.\n\n309\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.520\nAnd seeing you type it in,\nso you need to be careful.\n\n310\n00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.640\nNever share your passwords is one of\nthe key things that you can do, but\n\n311\n00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.230\nalso changing your passwords\nregularly on a regular basis.\n\n312\n00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.120\nInside of a business network,\nthe great thing a lot of times is that\n\n313\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.470\nthe company will have you change\nthe password every so often.\n\n314\n00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.010\nOne day you'll come in and you log in and\n\n315\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.670\nwe'll tell you, your password is\nexpiring today or is about to expire.\n\n316\n00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.030\nWould you like to change the password now?\n\n317\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.520\nIt is always recommended that you\ngo ahead and change that password.\n\n318\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.490\nAnd that way, if somebody did end\nup compromising your password,\n\n319\n00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.508\nhopefully the change of it will make\nthat more challenging for them.\n\n320\n00:19:15.508 --> 00:19:16.500\nNow Dr. Omwanza,\n\n321\n00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.790\neven though we have these picker\ntypes of threats that we worry about.\n\n322\n00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.800\nThe other ones that are more\npopularized by movies and\n\n323\n00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.330\narticles are things like viruses,\nworms and trojans.\n\n324\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.050\nWe know we're not getting into\nthe technical depth of every one of them.\n\n325\n00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.660\nBut can you just give us\na brief description of each and\n\n326\n00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.982\nhelp us to differentiate them?.\n\n327\n00:19:37.982 --> 00:19:41.950\n>> The term for\nthat kind of stuff is malware and\n\n328\n00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.690\nsomebody coined that malware\nbecause it's malicious software.\n\n329\n00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:51.380\nSo let's take mal and with ware,\nso put together you have malware.\n\n330\n00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.420\nThis is just kind of software\nthat has been created.\n\n331\n00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.090\nIt is dangerous, it is malicious,\nit is meant to cause harm.\n\n332\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.110\nAnd it comes in various forms.\n\n333\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.720\nWe spoke about viruses and the viruses\n\n334\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.295\nis just a type of malware that can attach\nitself into an executable software.\n\n335\n00:20:08.295 --> 00:20:12.237\nAnd then as the software moves around,\nit is also moving around.\n\n336\n00:20:12.237 --> 00:20:15.298\nAnd then when you click something,\nit runs and\n\n337\n00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:18.720\nthen it can possibly do\nall manner of things.\n\n338\n00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.360\nIt can just be as simple as just make\nsure your keys don't type properly.\n\n339\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.880\nYou type one and\nyou find you have typed nine.\n\n340\n00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.920\nAnd then you try to delete, you find\nyourself adding another character over\n\n341\n00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.680\nthere and then it just becomes a nuisance.\n\n342\n00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:39.760\nOr all of a sudden it's shutting\nthe computer, or the mouse is,\n\n343\n00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.510\nyou click something and you just discover\nthat it is just blinking or whatever.\n\n344\n00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:49.450\nIt could be just a little nuisance, but\nit can be more complicated than that and\n\n345\n00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.810\neven more harmful.\n\n346\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.590\nIt can delete applications.\n\n347\n00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.960\nIt can delete files.\n\n348\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.150\nYou can just find all of a sudden,\nthere's nothing in your flash disk.\n\n349\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.720\nIt can affect the operating system and\n\n350\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.788\nall of a sudden your computer just doesn't\nboot the way it was supposed to boot.\n\n351\n00:21:05.788 --> 00:21:10.210\nWorms are another type of malware and\nworms, just like viruses,\n\n352\n00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.480\nwill cause similar harm.\n\n353\n00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.050\nIt could be just as simple as just\na disturbing thing on the screen or\n\n354\n00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:22.120\nbut as much as wiping\nout your whole computer.\n\n355\n00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.800\nIt can be that bad and so\nit can be very, very costly.\n\n356\n00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.920\nThe ones even have the capacity to\nspread themselves to other computers\n\n357\n00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.080\nthrough the network.\n\n358\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.370\nAnd therefore, you wanna make sure\nthat you have the tools that can\n\n359\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.220\nhelp you to protect yourself from that.\n\n360\n00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.580\nTrojan is another example.\n\n361\n00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:45.150\nIt's just another term that demonstrates\nhow tricky people can become,\n\n362\n00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.340\ncreating software that is malicious.\n\n363\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.370\nIt just looks harmless, probably\ncame as an email, as an attachment.\n\n364\n00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.250\nAnd then it can have detrimental\neffect on your computer.\n\n365\n00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.790\nIt could look like a simple video clip.\n\n366\n00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.120\nIt could just look like\na very interesting movie.\n\n367\n00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.980\nIt's probably labeled African music.\n\n368\n00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.110\nAnd if you are interested in\nAfrican music, then I go whoa,\n\n369\n00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.260\nI just want to play this.\n\n370\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.410\nLingala is one type of African music.\n\n371\n00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.070\nAnd then some of the famous\nartists out there.\n\n372\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.588\nYou just might find you're interested in\nplaying that and then all of a sudden,\n\n373\n00:22:20.588 --> 00:22:23.340\nyou've caused a lot of\nharm to your computer.\n\n374\n00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.760\nAnd for that reason, you want to make\nsure you got the tools that somehow\n\n375\n00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.020\ncan help you get out of\nthat kind of trouble.\n\n376\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.490\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt\nthat these types of software,\n\n377\n00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.890\nthey can gain access to our\ncomputers in many different ways.\n\n378\n00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.760\nBut you do need to be aware of them.\n\n379\n00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.880\nThat idea that Dr.\nOmwanza told us about the virus,\n\n380\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.250\nit normally has to attach\nitself to another file.\n\n381\n00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.620\nAnd normally that means that we have\nto do something with that file and\n\n382\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.690\nthat's how it begins its process\nof affecting our computer.\n\n383\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:51.420\nThe trojan,\n\n384\n00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.880\nit can find its way into our system if we\nare connected into a network by itself.\n\n385\n00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.110\nIt doesn't need your help or mine, it can\njust work on its own, it's self-contained.\n\n386\n00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:05.370\nAnd that Trojan is actually meant to\ndeliver the harmful content by itself.\n\n387\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:09.250\nAnd today, the most active type of Trojans\nthat we are starting to see growing and\n\n388\n00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.820\ngrowing is something\nthat's called ransomware.\n\n389\n00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.040\nWhere it gets onto your computer and\nthen it encrypts your entire hard drive.\n\n390\n00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:22.160\nAnd it demands you to pay money to get the\ndecryption key when you actually get it.\n\n391\n00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.270\nSo you gotta be careful around\nthese types of software.\n\n392\n00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.046\nSo, this is why it's very important, Dr.\n\n393\n00:23:28.046 --> 00:23:30.930\nOmwanza, that we run things\nlike anti-virus software.\n\n394\n00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.640\nThat helps us to hold the line against\nthis type of software, all right?\n\n395\n00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:41.100\n>> Right, as the name suggests,\nanti, virus, against the virus.\n\n396\n00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.570\nMaybe it should have\nbeen called anti-malware.\n\n397\n00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:44.250\n>> Yeah.\n\n398\n00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.490\n>> Something like that, right?\n\n399\n00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:50.931\nSo that it can give us a sense that it's\nreaching out to all types of malware.\n\n400\n00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:56.499\nBut there are different kinds\nof software out there whose\n\n401\n00:23:56.499 --> 00:24:01.835\npurpose is to identify,\nintercept Block, disable,\n\n402\n00:24:01.835 --> 00:24:07.990\ndelete, they can do different\nkind of things to malware.\n\n403\n00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.560\nAnd antivirus is one such powerful tool.\n\n404\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.800\nIt's a little bit strange, that maybe some\npeople might spend a lot of time creating\n\n405\n00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.390\nviruses, and then they can get\nan opportunity to get an antivirus.\n\n406\n00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.100\nI don't know,\nmaybe it might be happening out there.\n\n407\n00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.130\nBut there are antivirus'\nthat you can purchase.\n\n408\n00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.550\nSymantec is one of them,\nKaspersky, McAfee, etc.\n\n409\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.020\nSo there are types of tools out\nthere which you can purchase.\n\n410\n00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.150\nThere are other free ones\nthat are reasonably good, and\n\n411\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.500\nat least they can give you\na reasonable degree of protection.\n\n412\n00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.620\nAVG is one of them.\n\n413\n00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.380\nYou can download it for free, and\n\n414\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.280\nit may have some limited features that\nenable you to protect your computer, and\n\n415\n00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.260\nyou can even have the option of\npurchasing the full version of it.\n\n416\n00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:58.490\nAnd that gives you some protection for\nyour computer.\n\n417\n00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.760\nThe way basically that antivirus will\nwork, you'll have an opportunity to run\n\n418\n00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.940\nand scan the entire computer or\nscan specific drives.\n\n419\n00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.450\nSometimes you may have some feature that\nwhenever you're downloading something\n\n420\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.230\nover the internet, it'll scan it\nautomatically before you open it.\n\n421\n00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.290\nAnd it can give you warning.\n\n422\n00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.330\nYou can program it to run on\na regular basis on your computer, so\n\n423\n00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.820\nthat it all constantly checks for\n\n424\n00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:28.326\nanything that could possibly have come to\nyour computer that is potentially harmful.\n\n425\n00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:33.340\nAnd the point is that the software has\nbeen created having known various kinds of\n\n426\n00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:40.190\nmalware that exists out there,\nit can just identify them automatically so\n\n427\n00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.170\nyou don't need to worry too much about,\nare you sure you'll figure out?\n\n428\n00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.355\nHow did you figure out what it is?\n\n429\n00:25:46.355 --> 00:25:48.660\nBut, that's what those companies do.\n\n430\n00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:54.070\nThey spend a lot of their effort trying to\nharvest as much as possible of the types\n\n431\n00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.990\nof malware that exist, and they can\nmatch very clearly to figure out ah-hah,\n\n432\n00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:02.710\nthis is exactly what this particular\nmalware can do and its features.\n\n433\n00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:08.160\nAnd then from there you can delete it or\nit can just be, put in a separate folder\n\n434\n00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.010\nsuch that it doesn't have the capacity\nto do anything onto your computer.\n\n435\n00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:16.950\nAnd these companies spend a lot of\ntheir effort always refreshing and\n\n436\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.450\nupdating the software, because as it\nis malware will continue to grow.\n\n437\n00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.350\nPeople are always gonna be creating\n\n438\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.110\nsome crazy software that could\npotentially hack people's computers.\n\n439\n00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.150\nAnd they could not for different reasons.\n\n440\n00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.860\nPeople want credit because just\nas you said, run somewhere.\n\n441\n00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.800\nThey are probably trying to\nmake some money out of it.\n\n442\n00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.700\nOr some people are just malicious,\nthey just want to hurt you.\n\n443\n00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.910\nThey just want to hurt or\n\n444\n00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.210\nthey just want to feel strong like\nthey can really shake things around.\n\n445\n00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.760\nSo motives are different.\n\n446\n00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.020\nAnd that's for, whatever others\nare doing it, for academic reasons.\n\n447\n00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.050\nThey are just trying to investigate\nwhat are the capabilities.\n\n448\n00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:56.000\nAnd some viruses get out there by\naccident, others are deliberate.\n\n449\n00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.270\nBut at least antivirus will give you\nthe opportunity to protect your computer,\n\n450\n00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:05.340\nand you should make sure that as\nlong as you are going to copy things\n\n451\n00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.450\nonto your computer from other computers,\nor you're gonna connect your computer to\n\n452\n00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.780\nthe internet, be sure you've got\nan anti-virus on your computer.\n\n453\n00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.385\n>> There's no doubt that the idea of\nrunning any type of security software like\n\n454\n00:27:17.385 --> 00:27:19.900\nanti-viruses is a big part of security.\n\n455\n00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.960\nWhen you're working for a business,\nmore than likely that business will have\n\n456\n00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.770\npurchased enough licenses to actually have\nevery single computer on their network,\n\n457\n00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.000\nevery end user work station,\nto run some type of antivirus.\n\n458\n00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.380\nAt home Dr. also told you about free\nversions that you can normally get.\n\n459\n00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.450\nAnd everyday you want to make sure\nthat you just allow it to update and\n\n460\n00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.610\nallow it to do the scans that it needs to.\n\n461\n00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.130\nNow Dr.Moju even though we've\ntalked about some of these\n\n462\n00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:47.490\ndifferent types of malicious software and\nsome of the more common\n\n463\n00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:51.110\ntypes of things that we're talking\nabout was social engineering,\n\n464\n00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:55.510\nthere are some times though that the\nattack happens a little bit differently.\n\n465\n00:27:55.510 --> 00:28:00.081\nThat what they do instead for a company is\nthat even though everybody can work, they\n\n466\n00:28:00.081 --> 00:28:05.400\ncan't gain access, let's say, to a server\nthat they need to, to get the information.\n\n467\n00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.870\nAnd so we want to talk a little bit about\nthe idea of denial of service attacks.\n\n468\n00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.740\n>> Yeah, denial of a service, DOS.\n\n469\n00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.870\nJust think about it.\n\n470\n00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:18.280\nI can come and lock the building when you\ngo home, I change the padlock, when we\n\n471\n00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.310\ncome tomorrow morning to the office,\nyou can't just access the building.\n\n472\n00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.600\nSo I've denied you access, all right?\n\n473\n00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.590\nAnd same thing can happen\non computer networks.\n\n474\n00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.380\nBecause, we know that the server there,\nor the memory and\n\n475\n00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.490\nthe CPU have certain capacities, and\nright, they can handle so many concurrent\n\n476\n00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:41.950\naccess requests, if so many people\nare making requests to that computer, at\n\n477\n00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:47.450\nsome point in time its functionality and\ncapacity will probably start coming down.\n\n478\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.481\nSo if I want to cause a little harm,\n\n479\n00:28:49.481 --> 00:28:53.054\nmaybe I think somebody has a very\nsuccessful in the website,\n\n480\n00:28:53.054 --> 00:28:57.555\npeople coming up, I'd like to find out,\nhow much can that website handle?\n\n481\n00:28:57.555 --> 00:29:01.516\nSo the next thing I would do is\nthat I will create a program that\n\n482\n00:29:01.516 --> 00:29:06.257\ncan simultaneously access that software\nto a point that it just doesn't\n\n483\n00:29:06.257 --> 00:29:08.430\nseem to function very well.\n\n484\n00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.170\nAnd then when legitimate\nusers come after that,\n\n485\n00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.350\nthey're struggling to access the system.\n\n486\n00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:18.040\nSo denial of status can happen\ndeliberately, where people\n\n487\n00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.500\ncreate software and probably that software\nspreads itself all over the internet, and\n\n488\n00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.080\nthen at some point in time, these all\ntriggered from a different location to\n\n489\n00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.530\naccess that particular website,\nand then it starts to shut down.\n\n490\n00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:34.940\nIt could be a website, it could be\na server, it could be a computer.\n\n491\n00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.950\nPeople can just start to utilize\nthe resources on your own computer\n\n492\n00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.390\nwhere the applications that are making\nrequests to your computer, and\n\n493\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.770\nall of a sudden the computer starts\nto function a little poorly so\n\n494\n00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.880\nthat's denial of service and\nit comes in different form.\n\n495\n00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:54.140\nBy the way it could be that people\nare genuinely accessing your website\n\n496\n00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.380\nbecause of demand that has been generated\nand then all of a sudden new people who\n\n497\n00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:03.100\nare trying to access that same website or\nresource can't seem to access it anymore.\n\n498\n00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:08.010\nThat's a form of denial of service so,\nit can happen.\n\n499\n00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:08.580\n>> Yeah.\n\n500\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.730\nWhen we start taking a look at that\ndenial of service, the legitimate versus\n\n501\n00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:17.310\nthe illegitimate denial of service, both\nof them are bad for your computer systems.\n\n502\n00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.900\nIt can actually happen because let's\nsay Dr. got on national TV and\n\n503\n00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.860\nsaid I want you to go to my website right\nnow, and everybody for one reason or\n\n504\n00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:30.557\nanother at the very exact same moment,\ndo this and they go, and now they're all\n\n505\n00:30:30.557 --> 00:30:35.090\ntrying to connect to Doctor server at\nthe same time, and now a new person says,\n\n506\n00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.800\nI'm a little bit late, I'm five seconds\nlate, and he can't gain access anymore.\n\n507\n00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.770\nWell, that's a denial service\nof that new person, but\n\n508\n00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.715\nthe malicious ones are the ones\nwe also worry about as well,\n\n509\n00:30:44.715 --> 00:30:47.858\nin which somebody says,\nI'm going to do this on purpose.\n\n510\n00:30:47.858 --> 00:30:52.340\nSo that Dr. Amwaza can't get his\ninformation out that he needs to and\n\n511\n00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.280\nhe instead, makes thousands,\n\n512\n00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.340\nif not hundreds of thousands of\nillegitimate requests to the website.\n\n513\n00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.930\nAnd even though,\nthey're making that connection,\n\n514\n00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.410\nit denies everybody else the resources\nto get access to it, and\n\n515\n00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.380\nsometimes they do this by taking over\nother computers on the internet.\n\n516\n00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.320\nAnd when you hear that,\nthat term is what we call a Zombie or\n\n517\n00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.670\na, and what we also call a botnet,\nas well.\n\n518\n00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.500\nSo when somebody else takes over the\ncomputer and they use it for their purpose\n\n519\n00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.340\nand I do not know about it if you\ntake over my computer, it's a zombie.\n\n520\n00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.790\nBut then when we act\ntogether in conjunction, and\n\n521\n00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:28.430\nlet's say that that attacker\nuses multiple zombies then,\n\n522\n00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:31.620\nthey consider that what\nthey call a botnet, also.\n\n523\n00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.960\nSo we do have to worry about that as well.\n\n524\n00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.976\nNow one of the other favorite attacks of\npeople that are trying to gain access,\n\n525\n00:31:38.976 --> 00:31:41.485\nunauthorized access to your network is\n\n526\n00:31:41.485 --> 00:31:46.440\nto also take a look at the wireless\nnetworks that are out there and available.\n\n527\n00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.718\nAnd this is actually a fairly\neasy attack because sometimes we\n\n528\n00:31:49.718 --> 00:31:52.431\nactually implement security\non wired networks and\n\n529\n00:31:52.431 --> 00:31:55.972\nforget about the idea of implementing\nsecurity for the wireless.\n\n530\n00:31:55.972 --> 00:31:59.002\nSo Dr. Owansa,\nwhat do we need to know here?\n\n531\n00:31:59.002 --> 00:32:01.944\n>> In that case, as ordinary users, we,\n\n532\n00:32:01.944 --> 00:32:07.116\nyou don't need to know that not all\nWiFi signals that we easily access\n\n533\n00:32:07.116 --> 00:32:12.950\nthrough either our phones or\nour computers are necessarily safe.\n\n534\n00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:17.250\nJust now displayed something on my screen\nthat, you know, gives you an indication of\n\n535\n00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:21.818\nassuming you went somewhere out there and\nyou've got, you know, wireless signals.\n\n536\n00:32:21.818 --> 00:32:26.015\nSo, yes, WiFi has been created, and\nthere are different types there.\n\n537\n00:32:26.015 --> 00:32:31.310\nYour names are in there, you know,\nand normally people create IDs and\n\n538\n00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:34.650\nnames for\nthese signals based on their preferences.\n\n539\n00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.070\nThat's fine.\n\n540\n00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:40.720\nAnd some of them are available to\nthe public, while others are secured.\n\n541\n00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.620\nYou will see an exclamation\nmark in some of them.\n\n542\n00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.700\nThat gives you a sense\nthat they are protected.\n\n543\n00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.480\nThey are secure.\n\n544\n00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.600\nBut then if you get one that is not,\nand you see.\n\n545\n00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.990\nIt's easily to access,\nyou know, I can connect and\n\n546\n00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:01.610\nI can send my details, I can access,\nyou know websites, etc.\n\n547\n00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.430\nThere you are,\nyou are inviting potential trouble.\n\n548\n00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:08.380\nSo, not always all open signals are safe.\n\n549\n00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:13.320\nSome of them, actually, sincerely are\nfine, but then some of them have been set\n\n550\n00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:18.800\nup to actually trick you to provide\ninformation that could possibly harm you.\n\n551\n00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.680\n>> Yeah, when we start taking\na look at a wireless network,\n\n552\n00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.970\nthere's many different things that can go\non, but most people just set it up and\n\n553\n00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.800\nsay, this will at least\ngive me wireless access.\n\n554\n00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.890\nThe problem is, even though you might\nconnect, there may be someone that is\n\n555\n00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.450\nlooking to gain access to your information\nthat might be able to connect to that very\n\n556\n00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:38.490\nsame network and gain access as well, even\nthough you don't intend for them to do so.\n\n557\n00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:43.370\nSo you can set up some basic security\nfeatures on the wireless access to help\n\n558\n00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.610\nout, to do so.\n\n559\n00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:48.430\nNow, we're not getting into the standards\nright now, but overall though,\n\n560\n00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.630\njust realize that there\nare security features and\n\n561\n00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.060\nyou do want to take a look\nat some of those features.\n\n562\n00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.580\nAnd some of them range, of course,\nfrom oldest protocols to newer protocols.\n\n563\n00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.240\nAnd what you have to\nrealize then at that point\n\n564\n00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.390\nis you can set those up\ndepending on your need.\n\n565\n00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.380\nIf you have old computers that\nare connecting in, you may not be able to\n\n566\n00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:10.880\nactually, to use the newest and latest\nsecurity features that are available.\n\n567\n00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.210\nBut if they need to gain access you\ngotta do some type of security.\n\n568\n00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.380\nSo you want to make sure that you\nset up those protocols as well.\n\n569\n00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.527\nAnd give them the access that they need.\n\n570\n00:34:20.527 --> 00:34:25.640\nNow, Dr. Owansa, I'm starting to actually\nsee that we've got a bit more to cover,\n\n571\n00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.560\nbut I think we're actually out of time.\n\n572\n00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.750\nSo it looks like we're gonna come back for\na part two here.\n\n573\n00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.280\n>> Yeah, we could come back for part two.\n\n574\n00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.100\nIt really depends on how far\nwe wanna go into the details,\n\n575\n00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.330\nbut I think one way we\ncould actually handle this,\n\n576\n00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:44.940\nwe can summarize some of the things that\nare within this section about what you\n\n577\n00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.800\ncould possible do to\nstrengthen your network.\n\n578\n00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.340\nThere are laws in different\ncountries that are used for\n\n579\n00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:56.260\nprotecting consumers and\ntheir solutions, but\n\n580\n00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.960\nthen at the same time, at personal level,\nthere are some things you can do.\n\n581\n00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.150\nYou can restrict access to your computer.\n\n582\n00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.470\nYou can check that whenever there\nare cookies on your computer,\n\n583\n00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.290\nthat you could possibly delete.\n\n584\n00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.710\nBecause they occupy,\n\n585\n00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:15.160\nthey hold data about your transactions\nthat you may have done on the internet.\n\n586\n00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:20.698\nEvery so often, you should form\na habit of changing passwords.\n\n587\n00:35:20.698 --> 00:35:24.890\nBecause people, either they could have\nsniffed or they could have just seen, or\n\n588\n00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:28.530\nthey could have used search engineering\nand somehow gotten your details.\n\n589\n00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:34.640\nSo like, form strong habits and try to\nchange them as often as you possibly can.\n\n590\n00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.820\nEvery time you get out of your computer,\nwhether you are in a cyber cafe and\n\n591\n00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.460\nyou are using social media and\nyou need to get out.\n\n592\n00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.630\nForm a habit of logging out.\n\n593\n00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:47.880\nTry to make sure that you don't\nleave your account running.\n\n594\n00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.990\nIf you have to physically get\nout of your personal computer,\n\n595\n00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.390\nthere is an option of\nlocking your computer.\n\n596\n00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:58.190\nSo you could easily go to the Start button\nand just next to the Shut down menu,\n\n597\n00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:01.720\nthere is the option for\nlocking down your computer.\n\n598\n00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.080\nAnd that way, people don't have\naccess to what you're doing.\n\n599\n00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.120\nThere are many other things you could do,\nlike setting up firewalls, and\n\n600\n00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.040\nyou could,\nif you don't know how to do that,\n\n601\n00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:15.400\nyour network configuration team\ncan give you thoughts about that.\n\n602\n00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.270\nYou can learn about encryption\nof content when it's being\n\n603\n00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:23.620\nsent from one place to another,\nhow do I ensure that data is safe.\n\n604\n00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:28.970\nYou can begin to think about how do\nyou protect data before it's lost.\n\n605\n00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:33.610\nTry as much as possible to back\nup your data, because if anything\n\n606\n00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:37.730\nhappens to your computer, you want to\nmake sure that you have some copy.\n\n607\n00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.210\nBacking up is a great,\ngreat habit to protect yourself.\n\n608\n00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:45.800\nAnd always make sure that\nyour computer is up to date.\n\n609\n00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.300\nEvery so often, your operating\nsystem needs to get updated.\n\n610\n00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.590\nYou want to make sure that your\ncomputer is up to date, so that\n\n611\n00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.990\nif there are any things that have changed\nout there, you're somehow protected.\n\n612\n00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:01.120\nSo we'll give you this as an opportunity\nto go further and explore, and look\n\n613\n00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.900\nat some of these terms, and how they apply\nin your context, so that you feel safe.\n\n614\n00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.780\nAll right, Dr. Owansa.\n\n615\n00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.900\nLooks like we didn't really need a part\ntwo, so that's actually a good thing for\n\n616\n00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.820\nus as well.\n\n617\n00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.970\nBut do take some time here to take a look\nat some of the network security and\n\n618\n00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:19.050\ninternet security features\nthat we've been talking about,\n\n619\n00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.170\nas well as understand\nthe idea of privacy here.\n\n620\n00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.150\nYou have to always guard yourself and\n\n621\n00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:28.700\nyour company is always guarding its\nparticular information as well.\n\n622\n00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.670\nSo when you're working inside of\na company, even though the majority of\n\n623\n00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.780\nthe responsibility will not be yours\nin terms of setting everything up,\n\n624\n00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.330\nit is your responsibility on\nthe things that you tend to do.\n\n625\n00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:43.270\nThe idea of making sure\nyou check your emails.\n\n626\n00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:47.840\nMaking sure, of course, that you are not\nfalling for the social engineering.\n\n627\n00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.210\nMaking sure, of course, that you are being\nresponsible when you see things like\n\n628\n00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.540\nthe phishing attacks and\nall these other things as well.\n\n629\n00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.920\nA lot of times, when you're inside of a\nbusiness, what's gonna end up happening is\n\n630\n00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.790\nthat your particular support team will\nbe doing the majority of that for\n\n631\n00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:06.930\nyou, but there are gonna be things\nthat are gonna be your responsibility.\n\n632\n00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.970\nAnd you're going to be part of that team,\nas well.\n\n633\n00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.830\nAnd so you'll get instructions\nthat are on what exactly to do and\n\n634\n00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.410\nwhat not to do, too.\n\n635\n00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.350\nSo make sure you do pay attention.\n\n636\n00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.870\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n637\n00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.650\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your Host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n638\n00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.380\n>> And my name is Dr. Tonny Owansa,\n\n639\n00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:30.190\nhaving spent time together learning about\ninternet security and computer security.\n\n640\n00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:32.823\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore computing fundamentals.\n\n641\n00:38:32.823 --> 00:38:39.062\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.250\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.695\nyou're watching\nthe Computing Fundamentals IC3 Show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:24.490\nWhere we're about to talk about\nseveral different topics,\n\n6\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.930\nthat as we work with computers they\nmay not seem very computer related.\n\n7\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.350\nBut they are really going to help us in\nunderstanding the environment that we work\n\n8\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.700\nin inside the computers.\n\n9\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.740\nWe're talking about of course legal types\nof issues, health related types of issues,\n\n10\n00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.190\nas well as environmental issues.\n\n11\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.570\nDoctor Omwansa himself is actually here to\nhelp us to understand these a little bit\n\n12\n00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.540\nmore clearly, so\nwelcome back to our studio, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.450\n>> Thank you very much for having me here.\n\n14\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.490\nThis is normally towards the end of\na course on fundamentals of computing and\n\n15\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.570\nwe always realize that computers\ndon't exist in isolation,\n\n16\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.630\nthey connect to other things in life.\n\n17\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.920\nWhen you start thinking about\nhealth issues, because we can get\n\n18\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.590\nvery excited about computers, but\nthey have potential negative effect.\n\n19\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.220\nAnd the more we're informed and\n\n20\n00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.890\neducated about them,\nthe more we can protect ourselves.\n\n21\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.590\nWhen we interact with other\npeople comes ethical issues.\n\n22\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.880\nEnvironmental, this computer\ndoesn't exist forever.\n\n23\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.160\nAt some point in time we'll probably have\nto dispose it or do something about it so\n\n24\n00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.540\nthat we can replace it.\n\n25\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.480\nWell, how do we think about\nenvironmental issues in that context?\n\n26\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.140\nThere are legal issues, when you have\nsoftware that you've been given,\n\n27\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.200\nit doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you own that software.\n\n28\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.330\nYou probably have access to it,\nthe different kind of arrangements, and\n\n29\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.620\nwe'll be talking about them.\n\n30\n00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.500\nSo that's why it's important to think\nabout these elements in the context\n\n31\n00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.450\nof computing.\n\n32\n00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.120\n>> All right, so Dr. Omwansa,\nlet's go over some of the basic\n\n33\n00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.180\ntypes of legal issues first, since\nthat's what we really want to address.\n\n34\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.260\nThere's some different terminology in\nthere that maybe some of us are familiar\n\n35\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.080\nwith, but not many of us.\n\n36\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.900\nSo what are some of the legal\nissues in computing that we have\n\n37\n00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.020\nto actually think about?\n\n38\n00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.940\n>> I think a great starting point when\nwe think about the legal issues and\n\n39\n00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.310\nsome of the terminologies is one\nis intellectual property and\n\n40\n00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.910\nI think the other one is copyright.\n\n41\n00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.290\nSo when we think about intellectual\nproperty we're thinking about exclusive\n\n42\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.940\nrights that someone has\nin terms of ownership for\n\n43\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.090\nsomething that they possibly created or\nproduced.\n\n44\n00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.600\nSo if I create a software,\nif you create a software,\n\n45\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.742\nif someone else creates a software,\nthey own the intellectual property,\n\n46\n00:02:30.742 --> 00:02:34.150\nthey own the rights to use that content.\n\n47\n00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.580\nAnd that means we must respect that\nintellectual property rights because if\n\n48\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.750\nwe try to take away those rights from\nother people who already have them,\n\n49\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.480\nthen it has significant consequences.\n\n50\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.860\nAnd the fact that people have\nintellectual property rights on something\n\n51\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.370\nmeans they're entitled to the benefit\nthat will come from that kind of product.\n\n52\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.260\nAnd if they have registered it, they can\nuse that kind of rights to commercialize,\n\n53\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.820\nand therefore they will be paid for\ntheir thoughts, for\n\n54\n00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.900\ntheir hard work, and for\nthe usage of whatever comes out of it.\n\n55\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.730\nSo that's one thing that we must\nstrongly learn to respect, and\n\n56\n00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.720\nalso if we have intellectual\nproperty rights on something,\n\n57\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.019\nthen it's an opportunity to\nfigure out how do we possibly\n\n58\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.860\ncreate new value out of it so\nthat we can benefit out of it.\n\n59\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.170\nSo you may have studied\nfundamentals of computing, but\n\n60\n00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.110\nthat doesn't mean you're always going\nto be just a user, you can create.\n\n61\n00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.720\n>> No doubt, so Dr. Omwansa, help us\nto contrast the idea that intellectual\n\n62\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.720\nproperty then, with that copyright.\n\n63\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.360\nOne of course is saying that I actually\nhave the exclusive ownership of this,\n\n64\n00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.220\nand the other one on copyrights\nhere are about what,\n\n65\n00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.190\nwhen we start talking\nabout the difference?\n\n66\n00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.190\n>> Yeah, now in the context of copyright,\nI can have a copyright\n\n67\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.420\nthat enables me to use something for\na period of time.\n\n68\n00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.200\nDepends on the rules and\n\n69\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.550\nthe regulation that can exist at\ncertain time in certain countries.\n\n70\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.340\nSo maybe I might be entitled to use\nsomething for a period of time.\n\n71\n00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.160\nIt could be one year,\nit could be my lifetime,\n\n72\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.300\nit could be my lifetime with\nthe lifetime of my children.\n\n73\n00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.140\nAnd then from there,\nthe copyright kind of comes to an end.\n\n74\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.470\nI don't have to have created something in\norder to have really copyright for it,\n\n75\n00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.350\nbut I can get the copyright for something\nI could probably put what's together and\n\n76\n00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.050\ndevelop a concept,\nit doesn't even have to be like a product.\n\n77\n00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.940\nHave a concept that I've put together and\nthen I now have the right to use it in\n\n78\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.850\ncertain ways in order to make new value,\nprobably money, or whatever it may be.\n\n79\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.466\n>> There's no doubt that these are\nactually two concepts that we really need\n\n80\n00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:04.798\nto at least understand\nright at the beginning,\n\n81\n00:05:04.798 --> 00:05:07.498\nintellectual property is\nyour exclusive ownership.\n\n82\n00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:10.685\nBut then if Dr.\nOmwansa created something and\n\n83\n00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:14.769\nthen I said I would like to\nuse your content, Dr. Omwansa,\n\n84\n00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:19.278\nand I actually purchased it or\nI actually got the copyright to it.\n\n85\n00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:22.926\nIt really means that I have that right for\na period of time to be able to\n\n86\n00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:26.710\nactually use, and distribute,\nand do whatever else I need to.\n\n87\n00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.710\nSometimes you actually\nhave to think about that.\n\n88\n00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.500\nBut today,\nthe problem is because it's the Internet.\n\n89\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.245\nthe very fact is intellectual property and\ncopyrights may not always be honored,\n\n90\n00:05:37.245 --> 00:05:39.135\neven though you can claim those rights.\n\n91\n00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:39.815\nAnd somebody says well,\n\n92\n00:05:39.815 --> 00:05:44.695\nit was out there on the internet, I freely\ndownloaded it, it's freely mine, Dr.\n\n93\n00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:48.880\nOmwansa, I have that with your book,\nyou cannot do anything about it.\n\n94\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.550\nBut there are ways that we\ncan actually value those,\n\n95\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.090\nwe can actually keep the respect of those\nthings in terms of intellectual property\n\n96\n00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.180\nand copyright when we use something\nthat's called DRM, right?\n\n97\n00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.570\n>> Yes, now we're beginning to deal with\nthe online context, digital context.\n\n98\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.910\nSo we can use technology to\n\n99\n00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.210\ncontrol access to copyrighted material,\ncopyrighted content.\n\n100\n00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.290\nAnd that's the power of\nthe digital version of it.\n\n101\n00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.210\nBecause as it is, I might be in\nsome other country somewhere and\n\n102\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.430\nI download something and\nall of a sudden, probably,\n\n103\n00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.770\nI don't even know,\nmaybe someone else who created it?\n\n104\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.450\nOr, I am the one who created content and\nI'm availing it online and\n\n105\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.300\nI struggle a little bit.\n\n106\n00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.550\nMaybe, Ronnie, you might want to give\nus a little bit of some of the details\n\n107\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.455\nespecially when it comes to music.\n\n108\n00:06:44.455 --> 00:06:48.245\nI've seen this to be a very powerful\ntool when it comes to music.\n\n109\n00:06:48.245 --> 00:06:49.510\nI don't play a lot of music.\n\n110\n00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.155\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n111\n00:06:50.155 --> 00:06:52.495\nsometimes I'm not very\nfamiliar with the details.\n\n112\n00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.484\n>> Right, when you start thinking,\nespecially in the context of music, and\n\n113\n00:06:55.484 --> 00:06:57.476\nthat's probably the easiest\none to think about,\n\n114\n00:06:57.476 --> 00:06:59.835\nis an artist creates\ntheir particular music.\n\n115\n00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:03.110\nAnd then of course,\nthey want to sell it to make money.\n\n116\n00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.800\nWell, there is this unusual\nthing that happens.\n\n117\n00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.890\nSomebody normally digitizes that music and\nthey store it.\n\n118\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.900\nAnd somebody else ends up downloading it.\n\n119\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.190\nAnd then they tell their friends to go and\ndownload it.\n\n120\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.480\nThen they tell their friends to go and\ndownload it, and\n\n121\n00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.768\nnow that particular artist\nmay have actually only made,\n\n122\n00:07:18.768 --> 00:07:23.990\nlet's say $10 off of their music.\n\n123\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.148\nBut they see that it's been distributed\nhundreds of times, if 10,000 times,\n\n124\n00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:30.580\nand they only made $10 off of it.\n\n125\n00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.841\nDigital rights management allows\nus to add in extra material to,\n\n126\n00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:39.721\nor extra digital material to those songs,\nto that music, that says look,\n\n127\n00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:41.671\nthis is actually protected.\n\n128\n00:07:41.671 --> 00:07:44.820\nAnd so that way,\nwhen your machine tries to play it,\n\n129\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.337\nit says you do not have\nthe rights to do so.\n\n130\n00:07:47.337 --> 00:07:49.921\nSo it can block you from\nactually being able to use it.\n\n131\n00:07:49.921 --> 00:07:54.733\nThereby, using a programming\nmethodology to ensure those copyrights\n\n132\n00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:57.458\nare actually going to be respected, and\n\n133\n00:07:57.458 --> 00:08:03.087\nthe idea of intellectual property can also\nbe respected when you start doing that.\n\n134\n00:08:03.087 --> 00:08:08.050\nAnd a lot of the stuff that appears\non the Internet, in content terms,\n\n135\n00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.177\nare actually digitally locked in this way.\n\n136\n00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:13.511\nSo that not everybody can download it for\nfree.\n\n137\n00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:17.618\nAnd if you do want it, you will have to\ngo to the authorized site that will then,\n\n138\n00:08:17.618 --> 00:08:21.791\nof course, give you a key that will match\nup to something that they'll store and\n\n139\n00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:23.050\nthen they can check.\n\n140\n00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.960\nWhenever you try to play that piece of\nmusic or when you try to watch that video,\n\n141\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.780\nif you do not have the rights to do so,\nyou will not be able to.\n\n142\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.140\nSo it is one way that has been happening,\n\n143\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.970\nespecially with digital information\nthat has really helped to try and\n\n144\n00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.140\nrespect this, for the sake of\nartists really, is where it began.\n\n145\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.100\nBut you can imagine if Dr.\nOmwansa came out with a book,\n\n146\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.360\nthe example I was using, and\nI said, I noticed that Dr.\n\n147\n00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.445\nOmwansa stored this on a publicly\naccessible folder online.\n\n148\n00:08:54.445 --> 00:08:58.391\nI'm just going to copy it down to mine and\nI start giving it away.\n\n149\n00:08:58.391 --> 00:09:01.440\nDr. Omwansa may say wait a minute,\nthat was my book.\n\n150\n00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.250\nI was supposed to make money off of that.\n\n151\n00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.100\nBut Ronnie has actually given it away\n10,000 times and I didn't make anything.\n\n152\n00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.804\nBut because I'm still developing it,\nit would be very bad for Dr.\n\n153\n00:09:12.804 --> 00:09:14.233\nOmwansa to do that.\n\n154\n00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:17.316\nAnd so instead he could go ahead and\ncreate that content,\n\n155\n00:09:17.316 --> 00:09:20.770\nhave it digitally locked with\na digital rights manager.\n\n156\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.100\nAnd so if I download it,\nI'm not authorized to actually open it or\n\n157\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.630\nto view it or to see it.\n\n158\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.140\nIt really does make a difference.\n\n159\n00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.390\nIt requires a little bit more setup.\n\n160\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.850\nBut it can be done and is actually worth\nit for every artist to actually do that.\n\n161\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.570\nAnd that's why they tend to go through\nthese companies when they publish it that\n\n162\n00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.300\nthey already have all that set up and\nthey just add an extra fee on.\n\n163\n00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.410\nAnd now all their digital content is\nalso stored with that same information.\n\n164\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.560\nAnd not saying that there's\nnot ways around it, but\n\n165\n00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.870\nit's more difficult than if it's\nnot actually locked that way.\n\n166\n00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.960\n>> Aha, I knew, I knew that you dealt\nwith music before and you probably\n\n167\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.410\nhave some personal experiences that\nyou could give in the context of that.\n\n168\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.310\nNow, it doesn't necessarily mean that\nif someone else has created software,\n\n169\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.870\nwe can't use it.\n\n170\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.650\nThat's not the point, otherwise,\nhow would they make money out of it.\n\n171\n00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.550\nOr if we create software, we create\nproducts that are digital, it doesn't mean\n\n172\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.870\nthat we can keep other people to use\nthem because they wanna use them and\n\n173\n00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.630\nthey are willing to pay for them.\n\n174\n00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:23.403\nSo that's why it becomes necessary to\nstart thinking about software licensing.\n\n175\n00:10:23.403 --> 00:10:26.216\nWhich means I can create a product and\n\n176\n00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:29.860\nI can give someone a license\nto actually use it.\n\n177\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.170\nIt doesn't mean they own it, but that\nthey can use it whenever they need to.\n\n178\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.710\nSo there is a great, great term that you\nsomehow will come across whenever you\n\n179\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.571\ninstall software or you patch software and\nyou intend to use in different place.\n\n180\n00:10:43.571 --> 00:10:46.680\nIt's the End User License Agreement.\n\n181\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:54.120\nThis agreement is kind of like a binding\narrangement between you and the supplier.\n\n182\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.625\nSo you are the end user,\n\n183\n00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:59.090\ndo you're the one who's going to use the\nsoftware that someone else has provided.\n\n184\n00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.729\nOr if you create software,\n\n185\n00:11:00.729 --> 00:11:05.450\nthen the other person who's going to use\nit is the one who signs that document.\n\n186\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.250\nNow the signing isn't necessarily a\nphysical signing as we conventionally know\n\n187\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.260\nabout signing.\n\n188\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.210\nBut this is an opportunity to accept and\nyou're gonna do that electronically.\n\n189\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.380\nSo when you are installing\nthe software before it fully installs\n\n190\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.710\nit might get somewhere to ask you,\ndo you accept the agreement?\n\n191\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.350\nAnd that means some\nagreement must have come.\n\n192\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.640\nSo it's a license agreement that comes,\ndo you accept?\n\n193\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.110\nAnd it won't install if you don't accept.\n\n194\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.910\nSo once you go through, and\nsometimes it can be a long document, yeah?\n\n195\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.340\nAnd it has several terms, and\nconditions, and things like that.\n\n196\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.960\nAnd it is assumed that once you say\nI agree, that it means you have gone\n\n197\n00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.500\nthrough the contract and\nyou actually have agreed to the terms.\n\n198\n00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.860\nNow the terms,\nI have noted that some people don't\n\n199\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.040\nread [LAUGH] those\nlicenses to the very end.\n\n200\n00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.730\nBut keep in mind that you're taking\nresponsibility the moment you say I agree.\n\n201\n00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.500\nAnd it's the same thing as if you\nwere gonna take a loan in a bank.\n\n202\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:14.680\nAnd you want to use that mortgage, or\nyou wanna purchase something, you sign.\n\n203\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.620\nOnce you've signed,\nthe consequences that come with it,\n\n204\n00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.905\nyou will be responsible for it, all right?\n\n205\n00:12:21.905 --> 00:12:24.055\nNow that's why it's important to read and\n\n206\n00:12:24.055 --> 00:12:27.255\nat least get a sense of really what\nyou're committing yourself to.\n\n207\n00:12:27.255 --> 00:12:30.165\nThink about it this way,\nif the interest rates change and\n\n208\n00:12:30.165 --> 00:12:33.785\nall of a sudden you're being asked\nto pay a little more in the bank.\n\n209\n00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:38.217\nYou can go back and say, well I don't\nagree with you because I've been paying so\n\n210\n00:12:38.217 --> 00:12:38.958\nmuch money.\n\n211\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.095\nNow you're telling me I'm going to pay for\ntwo more months?\n\n212\n00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:42.745\nI thought I should have\nfinished at this time.\n\n213\n00:12:42.745 --> 00:12:47.200\nThey say well [COUGH]\nthe market changed and\n\n214\n00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.900\nnow you'll have to pay\na little more interest.\n\n215\n00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.280\nAnd because you signed, that's it.\n\n216\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.940\nSo, in the case of software you may\nhave scenarios where you probably\n\n217\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.830\nwill pay a monthly fee,\nlike on regular basis.\n\n218\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.480\nOr you've been given this right to use and\n\n219\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.910\ntherefore you're required not\nto give other people for free.\n\n220\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:13.130\nIt's only limited to so many computers or\nso many users at that time.\n\n221\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:19.030\nOr sometimes you may be told,\nwell, you cannot copy it and\n\n222\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:24.020\nput it somewhere else, so\nit can only be in that particular version.\n\n223\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.740\nSo you have to keep it, it's a disk or\na memory stick or whatever.\n\n224\n00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.390\nYou probably,\nyou will not be allowed to do.\n\n225\n00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:34.110\nSo it depends on what the terms are,\n\n226\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.880\nwhich you need to abide to,\notherwise you'll be inviting trouble.\n\n227\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.320\n>> There is no doubt that\nthe End User Licensing Agreement,\n\n228\n00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.300\nbecause we're talking\nabout legal issues and\n\n229\n00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.760\ncomputing right now, is the key\nto understand it's a legal issue.\n\n230\n00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:54.020\nSo it's not that there is\nsomebody watching you that says,\n\n231\n00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.440\nyou better make sure your\nread all these questions.\n\n232\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.780\nWhen software is installed,\na lot of times you'll get this agreement.\n\n233\n00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:04.240\nAnd they assume that you'll read it,\nonce you actually put a check-box in, and\n\n234\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.570\nthat means you are responsible for\nall the terms of those agreements.\n\n235\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.399\nMost of those agreements have\nto really do with this thing.\n\n236\n00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.930\nThey set up how you can\nofficially use that software, and\n\n237\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.480\nthey set up the penalties if you\nchoose to do so differently.\n\n238\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.950\nIt doesn't necessarily\nmean that if you do so\n\n239\n00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.290\ndifferently, that you will\nactually get penalized for it.\n\n240\n00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.110\nBut what it means for that company,\nthat if they choose to though,\n\n241\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:33.630\nthey can enforce those penalties upon you\nand that is the key to understanding.\n\n242\n00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:38.560\nSo a lot of people that say I don't know,\nI never read those licensing agreements,\n\n243\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.890\nyou may want to take a little bit\nof time to read some of them.\n\n244\n00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.149\nEverything that is written there though,\nis normally written by lawyers,\n\n245\n00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:47.553\na team of legal experts.\n\n246\n00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.042\nSo that you cannot manipulate or\n\n247\n00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:55.000\ntalk your way out of why you\ndid not follow that agreement.\n\n248\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.710\nSo you do wanna be careful here\nwhen you start talking about\n\n249\n00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.760\nthat End User Licensing Agreement.\n\n250\n00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.220\nAlong with that,\nthere's also companies that also add in\n\n251\n00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.930\nthe idea of what they call anti-piracy\ntechniques that are there, and\n\n252\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.280\nthat's what we call product activation.\n\n253\n00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.370\nProduct activation allows you to install,\nallows you to use it,\n\n254\n00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:17.070\nand may even give you a grace period\nof a few days to use it and try it.\n\n255\n00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.020\nIt could be up to 30 days, it could be\nas long as whatever the company wants.\n\n256\n00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.706\nAnd then afterwards, they are going\nto ask you to activate that.\n\n257\n00:15:22.706 --> 00:15:25.920\nAnd that means that you have\nto connect to their servers\n\n258\n00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.580\nto actually prove that you\npurchased that product.\n\n259\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:35.009\nIf you haven't, either the product will\nfunction at not a full version anymore,\n\n260\n00:15:35.009 --> 00:15:38.087\nbut it may function\na little bit differently.\n\n261\n00:15:38.087 --> 00:15:42.853\nFor example, Microsoft Office, Dr Omwansa,\nif you don't purchase that after a while,\n\n262\n00:15:42.853 --> 00:15:46.005\nyou do not have the ability to\nprint your documents in Word.\n\n263\n00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:50.329\nI'd hate for Dr. Omwansa, I know that Dr.\nOmwansa would never do this, but I'd hate\n\n264\n00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:53.837\nfor him to type out the whole thing and\nthen he says, I need a hard copy.\n\n265\n00:15:53.837 --> 00:15:58.258\nAnd then if he's using an unlicensed\nproduct or he doesn't activate it,\n\n266\n00:15:58.258 --> 00:16:01.630\nthen he goes to print and\nit doesn't allow him to print.\n\n267\n00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.546\nIt doesn't operate at full functionality.\n\n268\n00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:07.342\nSo, the product activation is\nabout anti piracy so that,\n\n269\n00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:12.765\nnobody steals the product outright, but\nthe end user's licensing agreement is,\n\n270\n00:16:12.765 --> 00:16:16.122\nyou're agreeing to the legal\nterms of that usage.\n\n271\n00:16:16.122 --> 00:16:19.770\nAnd that, that means that\ncompany has a right to say,\n\n272\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.650\nif I want to sue Ronnie Wong,\nbecause he's not using it correctly.\n\n273\n00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.650\nThat he has,\nthat company has a right to do so, and\n\n274\n00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.530\nthat's why we wanna be careful\nwith this stuff as well.\n\n275\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:33.310\nNow when it comes down to software and\nlicensing, Dr. Omwansa, there's really two\n\n276\n00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:37.540\nbroad categories of this,\nwhich is proprietary and open source.\n\n277\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.350\nSo let's talk about that a little bit.\n\n278\n00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.630\n>> Yeah,\nthat's a very important distinction,\n\n279\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.670\nbecause that's just show us what are some\nof the flexibilities we have out there.\n\n280\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:51.200\nSo when you deal with proprietary\nsoftware, it means that whoever created\n\n281\n00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.320\nthe software or the event, for\nthat matter, they retain the ownership.\n\n282\n00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.620\nThey have the rights for\nthe ownership of that product.\n\n283\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.690\nAs a user, if I purchase that software and\nI get to use it,\n\n284\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:08.330\nI don't have the ownership rights to it,\nI only have the usage rights.\n\n285\n00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.880\nSo it means I'm in possession\nof this document, and\n\n286\n00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.130\nI can use it, but I don't own it.\n\n287\n00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.930\nNow, that means at some point in time when\nI stole that, as part of that agreement\n\n288\n00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.740\nthat I signed, the end user.\n\n289\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:30.350\nThe limitations, or the bond areas within\nwhich I can operate then become effective.\n\n290\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:35.170\nSo every so often I need to keep checking\nif I have my license right, you know for\n\n291\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.780\nthe operating system for example, for\nthe Microsoft Office as an example.\n\n292\n00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:44.950\nYou know, whatever product that I have,\nI have to be sure that my license\n\n293\n00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:49.430\nis valid as per the previous\nconversations that we've had here.\n\n294\n00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:52.702\nBut then there's the option for\nopen source software and\n\n295\n00:17:52.702 --> 00:17:55.711\nas you can tell that my tone\nhas changed a little bit.\n\n296\n00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:58.218\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's because sometimes you\n\n297\n00:17:58.218 --> 00:18:03.190\nthink about a proprietary software,\nit has strict guidelines on its usage.\n\n298\n00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:08.220\nIt is for commercial reasons that that\nsomebody provided that software etc.\n\n299\n00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.600\nWhen you begin to think about,\n\n300\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.920\nwell sometimes maybe somebody needs to\ncreate some software, set a foundation.\n\n301\n00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.170\nSo that other people can build on that\nsoftware and it can be available for\n\n302\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.460\nother people out there.\n\n303\n00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.980\nAnd maybe you want to make a contribution\nto that particular software.\n\n304\n00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.100\nThere comes the open\nsource kind of software.\n\n305\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.150\nSo the license in that case\nis a little different.\n\n306\n00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.050\nThe general public license,\nthe GPL, is a different\n\n307\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:39.590\nkind of license which enables you to\nget the software, get the source code.\n\n308\n00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:44.000\nThat means the regional material that\nwas used to activate that software and\n\n309\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.400\nyou can make edits on it,\nchanges on it, improvements on it.\n\n310\n00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:53.170\nAnd it's a communal kind of product, that\npeople own and we can build out of it.\n\n311\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.640\nSo, you may ask yourself, so\nwhy would anyone in this planet try to\n\n312\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.925\nspend a lot of time creating software,\nand then you just avail it for free?\n\n313\n00:19:00.925 --> 00:19:03.190\nWell, it's the same question\nyou might ask yourself.\n\n314\n00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.490\nWhy does somebody spend a lot\nof time creating viruses?\n\n315\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.960\nSo, motives are all different but,\nin this case,\n\n316\n00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.940\ntheir value being created\nthat people will believe.\n\n317\n00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.280\nIt's a human feeling that,\n\n318\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.210\nlook we can create software,\nall of us can create software,\n\n319\n00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.300\nsomeone maybe starts the process and\nthen we all become part of the movement.\n\n320\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.040\nMaybe not all of us, but\nthose of us interested become part of\n\n321\n00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.670\na movement in creating a product,\nthat we can all get to use.\n\n322\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.500\nNow, that means even if I don't have\nthe money, I can possibly use a software.\n\n323\n00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.170\nSo there is a strong believing, seven\nquarters of society, that software really\n\n324\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.960\nshould be available, and we don't have to\nlimit people because they can't afford.\n\n325\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.110\nBut then how could possibly people make\nmoney out of it, make a living out of it.\n\n326\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.030\nDepends you know there can be foundations\nthat can donate resources to what's\n\n327\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.710\nimportant to develop\nthis kind of software.\n\n328\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.130\nGovernments that can provide\nresources to you know people.\n\n329\n00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:07.170\nIf you take some open source software,\nyou can configure it and then rather\n\n330\n00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:12.419\nthan sell it, you can provide it for free\nand then you provide training and support.\n\n331\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.300\nAnd expose people and in that case,\nyou can be paid for that service.\n\n332\n00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.290\nSo these are the options for\nthe general public license software.\n\n333\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.580\n>> When you start seeing both of these,\nthe idea proprietary software,\n\n334\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.240\nwhat it really means for a user is simple.\n\n335\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.060\nEven though you might buy a copy\nlet's say of Microsoft Office,\n\n336\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.030\nyou really do not own that copy.\n\n337\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.560\nYou are buying the right to\nuse that copy of the software.\n\n338\n00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.643\nIt sounds strange,\neven though you purchased it, but\n\n339\n00:20:40.643 --> 00:20:43.815\nin Open Source though because\nthey give you everything.\n\n340\n00:20:43.815 --> 00:20:47.715\nYou have the right to change it, to\nmodify it, to do whatever you want to it.\n\n341\n00:20:47.715 --> 00:20:51.125\nSo even though it's free you can\ndownload it and you can modify it and\n\n342\n00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:55.535\nessentially you own that copy of\nthat software when you do that.\n\n343\n00:20:55.535 --> 00:20:59.495\nOne is designed of course to make money\nfor the organization, the other one though\n\n344\n00:20:59.495 --> 00:21:02.400\nit's not that you cant make money like Dr.\nOmwansa was saying.\n\n345\n00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.470\nBut a lot of it is actually volunteering.\n\n346\n00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.370\nIt is saying that you believe that that\nproduct, even though you got it for\n\n347\n00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.610\nfree, Dr. Omwansa, is good, you may say,\n\n348\n00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:15.540\nhey if you like my product please\ndonate $10, or please donate $20.\n\n349\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.750\nTo help keep this project going and\n\n350\n00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.480\nthere's a lot of people on\nthe world that believed that.\n\n351\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.640\nInstead of just saying,\n\n352\n00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.850\nthis same product by now have donated $20\nfor, it's something I would of had to\n\n353\n00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.760\npurchase in this proprietary\nsoftware that cost me 300.\n\n354\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.240\nAnd now you see the difference.\n\n355\n00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.246\nIt may actually have you all\nthe same functionalities but\n\n356\n00:21:33.246 --> 00:21:36.813\none actually is because they said\nit shouldn't cost that much and so\n\n357\n00:21:36.813 --> 00:21:39.018\nthat's why I'm charging $20 for it.\n\n358\n00:21:39.018 --> 00:21:42.118\nAnd the other company says,\nI put a lot of effort into this,\n\n359\n00:21:42.118 --> 00:21:44.600\nI'm gonna charge 300 for this.\n\n360\n00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.185\nSo, both of these are good models and\nthey do help.\n\n361\n00:21:47.185 --> 00:21:52.030\nNow Dr. Omwansa, there is outright\nstealing of software though, isn't there?\n\n362\n00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:56.191\n>> Yeah, yeah, there are people out there,\nthe same we say people creating viruses\n\n363\n00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:59.370\nthat can hack your computer\nif you're not careful.\n\n364\n00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:05.160\nThere are people out there who just want\nto use other people's software, for free.\n\n365\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.320\nAnd others just want to distribute it for\nfree for whatever motive, all right?\n\n366\n00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.360\nSo software piracy is a big deal, it is\n\n367\n00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.360\nunauthorized copying and distribution\nof software, which is against the law.\n\n368\n00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.110\nSo you may get Counterfeit software and\ncounterfeit software out there, so\n\n369\n00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.160\nyou want to be careful,\nwhen you're purchasing software.\n\n370\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.980\nBecause you can get people who actually\nhave it, regional software, but\n\n371\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.910\nthey've packaged it for use.\n\n372\n00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:38.330\nAnd when you stole it, you wouldn't know\nwhat the difference is between what is\n\n373\n00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.660\na regional and what is fake and\nin this case counterfeit.\n\n374\n00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.430\nAnd counterfeit software has\nfound itself in many markets.\n\n375\n00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:52.360\nAnd sometimes the regulations\nare probably not enforced strictly,\n\n376\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.710\nsuch that the counterfeit software seems\nto find itself in the market out there.\n\n377\n00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:02.710\nAnd there are many websites who probably\nprovide options of downloading of\n\n378\n00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:07.500\nthe keys and identification mechanisms for\n\n379\n00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.420\nthat software, so\nthat's one scenario could possibly find.\n\n380\n00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.250\nThe other scenario that you could\nfind in times of this kind of\n\n381\n00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.410\npiracy issues is where\nthis copyright piracy.\n\n382\n00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:22.775\nAnd copyright piracy is when people\npatches software and they patches for\n\n383\n00:23:22.775 --> 00:23:26.965\ncertain number of licenses, that means\nthey can use it in certain number of ways.\n\n384\n00:23:26.965 --> 00:23:32.325\nFor example, it can say it should be\nin ten computers and then people get\n\n385\n00:23:32.325 --> 00:23:36.705\nto install it in more than ten computers,\nthat's kind of a corporate scenario.\n\n386\n00:23:36.705 --> 00:23:41.665\nThere are many other instances on the\ninternet, there are scenarios where people\n\n387\n00:23:41.665 --> 00:23:45.170\nhave already loaded software\nthat shouldn't be loaded there.\n\n388\n00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.342\nAnd people now download it in\nother places and get to use it.\n\n389\n00:23:48.342 --> 00:23:52.796\nWell look, it can be free or\nat a very low cost.\n\n390\n00:23:52.796 --> 00:23:57.012\nLook, if you can get it,\nI mean, it's not impossible, and\n\n391\n00:23:57.012 --> 00:23:59.504\npeople are doing these implicits.\n\n392\n00:23:59.504 --> 00:24:03.161\nSo it's nothing new, but\nI will let you know that is piracy,\n\n393\n00:24:03.161 --> 00:24:05.837\nand it can have significant consequences.\n\n394\n00:24:05.837 --> 00:24:09.833\n>> All right, so Dr. Omwansa, we also\nwanna just briefly touch on the ethical\n\n395\n00:24:09.833 --> 00:24:12.087\ntypes of issues that we have in computing.\n\n396\n00:24:12.087 --> 00:24:16.985\nAnd the two big ones that we actually\nwanna worry about here are the idea\n\n397\n00:24:16.985 --> 00:24:18.220\nof plagiarism.\n\n398\n00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.710\nAnd then we wanna talk about a couple\nof other issues a little bit later\n\n399\n00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.670\nsuch as the idea of libel and\nslander as well.\n\n400\n00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.340\nSo, Dr. Omwansa, let's talk about\nthis idea of plagiarism just briefly.\n\n401\n00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.065\n>> Yeah, plagiarism, I mean this is\na term that tends to happen more and\n\n402\n00:24:32.065 --> 00:24:36.385\nmore in academic institutions where\nstudents are supposed to do assignments.\n\n403\n00:24:36.385 --> 00:24:40.797\nAnd maybe they go online or go to some\nother kind of work that has been done,\n\n404\n00:24:40.797 --> 00:24:45.017\nphysical or otherwise, and\ncopy the work and claim that it is theirs.\n\n405\n00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:49.580\nOr they insert portions of other people's\ncontent and put it into theirs, and\n\n406\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.970\nsay it's gonna be mine.\n\n407\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.690\nOr they change a few phrases here and\nthere, and words, and\n\n408\n00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:57.000\nthen they say now this,\nthey take credit for it.\n\n409\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.080\nOr they just take material from different\nsources, and put it all together, and\n\n410\n00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.340\nthen say it is theirs.\n\n411\n00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.730\nWhat you're basically doing,\nis you're plagiarizing.\n\n412\n00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:09.120\nAnd that is not only a bad habit,\nbut it really,\n\n413\n00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.020\nreally, really causes harm to the people\nwho normally create this kind of work,\n\n414\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.330\nbecause you're unfairly taking\ncredit from other people's work.\n\n415\n00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.470\nThere is nothing wrong in utilizing\nother people's work because we\n\n416\n00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.750\nbuild knowledge by riding\non other people's work.\n\n417\n00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:29.120\nWe learn, that's why we do literature\nreview or review of relevant literature.\n\n418\n00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.410\nSo that's all right, but\nyou must learn to do citation.\n\n419\n00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.350\nThat means,\nrecognize other people's work and\n\n420\n00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:40.440\nthat can be, you can cite it,\nyou can copy it and put it in quote and\n\n421\n00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.760\nacknowledge that you obtained\nit from someone else.\n\n422\n00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.940\nYou can put in a bibliography,\nor footnotes, or end notes, and\n\n423\n00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.480\nthose are things that are available\nin Microsoft Word, for example.\n\n424\n00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:55.670\nThat you can use to acknowledge that\nwork was obtained from someone else,\n\n425\n00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.960\nthat's a feature that you can use.\n\n426\n00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.000\nParaphrasing is also another\npossibility and it uses the same logic.\n\n427\n00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.845\nAnd you can acknowledge that you actually\nobtained the contents from someone else.\n\n428\n00:26:08.845 --> 00:26:11.390\n>> There's no doubt that there's\nmany different issues here.\n\n429\n00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.470\nAnd there are some that\nare really kind of not\n\n430\n00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.490\nthe most unusual thing about ethics here.\n\n431\n00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:22.810\nBut we can talk about censorship and\neven filtering of content a lot.\n\n432\n00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.801\nBut when it comes down to some of\nthe ideas here of ethical issues,\n\n433\n00:26:26.801 --> 00:26:30.503\nwe normally really refer to\nthe idea of plagiarism a lot, and\n\n434\n00:26:30.503 --> 00:26:35.527\nalso that idea of libel and standard, or\nnot standard, libel and slander [LAUGH].\n\n435\n00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:37.245\nI couldn't remember what\nwords I was gonna say.\n\n436\n00:26:37.245 --> 00:26:41.980\nSo Dr. Omwansa, take us through that\njust briefly, that idea of libel and\n\n437\n00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.501\nslander, and let's differentiate\nthose two when we take a look here.\n\n438\n00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:51.868\n>> Well, in different context for\ndifferent motives,\n\n439\n00:26:51.868 --> 00:26:57.484\npeople do control content,\nand for whatever reasons.\n\n440\n00:26:57.484 --> 00:27:02.799\nIt could be political reasons,\nit could be financial reasons, and so we\n\n441\n00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:08.960\ntalk a lot about censorship and filtering,\ntrying to protect who can see what.\n\n442\n00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.110\nBut we also have scenarios\nwhere people use proxy\n\n443\n00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.230\nservers to block who can see what.\n\n444\n00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:21.100\nAnd so those are features that you\ncould easily pick and control.\n\n445\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:27.750\nYou can also block websites and\nblock images that people can see.\n\n446\n00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:28.430\nFor example,\n\n447\n00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.700\nif you are at home and you want to\nhave a limit as to who can see what.\n\n448\n00:27:33.265 --> 00:27:35.821\nNow, I probably am going to\nturn this a little bit so\n\n449\n00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:37.845\nI can take a little bit of a break.\n\n450\n00:27:37.845 --> 00:27:39.475\nIn the context of slander,\n\n451\n00:27:39.475 --> 00:27:43.100\nmaybe you wanna give me that\nexample that you gave me yesterday.\n\n452\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.666\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n453\n00:27:43.666 --> 00:27:46.675\nI get a sense of it as\nI take some water here.\n\n454\n00:27:46.675 --> 00:27:50.865\n>> So when we start taking a look here\nat the idea of libel and slander.\n\n455\n00:27:50.865 --> 00:27:55.130\nWell, it's really about what you end\nup seeing versus what's actually said.\n\n456\n00:27:55.130 --> 00:28:00.400\nSo the idea of libel of course,\nis when you put something down in writing\n\n457\n00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.150\nthat is going to actually cause harm or\n\n458\n00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:09.090\nsome type of degradation of\nsomeone's character or reputation.\n\n459\n00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.920\nSo in other words,\nit's what actually is written down.\n\n460\n00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.350\nSlander though is when you tend to\nactually have it verbally, Ashley said.\n\n461\n00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:21.976\nSo that way somebody can say well,\nlet me quote Dr. Omwansa on this.\n\n462\n00:28:21.976 --> 00:28:26.040\nAnd I'm going well, that actually sounds\nlike that he's ruining my reputation\n\n463\n00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.700\nthrough this message here and\nthis quote instead.\n\n464\n00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.730\nNow if I had read it,\nthat's one thing, that's libel,\n\n465\n00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.700\nbecause it's written down and\nit's now been printed out there.\n\n466\n00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.650\nThe idea of slander is when\nsomebody else quotes it to us.\n\n467\n00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:43.520\nAnd we've gotta be very careful,\nespecially in terms of ethical issues on\n\n468\n00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.690\nour computing systems, because this is\nwhat people bring up lawsuits about.\n\n469\n00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.945\nIs which one of these,\nas well as plagiarism,\n\n470\n00:28:50.945 --> 00:28:54.570\nit's one of these factors that as\nyou are connected to networks.\n\n471\n00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.450\nYou gotta realize that those are kind\nof the major ones that we tend to\n\n472\n00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.720\nactually worry about when it\ncomes down to legal issues.\n\n473\n00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.810\nThe idea of censorship, and sometimes what\nwe call flaming, and some of these other\n\n474\n00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.330\nthings, don't get me wrong,\nthose things are important ethically, but\n\n475\n00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.990\nat the same time, usually the legal\nportion is what we're worried about\n\n476\n00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:16.430\nwhen we work for an organization a lot of\ntimes, that we actually have to deal with.\n\n477\n00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.040\nSo that's normally what we talk\nabout in terms of slander and\n\n478\n00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.770\nor, libel and slander.\n\n479\n00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:26.402\n>> Yeah, I mean just to put a little\nmore emphasis on the slander bit\n\n480\n00:29:26.402 --> 00:29:32.690\nis you can mess someone's reputation,\nor an organization's reputation.\n\n481\n00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.368\nAnd those are things that institutions and\nindividuals care a lot about.\n\n482\n00:29:36.368 --> 00:29:39.094\nI mean, if Ronnie, I came here and\n\n483\n00:29:39.094 --> 00:29:44.938\nsay Ronnie does certain kind of things,\nwhich are not necessarily true.\n\n484\n00:29:44.938 --> 00:29:45.479\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n485\n00:29:45.479 --> 00:29:50.274\nthen because I have a certain interest\nI can hurt his reputation, and\n\n486\n00:29:50.274 --> 00:29:54.700\nprobably he gets his livelihood\nout of his reputation.\n\n487\n00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.670\nAnd when you think about institutions,\n\n488\n00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.910\nthey are living\norganizations by themselves.\n\n489\n00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.210\nThey're living entities.\n\n490\n00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.760\nThey feed, they grow,\nand things like that.\n\n491\n00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.710\nAnd reputational risk is a major\nissue to many organizations\n\n492\n00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.720\ndepending on the kind of services\nthat they give to their consumers.\n\n493\n00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.720\nSo you wanna be very\ncareful about slander, and\n\n494\n00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.660\nyou want to avoid being associated\nwith people who make slanderous\n\n495\n00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:28.040\nstatements and pronouncements for\nyour own safety.\n\n496\n00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.310\nBecause the consequences,\nas Ronnie rightfully said,\n\n497\n00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.950\nthey can be from a legal perspective,\n\n498\n00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:40.080\nand you just may not even have control\nto what the outcome might look like.\n\n499\n00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.600\nSo yeah, we've covered some good ground.\n\n500\n00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.807\nI thought that maybe right now we will,\nbecause we don't have all the time,\n\n501\n00:30:46.807 --> 00:30:49.700\nwe may wanna talk a little\nbit about the health issues\n\n502\n00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.838\nthat we can possibly get to deal with.\n\n503\n00:30:51.838 --> 00:30:57.170\nRonnie, a little while ago you start\nmentioning to me about eye problem, man.\n\n504\n00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.635\nBecause sometimes we get\nto look at the computer for\n\n505\n00:30:59.635 --> 00:31:02.171\na long time depending on\nwhat exactly we're doing.\n\n506\n00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:05.053\nSometimes our eyes can begin to strain and\n\n507\n00:31:05.053 --> 00:31:09.591\nwe need to start knowing how we\ncan manage ourselves in this case.\n\n508\n00:31:09.591 --> 00:31:13.780\nThere's so many things you can do, because\nfor sure the eyes can get affected.\n\n509\n00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.760\nNow, not all of us get to\nsuffer eye problems as a result\n\n510\n00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.570\nof watching the screen, or\nlooking at a screen for a long time.\n\n511\n00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.630\nThere are people who've\nused computer screens for\n\n512\n00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:27.110\nmany, many years and their eyes\nare just as sharp as they can be.\n\n513\n00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.480\nBut, it's good to take precaution.\n\n514\n00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.770\nThe kind of screen you use can determine.\n\n515\n00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:38.430\nLCDs are better than the cathode\nray tube kind of technology.\n\n516\n00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:43.870\nAnd if you can avoid, if you can\nshift towards LCD, please proceed.\n\n517\n00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:48.790\nHow close you are to computer screens\ncan also have an effect on your eyes,\n\n518\n00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.934\nso you want to be careful about it.\n\n519\n00:31:51.934 --> 00:31:54.005\nForm a habit of taking some\nbreaks in between there.\n\n520\n00:31:54.005 --> 00:31:58.427\nWhen you watch your screen for some time,\nreally working, and we totally understand,\n\n521\n00:31:58.427 --> 00:32:01.712\nwe all want to improve productivity so\nwe must focus, but every so\n\n522\n00:32:01.712 --> 00:32:03.046\noften try to take a break.\n\n523\n00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:05.211\nThere are many other things we can do.\n\n524\n00:32:05.211 --> 00:32:08.179\nRonnie, what are some other things\nyou've done before to ensure that\n\n525\n00:32:08.179 --> 00:32:09.296\nyour eyes are protected?\n\n526\n00:32:09.296 --> 00:32:11.451\n>> The idea here, especially on eyes,\n\n527\n00:32:11.451 --> 00:32:15.310\nright, is to make sure that you\ndo take those breaks and refocus.\n\n528\n00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:19.140\nIf you're at a constant rate and you're\nconstantly focusing down your eye muscles,\n\n529\n00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.030\nthey get fatigued just like anything else.\n\n530\n00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.380\nThe problem that you and\nI have is that our eyes,\n\n531\n00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.700\nwe really don't notice fatigue\nexcept when we start rubbing them.\n\n532\n00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.060\nAnd, you're not rubbing them, the reason\nwhy you think you are, a lot of times,\n\n533\n00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:30.700\nis that they're dry.\n\n534\n00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.930\nIt's because your eye muscles\nhave been strained for so long.\n\n535\n00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:38.000\nSo, always take breaks when you can,\nand refocus on something different.\n\n536\n00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.610\nThe other thing that I also do is keep\nlittle drops of tears, I know that sounds\n\n537\n00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:47.100\nfunny, but they actually do sell synthetic\ntears or, they call them eye drops.\n\n538\n00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.710\nAnd I'll also use those in\nbetween to ensure that my\n\n539\n00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.810\neyes also have the proper moisture.\n\n540\n00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:54.820\nIn a lot of these environments\nthat computers are in,\n\n541\n00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.140\nthere is a lot of air conditioning and\nthat means they're dryer as well.\n\n542\n00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.770\nSo I use those in combination again with\ntaking breaks and they seem to help.\n\n543\n00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:03.580\nNow, Dr. Omwansa,\n\n544\n00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:08.220\nthere's also the issue of posture when\nwe start dealing with computers as well.\n\n545\n00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.360\nSo what do we need to know there?\n\n546\n00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.820\n>> Posture is a big deal\nbecause you're gonna sit for\n\n547\n00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.610\na while, depending on what you're doing.\n\n548\n00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:19.930\nAnd sometimes you wanna be careful because\nyou want to support your back properly,\n\n549\n00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.250\nyou have to have your\nhead raised up properly.\n\n550\n00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:27.650\nThink about your arms, and\nwe're human beings, we're animals.\n\n551\n00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.590\nWe're just sophisticated animals.\n\n552\n00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A friend of mine calls it that way.\n\n553\n00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.400\nAnd we were meant to move around.\n\n554\n00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.830\nWe were meant to be active.\n\n555\n00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:41.030\nAnd so what I'm displaying right\nnow on my screen is an illustration\n\n556\n00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:45.390\nof someone who's not seated properly,\nwhen using a computer, and\n\n557\n00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.710\nanother one who is seated properly,\nthink about the feet.\n\n558\n00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:51.310\nOn the right,\nthe feet are actually horizontal.\n\n559\n00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.690\nI can see this one's\na little bit at an angle.\n\n560\n00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.510\nAnd then it's not at 90 degrees over here.\n\n561\n00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.210\nThis one is at 90 degrees.\n\n562\n00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.170\nLook at the back.\n\n563\n00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.770\nIt's kind of squatting.\n\n564\n00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:06.404\nIf you do this over time, you are probably\ngonna have some effect on your back.\n\n565\n00:34:06.404 --> 00:34:09.131\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You wanna sit straight up,\n\n566\n00:34:09.131 --> 00:34:11.190\nlook at the head, leaning forward.\n\n567\n00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:16.040\nLook at the arm,\nit's at probably 50 degrees or\n\n568\n00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.840\nso, this is of a 90 degrees.\n\n569\n00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.140\nAnd so this is for\nthe safety of your body.\n\n570\n00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:26.119\nBecause a lot of research has been done\nabout what is the best position as you\n\n571\n00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:27.820\nwork on a computer.\n\n572\n00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.290\nAnd even how close you are,\n\n573\n00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:33.860\nyou don't wanna be too far such that\nyou have to stretch your hands.\n\n574\n00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.730\nAnd you also don't wanna get\ntoo close that you're just\n\n575\n00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.090\ndealing with the computer.\n\n576\n00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.556\nAnd so those are some of the things that\nyou wanna think about for your own safety.\n\n577\n00:34:41.556 --> 00:34:43.410\n>> No doubt, Dr. Omwansa.\n\n578\n00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:46.390\nThese are actually very good hints for\nus as we start working more and\n\n579\n00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:48.860\nmore with computers on a daily basis.\n\n580\n00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.740\nOur last real environmental issue\nthough is the idea of disposal.\n\n581\n00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:55.980\nComputer systems again\nare consumables that after a while,\n\n582\n00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.400\nwe end up getting new computers.\n\n583\n00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.250\nWell, what happens to the old one?\n\n584\n00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.530\nWell, a lot of times those build up and\n\n585\n00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:05.090\nthey just sit somewhere, and we actually\nneed to do something better with them.\n\n586\n00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.090\nSo what are some of the issues\nthat we could consider Dr Omwansa\n\n587\n00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.650\nin terms of disposal?\n\n588\n00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:13.460\n>> Truth be told,\nit's not a permanent device, so\n\n589\n00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.340\nsomewhere along the way\nit'll get worn out.\n\n590\n00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.360\nBut even when computers get worn out,\n\n591\n00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.150\nnot everything on the computer\nhas gotten worn out.\n\n592\n00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.960\nProbably the mouse can be\nused in another computer.\n\n593\n00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.930\nSo there's some things that\nyou can actually move from\n\n594\n00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:27.830\none computer to another.\n\n595\n00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:29.080\nAnd the things like memory,\n\n596\n00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:34.130\nthings that can be detached,\nif they can fit in your kind of device.\n\n597\n00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:38.290\nNot all technology can be migrated\nfrom one device to another.\n\n598\n00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.860\nThink about keyboards, they can be used.\n\n599\n00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.690\nIn some cases,\n\n600\n00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.565\nyou maybe want to think about reusing some\nof the devices for purposes of training.\n\n601\n00:35:45.565 --> 00:35:50.300\nWe were demonstrating a few features here,\nlike hard disks.\n\n602\n00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.790\nWe didn't have to go to a shop to\nbuy a hard disk only to demonstrate.\n\n603\n00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.505\nWe could use old ones.\n\n604\n00:35:55.505 --> 00:36:00.480\nBut more importantly, I think you need\nto understand what the regulation\n\n605\n00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.880\nin your context is about disposal.\n\n606\n00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:08.970\nKeep in mind that some things are created\nusing very sensitive chemicals,\n\n607\n00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:14.010\nthat if you dispose of them or you burn\nthem, they can cause a lot of pollution.\n\n608\n00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.410\nSo you want to know what\nthe regulation is about disposal.\n\n609\n00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:22.232\nI hear of disposal acts that\nprovide guidance on how we dispose.\n\n610\n00:36:22.232 --> 00:36:26.910\nThere are some things that can be recycled\nand there are regulations about recycling.\n\n611\n00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:31.740\nSo more important for me is to let you\nknow that you need to investigate what\n\n612\n00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.780\nthe regulations and the guidelines for\ndisposal are in your context,\n\n613\n00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.240\nand as much as possible, try to reuse.\n\n614\n00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.250\nLooking right now behind my back,\n\n615\n00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.660\nI can see some things that\nlook like have been recycled.\n\n616\n00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.620\nSo Ronnie, looks like you're\nreally smart about these things.\n\n617\n00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.824\nYou don't just wanna throw things around,\nyou can hack them,\n\n618\n00:36:50.824 --> 00:36:54.210\nthe wall looks very nice, but\nit is just a reflection of some things\n\n619\n00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.800\nalready recycled\n>> Right there is a lot of things that\n\n620\n00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.410\nare recycled and reused so that we do\nnot make as much trash as possible.\n\n621\n00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.750\nComputer systems,\n\n622\n00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:07.370\nwhen you do just regularly dump them\ninto the garbage can and the trash can.\n\n623\n00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:10.530\nYou do have to worry about\nthose components that may again\n\n624\n00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:13.280\nactually leech materials\nout into your groundwater.\n\n625\n00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.430\nSo we wanna reuse as much as possible,\nand recycle as much as possible.\n\n626\n00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:22.340\nSo, a lot of times you can re-donate\nyour older computer systems to help,\n\n627\n00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.930\nmaybe another organization.\n\n628\n00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.349\nIt doesn't mean that\nthe computer system is bad,\n\n629\n00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:30.080\nit just means that you wanna\nre-purpose that particular machine.\n\n630\n00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.080\nOr, if you can,\ninclude it into something else.\n\n631\n00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.312\nBut ultimately, in the end, if you do\nneed to dispose of it because of some\n\n632\n00:37:37.312 --> 00:37:41.775\nregulation that says your business is\nnot to donate this or to give this away.\n\n633\n00:37:41.775 --> 00:37:46.326\nThen make sure you follow those local\nprocedures for getting rid of those\n\n634\n00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:50.552\ncomputer systems and follow them\nproperly is pretty much the key.\n\n635\n00:37:50.552 --> 00:37:54.089\nDr. Omwansa, that pretty much seems\nlike the idea here of understanding\n\n636\n00:37:54.089 --> 00:37:56.333\nat least the environmental\nconcerns as well.\n\n637\n00:37:56.333 --> 00:37:58.625\nAny last words?.\n\n638\n00:37:58.625 --> 00:38:04.615\n>> Well I think that in parting\nwe've learned quite a bit.\n\n639\n00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:09.500\nAnd there are things that of course\nare peculiar to our context and\n\n640\n00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.730\nit's important that we learn about them.\n\n641\n00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:16.500\nBe safe, be productive,\nthat's what I will tell you.\n\n642\n00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.130\n>> All right, well that's a great\nplace for us to end this episode then.\n\n643\n00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:23.040\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n644\n00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.180\n>> And my name is Dr.\n\n645\n00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.630\nTonny Omwansa, thinking about\nthe context for utilizing computers.\n\n646\n00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:33.240\nAnd making sure we are safe and\nwe are appropriately using technology.\n\n647\n00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.934\n>> Thank you very much for joining us for\nComputer Fundamentals, and\n\n648\n00:38:37.934 --> 00:38:39.356\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n649\n00:38:39.356 --> 00:38:44.777\n[SOUND]\n\n",
