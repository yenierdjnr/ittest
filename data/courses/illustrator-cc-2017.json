Hello.\nI'm feeling very expert-y.\n\n12\n00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Y'all make me feel so\n\n13\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.310\nsmart with that title.\n\n14\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.260\nI love it.\n\n15\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.960\nI love it.\n\n16\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.830\nBut yes, so excited.\n\n17\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.580\nI love Illustrator.\n\n18\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n19\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.740\nYou know, I know,\n\n20\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.970\nIllustrator is Is our fave.\nWe've been together for a while.\n\n21\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.100\n&gt;&gt; We have a history.\n\n22\n00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo you know how much I love this product\n\n23\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.340\nand I know how much you love this product\nand this is our introduction Correct.\n\n24\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna start from scratch\n\n25\n00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.287\nlike assuming no knowledge,\nyou don't know what even does.\n\n26\n00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:06.098\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n27\n00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:09.658\nwell, you are going to help that.\n\n28\n00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:12.238\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's your job now string over.\n\n29\n00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, take over here.\n\n30\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.252\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n31\n00:01:15.252 --> 00:01:18.890\nTalk about She is great about\ninterjecting and adding her own tips.\n\n32\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.230\nAnd Vonne was my teacher first, so\nthat's kind of the funny story here,\n\n33\n00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.600\nthat the student becomes the teacher.\n\n34\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.550\nBut yes, as we discussed,\nIllustrator is just a fantastic program.\n\n35\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.390\nIt's definitely something where, if I can\njump into one of the Adobe programs, and\n\n36\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.190\nI can do anything In any program, each\none of them kinda has their own niche.\n\n37\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.730\nWe'll get into that.\n\n38\n00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.360\nIllustrator is always\ngonna be my first choice.\n\n39\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.190\nIt's just gonna be kinda my go-to program.\n\n40\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.080\nBecause it's just fun.\n\n41\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.800\nIt's fun, and\n\n42\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.560\nfeel like it's one of the ones that\ncan be a little bit easier to learn.\n\n43\n00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.890\nSo that's kind of a nice thing with it.\n\n44\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.070\n&gt;&gt; It's slightly more\nintuitive in the sense that\n\n45\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.990\n&gt;&gt; Paint, you know when we all first got\n\n46\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.580\nour computers back in the day, gosh,\nI'm showing my age already [LAUGH] Well,\n\n47\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.970\nyou know you had to like,\nI can draw with a paint brush and\n\n48\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.980\nyou go ahead and pick a color and\nthings like that.\n\n49\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.970\nSo I feel like it's kinda\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like the new\n\n50\n00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.350\ngraduated person if you want to say\nfrom like the little baby Paint and\n\n51\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.110\nnow it's in illustrator and\nwhat you can do with it.\n\n52\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.160\nSo I think that's the thing that people\nmaybe feel more comfortable with.\n\n53\n00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; If you've grown up with computers or\n\n54\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.330\nanything like that.\n\n55\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think that's a great example.\n\n56\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.760\nTo kind of explain what that means let's\ngo ahead and take a look at my screen now.\n\n57\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.160\nI don't have Illustrator open.\n\n58\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.920\nWe are looking at something\nthat I created in Illustrator,\n\n59\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.460\nbut we're just gonna look at\nit as a PDF for right now.\n\n60\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.140\nSo you kind of are seeing some words,\nvector, raster.\n\n61\n00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.820\nIt's like, what does that mean?\n\n62\n00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.250\nAnd if you've never opened up\nIllustrator before, You may not know.\n\n63\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.100\nEven if you have, you may not\nnecessarily know what you're creating.\n\n64\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.000\nSo Illustrator is a vector based program.\n\n65\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.540\nNow what does that mean?\n\n66\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.060\nBasically, the reason why we use\nIllustrator, especially for something like\n\n67\n00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.310\na logo is because With a vector-based\nprogram, it's all based up on math.\n\n68\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.560\nWhich you're probably thinking,\nlike I am, no, I'm in the wrong spot.\n\n69\n00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.970\nThis is not why I came to\nthis job was to do math.\n\n70\n00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.550\nWell, the computer program\ndoes all the math for you, but\n\n71\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.310\nit makes everything infinitely scalable.\n\n72\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.670\nNow compare that to\nsomething like an image.\n\n73\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.680\nSo if I'm making an image in Photoshop,\nAll that is based on pixels.\n\n74\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.330\nSo if you kinda look at\nthis raster versus vector.\n\n75\n00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.810\nKinda looking at what that means.\n\n76\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.350\nSo raster based images,\nalso known as bitmap,\n\n77\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.750\nare all gonna be things that\nreally depend on resolution.\n\n78\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.720\nAnd you can think about, okay,\nit's built up on this many pixels.\n\n79\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.130\nIf I try and blow it up you're\ngonna get that pixellated effect.\n\n80\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.910\nEven if you're new to the concept of\nresolution you've probably seen something\n\n81\n00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.230\nthat looks a little bit\npixellated before in your life.\n\n82\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.300\nRight?\n\n83\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n84\n00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.800\n&gt;&gt; And you might even see this on social\n\n85\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.970\nmedia or anywhere that you\nhave images on a screen or\n\n86\n00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.940\neven in a printed material\nwhere it just looks.\n\n87\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.950\nFuzzy-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n88\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.800\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look clear and\nit's pixellated.\n\n89\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.840\nAnd these are just kind of, I feel,\ncommon terms that nowadays that we\n\n90\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.295\nhave with anything that involves an image,\nthat maybe you've even heard of a j.\n\n91\n00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:14.205\nFile we threw some file formats up there.\n\n92\n00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:16.725\nDon't have to worry about what\neach one of them means, but\n\n93\n00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:20.375\nyou might of heard of a jpg file because\nwe're always sharing pictures and\n\n94\n00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:23.935\nposting them on Instagram or\nFacebook or anywhere else like that and\n\n95\n00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:28.340\nsharing it like that So,\nhopefully you're somewhat familiar with\n\n96\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.930\nthat type of information of\nthat particular type of file,\n\n97\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.205\nand now you have a fancy term,\nthat that is a raster based file format.\n\n98\n00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:38.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah we're just here for\n\n99\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.655\nthe fancy terms, really.\n\n100\n00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:40.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, exactly,\n\n101\n00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.080\nI think Vonne made a good point,\n\n102\n00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.900\nin the digital age, you\n&gt;&gt; Probably have something like\n\n103\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.450\na smart phone.\n\n104\n00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.340\nSo if I take a picture on my iPhone,\nI'm taking a JPEG image to share.\n\n105\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.415\nI think it's a JPEG,\nI'm gonna go with a JPEG.\n\n106\n00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:53.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those that\n\n107\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.060\nyou're looking at here, basically.\n\n108\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.515\nSo it is something.\n\n109\n00:04:56.515 --> 00:04:59.215\n&gt;&gt; Something that you're probably\nare seeing a little bit more commonly now\n\n110\n00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.045\nthan maybe even 10 years ago.\n\n111\n00:05:01.045 --> 00:05:03.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and maybe,\nas we keep on this train, right.\n\n112\n00:05:03.895 --> 00:05:08.185\nI don't know, with my phone I go\nto share picture or I send it,\n\n113\n00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:13.205\nsometimes it pops up with like, do you\nwanna send it as small, medium or large.\n\n114\n00:05:13.205 --> 00:05:16.895\nYou see that a lot, and\nyou are like, I don't know.\n\n115\n00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:18.885\nThat goes back to the whole\nthing that you talked about,\n\n116\n00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:24.070\nthe resolution, All of these\npixels that make up your image.\n\n117\n00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.850\nWell there's amount of pixels, and\n\n118\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.170\nhow much stuff it has in it\nmakes the file size bigger.\n\n119\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.750\nAnd so that's why it's asking you what\nsize, of the small, medium, and large,\n\n120\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.540\nbecause it does something\nthen it's resampling.\n\n121\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.830\nJust go okay sure, that's fine.\n\n122\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.770\nWhatever that means.\n\n123\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.690\nIt's just gonna change\nthe number of pixels but\n\n124\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.660\nit does equate to how large\nthe file itself goes.\n\n125\n00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.270\nSo even if you don't know anything about\n\n126\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.860\nall that stuff you've probably seen\nthat and that's what it's talking about.\n\n127\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyeah exactly that's was a great example.\n\n128\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.630\nThat was the moment I was thinking of\nwhen I thought of you've probably said\n\n129\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.180\nthe JPEG.\n\n130\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.700\nSo yes I'm glad you expanded on that.\n\n131\n00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.950\nSo yeah that's all our\nroster based information.\n\n132\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.840\nNow- Illustrator,\n\n133\n00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.700\nthe one program we're talking about\nhere is a vector-based program.\n\n134\n00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.170\nSo it's basically kind of\nlike the opposite of that.\n\n135\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.230\nNow there is some rounds and\n\n136\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.120\nstuff that can go in there but\nthat's a different story.\n\n137\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.730\nWe'll just leave it at that.\n\n138\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.000\nSo with our vectors, we have everything\nknown as Pass, there are no pixels.\n\n139\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.010\nAnd as I mentioned,\nthis is resolution independent.\n\n140\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.060\nAnd also fun fact, I just noticed that\nthis is spanning onto two lines, and\n\n141\n00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.580\nit's driving me crazy [LAUGH].\n\n142\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.280\nSo we do not have to work with resolution\nlike we do in our raster based images.\n\n143\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.350\nSo it's very different from an image\nthat you take on your phone or\n\n144\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.640\nsomething like that.\n\n145\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.760\nAnd Illustrator is going to be\nthe program that we would use.\n\n146\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.510\nTo create these raster graphics.\n\n147\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.730\nNow, when we look at something like that,\nokay,\n\n148\n00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.920\nif I kinda move over here we have our\nvectors, as I said, vectors are all based\n\n149\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.720\non a mathematical formula that is going\nto allow them to be infinitely scalable.\n\n150\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.340\nSo, I kinda mentioned this example before,\n\n151\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.930\nbut, Illustrator is a common program\nthat I would use to create a logo.\n\n152\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.660\nNow why would I use\nIllustrator to create a logo?\n\n153\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.170\nThat's probably something that I need to\nhave in several different sizes, right?\n\n154\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.170\nSo, you can think about a logo on\nsomething as small as a pen, and then,\n\n155\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.880\nokay, a pocket square of a T-shirt,\nor kinda labeled on a T-shirt.\n\n156\n00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.670\nThen I need something as\nlarge as a billboard.\n\n157\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.740\nI can create that infinitely,\nscalable graphic in Illustrator.\n\n158\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.720\nIf I were trying to make that\nup with pixels in Photoshop,\n\n159\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.220\nit would get pixellated.\n\n160\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.190\nYou know,\nthat resolution would start to look fuzzy.\n\n161\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.240\nI think fuzzy is a great word for\ndescribing it.\n\n162\n00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.100\nAnd a lot of times,\njust kind of a fun fact,\n\n163\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:39.340\noften times this utilizes a smaller file\nsize because we don't have those pixels.\n\n164\n00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.180\nAnd that resolution that information for\nthe computer to kind of remember\n\n165\n00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.880\nwe are basically all just\nworking of mathematical formula.\n\n166\n00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.780\nNow I have this graphic here don't\nlet this you know scare you or\n\n167\n00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.090\nanything like that but I basically just\nwanna explain the types of things that we\n\n168\n00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.360\nare gonna be looking at in illustrator.\n\n169\n00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.900\nSo I think I mentioned the word\nalready illustrator, in.\n\n170\n00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.170\nBleh.\n[LAUGH] Illustrator creates what's known\n\n171\n00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.800\nas paths.\n\n172\n00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.830\nSo, typically when we're referring\nto an object like a triangle,\n\n173\n00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.370\nlike what we're looking at here.\n\n174\n00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.490\nTechnically it's going to\nbe referred to as a path.\n\n175\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.830\nYou may hear us use the word object,\nor something kind of similar to that.\n\n176\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.980\nAnd then our paths are based off of these.\n\n177\n00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.120\nPoints, so you're going to see that we\nhave this point here, this point here.\n\n178\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.710\nthis point here.\n\n179\n00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.140\nA triangle's naturally going to be\nthree points, a square might be four,\n\n180\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:25.800\nsomething like that.\n\n181\n00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.320\nYou can kind of see how that would work,\n\n182\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.600\njust based of the idea of just drawing\na square, you have four corners.\n\n183\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.560\nYou're probably gonna have\na corner in each point.\n\n184\n00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.580\nYou could have more,\nwe'll kinda get into that.\n\n185\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.390\nAnd then we also,\n\n186\n00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.230\nwith our color, we typically have\nwhat's known as a fill versus a stroke.\n\n187\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.640\nSo what we're looking at here,\nthis is known as our Fill color,\n\n188\n00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.900\nwhere we have kinda that teal there.\n\n189\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.060\nAnd then we also have this stroke\nwhere we have that kind of\n\n190\n00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.940\noutside border along there with it.\n\n191\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.820\nSo this is predominantly the type\nof thing that you're gonna\n\n192\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.980\nbe looking at in Illustrator.\n\n193\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.770\n&gt;&gt; And here we're really just trying\nto introduce you to the terms.\n\n194\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.710\nFill.\nStroke.\n\n195\n00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.350\nPoints.\n\n196\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.620\nPaths.\n\n197\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.590\nLike she said, we'll kinda refer to\nthem as shapes, cuz it is a shape.\n\n198\n00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.400\nA triangle is a shape, but\ntechnically it's a path.\n\n199\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.890\nAnd even more technically,\n\n200\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.700\nit's a closed path versus an open path,\na line that has two points.\n\n201\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.880\nThen that's an open path and\nthis is a closed path.\n\n202\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.590\nSo you can see in the inside fill,\noutside stroke.\n\n203\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.170\nAnd we even say the inside\ncolor sometimes.\n\n204\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.910\nWe kind of use it interchangeably\nof We commonly referred to in our\n\n205\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.630\nregular vocabulary versus\nthe technical definitions of\n\n206\n00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.730\nthe make up a path and everything.\n\n207\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.150\nAnd if this is harking back to some of\nyour geometry lessons and everything and\n\n208\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.700\nmaybe you're like, gosh I'm so scared.\n\n209\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.980\nGeometry actually my favorite\n\n210\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.248\nmath class ever because\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n211\n00:09:49.248 --> 00:09:50.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; we made shapes.\n\n212\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.820\nSo I was kinda excited.\n\n213\n00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.275\nThe proofs were a little weird but\nI still like those too.\n\n214\n00:09:54.275 --> 00:09:56.752\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Geometry was not my favorite\n\n215\n00:09:56.752 --> 00:09:57.270\nsubject\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.290\n&gt;&gt; In school, and I still like working in\n\n217\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.545\nIllustrator Working in Illustrator, so\neven if you're not crazy like Vonne and\n\n218\n00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:06.935\nlove geometry, you will still,\nI think, enjoy it.\n\n219\n00:10:06.935 --> 00:10:11.275\nTrust me and I really think Vonne made a\ngreat point earlier, it kind of harks back\n\n220\n00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:14.670\nto some of that almost childhood\n&gt;&gt; Painting,\n\n221\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.070\ndrawing a square, drawing a triangle.\n\n222\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.030\nThat's a lot of the stuff, especially\nwhen we're first getting started in\n\n223\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.610\nIllustrator, that we're gonna be doing.\n\n224\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.200\nSo I really think that it will\nbe kinda fun in that regard.\n\n225\n00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.190\nNow I'm sure we'll have a couple\nother things to add, but\n\n226\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.400\nI don't wanna miss the common uses here.\n\n227\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.860\nTypically, a lot of times people want\nto know the common uses of the various\n\n228\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.110\ndifferent programs, so we went ahead and\nlisted a couple of them here.\n\n229\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.610\nObviously, I have a lot more for\n\n230\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.200\nIllustrator just cause we're\ntalking about Illustrator.\n\n231\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.120\nI'm not saying that Photoshop and\nInDesign are just limited to those\n\n232\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.060\nThose couple things nor is illustrator\nlook-limited to just these couple things.\n\n233\n00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.650\nBut all right, typically, your gonna\nuse illustrator to create graphics, so\n\n234\n00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.780\nyou can think about okay,\na logo, I've got a map.\n\n235\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.560\nIllustrations, if I'm doing some\nsort of a cartoon Soon or drawing.\n\n236\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.820\nInfographics, you might use Illustrator to\ncreate the infographic in its entirety or\n\n237\n00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.720\nmaybe you use Illustrator to create just\nthe little pieces of an infographic.\n\n238\n00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.350\nAnd then kind of compile it in\na different program, which is yeah.\n\n239\n00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.200\n&gt;&gt; A little more complicated but yeah,\nit is something that you could do.\n\n240\n00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nif your like what's an infographic?\n\n241\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of all the rage right now or\n\n242\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:27.510\nmaybe it's all rage for\nus cuz we're in the design world but\n\n243\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.850\nyou see them even in social media.\n\n244\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.810\nWhere it's A lot of times like a long\ngraphic and it's being able to\n\n245\n00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:40.420\nmake information into\na visual format where it\n\n246\n00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.850\nhas chats and graphs and\nlike 40% of all bunnies are gray.\n\n247\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.170\nThose types of things and then it has like\nlittle bunnies here and like little furs\n\n248\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:54.340\nand everything all colors and It's very,\nwhat you call, flat colors all the time.\n\n249\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; When we say flat colors,\n\n250\n00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.560\nthere's no shading and\ngrades, like right here.\n\n251\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.540\nThis is flat colors.\n\n252\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.084\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's all flat colors.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's all teal,\n\n253\n00:12:03.084 --> 00:12:05.023\nyou got some purples in the corners and\n\n254\n00:12:05.023 --> 00:12:07.758\nsome yellows Again we're\nthrowing up design terms.\n\n255\n00:12:07.758 --> 00:12:09.803\nThat maybe you haven't heard of but\n\n256\n00:12:09.803 --> 00:12:12.975\njust trying to get you talking\nthe lingo of a designer.\n\n257\n00:12:12.975 --> 00:12:15.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like, is she gonna go lingo?\n\n258\n00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.480\nHow far out is she gonna go?\n\n259\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.480\nI like it, I like it.\n\n260\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.940\nOkay, but yeah I agree.\n\n261\n00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.753\nThose are all just kinda terms that we\nwill probably discuss throughout this\n\n262\n00:12:23.753 --> 00:12:27.641\nshow, talking about all those things,\nlike flat color and stuff like that.\n\n263\n00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:31.518\nAnd you can see, we have some other\nexamples listed here, T-shirts, flyers,\n\n264\n00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:33.182\na lot of times for a business card.\n\n265\n00:12:33.182 --> 00:12:36.543\nI'll mock up the initial\nbusiness card in Illustrator And\n\n266\n00:12:36.543 --> 00:12:41.385\nthen maybe move it into In Design and\nuse some of the skills that you can there.\n\n267\n00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:46.294\nInDesign to kind of lead into that is\nmore of a multi page layout program.\n\n268\n00:12:46.294 --> 00:12:49.418\nIt is something where if I was\ntasked with designing a book or\n\n269\n00:12:49.418 --> 00:12:52.800\nreally anything that was more\nthan probably two or three pages.\n\n270\n00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.510\nI would definitely use In Design for\nthat because that's What it's set up for.\n\n271\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.650\nIt's set up to handle a lot of text and\n\n272\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.100\na lot of content, including images and\nthings like that.\n\n273\n00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.730\nNow Photoshop, Photoshop I feel like is\nalways the name people know, right and so\n\n274\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.760\na lot of times people kinda have\nan idea about that program.\n\n275\n00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.000\nWell Photoshop at it's core\nis an image Editing programs.\n\n276\n00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.180\nI think a lot of times\npeople do use Photoshop for\n\n277\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.330\nthings that they really\nshould use Illustrator for.\n\n278\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.660\nEspecially, if they're just starting\n[INAUDIBLE] kinda new to the program.\n\n279\n00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.640\nHopefully, we can kinda show you.\n\n280\n00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.790\nAnd may be if you are one of those\nphotoshoppers we can kinda take\n\n281\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.960\nyou from that.\n\n282\n00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.660\nAnd take you into Illustrator at least for\n\n283\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.030\nthe things that Illustrator\nshould be used for.\n\n284\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.162\nI am definitely an advocate for\nusing each program properly.\n\n285\n00:13:39.162 --> 00:13:42.588\nYou know if I am working on a logo then\nthat's something I'm gonna make in\n\n286\n00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:45.239\nIllustrator and\nthen you know maybe if I wanna go ahead.\n\n287\n00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:48.653\nAnd add that to an image or\nadd that to a website mock up,\n\n288\n00:13:48.653 --> 00:13:52.400\nwhich I could do a website\nmock up in Illustrator too.\n\n289\n00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.830\nI just know a lot of people use that for\n\n290\n00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.260\nPhotoshop maybe then I would\ntake that into Photoshop, but\n\n291\n00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.205\nyou have to use each thing properly for\nwhat it What it was designed for.\n\n292\n00:14:01.205 --> 00:14:03.346\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, I couldn't agree more.\n\n293\n00:14:03.346 --> 00:14:06.632\nLike Photoshop, I would do,\nsay I took some pictures, but\n\n294\n00:14:06.632 --> 00:14:09.674\nthey're kind of dark and\nI wanna change the contrast.\n\n295\n00:14:09.674 --> 00:14:14.271\nAnd the shadow and highlights and\nI need to get rid of that big old\n\n296\n00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:16.067\npimple on my face [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n297\n00:14:16.067 --> 00:14:18.336\n&gt;&gt; You go ahead and\nuse Photoshop to edit the image.\n\n298\n00:14:18.336 --> 00:14:21.335\nI would use illustrator\nto create the logo for\n\n299\n00:14:21.335 --> 00:14:25.850\nthe company in it's vector format like\nyou said, to be able to put on a T-shirt,\n\n300\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.250\na pen, all of our logos,\nthey're all done in Illustrator.\n\n301\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then put it onside a building but\n\n302\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.310\nthen designing a four page brochure,\n\n303\n00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.850\nyou then take those edited images you did\nin Photoshop, put them into InDesign.\n\n304\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.880\nTake that logo you made from Illustrator,\nput it into InDesign and\n\n305\n00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.060\nthen it all works together.\n\n306\n00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.780\nThere's a reason why this is a suite\nof applications within the Adobe CC\n\n307\n00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.350\nsubscription that you need to use it.\n\n308\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.210\nProperly for each job.\n\n309\n00:14:49.210 -->

format and\n\n314\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.670\nbe able to then blow it up on the side\nof a building and everything.\n\n315\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.290\nIt'd be great, so, yes, excellent

[LAUGH] All right I will.\n\n54\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.870\nSo I'm gonna jump on down into our file.\n\n55\n00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.440\nThis is resolution file type dot AI, you\nwill have an option to have this as well.\n\n56\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.440\nI'm gonna start here.\n\n57\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.080\nSo, resolution, we've talked about this\nin our introduction to Illustrator.\n\n58\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.750\nAnd what does it actually mean?\n\n59\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.600\nWhen we talk about resolution here in\nthe world of graphic design and graphics,\n\n60\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.590\nwe're talking about PPI, pixels per inch.\n\n61\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.186\nYou maybe have heard this\nbeing referred to as DPI,\n\n62\n00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:51.400\ndos per inch, dots pixels, okay, sure.\n\n63\n00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.478\nI'll let you say whatever which one,\ntechnically they're not the same,\n\n64\n00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:58.130\noka,y because cuz your screen and\n\n65\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.550\nthe information is in pixels,\ndots is when we're talking about printers.\n\n66\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.870\nPrinters usually have a resolution and\nthings like that.\n\n67\n00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.536\nSo, that's okay, we'll let it go.\n\n68\n00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:08.944\nAnd the other thing is in\na regular terminology,\n\n69\n00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:13.681\nthe word resolution gets thrown\ninto things like televisions, and\n\n70\n00:03:13.681 --> 00:03:17.270\nit's all in HD and that 4K and\nall of that, right?\n\n71\n00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.716\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea what that means.\n\n72\n00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:22.670\nYes, fancy.\n&gt;&gt; And it's all these bigger numbers, and\n\n73\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.500\nthey always say the bigger the better,\nlook at the quality.\n\n74\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.180\nSo people don't sometimes think\nof resolution equates to quality.\n\n75\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.680\nSure for televisions or\nthings like that, but files and\n\n76\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.500\nimages, that's not necessarily the case.\n\n77\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.320\nNot always more is better, it's\nknowing about what right file type for\n\n78\n00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.150\nthe medium and\nalso the right resolution for your medium.\n\n79\n00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.640\nAre you working in print,\ncommercial printing,\n\n80\n00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.510\nare you working in web on your screen?\n\n81\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.100\nYou don't have the same resolution for\nboth, and\n\n82\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.660\nif you're using a screen resolution for\nyour commercial printing,\n\n83\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.740\nyour printer's gonna be\nlike this ain't gonna work.\n\n84\n00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.630\nAnd so\nthat's where you need to know about it.\n\n85\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.930\nAlso in the world of resolution,\n\n86\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.560\nyou do have to kind of throw in the total\nnumber of pixels within a file.\n\n87\n00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.500\nBecause if you don't have a lot\nof information to work with and\n\n88\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.710\nyou can't bump up\nthe resolution properly and\n\n89\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.990\nbe able to have it work right, you\ndon't have enough pixels to start with.\n\n90\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.570\nI just wanted to throw over here\ninto some of our exercise files.\n\n91\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.860\nOllie, good old Ollie, right?\n\n92\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.260\nSuch a cute little guy.\n\n93\n00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.356\n[LAUGH] So we have this and this is\na picture from your iPhone, I believe.\n\n94\n00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:42.037\nWell, I know it's from you iPhone\nsince I saw your information.\n\n95\n00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:43.025\n&gt;&gt; You saw [INAUDIBLE].\n\n96\n00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:45.408\n&gt;&gt; So right here, what you can do\non that is you can go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:45.408 --> 00:04:46.480\nget the info of a file.\n\n98\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.100\nAnd you can see that I've got some\ndimensions right here of 2400 by 3200\n\n99\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.730\npixel, that's a big,\nthat's a lot of pixels, that's good.\n\n100\n00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.912\nThat's good for somebody like me, that if\nI'm going to put Ollie in the front cover\n\n101\n00:04:59.912 --> 00:05:02.027\nof the magazine of cat fancy or whatever.\n\n102\n00:05:02.027 --> 00:05:06.716\nI have to have a lot of information\nto be able to get the total\n\n103\n00:05:06.716 --> 00:05:11.620\nnumber of pixels Compress down\ninto the proper resolution.\n\n104\n00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.150\nAnd if you're doing it right, that\nmeans the actual dimensions, the file,\n\n105\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.960\nnot necessarily the files, it's the width\nand height is going to get smaller.\n\n106\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.015\nSo that's something known as resampling,\n\n107\n00:05:22.015 --> 00:05:26.185\nit gets a little further off than I\nnecessarily want to get to in this lesson.\n\n108\n00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:29.215\nBecause I can get really far in the weeds,\nbut\n\n109\n00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:34.945\nthe number of pixels definitely equates to\nsomething we can do with how much we can\n\n110\n00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:37.465\nchange the resolution and\nthat's what we gonna do.\n\n111\n00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:38.275\nAnd the other thing,\n\n112\n00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:40.847\nif you're talking about web, and\nthat kind of goes down into here.\n\n113\n00:05:40.847 --> 00:05:43.193\nI'm gonna jump down a little bit here.\n\n114\n00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:48.550\nThe image dimensions width and height,\nthose are your pixel dimensions.\n\n115\n00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.077\nThat 3200 or 2400, whatever those numbers\nare that I've already forgotten about\n\n116\n00:05:52.077 --> 00:05:54.950\n[LAUGH], that's gonna be how much\nit's going to take up in the screen.\n\n117\n00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.930\nSo if you're sizing images for\n\n118\n00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.090\nweb, yes, you do have to have\nthe magic number of 72 PPI.\n\n119\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.240\nBut even more important with that,\nif it's 600 by 400 pixels,\n\n120\n00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.890\nthat's the space it's going\nto occupy on your website.\n\n121\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.350\nSo throwing that in, and of course,\n\n122\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.070\nwhy do we want to have less\ntotal pixels and information?\n\n123\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.450\nCuz you want files to load fast.\n\n124\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.470\nThat's what you want on a website\nis images to load fast.\n\n125\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.587\nI'm sure we've all gone to a website,\nwhere it's like wait, wait, wait, picture.\n\n126\n00:06:25.587 --> 00:06:29.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wait, pause,\npause, okay, got it.\n\n127\n00:06:29.175 --> 00:06:30.339\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they didn't\n\n128\n00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.987\noptimize their graphics properly\nto make sure that this file size,\n\n129\n00:06:33.987 --> 00:06:36.360\ncuz you can make it\nsmaller in some program.\n\n130\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.273\nAnd even with the dimensions\nin [INAUDIBLE] coding, but\n\n131\n00:06:40.273 --> 00:06:44.460\nthat's not the true file size\nthat's kind of important.\n\n132\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.700\nAll right, that's there.\n\n133\n00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.720\nNow we kinda go on this web\nversus print right here.\n\n134\n00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.680\n72 is the magic number for\nweb design or webfiles,\n\n135\n00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.910\n300 is the magic number for\ncommercial printing.\n\n136\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.670\nNormally, there\nare exceptions to the rule.\n\n137\n00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:05.090\nSome might accept 150 or 225, so you have\nto look at their print specifications.\n\n138\n00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.600\nBut this is in general terms,\n300 is the magic number for print.\n\n139\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.500\nSo that's that whole making sure you have\nenough pixels to get this resolution up\n\n140\n00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.300\nand have everything working properly.\n\n141\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.280\n&gt;&gt; Now if I'm gonna be doing\nsomething where I'm printing on\n\n142\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.900\njust a home office printer.\n\n143\n00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.160\nIs this something that I really\nneed to be concerned about?\n\n144\n00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.475\n&gt;&gt; That's such a great question.\n\n145\n00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:26.390\n[LAUGH] No, you don't.\n\n146\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.397\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n147\n00:07:27.397 --> 00:07:31.670\nthat's where a lot of your home printers,\nit's gonna do all the translations and\n\n148\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.390\neverything for you and\nI just kind of print it out nicely.\n\n149\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.730\nSo yes, definitely specifying\nthis as commercial printing.\n\n150\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.330\nThat you're printing on a press and\noffset press,\n\n151\n00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.880\nall those wonderful things that\nget you into the print world.\n\n152\n00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.390\nThat's the number they're\nprobably going to want.\n\n153\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.580\nThe other thing with print, they're gonna\nprobably want it in a CMYK color mode.\n\n154\n00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.490\nCyan, magenta, yellow, and black.\n\n155\n00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.080\nThose are your ink colors\nthat are using this.\n\n156\n00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.076\nWe'll talk about this as process colors\nsomewhere else in these episodes.\n\n157\n00:08:00.076 --> 00:08:04.989\nBut the image information has\nto be in CMYK to translate.\n\n158\n00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:09.037\nAgain For regular home use,\nkeep it in RGB.\n\n159\n00:08:09.037 --> 00:08:12.720\nYou only switch things in the CMYK for\ncommercial printing.\n\n160\n00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.540\nEverything else,\nstay in RGB and that's fine.\n\n161\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.250\nYou can see over on the web\nside that we have RGB there.\n\n162\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:24.020\nAnd then, you can see some other things\nwith your common file types that you want\n\n163\n00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:30.680\nto have for each side of the aisle, if you\nwanna say, of what the web and the print.\n\n164\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.168\nYou want to generally keep it\nin JPEGs GIFs, pings or PNGs.\n\n165\n00:08:35.168 --> 00:08:36.015\nThe SVG.\n\n166\n00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:36.932\nIllusive SVG.\n\n167\n00:08:36.932 --> 00:08:38.213\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's so fancy [LAUGH].\n\n168\n00:08:38.213 --> 00:08:41.876\n&gt;&gt; And on the print side,\nwe want to go ahead and\n\n169\n00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:45.051\nstick with the TIF, or an EPS or a PDF.\n\n170\n00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:46.750\nThose are just in general terms.\n\n171\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.320\nScrolling on down a little bit just\nto give you some basic definitions,\n\n172\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.350\nif you want to say, the properties of each\nfile format as to why we want to do that.\n\n173\n00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.590\nLet's stick on the web side for right now.\n\n174\n00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.110\nNow, you can see I've got a little\nbit of a list right here.\n\n175\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.816\nLet's zoom back in and JPEG,\n\n176\n00:09:02.816 --> 00:09:06.790\nprobably one we're probably\nall very familiar with, right?\n\n177\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.900\nJoint Photographic Experts Group,\nyeah, that's what it is.\n\n178\n00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.180\n&gt;&gt; I am so impressed with that.\n\n179\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.690\nThis is why you're here.\n\n180\n00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.250\nYes, thank you.\n\n181\n00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:21.880\n&gt;&gt; So there usually is an E in there,\nlike sometimes you might see it as\n\n182\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.490\ndot J-P-E-G like a four letter extension\nrather than a three letter extension.\n\n183\n00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.750\nBut jpeg and\njpg is usually the normal one.\n\n184\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.650\nBut that's what it stands for.\n\n185\n00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.500\nThis is the one we're all\nprobably accustomed to.\n\n186\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.430\nUse it for photos.\n\n187\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.320\nWhy?\nIt has 16 million color support,\n\n188\n00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.834\nas opposed to let's just kinda quickly\njump down to the .GIF file format.\n\n189\n00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:46.720\n.GIF is one that we see a lot\nusually in relation to animation,\n\n190\n00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.270\nlike animated .GIFs and\neverything like that.\n\n191\n00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:54.001\nBut a GIF file only has 256\ncolors that it can support there.\n\n192\n00:09:54.001 --> 00:10:00.350\nSo a lot less color space rather than the\n16 million, or color amount, I should say.\n\n193\n00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.410\nSo that's where you have\ncomparing JPEGs to GIFs there.\n\n194\n00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.250\nAnother big one between these\ntwo file formats, transparency.\n\n195\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.745\nThis is the one where I tell\npeople about the white box, right?\n\n196\n00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I know you've seen it.\n\n200\n00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.000\nYou've put this into a Word document or\nsomething, and\n\n201\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.030\nyou've got a different\ncolor in the background.\n\n202\n00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.550\nPowerPoint's a big one, right?\n\n203\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.430\nYou have a blue background,\nyou put a picture in, and\n\n204\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.640\nyou think it's blank around it,\nbut it's all white.\n\n205\n00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.470\nWhy is that?\n\n206\n00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.140\nThat's because JPEGs, you cannot\nsupport transparency in a JPEG file.\n\n207\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.270\nThere's just no way you can, it's just\nnot part of that particular file format.\n\n208\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:46.090\nBut a GIF, a GIF can support transparency.\n\n209\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.040\nAnd that's where that blankness\nwill be around it and\n\n210\n00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.650\nyou see just the cutout if you wanna\nsay of whatever that information is.\n\n211\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.620\nThat's a big difference here.\n\n212\n00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.550\nThere's no layer support in JPEGs.\n\n213\n00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.410\nI just put that in here\nas opposed to your PSD.\n\n214\n00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.550\nThis is more when I teach in Photoshop.\n\n215\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.260\nCuz I use this kinda same exact\nstructure for teaching in Photoshop.\n\n216\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.520\nLayers are in Photoshop.\n\n217\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.420\nLayers are not in JPEG.\n\n218\n00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.040\nYou just can't have them.\n\n219\n00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.190\nThere is a lossy compression.\n\n220\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.940\nIt does lose some information\nevery time you save a JPEG.\n\n221\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.100\nYou've gotta do this so many times before\nyou see any degradation in quality.\n\n222\n00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.670\nBut it is a lossy,\nlike it loses information.\n\n223\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.750\nBut it compresses it.\n\n224\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.130\nAnd that's what makes it such\na small file format, which is good.\n\n225\n00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.560\nAll right, so coming on down.\n\n226\n00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.710\nWe're staying on the web side for\na little bit.\n\n227\n00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.300\nWith your .GIF file, we've already kinda\ntalked a little bit about that, and\n\n228\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.560\nthat is a graphics interchange file.\n\n229\n00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.290\nAnd there's a debate of whether\nit's a giff or a jiff file.\n\n230\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.098\n&gt;&gt; You know this one, don't you?\n\n231\n00:11:45.098 --> 00:11:45.691\n&gt;&gt; Please.\n\n232\n00:11:45.691 --> 00:11:46.580\nIt's a GIF.\n\n233\n00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.570\nJiff is the peanut butter,\n[LAUGH] I mean, come on.\n\n234\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.650\n&gt;&gt; But the creator of this file\nformat just won like an award,\n\n235\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.695\nlike a web award or something,\nan Internet type of award.\n\n236\n00:11:57.695 --> 00:11:59.905\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd the guy's like it is pronounced GIF.\n\n237\n00:11:59.905 --> 00:12:01.231\n&gt;&gt; Well, sorry, sir.\n\n238\n00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:03.213\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:12:03.213 --> 00:12:04.977\n&gt;&gt; But I'm looking at my cat memes on\n\n240\n00:12:04.977 --> 00:12:06.818\nthe Internet, it's GIF, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:06.818 --> 00:12:08.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so yeah,\n\n242\n00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:13.600\ntomato, tomato,\nyou could debate about that all day long.\n\n243\n00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.060\nBut it is a file format that\nsupports 256 colors, transparency,\n\n244\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.150\nit's an index transparency.\n\n245\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.790\nYou're like what does that mean?\n\n246\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.880\nIt means it's either transparent or not.\n\n247\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.050\nThere's no others, it's on or off.\n\n248\n00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.650\nIt's not any in-between states in there.\n\n249\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.170\nYou don't have to compress a GIF file.\n\n250\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.250\nIt's already small because\nof the color support.\n\n251\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.230\nAnd it is also known as\nan indexed color mode.\n\n252\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.550\nAgain, more for the Photoshop stuff for\nwhen we get into like, okay, RGB and CMYK.\n\n253\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.670\nWell, you can also have\nan index color mode,\n\n254\n00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:50.090\nand that's usually specifically for\nthe GIF file format.\n\n255\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.400\nJust to let you know that.\n\n256\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.410\nAnd then come on down\nto the PNG file format.\n\n257\n00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.980\nThese are,\nI'd say these are used more than the GIF.\n\n258\n00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.020\nI don't know if I'm really saying that or\njust kinda making it up.\n\n259\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:09.470\nBut there are two levels of the PNG file,\nand it's Portable Network Graphic?\n\n260\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.403\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes? Okay, good.\n\n261\n00:13:10.403 --> 00:13:13.016\n&gt;&gt; That one I do know, got it.\n[LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:13:13.016 --> 00:13:17.835\n&gt;&gt; You have an 8-bit, if you wanna say,\n\n263\n00:13:17.835 --> 00:13:23.960\nPNG and a PNG 24.\nThat whole transparency, right?\n\n264\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.770\nOn or off.\n\n265\n00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.190\nWell, a PNG 8 is pretty much\nthe exact same thing as a GIF.\n\n266\n00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.900\nThe exact same thing.\n\n267\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:36.810\nThe big difference is if you do a PNG 24,\nPNG 24 is like the best of both worlds.\n\n268\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.390\nYou have the color support of a JPEG file,\nthe 16 million colors.\n\n269\n00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.750\nYou have the transparency\nsupport of a GIF.\n\n270\n00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.900\nAnd even more than than, you have\nalso an alpha transparency support.\n\n271\n00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.460\nAlpha means you could have\ntones of transparency.\n\n272\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.240\nBiggest thing,\nif you had something with a drop shadow.\n\n273\n00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.090\nA drop shadow kind of diffuses out\nof the level of see-throughness.\n\n274\n00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.960\nWell, that can be saved in a PNG 24, so\n\n275\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.810\nyou have a transparency,\nmultiple levels of transparency.\n\n276\n00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.040\nThat's huge, and\n\n277\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:13.170\nthat's why a lot of people in the web\nworld really like the PNG file format.\n\n278\n00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.210\nGonna just throw this out there.\n\n279\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.470\nThis is a little guy.\n\n280\n00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.130\nIt's not little, cuz it's actually\nkinda coming up in popularity.\n\n281\n00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:23.190\nThe scalable vector graphic is\na vector format, which is like, whoa,\n\n282\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.400\nwait, okay, vector?\n\n283\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.270\nBut images are raster.\n\n284\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:33.420\nYes, but this new file format is vector,\nbut as pictures.\n\n285\n00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.110\nIt's XML based, it's becoming more of\na standard now, because it used to not be.\n\n286\n00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.280\nAnd I guess it's advancing\nwhat you can do.\n\n287\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.950\nThere's animation, there's a lot of\nstuff that can be done with SVG files,\n\n288\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.494\nand that's where I do the,\nso go look it up.\n\n289\n00:14:48.494 --> 00:14:52.610\n[LAUGH] Because it's even too much for\nme, there's so\n\n290\n00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.430\nmany different levels, and\ndifferent types and stuff like that.\n\n291\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.710\nYou see this a lot with your\ncell phones and everything.\n\n292\n00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.120\nSo I know a lot of your\ngraphics are going that way.\n\n293\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.520\nLike our icons on our smart phones\nare supposedly .SVG graphics.\n\n294\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.900\nThat's why it's over on the web\nside even though it's vector and\n\n295\n00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.250\nwe're talking about raster file formats.\n\n296\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.720\nIt's okay.\n\n297\n00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.800\nGo consult the oracle, as we say.\n\n298\n00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.890\nGo look it up online.\n\n299\n00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.390\nAnd then just come on\nover to the print file.\n\n300\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.720\nI know I was talking a lot\nabout these file formats, and\n\n301\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.850\nif you're brand new to this you're like,\nman, you lost me on RGB and 72.\n\n302\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:34.850\nIt's okay, you will commit this to memory\nas you keep progressing as a designer.\n\n303\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.530\nIt will just become secondhand knowledge,\nor\n\n304\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.610\njust, you can just roll\nit right off your tongue.\n\n305\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:44.002\nSo don't be overwhelmed right now,\njust sit back and watch it again.\n\n306\n00:15:44.002 --> 00:15:44.974\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Pretty much,\n\n327\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.556\nyeah, that's exactly why I do it.\n\n328\n00:16:41.556 --> 00:16:46.240\n[LAUGH] So that's sometimes why you might\nwant to go ahead and use, not might,\n\n329\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.560\nalways, like the book that I design\nthat all of the images are TIFFs,\n\n330\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.940\nthey're actually even 600 PPI.\n\n331\n00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.550\nLike whoa, 600 that's even clearer.\n\n332\n00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.120\nNo, because it always down samples down\nto 300 when you get it on the press.\n\n333\n00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.604\nAgain, just go, okay sure.\n\n334\n00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:05.720\n[LAUGH] It's okay to go above,\nyou just don't wanna go below.\n\n335\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.640\nAnd I threw these over here because\na lot of times when I'm doing print file\n\n336\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.300\nformats, I'll throw in a PSD,\na Photoshop file into there.\n\n337\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.100\nLike if I'm working in InDesign,\nI'll just go ahead and\n\n338\n00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.370\nkeep the PSD with the layers, everything\nin there as its native file format.\n\n339\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:25.040\nPlace that into InDesign or Illustrator,\ncuz you can place PSDs in Illustrator, and\n\n340\n00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.950\nthe nice thing is that\nit has all the options.\n\n341\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.210\nI can go to that edit original and it's\njust gonna open right up in Photoshop,\n\n342\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.395\nI do all the stuff, I keep all the layers,\nSave it, go back and it's perfect.\n\n343\n00:17:35.395 --> 00:17:38.905\nSo that integration of keeping\nthings in the native file format,\n\n344\n00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:40.125\nthat's why kinda throw down here,\n\n345\n00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:43.995\nworking with images within Adobe\nproducts keep a native format.\n\n346\n00:17:43.995 --> 00:17:45.725\nI like to keep that in there.\n\n347\n00:17:45.725 --> 00:17:49.765\nPlacing AI files in InDesign,\n\n348\n00:17:49.765 --> 00:17:53.495\nthat kinda gives you an extra\nlevel of things to work with.\n\n349\n00:17:53.495 --> 00:17:55.480\nSo that's why I threw it over here.\n\n350\n00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.420\nEPS, Encapsulated Postscript File\nthat is another one.\n\n351\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:04.140\nIt is a vector file format and so\na lot of times you want to go ahead and\n\n352\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.950\nsend that as your logo,\nespecially with t-shirts.\n\n353\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.100\n&gt;&gt; I was just about to say that,\nI was like I can contribute to this one.\n\n354\n00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.900\nWhen you design a t-shirt that's\nwhat they are gonna ask for.\n\n355\n00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.900\nFor but a lot of times often you'll\nneed it for other things too.\n\n356\n00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's what they\nalways want because it's more,\n\n357\n00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.890\nit's AI, Illustrator that's going\nto need Illustrator to open it.\n\n358\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:30.190\nEPS is like a generic,\nneutral file format that is rastered,\n\n359\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.882\nnope, sorry,\nvector based that they can use.\n\n360\n00:18:32.882 --> 00:18:34.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it usually equates to whatever type\n\n361\n00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.280\nof machinery and\nthings that they're going to use that way.\n\n362\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI think even if you're on a Mac too,\n\n363\n00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.810\nthat'll open up just in your preview.\n\n364\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.442\nWhereas, if I try and open up an EPS file,\n\n365\n00:18:42.442 --> 00:18:45.382\nsometimes I find that to be a little\nbit frustrating cuz I'm not like, no,\n\n366\n00:18:45.382 --> 00:18:48.393\nI don't want it in preview, I want it\nto go ahead and open up in Illustrator.\n\n367\n00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:54.019\nSo it kind of depends if you are on a Mac\nversus a PC how that's kinda open up.\n\n368\n00:18:54.019 --> 00:18:58.810\n&gt;&gt; The whole Mac preview thing, if you\ndon't have, it opens up PDFs in preview.\n\n369\n00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.960\nAnd I have to tell people like no,\n\n370\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.010\ndon't let it open up in it's\nnative association or file type.\n\n371\n00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.510\nGo ahead and right click on that and\n\n372\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.440\nopen it up with Adobe Reader because\nI want them to fill out forms or\n\n373\n00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.960\nsomething like that, and\nthey're like I don't have reader.\n\n374\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.100\nWell it's free go download it.\n\n375\n00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.580\nSo that's what we got and\nof course the PDF.\n\n376\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.810\nThat's what I usually send all of my\n\n377\n00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:24.838\nprint ready files to my commercial\nprinter, I send it to them in a PDF.\n\n378\n00:19:24.838 --> 00:19:28.820\nBut just saving something as a PDF doesn't\nautomatically make it print worthy,\n\n379\n00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.350\nyou have to start with a base.\n\n380\n00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:36.740\nIf I have a 72 PPI,\nRGB image in an illustrator file and\n\n381\n00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.220\nI save it as a PDF and\nI even do the high print export options,\n\n382\n00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.450\nthey're still gonna say this is\nthe wrong resolution this isn't right.\n\n383\n00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.760\nBut I saved as a PDF,\nas a higher print thingy in the presets.\n\n384\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.770\nNo it goes back to the core,\nthe base information,\n\n385\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:59.250\nif that image is not print ready,\ndoesn't matter what the PDF does.\n\n386\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.955\nSo I think few do I have anything else.\n\n387\n00:20:02.955 --> 00:20:04.840\nNope, bunch of white space, so\n\n388\n00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.090\nthat concludes this particular file and\nIllustrator,\n\n389\n00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:14.430\ngiving you all the base information\nof the file formats resolution.\n\n390\n00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.500\nAgain I threw out a lot of theory,\nif you want to say, to you, and\n\n391\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.940\nit will take some time to absorb.\n\n392\n00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.820\nTake little chunks take a little bit,\nit will take practice,\n\n393\n00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.150\nyou'll still mess it up as you go.\n\n394\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.145\nYou'll send files to the printer wrong,\nI still do it sometimes.\n\n395\n00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's even worse and\n\n396\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.640\nit's at the print shop\nmy husband works at.\n\n397\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.990\nI'm so sorry I'm so\nashamed, so embarrassed.\n\n398\n00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.610\n&gt;&gt; No honestly it really\ndoes take a long time.\n\n399\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.210\nIt's It's complicated kind\nof going through this stuff.\n\n400\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.140\nYou're seeing numbers and all these things\nthat you never really thought that you\n\n401\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.460\nwere gonna have to deal with, maybe,\nwhen you opened up Illustrator.\n\n402\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.322\nAnd it does make a tremendous\ndifference in your file size, so\n\n403\n00:20:51.322 --> 00:20:53.420\nI've been working with this for\na long time.\n\n404\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.170\nAnd there's a reason why I\npitched this one to Vonne and\n\n405\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.760\nsaid, you can handle that.\n\n406\n00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.790\nBecause it's just so\n\n407\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.190\ncomplicated, I really wanted to make\nsure that it was explained well.\n\n408\n00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.860\nAnd I think you did a fantastic job.\n\n409\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.670\n&gt;&gt; Why thank you so much.\n\n410\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.870\n&gt;&gt; So thank you so much.\n\n411\n00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.280\nThank you for wrapping up the file\ntypes and the resolution and\n\n412\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.530\nkinda going through all that with us.\n\n413\n00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.970\nBut I think with that, we will wrap it up.\n\n414\n00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.040\nSo, signing off for CreativeProTV,\nI've been your host, Emily Ramsey.\n\n415\n00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.014\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n416\n00:21:18.014 --> 00:21:20.121\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n417\n00:21:20.121 --> 00:21:20.621\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So clever, navigate\nthrough these waters, that was cute.\n\n8\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.470\nI like it I like it.\n\n9\n00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.289\nSo yeah, we're gonna go ahead and\nactually look at Illustrator and\n\n10\n00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.370\nsee what is kinda going on with this.\n\n11\n00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.540\nSo what i wanna do,\nI wanna go ahead and just, straight up,\n\n12\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.370\nstart with opening up Illustrator and\nsee exactly what we're looking at here.\n\n13\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.790\nSo, everything that we have,\n\n14\n00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.160\nthis whole thing is known as\nour workspace in Illustrator.\n\n15\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.440\nThe whole gamut is known as our workspace.\n\n16\n00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.650\nNow, we're gonna have a couple different\nlittle pieces and parts to this.\n\n17\n00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.540\nThat if you're just kinda getting started,\nyou'd really be like why\n\n18\n00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.320\ndoes it matter if I know what these\nthings are called or what they do.\n\n19\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.980\nIt's going to make a tremendous difference\nin your work flow if you have somewhat of\n\n20\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.740\nan understanding of each of\nthese different pieces and\n\n21\n00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.820\nwhat you can do with them.\n\n22\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.485\nSo what we're looking at here again\nthis entire here thing is known as our\n\n23\n00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:17.320\nworkspace.\n\n24\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.600\nThis top section here, this I feel\nlike I have many different names for.\n\n25\n00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.290\nI think technically it's\nreferred to as your options bar.\n\n26\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.130\nI usually call it your control panel or\nyour control bar.\n\n27\n00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.150\n&gt;&gt; From everything I've ever done,\nand this is going way back in\n\n28\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.930\nreally old earlier versions of\nIllustrator, it was the control panel.\n\n29\n00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthen we were talking about this.\n\n31\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.840\nIt was like I think they call it\nthe options bar now, I'm like, hm.\n\n32\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.490\nOkay, and we'll just call it the bar at\nthe top that gives you all the stuff.\n\n33\n00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n34\n00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:45.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As soon as I'm telling you that\n\n35\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.120\nyou need to learn all the proper names for\nthese,\n\n36\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.356\nI'm like let me start off with the one\nthat I [LAUGH] don't know very well.\n\n37\n00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:53.220\nBut that's basically what it does\nis it gives you the options.\n\n38\n00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.650\nIt's kind of the default, always there,\nit's gonna have different options,\n\n39\n00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.020\ndifferent controls that you\ncan use in Illustrator.\n\n40\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.420\n&gt;&gt; You might wanna throw out right here\nthat, the resolution of your monitor does\n\n41\n00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.165\nmake a difference on how much you see up\nin that control panel, I'll go with that.\n\n42\n00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:11.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because the lower the resolution,\n\n43\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.230\nthe less things you're gonna have because\neverything looks a little bigger.\n\n44\n00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.250\nThe higher the resolution everything\nlooks a little smaller, so\n\n45\n00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.060\nyou might have other options.\n\n46\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.430\nSo through the different episodes,\nif you're looking at yours and\n\n47\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.210\nlike, hey I've got a lot more\nthings on there, that's fine.\n\n48\n00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.760\nWe try to keep our resolution at\na place where it makes it easier for\n\n49\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.780\nyou to see on the screen.\n\n50\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nI think that's a great point too,\n\n51\n00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:34.280\ncuz that's definitely something that\nI've been noticing in this setup.\n\n52\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.720\nI'm like, wait a second,\nthat's normally there, and now it's not.\n\n53\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.311\nAnd it's because I've\nchanged my resolution so\n\n54\n00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:41.010\nthat you guys can see it on\nthe screen a little bit better.\n\n55\n00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.670\nNow, we have that top panel on\nthe right-hand side over here,\n\n56\n00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.570\nthese are known as our panels.\n\n57\n00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.620\nSo our panels, I want to say they're\nthe heart of Illustrator, but\n\n58\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.688\nI don't wanna take away\nfrom the stuff on the left.\n\n59\n00:02:52.688 --> 00:02:55.710\nYour panels are going to be something that\nyou're going to refer to all the time.\n\n60\n00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.460\nI'm going to try to introduce\nyou guys to how they work.\n\n61\n00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.240\nBut just know that as I'm working in\nIllustrator and as your kind of going\n\n62\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.970\nthrough these episodes you're going to see\nme interacting in my panels all the time.\n\n63\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.125\nSo if we don't touch\nthrough everything here,\n\n64\n00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.170\nyou're probably going to see me do\nsomething in one of those future episodes.\n\n65\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.910\nSo what I can do with my panels, you're\nseeing I'm looking at all of these icons.\n\n66\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.390\nThis has to do with\nthe workspace that I have set.\n\n67\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.820\nYou may have some different ones and\nwe'll kinda talk through that here.\n\n68\n00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.070\nBut something else that I\nwant to point out here,\n\n69\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.430\nif you're just looking at the icons and\n\n70\n00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.550\nyou're thinking, how am I ever gonna\nremember what each of those means?\n\n71\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.610\nSee how if I kinda hover along the side\nhere, I get two double-pointed arrows?\n\n72\n00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.850\nDon't hover right next\nto one of the icons, but\n\n73\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.000\nhover just kind of between them and\nI get those double-pointed arrows.\n\n74\n00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.620\nI can pull those out and you guys can\nactually start to see the names of those.\n\n75\n00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.030\nNow, just because I'm accustomed\nto working in Illustrator,\n\n76\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.890\nI tend to keep that kind of pushed off\nto the side, I'd rather have more space.\n\n77\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.570\nI don't know the names,\njust because I'm so familiar with it.\n\n78\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.200\nBut I would definitely say, when you're\nstarting out, try to make sure that you\n\n79\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.720\nhave those names there, just so that\ncan give you a little bit of a preview.\n\n80\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.980\nNow our panels essentially\nact like drawers.\n\n81\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.210\nSo it's kinda fun,\nyou go ahead and click on one.\n\n82\n00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.090\nIt's gonna go ahead and\npop out all of this other information.\n\n83\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.330\nIf I click over here it's all\ngonna look a little bit different.\n\n84\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.150\nAnd you can kinda keep going.\n\n85\n00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.160\nAnd then the other thing with these\ndrawers is that I can kinda pull one out.\n\n86\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.640\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ntake this swatches panel.\n\n87\n00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.440\nIf I just click right on this word,\nswatches, I'm not over here in my panels\n\n88\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.900\nover here, but I'm just looking\nspecifically at the swatches panel.\n\n89\n00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.150\nIf I wanna click hold and drag,\nand just kinda pull that out,\n\n90\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.300\nI can now separate the swatches\npanel from everything else.\n\n91\n00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.690\nNow if I wanna give myself\na little bit more space,\n\n92\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.575\nsee those two double-pointed arrows,\nwhat's now left in my symbols panel,\n\n93\n00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:41.880\ncuz those were all kinda grouped together,\nwe'll talk about it in a second.\n\n94\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.520\nMy symbols panel is now\nthe one that's left open.\n\n95\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.510\nIf I click on those two double pointed\narrows, that'll go ahead and tuck that in.\n\n96\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.600\nSo now I can move this\nswatches panel out and say,\n\n97\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.310\nokay maybe I want it to move over there.\n\n98\n00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.760\nI can also use the double-pointed\narrows at the bottom.\n\n99\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.570\nGo ahead and drag that out,\n\n100\n00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.430\nyou'll see you have some kind of hidden\ninformation there in your swatches panel.\n\n101\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.560\nNow say, I want to go ahead and\ntuck this back in.\n\n102\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.580\nI can go ahead and do that,\nI'm tired of having my swatches panel out.\n\n103\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.190\nSo I can go ahead and click,\nhold, and drag and drag that in.\n\n104\n00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.780\nNow you'll see,\n\n105\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.340\ndepending on where I'm hovering,\nit's giving me different options here.\n\n106\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.100\nSo I can kind of hover over here, and\nit's gonna link that back where it was.\n\n107\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.600\nNow you may notice,\nit's kind of hard to see on my screen,\n\n108\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.530\nyou may notice these kind of lines here.\n\n109\n00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.465\nIt's kind of like everything is\nin these chunks or these groups.\n\n110\n00:05:25.465 --> 00:05:28.857\nLike I see swatches, brushes,\nsymbols in one chunk,\n\n111\n00:05:28.857 --> 00:05:31.790\ncolor-color guide in another chunk.\n\n112\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.950\nI could move the swatches over\nto the color and color guide.\n\n113\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.750\nWhich, when we get into that,\nwill kinda make sense.\n\n114\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.070\nI can kind of put it in\nbetween those two sections,\n\n115\n00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.530\nsee how I'm getting that\nlittle line there right now?\n\n116\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.210\nAnd I can go ahead and\nput the swatches on it's own.\n\n117\n00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.775\nSo you can really organize these\nto your hearts content, as you go.\n\n118\n00:05:48.775 --> 00:05:52.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and, like you just said,\nit is up to you how and\n\n119\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.270\nwhere you want to put things and\nwhere you want to group them or\n\n120\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.520\nmake a single panel be in it's own group,\nit's totally up to you.\n\n121\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.365\nAnd I know that they used to,\nand they might still be able to,\n\n122\n00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:06.480\nif you kind of hover a little bit further\npast, you can almost make like a double\n\n123\n00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.980\npanel docking area, in the sense\nof where it's like you get the-\n\n124\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.010\n&gt;&gt; This little guy?\n\n125\n00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.750\n&gt;&gt; That little guy, yeah.\n\n126\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.530\n&gt;&gt; Is that what you're talking about?\n\n127\n00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or where you're dragging.\n\n128\n00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.320\nIf you drag off to the side,\nand then you move that over.\n\n129\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if I kinda drag it here.\n\n130\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.070\n&gt;&gt; That one.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n131\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.000\n&gt;&gt; The vertical blue line.\n\n132\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.748\n&gt;&gt; I got you now, all right.\n\n133\n00:06:24.748 --> 00:06:25.417\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n134\n00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've had people do that, and\n\n135\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.550\nbe like I don't know what I did.\n\n136\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.380\nBecause you can have double\ncolumns if you want of say,\n\n137\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.000\nof panels where you can kind\nof organize it that way.\n\n138\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.930\nBecause, there's actually a lot of\npanels in Illustrator as opposed\n\n139\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.200\nto other programs that are on by\ndefault You can customize it and\n\n140\n00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.800\ntake any of the ones that you don't want\nout and close them or make them go away.\n\n141\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.500\nBut just to let you know,\n\n142\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.995\nthat there is a second docking station\nin your panel stuff over there.\n\n143\n00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:57.691\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I had totally forgotten about that.\n\n144\n00:06:57.691 --> 00:06:58.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n145\n00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.690\nI'm glad you mentioned it, thank you.\n\n146\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.560\nSo yeah, I'm just kind of hovering here\nbetween, just kind of between spaces.\n\n147\n00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.381\nAnd you'll see I got that blue line that\nlets me know that I can go ahead and\n\n148\n00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:09.300\nadd that in there.\n\n149\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.040\nNah, I'm gonna tug it out,\ncuz I wanna keep it.\n\n150\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.700\nBut I'm going to go ahead and do this, and\n\n151\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.822\njust pull this out again\njust to show you one thing.\n\n152\n00:07:14.822 --> 00:07:16.520\nNow, Vonne kind of touched\non something here,\n\n153\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.540\nwhat if I want to get rid of a panel?\n\n154\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.170\nSo my swatches panel is pretty\nimportant in Illustrator, so\n\n155\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.350\nthis is realistically not\none I'm gonna get rid of.\n\n156\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.700\nBut when I get rid of it,\nI can show you how to add more.\n\n157\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.250\nSo let's say I go ahead and click on\nthis x icon in the top left-hand corner.\n\n158\n00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.170\nKinda like you're closing out\nsomething on your computer,\n\n159\n00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.910\njust hit the x to go ahead and say,\nokay, you know what, I don't want that.\n\n160\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.033\nWe mentioned there are a lot of\ndifferent panels in illustrator,\n\n161\n00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:43.411\nI'm tired of looking at it.\n\n162\n00:07:43.411 --> 00:07:47.354\nNow, what do I do when I actually\nneed to grab that back, or\n\n163\n00:07:47.354 --> 00:07:50.980\nI need a different panel\nthat's not available to me?\n\n164\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.142\nThat's all gonna be under your window\nmenu, so kind of Skip past this\n\n165\n00:07:56.142 --> 00:08:01.970\ninformation at the top, see where\nit says actions, through variables?\n\n166\n00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.030\nThose are gonna be all the panels that you\ncan add into your illustrator workspace.\n\n167\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.610\nSo when we say there's a lot,\nthis is what we mean.\n\n168\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.880\nYou might have been looking at me like,\n\n169\n00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.240\nthis doesn't seem like that many,\nit can get to be quite a bit.\n\n170\n00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.240\nSo, I can now go down here and\nadd swatches.\n\n171\n00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.806\nNote they're all in alphabetical order.\n\n172\n00:08:17.806 --> 00:08:20.820\nWe save actions, go down to brushes.\n\n173\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.040\nYada, yada, yada and\nthen you all go down to your swatches.\n\n174\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.030\nNow you will also notice that\nthere are a couple fly out menus.\n\n175\n00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.820\nThe tight menu is always\nthe one that gets me.\n\n176\n00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.970\nSo if you aren't seeing something,\n\n177\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.910\nmake sure that it's not\nhidden under a tight menu.\n\n178\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.969\nSo, we'll get to character and\nparagraph and all of that later, but\n\n179\n00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:38.294\nif you're seeing and you're like,\nokay she told me it's alphabetized,\n\n180\n00:08:38.294 --> 00:08:40.494\nI'm looking in the Cs,\nI don't see character.\n\n181\n00:08:40.494 --> 00:08:42.811\nJust make sure that it's not\ntucked underneath something else.\n\n182\n00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:45.149\nSo, that's definitely one\nthat you want to be aware of.\n\n183\n00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:47.281\nI'm going to go ahead and\ngrab that swatches panel,\n\n184\n00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:49.763\nyou see by default it's just\ngoing to open up off to the side.\n\n185\n00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:54.246\nAnd then it's up to me to drag, and\ndrop, and rearrange this however I want.\n\n186\n00:08:54.246 --> 00:08:57.140\nNow, let's say I go ahead and\nadd a bunch of panels.\n\n187\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.790\nWell, I already had the brushes panel.\n\n188\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.850\nOf course I picked one that I already had.\n\n189\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.963\nBut, I'll go ahead and add the gradient.\n\n190\n00:09:03.963 --> 00:09:04.525\nI already had the gradient [LAUGH].\n\n191\n00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:05.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How about attributes?\n\n192\n00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:08.057\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay, transparency flattener,\n\n193\n00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:10.190\nthe other flattener preview.\n\n194\n00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.140\n&gt;&gt; I know those aren't in there.\n\n195\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.190\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, I just automatically\nwant to grab a bunch of things.\n\n196\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n197\n00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.812\n&gt;&gt; It's my instinct [LAUGH].\n\n198\n00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:21.186\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n199\n00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.671\nso I'm going to go to window.\n\n200\n00:09:22.671 --> 00:09:24.784\nI'll grab, there are the align panels.\n\n201\n00:09:24.784 --> 00:09:25.748\n&gt;&gt; Attributes.\n\n202\n00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:26.459\n&gt;&gt; Attributes.\n\n203\n00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:29.680\n&gt;&gt; Well see, I'm grabbing ones\nthat I like to use a lot.\n\n204\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.939\nAnd I think that's a lot of what it is.\n\n205\n00:09:30.939 --> 00:09:31.557\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n206\n00:09:31.557 --> 00:09:32.512\nThey're already there.\n\n207\n00:09:32.512 --> 00:09:34.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're already there.\n\n208\n00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.490\nBack to the example.\n\n209\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.290\nLet's say that I have\ngrabbed a bunch of these or\n\n210\n00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.810\nmaybe I have even just moved\na bunch of them around.\n\n211\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.470\nI've rearranged things and\n\n212\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.150\nmy work space is starting to\nget a little bit messy here.\n\n213\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.570\nWhat can I do to fix this, right?\n\n214\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:52.830\nAll of these things can actually\nbe saved or reset or recalibrated.\n\n215\n00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.450\nThrough the workspace that we are using.\n\n216\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.750\nSo, I said when we opened it up,\n\n217\n00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.280\nmy panels might look a little\nbit different than yours.\n\n218\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.880\nAnd that's because I'm\nusing a certain workspace.\n\n219\n00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.300\nSo, if you look up here in the top right\nhand corner where it says Essentials.\n\n220\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.550\nThat's because I'm using\nthe Essentials workspace.\n\n221\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.000\nYou might be using something else.\n\n222\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.686\nSo, just look to where\nmine says Essentials.\n\n223\n00:10:14.686 --> 00:10:17.074\nAnd if it says any of these\nother ones underneath it,\n\n224\n00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:20.292\nthat's probably just because you're\nusing a different workspace.\n\n225\n00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:22.150\nSo if I go to the layout workspace,\n\n226\n00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.133\nyou're gonna see that that's going to\nthen give me all of those options.\n\n227\n00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:28.481\nThe layout workspace\nhas got a lot going on.\n\n228\n00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:31.750\nBut I can click here,\nI can go to typography.\n\n229\n00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.580\nYou see you have a web workspace.\n\n230\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.240\nYou see all of these various different\noptions, and then if I go back to\n\n231\n00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.990\nEssentials, you're gonna be like, but\nit still looks all crazy, I wanna fix it.\n\n232\n00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.667\nHere's what you gonna do.\n\n233\n00:10:43.667 --> 00:10:47.126\nI'm gonna click on this, and\nthen I'm gonna choose reset essentials.\n\n234\n00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:50.870\nNow, if you like it crazy like this,\nand you wanna go ahead and\n\n235\n00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.531\nsave it, a new workspace.\n\n236\n00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:56.748\nYou can go ahead and save a workspace,\ngo ahead and give it title and\n\n237\n00:10:56.748 --> 00:11:00.304\nif these are things you want\nto use every time, you can.\n\n238\n00:11:00.304 --> 00:11:01.822\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n239\n00:11:01.822 --> 00:11:05.210\nhit cancel because my brain is\nalready all over the place.\n\n240\n00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.370\nI don't need to go ahead and\nsave all these panels here.\n\n241\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.033\nBut I may go back and go ahead and\nreset essentials and say, okay,\n\n242\n00:11:12.033 --> 00:11:14.978\nI wanna go ahead and\nreset that back to the other way.\n\n243\n00:11:14.978 --> 00:11:20.698\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I love doing workspaces even\nsometimes for each project that I'm doing.\n\n244\n00:11:20.698 --> 00:11:24.581\nSo,I have a certain set of panels for\none project, a certain set of panels for\n\n245\n00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:25.135\nanother.\n\n246\n00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:28.394\nAnd I saw one that you have for class,\nlike when you teach your class.\n\n247\n00:11:28.394 --> 00:11:29.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n248\n00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.860\n&gt;&gt; You have a specific way that\nyou want everything to look.\n\n249\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.830\nAnd that's where the other ones\nare the predetermined ones from Adobe,\n\n250\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.060\nit came with the program.\n\n251\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.710\nAnd why did it determine that the,\nlayout workspace had those panels?\n\n252\n00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.330\nThat's what they just decided to do.\n\n253\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.470\nAnd it's up to you and you can take those\nas starting point modify, like she said,\n\n254\n00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.920\ncreate your own, reset.\n\n255\n00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.485\nIt's nice that they give you this\nflexibility of how you wanna change,\n\n256\n00:11:56.485 --> 00:11:58.597\nit's almost like your desk,\n\n257\n00:11:58.597 --> 00:12:02.400\nwhere you're sitting at, like where you're\ngoing to, well work, your workspace.\n\n258\n00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.088\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes exactly I love it.\n\n259\n00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:06.001\nYeah and she pointed out here,\n\n260\n00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:09.835\nif you look up here,\nI have one saved in the past called class.\n\n261\n00:12:09.835 --> 00:12:13.274\nWhich was a really just an example I used\none time when I was teaching a class\n\n262\n00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:14.170\nthat I saved.\n\n263\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.320\nBut I could go ahead and use these.\n\n264\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.962\nI tend to use the Essentials\nas my starting point.\n\n265\n00:12:17.962 --> 00:12:20.560\nEssentials, it's kind of\nabout the core group.\n\n266\n00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.632\nAnd then I just go from there.\n\n267\n00:12:21.632 --> 00:12:24.905\nNow, one last thing I wanted\nto mention with our Panels.\n\n268\n00:12:24.905 --> 00:12:28.463\nI mentioned this when I was trying to\nfigure out where Vonne was going with that\n\n269\n00:12:28.463 --> 00:12:29.679\nsecond docking station.\n\n270\n00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:32.962\nYou see these little double pointed\narrows just above my panels?\n\n271\n00:12:32.962 --> 00:12:35.694\nIn my case I have\nthe color panel at the top.\n\n272\n00:12:35.694 --> 00:12:39.002\nSo I see it just above the color palette,\ndouble pointed arrow.\n\n273\n00:12:39.002 --> 00:12:41.549\nSee how it says Expand Panels?\n\n274\n00:12:41.549 --> 00:12:42.526\nThat's another option that you have.\n\n275\n00:12:42.526 --> 00:12:46.086\nYou may have even noticed as we've\nfiltered through some of the workspaces,\n\n276\n00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:49.935\nthat some of these had a similar effect,\nor they look totally different from this.\n\n277\n00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.905\nSo if I click on those\ndouble pointed arrows,\n\n278\n00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:56.005\nyou see that it's really gonna expand\nout all of those panels that I had.\n\n279\n00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:59.760\nNow, I don't personally\nlike working this way.\n\n280\n00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.775\nWe kind of laughed before,\nI was like make it stop, make it stop.\n\n281\n00:13:02.775 --> 00:13:04.410\nBecause it's just not my thing, but.\n\n282\n00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:04.935\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n283\n00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:07.700\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And then I popped off and\nwas like yeah, I always expand that.\n\n284\n00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.658\nAnd you're like no, no, no, don't do that.\n\n285\n00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:10.166\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n286\n00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:14.010\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I think this is also\nhow it used to be a long time ago.\n\n287\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.550\nIt was never collapsed and especially if\nI've been working in Photoshop a lot.\n\n288\n00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.427\nI'm always just used\nto seeing it this way.\n\n289\n00:13:21.427 --> 00:13:23.049\nAnd then I collapse and expand them.\n\n290\n00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:25.069\nI think the clicking on the tabs?\n\n291\n00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:27.635\nDouble clicking on each tab will\ngo ahead and collapse them?\n\n292\n00:13:27.635 --> 00:13:29.020\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; In this mode, and so\n\n293\n00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.320\nI'll just use it that way.\n\n294\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.952\nBut to each its own, you do it\nhowever you feel is necessary and\n\n295\n00:13:35.952 --> 00:13:38.100\nmakes you comfortable for your workspace.\n\n296\n00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.910\nSo, yeah we had that debate of expand or\n\n297\n00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.510\nto not expand, and\nwe don't see eye to eye.\n\n298\n00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that's okay [LAUGH].\n\n299\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.780\n&gt;&gt; That does not make\nme comfortable [LAUGH].\n\n300\n00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:52.150\nYeah, this is how I like to work, but this\nis the beautiful thing about this program\n\n301\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.750\nis that you can customize\nit to your own way.\n\n302\n00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.350\nYou think about it, you know your work\nspace, to use that example again.\n\n303\n00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.600\nMy desk may look totally different\nfrom somebody else's desk.\n\n304\n00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.070\nI'm somebody who likes everything tidy.\n\n305\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.490\nA lot of people like\neverything to be really messy.\n\n306\n00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.200\nIt just depends on your\nown personal preferences.\n\n307\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.310\nSo definitely work with that,\nas you will, and\n\n308\n00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.890\nyou'll probably find your own\nstyle as you get into Illustrator.\n\n309\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.750\nNow, that's all on our right hand side.\n\n310\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.950\nThose again what are known as our Panels.\n\n311\n00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.615\nOn the left-hand side, over here\nwe have what's known as our tools.\n\n312\n00:14:20.615 --> 00:14:25.726\nNow, our tools aren't quite as\ncustomizable as our panels are.\n\n313\n00:14:25.726 --> 00:14:28.370\nBut there are a couple of\ndifferent things you can do.\n\n314\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.330\nYou have that double-pointed arrow again,\nso mine right here,\n\n315\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.740\nyou see it's kind of set in that two rows.\n\n316\n00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.740\nI can click on that double-pointed arrow\njust above where I have that black arrow.\n\n317\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.050\nAnd I can click on that.\n\n318\n00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.110\nAnd it will take it from one row, two.\n\n319\n00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.990\nI personally like mine to be in two.\n\n320\n00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.550\nI'm realizing I'm very particular about\nmy workspace, as I go through this.\n\n321\n00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.880\nIt has to be in two.\n\n322\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.345\nBut then what you'll see here, as you go\ndown, these are all gonna be things that.\n\n323\n00:14:54.345 --> 00:14:57.963\nWe're not really gonna change, were not\nnecessarily really gonna add new tools.\n\n324\n00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:00.010\nI'm not gonna move them around.\n\n325\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.170\nThe only two things that I would point\nout with this.one, the black arrow.\n\n326\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.910\nYou'll see I had that\nselection tool chosen.\n\n327\n00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.062\nI'm using that one in\nthe top left hand corner.\n\n328\n00:15:09.062 --> 00:15:10.625\nThat's always gonna be our default.\n\n329\n00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:12.402\nSo, we always say back to black.\n\n330\n00:15:12.402 --> 00:15:15.846\nAnd so, we wanna stick with that black\narrow tool that I would recommend you use.\n\n331\n00:15:15.846 --> 00:15:18.390\nNow, the other thing\nthat I wanted to mention.\n\n332\n00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.512\nAnd some of these, for me, might look\na little bit different from LIU.\n\n333\n00:15:21.512 --> 00:15:24.900\nIf I hover down here,\nsee how mine says Ellipse Tool?\n\n334\n00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.950\nIf you're just opening up Illustrator for\nthe first time,\n\n335\n00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.910\nyours probably says Rectangle Tool.\n\n336\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.170\nWhich brings us to this\nconcept of hidden tools.\n\n337\n00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.640\nAny time you see a little flag in\nthe bottom right hand corner of a tool.\n\n338\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.940\nSo you see kind of a white triangle.\n\n339\n00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:38.670\nIf I click and\n\n340\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.340\nhold on that, see how that brings up\nall these other different options.\n\n341\n00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.010\nSo, Rectangle Tool,\nRounded Rectangle Tool, Polygon, Star.\n\n342\n00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.880\nI have all those different\noptions available to me.\n\n343\n00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.440\nNow, we're gonna get into our tools later.\n\n344\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.090\nDon't worry, we're gonna be.\n\n345\n00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.174\nHanging out a lot there.\n\n346\n00:15:52.174 --> 00:15:57.256\nSo, we'll kind of get into what that\nrectangle and all those things create.\n\n347\n00:15:57.256 --> 00:16:00.359\nSo, a couple of other just\nlittle fun facts here.\n\n348\n00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:05.270\nOne, is just a troubleshooting thing,\nthe tab key on your keyboard.\n\n349\n00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.010\nThis gets people all the time.\n\n350\n00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.850\nIf I have nothing selected, say I'm not\ntyping necessarily, I'm just sitting here.\n\n351\n00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.040\nAnd I go ahead and\nhit the tab key on my keyboard.\n\n352\n00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.440\nWhen I hit the tab key on my keyboard,\n\n353\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.648\nit's basically going to make all\nthat we just talked about go away.\n\n354\n00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.050\nAnd so you'll be going back here and\n\n355\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.670\nyou'll be like,\nno I need to change my workspace.\n\n356\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.070\nI need to do this or that, it kinda\njust sets you in this preview mode,\n\n357\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:28.900\nif you will.\n\n358\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.508\nGo ahead and hit the Tab key again on\nyour keyboard, and that will go ahead and\n\n359\n00:16:33.508 --> 00:16:35.312\nget everything back for you.\n\n360\n00:16:35.312 --> 00:16:38.103\nSo that's definitely\nsomething to be aware of.\n\n361\n00:16:38.103 --> 00:16:43.025\nNow, the other thing I wanted to mention,\nif you are on a MAC like I am,\n\n362\n00:16:43.025 --> 00:16:48.300\nthen something that you wanna pay\nattention to is this application frame.\n\n363\n00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.659\nSo, you'll see all of my stuff\nis kind of docked in together.\n\n364\n00:16:52.659 --> 00:16:54.918\nIt's kind of taking up an entire space.\n\n365\n00:16:54.918 --> 00:16:58.156\nLike if I move this,\nit's all tied together, right?\n\n366\n00:16:58.156 --> 00:17:03.146\nIf I go to my Window menu, and\nI choose this option application for no,\n\n367\n00:17:03.146 --> 00:17:06.034\nagain, I believe this is MAC specific.\n\n368\n00:17:06.034 --> 00:17:09.240\nI don't think this is anything\nyou pc-user have to worry about.\n\n369\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.204\nThat would go ahead and\neither take me back to I think,\n\n370\n00:17:13.204 --> 00:17:19.296\nhow most programs operate on a MAC, where\nI have these all untied from each other.\n\n371\n00:17:19.296 --> 00:17:23.766\nOr what I can do, and I kinda tucked\nthose all in unintentionally.\n\n372\n00:17:23.766 --> 00:17:28.135\nWhat I can do is just go back to my Window\nmenu, choose Application Frame, and\n\n373\n00:17:28.135 --> 00:17:30.298\nit's gonna lock it all back in there.\n\n374\n00:17:30.298 --> 00:17:33.233\nSo, that's definitely from\nmy own personal preference.\n\n375\n00:17:33.233 --> 00:17:37.201\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that the see-through-ness\nas I call it, of the whole program.\n\n376\n00:17:37.201 --> 00:17:39.772\nThere's no, there's no back to it.\n\n377\n00:17:39.772 --> 00:17:44.145\nAnd this is one specifically with\nillustrator that it does that,\n\n378\n00:17:44.145 --> 00:17:45.983\nfor some reason, on a MAC.\n\n379\n00:17:45.983 --> 00:17:47.508\nSo just make sure you always\ndo an application frame.\n\n380\n00:17:47.508 --> 00:17:49.012\nIt's a little weird.\n\n381\n00:17:49.012 --> 00:17:52.111\nAnd I, honestly, I can't remember\nif its on by default or not.\n\n382\n00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:53.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n383\n00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:56.775\nJust letting you know that it's there,\ncuz it's been an area of contention for\n\n384\n00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:57.724\nsome people.\n\n385\n00:17:57.724 --> 00:17:58.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n386\n00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.677\nI think it's just, again,\nit's your own personal preference.\n\n387\n00:18:00.677 --> 00:18:03.204\nIt's kinda the same way\nthat looks very similar to\n\n388\n00:18:03.204 --> 00:18:05.077\nthe way other programs on a MAC work.\n\n389\n00:18:05.077 --> 00:18:07.954\nIf I think about Microsoft Word, or\nsomething like that, it looks like that.\n\n390\n00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:10.358\nBut, I just can't handle\nit with the illustrator, so\n\n391\n00:18:10.358 --> 00:18:11.624\nI've got to work with this.\n\n392\n00:18:11.624 --> 00:18:14.805\nNow, there's one other thing that I want\nto mention here in talking about zooming.\n\n393\n00:18:14.805 --> 00:18:16.802\nSo I'm gonna look at this here.\n\n394\n00:18:16.802 --> 00:18:18.956\nNow, you'll see one\nthing else to point out,\n\n395\n00:18:18.956 --> 00:18:21.065\nis that I have multiple\nfiles open right now.\n\n396\n00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:23.720\nSo you can kind of see what that's\ngoing to start to look like,\n\n397\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.162\nwhen you open up multiple files.\n\n398\n00:18:25.162 --> 00:18:28.075\nWe'll certainly discuss that\nin our file new episode.\n\n399\n00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:32.137\nBut I'm gonna jump over to this move and\nzoom, just so we can talk\n\n400\n00:18:32.137 --> 00:18:37.120\nabout some of our Zooming methods and\nkinda how to move around in Illustrator.\n\n401\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.590\nSo, one thing that we wanna talk about,\n\n402\n00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:43.090\nas always using our\nkeyboard shortcuts to zoom.\n\n403\n00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.501\nSo we're big fans of keyboard\nshortcuts right here.\n\n404\n00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:48.890\nI have a lot of this written out,\nwe can certainly make this available in\n\n405\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.576\nthe exercise files if you wanna kind of\nread through them and and look at that.\n\n406\n00:18:52.576 --> 00:18:54.932\nBut I'm just gonna point out\na couple of my favorites.\n\n407\n00:18:54.932 --> 00:18:59.098\nIf I wanna go ahead and zoom in,\nI am gonna to use a command or\n\n408\n00:18:59.098 --> 00:19:00.554\ncontrol plus sign.\n\n409\n00:19:00.554 --> 00:19:03.753\nSo a command on a MAC and control on a PC.\n\n410\n00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:05.547\nYou'll probably hear me say that a lot.\n\n411\n00:19:05.547 --> 00:19:07.343\nCommand on a MAC, control on a PC.\n\n412\n00:19:07.343 --> 00:19:10.155\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit command or control plus sign, and\n\n413\n00:19:10.155 --> 00:19:11.469\nthat's gonna zoom in for me.\n\n414\n00:19:11.469 --> 00:19:15.724\nNow say I really want to get that yellow\ncircle that I had there at the bottom.\n\n415\n00:19:15.724 --> 00:19:17.674\nI'm gonna hold down my spacebar.\n\n416\n00:19:17.674 --> 00:19:21.509\nMy space bar is going to\ntoggle to my hand marquee.\n\n417\n00:19:21.509 --> 00:19:25.622\nI'm gonna go ahead and hold that down,\nand then now I can click, hold, and drag.\n\n418\n00:19:25.622 --> 00:19:30.280\nSee how that hand as I single click\nkinda grabs onto my art board?\n\n419\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.590\nAnd I can go ahead and Select that there.\n\n420\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.447\nSo I can toggle back and\nforth as I'm using that.\n\n421\n00:19:37.447 --> 00:19:38.862\nSo again, that is your spacebar.\n\n422\n00:19:38.862 --> 00:19:43.053\nIt's not command spacebar, it's not\nshift space bar, it's just spacebar.\n\n423\n00:19:43.053 --> 00:19:45.030\nNow say I wanna go ahead and\nget out of this.\n\n424\n00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.265\nI have two different\noptions that I can choose.\n\n425\n00:19:47.265 --> 00:19:51.285\nI can do command or Ctrl minus sign,\nor just the hyphen, I guess,\n\n426\n00:19:51.285 --> 00:19:53.325\nis what it is on your keyboard.\n\n427\n00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:54.845\nAnd to get out of this,\n\n428\n00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:59.460\nbut say, it's like I go too far or\nI go too far in, or whatever.\n\n429\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.696\nWhat do I do if I just want to\nkinda get back to a neutral?\n\n430\n00:20:02.696 --> 00:20:06.935\nThe keyboard shortcuts should just\nfit in window or fit in art board,\n\n431\n00:20:06.935 --> 00:20:11.628\nis technically what we're working with\nhere, is command or control zero.\n\n432\n00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:15.467\nSo that's another one, again, that you'll\nwant to go ahead and pay attention to.\n\n433\n00:20:15.467 --> 00:20:19.745\nNow there are a couple other ones you can\nuse, another one that I use that's pretty\n\n434\n00:20:19.745 --> 00:20:22.171\npopular is this spacebar command or\ncontrol.\n\n435\n00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:26.069\nNote how this one,\ntypically with everything in Illustrator,\n\n436\n00:20:26.069 --> 00:20:30.917\nI always say command or control first,\nand then I say something like spacebar.\n\n437\n00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:33.582\nThis one's kind of weird, again,\nthis is kind of max Pacific.\n\n438\n00:20:33.582 --> 00:20:37.122\nIf you were on a MAC and you try and\nuse the keyboard shortcut,\n\n439\n00:20:37.122 --> 00:20:40.387\nI guess if I do it the opposite way,\ncommand or control,\n\n440\n00:20:40.387 --> 00:20:43.670\nand then space bar,\nit pulls up your spotlight search.\n\n441\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.095\nThat's cool and\nthat's great if you're on a MAC but\n\n442\n00:20:46.095 --> 00:20:49.585\nnot gonna be very helpful if you're\ntrying to work on a specific document.\n\n443\n00:20:49.585 --> 00:20:52.313\nWhat I've found is that if you\nhold down your spacebar first.\n\n444\n00:20:52.313 --> 00:20:56.096\nAnd then command or control and\nthat will toggle to our zoom method.\n\n445\n00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:58.409\n[LAUGH].\n\n446\n00:20:58.409 --> 00:21:00.162\nAnd Vonne is just.\n\n447\n00:21:00.162 --> 00:21:03.233\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's good you didn't switch the camera\n\n448\n00:21:03.233 --> 00:21:04.690\nto me because I'm just like, ahh.\n\n449\n00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't tell if you were yawning,\n\n450\n00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.007\nI was like, am I that boring?\n\n451\n00:21:09.007 --> 00:21:14.094\n&gt;&gt; No because this is one of those\nwhere soon it becomes the teacher,\n\n452\n00:21:14.094 --> 00:21:16.784\nthe teacher becomes the student.\n\n453\n00:21:16.784 --> 00:21:19.901\nI always tell people to turn\nthat off in your presences.\n\n454\n00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:20.452\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n455\n00:21:20.452 --> 00:21:24.592\n&gt;&gt; In your MAC because you can go into\nyour keyboard and just uncheck that,\n\n456\n00:21:24.592 --> 00:21:26.119\ncuz I'm always using it.\n\n457\n00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:29.620\nCuz these short cuts that we're talking\nabout are across the board in all of your\n\n458\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.414\nAdobe products.\n\n459\n00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:34.315\nSo I was like well I'm gonna use it all\nthe time, so I'm gonna turn it off.\n\n460\n00:21:34.315 --> 00:21:39.148\nJust do the space bar and then that's\nwhat I like freaking out about over here.\n\n461\n00:21:39.148 --> 00:21:40.359\nJust turn it in reverse.\n\n462\n00:21:40.359 --> 00:21:42.524\nCause yeah I don't always\ndo commands space bar no.\n\n463\n00:21:42.524 --> 00:21:43.818\nSpace bar command.\n\n464\n00:21:43.818 --> 00:21:45.165\nI don't have to turn off\nmy search light [LAUGH].\n\n465\n00:21:45.165 --> 00:21:47.388\nCause I really like that.\n\n466\n00:21:47.388 --> 00:21:48.971\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n467\n00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:53.176\nIn fairness You can pretty much\nalways hit the control key first in\n\n468\n00:21:53.176 --> 00:21:56.705\nillustrator before you,\nI get where that comes from.\n\n469\n00:21:56.705 --> 00:21:59.340\nSo yes, you can hit spacebar and\nthen command.\n\n470\n00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.761\nNow if you're on a PC, probably not going\nto matter if you hit command or control,\n\n471\n00:22:02.761 --> 00:22:05.501\nbut, I guess if you're on a PC\nthen you would be hitting control.\n\n472\n00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:07.635\nSpacebar, order's not\ngonna make a difference.\n\n473\n00:22:07.635 --> 00:22:11.173\nIt's just us complicated MAC\nusers that have a problem.\n\n474\n00:22:11.173 --> 00:22:13.887\nSo you'll see that's gonna\ntoggle to my zoom tool.\n\n475\n00:22:13.887 --> 00:22:17.557\nSo what I can do, if there's something\nspecifically that I wanna zoom in on,\n\n476\n00:22:17.557 --> 00:22:20.944\nI can just kinda single-click on that,\nor I think you can even, yeah,\n\n477\n00:22:20.944 --> 00:22:22.822\nyou can kinda click, hold, and drag.\n\n478\n00:22:22.822 --> 00:22:26.680\nIf I'm just single-clicking on my mouse,\nholding and dragging,\n\n479\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.532\nthat will allow me to zoom\nin on a specific object.\n\n480\n00:22:29.532 --> 00:22:33.501\nSo if I really wanted to make sure I got\nin that circle as opposed to if I just go\n\n481\n00:22:33.501 --> 00:22:35.456\nback with a command or control zero.\n\n482\n00:22:35.456 --> 00:22:39.147\nThe plus sign, and\nthen kinda move around with the hand.\n\n483\n00:22:39.147 --> 00:22:42.329\nThat will get me into one specific spot.\n\n484\n00:22:42.329 --> 00:22:45.433\nSo definitely,\nthis is one of those things.\n\n485\n00:22:45.433 --> 00:22:49.507\nThis is part of the reason why we don't\nactually do anything in Illustrator in\n\n486\n00:22:49.507 --> 00:22:53.455\nthis first episode, because I feel like so\nmuch to it is just getting an idea\n\n487\n00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:56.858\nof where you're at and\nkind of what everything is looking like.\n\n488\n00:22:56.858 --> 00:22:59.429\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and my other favorite,\n\n489\n00:22:59.429 --> 00:23:04.138\nbecause we've talked about this as well,\nI can't design with a touchpad.\n\n490\n00:23:04.138 --> 00:23:07.444\nI have to have my mouse\nwhen I'm doing things.\n\n491\n00:23:07.444 --> 00:23:11.452\nAnd so the Alt or Option Scrolly-wheel up,\nScrolly-wheel down,\n\n492\n00:23:11.452 --> 00:23:15.127\nthat's another one of my favorites,\nkind of zoom in and out.\n\n493\n00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:19.815\nBecause I am using that, and\nit all depends on where your mouse is on\n\n494\n00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:23.106\nthe the document if you\nwanna stay right here.\n\n495\n00:23:23.106 --> 00:23:25.182\nAnd then you can scroll back.\n\n496\n00:23:25.182 --> 00:23:28.688\nI love doing that, and\nthat's kinda one of my favorites.\n\n497\n00:23:28.688 --> 00:23:30.220\nAnd all these toggles, yeah.\n\n498\n00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.274\nAnd over on that left hand side\nthat she had, like there are tools.\n\n499\n00:23:33.274 --> 00:23:34.508\nYou can go to the hand tool.\n\n500\n00:23:34.508 --> 00:23:35.347\nYou can go to the zoom tool.\n\n501\n00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:37.663\nBut that's just so, [LAUGH].\n\n502\n00:23:37.663 --> 00:23:38.965\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so why would I go ahead and\n\n503\n00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:42.086\ndo something the hard way when I could\njust do it with a keyboard shortcut?\n\n504\n00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:46.454\nSo, there are gonna be those\ntime in Illustrator when we say,\n\n505\n00:23:46.454 --> 00:23:50.486\nyes the tool exists or\nyes I could do this in my view menu but\n\n506\n00:23:50.486 --> 00:23:53.941\nwhy do that when you could\ndo it ten times easier?\n\n507\n00:23:53.941 --> 00:23:57.025\nSo I hope this has been\na good introduction for you,\n\n508\n00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:59.264\nin terms of working in Illustrator.\n\n509\n00:23:59.264 --> 00:24:02.110\nI know you're probably itching\nto go make something, but\n\n510\n00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.608\nI think it's really important\nto take this step and\n\n511\n00:24:04.608 --> 00:24:08.404\nreally learn what the workspace is all\nabout, and kind of start navigating.\n\n512\n00:24:08.404 --> 00:24:10.358\nAnd now, I promise the fun will begin.\n\n513\n00:24:10.358 --> 00:24:11.600\nAt least shortly.\n\n514\n00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.418\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The fun will begin.\n\n515\n00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:15.929\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have a few more episodes of us\n\n516\n00:24:15.929 --> 00:24:17.131\ngetting started.\n\n517\n00:24:17.131 --> 00:24:20.651\nIntroducing you into Illustrator but\nyou make a great point of it.\n\n518\n00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:23.146\nJust go ahead and practice those zooming.\n\n519\n00:24:23.146 --> 00:24:26.927\nIt seems kinda trivial right now and\nmake sure you get familiar with workspace.\n\n520\n00:24:26.927 --> 00:24:30.371\nLike knowing where the panel is and\nhow to tear it up and everything.\n\n521\n00:24:30.371 --> 00:24:34.066\nIt's like, we're all kind of guilty of,\nI am as well.\n\n522\n00:24:34.066 --> 00:24:36.402\nYou don't read the introduction\nchapter in the book.\n\n523\n00:24:36.402 --> 00:24:36.926\nYeah.\n\n524\n00:24:36.926 --> 00:24:38.664\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't read the directions.\n\n525\n00:24:38.664 --> 00:24:39.868\nYou kinda know all about that.\n\n526\n00:24:39.868 --> 00:24:41.810\nAs an instructor and a teacher, I do, too.\n\n527\n00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.334\nIt's like I read it right\nthere in the directions.\n\n528\n00:24:44.334 --> 00:24:46.893\nBut she just jumped right in and\ndid everything and didn't read it.\n\n529\n00:24:46.893 --> 00:24:48.559\nThat's okay.\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n530\n00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:49.452\nPractice it.\n\n531\n00:24:49.452 --> 00:24:51.006\nGet all those shortcuts down.\n\n532\n00:24:51.006 --> 00:24:52.070\nMemorize them.\n\n533\n00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.100\nIt won't take you long.\n\n534\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.333\nHonestly, as soon as you start doing more,\nyou will get it.\n\n535\n00:24:56.333 --> 00:24:58.208\nAll right, I think that was\na great introduction as well.\n\n536\n00:24:58.208 --> 00:25:00.602\nBut we are going to wrap this one up.\n\n537\n00:25:00.602 --> 00:25:03.360\nSigning off, for Creative Pro Tv,\nI have been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n538\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.202\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n539\n00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:05.548\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n540\n00:25:05.548 --> 00:25:10.336\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

New.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n7\n00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.417\n&gt;&gt; And here to help us is Ms Emily Ramsey,\n\n8\n00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:31.045\nso glad to have you back!\n\n9\n00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:35.795\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you, I feel like File &gt;\nNew is one of our more creative episode\n\n10\n00:00:35.795 --> 00:00:38.960\ntitles, that's basically what we're doing.\n\n11\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.710\nSo if we think about when we look at\nthe workspace and things like that.\n\n12\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.280\nI already had File &gt; Open, now you're\nprobably saying to me okay, yeah,\n\n13\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.430\nI know how to create a new file,\nlike File &gt; New, right?\n\n14\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.090\nAnd even if you don't, it's probably\nsomething that you're a little bit\n\n15\n00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.630\nfamiliar, you may be\nable to figure it out.\n\n16\n00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.740\nBut there is some of those little things\nabout it that I just wanted to point out.\n\n17\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.760\nSo let's go ahead and\nlook at my screen here and what I have,\n\n18\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.385\nI just pulled Illustrator up.\n\n19\n00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:09.250\nNow just by default in Illustrator\nyou'll see your recent files,\n\n20\n00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.244\nthis is something that you can change.\n\n21\n00:01:13.244 --> 00:01:16.800\nNow I'll get to that in a second,\nthe reason why I have this left up here\n\n22\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.080\ntypically when I'm teaching or\nshowing my screen.\n\n23\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.990\nI don't have any of my recent files\nbecause I don't want you to see my client\n\n24\n00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.230\nwork or anything like that.\n\n25\n00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.451\nBut these are all things that I've\ncreated for this particular show.\n\n26\n00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:31.459\nSo you're looking at some of the files\nthat you've probably seen or\n\n27\n00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.140\nwill see as we go through the episode.\n\n28\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.210\nWhat I wanna point out\nto you with this is one,\n\n29\n00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.725\nif I wanna go ahead and\njust jump back into one of these.\n\n30\n00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:41.705\nAll I have to do is just click on that but\n\n31\n00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:47.795\nthen also notice I have an AI intro dot\nAI but I also have an AI intro dot PDF.\n\n32\n00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.875\nSo saving as a PDF is\ngonna be something that\n\n33\n00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:54.855\nis gonna be really common in\nIllustrator more than likely.\n\n34\n00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:58.249\nAnd do note that although this doesn't\nhappen for everything, like if I'm saving\n\n35\n00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.926\nas an image or something like that\nit might be a little different.\n\n36\n00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:03.723\nMy PDF saves separately from my AI file,\nso\n\n37\n00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:08.010\nIllustrator is gonna treat them\nalmost as two different things.\n\n38\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.404\nSo I don't typically point this out\nright when I'm doing a File &gt; New but\n\n39\n00:02:11.404 --> 00:02:15.203\nbecause it's right here for you to look\nat I definitely did wanna point that out.\n\n40\n00:02:15.203 --> 00:02:19.047\nAnd we'll see what that looks like\nhere but I can go ahead here, this is\n\n41\n00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:23.170\nan option that I can change, so if you\nwant more you can go ahead and do that.\n\n42\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.910\nOr if you wanna get rid of that entirely,\n\n43\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.920\nsay you're in a weird situation like I am\nwhere you're showing people your screen\n\n44\n00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.790\nall the time,\nyou can go to Illustrator preferences.\n\n45\n00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.760\nAnd then I believe,\n\n46\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.725\nI always forget which one it is in,\nwe'll try User Interface, we'll go there,\n\n47\n00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:41.685\nnope I think it's under File &gt; Handling,\nyes, File &gt; Handling and Clip Art.\n\n48\n00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:45.465\nYou can change the number of recent\nfiles to display automatically,\n\n49\n00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:49.775\nit's gonna be set at 20, you can adjust\nit to your own personal preference.\n\n50\n00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:52.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the preferences, there's\na lot of things in the preferences.\n\n51\n00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:55.425\nWe might touch on those things here and\nthere throughout the episodes,\n\n52\n00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.630\nlike you can change\nsomething in Preferences.\n\n53\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.226\nAnd anyways, just make sure that you\ngo there, there are options there,\n\n54\n00:03:02.226 --> 00:03:04.671\nI think in a PC though,\nisn't it in the Edit menu?\n\n55\n00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:07.590\n&gt;&gt; It's the Edit menu I think,\nyou took the words right out of my mouth.\n\n56\n00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.249\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it gets me every time,\n\n57\n00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:10.192\nI am working on a Mac,\n\n58\n00:03:10.192 --> 00:03:13.200\nnow on my Mac it's just gonna be\nright under my Illustrator CC.\n\n59\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.471\nBut on a PC, I believe it's Edit and\nthen Preferences is down there but\n\n60\n00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:19.380\neither way just know that that's\nsomething you can change.\n\n61\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.806\nNow this episode is called File &gt; New,\nso let's go ahead and click on New,\n\n62\n00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:26.690\nI'm gonna go ahead and select that.\n\n63\n00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.030\nAnd what this is gonna do, it's gonna pull\nout this whole new document dialogue box.\n\n64\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.150\nIf you have been working with\nIllustrator for a while,\n\n65\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.210\nyou probably know that this has\nchanged a lot in recent versions.\n\n66\n00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.250\nSo I'm in Illustrator CC 2017.1 and\nthis is the most\n\n67\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.430\nup to date that we have as of right now,\nprobably will change again in the future.\n\n68\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.220\nBut what we're looking at here,\nthere's a ton of different things, so\n\n69\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.160\nI'm gonna start on the left-hand side.\n\n70\n00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.770\nWe have some recent sizes that I've used,\nso\n\n71\n00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.300\nyours might look a little bit different\nbut I have an 8.5x11 and I have a 4x6.\n\n72\n00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.595\nAgain, an 8.5x11, 5x7, so you can\nchoose through when you're going and\n\n73\n00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:04.100\nsay, okay,\nI just need to make a 4/6 again.\n\n74\n00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.560\nAnd you can go ahead and select that and\nit's gonna give you those dimensions.\n\n75\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.260\nYou also have Saved, an option for\nsaved, I don't have any saved and\n\n76\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.820\nalso an option for mobile.\n\n77\n00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.134\nThis is where it starts to get really\ninteresting cuz Illustrator has now not\n\n78\n00:04:16.134 --> 00:04:19.421\nonly added in these dimensions like,\nokay here's what an iPhone 6 plus.\n\n79\n00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:22.616\nThose are the dimensions that\nyou need to design for but also,\n\n80\n00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:27.240\nif I'm looking at this I have all these\ntemplates like mobile vector mockups.\n\n81\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.370\nYou used to have to go back in my day and\neither create that yourself or\n\n82\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.460\nfind it online, now it's all built\ninto illustrator so it's awesome.\n\n83\n00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.395\nYou have your Web Presets you can\nscroll through there, Web Large,\n\n84\n00:04:40.395 --> 00:04:45.035\nthat's gonna be your web site, we can take\nthat in and see what that looks like.\n\n85\n00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.250\nPrint Options, you're gonna have there and\nyou can filter through.\n\n86\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.220\nAnd if you're noticing over\non that right-hand side just\n\n87\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.090\nclicking through all these presets.\n\n88\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.660\nAll of those dimensions and everything,\n\n89\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.000\nthe units are all changing\nover there on the right.\n\n90\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.890\nBecause if you're working web,\nyou're gonna be working more with pixels.\n\n91\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.630\nIf you're in print, you might be working\nin pointer inches, so it changes depending\n\n92\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.730\non what medium that you're clicking on\nin all these defaults that are in there.\n\n93\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.670\nAnd yes, those templates,\nman, those are nice.\n\n94\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.682\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's pretty cool but\nI think Vonne,\n\n95\n00:05:17.682 --> 00:05:20.709\nyou've got us on a good start, let's go\nahead and go to this right-hand side.\n\n96\n00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.167\nSo we can look here,\nI can go ahead and give this a name,\n\n97\n00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:26.760\nnow this doesn't necessarily save my file\nwhen I wanna go to save my file later.\n\n98\n00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.286\nOr just filtering through in Illustrator,\nI can have a name already there for me, so\n\n99\n00:05:31.286 --> 00:05:32.830\nthat's nice.\n\n100\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.168\nI obviously don't necessarily\ntake the time to do that,\n\n101\n00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.200\nthis is why I am an untitled five,\nnot even untitled one, untitled five.\n\n102\n00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.942\nWhat I can do here,\nI can also change my width and\n\n103\n00:05:40.942 --> 00:05:44.350\nheight if I decide not to\nuse one of the presets.\n\n104\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.090\nAnd then right next to that I can change\nthose units that Vonne was mentioning,\n\n105\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.180\nI typically work in inches if\nI'm doing something for print.\n\n106\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.740\nFor print, you might also work in points\nespecially if you're in something I think\n\n107\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.320\nlike a newspaper, those use points a lot.\n\n108\n00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.410\nYou can also use pixels of\ncourse if you're on the web,\n\n109\n00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.420\nif you wanna be really wild and crazy you\ncan work in millimeters or centimeters.\n\n110\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.370\nOr whatever meters fits your need that\nday, and certainly that'll depend\n\n111\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.080\non the project that you're working on,\nso that's something to be aware of.\n\n112\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.180\nNow you can also change\nthe orientation of your page, so\n\n113\n00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.140\nif you want something that's\ngonna be landscape or portrait.\n\n114\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.330\nAnd basically all that does is just gonna\nflip your width and height, but yeah.\n\n115\n00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.870\nAnd then you see here, it says,\nArtboards and you're probably going,\n\n116\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.600\nwhat is an artboard?\n\n117\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.260\nTechnically, in Illustrator we\nwork off of Artboard, like pages.\n\n118\n00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.990\nSo if you think about Microsoft Word,\n\n119\n00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.930\neverything in Microsoft Word is created as\na page and they're pretty much all 8.5x11.\n\n120\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.090\nIn Illustrator, we'll talk about this in a\nseparate episode, talking about artboards.\n\n121\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.460\nBut what you're gonna see is artboards\nactually give us a lot of flexibility.\n\n122\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.330\nSo for now, even though this looks\nlike a page, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n123\n00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.593\nstick with the name Artboard cuz that\nis what we're technically working with.\n\n124\n00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:55.486\nBut here, you can go ahead and\nadd a couple, so if I wanna add two or\n\n125\n00:06:55.486 --> 00:06:58.290\nthree or whatever I wanna do,\nI can go ahead and add that there.\n\n126\n00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.890\n&gt;&gt; And just like you said, we're gonna\nhave a whole episode on artboards, and\n\n127\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.160\nthe nice thing is I forgot.\n\n128\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.310\nI was supposed to have three artboards\nin different dimensions and so\n\n129\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.520\non and so forth.\n\n130\n00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.420\nPersonally, I think it's easier to start\nwith one and then I use the Artboard tool\n\n131\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.490\nto make the others rather than\ndoing it in the File &gt; New.\n\n132\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.130\nBut you can designate them\nhere at the beginning but\n\n133\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.700\ndon't think that, I forgot,\nyou have to go back, no.\n\n134\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.163\nI personally would recommend\njust use the Artboard tool,\n\n135\n00:07:29.163 --> 00:07:30.828\nit makes it I think a little bit easier.\n\n136\n00:07:30.828 --> 00:07:34.714\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I tend to agree, it's very rare\nfor me to hit this button, let me tell you\n\n137\n00:07:34.714 --> 00:07:38.030\nthat, [LAUGH] I pretty much always\nstart with one, like Vonne said.\n\n138\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.500\nNow you'll also see this section\nat the bottom called Bleed,\n\n139\n00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.290\nbleed is gonna be something that is\nspecific to commercial printing.\n\n140\n00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.262\nHave you ever seen something printed and\nthe colors or\n\n141\n00:07:48.262 --> 00:07:51.773\nthe background image extended\nto the outside edge of the page.\n\n142\n00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:55.290\nThat actually requires a special\ntechnique known as bleed.\n\n143\n00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.180\nAnd I know Vonne knows a lot about\nprinting so she can jump in here but\n\n144\n00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.110\nessentially, the way that it works or\nthe way that I always compare it to.\n\n145\n00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.290\nIf I print something on\nmy home office printer,\n\n146\n00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.550\nyou know how I always get that\nwhite edge around my page?\n\n147\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.260\nCan't do anything about\na home office printer but\n\n148\n00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.770\nin commercial printing I can avoid\nhaving that white border around my page.\n\n149\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.175\nAnd that's gonna be\nthrough a use of a bleed.\n\n150\n00:08:15.175 --> 00:08:19.952\nAnd basically, what that says is,\nI need to have my page size 8.5x11 and\n\n151\n00:08:19.952 --> 00:08:23.420\nthen I need to print it\na certain dimension larger.\n\n152\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.870\nAnd then when I print it larger\nthe printer then can go ahead and\n\n153\n00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.340\ncut off that edge.\n\n154\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.440\nSo that it gives the appearance that\nsomething is extended to the outside\n\n155\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.180\nedge of the page.\n\n156\n00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.340\nEven though really, they just print it\non a bigger page and then cut it down.\n\n157\n00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.741\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you did a great job\nof explaining that [LAUGH].\n\n158\n00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:39.199\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You must have had a really good\n\n159\n00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:39.967\nteacher [LAUGH].\n\n160\n00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:43.889\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nI learned from the best clearly [LAUGH].\n\n161\n00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:47.671\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of times, commercial\nbleed settings is usually an 1/8 inch,\n\n162\n00:08:47.671 --> 00:08:50.481\ndepending on your printer\nyou might need more or less.\n\n163\n00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:54.785\nDepending on how they're going\nto be putting your print job up,\n\n164\n00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:59.260\nso many on a page and if they need,\nis it 1/8 inch or is it 1/4?\n\n165\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.696\nNo, it's an 1/8 inch.\n\n166\n00:09:00.696 --> 00:09:03.270\n&gt;&gt; Don't ask me an 1/8th, 1, 0.125,\nthat's what I got right there [LAUGH].\n\n167\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:09.462\n&gt;&gt; As I'm saying here, I'm like, is it a\n1/4 it's been awhile since I set up a job.\n\n168\n00:09:09.462 --> 00:09:11.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yes, that is the thing and\n\n169\n00:09:11.545 --> 00:09:15.925\nyou can say that it is lopped,\nI would normally always go ahead and\n\n170\n00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:18.330\nkeep them the same on all sides.\n\n171\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.300\nI don't think I've ever set up a bleed\ndifferent on one side versus the other,\n\n172\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.728\nbut in case you need to you can\nuncheck that and change them.\n\n173\n00:09:25.728 --> 00:09:30.840\nAnd like you said, you just basically\ndesign everything to get the colors or\n\n174\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.780\nthe pictures or anything past that\nbleed margin if you wanna call them.\n\n175\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.850\nAnd then once, like you said,\ngets the printer, they know to trim\n\n176\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.910\nwhere the document side is designated,\nthat's the 8.5x11.\n\n177\n00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.990\nEven though you're giving it\nextra space on the outside,\n\n178\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.609\noutside margins if you\nwanna call them that.\n\n179\n00:09:48.609 --> 00:09:50.915\n&gt;&gt; Aesthetically.\n\n180\n00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:56.946\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Vonne,\nthat's why we keep you [LAUGH].\n\n181\n00:09:56.946 --> 00:10:00.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just wanna make you feel good.\n\n182\n00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.660\nSo we'll go down there from our bleeds,\nand I'm gonna keep that bleed setting so\n\n183\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.580\nwe can see it when I actually\nopen a document into Color Mode.\n\n184\n00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.820\nSo with Color Mode,\n\n185\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:13.098\ntypically what we're gonna have is\nCMYK for print and RGB for web.\n\n186\n00:10:13.098 --> 00:10:17.300\nSo you wanna filter back and forth through\nthese depending on which particular\n\n187\n00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.730\nproject you are going to be working on.\n\n188\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.830\nNow if you are going to be working\non something that probably has both\n\n189\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.840\noptions to it, I would say,\ngo ahead and stick with the CMYK.\n\n190\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.660\nIt’s easier to convert a CMYK to\nRGB than it is to do the reverse so\n\n191\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.440\na lot of times I’ll just\nuse CMYK as the default.\n\n192\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.200\nYou have this option for more settings,\nthis takes us back into the old way of\n\n193\n00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.890\nlooking at the Illustrator workspace or\nthe File &gt; New.\n\n194\n00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.640\nAnd this will bring in some of these\nadvanced raster effects like PPI and\n\n195\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.447\nthings like that.\n\n196\n00:10:46.447 --> 00:10:48.920\n&gt;&gt; There it is, you found it.\n\n197\n00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.310\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm used to looking at it\nlike this, and I was like, hm, and\n\n198\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.140\nthen when you just clicked, I'm like,\nit's the old school button [LAUGH].\n\n199\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, basically.\n\n200\n00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.500\n&gt;&gt; And some of those advanced\nfeatures like the raster effects and\n\n201\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.660\nthe preview mode, honestly at this point,\nI would not worry about it.\n\n202\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.530\nI would just keep it at whatever\nthe default is, that's fine,\n\n203\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.264\nI don't even really mess with this\nstuff too much in the things that I do.\n\n204\n00:11:15.264 --> 00:11:18.310\nI'd say I'm pretty advanced,\n[LAUGH] So don't worry,\n\n205\n00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.870\nit's all good, you can just go ahead and\ncancel out that little button.\n\n206\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.768\nAnd not have to worry about any of those\nsettings because let's really just\n\n207\n00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:28.137\nconcentrate on the stuff that's on the\nleft, the other left, the right-hand side.\n\n208\n00:11:28.137 --> 00:11:31.087\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The right-hand, yes,\nnow I agree it's not something that I\n\n209\n00:11:31.087 --> 00:11:34.634\nwould typically touch but let's go back\nhere and actually create the document.\n\n210\n00:11:34.634 --> 00:11:36.895\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Create Document, and\n\n211\n00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:39.110\na couple things I just\nwanted to point out here.\n\n212\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.690\nI'm gonna use my command or\ncontrol minus sign to zoom out, one,\n\n213\n00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:47.300\nyou see those red lines, now the red\nlines, those are our bleed lines.\n\n214\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.800\nSo if I am going to be using a bleed I\nneed to draw things out to that red line,\n\n215\n00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.550\ntypically you would stop where the\nartboard stops, that white section there.\n\n216\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.967\nAnd then go ahead and instead,\nif you are going to be using a bleed,\n\n217\n00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:01.260\ndrag it to that red line.\n\n218\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.014\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it might be a little hard to see\nbecause the area outside of the artboard,\n\n219\n00:12:06.014 --> 00:12:07.519\n&gt;&gt; Called the Pasteboard.\n\n220\n00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.167\n&gt;&gt; Is it Pasteboard?\n\n221\n00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:11.507\n&gt;&gt; That what my teacher\ntold me back in the day.\n\n222\n00:12:11.507 --> 00:12:12.761\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I started going\ndown that path and I was like,\n\n223\n00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:13.644\nI forget what that thing is called.\n\n224\n00:12:13.644 --> 00:12:18.911\n&gt;&gt; I got you, I got you.\n\n225\n00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:23.455\n&gt;&gt; That whole thing, you can change\nthat color, I like how they've gone to\n\n226\n00:12:23.455 --> 00:12:28.410\nthe more dark pasteboard for\nyour user interface, it used to be white.\n\n227\n00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You could change that, and\n\n228\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.205\nthat's in your preferences,\nI think it's in the user interface.\n\n229\n00:12:32.205 --> 00:12:36.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, again, Edit if you're on a PC and\nthen I think you go down to\n\n230\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.860\nuser interface, and\nthen you can adjust the color settings.\n\n231\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.510\nI feel like this is more the old school\nmethod which I actually kept for\n\n232\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.400\na while, I don't know about you, I did.\n\n233\n00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.450\n&gt;&gt; I was resistant and\n\n234\n00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.984\nnow I'm like, I can't even\nimagine working in this [LAUGH].\n\n235\n00:12:49.984 --> 00:12:54.220\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it crazy when you want it back,\nwhen you put more light to the white part,\n\n236\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.634\nI was like, that's so bright, turn it off.\n\n237\n00:12:56.634 --> 00:12:59.347\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it hurts my eyes,\n[LAUGH] But yeah,\n\n238\n00:12:59.347 --> 00:13:03.700\nexactly, you go with what you work with or\nwhatever works for you.\n\n239\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.370\nBut what we're looking at here, we've got\nour artboard, the artboard is the actual\n\n240\n00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.020\nwhite part here, the pasteboard as\nwe've said is the grayish part there.\n\n241\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.790\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and pretend\nlike I've done something here just so\n\n242\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.390\nwe can talk about saving our file.\n\n243\n00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.190\nSo I'm gonna go ahead here,\ngo to my File menu and do a Save As.\n\n244\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.250\nNow you can probably guess if you're\naccustomed to Microsoft Word or\n\n245\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.930\nsomething like that, you are going\nto be using a File &gt; Save As.\n\n246\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.056\nSo File &gt; Save As is gonna go ahead and\nsave our files as an Illustrator document.\n\n247\n00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:31.598\nOf course,\n\n248\n00:13:31.598 --> 00:13:34.760\ngo onto your computer, wherever,\nyou wanna go ahead and save them.\n\n249\n00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.099\nI'm just saving them with the other\nthings that I've saved for\n\n250\n00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:39.157\nthis particular-\n&gt;&gt; Show.\n\n251\n00:13:39.157 --> 00:13:45.590\n&gt;&gt; Show, [LAUGH] The word episode\nwas really trying to come out there.\n\n252\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.950\n[LAUGH] So for this particular show,\nyou'll see some of those things later but\n\n253\n00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.630\nI'm just gonna go ahead and this format.\n\n254\n00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.331\nI'm gonna set that as Adobe Illustrator or\njust leave it as Adobe Illustrator,\n\n255\n00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:58.110\none of the other common ones\nthat you might use is Adobe PDF.\n\n256\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.150\nThose are two very popular formats now,\nwe'll get into some of this later.\n\n257\n00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:07.176\n&gt;&gt; And just as a little FYI,\nif you're looking for\n\n258\n00:14:07.176 --> 00:14:14.350\nJPEG and GIF and TIFF like you see\nin Photoshop, they're not here.\n\n259\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.150\nWe'll explain later when we talk\nabout exporting and how you get\n\n260\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.500\nfiles into their final format like\nthe TIFF's and the GIF's and the JPEG's.\n\n261\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.690\nThat we've talked about in our\nDesign 101 but it's not here, and\n\n262\n00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.490\nthat throws people off sometimes.\n\n263\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:32.318\nThey wanna do a File &gt; Save As,\nnope, you gotta go another method cuz\n\n264\n00:14:32.318 --> 00:14:36.092\nthis is vector information,\nyou have to save it in a vector format.\n\n265\n00:14:36.092 --> 00:14:36.670\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And those\n\n266\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.390\nare the ones that are available to you.\n\n267\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.900\n&gt;&gt; Yep, these are all our vector friendly\nformats, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n268\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.480\nsave as an Illustrator file,\ndo that File &gt; Save As.\n\n269\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.990\nOne thing I wanted to point\nout with this version,\n\n270\n00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.780\nnowadays this is not really so much of\na problem as it used to be back then.\n\n271\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.720\nIt used to be that you would\nget Illustrator installed on\n\n272\n00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.400\nyour computer with a CD.\n\n273\n00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.520\nAnd that people didn't update quite\nas frequently as they typically\n\n274\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.450\ndo with the CC.\n\n275\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.790\nNow that that Illustrator CC has\nbeen out for a few years and\n\n276\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.770\nyou can constantly keep updating.\n\n277\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.930\nYou don't have the issue that\nwe used to have which would be.\n\n278\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:15.760\nIf I have a version that's newer than\nyours and I'm trying to send you a file,\n\n279\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.250\nyou're not necessarily gonna be able\nto open it with full capabilities.\n\n280\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.530\nSo again, it's not really something\nyou really see quite as often now but\n\n281\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.890\nit's still something worth pointing out.\n\n282\n00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.820\nIf I'm trying to send this CC\nfile to somebody with CS6 or\n\n283\n00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.520\nCCS5 or anything like that.\n\n284\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:36.450\nI need to go ahead and save my file with\nthat particular version applied to it.\n\n285\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.937\nSo it's just gonna depend, sometimes\nI'll send something to my client and\n\n286\n00:15:39.937 --> 00:15:42.673\nthey'll be like,\nyeah I have illustrator on my computer.\n\n287\n00:15:42.673 --> 00:15:45.058\nAnd they probably installed\nit ten years ago but\n\n288\n00:15:45.058 --> 00:15:47.330\nthey need to be able to open up the file.\n\n289\n00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.530\nSo sometimes, you do want to\nhave to pay attention to that or\n\n290\n00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.090\nyou do need to use that.\n\n291\n00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.310\nI'm just gonna go ahead and hit OK, and\nnow you're gonna see, I didn't give it\n\n292\n00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.270\na name so it's just called untitled 5 but\nyou can see what that would be like there.\n\n293\n00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.725\nAnd then if I do this File &gt; Save As and\nI go here and I save as a PDF, I can do\n\n294\n00:16:02.725 --> 00:16:07.960\na File &gt; Save As as a PDF,\ncool, everything looks good.\n\n295\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.820\nI usually do a vPDF after saving,\n\n296\n00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.070\nI select that option, and\nI can see that's saved there.\n\n297\n00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.660\nNow what I will notice is that you\nare now working on untitled5.PDF so\n\n298\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:23.610\nany changes that I make to this are gonna\nbe separate from that untitled5.ai file.\n\n299\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.150\nAnd I just wanted to point that out\ncuz I know that that's something that\n\n300\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.820\ntrips people up.\n\n301\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.780\nSo typically if you're working and\nyou have to save something as a PDF.\n\n302\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.800\nJust wait until you're done with it or\nwait till the very end to go ahead and\n\n303\n00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.950\nsave it as a PDF.\n\n304\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:41.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a huge one right there,\nit seems very slight but it's big because\n\n305\n00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.590\nIllustrator can open and\nread EPS files, PDF files.\n\n306\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.190\nYou can get a File &gt; Open on a PDF and\nget into all sorts of stuff,\n\n307\n00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.250\nI can mess me up a PDF really well\nif I open it up in Illustrator.\n\n308\n00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.788\nBut yes, definitely keep notice of that,\nand I have done that where I've saved it\n\n309\n00:16:58.788 --> 00:17:04.170\nas the EPS version because somebody needed\nthat particular file format for my logo.\n\n310\n00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.560\nI didn't pay attention, I'm working on the\nEPS, I changed some colors and everything,\n\n311\n00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.980\nsave it and go back.\n\n312\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.890\nThe next day, I open up my AI file,\n\n313\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.990\nmy native file that I'm\nalways supposed to work with.\n\n314\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.820\nAnd then I'm like,\n\n315\n00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.880\nwait I thought I changed that to pink,\nwhy didn't I do that?\n\n316\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.018\nI did it on the EPS and didn't even\nnotice that I wasn't on that native file.\n\n317\n00:17:24.018 --> 00:17:30.330\nYou always wanna keep your source native\nfiles in the AI format to be on that one.\n\n318\n00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:35.940\nDon't work on your finished version files,\nand just always make sure you do that,\n\n319\n00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.886\nalways, I'm telling you, I've got myself\nup a creek really fast that way so.\n\n320\n00:17:40.886 --> 00:17:43.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nit'll trip you up pretty easy,\n\n321\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.170\nthat's why we bring it up now to try and\nhopefully avoid those problems later.\n\n322\n00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.197\nBut I really think that's it\nin terms of File &gt; New and\n\n323\n00:17:50.197 --> 00:17:52.640\nlooking through and working through that.\n\n324\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.570\nAs we move, we'll probably point out some\nother things throughout these episodes but\n\n325\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:57.970\nI think that'll give us a good start.\n\n326\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.868\n&gt;&gt; Always a good place to start, File &gt;\nNew, save your file and know your formats.\n\n327\n00:18:03.868 --> 00:18:06.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I think that covers\n\n328\n00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:11.345\neverything for this episode, so we're\ngoing to wrap this one up and sign off for\n\n329\n00:18:11.345 --> 00:18:13.610\nCreativeProTV, I've been\nyour host Vonne Smith.\n\n330\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.540\n&gt;&gt;

for\n\n9\n00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.933\nhaving us, having us here?\n\n10\n00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.475\nHaving you here with us.\n\n11\n00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:39.666\n[LAUGHING]\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to my home, yes, [LAUGH] no,\n\n12\n00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.890\nI'm glad to be here, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.430\nI knew what you were getting at,\n[LAUGH] so\n\n14\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.330\nyeah, we're gonna be talking\nabout basic selections today.\n\n15\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.736\nSo kinda what does that mean?\n\n16\n00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:54.044\nSome of it I think sounds like, okay,\ndo we really need to talk about that?\n\n17\n00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:55.800\nLike, can I not figure that out?\n\n18\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.794\nWell, [SOUND] couple little things that\nyou wanna kinda point out with it.\n\n19\n00:00:58.794 --> 00:01:01.190\nSo let's go ahead and\npop into my screen here.\n\n20\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.208\nAnd I think we can make this one available\nin one of the exercise files as well so\n\n21\n00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:05.990\nyou can kinda be working with this too.\n\n22\n00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.490\nI am starting out in my black arrow tool.\n\n23\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.710\nMy black arrow tool is going to\nbe just my general selection,\n\n24\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.020\nif I can say that, tool that I wanna use.\n\n25\n00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.150\nNow I've got a couple, a little\n\n26\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.270\ndifferent things going on in\nmy Illustrator Artboard here.\n\n27\n00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.950\nJust to kinda show you some of\nthe different selection methods, and\n\n28\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.630\nhow this kinda changes\ndepending on what I have.\n\n29\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.480\nNow you can kinda scroll through here.\n\n30\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.350\nWell, this is my cat Ollie,\nwell meet him again in a future episode.\n\n31\n00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.050\nDon't worry, this will not be\nyour only experience with my cat.\n\n32\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.000\nBut you can kind of see\nwhat happens when I hover\n\n33\n00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.920\nover each of these individual pieces.\n\n34\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.500\nI'm starting to see a couple\nof differences here.\n\n35\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.350\nNow we'll start off with just\nkind of our most basic shape.\n\n36\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.640\nI have a shape with a fill and a stroke.\n\n37\n00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.603\nAnd what we're gonna look at here is how\nour arrows are gonna change depending on\n\n38\n00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:57.519\nwhat I have kind of selected,\nor what I'm hovering over.\n\n39\n00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:00.780\nAnd what Illustrator's gonna tell\nme just with my cursor icon.\n\n40\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.170\nSo you can see when I'm hovering over\nhere, and I'm hovering over nothing,\n\n41\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.810\nI'm gonna get that standard just\nkind of arrowhead type cursor.\n\n42\n00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.510\nAnd then when I hover over something\nthat can be selected, I'm gonna get that\n\n43\n00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.490\narrowhead, but then I'm also gonna\nget a little black square at the end.\n\n44\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.770\nThat's just kind of a little\ntail that let's me know,\n\n45\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.110\nokay, I'm hovering over\nsomething that I can select.\n\n46\n00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.910\nNow, when I go ahead and\nactually select that,\n\n47\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.536\nyou're gonna see a couple things happen.\n\n48\n00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:28.569\nOne, I'm gonna see that path outline,\nso you see that circle,\n\n49\n00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.746\nI see that blue outline around it.\n\n50\n00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:34.340\nOr in this case, blue, it might be\ndifferent color on something else.\n\n51\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.470\nAnd then you're also gonna see that my\ncursor changed from that v with the tail,\n\n52\n00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.680\nto a v and kind of like a box\nwith a bunch of points on it.\n\n53\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.290\nThat's just basically letting you\nknow that you have a path selected.\n\n54\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.770\nSo that's just Illustrator's way of\ngiving you a couple kinda tips on that.\n\n55\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.210\nAnd you may be thinking, okay,\nlike do I really need to know that?\n\n56\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.210\nIs that really helpful?\n\n57\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.490\nWell what happens when I swirl over here?\n\n58\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.520\nSee how, okay,\nI'm in the middle of the circle,\n\n59\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.900\nshouldn't I be able to select something?\n\n60\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.450\nYou can see Illustrator's not giving\nme that tail at the end of that.\n\n61\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.000\nSo I'm just hovering over something and\nI can't select it.\n\n62\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.030\nNow why can I not select it?\n\n63\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.300\nBecause what I'm hovering over has\na stroke color applied to it, but\n\n64\n00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.590\nthere is no fill,\nthere's no color in the middle of this.\n\n65\n00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.940\nSo what I have to do\nbecause it has a stroke and\n\n66\n00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.550\nno fill, I need to select it somewhere\non the outsiders of the path.\n\n67\n00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.800\nI think you can also select\nit in the direct center,\n\n68\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.650\nI typically just go somewhere\non the outside edge of the path.\n\n69\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.580\nAnd sometimes this can\nkinda throw people off,\n\n70\n00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.150\nespecially I have a pretty\nthick stroke here.\n\n71\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.890\nBut if you don't, sometimes it\ncan be a little hard to select.\n\n72\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.510\nA little tip that I would use,\n\n73\n00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.500\njust kinda go somewhere off to the side\nin the negative space, if you will.\n\n74\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.310\nClick, hold, and drag over that, and\nit will go ahead and select that for you.\n\n75\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.500\nSo if you're having trouble\npinpointing exactly where that is.\n\n76\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.740\nLike we're gonna see\nthe same thing over here.\n\n77\n00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.910\nIt might be kinda hard, well,\nof course I just did it immediately.\n\n78\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.610\nBut I'm pretty accustomed\nto working in Illustrator.\n\n79\n00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.760\nIt might be kinda hard to select that,\ncuz that's a little bit thinner.\n\n80\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.230\nAnd they can even get thinner than that,\nthat's still only a 1 point,\n\n81\n00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.220\nI can go down to 0.25 or\nsomething like that.\n\n82\n00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.960\nJust click hold and\n\n83\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.240\ndrag off to the side if you're having\na little bit of an issue there.\n\n84\n00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.572\nNow a couple other things that I wanted\nto point out, okay, looking at this text.\n\n85\n00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:15.201\nWhat is text look like when I go ahead and\nselect it?\n\n86\n00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:18.171\nLooking at that image I kinda\npointed that out before you can see,\n\n87\n00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:20.175\nokay that gets that\nlittle x through there.\n\n88\n00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:25.090\nBut still otherwise looks about the same,\nnow you'll kinda notice as I'm selecting\n\n89\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.610\nthese things, look at the way my control\npanel changes, or that options bar.\n\n90\n00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.020\nOr whatever you wanna call it,\nthis top section here.\n\n91\n00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.980\nA lot of information\nabout what I'm selecting\n\n92\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.720\nis gonna come out in the way\nthat our control bar changes.\n\n93\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.850\nSo, you can see here if I look all\nthe way on the left hand side that's\n\n94\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.340\nletting me know that I have a linked file.\n\n95\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.560\nWe'll talk about what a linked\nfile means in a separate episode.\n\n96\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.830\nI select this text, it's gonna say type.\n\n97\n00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.157\nI select this, it's gonna say symbol\nstatic, you're gonna be like,\n\n98\n00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.910\nwhat the heck does that mean?\n\n99\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.355\nDon't worry about it, but\nthat's what I've got.\n\n100\n00:04:55.355 --> 00:04:58.257\nI've got another one over here,\nI've got this, ellipse, but\n\n101\n00:04:58.257 --> 00:05:00.536\nit's got the same issue with that center,\nokay.\n\n102\n00:05:00.536 --> 00:05:03.790\nI'm clicking here, I'm trying to click\nin the center, nothing's happening.\n\n103\n00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.360\nNow something else that\nyou'll notice with this one,\n\n104\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.640\nwhen I was selecting everything else,\nI had a blue path outline.\n\n105\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.900\nWhat happened to that blue path outline,\nwhy is this one red?\n\n106\n00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.470\nThis one's red because technically\nI'm working on a different layer.\n\n107\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.000\nNow again layers are something that we're\ngonna discuss in a different episode but\n\n108\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.910\nI don't want it to trip you up\nthinking what did I do is this one bad\n\n109\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.215\nis that why it's red, is something wrong.\n\n110\n00:05:26.215 --> 00:05:29.930\nNo, nothing's wrong it's just that it's\nkind of organized in a different way.\n\n111\n00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.560\nSo don't let that bother you, again, we'll\ntalk about layers in a different episode\n\n112\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.200\nand you can kind of start to\nunderstand what some of that means.\n\n113\n00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.060\nSelecting multiple objects,\n\n114\n00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.950\nso if I had different things\nthat I wanna select together.\n\n115\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.140\nObviously, you're not always\ngonna just select one thing and\n\n116\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.400\nthen select another and move it, so on.\n\n117\n00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.780\nSometimes you want to\nmove things as a unit.\n\n118\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.530\nWhat I can do to select multiple objects,\nI can either select something and\n\n119\n00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.160\nthen shift click to select something else.\n\n120\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.700\nAnd then shift click to select another\nobject and then move it from there.\n\n121\n00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.290\nOr what I can do, and this is probably\nwhat I do most often unless I\n\n122\n00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.280\nreally need to pinpoint something.\n\n123\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.485\nI can select everything by just\nclick hold and drag around it.\n\n124\n00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:10.890\nKinda create a little marquis\nbox if you will, around it, and\n\n125\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.898\nthat will go ahead and\nselect everything for you.\n\n126\n00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then the nice thing\nabout that like click, hold,\n\n127\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.630\ndrag make a selection marquis,\nyou might hear us refer to,\n\n128\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.020\nis you don't have to fully encompass it.\n\n129\n00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.270\nAnd you can just like\njust barely touch it,\n\n130\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.010\nyou don't have to get\nall the way around it.\n\n131\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.990\nSo just a little tip on that one.\n\n132\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.259\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just kinda like how\n\n133\n00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:32.546\nyou did with the squiggly\nline up at the top.\n\n134\n00:06:32.546 --> 00:06:35.092\nYou didn't have to\ncompletely go around it,\n\n135\n00:06:35.092 --> 00:06:38.777\nyou just got a little section of it and\nit was able to select it, and\n\n136\n00:06:38.777 --> 00:06:41.870\nthat's a lot of the ways that I do it too,\ndefinitely.\n\n137\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.443\nBut if something's way far apart and it's\nlike on the other side of the picture, and\n\n138\n00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:46.953\nI didn't' wanna get the picture,\n\n139\n00:06:46.953 --> 00:06:50.760\nthat's something that I would probably use\nthe shift click, and that right there.\n\n140\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.910\nDid you see how when she\nselected that one and\n\n141\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.450\nthat one,\nthat the selection box looks really big?\n\n142\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.140\nBut it looks like it has like the flower,\nand the text,\n\n143\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.700\nand the pink circle,\nthose aren't selected.\n\n144\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.520\nThose don't have like a little\noutlines that she was talking about.\n\n145\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.650\nYes, there's the bounding box\nas sometimes we refer to it as,\n\n146\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.820\nthat's showing everything that\nyou could like move and size and\n\n147\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.430\nstuff like that, but\nthose are the only two things selected.\n\n148\n00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nthat's a good thing to point out.\n\n149\n00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.610\nI don't have all this, you're not seeing\nany of that kind of color outline,\n\n150\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.590\nthat's how that lets us know.\n\n151\n00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.620\nNow another thing that I wanted to point\nout was this concept of isolation mode.\n\n152\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.420\nSo what happens here if I double click on\nsomething, whether it be an individual\n\n153\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.210\nitem or what I'm looking at here which\nis technically known as a group.\n\n154\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.960\nYou can see group in\nthe top left hand corner.\n\n155\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.670\nDon't need to know what\na group is right now.\n\n156\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.970\nWhether or not I double click on\nan individual item or I double click over\n\n157\n00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.070\nhere onto this thing known as a group it's\ngonna take me into this isolation mode.\n\n158\n00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.620\nSo how do we know we're in isolation mode?\n\n159\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.280\nA couple things going on, one, everything\nelse in the background kind of faded out.\n\n160\n00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.310\nNow because I was selecting a group,\ntwo items stayed kind of highlighted.\n\n161\n00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.090\nIf I were to select on an individual item,\nonly one thing gets highlighted.\n\n162\n00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.980\nBut, that doesn't necessarily matter,\nwe can deal with that later.\n\n163\n00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.119\nEverything else is kind of faded out.\n\n164\n00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:10.118\nI also see it right here, so okay,\nin this top left hand section just below\n\n165\n00:08:10.118 --> 00:08:13.227\nmy control bar, I have layer two and\nthen I have ellipse.\n\n166\n00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:15.070\nThat's just letting me know where I'm at.\n\n167\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.260\nNow, If I get here on accident it's okay,\n\n168\n00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.670\nall we have to do is just\ndouble click somewhere else.\n\n169\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.850\nTry not to double click on\nan actual object or a path.\n\n170\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.110\nTry to just double click kind\nof off in your pace board or\n\n171\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.870\nsome of the negative space area.\n\n172\n00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.990\nAnd you can go ahead and\nget yourself out of isolation mode.\n\n173\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.482\nSo those are just a couple little things\nthat we wanted you guys to be aware of as\n\n174\n00:08:34.482 --> 00:08:36.064\nyou're working in Illustrator.\n\n175\n00:08:36.064 --> 00:08:38.800\nAnd things that you need to kinda pay\nattention to with your selection.\n\n176\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.360\nSo again, it may not necessarily seem like\na big deal, but when you get caught up in\n\n177\n00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.590\na situation where you're trying to select\nsomething and it's just not working.\n\n178\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.460\nYou need to kinda be aware\nof some of those tips.\n\n179\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:53.373\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and those little things,\nlike that dot or tail or the little\n\n180\n00:08:53.373 --> 00:08:58.570\nkind of square thing on the bottom\nright hand of the mouse cursor icon.\n\n181\n00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.494\nSuper tiny but\nvery important to understand that,\n\n182\n00:09:01.494 --> 00:09:03.740\nthat's where we're over something.\n\n183\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.780\nAnd if you don't see a dot, then you're\nnot over it, and you can't select it.\n\n184\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.900\nAnd the same thing when like when you're\nmoving, if you have something selected and\n\n185\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.990\nyou don't see that little like\na box with the points, or\n\n186\n00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.320\nwhatever that little thing was.\n\n187\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.190\nAnd you try to start moving something,\nit's not gonna move, okay.\n\n188\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:23.670\nBecause everything depends on what\nyour mouse cursor icon looks like.\n\n189\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.680\nThat's why I always tell people\nin every single program, stop,\n\n190\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.950\ntake a breath, look at what's happening.\n\n191\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.010\nWhat's on the screen?\n\n192\n00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.135\nCuz that's gonna tell\nyou what's gonna happen.\n\n193\n00:09:33.135 --> 00:09:33.800\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n194\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.010\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's why we wanted\nto throw this one out there.\n\n195\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.570\nNice little brief\nintroduction to selections.\n\n196\n00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.909\nYou'll be seeing you selecting all day\nlong or however long these episodes are.\n\n197\n00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:44.649\n&gt;&gt; However long you wanna watch it, yeah.\n\n198\n00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.766\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, lots and\n\n199\n00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:48.762\nlots of selections going on.\n\n200\n00:09:48.762 --> 00:09:52.697\nBut I think that's enough for now, we're\ngonna go ahead and wrap this one up and\n\n201\n00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:56.246\nsigning off for our CreativePro TV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n202\n00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:57.299\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n203\n00:09:57.299 --> 00:09:57.930\n&gt;&gt; We will see you soon.\n\n204\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.216\n[SOUND]\n\n",

to\nanother great episode of CreativeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:16.147\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n5\n00:00:16.147 --> 00:00:20.822\nAnd we're continuing on with\nour Illustrator CC 2017 series.\n\n6\n00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:23.424\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna be talking about shapes.\n\n7\n00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:25.966\nAnd here to help us, is Miss Emily Ramsey.\n\n8\n00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.116\nHello, how are you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:28.056\n&gt;&gt; Hey, good, how are you?\n\n10\n00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:29.681\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing swimmingly.\n\n11\n00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:31.157\n&gt;&gt; You're excited to make something?\n\n12\n00:00:31.157 --> 00:00:31.911\n&gt;&gt; I am!\n\n13\n00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:34.652\nYes, so we're doing shapes.\n\n14\n00:00:34.652 --> 00:00:37.200\nSo I feel like we're going back\nto kindergarten, aren't we?\n\n15\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.901\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, yeah, circle,\nsquares, and all that exciting stuff.\n\n16\n00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:40.451\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:41.412\n&gt;&gt; And I don't have to use\n\n18\n00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:42.934\nthe left-handed scissors, do I?\n\n19\n00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:43.830\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n20\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, they didn't work.\n\n21\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.232\n&gt;&gt; I was not so good with the scissors.\n\n22\n00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:48.218\n&gt;&gt; Me neither, I was so\nused to right-handed scissors.\n\n23\n00:00:48.218 --> 00:00:51.075\nAnd they would always try to make,\nI'm like, this doesn't work for me.\n\n24\n00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:51.818\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n25\n00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:52.956\n&gt;&gt; We'll be all right.\n\n26\n00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:54.697\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad we can relate.\n\n27\n00:00:54.697 --> 00:00:57.788\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So where are we going to start?\n\n28\n00:00:57.788 --> 00:00:58.845\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n29\n00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:03.024\n&gt;&gt; We're just gonna start off with some\nbasic square, circle, all of those kind of\n\n30\n00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:06.403\nsimple shapes that you would do and\nyou think of it and you go like,\n\n31\n00:01:06.403 --> 00:01:10.240\nI say the word basic and simple and\nit kind of makes it seem like it's okay.\n\n32\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.370\nThis is kind of lame but\n\n33\n00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.350\nreally this is gonna be the foundation\nof anything that you do in Illustrator.\n\n34\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.010\nSo you'll look at like some of these\nfamous logos, think about the Target logo.\n\n35\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.480\nThe Target logo is two circles, things\nlike that, are all just really simple but\n\n36\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.488\nare gonna be the foundation for\neverything that you do in Illustrator.\n\n37\n00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:28.860\nSo we're gonna now start off with\ncreating those basic shapes,\n\n38\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.710\ngetting some basic editing done and then\nalso just kind of applying some color and\n\n39\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.120\ngetting into more of the fun\nstuff of Illustrator.\n\n40\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.910\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n41\n00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.760\nIn Illustrator,\nwhat we're looking at here,\n\n42\n00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.760\npretty much everything works off of\neither a closed path or an open path.\n\n43\n00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.350\nThese aren't gonna be essential that you\nknow necessarily right off the bat, but\n\n44\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.280\nit's just kind of nice to\nknow the correct terminology.\n\n45\n00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.540\nSo a closed path is gonna be,\nbasically what you're looking at.\n\n46\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.320\nIt's anything that's kind of a closed,\nsquare shape.\n\n47\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.150\nYou see we have four sides, you know\nyou can see it's kind of filled in,\n\n48\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.320\nsomething like that.\n\n49\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.816\nAnd open path is basically just gonna\nbe anything that kinda looks like\n\n50\n00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:02.920\na straight line.\n\n51\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.080\nSo it's open, there's nothing kinda\nconnecting it, ending it, starting it,\n\n52\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.530\nall that stuff.\n\n53\n00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.400\nSo when we are making shapes,\n\n54\n00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.860\npretty much all this is gonna\nbe working off of the Tool bar.\n\n55\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.405\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nkinda start on the left-hand side.\n\n56\n00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:18.006\nOn our toolbar, pretty much any\ntime you see something, like for\n\n57\n00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:20.441\nhere I'm gonna look at the Rectangle Tool.\n\n58\n00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:24.288\nBut you'll notice with the Rectangle Tool\nwe have that little arrow there kinda next\n\n59\n00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:26.490\nto it in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n60\n00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.510\nAny time you see that arrow that basically\nlet's you know that you have some\n\n61\n00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.390\nhidden shapes underneath that.\n\n62\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.170\nSo in our case if I click on that\nRectangle Tool and hold it down, that's\n\n63\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.280\nwhere I'm gonna get all of the other\nbasic shapes that I'm working with here.\n\n64\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.270\nSo we have a rounded Rectangle Tool,\nour Ellipse Tool, yadda yadda yadda.\n\n65\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.246\nWhat I can also do with this,\nif you're one of these kind of people,\n\n66\n00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:47.597\nI could click on this arrow\non the right-hand side and\n\n67\n00:02:47.597 --> 00:02:50.337\nthat's gonna kinda pull it off,\nso I can separate those out.\n\n68\n00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.262\nI'm not really one to do this,\nit's not my thing, but\n\n69\n00:02:53.262 --> 00:02:55.176\nyou can do it if you're welcome to.\n\n70\n00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:56.455\n&gt;&gt; I love the tear off.\n\n71\n00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:57.291\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n72\n00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:59.647\n&gt;&gt; I'll have tons of them over there.\n\n73\n00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:03.240\nAnd it's just, I don't know,\nthat's just the way I like to do it.\n\n74\n00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.011\nAnd I'm making sure,\nyou still have to like click and\n\n75\n00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:09.769\nhold down which is different than\nPhotoshop where you click and let go and\n\n76\n00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.432\nlike the little menu if you want to say,\nstays out.\n\n77\n00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:15.637\nYou have to hold the mouse button down or\nit goes away.\n\n78\n00:03:15.637 --> 00:03:18.521\n&gt;&gt; Right, that is kind of one of\nthe weird things with getting used to.\n\n79\n00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:20.181\nOr no, actually no I lied.\n\n80\n00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:22.038\nNow I think they changed it and\nyou can click it.\n\n81\n00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:23.269\nYes, I'm so accustomed to it.\n\n82\n00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.382\nI think back in the day\nthey had it like that.\n\n83\n00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:28.140\nAnd then now you can click hold and\ndown and let go.\n\n84\n00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.100\nBut yeah, if you're one of those people,\nyou wanna do the tear off,\n\n85\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.207\nthen by all means.\n\n86\n00:03:33.207 --> 00:03:34.111\n&gt;&gt; I think that's what it's called.\n\n87\n00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:34.971\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n88\n00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:36.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At least that's what it was called.\n\n89\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.546\nThey like to change the names on us a lot,\nso it's like okay.\n\n90\n00:03:38.546 --> 00:03:39.649\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's just mean.\n\n91\n00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.478\n[LAUGH] So if you wanna do that,\nyou're fine.\n\n92\n00:03:42.478 --> 00:03:44.460\nI'm not gonna do that today, but you can.\n\n93\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.020\nSo pretty much anything that we're\ngonna be talking about here is\n\n94\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.010\nall going to apply the same,\nfrom our Rectangle Tool to our Star Tool.\n\n95\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.860\nNow, the Flare Tool, totally different.\n\n96\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.850\nThis is gonna be the thing that's like,\nI'm gonna tell you not to push the button.\n\n97\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.370\nAnd because I told you\nnot to push the button,\n\n98\n00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.810\nyou're gonna be like, yeah,\nI wanna open up my Flare Tool.\n\n99\n00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.530\nAnd I understand.\n\n100\n00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.040\nBut the Flare Tool, for\nsome reason, is just way different.\n\n101\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.010\nSo for right now, let's start with\na rectangle through the square and\n\n102\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.150\nkinda go through there.\n\n103\n00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.410\nSo anything that I'm gonna say,\nI'm gonna start off with a Rectangle Tool,\n\n104\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.980\nbut anything I'm gonna say\nwill apply to all of these.\n\n105\n00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.050\nSo I'm gonna grab my Rectangle Tool and\n\n106\n00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.450\njust to create a basic shape\nwe have two different methods.\n\n107\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.670\nWe can either single click or\nclick, hold, and drag.\n\n108\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.010\nSo I'll start off with a single click.\n\n109\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.340\nI've grabbed my Rectangle Tool.\n\n110\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.940\nI'm gonna single click anywhere on my\nart board, or really anywhere is fine.\n\n111\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.460\nAnd the nice thing about this\nmethod is that you can go ahead and\n\n112\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.850\ntype in some specific dimensions.\n\n113\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.910\nSo if you know,\nI have to have a three by five rectangle.\n\n114\n00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.970\nYou can go ahead and type that in.\n\n115\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.040\nSo I'll type in three by five.\n\n116\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.990\nGo ahead and hit OK.\n\n117\n00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.556\nWell, bam,\nI have a three by five rectangle.\n\n118\n00:04:42.556 --> 00:04:46.462\nOr if you're like me and\nmaybe you just kinda wanna play around and\n\n119\n00:04:46.462 --> 00:04:49.030\nfiddle with it till you\nfind what you like.\n\n120\n00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.700\nYou can click hold and drag and\n\n121\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.350\nkinda just create something\nthat looks about appropriate.\n\n122\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.500\nSo those are your two different methods.\n\n123\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.030\nNow with these methods, and\n\n124\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.790\nI'm just gonna delete these,\nI'll show you how to do that in a second,\n\n125\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.640\nyou have two different kind of keyword\nshortcuts that you can work with.\n\n126\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.110\nSo two different options.\n\n127\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.930\nOne, say I wanna make a perfect square.\n\n128\n00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.640\nRight here I've been kinda\njust doing whatever, but\n\n129\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.630\nif I wanna make a perfect square, what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna hold down my Shift\n\n130\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.010\nkey as I'm drawing out and\ncreating a new square.\n\n131\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.220\nSo anytime I hold down my Shift key in\nIllustrator, or other Adobe programs,\n\n132\n00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.492\nit's pretty similar, what's that's gonna\ndo is it's gonna maintain proportion.\n\n133\n00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.340\nSo that's gonna be a little bit different\nlater when we get into editing but\n\n134\n00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.070\nas far as creating a new shape,\nit's going to create a perfect square or\n\n135\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.770\nagain likewise perfect circle, perfect\nstar if you wanted to, anything like that.\n\n136\n00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.422\nSo that's definitely one\nthat you wanna remember.\n\n137\n00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:42.080\nYou wanna go ahead and\nremember your Shift key.\n\n138\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.575\nNow the other one, you'll notice that all\nof your shapes by default are created from\n\n139\n00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:49.220\nthe top left hand corner down.\n\n140\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.420\nIf for\nsome reason you're not feeling that,\n\n141\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.560\nthat's not what you wanna\nwork with that day.\n\n142\n00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.690\nWhat you can also do is you can also\nhold down your Alt or Option key.\n\n143\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.400\nIt's gonna be Alt on a PC,\nOption on a Mac.\n\n144\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.480\nOr if you're like me I'm on a Mac and\nI call it Alt anyway.\n\n145\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.700\nYou can hold down your Alt or Option key\nto create something from the center out.\n\n146\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.390\nSo that's also an option that\nyou have when working here.\n\n147\n00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.380\nNow, as far as editing goes,\n\n148\n00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.310\nediting is always gonna be\ndone in our Black Arrow Tool.\n\n149\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.139\nSo you have to remember, back to black.\n\n150\n00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.672\nYou were the one that taught me that.\n\n151\n00:06:18.672 --> 00:06:19.194\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n152\n00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:21.377\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like, she remembers.\n\n153\n00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:24.329\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's my favorite little saying.\n\n154\n00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:25.374\nBack to black.\n\n155\n00:06:25.374 --> 00:06:28.625\nThat's always gonna be where I'm\ngonna do my editing in Illustrator.\n\n156\n00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:33.262\nAnd so what we have, Illustrator it's\nkinda nice they give these little\n\n157\n00:06:33.262 --> 00:06:37.762\nkinda visual cues to what you're\ngonna be working with your editing.\n\n158\n00:06:37.762 --> 00:06:42.215\nSo you'll see when I have just kinda\nhanging out over here anywhere my art\n\n159\n00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:45.062\nboard my workspace,\nI have just kinda that V,\n\n160\n00:06:45.062 --> 00:06:48.840\nthat V is just kinda my neutral cursor,\nif you will.\n\n161\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.938\nWhen I hover over something that can be\nselected you'll see a hover over here,\n\n162\n00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:54.440\nI get a little dot at the end.\n\n163\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.977\nThat's just letting me know that I'm\nhovering over something that can\n\n164\n00:06:56.977 --> 00:06:57.491\nbe selected.\n\n165\n00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:00.631\nAnd then when I go ahead and\nselect that I'm gonna get to that V but\n\n166\n00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:03.847\nthen I'm gonna get kinda like\na little box thing there at the end.\n\n167\n00:07:03.847 --> 00:07:07.839\nAnd that's just letting me know that the\nshape that I'm hovering over is something\n\n168\n00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:08.932\nthat I have selected.\n\n169\n00:07:08.932 --> 00:07:12.171\nNow you can also see it because\nyou see the blue path outlines.\n\n170\n00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:14.806\nYou know they're gonna have several\ndifferent ways that they're kinda giving\n\n171\n00:07:14.806 --> 00:07:15.404\nthis away to you.\n\n172\n00:07:15.404 --> 00:07:18.422\nBut then when you'll see when you\nkinda hover around, basically for\n\n173\n00:07:18.422 --> 00:07:21.141\nright now I'm just gonna say\nhover around these white boxes.\n\n174\n00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:25.370\nWhen I hover around these white boxes I\nsee kinda some of the standard things that\n\n175\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.640\nyou're kinda used to.\n\n176\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.660\nSo I can see if I hover here,\n\n177\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.458\nI get the double pointed arrows in\nthe corner, double pointed arrows there.\n\n178\n00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:37.920\nIf you hover slightly on the outside,\nyou can see the rotate option.\n\n179\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.698\nIf I hover here, those double pointed\narrows so on and so forth, and\n\n180\n00:07:41.698 --> 00:07:46.209\nI think those are pretty standard computer\nbased things but still nice to know for\n\n181\n00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:49.600\njust working in Illustrator\ngenerally speaking.\n\n182\n00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.365\nAnd one thing to note is that those\nkeyboard shortcuts with your editing\n\n183\n00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:56.689\nare still gonna apply, so\nI can hold down my Shift key while I'm\n\n184\n00:07:56.689 --> 00:08:01.104\ndragging from the corner and that's again,\ngonna maintain perfect proportion.\n\n185\n00:08:01.104 --> 00:08:04.147\nSo when I say that if I have\na rectangle to begin with And\n\n186\n00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:06.526\nthen I'm holding down my Shift key here.\n\n187\n00:08:06.526 --> 00:08:09.298\nIt's gonna maintain\nthe proportions of that rectangle.\n\n188\n00:08:09.298 --> 00:08:10.830\nIt's not gonna make a perfect square.\n\n189\n00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.341\nIt's just gonna maintain\nthe proportions that we had before.\n\n190\n00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:17.223\nLikewise, holding down my Alt or Option\nkey, or even if you wanna be really crazy,\n\n191\n00:08:17.223 --> 00:08:18.172\nholding down both.\n\n192\n00:08:18.172 --> 00:08:22.600\nYou could maintain proportions and then\nalso create something from the center out.\n\n193\n00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.725\nSo, that's kinda your basic creating and\nediting.\n\n194\n00:08:26.725 --> 00:08:30.510\nWe'll get really fun and exciting now and\nactually add some colors.\n\n195\n00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.530\n[LAUGH] And I'm gonna go ahead and\njust delete these guys off of here.\n\n196\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.330\nTo delete,\nyou just wanna select something.\n\n197\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.520\nEither single click it or I just kinda\ndrag off to the side, select something.\n\n198\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.070\nAnd I wanna go ahead make this\na little bit more exciting to look at.\n\n199\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.280\nNobody wants to look at a white and\nblack square.\n\n200\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.530\nSo, in Illustrator,\n\n201\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.120\nor really in any Adobe program,\nyou have two different color options.\n\n202\n00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.260\nYou have what's known as either your\nfill color, or your stroke color.\n\n203\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.430\nSo what we're actually looking at right\nnow, even though it kinda looks just\n\n204\n00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.360\nblank, we're looking at a square with\na white fill and a black stroke.\n\n205\n00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.320\nSo it's actually filled\nin white on the inside,\n\n206\n00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.220\neven though you don't necessarily see it.\n\n207\n00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.010\nBut how I can tell that, and how it's\nkind of reflected to me in Illustrator,\n\n208\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.020\nit's actually reflected to me\nin several places, I should say.\n\n209\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.580\nOne, kinda the easiest, method that\nI like to use, top left-hand corner.\n\n210\n00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.385\nJust look in this Control Panel.\n\n211\n00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:21.546\nYou're gonna see, okay,\nI have a white there and then a black.\n\n212\n00:09:21.546 --> 00:09:23.968\nOkay, why are those kinda separated,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n213\n00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:26.374\nThat's our fill color and\nour stroke color.\n\n214\n00:09:26.374 --> 00:09:29.434\nSo the fill color is gonna\nbe the one that's filled in.\n\n215\n00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:33.431\nThe one that has kinda the empty box\ninside of it, that's our stroke color.\n\n216\n00:09:33.431 --> 00:09:36.423\nSo what we're looking at here, that\nstroke color is just kind of our outline.\n\n217\n00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:39.686\nAnd when I refer to something,\nI say, okay, I have a white box,\n\n218\n00:09:39.686 --> 00:09:41.391\nthat's gonna be our fill color.\n\n219\n00:09:41.391 --> 00:09:43.367\nSeveral different ways to change this.\n\n220\n00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:46.307\nAgain, just kind of the method that's\njust easiest that I like the best\n\n221\n00:09:46.307 --> 00:09:47.777\nto kind of go ahead and get started or\n\n222\n00:09:47.777 --> 00:09:50.676\neven just as I'm generally working\nis just to using this control bar.\n\n223\n00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:54.871\nSo I'm gonnasingle click on this box and\nyou can see, okay,\n\n224\n00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:56.689\nI can change that to blue.\n\n225\n00:09:56.689 --> 00:09:59.883\nI can click on the stroke color,\nI can make that pink.\n\n226\n00:09:59.883 --> 00:10:03.955\nWhatever you wanna do, you have\nthe option to change these colors.\n\n227\n00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:06.005\nThat's just kinda one starting method.\n\n228\n00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:08.020\nI like this because they're separated.\n\n229\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.186\nSo, I have my fill on my one side and\nmy stroke on the other.\n\n230\n00:10:11.186 --> 00:10:13.969\nYou could also change these\nin your swatches panel.\n\n231\n00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:17.953\nSo we're gonna kinda move to the right\nside of our workspace over here, and\n\n232\n00:10:17.953 --> 00:10:19.479\nI can see my swatches panel.\n\n233\n00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:22.155\nYour swatches panel,\nyou don't have it already,\n\n234\n00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.156\njust remember go to your Window menu.\n\n235\n00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:28.623\nAnd go down to I believe it's just\ncalled swatches, it's just right there.\n\n236\n00:10:28.623 --> 00:10:31.197\nAnd you can go ahead and grab it,\nit looks like a bunch of boxes,\n\n237\n00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.618\nbasically what the icon is there.\n\n238\n00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:34.796\nAnd you can see I have the option here.\n\n239\n00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:37.697\nNow, what you're looking at,\nyou're probably going, okay,\n\n240\n00:10:37.697 --> 00:10:39.340\nI'm only changing the fill color.\n\n241\n00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.395\nWhy am I not changing the stroke color?\n\n242\n00:10:41.395 --> 00:10:45.107\nThis, to be honest, kinda the reason why\nI prefer to do it in my options bar in\n\n243\n00:10:45.107 --> 00:10:48.246\nthat top left-hand corner,\nas opposed to the swatches panel.\n\n244\n00:10:48.246 --> 00:10:52.144\nAnd that's because it gets kinda\nthis weird kind of flippery,\n\n245\n00:10:52.144 --> 00:10:54.653\nthat's a nice word, isn't it, yeah.\n\n246\n00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:56.857\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I know where you're going and\n\n247\n00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:58.477\nI'm like,\nthat's a perfect way to describe it.\n\n248\n00:10:58.477 --> 00:11:00.011\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n249\n00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:01.486\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it's all about that corner.\n\n250\n00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:03.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's in a really small spot, and\n\n251\n00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.450\nwhere it's flippery,\n[INAUDIBLE] over each other.\n\n252\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, exactly,\neh, it's just kinda weird.\n\n253\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.870\nSo not my favorite thing,\nbut it does work and\n\n254\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.030\nsometimes, depending on\nthe situation you might need it.\n\n255\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.410\nSo basically, what we're looking at here,\n\n256\n00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.550\nyou're looking at the top left-hand corner\nof that swatches panel specifically.\n\n257\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.753\nSo in that panel, I see the red on top or\nI maybe make that yellow, so\n\n258\n00:11:23.753 --> 00:11:26.115\nthere's more of a color distinction.\n\n259\n00:11:26.115 --> 00:11:30.211\nThat yellow on top and then I see that\nkind of pink outline underneath it,\n\n260\n00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:31.699\nthat's my stroke color.\n\n261\n00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:36.401\nSo what I wanna do to be able to change my\nstroke color, I need to move that on top.\n\n262\n00:11:36.401 --> 00:11:40.425\nSo if I select the pink,\njust go ahead and click on the pink,\n\n263\n00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:44.385\nnow that one's on top and\nnow I can change my stroke color.\n\n264\n00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:47.908\nSo my stroke is very small right now,\nso you may not necessarily be seeing.\n\n265\n00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:49.805\nI can even kinda zoom in a little bit.\n\n266\n00:11:49.805 --> 00:11:52.650\nYou may not necessarily be\nseeing the color change,\n\n267\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.220\nbut it is indeed changing color.\n\n268\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.004\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes when you have something\nselected with the blue that we have right\n\n269\n00:11:58.004 --> 00:12:00.885\nnow, that'll change later when\nwe get into layers again.\n\n270\n00:12:00.885 --> 00:12:01.437\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Again,\n\n271\n00:12:01.437 --> 00:12:02.620\nforeshadowing, don't\nworry about it right now.\n\n272\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.819\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:12:03.819 --> 00:12:05.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sometimes is misleading\n\n274\n00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.925\nbecause I chose it to be black,\nwhy is not showing up?\n\n275\n00:12:08.925 --> 00:12:12.398\nIt's because it's such a small stroke,\nso sometimes we click off of it,\n\n276\n00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:16.165\ndeselect it, there's the actual stroke\ndoing what it's supposed to do.\n\n277\n00:12:16.165 --> 00:12:16.844\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n278\n00:12:16.844 --> 00:12:19.120\n&gt;&gt; And then you go back,\nselect it and change it some more.\n\n279\n00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.229\nSo don't let that be a little\nmisleading cuz it can be.\n\n280\n00:12:22.229 --> 00:12:26.217\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a really good point\nbecause the path outline, like you said,\n\n281\n00:12:26.217 --> 00:12:30.732\npretty much everything's gonna be blue for\nnow at least when you select something.\n\n282\n00:12:30.732 --> 00:12:32.545\nBut yeah,\nyou almost have to kinda do select,\n\n283\n00:12:32.545 --> 00:12:36.200\njust click off somewhere else to really\nbe able to tell, okay, what's that color.\n\n284\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.300\nBut you kinda led me into a good segue.\n\n285\n00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.470\nHow do I make that stroke bigger,\nif I wanted to see it?\n\n286\n00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.621\nSo, right now we're starting\noff with a one-point stroke.\n\n287\n00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:47.708\nWhat I can do, again, many different\nways to skin a cat in Illustrator.\n\n288\n00:12:47.708 --> 00:12:50.898\nBut we're gonna start off with my\npersonal favorite, which again,\n\n289\n00:12:50.898 --> 00:12:52.770\nis just to go back into that control bar.\n\n290\n00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.755\nSo I'm gonna click on, or actually, no.\n\n291\n00:12:55.755 --> 00:12:59.462\nWe'll start here, we see our fill and\nour stroke color, the yellow and the blue.\n\n292\n00:12:59.462 --> 00:13:03.572\nAnd then I'm gonna go kinda just one step\nover to where I have that stroke, and\n\n293\n00:13:03.572 --> 00:13:06.367\nthen you'll see right next to it,\nI have one point.\n\n294\n00:13:06.367 --> 00:13:09.630\nSo that one point is referring\nto my stroke weight.\n\n295\n00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.440\nSo basically right now,\nI have it set pretty small,\n\n296\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.980\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n297\n00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.443\nCertainly, for demonstration purposes,\nit's pretty small.\n\n298\n00:13:16.443 --> 00:13:20.266\nI can either click on the dropdown menu\non the right-hand side of that, or\n\n299\n00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.190\njust click on the up and down arrows.\n\n300\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.968\nOr if I wanted to get really crazy,\nI could double-click in here and\n\n301\n00:13:24.968 --> 00:13:25.714\ntype something.\n\n302\n00:13:25.714 --> 00:13:28.881\nBut for right now, I'm just gonna\nclick on that dropdown menu.\n\n303\n00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:32.733\nAnd maybe I'll make that a six point or\nI didn't have anything selected, yes.\n\n304\n00:13:32.733 --> 00:13:35.267\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was letting you go.\n\n305\n00:13:35.267 --> 00:13:37.898\nI'm like,\nI wonder if she's doing this on purpose.\n\n306\n00:13:37.898 --> 00:13:40.209\nHey, but you need this select to effect.\n\n307\n00:13:40.209 --> 00:13:42.463\nGotta have it selected first.\n\n308\n00:13:42.463 --> 00:13:44.552\n&gt;&gt; I like that little\nselect to effect demeanor.\n\n309\n00:13:44.552 --> 00:13:46.205\n&gt;&gt; You can use that one too.\n\n310\n00:13:46.205 --> 00:13:47.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm gonna steal that.\n\n311\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.670\nSo yeah, so in my case, I didn't have\nanything selected, so nothing changed.\n\n312\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.670\nIt's just like, okay, cool,\nsix points on nothing, great.\n\n313\n00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.930\nBut what I do now, I go ahead and\nselect that with my black arrow tool.\n\n314\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:13:59.720\nAnd I can go ahead and\n\n315\n00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.790\nmake that six points, and you'll see\nthat's obviously much larger now.\n\n316\n00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.100\nNow, with our stroke, again,\n\n317\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.750\nthere are several different\nthings you can do in Illustrator.\n\n318\n00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.335\nSo I have some additional\noptions with this stroke.\n\n319\n00:14:10.335 --> 00:14:14.243\nWhat I can do, pretty much anytime\nyou look in your control bar and\n\n320\n00:14:14.243 --> 00:14:18.366\nyou see something that has kind of\na dotted underline underneath it,\n\n321\n00:14:18.366 --> 00:14:21.871\nyou're gonna see you have\nthe option to kind of open it up.\n\n322\n00:14:21.871 --> 00:14:25.460\nIt kinda opens up like a little\nmini panel, if you will.\n\n323\n00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.310\nSo, if I click on that word stroke,\nbecause it has that dotted underline,\n\n324\n00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.140\nyou'll see I have all these different\noptions that I can pull up.\n\n325\n00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.635\nMy cap,\ncap you're not really gonna see here.\n\n326\n00:14:34.635 --> 00:14:36.095\nI can change it just to show you, but\n\n327\n00:14:36.095 --> 00:14:38.595\nyou're not really gonna see\nany difference on this square.\n\n328\n00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:40.490\nYou'll see it more on our open paths.\n\n329\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.740\nCorner, you'll see.\n\n330\n00:14:43.105 --> 00:14:46.800\nIt's very subtle, but\nmy corner kinda rounded there.\n\n331\n00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.300\nBefore, it was just that straight edge,\nso you can change that.\n\n332\n00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.570\nYou can change where your strokes aligns.\n\n333\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.360\nSo by default, your stroke will\nalign kinda halfway between\n\n334\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.100\nthe inside of the shame and\nhalfway between the outside of the shape.\n\n335\n00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.238\nIf I wanted to, I could set it to a line\nall of the inside, all to the outside,\n\n336\n00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:05.549\nwhatever you wanna do.\n\n337\n00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:07.262\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of a big one for me,\n\n338\n00:15:07.262 --> 00:15:11.275\nespecially if you're doing things that\nyou need to be pinpoint accurate.\n\n339\n00:15:11.275 --> 00:15:12.897\nOr you want a stroke, but\n\n340\n00:15:12.897 --> 00:15:17.800\nthat box can only three inches wide\nin a printed version or whatever.\n\n341\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.230\nAnd that drove me crazy.\n\n342\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.883\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; For the longest time, but\n\n343\n00:15:20.883 --> 00:15:23.258\nthe stroke's kinda half out, half in.\n\n344\n00:15:23.258 --> 00:15:25.444\nSo just put it all the way to the inside,\n\n345\n00:15:25.444 --> 00:15:29.303\nthat means the square will be exactly\nthree inches or whatever it is.\n\n346\n00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:33.426\nSo just a little FYI on that one,\nit's a huge deal for me.\n\n347\n00:15:33.426 --> 00:15:35.529\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] it's important, yeah.\n\n348\n00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:36.380\nWe all have our things.\n\n349\n00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That, yeah, I totally agree, and\n\n350\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.104\nthat's something that's really important.\n\n351\n00:15:40.104 --> 00:15:43.868\nIt does change the size of your shape,\nso by having something kinda hanging off\n\n352\n00:15:43.868 --> 00:15:47.192\nthe side, it's gonna change that\nthree by five or whatever you had.\n\n353\n00:15:47.192 --> 00:15:51.813\nSo if you do want it be specifically,\nmake sure to align that all to the inside,\n\n354\n00:15:51.813 --> 00:15:53.920\nwhich would be that middle option.\n\n355\n00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.470\nIf it doesn't, it doesn't matter,\nso unless you need a specific size,\n\n356\n00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.400\nthen go with that.\n\n357\n00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.457\nYou can also add a dashed line, so I can\njust click on that dashed line option and\n\n358\n00:16:03.457 --> 00:16:05.416\nyou can see kinda what happens there.\n\n359\n00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:07.880\nAll right, now I'm gonna just\nzoom out a little bit, so\n\n360\n00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.150\nyou can see a little bit better here,\nand kinda move off to the side.\n\n361\n00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.520\nBut, you can change the size of that dash.\n\n362\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.420\nIf I want the dash\nitself to be six points,\n\n363\n00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.118\nI want the gap between them to be three,\nI don't know.\n\n364\n00:16:21.118 --> 00:16:24.750\nYou can kinda make it up, and then, you\ncan even have kind of an uneven pattern.\n\n365\n00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.250\nSo, I could change that to like two and\n\n366\n00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.410\nthen one and you can kinda go on and\ncreate something as fancy as you want to.\n\n367\n00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.990\nSo, and that certainly just gonna\ndepend on what you're doing.\n\n368\n00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.800\nYou could also add arrow heads, I think\nthat's a little bit better to see in\n\n369\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.080\nan open path but\nis an option that you have.\n\n370\n00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.210\nWe have these stroke width profiles, we're\ngonna talk about that in a different day.\n\n371\n00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.650\nBut if you wanna go ahead and\nkind of explore it, go crazy.\n\n372\n00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.340\nSo with that, I've kind of\nmentioned open paths a little bit.\n\n373\n00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.370\nRight now, we've been really starting\nspecifically with just closed paths.\n\n374\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.390\nBut we'll go ahead and just kinda get\nstarted a little bit on those open paths,\n\n375\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.200\nbecause they do work well with our stroke.\n\n376\n00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.180\nSo it'll kinda illustrate\nthat a little bit.\n\n377\n00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.810\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndelete this little guy here.\n\n378\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.990\nIn my open paths, my open paths,\na lot of things in my line segment tool.\n\n379\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.730\nSo, again, my line segment tool has\nsome things kinda hidden underneath it.\n\n380\n00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.416\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\nstart with the basic line segment.\n\n381\n00:17:14.416 --> 00:17:18.327\nSo it's just gonna be kinda caddy cornered\non my tool bar from that rectangle tool.\n\n382\n00:17:18.327 --> 00:17:21.793\nYou can also hit kind of a backward slash\non your keyboard if you wanna go ahead and\n\n383\n00:17:21.793 --> 00:17:23.120\ngrab that.\n\n384\n00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.380\nAnd what you do,\npretty much just a click, hold and drag.\n\n385\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.370\nYou could also, I believe,\nif I remember correctly,\n\n386\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:31.550\njust single click, if you had\na specific dimension and single angle.\n\n387\n00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:36.600\nSo it's just gonna be exactly the same as\nour two options for creating a square.\n\n388\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.207\nLikewise, with that, you're gonna\nhave those keyboard shortcut options.\n\n389\n00:17:40.207 --> 00:17:43.275\nSo if I wanted to make one that\nwas perfectly straight across,\n\n390\n00:17:43.275 --> 00:17:45.281\nI can go ahead and hold down my Shift key.\n\n391\n00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:49.449\nIf I wanted to create one from the center\nout, hold down my Alt key, and\n\n392\n00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:54.480\nyou'll see it'll create from the center\nout, rather than from the left hand side.\n\n393\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.070\nAnd, that was Alt or Option,\ndepending on if you're in Mac or PC.\n\n394\n00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.382\nAnd, likewise, again,\nif I wanted to be really fancy and\n\n395\n00:18:01.382 --> 00:18:03.949\ndo both, hold down my Alt key or\nmy Shift key or\n\n396\n00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:08.705\nI'm sorry hold them together and you can\ncreate a perfect line from the center out.\n\n397\n00:18:08.705 --> 00:18:15.289\nAnd so, see what you'll notice with this\nis that this is all using my stroke.\n\n398\n00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:19.610\nSo our open paths are not gonna use\na fill color, cuz they're not filled in.\n\n399\n00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.990\nSo they're all using those\nstroke colors that I set.\n\n400\n00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.490\nSo again, you can kinda go through here,\n\n401\n00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.880\nI can change my stroke color,\nI can change my stroke options.\n\n402\n00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.440\nI'm gonna take off this dash line,\n\n403\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.740\njust cuz I think it'll show\nit a little bit better.\n\n404\n00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.410\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nshow you that Round Cap.\n\n405\n00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.700\nYou see how that kinda rounds it off\na little bit, you can see also, I believe,\n\n406\n00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.800\nProjecting Cap is the other\noption that you have.\n\n407\n00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.490\nAnd you can kinda see\nhow that's gonna change.\n\n408\n00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.870\nNow, you're not gonna see the alignment or\n\n409\n00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.970\nthe corner as much with this one\nas you are with a closed path.\n\n410\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.597\nBut, you will see it in your open ones.\n\n411\n00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:54.936\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and way when you first started,\nthat it was blue and dash,\n\n412\n00:18:54.936 --> 00:18:58.480\nthat was because it's kind of\nremembering like the format you used.\n\n413\n00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.128\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna always do that if you're\n\n414\n00:19:00.128 --> 00:19:01.540\nstarting off with a blank document.\n\n415\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.197\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, thank you for\npointing that out, yeah,\n\n416\n00:19:03.197 --> 00:19:04.613\nyou're not always gonna\nget a blue dash line.\n\n417\n00:19:04.613 --> 00:19:06.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be fun, every time,\n\n418\n00:19:06.605 --> 00:19:07.790\nblue dash line.\n\n419\n00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.808\nNo it'll pretty much just start off\nwith whatever settings that you had\n\n420\n00:19:10.808 --> 00:19:11.469\nthe last time.\n\n421\n00:19:11.469 --> 00:19:13.936\n&gt;&gt; And\nanother thing that has tripped me up,\n\n422\n00:19:13.936 --> 00:19:18.235\nlike if I don't have anything selected and\neverything is clicked off and\n\n423\n00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:21.915\nI start changing stuff up in\nthe control panel or up at the top.\n\n424\n00:19:21.915 --> 00:19:27.245\nThen that becomes like the default setting\nfor the next thing that you draw and\n\n425\n00:19:27.245 --> 00:19:32.830\nit kind of, I'm like why does it keep on\ngoing black or why is it always being red.\n\n426\n00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:37.728\nDeselect everything, change everything\nback up at the top to where you want it to\n\n427\n00:19:37.728 --> 00:19:41.130\nstart as the new default,\nand then it goes from there.\n\n428\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.210\nSo that's just trial and error of\nthings that I've learned of like it'll\n\n429\n00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.193\ndrive you crazy until you\nrealize what you did.\n\n430\n00:19:47.193 --> 00:19:48.204\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n431\n00:19:48.204 --> 00:19:50.410\nthat has driven me nuts several times.\n\n432\n00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.600\nSo yeah, I'm glad you pointed that out,\nyeah, just always make sure to,\n\n433\n00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.740\nif I have nothing selected, and I go here,\nand change whatever, these colors.\n\n434\n00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.860\nThe next time I go to do something, I'm\ngonna be like, why is that pink and blue.\n\n435\n00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And, it will drive you nuts.\n\n436\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.300\nBut I think that was pretty much it for,\nas far as getting started,\n\n437\n00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.200\nfor our closed paths and our open paths.\n\n438\n00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.610\nSo, yeah, just kinda play around and have\nfun and again, remember you can really\n\n439\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.750\ncreate so many things,\nwith just that basic, basic material.\n\n440\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.620\nAnd again anything we did\nwith our closed paths,\n\n441\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.780\nsame thing is gonna apply to circles.\n\n442\n00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.620\nI'm trying to click down on some paper\nhere, so it's not wanting to be my friend.\n\n443\n00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.680\nCircles, polygons, stars,\nanything like that, so\n\n444\n00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.700\nthat's all gonna apply to the same thing.\n\n445\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.220\n&gt;&gt; Awesome,\nwell I mean that's a great way to start.\n\n446\n00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.890\nWe've done our circles and our squares,\n\n447\n00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.120\nI feel like we've maybe\ngraduated kindergarten.\n\n448\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.347\n[LAUGH] And now we're gonna move on\nto first grade and second grade and\n\n449\n00:20:45.347 --> 00:20:48.700\ndo a lot more advanced things, but\nit's always a good place to start.\n\n450\n00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.410\nAnd this is also a good place to end, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap this up.\n\n451\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.110\nSigning off for CreativeProTV I've\nbeen your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n452\n00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n453\n00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.903\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n454\n00:20:57.903

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I like that,\nI like that.\n\n14\n00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:43.006\nNow, this is actually, it's really fun,\nit's still our basic shapes and\n\n15\n00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:43.690\nformatting.\n\n16\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.762\nBut this is actually one of the tricks\nthat we're going to start off with with\n\n17\n00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:49.175\nour basic shapes is one of my\nfavorite things to talk about.\n\n18\n00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.022\nAnd I don't know,\nI just think it's so exciting.\n\n19\n00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:53.330\n&gt;&gt; It's the star tool, isn't it?\n\n20\n00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah!\n&gt;&gt; I know, yay!\n\n21\n00:00:53.898 --> 00:00:55.148\n&gt;&gt; She's like, I know it's coming,\nI know it's coming. &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:55.658\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, so\n\n23\n00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:58.006\nwe're going to start off\nwith those basic shapes, and\n\n24\n00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.260\nkind of expanding upon\nthat a little bit more.\n\n25\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.833\nBut then we're going to get a little\nbit more into those open paths.\n\n26\n00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:07.001\nSo you guys may have noticed that there\nare some hidden things under our line\n\n27\n00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:07.870\nsegment tool.\n\n28\n00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.773\nAnd we're gonna kind of expand\nupon those a little bit more.\n\n29\n00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:14.180\nSo what we're gonna do, we're gonna start\noff with the star tool, the exciting one.\n\n30\n00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.767\nNow that I've kind of gotten\nall the hype up about it.\n\n31\n00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:20.619\n[LAUGH] And the first thing that we need\nto do, you'll see I have no fill and\n\n32\n00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.700\nno stroke applied here.\n\n33\n00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.716\nI could do this with no fill and\nno stroke, but what's gonna happen is,\n\n34\n00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:26.991\nI'm not gonna see anything.\n\n35\n00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:31.624\nSo what I wanna do is I wanna go ahead and\njust find a fill color, it doesn't matter,\n\n36\n00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:34.623\nor if you want to get crazy,\nyou can do a stroke color.\n\n37\n00:01:34.623 --> 00:01:37.067\nI'm just gonna make it orange,\nand then, like I said,\n\n38\n00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:38.950\nwe're gonna start off with our star tool.\n\n39\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.798\nSo we're gonna go ahead and just click and\nhold on that rectangle tool.\n\n40\n00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:46.027\nAnd, again, you can let go, we remembered\nthat little handy trick there.\n\n41\n00:01:46.027 --> 00:01:46.932\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:48.605\n&gt;&gt; Click and hold on our rectangle tool,\n\n43\n00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:50.810\nand then our star tool is\nhidden underneath that.\n\n44\n00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.588\nIt's just above that forbidden\nflair tool that we talked about.\n\n45\n00:01:53.588 --> 00:01:56.744\nSo, I'm going to grab that star tool,\nand then, of course,\n\n46\n00:01:56.744 --> 00:01:58.160\nit just works the same way.\n\n47\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.709\nWe can either click hold and\ndrag, single click,\n\n48\n00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.148\nyou can do whatever you\nwant to create the star.\n\n49\n00:02:03.148 --> 00:02:06.089\nBut, where it gets really\nexciting is when we add\n\n50\n00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:08.570\nin our keyboard shortcuts with this.\n\n51\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.486\nSo, what we can do, say we have\na typical five-point star to begin with.\n\n52\n00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:16.400\nBut what if you want something with all\nkinds of crazy little points on it?\n\n53\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.617\nFun thing, what we can do, as I am click,\nhold, drag, creating my star,\n\n54\n00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:23.830\nI can use a couple keyboard shortcuts.\n\n55\n00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.760\nSo similar to the way that we held down\nthe shift key to create a perfect square.\n\n56\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.197\nWe're now going to use, we're going\nto move over on our keyboard, and\n\n57\n00:02:31.197 --> 00:02:32.704\nuse the up and down arrow keys.\n\n58\n00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:35.603\nIf I, while I'm creating my star.\n\n59\n00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:36.594\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou're still holding the mouse right now?\n\n60\n00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:37.719\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You do not let go.\n\n61\n00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's essential, I'm still\nholding down my mouse, thank you.\n\n62\n00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.842\nI am going to hold my up arrow key,\nor click my up arrow key, and\n\n63\n00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:49.124\nyou can see I can add my star.\n\n64\n00:02:49.124 --> 00:02:50.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n65\n00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:52.744\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whenever I teach this to people,\n\n66\n00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:53.284\nthey're like!\n\n67\n00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:53.877\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n68\n00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:56.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think this is the moment where people\n\n69\n00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:58.777\nkind of see how fun Illustrator can be,\n\n70\n00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:01.600\ncuz it really is just\na really fun program.\n\n71\n00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.566\nAnd this is kind of where it's that\nbreakthrough moment, it's like, my gosh,\n\n72\n00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.790\nlook at all the cool things we can do,\nso yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.480\n&gt;&gt; But yet, there's more, aren't there?\n\n74\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.657\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, there's so\n\n75\n00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:13.260\nmuch more, yeah.\n\n76\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.992\nSo I'll do that again,\njust so you can kind of see.\n\n77\n00:03:14.992 --> 00:03:19.783\nI know sometimes it's a little bit wonky\nto get used to holding down your mouse,\n\n78\n00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:22.440\nbut also clicking things on your keyboard.\n\n79\n00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.067\nI think that's kind of one of the just\nkind of learning curves when you're\n\n80\n00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:27.363\nworking in Illustrator.\n\n81\n00:03:27.363 --> 00:03:29.936\nEspecially Illustrator, but\nother Adobe programs as well.\n\n82\n00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:32.325\nSo what I'm going to do,\nI'm going to start off the same way.\n\n83\n00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:35.637\nNow you'll notice, when I click,\nhold and drag again,\n\n84\n00:03:35.637 --> 00:03:38.190\nI'm not going back to\nthat five point star.\n\n85\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.030\nIllustrator is going to keep those\nsettings that we had before, so\n\n86\n00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.663\nI don't know how many points this is.\n\n87\n00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:46.612\nI'm not going to count, but you can see\nit kind of kept their same setting.\n\n88\n00:03:46.612 --> 00:03:51.451\nSo, again, click, hold, drag, still\nholding down my mouse, I'd show you, but\n\n89\n00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:53.240\nI just can't lift up that far.\n\n90\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.337\nAnd so what I'm gonna do now,\nI'm gonna use my down arrow key,\n\n91\n00:03:56.337 --> 00:03:59.230\nwhile I'm still holding down my mouse.\n\n92\n00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.737\nAnd I can see I can kinda get back\ndown to that original five point star.\n\n93\n00:04:02.737 --> 00:04:07.193\nSo it is important to remember that\nthese settings are going to keep, so\n\n94\n00:04:07.193 --> 00:04:10.335\nif I do something like this,\nand then go in later.\n\n95\n00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:13.356\nWay later, an hour so from now,\ncontinue to work, and\n\n96\n00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:17.181\nthen I'm gonna be like, why am I\ngetting all these points on my star?\n\n97\n00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:20.110\nIt's because Illustrator is\ngoing to remember that, so,\n\n98\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.640\nthat's one important thing.\n\n99\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.672\nAnd again, make sure that you're\nstill holding down your mouse while\n\n100\n00:04:25.672 --> 00:04:28.004\nyou are using that up and down arrow key.\n\n101\n00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:31.839\nThere's another method for doing this,\nif that's not working for you, and\n\n102\n00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.670\nwe'll talk about that in a second.\n\n103\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.752\nSo, what I'm gonna do now, though, so\n\n104\n00:04:36.752 --> 00:04:42.207\nyou'll see right now all of the kind\nof points are creating it the same.\n\n105\n00:04:42.207 --> 00:04:46.773\nTechnically, the radius is the correct\nterm here, I like to call them legs,\n\n106\n00:04:46.773 --> 00:04:49.950\nbecause that's basically\nwhat they look like to me.\n\n107\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.024\nThey're all kind of\ncreating at the same point,\n\n108\n00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:54.054\nwhat if I wanted to extend\nthose out really far?\n\n109\n00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:57.108\nSo you get kind of like a-\n&gt;&gt; Long legged star.\n\n110\n00:04:57.108 --> 00:04:58.505\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, yeah.\n\n111\n00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:02.501\nI'm thinking of a children's book with\na little starry night or something, yeah.\n\n112\n00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.973\n&gt;&gt; Or the first or, long legged star.\n\n113\n00:05:04.973 --> 00:05:06.815\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, long legged star.\n\n114\n00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:09.417\nSo if you want a long legged star,\nor a short legged star,\n\n115\n00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:12.690\nif you want a short star, what you can do,\nit's gonna be very similar.\n\n116\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.280\nI'm gonna click, hold and\ndrag to create a new star.\n\n117\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.868\nBut this time I'm gonna hold down my\nCommand or CTRL key on my keyboard, so\n\n118\n00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:21.801\nCommand on a Mac, CTRL on a PC.\n\n119\n00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:24.734\nIf I hold that down, again, same method,\n\n120\n00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:28.570\nI'm holding down my mouse\nright now as I'm using this.\n\n121\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.090\nAnd then I'm just kinda\nslowly dragging out.\n\n122\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.800\nAnd you don't wanna go crazy,\nI mean, you could, that works.\n\n123\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.786\nBut if you just kinda slowly drag in and\nout, what you'll see is that I can make\n\n124\n00:05:39.786 --> 00:05:42.277\nthat long-legged star-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:05:42.277 --> 00:05:44.372\n&gt;&gt; That I was looking at, and likewise,\n\n126\n00:05:44.372 --> 00:05:46.120\nthis setting is gonna keep.\n\n127\n00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.642\nBut if I click, hold, and drag, and\nthen hold down my Command or CTRL key and\n\n128\n00:05:49.642 --> 00:05:52.140\ndrag in,\nI can make something that's a lot smaller.\n\n129\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.574\nThat looks more like a ribbon banner.\n\n130\n00:05:56.574 --> 00:05:58.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like the little star.\n\n131\n00:05:58.385 --> 00:05:58.916\n&gt;&gt; Like an award.\n\n132\n00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:01.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and\n\n133\n00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:05.110\nyou see those in a PowerPoint,\nor what have you.\n\n134\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.609\nI think they have to call them banners or\naward thingies, thingies,\n\n135\n00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:13.348\nthat's exactly what they called them,\nbut I know them.\n\n136\n00:06:13.348 --> 00:06:15.121\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you, yes,\n\n137\n00:06:15.121 --> 00:06:17.179\nthat's exactly what I was going for,\nso yeah, so\n\n138\n00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:18.800\nthat's another option that you have.\n\n139\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.906\nSo your two keyboard shortcuts, it's going\nto be while you're holding down the mouse,\n\n140\n00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:23.848\nthat is essential.\n\n141\n00:06:23.848 --> 00:06:27.719\nUsing your up and\ndown arrow key to add points to your star,\n\n142\n00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.035\nor using your Command or CTRL key.\n\n143\n00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:33.098\nCommand on a Mac, CTRL on a PC,\nto extend the legs.\n\n144\n00:06:33.098 --> 00:06:38.300\nOr technically the radius, if we wanna\nget really technical here, of that star.\n\n145\n00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.987\n&gt;&gt; And I think that you could also do like\nan alt in there that does some weird thing\n\n146\n00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:43.983\nto where it kinda goes inward or outward.\n\n147\n00:06:43.983 --> 00:06:48.120\nBut there was something that I always\nwould do, cuz people would go ahead.\n\n148\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.748\nAnd they'd make a whole bunch of\npoints and super long-legged stars.\n\n149\n00:06:52.748 --> 00:06:58.340\nAnd then they'd go back like,\nI have no idea how to even reset it.\n\n150\n00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.497\nSo I'm like, well, if you just kinda go\nback and redo what you did, they're like,\n\n151\n00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:02.257\nI don't remember.\n\n152\n00:07:02.257 --> 00:07:04.770\nSo a little kind of key point that I know.\n\n153\n00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.814\nIf you click with the star tool,\n\n154\n00:07:06.814 --> 00:07:11.837\nthis is kinda just like a rule of thumb to\nkinda get back to as basic as you could.\n\n155\n00:07:11.837 --> 00:07:13.725\nSo, if you don't mind,\ngo ahead and click there.\n\n156\n00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:14.849\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And just make the star and\n\n157\n00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:16.810\nthen bring up the dialogue\nbox that comes up.\n\n158\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.689\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just single click.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n159\n00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In that radius one, radius two,\n\n160\n00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:23.290\nyou do one as a whole, one as a half.\n\n161\n00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.789\nSo if you did four, two, and five,\nthat's, anything to kind of,\n\n162\n00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:34.784\nor two, one, and five, or one, one and\na half, five, you get the idea.\n\n163\n00:07:34.784 --> 00:07:41.680\nThat would take you back to the most basic\nfive pointed star that you can get to.\n\n164\n00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.208\nAnd I think, if I remember correctly,\nif you do the star tool from now on,\n\n165\n00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:48.336\nit should remember that setting.\n\n166\n00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:52.903\nSo if you kinda need a reset,\nthat's the easy, yeah, see,\n\n167\n00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:55.731\nnow it's kind of like-\n&gt;&gt; My legs are little wonky.\n\n168\n00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:56.512\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little wide.\n\n169\n00:07:56.512 --> 00:07:57.503\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's there.\n\n170\n00:07:57.503 --> 00:08:01.679\n&gt;&gt; But then you can go ahead and\nhave a nice starting point to go back and\n\n171\n00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:04.820\ndo a control to make it\nlonger The points to go up.\n\n172\n00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.016\nSo that was just something that I\nalways found to be a little helpful\n\n173\n00:08:08.016 --> 00:08:08.823\nas a nice reset.\n\n174\n00:08:08.823 --> 00:08:09.746\n&gt;&gt; That is very helpful, yes.\n\n175\n00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:12.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I, yeah, I was actually going to\n\n176\n00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:16.100\nexplain, okay, grab your star tool,\nsingle-click to reset.\n\n177\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.648\nWhat I did not know was the whole and\nthe half, so that's handy.\n\n178\n00:08:20.648 --> 00:08:26.110\nYes, cuz people always ask me to [LAUGH],\njust add in some numbers.\n\n179\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.160\nYeah, you can use that radius one, radius\ntwo, and then the points, obviously.\n\n180\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.286\n&gt;&gt; Half whatever radius one is,\nthat will get you back to normal.\n\n181\n00:08:33.286 --> 00:08:33.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, fabulous,\n\n182\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.320\nyou think you're not gonna do math\nwhen you jump into Illustrator.\n\n183\n00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.570\nAnd then here you go, you're doing it\nall day long, so, yeah, fantastic tool.\n\n184\n00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.560\nAnd again, if for some reason,\nI know on occasion,\n\n185\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.790\nI'll come across people who just,\nkeyboard shortcuts don't work for them.\n\n186\n00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.420\nThey can't get the up and down arrow, some\nof them have issues with it not working.\n\n187\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.910\nYou can always go back to that method\nagain, just grabbing your Star Tool,\n\n188\n00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.620\nsingle clicking, and\nthen kind of going on from there.\n\n189\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.050\nSo that was just kind of our fun\nback to our close pass a little bit.\n\n190\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.260\nBut now I'm gonna go back into some\nmore of those line segment tools.\n\n191\n00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.940\nSo we've talked about\nour line segment tools,\n\n192\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.180\njust kind of the basic,\nhow does it work method.\n\n193\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.010\nWhat we have not talked about\nare those tools hidden underneath it.\n\n194\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.750\nSo I'm gonna click and\nhold on my line segment tool, and\n\n195\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.530\nwe are going to start\noff with our Arc Tool.\n\n196\n00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.870\nOur Arc Tool, as the name implies,\nis going to create arcs.\n\n197\n00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.880\nSo from this simple method,\nwhat we can do is we can kinda click,\n\n198\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.700\nhold, and drag and create an arc.\n\n199\n00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.830\nBut because this is an open path,\n\n200\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.720\nyou'll see right now, all I have is a fill\ncolor, I don't have a stroke color chosen.\n\n201\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.250\nSo open paths are always gonna\nuse that stroke color, so\n\n202\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.660\nmake sure that you go back and\nselect that.\n\n203\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.830\nSo I'm gonna grab here,\n\n204\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:47.230\nI'm gonna change that fill color to none,\nwhich is just gonna be my red slash.\n\n205\n00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.220\nAnd then I'm just gonna kind of\nrandomly pick a stroke color.\n\n206\n00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.336\nNow, again, for my Arc Tool,\nall I have to do is click, hold, and\n\n207\n00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:55.410\ndrag to create an arc.\n\n208\n00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.123\nNow, mine, because I was showing\nVonne something before the show,\n\n209\n00:09:59.123 --> 00:10:01.180\nit's closing in that arc by default.\n\n210\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.010\nBut what yours probably looks like, and\n\n211\n00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.450\nI'll kind of go back and\nexplain this here in a second.\n\n212\n00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.160\nYours probably looks\nsomething more like that,\n\n213\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.740\nthat is what you would typically\nsee when you would create an arc.\n\n214\n00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.996\nAnd again, you can use any of those\nstroke options that we've talked about.\n\n215\n00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:18.640\nSo I can make this stroke\na little bit wider, anything,\n\n216\n00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.570\nI could dash it if I wanted to.\n\n217\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:26.230\nBut that's pretty much just the basics of\nour Arc Tool, so you grab it, click, hold,\n\n218\n00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.184\nand drag, and then you will be\nable to create an arc there.\n\n219\n00:10:29.184 --> 00:10:34.150\nNow, keyboard shortcuts again, with this,\nwhat I can do, I can click, hold,\n\n220\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.980\nand drag, hold down my up arrow key.\n\n221\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.851\nAnd what you'll see,\nit's still gonna be an arc,\n\n222\n00:10:39.851 --> 00:10:42.430\nyou'll never gonna get a perfectly\nstraight line out of our Arc Tool.\n\n223\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.079\nBut what I can do is, I can create\nsomething little looks a little bit more\n\n224\n00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:47.190\nlike a 90 degree angle when I do that.\n\n225\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.340\nThat's just by holding\ndown my up arrow key,\n\n226\n00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.050\nsame method that I used when\nI was creating that star.\n\n227\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.900\n&gt;&gt; I call this the bendiness.\n\n228\n00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n229\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.650\n&gt;&gt; How much the arc is gonna bend,\nso technical term.\n\n230\n00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.860\n&gt;&gt; I think that's perfect, yes,\nthe bendiness of the arc will change, so\n\n231\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.110\nI'm gonna click, hold, and drag again.\n\n232\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.646\nYou'll see it's gonna, again,\nkeep those same settings,\n\n233\n00:11:06.646 --> 00:11:08.611\nthat's just kind of\na thing with Illustrator.\n\n234\n00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:10.443\nAnd now I'm going to hit\nmy down arrow key, see,\n\n235\n00:11:10.443 --> 00:11:13.310\nnow you can get something that's-\n&gt;&gt; And you can go the other way,\n\n236\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.920\nright, if you keep it down,\nit'll bend the other direction?\n\n237\n00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.070\n&gt;&gt; See, it'll kinda flip over that way,\nso that's kind of fun too.\n\n238\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:25.100\nNow, if the up and down arrow key,\nnot your friend, what we can do is kinda\n\n239\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:30.150\nwith our Star Tool, same thing, I can\ngrab my Arc Tool and just single-click.\n\n240\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.590\nNot like I just did, I kinda clicked and\ndragged a little bit, so\n\n241\n00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.420\nthat kinda pretended to create an arc.\n\n242\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:41.060\nBut if I just single click, [CROSSTALK]\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] build up the suspense.\n\n243\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.140\nIf I single-click, what I can do is,\nI can choose some of these settings.\n\n244\n00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.640\nSo I could change the x axis,\nthe y axis, and then what you'll notice,\n\n245\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.980\nwhat I was kinda playing around with\nthe beginning there was the type.\n\n246\n00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:59.460\nSo by default, this is gonna create\nan open arc, kinda what you see there.\n\n247\n00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.910\nI could, if I wanted to,\ncreate a closed arc,\n\n248\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.260\nso that's gonna kinda fill everything in,\nwhich is nice.\n\n249\n00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.620\nSo if you wanna change this\ntype from open to closed, and\n\n250\n00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.555\nthen even if you wanted to,\nyou could add fill.\n\n251\n00:12:12.555 --> 00:12:17.100\nI'll start off without it, but\nyou can go ahead and hit OK.\n\n252\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.650\nMaybe I'll delete all of these other guys,\nso it's not distracting.\n\n253\n00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.540\nAnd what I can do is I can\ncreate that closed arc.\n\n254\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.630\nAnd I believe, yes,\n\n255\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.420\nyour keyboard shortcuts would\nstill work with this as well.\n\n256\n00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.576\nSo I'm still using my up and\ndown arrow key,\n\n257\n00:12:30.576 --> 00:12:34.090\njust in the same way that I was before,\nbut it's kinda closing that in.\n\n258\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.670\n&gt;&gt; And\nI have no idea when they started this.\n\n259\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.150\n[LAUGH] Cuz when you showed me that,\nI'm like, when did they do that?\n\n260\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:45.890\nCuz that was not an option back when I\nwas using it, I mean, a couple years ago.\n\n261\n00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.700\nLike, frequently as I was using it,\nI actually use it here and there, but\n\n262\n00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.220\nI never even knew this was an option.\n\n263\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.707\nSo that's where, when she was showing me,\nI was like, this is awesome [LAUGH].\n\n264\n00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.418\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's the little things, right?\n\n265\n00:12:56.418 --> 00:12:57.454\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the little things,\n\n266\n00:12:57.454 --> 00:12:59.453\ncuz occasionally you'll just\nhit a moment where you're like,\n\n267\n00:12:59.453 --> 00:13:00.573\nI need a shape that looks like this.\n\n268\n00:13:00.573 --> 00:13:04.440\nAnd you naturally kinda use harder\nmethods, I think, by default.\n\n269\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little foreshadowing,\nI would go ahead and make a square, and\n\n270\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.920\nthen make a circle, and then do the path\nfinder, and then kinda like cut it out.\n\n271\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.660\nAnd it's like wait, I can just make it now\nfrom the regular line tool type thing,\n\n272\n00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.820\ngood job, Illustrator, [LAUGH].\n\n273\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it makes your life so\nmuch easier in the long run.\n\n274\n00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.520\nSo it's really, although it may not seem\nlike it, a great addition to Illustrator.\n\n275\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.750\nAnd again, I could do this,\n\n276\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.020\nI could fill this in,\nit doesn't even have to be a closed arc.\n\n277\n00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.420\nIt still could be open, and you could fill\nit in, which might look a little strange,\n\n278\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.540\nbut depending on what you need,\nworks as well.\n\n279\n00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.327\nSo you can hit OK.\n\n280\n00:13:38.327 --> 00:13:40.172\nI don't have a fill color chosen, but\n\n281\n00:13:40.172 --> 00:13:42.736\nyou could see I could also\nadd a fill color like that.\n\n282\n00:13:42.736 --> 00:13:46.580\nI could have before anyway, but you'll\nsee, it just looks a little bit different.\n\n283\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.167\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like a new shape tool.\n\n284\n00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:50.153\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:52.737\n&gt;&gt; It really is, even though it's in kinda\n\n286\n00:13:52.737 --> 00:13:56.470\nthe open path section,\nwe can make a closed path out of it.\n\n287\n00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:03.450\nSo, that's kind of a nice one, and\nmove on to a fun one, our Spiral Tool.\n\n288\n00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.010\nSo, our Spiral Tool,\nas you can guess, creates spirals.\n\n289\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.897\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:10.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know, it's shocking.\n\n291\n00:14:10.259 --> 00:14:13.840\n&gt;&gt; Some of these names is like okay,\nyeah, pretty descriptive, right?\n\n292\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.510\nSo yeah, it's gonna create spirals.\n\n293\n00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.300\nYou can see, just click,\nhold, and drag, and\n\n294\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.490\nyou can create a fun little\nwhirlydad from there.\n\n295\n00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.520\nOf course, open path, so\nwe're gonna see our stroke, all that.\n\n296\n00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.870\nNow, as you probably guessed,\n\n297\n00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.010\nthere are some keyboard shortcuts\nthat go along with this.\n\n298\n00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.700\nSo what is it, wait for it,\nup and down arrow keys.\n\n299\n00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.930\nI'm going to use my up and\ndown arrow keys to add spirals.\n\n300\n00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:39.345\nNow, a little note with this one,\ndon't go crazy.\n\n301\n00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:44.056\n[LAUGH] The more you add, it will kind\nof just disappear on you, so, yeah.\n\n302\n00:14:44.056 --> 00:14:47.300\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe one I can mention about the star,\n\n303\n00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.810\nyou can kind of set it back to normal.\n\n304\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.661\nWith the spiral, it would be one of those,\nif I had to open up Illustrator,\n\n305\n00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:59.050\nclick once and then write down what\nthe original settings were, and\n\n306\n00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.060\nput it off to the side as a note.\n\n307\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.860\nCuz that's the only way I would remember\nwhat the settings would be to kind of get\n\n308\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:11.710\nyou back to a normal spiral, besides\nclose Illustrator down and start over.\n\n309\n00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:16.900\nSo take note, and yes, it can get\nout of hand very quickly [LAUGH].\n\n310\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.114\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, you definitely want to do\nit with a little bit of discretion,\n\n311\n00:15:20.114 --> 00:15:20.720\nand I agree.\n\n312\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.624\nThat's always my advice to people,\nI'm like, just close the program and\n\n313\n00:15:23.624 --> 00:15:24.140\nstart over.\n\n314\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.938\nWhen in doubt, I would say, just close\nthe program and start over in general.\n\n315\n00:15:26.938 --> 00:15:30.608\nBut especially with the Spiral Tool,\ncuz if you just go crazy,\n\n316\n00:15:30.608 --> 00:15:33.960\nit's just gonna get really wonky on you,\nso just kinda add one at a time.\n\n317\n00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.810\nAgain, I'm just using my up arrow key\nas I'm kinda click, hold, and dragging,\n\n318\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.610\nstill holding down my mouse, still\nmethod that we used from the Star Tool.\n\n319\n00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.820\nI'm just using my up\narrow key to add spirals.\n\n320\n00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.300\nLikewise, I could get rid of\nspirals with my down arrow key.\n\n321\n00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.910\nAnd so yeah, so this is nice,\nyou can add those spirals in.\n\n322\n00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.315\nBut what you're probably noticing is that,\n\n323\n00:15:53.315 --> 00:15:56.325\nit doesn't really change\nthe appearance of my spiral.\n\n324\n00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:59.694\nI mean, you can see some little\nswirls added there in the middle, but\n\n325\n00:15:59.694 --> 00:16:00.808\nNot a big difference.\n\n326\n00:16:00.808 --> 00:16:03.938\nWhere you're gonna, I think,\na bigger difference is in your Command or\n\n327\n00:16:03.938 --> 00:16:04.460\nCTRL keys.\n\n328\n00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.930\nSo we're using our same\nkeyboard shortcuts but\n\n329\n00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.360\nwe're just kinda doing\nthem in different way.\n\n330\n00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.260\nSo I'm gonna click, hold, and drag again.\n\n331\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.440\nI've already added some spirals to this.\n\n332\n00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.120\nNow I'm gonna hold down my Command or\nCTRL key.\n\n333\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:21.690\nAs I do that, very similar to the star\ntool, very subtly drag in and out.\n\n334\n00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.200\nYou don't wanna go crazy.\n\n335\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.460\n&gt;&gt; Little movements.\n\n336\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.361\nSmall movements go a long way\nwhen modifying the spiral tool.\n\n337\n00:16:28.361 --> 00:16:33.349\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, but the cool thing is\nthose little movements can make a pretty\n\n338\n00:16:33.349 --> 00:16:35.510\ndramatic difference, I think.\n\n339\n00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.430\nSo you can get something that\nlooks totally like this.\n\n340\n00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.010\nI can hold down my Command key again.\n\n341\n00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.860\nWhoa, you'll see that went\nway over to the outside.\n\n342\n00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.770\nDepending on how much movement I wanna\nadd, or I can have something that looks\n\n343\n00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.600\nessentially the same as we\nwere starting off with.\n\n344\n00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.260\nSo, kind of nice.\n\n345\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.590\nAnd then again from here,\nonce you settle that, I can say,\n\n346\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.260\nokay, I like where that's at, but\nI wanna add a few more spirals.\n\n347\n00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.966\nHold down your up and down arrow keys,\nor your up arrow key.\n\n348\n00:16:59.966 --> 00:17:03.786\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so mouse hold down, let go\nof the CTRL and then go over to, and\n\n349\n00:17:03.786 --> 00:17:04.772\nthat's like-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n350\n00:17:04.772 --> 00:17:08.591\n&gt;&gt; That's whole kind of remembering almost\nlike the muscle dexterity of keep that\n\n351\n00:17:08.591 --> 00:17:11.270\nhold down, let go of this,\nokay, now move over there.\n\n352\n00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:15.716\nSo it takes a while to get used to but\nmouse down, let go of CTRL, up and\n\n353\n00:17:15.716 --> 00:17:19.580\ndown arrow, then you can go back to CTRL,\nmove up and down.\n\n354\n00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.320\nBut as soon as you let go of the mouse,\n\n355\n00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.730\nthen it completes whatever you\nhave done from that point.\n\n356\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.288\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that is exactly right.\n\n357\n00:17:27.288 --> 00:17:29.137\nAnd it's funny,\nwhen you've been using it for\n\n358\n00:17:29.137 --> 00:17:32.110\na while, it's almost hard to explain\ncuz it's kind of like muscle memory.\n\n359\n00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; At a certain point.\n\n360\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.420\nAnd so you have to kind of think back and\nremember, okay, what exactly am I doing?\n\n361\n00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.570\nBut yes,\nmake sure you kind of let go of one.\n\n362\n00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.403\nHold on, exactly what she said.\n\n363\n00:17:40.403 --> 00:17:44.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you don't get it right,\njust delete that one, just start over.\n\n364\n00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.499\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Whoops, let go too soon,\n\n365\n00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:48.600\nlet's move over some.\n\n366\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, exactly.\n\n367\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:54.245\nAnd like we said, you do have the option\nwith your spiral tool to single-click, and\n\n368\n00:17:54.245 --> 00:17:58.130\nyou can go ahead and add in whatever\ninformation that you want there.\n\n369\n00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.620\nNow, not that intuitive,\nI don't think necessarily to really say,\n\n370\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.058\nokay, I know exactly what\nI want the decay to be.\n\n371\n00:18:04.058 --> 00:18:06.541\nBut it is an option\nthat you have there for\n\n372\n00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:10.580\nyou if you're a little bit more\ninclined in the math department.\n\n373\n00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.544\n&gt;&gt; And the up and down as I call it,\n\n374\n00:18:12.544 --> 00:18:17.089\nthe style where it is the circle going\nthis way, or is it going that way?\n\n375\n00:18:17.089 --> 00:18:19.169\nThose little buttons that are right there.\n\n376\n00:18:19.169 --> 00:18:20.037\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right, yeah.\n\n377\n00:18:20.037 --> 00:18:21.154\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like, okay, well,\n\n378\n00:18:21.154 --> 00:18:21.870\nthat's kinda nice.\n\n379\n00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.550\n&gt;&gt; Up or down?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the style, yeah, yeah.\n\n380\n00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.580\nIt does come in handy.\n\n381\n00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.530\nWith pretty much any tool, you can\npretty much do the single click and\n\n382\n00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.060\nhave some additional options there.\n\n383\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.230\nBut it's just always helpful to know.\n\n384\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.940\nSo we're gonna kind of move down.\n\n385\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:38.390\nWe'll see we have our rectangular\ngrid tool and our polar grid tool.\n\n386\n00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.310\nI may kinda do these in tandem here.\n\n387\n00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.887\nWith our rectangular grid tool,\nwhat we're gonna get?\n\n388\n00:18:43.887 --> 00:18:45.490\nA rectangular grid.\n\n389\n00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.310\nHold down your Shift key if you\nwanna create it a perfect grid.\n\n390\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.720\nPolar grid, it's gonna be kinda of\nthe same thing but in a circle.\n\n391\n00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.900\nHold down my Shift key if\nI want to make it perfect.\n\n392\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.010\nNow why am I doing these at the same time?\n\n393\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:04.150\nWell one, because they're going to use the\nsame keyboard shortcuts that we've done.\n\n394\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:09.120\nSo I can hold down my up and\ndown arrow keys to add boxes.\n\n395\n00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.420\nOr even, this one's gonna introduce\nour right and left arrow keys, so\n\n396\n00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.300\nyou can see it kind of adds more rows or\ncolumns depending on what you're doing.\n\n397\n00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.101\nBut same method, I'm holding down my\nmouse, up arrow key or right arrow key,\n\n398\n00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:22.073\nleft arrow key, whatever you wanna do.\n\n399\n00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:24.640\nSame thing, polar grid tool.\n\n400\n00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.280\nGonna grab that one out.\n\n401\n00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.127\nI'm gonna hold down my up arrow\nkey to add spirals, the right or\n\n402\n00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:33.700\nleft arrow key to add pie slices\nis what I'm gonna call it.\n\n403\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.190\n[LAUGH] That's the mathematical term,\nright?\n\n404\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.490\nSo we can go ahead and add that.\n\n405\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.990\nNow why am I doing these at the same time?\n\n406\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.486\nThey don't really look all that exciting,\nright?\n\n407\n00:19:43.486 --> 00:19:46.193\nSo we're gonna get some spiral tools,\na star,\n\n408\n00:19:46.193 --> 00:19:49.340\nyou can create things that look kinda fun.\n\n409\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.916\nThe thing about these two is that they're\nreally the most helpful once you know\n\n410\n00:19:52.916 --> 00:19:54.878\nsome other advanced Illustrator skills.\n\n411\n00:19:54.878 --> 00:19:57.556\nSo we're gonna get things later,\nlike expanding and\n\n412\n00:19:57.556 --> 00:20:01.560\nall this stuff, where you can actually\nreally use this to your advantage.\n\n413\n00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.876\nYou can create those pie slices and\nthings like that.\n\n414\n00:20:03.876 --> 00:20:08.230\nBut for right now, based on the skills\nwe have, this is the level we're at.\n\n415\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.610\nWhich is still great.\n\n416\n00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.940\nI'm not saying that's bad, but\nthat's kinda of our basis there and\n\n417\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.340\nthen we'll expand on it later.\n\n418\n00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.349\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, anytime I would teach these,\npeople were like, so\n\n419\n00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:18.297\nwhy would you even do this?\n\n420\n00:20:18.297 --> 00:20:21.302\nAnd it's like, well,\nthat comes a little later.\n\n421\n00:20:21.302 --> 00:20:25.468\nIf you think about if I'm\nmaking an infograph and\n\n422\n00:20:25.468 --> 00:20:28.930\nI wanted to have a pie chart or whatever.\n\n423\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.052\nYou could use this to kinda give you\nthree equal parts or four equal parts or\n\n424\n00:20:33.052 --> 00:20:36.720\nyou're designing something that you\nneed things in boxes in a sense.\n\n425\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.387\nYou can use these almost like a grid,\nlike a outline, but\n\n426\n00:20:39.387 --> 00:20:40.840\nthen you can use it to color it.\n\n427\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.014\nThere's a lot of different functionalities\nthat you can have with it besides right\n\n428\n00:20:45.014 --> 00:20:47.710\nnow, it's just kinda like okay,\nthat's all it is.\n\n429\n00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n430\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:49.951\n&gt;&gt; So just remember that for\nlater down the road.\n\n431\n00:20:49.951 --> 00:20:51.232\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n432\n00:20:51.232 --> 00:20:53.232\nit's just not as fun to\nlook at as a spiral.\n\n433\n00:20:53.232 --> 00:20:53.949\n&gt;&gt;

You didn't know that.\n&gt;&gt; I was like, what?\n\n46\n00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:04.492\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What did that just do?\n\n47\n00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:05.110\n&gt;&gt; Lorem ipsum.\n\n48\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I just [CROSSTALK]-\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I like that, honestly.\n\n49\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Are you kidding?\n\n50\n00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.793\nI love it. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I'm a little\ntorn right now, please continue.\n\n51\n00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:15.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You just take a moment to\n\n52\n00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.410\nprocess that.\n\n53\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.955\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:18.872\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's going on?\n\n55\n00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:19.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n56\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.890\nit's funny because it's kinda carried over\nfrom InDesign, a different Adobe program.\n\n57\n00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.450\nAnd so\n\n58\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.660\nit's a little weird to used to cuz it's\ndefinitely a newer thing in Illustrator.\n\n59\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.860\nSo but yes,\nthat is an option to either grab it and\n\n60\n00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.940\nsingle click now you will see that\nthe Lorem ipsum is highlighted so\n\n61\n00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.474\nyou can basically just go ahead and\nstart typing like normal.\n\n62\n00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:38.540\nSo I can type in Emily\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n63\n00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.450\nsee I got a little ahead of my self\nof like, I'm judging right away.\n\n64\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n65\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.260\nJust type.\n\n66\n00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.870\n&gt;&gt; Right, you don't have to go through and\ndelete it.\n\n67\n00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.670\nIt seems weirder than it is,\nbut where it comes in handy is,\n\n68\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.920\nsay I'm working on a logo I've\ngot some shapes or whatever.\n\n69\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.750\nI don't know why for a logo you wouldn't\nknow the name of a company already, but\n\n70\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.620\nif you didn't or you had a tagline\nthat you were trying to add and\n\n71\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.150\nyou just didn't know what it was yet.\n\n72\n00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.800\nBut you needed to go ahead and\nstart laying it out.\n\n73\n00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.970\nThat comes in handy,\nyou can just type in that lorem ipsum,\n\n74\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.770\nthat's what it's there for.\n\n75\n00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.540\nIt's just referred to as placeholder text,\nso you can use that.\n\n76\n00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.760\nSo that was our first option,\nwas just a single click.\n\n77\n00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.530\nOur second option was to click,\nhold, and drag.\n\n78\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.090\nSo when you click, hold, and drag, we're\ngoing to get a lot more type in there.\n\n79\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.806\nSo yeah.\n\n80\n00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:24.900\n[LAUGH] I see Vonne's face just like drop.\n\n81\n00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.020\n&gt;&gt; See, I mean,\nthese are the changes that have happened\n\n82\n00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.630\nfrom whatever version I\nwas using religiously and\n\n83\n00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.240\nnow, into this new version,\nagain it's those little things.\n\n84\n00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.580\nA seasoned user like me,\nit's just like, my God.\n\n85\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.130\n&gt;&gt; RIght.\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n86\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.690\nyou newbies out there, you're like,\nokay, this is just the new norm.\n\n87\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.480\nSo, just know my perspective of\ngoing back for way too many years,\n\n88\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.430\nthat I even want to tell you, of how long\nI've been using the product, but, yeah.\n\n89\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; These newer features,\n\n90\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.510\nthere are some neat little things.\n\n91\n00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.490\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n92\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.860\n&gt;&gt; You're selling on this.\n\n93\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nJust warm up to it.\n\n94\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.060\nI think you'll enjoy it.\n\n95\n00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.970\nSo, very similar to our single click\nmethod, is that I can just go ahead, and\n\n96\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.990\ngo here, and type and\nI can just fill up the maps.\n\n97\n00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.910\n&gt;&gt; Type, type, type away.\n\n98\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.780\n&gt;&gt; Type, type, type, type away.\n\n99\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.510\nYes, exactly, so, the differences\nare gonna come in our editing.\n\n100\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.370\nNow, technically these two methods\nthat we used had two different names.\n\n101\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.380\nSo, this was point type and\nthis was area type.\n\n102\n00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.200\nPoint type is just when you single click.\n\n103\n00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.188\nArea type is when you go ahead and click,\nhold, and drag and create the text box.\n\n104\n00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.030\nArea type as you can guess,\nis gonna be a little bit better for\n\n105\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.200\na longer bits of text.\n\n106\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.580\nThings like a paragraph that\nyou need to put in there.\n\n107\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.610\nYour point type is better for just when\nyou need to be an example of a logo,\n\n108\n00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.400\njust type in the name of a company.\n\n109\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.750\nNow, what you'll see though is when I\nclick on my two different text boxes,\n\n110\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.220\nI'm back in my black arrow tool.\n\n111\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.720\nAlways go back to black.\n\n112\n00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.940\nWhen I click on my two different text\nboxes, you'll see I can drag this\n\n113\n00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.560\narea type in and out, and what's happening\nis that's just going to kind of re\n\n114\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.830\nthread it and re flow it as we\nlook at it in our text box.\n\n115\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.780\nIf I try and do that with my point type,\nwhat's gonna happen is,\n\n116\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.020\nyou're just gonna squish it.\n\n117\n00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.090\nOr even in that case,\nI just kind of made it disappear.\n\n118\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.450\nIt's just gonna squish it there.\n\n119\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.410\nWhich is something you really want\nto avoid from a design perspective\n\n120\n00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.910\nof distorting your typography.\n\n121\n00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.410\nYou never want to distort you\ntext from the original intention.\n\n122\n00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.980\nSo, the thing about it is, you just\nkinda have to know which one you want.\n\n123\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.930\nNow, you don't have\nthe option to do that or\n\n124\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.080\nmove anything around in the point\ntype like you do the area type, but\n\n125\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.570\nwhat you do have the option\nof is making it larger.\n\n126\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.210\nSo, I'm going to hold down my shift\nkey cuz I always wanna maintain those\n\n127\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.190\nproportions.\n\n128\n00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.660\nAnd then just click, hold, and\ndrag in the top right hand corner.\n\n129\n00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.910\nAnd bam I went ahead and\nincreased the size of my type very easily.\n\n130\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.330\nSo rather then having to go through and\nbe like do I want 72 points, what I want.\n\n131\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.410\nI can just click, hold, and\ndrag and make that bigger.\n\n132\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.220\nSo not an option that I had in my area\ntype that's just going to change the size\n\n133\n00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.550\nof my text, but\nI do have that option in my point type.\n\n134\n00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.780\nNow, cool thing.\n\n135\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.540\nYou can go back and forth between the two.\n\n136\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.430\nSo for some reason I had this.\n\n137\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.820\nAnd I decided, you know what,\nI really want this to be point type.\n\n138\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.500\nI don't care if I have to\ndrag that around anymore.\n\n139\n00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.740\nIt's not necessary.\n\n140\n00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.445\nWhat you can do, you'll notice,\nif I click on either one of these.\n\n141\n00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:18.020\nIf I click on my point type\nI have a little white circle\n\n142\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.940\ncoming out the right hand side of that.\n\n143\n00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.800\nBy clicking on my are type I\nhave a little blue circle.\n\n144\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.310\nBasically you can even try to hover\nover to discover if I double click\n\n145\n00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.540\non that circle.\n\n146\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.498\nWhat it gonna do is to convert from\npoint to area or area to point.\n\n147\n00:06:31.498 --> 00:06:34.790\nSo, I can click, hold, and\ndrag this now and make this larger.\n\n148\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.450\nOr likewise I could flip this one around.\n\n149\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.663\n&gt;&gt; That was probably one of my\nfavorite features that they changed.\n\n150\n00:06:41.663 --> 00:06:47.250\nI don't remember when, but I can\nchange this by just a clicking thing.\n\n151\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.220\nThat's amazing.\n\n152\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.280\nYou do stuff like cut it out,\nand start a new text box and\n\n153\n00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.070\nthen drag the box to kind of go back and\nforth.\n\n154\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.360\nThere wasn't a simple click method\nto flip them back and forth so.\n\n155\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.740\nYeah, this was a while back but,\nit was an amazing edition that they added.\n\n156\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; That I was like thank you very much.\n\n157\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes yes.\n\n158\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.580\nBack when we walked uphill in\nthe snow to get to school.\n\n159\n00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.570\nWe also had to copy and paste our text\nto get it into the different kind.\n\n160\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.370\nYes and totally revolutionary.\n\n161\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.450\nAnd again just a simple double click on\nthat little circle on the right hand side\n\n162\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.760\nand it's going to be able to flip\nyou back and forth between the two.\n\n163\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.180\nSo just depending on what your going\nto do it's really just going to make\n\n164\n00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.490\na difference of whether if you want to be\nable to increase that size very easily.\n\n165\n00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.340\nFor just a small bit of text or\nif you do have a larger bit then\n\n166\n00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.340\nmaybe the area type is going\nto work a little better.\n\n167\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.720\nNow In terms of just\na regular text editing.\n\n168\n00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.120\nSo of course we have to have\nthe ability to change the font and\n\n169\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.060\nyou know change the font size in\na normal method, things like that.\n\n170\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.060\nAs we have mentioned before there\nare two different ways to do this or\n\n171\n00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.880\nreally probably more than that but\n\n172\n00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.700\ntwo different kind of basic ways\nthat we are going to start with.\n\n173\n00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.140\nOne, always my favorite go to is just\nusing that control bar in the top.\n\n174\n00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.800\nSo with this, we can either\njust select a whole text box,\n\n175\n00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.465\nas I have right now with my\nblack arrow tool, or if I double\n\n176\n00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:10.510\nclick in to that text box, you'll see\nit'll take you back to your type tool.\n\n177\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.580\nWith this one, if I'm in my type tool,\nI need to be able to highlight text.\n\n178\n00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.240\nTo be able to kind of choose\nwhere it's gonna impact.\n\n179\n00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.140\nSo again either I can select the whole\ntext box and it will change the whole\n\n180\n00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.690\nthing, or if I double click in that text\nbox to get back into my type tool, or\n\n181\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.260\neven if you were just still in your type\ntool from where you were originally typing\n\n182\n00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.926\nthe material, you can go ahead and\nhighlight what you wanna change.\n\n183\n00:08:31.926 --> 00:08:34.290\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nselect this text box as a whole, and\n\n184\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.080\nthen I'm gonna move up\ninto my control bar.\n\n185\n00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.660\nSo, we see here, we have the character and\nparagraph options.\n\n186\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.070\nAs we've mentioned in other lessons,\nwe can go ahead and\n\n187\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.070\njust click on that character option or\nclick on that paragraph option and\n\n188\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.360\nyou will see that there.\n\n189\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.990\nNow, you also have a character and\nparagraph panel.\n\n190\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.510\nWe can go into our window menu and\ngo ahead and grab those.\n\n191\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.190\nThese are kind of I wouldn't say hidden,\nbut they're not necessarily as obvious.\n\n192\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.680\nYou have to go under your Type menu.\n\n193\n00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.660\nSo go to Window, and\nthen all the way down to Type.\n\n194\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.810\nAnd we're gonna see Character.\n\n195\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.360\nWe can go ahead and grab that.\n\n196\n00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.000\nBy default mine one hadn't pulled out\nParagraph, but you could also go to\n\n197\n00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.790\nWindow, Type and then pull up paragraph\nif for some reason that didn't show.\n\n198\n00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:18.320\nNow we're basically gonna be able to do\nthe same things in either option, but\n\n199\n00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.530\nI just wanna show you that there are two\ndifferent locations that we can do this.\n\n200\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.470\nSo of course, we could go ahead and\nchange the font.\n\n201\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.370\nNow, I have a million\nfonts on my computer,\n\n202\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.110\nbecause this is what I do for a living.\n\n203\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.700\nYou probably will not have all\nthese options that I have,\n\n204\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.550\nbut one of the nice things that you\ncan do, you can kinda highlight this.\n\n205\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.710\nI can double click.\n\n206\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.140\nAnd then I can use my up and\n\n207\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.520\ndown arrow keys in Illustrator to be\nable to filter through all these things.\n\n208\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.986\nSo it's really helpful when\nI'm working on something,\n\n209\n00:09:42.986 --> 00:09:47.600\nI'm working on a design of some sort and I\njust don't know what font I wanna use and\n\n210\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.070\nI can go scroll through there.\n\n211\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nCuz you have the thing on\n\n212\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.490\nthe right hand side that says sample.\n\n213\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But it's the word sample it's not\n\n214\n00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.580\nthe text that you have, and\nhow like the Es are gonna look different.,\n\n215\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.440\nor the As, or any of those things.\n\n216\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.930\nSo using the up and down arrow is now,\n\n217\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.540\nbut if you have hundreds of fonts,\nyou're just gonna sit there.\n\n218\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n219\n00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.530\n&gt;&gt; Gosh!\n\n220\n00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.590\n&gt;&gt; It's a blessing and a curse, right?\n\n221\n00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\n\n222\n00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.391\n&gt;&gt; But that was another thing that, too,\n\n223\n00:10:14.391 --> 00:10:17.940\nI don't think existed in earlier\nversions of Illustrator.\n\n224\n00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.150\nIt was in other programs, but it's newer.\n\n225\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.010\nLikewise I could also go here and\nI could go ahead and type something out.\n\n226\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.980\nSo, if I knew I wanted to use Open Sans,\n\n227\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.050\nI could just double click on\nwhere it says mirroring approach.\n\n228\n00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.570\nAt the default, Open Sans and\nwhat you'll see,\n\n229\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.680\nis you also have the different\ntypes of weights.\n\n230\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.812\nBut I'll kinda get into some\nmore advanced typography.\n\n231\n00:10:35.812 --> 00:10:38.378\nBut the way that it works\nis you can say Open Sans or\n\n232\n00:10:38.378 --> 00:10:40.140\nyou would choose Open Sans Bold.\n\n233\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.990\nIt's not like Microsoft Word or something\nlike that where I would say okay,\n\n234\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.410\nI want this and then I'm gonna\nhit the big B to make it bold.\n\n235\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.190\nYou're gonna to need to select\nthe weights a little bit differently.\n\n236\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd we can talk about that later,\n\n237\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.470\nlike you said with font families and\nall these.\n\n238\n00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.000\nThere's a whole thing about\ntypography that I know you and\n\n239\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.600\nI can talk forever about.\n\n240\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n241\n00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:00.965\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n242\n00:11:00.965 --> 00:11:01.976\n&gt;&gt; But for right now, there's no Bs and\n\n243\n00:11:01.976 --> 00:11:02.546\nIs and everything.\n\n244\n00:11:02.546 --> 00:11:05.430\nYou pick the font,\nthere sometimes like below or\n\n245\n00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.157\nit says regular that you can\nsometimes get like a bold or\n\n246\n00:11:08.157 --> 00:11:13.770\nitalic depending on the font that you\nchoose and like the options it has.\n\n247\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.080\nWhether, I'm gonna stop right there\ncuz I'm gonna start throwing on words,\n\n248\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.030\nit's like no we're in the basic right now.\n\n249\n00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.920\nSo we're okay.\n\n250\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.337\n&gt;&gt; It's hard not to get into the weeds,\nyou just kind naturally wanna do it but\n\n251\n00:11:23.337 --> 00:11:24.352\nyes I totally agree.\n\n252\n00:11:24.352 --> 00:11:28.300\nSo that's just gonna be kind of our\nbasic character level formatting, and\n\n253\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.480\nwhat we're gonna see in\nour character panel.\n\n254\n00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.900\nYou'll see something there\nit says the touch type tool,\n\n255\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.860\nwe're gonna talk about\nthe touch type tool later.\n\n256\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.340\nAnd all of those other fancy\nthings we see the V and the A,\n\n257\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.740\nand you're like what is that doing?\n\n258\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.900\nWhat does that mean?\n\n259\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.270\nAll things that we're\ngonna talk about later.\n\n260\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.070\nNow, one thing that I wanted to mention.\n\n261\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.120\nYou may have more or\n\n262\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.470\nless options than what I'm seeing\nin my character panel right now.\n\n263\n00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.020\nThis is one of the things in Illustrator\nthat I wanna go ahead and point out.\n\n264\n00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.560\nThat's probably gonna come up later.\n\n265\n00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.370\nSo I'm In my character panel, and\n\n266\n00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.970\nthen I'm gonna click on those three\nlines in the top right hand corner.\n\n267\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.630\nThis is technically called\nour panel options button.\n\n268\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.727\nIf I go ahead and click on that,\nyou're going to see I have the option,\n\n269\n00:12:02.727 --> 00:12:06.070\nwell I have many things, but\nI first have the option to show options.\n\n270\n00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.750\nThat's basically just letting me know that\nthere's more I can do in my character\n\n271\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.800\npanel than what's really\nbeing shown to me.\n\n272\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.840\nSo sometimes this comes up, it's just\nkind of a confusing thing when people\n\n273\n00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.410\nare looking at my screen and they see\nsomething slightly different in my panel.\n\n274\n00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.350\nThey see a lot more options in\nmy panel than what they have.\n\n275\n00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.440\nAnd often times, it's just a matter of\nclicking that panel options button again.\n\n276\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.260\nTop right hand corner of your panel,\nand choosing the hide or show options.\n\n277\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.830\nSo, again, there are multiple\ndifferent things you can do here.\n\n278\n00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.010\nWe're going to go through many\nof them on a different date.\n\n279\n00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.570\nBut you can see one nice thing you can do.\n\n280\n00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.240\nDo all caps.\n\n281\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.240\nYou can do small caps, things like that,\njust from a basic standpoint.\n\n282\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.680\n&gt;&gt; So there are some buttons that\nyou see and maybe some other\n\n283\n00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.770\nprograms that you might not have\nseen them unless you do the options.\n\n284\n00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.580\nAnd they might now have all the buttons\nthat you think there are, and\n\n285\n00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.140\nagain, depending on what font and\nwhat the options you have for\n\n286\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.230\nthe fonts, you might have other buttons.\n\n287\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.210\nSome might be greyed out,\nsome might not be greyed out, so\n\n288\n00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.650\njust know that it all kind\nof goes back to the font and\n\n289\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.130\nthe things that you can do\nwith that particular one.\n\n290\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great point.\n\n291\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.320\nSo if you get into some of\nthe specialty type faces, you know,\n\n292\n00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.390\nsome crazy script or have one that looks\nlike graffiti that just pulled up,\n\n293\n00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.750\nthat's not gonna give me all the options\nthat a basic Myriad Pro is going to be.\n\n294\n00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.130\nSo, those are the types of things that\nyou're gonna control with your character\n\n295\n00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.260\nlevel formatting and your character panel.\n\n296\n00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.630\nThe font, the font weight,\nthe font size, things like that.\n\n297\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.090\nYou'll see the font size is right\nhere in case you missed it, and\n\n298\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.200\nthen going from small caps to all caps,\nthings like that.\n\n299\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.600\nIt is nice that you do have the button.\n\n300\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.160\nYou don't have to retype something,\nand with your caps\n\n301\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.680\non I did like that especially when I\nwas first getting into Illustrator.\n\n302\n00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.840\nBut we'll move on to our\nparagraph level formatting.\n\n303\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.130\nAnd again just to kinda reiterate this is\nall basically going to be the same things\n\n304\n00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.160\nthat you're going to see in that\ncontrol bar, in Illustrator.\n\n305\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.760\nJust kinda on that top section there,\n\n306\n00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.900\nbut we're just looking at it\nfrom the panel perspective.\n\n307\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're almost like shortcuts.\n\n308\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; With the panel, and\n\n309\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.720\nthey just put it up there so\nit's the same thing,\n\n310\n00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.310\njust depending on which place\nyou're more comfortable on working.\n\n311\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.720\nI know, you have double monitors.\n\n312\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.560\nI know some people that put\nall the panels on one monitor.\n\n313\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.295\n&gt;&gt; Woah, yeah.\n\n314\n00:14:12.295 --> 00:14:13.138\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n315\n00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:16.380\nI've actually tried that and\nI'm like no, it's too far away.\n\n316\n00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n317\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.725\nThat's crazy.\n\n318\n00:14:17.725 --> 00:14:19.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, however you want to do it.\n\n319\n00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.900\nSo just know it is the exact same option.\n\n320\n00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:21.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n321\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.790\nAnd however you want to do it,\nit's just your own personal thing.\n\n322\n00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.175\nYou know, the way even though that\nsounds crazy to me, it's just different.\n\n323\n00:14:28.175 --> 00:14:32.865\nAlthough I'm showing you this now, often\ntimes I will just use that control bar.\n\n324\n00:14:32.865 --> 00:14:37.415\nSo, our paragraph level formatting\nis gonna impact things that will\n\n325\n00:14:37.415 --> 00:14:39.815\nchange the entire text.\n\n326\n00:14:39.815 --> 00:14:43.555\nNaturally this is gonna see where you\nchange from a line left to center,\n\n327\n00:14:43.555 --> 00:14:44.395\nor something like that.\n\n328\n00:14:44.395 --> 00:14:46.635\nSo I can do that, and I can center a line.\n\n329\n00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:50.460\nProbably can't see very well in this one,\nbut if I go back to what was my area type\n\n330\n00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.720\nI can center that and you'll see\na little bit of a difference there.\n\n331\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.030\nThis is some spacing options\nthat we can work with right now.\n\n332\n00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.710\nWe'll kind of talk about those later.\n\n333\n00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.770\nHyphenation is kind of a big one.\n\n334\n00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.520\nYou don't really see it too\nmuch with the Lorem ipsum,\n\n335\n00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.000\nbecause it's not something we're reading,\nright?\n\n336\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.280\nSo you're not really so aware of those\nhyphens, but as you go ahead and\n\n337\n00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.660\nput some actual text in there,\nit's gonna become a little more apparent.\n\n338\n00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.310\nSo, what you can do,\nis you can just turn on that hyphenation.\n\n339\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.320\nTurn it on and off and be able to\nchoose exactly what you want to do.\n\n340\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.160\nSo, really nice,\nkind of from a basic perspective,\n\n341\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.220\neven that you do have\nall of these options.\n\n342\n00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.330\nOnce we get into just most\nof this fun stuff and\n\n343\n00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.610\nsome more advanced type, I think you'll\nsee it kind of expands upon there.\n\n344\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.480\nBut from nothing else, just being able\nto look at those options is pretty cool.\n\n345\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n346\n00:15:37.305 --> 00:15:37.980\n&gt;&gt; And I think that's it.\n\n347\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.530\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n348\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.570\n&gt;&gt; Just basic how to write some text.\n\n349\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.843\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean the biggest thing, the\ntakeaway would be like the point type and\n\n350\n00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:49.314\nthe area type and switching back and forth\nwith them and which one you might want to\n\n351\n00:15:49.314 --> 00:15:53.890\nhave depending on if you have, a headline\ntext and you wanted to kind of size that.\n\n352\n00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Then, use the click and\n\n353\n00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.060\npoint method, or, like you said, paragraph\nand changing around all the basic ones.\n\n354\n00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.480\nAnd while, we didn't go over every single\nbutton in there, just play around with it.\n\n355\n00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.640\nWhat does that do?\n\n356\n00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.300\nWhat does that do?\n\n357\n00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.630\nThat's the best way that you're\ngonna learn how to use this product,\n\n358\n00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.125\nis just get in there and\njust click, click, click away.\n\n359\n00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:14.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Always, type, type, type and click,\n\n360\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.021\nclick, click, yeah.\n\n361\n00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:15.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love it, yes.\n\n362\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.640\nWords to live by.\n\n363\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.770\nAll right, we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this Basic Text.\n\n364\n00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.310\nSo signing off for Creative ProTV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n365\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.210\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n366\n00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.826\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n367\n00:16:27.826 --> 00:16:36.209\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\nexciting episode of CreativeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:17.564\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:21.990\nwe are continuing on with our\nIllustrator CC 2017 series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.179\nAnd today we're gonna be talking\nabout swatches, all about colors,\n\n7\n00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.531\nI love me some colors.\n\n8\n00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:30.160\nAnd here to talk about this is Mrs.\nEmily Ramsey.\n\n9\n00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.080\nHello, how are you?\n\n10\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.870\n&gt;&gt; Hello, good, I'm glad to back.\n\n11\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.342\nI'm glad to finally be adding some\nmore colors to things, right?\n\n12\n00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:39.806\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Give it a little splash of\n\n13\n00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:40.760\ncolors.\n\n14\n00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so basically, what we've been\ndealing with up to this point is you've\n\n15\n00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.438\nbeen working with the same\nten colors thus far.\n\n16\n00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:52.320\nAnd so, these are great and I actually\nfind Illustrator's default colors to be\n\n17\n00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.660\nslightly better than other programs.\n\n18\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.141\nSo, not that bad but I'm assuming you\nprobably at some point wanna go ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.900\nstart creating your own and\nadding some more colors in there.\n\n20\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.250\nSo obviously, these are not the only\noptions that you're stuck with.\n\n21\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.147\nSo what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna show\nyou kinda some basic methods for\n\n22\n00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:09.395\ncreating color.\n\n23\n00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:13.091\nKind of a lot of things in Illustrator\nthat are just a million different ways you\n\n24\n00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:13.710\ncan do this.\n\n25\n00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.538\nSo, I'm gonna show\na couple simple methods.\n\n26\n00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:19.920\nAnd then I'm gonna show you a couple of my\nfavorite color tools that kinda go along\n\n27\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.070\nwith that,\nthat really get you started in colors.\n\n28\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.700\nSo, again,\njust kind of a basic discussion on it.\n\n29\n00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.520\nSo we'll go ahead and\nget started in our Swatches panel.\n\n30\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.202\nSo our Swatches panel, of course,\n\n31\n00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:32.250\nis gonna be where you house all\nthe information on swatches.\n\n32\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.262\nSo, what we're gonna do,\nwe have our kind of basic ones,\n\n33\n00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:38.717\nmaybe I'll click this blue or\nwhatever, and what I wanna choose.\n\n34\n00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:41.304\nBut, basically, anytime that you\nwanna create a new swatch, or\n\n35\n00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:44.288\nreally this is actually pretty common\nacross most things in Illustrator.\n\n36\n00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:45.987\nIf I wanna create a new something,\n\n37\n00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:48.989\nI'm gonna click on this little\npost-it note icon, right?\n\n38\n00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:50.310\nI mean, it kind of makes sense.\n\n39\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.625\nIt goes along with what you would think.\n\n40\n00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:56.018\nSo just second from the right, I guess,\non the bottom of the Swatches panel,\n\n41\n00:01:56.018 --> 00:01:58.340\nwe have that little post-it note icon.\n\n42\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.436\nSo when I go ahead and click on that,\nit's gonna pull up this dialog box.\n\n43\n00:02:02.436 --> 00:02:04.040\nI used that blue as an example just so\n\n44\n00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.630\nthat it would give use some c olor to work\noff of, but you can really do anything.\n\n45\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.400\nSo you can go ahead and\ngive your swatch a name if you wanted to.\n\n46\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.175\nRight now, mine's just gonna be named\nwith the color value, so C is set in 100.\n\n47\n00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:18.040\nThat's cyan as 100, and\nI'll explain that in a second.\n\n48\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.740\nFor color type, right now,\njust go ahead and leave it at process.\n\n49\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.990\nWe haven't discussed what all that means.\n\n50\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.066\nAnd it's complicated and\nwe'll talk about that later.\n\n51\n00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:29.903\nSo in color mode right now, I'm just\ngonna go ahead and stick with CMYK.\n\n52\n00:02:29.903 --> 00:02:34.053\nCMYK works great for\nsomething that I'm doing for print.\n\n53\n00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.588\nIf you were doing something for\nthe web, maybe go ahead and\n\n54\n00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:37.791\njust switch it over to RGB.\n\n55\n00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:40.464\nYou can just click on that\nlittle dropdown menu there.\n\n56\n00:02:40.464 --> 00:02:45.368\nSo, CMYK for print, RGB for web,\nis typically what we would recommend.\n\n57\n00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:49.661\nSo here we have, with that CMYK,\nI have cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.\n\n58\n00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:51.566\nThat K stands for black.\n\n59\n00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.740\nThe way I kinda look at this is if you're\nchanging your home office printer,\n\n60\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.840\nhow you get those little\ndifferent printer cartridges?\n\n61\n00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.480\nYou get the cyan, magenta,\nyellow, and the black cartridge.\n\n62\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.330\nThat's basically what\nwe're looking at here.\n\n63\n00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.370\nI mean, this is obviously a much\nfancier method and all that,\n\n64\n00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.060\nbut it's kinda the same thing.\n\n65\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.652\nSo right now,\nyou can see I have that cyan,\n\n66\n00:03:09.652 --> 00:03:12.616\nwhich is basically just blue, set at 100%.\n\n67\n00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:14.626\nMagenta, if I go ahead and bump that up,\n\n68\n00:03:14.626 --> 00:03:19.340\nyou see I'm gonna get something that adds\na little bit more of a kinda purple to it.\n\n69\n00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.190\nThe yellow, if you go ahead and bump\nthat up, you see it becomes more green.\n\n70\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.760\nBlack obviously is going to make\nsomething a little bit darker.\n\n71\n00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.705\nSo with this method, honestly, I don't\nthink it's the best method for just kind\n\n72\n00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:35.306\nof creating a color swatch off the bat and\njust kinda deciding what you want.\n\n73\n00:03:35.306 --> 00:03:39.062\nBut, you can just kinda drag around,\nsee what happens as you move.\n\n74\n00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:40.347\nAnd it's also really great for\n\n75\n00:03:40.347 --> 00:03:43.123\nwhen you know color codes that you\nwanna go ahead and enter in here.\n\n76\n00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:47.049\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and staying in the CMYK\ncolor mode is probably easier for\n\n77\n00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.641\npeople that maybe have no idea about,\nwhat does it mean between the RGB and\n\n78\n00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.190\nCMYK and tint, tones, and HSB.\n\n79\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.239\nAgain, hand wave here,\ndon't worry about that.\n\n80\n00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.808\nBut, it's kind of back\nto kindergarten again.\n\n81\n00:03:59.808 --> 00:04:00.554\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n82\n00:04:00.554 --> 00:04:05.007\n&gt;&gt; Yellow, and blue make green, or\nblue and yellow, wait, no, yeah,\n\n83\n00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:06.549\nyellow, and, I said.\n\n84\n00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.902\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, you got it, you got it.\n\n85\n00:04:08.902 --> 00:04:11.117\n&gt;&gt; And then red and blue make purple.\n\n86\n00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:15.566\nSo that kinda whole thing that we\nlearned back in the day of how colorss\n\n87\n00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:18.090\ninteract with each other.\n\n88\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.451\nIt works along the same line.\n\n89\n00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:23.491\nIf you switch it to RGB, then it kind\nof flips in your brain, gets added,\n\n90\n00:04:23.491 --> 00:04:24.300\nsubtracted.\n\n91\n00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.440\nAgain, I'm trying rowing out\na lot of stuff that you're like,\n\n92\n00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.150\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n93\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.870\nDon't worry.\nLike I said, slide it one way,\n\n94\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.820\nslide it the other,\nfind whatever color you like.\n\n95\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.200\nAnd then, just go with it,\n\n96\n00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.820\nbecause we're just here to create\nthe color that we're seeing.\n\n97\n00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.892\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Not translating into what we need to\n\n98\n00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:45.310\nwork with it and whether it's print or\nweb, what comes with it.\n\n99\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.\n\n100\n00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.813\nNot something you really need\nto worry about right now.\n\n101\n00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:52.677\nI mentioned it cuz it's here, but for\nright now, I definitely agree with Vonne.\n\n102\n00:04:52.677 --> 00:04:56.073\nStick with the CMYK, cuz it's kinda\nthe easiest sliders to work with.\n\n103\n00:04:56.073 --> 00:04:59.300\nSo, and all of that, also,\nis adjustable later.\n\n104\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.830\nSo if you need to change it later,\nwe can do that too.\n\n105\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.659\nSo for right now, just kinda slide\naround and see what you like.\n\n106\n00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.265\nObviously, if you wanna\nincrease the yellow,\n\n107\n00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:08.010\nif you want something more yellow,\ngo that way.\n\n108\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.483\nGo with what you know the ways\ncolors combine and things like that.\n\n109\n00:05:11.483 --> 00:05:12.867\nI also mentioned it's great for\n\n110\n00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:15.180\nif you know the color values\nthat you wanna work with.\n\n111\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.370\nSo a lot of times,\ncompanies, in particular,\n\n112\n00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.450\nwill have certain color values and\ncolor codes that they know stand for\n\n113\n00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.920\nthe particular orange that they use,\nfor example.\n\n114\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.090\nSo you could also go ahead and\ntype that in.\n\n115\n00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.986\nSo if I knew the color values here,\nI could go ahead and type that in.\n\n116\n00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:33.466\nAnd when you're done, obviously,\njust go ahead and hit OK.\n\n117\n00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.990\nAnd you're gonna be able\nto add that swatch.\n\n118\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.952\nYou see mine added right\nnext to that blue,\n\n119\n00:05:36.952 --> 00:05:39.362\nbecause that was the last\nthing that I had selected.\n\n120\n00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:42.960\nNow that's gonna be kind of\nyour basic method for doing it.\n\n121\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.640\nWhat you can also do in Illustrator is you\ncan kinda find some colors that you like,\n\n122\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.850\nand then use that little post-it note\nicon if you will to go ahead and\n\n123\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.010\ncreate a new swatch out of it.\n\n124\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.600\nSo what I can do now,\nI'm gonna go into my toolbar.\n\n125\n00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.520\nIf you go into your toolbar,\n\n126\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.300\nyou'll always see your colors\nreflected on this bottom section here.\n\n127\n00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.913\nSo you're gonna see your Fill color and\nyour Stroke color.\n\n128\n00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:04.418\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndouble-click on this Fill color, and\n\n129\n00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:06.391\nit's gonna pull up this Color Picker for\nme.\n\n130\n00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:10.349\nNow again, there's a lot about this color\npicker that we're gonna explain later,\n\n131\n00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.203\na lot of kinda cool and\ninteresting things you can do with it.\n\n132\n00:06:13.203 --> 00:06:16.067\n&gt;&gt; And this is also if you're\nfamiliar with Photoshop,\n\n133\n00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:18.002\nthat's where you go to pick your colors.\n\n134\n00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:19.455\nI just use swatches in Photoshop too.\n\n135\n00:06:19.455 --> 00:06:22.290\nBut I think that way of going\nover to the left-hand side, and\n\n136\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.150\nthe toolbars are more\nof a Photoshop thing.\n\n137\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.016\nI rarely go to that in Illustrator.\n\n138\n00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:28.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; For some reason, I just,\n\n139\n00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:31.550\nI have always gone over to the panels,\nand some other ways around it.\n\n140\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.915\nSo if you're familiar with other Adobe\nproducts that might be like, well,\n\n141\n00:06:34.915 --> 00:06:36.280\nwhy didn't we go over that.\n\n142\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.560\nYou can do that, so it's just-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n143\n00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.157\n&gt;&gt; Same ways, there's 15 different ways\nto get to the same place in all of\n\n144\n00:06:41.157 --> 00:06:41.808\nthese programs.\n\n145\n00:06:41.808 --> 00:06:44.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, I totally agree.\n\n146\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.960\nAnd I do agree with you, it is a little\nbit more of a Photoshop kind of style.\n\n147\n00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.340\nI use it sometimes for other things.\n\n148\n00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.520\nBut basically, with this method, what\nyou're gonna do is you're gonna drag up\n\n149\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.680\nand down to get kind of the idea\nof a color that you want.\n\n150\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.154\nYou want something that's a little more\nred, you're gonna go to the top pinkish,\n\n151\n00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:03.194\nwhatever, and then, of course,\njust drag within that to find a color.\n\n152\n00:07:03.194 --> 00:07:05.700\nAnd then, once you're done, we'll kind\nof ignore everything else for right now.\n\n153\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.473\nOnce you're done, go ahead and hit OK.\n\n154\n00:07:07.473 --> 00:07:10.995\nNow you'll see with this method,\nit doesn't create a swatch for you.\n\n155\n00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:15.410\nIt just chooses the color for you, And\nthen now, we need to create the swatch.\n\n156\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.063\nSo what we're gonna do, now that I have\nthis kinda of color that I'm working with,\n\n157\n00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:20.432\nit's pinkishy, if you will.\n\n158\n00:07:20.432 --> 00:07:22.637\nYou can see that's reflected\nin my fill color, but\n\n159\n00:07:22.637 --> 00:07:24.700\nnow I need to go back to\nthat post-it note icon.\n\n160\n00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.792\nSo I'm gonna click on\nthat post-it note icon.\n\n161\n00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:29.846\nAnd what you're gonna see is it's already\nfilled in all those color values for me,\n\n162\n00:07:29.846 --> 00:07:31.557\ncuz that's the last color\nI was working with.\n\n163\n00:07:31.557 --> 00:07:34.313\nSo, I can go ahead and just feel like,\nyeah, that looks good,\n\n164\n00:07:34.313 --> 00:07:35.360\nand go ahead and hit OK.\n\n165\n00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.886\nSo, basically, this method is almost\nlike a larger version, if you will,\n\n166\n00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:41.955\nof looking at those CMYK sliders.\n\n167\n00:07:41.955 --> 00:07:45.409\nIt's just slightly different, and it's\na little bit of a two-step process, but\n\n168\n00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:46.310\nit can come in handy.\n\n169\n00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.366\n&gt;&gt; And actually, I was just fine since\nwe're working all these programs, right?\n\n170\n00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:51.469\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We work in Photoshop, Illustrator,\n\n171\n00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:52.563\nInDesign, all these.\n\n172\n00:07:52.563 --> 00:07:55.987\nThere's actually now Add to swatches.\n\n173\n00:07:55.987 --> 00:07:56.587\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Is there?\n\n174\n00:07:56.587 --> 00:07:58.613\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWhich there is in other programs.\n\n175\n00:07:58.613 --> 00:07:59.787\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a little bit confusing.\n\n176\n00:07:59.787 --> 00:08:00.420\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n177\n00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.420\nSo if you're looking at that where it\nhad like, okay canceling color swatches,\n\n178\n00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.060\nthat's not add to swatches\nlike I think Photoshop does?\n\n179\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.230\n&gt;&gt; I think InDesign has it.\n\n180\n00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.810\n&gt;&gt; InDesign.\n\n181\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n182\n00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:11.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n183\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.704\nAnd so, it's a little bit\n\n184\n00:08:12.704 --> 00:08:14.658\nconfusing because I'm\naccustomed to both to be like,\n\n185\n00:08:14.658 --> 00:08:16.010\nwait that button's not there.\nYeah.\n\n186\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n187\n00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.589\nAnd that's where I was doing that kind of\n\n188\n00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:22.210\nmental check also of like, nope.\nNope, Illustrator doesn't have this one.\n\n189\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n190\n00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.210\nit's just working between\nthe programs which is great,\n\n191\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.438\nthey all have their benefits,\nsometimes gonna have this at all.\n\n192\n00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:29.044\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:08:29.044 --> 00:08:30.646\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've also been working at\n\n194\n00:08:30.646 --> 00:08:31.692\nInDesign, lately.\n\n195\n00:08:31.692 --> 00:08:34.620\nSo I I think that's where my brain\nis like, what's going on here?\n\n196\n00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's happening?\n\n197\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.320\nWhat's happening?\n\n198\n00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.590\nNow but Illustrator actually is\none of my favorite programs for\n\n199\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.640\nworking with color,\npartially because this is a good segue\n\n200\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.210\nof the panel options that\nyou have in illustrator.\n\n201\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.490\nSo one of my absolute favorite things\nin Illustrator is working with\n\n202\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.240\nthe color guide panel.\n\n203\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.300\nSo what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna go ahead and grab that.\n\n204\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.530\nIt basically just looks like, you know\nif you go to Home Depot or whatever and\n\n205\n00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.020\nyou get those color swatches in\nkind of like a rainbow booklet?\n\n206\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.970\nThat's basically what the icon looks like.\n\n207\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.410\nIf you don't have it,\nof course always go to your Window menu.\n\n208\n00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.350\nGo to Window.\n\n209\n00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.430\nGo ahead and grab, Color Guide,\nand you can get that there.\n\n210\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.150\nI'm also gonna pull up just\nsome rectangles here just so\n\n211\n00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.670\nwe can kind of see what\nwe're working with.\n\n212\n00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.555\nI'll just draw a couple.\n\n213\n00:09:16.578 --> 00:09:19.172\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I love the Color Guide, too.\n\n214\n00:09:19.172 --> 00:09:23.509\nIt's seriously one of my favorites, like\nworking, like you said, working with color\n\n215\n00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:27.885\nin Illustrator, like better than any of\nthe other Adobe products, in my mind.\n\n216\n00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:29.510\n&gt;&gt; I totally agree.\n\n217\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.050\nI often talk about that with InDesign.\n\n218\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.830\nInDesign, not my favourite,\nIllustrator is great.\n\n219\n00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.978\nSo what we can do with the Color Guide?\n\n220\n00:09:35.978 --> 00:09:39.510\nThe Color Guide's the most awesome for\nwhen you have a color that you like and\n\n221\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.460\nyou're just looking for\nsome other colors to go with it.\n\n222\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.520\nSo let's say I really liked\nthis color that I chose but\n\n223\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.570\nI need some kinda accent colors or\nwhatever.\n\n224\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.517\nSo when we look at our color guide panel,\nwe can see.\n\n225\n00:09:50.517 --> 00:09:52.450\nOkay, right where that top middle is,\n\n226\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.800\nthat's the color that\nI'm working with here.\n\n227\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.480\nThat's my base color.\n\n228\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.310\nAnd what's Illustrator's during is\nit's creating a color palettes for\n\n229\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.410\nme, based off of those other colors.\n\n230\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.090\nSo kinda the cool thing is you\ncould look at this and be yeah,\n\n231\n00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.780\nthat's not really that exciting,\nEmily, it's only a couple of colors.\n\n232\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.540\nWell, here's the thing, if you click on\nthis drop down menu, you'll see that there\n\n233\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.735\nare a ton of various different color\npalettes that you can choose from.\n\n234\n00:10:15.735 --> 00:10:18.945\nSo I think that one was tetrad three.\n\n235\n00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:21.705\nThis is all based on color theory, and\n\n236\n00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:25.365\nthings we don't need to get into now\nabout why they choose it like this.\n\n237\n00:10:25.365 --> 00:10:26.642\nBut you could say, okay.\n\n238\n00:10:26.642 --> 00:10:29.182\nMaybe I want something that's\na little bit more monochromatic,\n\n239\n00:10:29.182 --> 00:10:33.812\nI could pick one of those options and you\ncan go ahead, and just start applying it.\n\n240\n00:10:33.812 --> 00:10:35.792\nMaybe I'll pick an example that's\na little bit more different.\n\n241\n00:10:35.792 --> 00:10:40.142\nYou can go ahead and start applying it\nto the objects that you wanna work with.\n\n242\n00:10:40.142 --> 00:10:43.062\nNow, the other kind of\ncool thing about this is,\n\n243\n00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:45.382\nsay that I'm working with this and\nI'm like, okay,\n\n244\n00:10:45.382 --> 00:10:49.210\nkind of cool that have these color options\nbut what if I decide, you know what.\n\n245\n00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.620\nI like this blue better.\n\n246\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.160\nI want this blue color to be my base.\n\n247\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.510\nI want to go ahead and set that.\n\n248\n00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.510\nSo, what I can do,\nif I wanna change the base color,\n\n249\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:03.770\nwhat we're gonna work with is this top,\nleft hand option in our color guide panel.\n\n250\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.480\nSo, we can go ahead and\njust click on that.\n\n251\n00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.000\nYou'll even see, when you hover over it,\nIt says click to set as base color or\n\n252\n00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.860\nsomething to that effect.\n\n253\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.120\nI can go ahead and set,\nclick to set that as my base color and\n\n254\n00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.370\nthen now all of our color\npalettes are based off of that.\n\n255\n00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.880\nSo then I can be like, okay, you know,\nmaybe I want that to be my accent color,\n\n256\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.140\nmaybe I want yellow in there,\nsomething like that.\n\n257\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you can see especially now\nthat we've changed it that when you do\n\n258\n00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.220\nthat drop down,\nthe blue is that first one,\n\n259\n00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.494\nit kinda has a like\na little box around it.\n\n260\n00:11:30.494 --> 00:11:31.045\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n261\n00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:34.653\nSo that's where it's basing all of\nthese different color combinations and\n\n262\n00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:37.980\nagain this is my favorite part,\nit's like it kinda thinks for us.\n\n263\n00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's like I don't know\n\n264\n00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.485\nwhat colors look good together\n&gt;&gt; They can just tell me, perfect.\n\n265\n00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:45.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, if you're feeling super lazy,\n\n266\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.724\nthis is the way to do it.\n\n267\n00:11:46.724 --> 00:11:49.832\n[LAUGH] And yeah,\nyou're exactly right you can always see,\n\n268\n00:11:49.832 --> 00:11:52.877\nit's always the left hand side\noption is the one that has,\n\n269\n00:11:52.877 --> 00:11:56.069\nyou know, the one that you're\nsetting your base off of too.\n\n270\n00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:59.042\n&gt;&gt; And I thought being efficient.\n\n271\n00:11:59.042 --> 00:12:00.179\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not my easiest,\n\n272\n00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:03.510\nwhy do the work that's already,\nyou know, why reinvent the wheel?\n\n273\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.182\nSo here, there you go.\n\n274\n00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:05.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n275\n00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:07.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Much better terminology, thank you.\n\n276\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.040\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, yes.\nEfficiency.\n\n277\n00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.210\nI love it.\n\n278\n00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.156\nSo what you can do with these\nif you say okay, you know what?\n\n279\n00:12:13.156 --> 00:12:15.752\nI really like this entire thing,\nI wanna go ahead and\n\n280\n00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:18.120\njust create swatches out of all of these.\n\n281\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.640\nWhat you can do is you can save this\nentire color group to your swatches panel.\n\n282\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.850\nSo, I can go ahead and\n\n283\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.430\nclick on this button on the bottom\nright-hand corner where it says,\n\n284\n00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.270\nsave a color group to swatches panel,\nclick on that you really like.\n\n285\n00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.700\nDidn't see anything happen, but the magic\nall happened in your swatches panel.\n\n286\n00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.190\nWell, of course, I did it wrong and\nit only just saved one.\n\n287\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.410\nBut, in theory, I have that pink selected,\nso it only saved the pink.\n\n288\n00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.820\nBut when you have nothing selected,\n\n289\n00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.670\nthen go ahead and\nsave color group to swatches panel.\n\n290\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.577\nThen you're going to see\nyou have all of them there.\n\n291\n00:12:50.577 --> 00:12:53.700\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you how\nmany times I've done that.\n\n292\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n293\n00:12:54.215 --> 00:12:58.045\n&gt;&gt; The other thing I've done is where I\nkeep clicking the button like nothing\n\n294\n00:12:58.045 --> 00:13:00.925\nhappened so if nothing happens,\nwhat do you do?\n\n295\n00:13:00.925 --> 00:13:02.650\nYou click, click and click again.\n\n296\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.702\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n297\n00:13:03.702 --> 00:13:05.205\n&gt;&gt; And then you have 15 of them.\n\n298\n00:13:05.205 --> 00:13:06.994\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah exactly.\nBut [LAUGH] what you'll see if\n\n299\n00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:09.724\nyou look here you have\nthat entire color group.\n\n300\n00:13:09.724 --> 00:13:12.108\nNow you will notice,\nokay, it's not adding,\n\n301\n00:13:12.108 --> 00:13:14.200\nI keep wanting to hop in my Control Panel.\n\n302\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.790\nIt's not adding those shades and\nthis tints that you see,\n\n303\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.330\nbut it's just adding those core things.\n\n304\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.310\nAnd want this also points\nout to us is the option to\n\n305\n00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.630\nhave a color group in our swatch's panel.\n\n306\n00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.880\nSo if you see that there a bunch of colors\nthat you're working with, and, you know,\n\n307\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.240\nmaybe you're deciding that's the color for\nyour project or something like that.\n\n308\n00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.220\nYou can always save colors\ninto these folders.\n\n309\n00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.760\nYou can go ahead and create a new\ncolor group saving in a folder, and\n\n310\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.470\nthen it's kinda nice.\n\n311\n00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.122\nYou can kinda just drag and drag and\n\n312\n00:13:40.122 --> 00:13:43.140\ndrop things from your swatches\npanel into that folder.\n\n313\n00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.250\nSo that's a nice option that\nyou have there for you.\n\n314\n00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.600\n&gt;&gt; I use this a lot.\n\n315\n00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.630\nBecause sometimes,\nI do like to start with the color guides.\n\n316\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.760\nJust go ahead and give me the Home Depot\nor the Lowe's swatch book and\n\n317\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.720\nput it in there.\n\n318\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.480\nBut as I'm mixing my own colors,\nI don't want them kind of all mixed up,\n\n319\n00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.750\nif you wanna say, in that top area.\n\n320\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.110\nSo I wanna organize them into\nmy own folder, this group.\n\n321\n00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:10.200\nAnd that way it's easier for me to know\nthese are all of my client's colors,\n\n322\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.170\nor the project colors\nthat I'm working with and\n\n323\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.640\nall the other ones are just extraneous.\n\n324\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.870\nSo it's just kind easier\nto keep my brain in order\n\n325\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.870\nas to what colors I'm working with.\n\n326\n00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.540\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it's if you're OCD, you're\norganized, it's definitely gonna make your\n\n327\n00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.230\nlife a little bit easier to go ahead and\nput things into these folders.\n\n328\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.779\nSo that's a great option and\nthat's available whether or\n\n329\n00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:32.472\nnot you're working with the color guide\npanel, it's just something that you can do\n\n330\n00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:35.800\nin Illustrator Now, another cool\nfeature that Illustrator has for\n\n331\n00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.050\nus, it's called a swatch libraries menu.\n\n332\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.650\nThis is really handy when\nyou're working with very\n\n333\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.370\nspecific ideas of what you need and\nI'll kinda show you what that means.\n\n334\n00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.745\nSo, if I go into my swatches panel and\nthen go all the way to the bottom left,\n\n335\n00:14:48.745 --> 00:14:51.600\nyou'll see basically,\nkind of like a stack of books.\n\n336\n00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.130\nIf I click on that stack of books, it's\ngonna pull up my swatch libraries menu.\n\n337\n00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.310\nSo my swatch libraries menu,\n\n338\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.690\nyou can see just based on\nthe names I have things like Food.\n\n339\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.640\nI have things like Metal, Nature, Neutral.\n\n340\n00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.260\nOne of the ones that I really\nlike the best is Skintones.\n\n341\n00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.820\nSkintones are weirdly\nhard to create yourself.\n\n342\n00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.350\nSo what this basically does in saying, and\n\n343\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.980\nwe'll just foods as an example, I can go\nto Foods &gt; Ice Cream and it's gonna get me\n\n344\n00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.360\ncolors that you would typically use or\nthink of when you're work with ice cream.\n\n345\n00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.820\nLikewise, I mentioned, there's skin tones.\n\n346\n00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.320\nYou know,\nyou have a bunch of skin tone colors.\n\n347\n00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.790\nWhich again, seems really simple,\n\n348\n00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.980\nbut sometimes it can be difficult\nto mix these colors on your own.\n\n349\n00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.790\nSo at least if this gives you\na starting point, it's great.\n\n350\n00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.071\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar to the Color Guide,\nin a sense.\n\n351\n00:15:41.071 --> 00:15:41.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n352\n00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.160\n&gt;&gt; Because it's, but that's kinda based\noff of the different color combinations,\n\n353\n00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.310\nlike you said, color theory rules,\nor whatever you want to say.\n\n354\n00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.376\nHere, it's the same but\ndifferent, my favorite saying.\n\n355\n00:15:52.376 --> 00:15:54.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ice cream colors or skin tones.\n\n356\n00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:57.940\nSo it's kinda giving you like this,\nkinda general category.\n\n357\n00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.490\nAnd in making the folders we can\nsee right from there available\n\n358\n00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:06.000\nto you to be able to\nput into your swatches.\n\n359\n00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.997\nI'm jumping ahead.\n\n360\n00:16:07.997 --> 00:16:10.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, you're good.\n\n361\n00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.570\nYou can go ahead, yeah you can click\nto use these, you can go ahead and\n\n362\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.600\nif you click on the actual folder icon,\nyou'll see when I\n\n363\n00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.605\nclicked on that It went ahead and\nadded the entire color group for me.\n\n364\n00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:23.339\nI also I like that they give the names.\n\n365\n00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:25.210\nI hovered over this one Neapolitan, so\n\n366\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.860\ndepending on what kind of ice\ncream that you want that day.\n\n367\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.490\nIt's also available in sherbet.\n\n368\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.900\nI don't know why, just think that's funny.\n\n369\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.428\n&gt;&gt; I was actually wondering about was.\n\n370\n00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:35.425\nSherbet of course.\n\n371\n00:16:35.425 --> 00:16:37.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n372\n00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.303\nSo now I'm like, okay I'm hungry.\n\n373\n00:16:38.303 --> 00:16:42.230\n[LAUGH] So\nyou have these options available to you.\n\n374\n00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.675\nNow I just saw a banana split.\n\n375\n00:16:43.675 --> 00:16:45.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm sorry, but\n\n376\n00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.770\nyes it is a great feature.\n\n377\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.340\nAgain, specifically if you really are,\neven if you're just playing around,\n\n378\n00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.550\neven if you don't need something.\n\n379\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.800\nI'm not really making an ice\ncream cone in Illustrator but\n\n380\n00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.390\nI want those kind of shades of colors.\n\n381\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.970\nIt can be helpful, or just kind of\nsome inspiration available to you.\n\n382\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.770\nSo I really like it.\n\n383\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.330\nSomething else that I also really like.\n\n384\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.195\nWhen you're working with Efficiency,\nwe'll say, not laziness,\n\n385\n00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:15.330\n[LAUGH] necessarily is the Adobe color\nthemes panel, and this ones really cool.\n\n386\n00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.160\nSo we can go ahead, and\ngo to our window menu, and\n\n387\n00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.450\nI'm gonna go down to color themes.\n\n388\n00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.870\nI think Adobe color themes\nwas an old title for it now.\n\n389\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.330\nIt's just referred to as\nthe color themes panel.\n\n390\n00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:26.700\nWe can go ahead and grab that.\n\n391\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.180\nAnd what this does, okay,\nyou have this create option.\n\n392\n00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.330\nAnd the create option is cool.\n\n393\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.540\nYou can kinda move things around,\nwhatever.\n\n394\n00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.940\nBut what I really like, and you can go\nahead and save it if you find that you\n\n395\n00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.990\nreally like this color palette,\ncuz you're looking at that color.\n\n396\n00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.250\nColor palette here.\n\n397\n00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.760\nBut what I really like is\nworking with the Explore tab, so\n\n398\n00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.040\nyou see I am up here at the top\nof the Adobe color themes.\n\n399\n00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.390\nIf I go ahead click on that Explore,\nwhat you are gonna see,\n\n400\n00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.860\nis it's gonna take a second to load.\n\n401\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.890\nIt loads from a separate\nwebsite that the Adobe has,\n\n402\n00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:01.460\nwhere basically you can look at different\ncolor pallets that people are using.\n\n403\n00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.696\nAcross the globe and they basically\njust uploaded it to the site.\n\n404\n00:18:04.696 --> 00:18:06.648\n&gt;&gt; Is this is the kuler?\n\n405\n00:18:06.648 --> 00:18:07.917\nThe K-U-L-E-R.\n\n406\n00:18:07.917 --> 00:18:08.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nYes,\n\n407\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.638\nthis is the modern day kuler whatever.\n\n408\n00:18:12.638 --> 00:18:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYeah, that you use.\n\n409\n00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.100\nOf course mine is not loading so\nwe can't see the example,\n\n410\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.047\nbut basically what you have to work\nwith is a bunch of different swatches.\n\n411\n00:18:22.047 --> 00:18:23.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo that, yeah, and that's where he said,\n\n412\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.600\nlike it is pulling from the internet\nright now, and being able to come down,\n\n413\n00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.278\nand, oops, see.\n\n414\n00:18:28.278 --> 00:18:29.531\n&gt;&gt; Yes there we go.\n\n415\n00:18:29.531 --> 00:18:31.883\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what she's talk long ago,\n\n416\n00:18:31.883 --> 00:18:36.025\nyou're hoping like come on, come on,\ninternet you can do it, run those gerbils.\n\n417\n00:18:36.025 --> 00:18:38.795\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nit's like okay internet don't fail me now.\n\n418\n00:18:38.795 --> 00:18:43.485\nSo, what we can see, right now, you can\nsee I'm kind of exploring all themes.\n\n419\n00:18:43.485 --> 00:18:46.605\nBut I could click on this drop down\nmenu and explore most popular or\n\n420\n00:18:46.605 --> 00:18:47.755\nsomething like that.\n\n421\n00:18:47.755 --> 00:18:50.355\nAnd I can kind of scroll through and\nbe like, you know what?\n\n422\n00:18:50.355 --> 00:18:55.275\nI really like this January color scheme,\nand\n\n423\n00:18:55.275 --> 00:18:57.145\nyou can say okay,\nI want to go ahead and use that.\n\n424\n00:18:57.145 --> 00:19:01.240\nSo I can click to set as my active color,\nor what I can do\n\n425\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.630\nI can click on these three little dots\nin the bottom right hand side of that.\n\n426\n00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.460\nGo ahead and click on that.\n\n427\n00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.860\nYou can either choose to edit this theme,\nadd your favorites or\n\n428\n00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:09.840\nadd to your swatches.\n\n429\n00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.440\nIf I go ahead and\n\n430\n00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.540\nadd that to my swatches, there we\nhave another color group out of that.\n\n431\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.530\nSo that's really great.\n\n432\n00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.320\nYou can go ahead and start using it.\n\n433\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.710\nDefinitely something I like,\nif I am just stuck, and\n\n434\n00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.620\nI'm looking for inspiration and\nI really don't know where.\n\n435\n00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.520\nI know I want something that's green, but\nI don't really know where to go from that.\n\n436\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.130\nI can just scroll through here and\nbe like, okay,\n\n437\n00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.620\nyou know what, I think that I wanna\nwork with something like this.\n\n438\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.470\nAnd that'll at least give me a base.\n\n439\n00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:40.260\nIt's not copying,\nwe're just using our efficiency.\n\n440\n00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.450\n&gt;&gt; It's inspiration.\n\n441\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:42.743\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Exactly what you said.\n\n442\n00:19:42.743 --> 00:19:43.861\nYeah.\n\n443\n00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:47.170\nWe're no copies because a color's a color.\n\n444\n00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.820\nSo we just find it wherever you go.\n\n445\n00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.620\nThis is definitely like great\nway of saying, like, there's so\n\n446\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.750\nmany ways to kind of of find swatches,\n\n447\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:20:00.385\njust colors in general in Illustrator that\nit takes all of the guess work out of it.\n\n448\n00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:04.800\nWith all of these,\neverything the color guide, the libraries,\n\n449\n00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.960\nthe themes and it's nice and it's like\ncrowd sourcing cuz everybody's been\n\n450\n00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.845\nuploading this all together for\none website and you pull it down, yay.\n\n451\n00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:14.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n452\n00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.700\nIt's like thank you internet for\nsharing this with me and\n\n453\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.110\nmaking my life a little bit easier,\nbut yeah I totally agree with Vonne.\n\n454\n00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.340\nIllustrator is a great program because\nit does have all those color options\n\n455\n00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.060\navailable to you that some\nof the other ones don't.\n\n456\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.692\nSo I think that's where I want to leave\nit here, with just those basic ideas.\n\n457\n00:20:32.692 --> 00:20:36.307\nBut like said great options that you have\nin Illustrator available to you, and\n\n458\n00:20:36.307 --> 00:20:37.770\nI hope that you can enjoy them.\n\n459\n00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:42.585\n&gt;&gt; And I like to add one small\nlittle note at the bottom.\n\n460\n00:20:42.585 --> 00:20:46.175\nThat swatches are file specific.\n\n461\n00:20:46.175 --> 00:20:47.625\nYeah, you remember that one?\n\n462\n00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:49.457\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that was a good one.\n\n463\n00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:50.995\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you're going through and\n\n464\n00:20:50.995 --> 00:20:54.235\nadding all these swatches in this\nparticular file and then you close it,\n\n465\n00:20:54.235 --> 00:20:56.460\nwe talked about saving and everything.\n\n466\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.630\nAnd then you open another one and then\nyou're like, where are all my swatches?\n\n467\n00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:07.666\nWell they're that file specifically for,\nthey're saying that they're file specific.\n\n468\n00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:08.563\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n469\n00:21:08.563 --> 00:21:09.756\n&gt;&gt; And of course there's other ways of\n\n470\n00:21:09.756 --> 00:21:10.391\nyou can go ahead and\n\n471\n00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:12.790\nshare swatches which I know we're\ngonna talk about in a later episode.\n\n472\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.870\nWe're just getting you started.\n\n473\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.900\nBut I wanted to just throw that out there\nfor you just in case you kind of go,\n\n474\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.830\nwhat happened?\n\n475\n00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah in case you're thinking just open\n\n476\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.579\na new file, where did those go?\n\n477\n00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:26.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes that was a great point I'm glad you\n\n478\n00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.700\nmentioned that.\n\n479\n00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.072\n&gt;&gt; Right well, great introduction\nto where we can go ahead and\n\n480\n00:21:30.072 --> 00:21:33.770\nfind colors we can be efficient\n[LAUGH] and our color picking.\n\n481\n00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.500\nBut that sounds like a great place\nlike you said to go ahead and stop and\n\n482\n00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.100\nwe'll continue on with more.\n\n483\n00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.750\nSo signing off for CreativePro.TV,\nI'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n484\n00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.510\n&gt;&gt; And Emily Ramsey.\n\n485\n00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.312\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n486\n00:21:43.312 --> 00:21:45.697\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n",

edition of CREATIVEPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.183 --> 00:00:20.693\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\nwe are in our Illustrator CC 2017 show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:24.507\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nworking with multiple paths, lots and\n\n6\n00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:25.351\nlots of shapes.\n\n7\n00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.742\nAnd here to help us is Ms.\nEmily Ramsey, how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:27.742 --> 00:00:30.932\n&gt;&gt; I'm good,\nI know that's not the most exciting title.\n\n9\n00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:34.730\nIt's like, cool, it's not as much fun\nas color, or something like that, but\n\n10\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.817\nit is really helpful.\n\n11\n00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:36.509\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n12\n00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:37.052\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n13\n00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:40.787\nso we're going to be doing some\nselections, I know we have a whole agenda,\n\n14\n00:00:40.787 --> 00:00:42.283\nso why don't we get started?\n\n15\n00:00:42.283 --> 00:00:43.901\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what we're gonna do,\n\n16\n00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:46.575\nfirst thing we're gonna talk\nabout how to duplicate a path.\n\n17\n00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:50.978\nSo for me, to have to create a square,\nand then I want another square,\n\n18\n00:00:50.978 --> 00:00:53.682\nthen I have to go back\nto my rectangle tool.\n\n19\n00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:57.959\nI don't have to do that, so,\nhow can we easily duplicate a path?\n\n20\n00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:02.045\nAnd then we're gonna kind of move on from\nthere to talking a little about stocking\n\n21\n00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:04.162\norder, layers will kind of fit in there.\n\n22\n00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:08.205\nAnd then also grouping something, so\nif I know things want to go together,\n\n23\n00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:09.881\nhow can I kinda work with that?\n\n24\n00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:11.775\nSo let's go ahead and get started, and\n\n25\n00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:14.541\nwe're just gonna start off\nwith a blank workspace here.\n\n26\n00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.737\nAnd then what I'm gonna do,\nI'm just gonna create a shape,\n\n27\n00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:21.713\nso I wanna go ahead and\ncreate a rectangle.\n\n28\n00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:23.483\nNow, I'm gonna go back\nto my black arrow tool.\n\n29\n00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:27.155\nNow, say I'm working, and I'm like,\nI really think I want two rectangles here,\n\n30\n00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:28.795\nI wanna go ahead and duplicate that.\n\n31\n00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.352\nA couple of different options, the first\nkind of most common method that you're\n\n32\n00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:34.412\nprobably thinking is a copy, paste, right?\n\n33\n00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:37.893\nSo what we can do, we can use that\nin Illustrator, it's an option,\n\n34\n00:01:37.893 --> 00:01:41.391\nI like how I phrase that,\nyou can tell it's not my favorite option.\n\n35\n00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:46.282\n[LAUGH] What you can do, you can select\nyour option, or select your object, or\n\n36\n00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:47.506\nyour path rather.\n\n37\n00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:52.184\nAnd go ahead and hit a Cmd or\nCtrl+ C on your keyboard, C as in copy.\n\n38\n00:01:52.184 --> 00:01:56.317\nAnd this is a pretty standard computer\nkeyboard shortcut, if you will.\n\n39\n00:01:56.317 --> 00:02:01.213\nAnd then Cmd or Ctrl+V on your keyboard\nif you wanna go ahead and duplicate that.\n\n40\n00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:05.819\nSo that's Cmd or Ctrl+C,\nCmdon the Mac, CTRL on the PC,\n\n41\n00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.581\nCmd or Ctrl+V as in Vonne,\nV as in Vonne, yes.\n\n42\n00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:10.306\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:11.037\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n44\n00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:15.424\nremember me when you want to paste!\n\n45\n00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:18.054\nThe other thing that I always tell people\nto how to remember the C and the V,\n\n46\n00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:19.982\nbecause it's not P,\nbecause that's always print.\n\n47\n00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:22.774\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Is think about glue, and\n\n48\n00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:24.983\nglue comes to a point.\n\n49\n00:02:24.983 --> 00:02:25.877\nBack in kindergarten,\n\n50\n00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:29.420\nwhen you're using all of your glue,\nnow they use glue sticks and everything.\n\n51\n00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.195\n&gt;&gt; Anyways.\n\n52\n00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:31.450\n&gt;&gt; They're making slime, I don't know.\n\n53\n00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.627\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:33.140\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n55\n00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.683\nthat's what I remember with V.\n\n56\n00:02:34.683 --> 00:02:38.252\nAnd, of course, you always have, like,\nI think you can right click, and copy and\n\n57\n00:02:38.252 --> 00:02:40.003\npaste, you can also go to the Edit menu.\n\n58\n00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:42.482\nCopy, and paste is, I would say,\n\n59\n00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:48.054\npretty universal thing that all people\nknow, but you never assume, right?\n\n60\n00:02:48.054 --> 00:02:50.372\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, yes, absolutely.\n\n61\n00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:53.467\nAnd one of these things is, I didn't learn\nsome of these keyboard shortcuts until I\n\n62\n00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:54.851\nstarted working with Illustrator.\n\n63\n00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:57.111\nThat I could do in other programs,\nlike Microsoft Word or something.\n\n64\n00:02:57.111 --> 00:03:00.393\nBut yes, to Vonne's point,\nit is also available in the Edit menu,\n\n65\n00:03:00.393 --> 00:03:02.592\nif the keyboard shortcut\nis not your friend.\n\n66\n00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:05.812\nSo you can use Edit, Copy and\nthen Edit, Paste as well.\n\n67\n00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:09.595\nNow, as I mentioned, I think that\nthere's an easier method, [LAUGH], and\n\n68\n00:03:09.595 --> 00:03:12.012\nthat's gonna be your Alt,\nor your Option key.\n\n69\n00:03:12.012 --> 00:03:14.847\nFor some reason, this is just one of\nmy favorite things in Illustrator,\n\n70\n00:03:14.847 --> 00:03:17.641\nI don't know why, or again,\nin other Adobe programs, I just love it.\n\n71\n00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:18.603\nAnd it's so simple,\n\n72\n00:03:18.603 --> 00:03:21.922\nall I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select\nthis again with my black arrow tool.\n\n73\n00:03:21.922 --> 00:03:26.408\nAnd then when I wanna duplicate it,\nI'm gonna hold down my Alt or Option key,\n\n74\n00:03:26.408 --> 00:03:29.732\nAlt on a Mac, or I'm sorry,\nAlt on a PC, Option on a Mac.\n\n75\n00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.706\nAnd then what we're gonna do,\nyou see when you go ahead and\n\n76\n00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.783\nkind of hold down that Alt or Option key.\n\n77\n00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:39.460\nYou switch from having the one cursor\nwith kind of the box tail next to it but\n\n78\n00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.504\nyou have now a little triangle.\n\n79\n00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:44.480\nA little black triangle, and\na little white triangle, basically,\n\n80\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.234\nis what we are looking at for our cursor.\n\n81\n00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:49.827\nSo and that's just gonna kind of\nrepresent, hey, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n82\n00:03:49.827 --> 00:03:52.711\nduplicate this, so\nyou see kind of the double arrows there.\n\n83\n00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:55.243\nSo what we're gonna do,\nclick, hold and drag.\n\n84\n00:03:55.243 --> 00:03:58.485\nNow the only real trick to this\nis holding down that Alt or\n\n85\n00:03:58.485 --> 00:04:01.185\nOption key until you've\nlet go of your mouse.\n\n86\n00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:05.339\nSo what's gonna happen here, if I go, and\nI Alt or Option, and I drag and drop,\n\n87\n00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.153\nokay, great.\n\n88\n00:04:06.153 --> 00:04:09.151\nBut what if I go like this, and\nthen I let go of my Alt or Option?\n\n89\n00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:12.270\nYou can even see in my cursor that\nI've gone back to just having\n\n90\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.293\nthat single arrow.\n\n91\n00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:16.135\nAnd then I'm gonna drop there and\nit's gonna be like, wait a second,\n\n92\n00:04:16.135 --> 00:04:18.028\nall it did was move,\nit didn't duplicate it.\n\n93\n00:04:18.028 --> 00:04:21.420\nAnd that's just telling me that I let\ngo of my Alt or Option key too soon.\n\n94\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.082\nI cannot tell you how many times in a day,\nI use this all the time.\n\n95\n00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:27.889\nAgain, such a simple thing, but\n\n96\n00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.644\nit is going to just totally transform\nyour workflow in Illustrator.\n\n97\n00:04:31.644 --> 00:04:34.944\nSo, again, that's just Alt or Option,\nclick, hold and drag, and let go.\n\n98\n00:04:34.944 --> 00:04:35.732\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n99\n00:04:35.732 --> 00:04:41.187\nI think you can even do this in Photoshop\nif you want to duplicate, right?\n\n100\n00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:41.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n101\n00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:42.913\n&gt;&gt; Is it layer, Alt drag?\n\n102\n00:04:42.913 --> 00:04:46.147\nAlt drag is pretty,\nas soon as I started saying it, I'm like,\n\n103\n00:04:46.147 --> 00:04:47.805\nI actually forget what it does.\n\n104\n00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:49.687\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you can do it in InDesign,\n\n105\n00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:51.626\nyou can do it in most Adobe programs.\n\n106\n00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:56.392\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, so\nI love the Alt drag, because it's amazing.\n\n107\n00:04:56.392 --> 00:04:58.239\nIt's so much easier than having, and\n\n108\n00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:01.084\nI actually saw you try to do it\nin one of the other episodes.\n\n109\n00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:01.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n110\n00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:02.537\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, she's going for the alt drag,\n\n111\n00:05:02.537 --> 00:05:03.156\nbut she hasn't taught it yet.\n\n112\n00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:04.933\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't help myself.\n\n113\n00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:07.723\nIt's literally something that I\nuse that frequently, so yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:08.279\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n115\n00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.013\n&gt;&gt; So, she totally caught me,\n\n116\n00:05:10.013 --> 00:05:13.925\nshe called me out on it, but so\nwhat we're going to do from here.\n\n117\n00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:16.001\nNow okay, let's go ahead and\njust create a couple of shapes.\n\n118\n00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:20.302\nSo I've got my two squares, and then let's\nthrow a couple of other things in there.\n\n119\n00:05:20.302 --> 00:05:23.393\nSo we're gonna get really wild and\nadd a circle.\n\n120\n00:05:23.393 --> 00:05:27.781\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and start giving\nthese all a couple of different colors, so\n\n121\n00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:30.022\nI'm gonna go back to my black arrow tool.\n\n122\n00:05:30.022 --> 00:05:33.117\nBy the way, we've probably\nmentioned this in other videos, but\n\n123\n00:05:33.117 --> 00:05:34.704\njust in case you've forgotten.\n\n124\n00:05:34.704 --> 00:05:35.449\nThe hot key, or\n\n125\n00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.539\nthe keyboard shortcut, to go back to your\nblack arrow tool is always V, as in Vonne.\n\n126\n00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.760\n[LAUGH] So you may have seen me do that\nthere, I didn't actually go to my toolbar,\n\n127\n00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.594\nI just hit the V key on my keyboard.\n\n128\n00:05:45.594 --> 00:05:47.134\nTo get back to that black arrow tool, so\n\n129\n00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:49.393\nthat's always an option that\nyou have available to you.\n\n130\n00:05:49.393 --> 00:05:52.072\nSo I'm gonna have a couple of\nthings that I'm working with here.\n\n131\n00:05:52.072 --> 00:05:54.749\nBut what you'll notice is, okay,\n\n132\n00:05:54.749 --> 00:06:00.475\neverything that I've created is stacking\nin the order that I created them.\n\n133\n00:06:00.475 --> 00:06:03.601\nSo what I'm looking at here,\nespecially if I go like that,\n\n134\n00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:05.803\nI created the pink square first, right?\n\n135\n00:06:05.803 --> 00:06:09.889\nAnd then I duplicated that, and\nthen I created what's now green and\n\n136\n00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.553\nthen the circle, the circle that was last.\n\n137\n00:06:12.553 --> 00:06:16.934\nEverything by default in Illustrator will\nstack in the order that you created them.\n\n138\n00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:21.109\nNow, if you're new to Illustrator,\nyou might be going, like, shoot.\n\n139\n00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:24.206\nNow I have to go back and recreate\nsomething, first or last, or whatever,\n\n140\n00:06:24.206 --> 00:06:26.231\nbecause that's the order\nthat I wanted it to go.\n\n141\n00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:29.302\nAnd I definitely I feel like I\nhad that phase the very first\n\n142\n00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:32.064\ntime I opened Illustrator,\nlike how do I fix this?\n\n143\n00:06:32.064 --> 00:06:34.100\nVery easy to fix, of course, obviously.\n\n144\n00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.864\nSo what we're gonna do is we're just\ngonna work on our stacking order.\n\n145\n00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:41.036\nSo this is gonna kind of translate into\nlayers a little bit later, but for\n\n146\n00:06:41.036 --> 00:06:44.064\nright now, we're just gonna call\nit a stacking order, or Arrange.\n\n147\n00:06:44.064 --> 00:06:47.463\nSo what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go\nahead and select one of these paths.\n\n148\n00:06:47.463 --> 00:06:51.383\nSo I'm just gonna choose the blue circle,\ncuz that's what's on top, and then say,\n\n149\n00:06:51.383 --> 00:06:53.681\nI wanna go ahead and\nsend it behind these squares.\n\n150\n00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:57.710\nSo what I'm gonna do, it's very simple,\nI'm gonna right click on that, again,\n\n151\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.433\nI selected it with my black\narrow tool then right click.\n\n152\n00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:02.785\nAnd I'm just going to go down to Arrange,\nwith Arrange,\n\n153\n00:07:02.785 --> 00:07:04.212\nyou have four different options.\n\n154\n00:07:04.212 --> 00:07:09.313\nYou have Bring to Front, Bring Forward,\nSend Backward, and Send to Back.\n\n155\n00:07:09.313 --> 00:07:13.039\nSo what's going to happen here is,\nokay, obviously, this one's on top,\n\n156\n00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:13.922\nyou can see that.\n\n157\n00:07:13.922 --> 00:07:17.560\nSo if I try and do Bring Forward, or\nBring Front, or anything like that.\n\n158\n00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.683\nBring to Front, nothing's really going to\nhappen, because it's already at the front.\n\n159\n00:07:20.683 --> 00:07:25.931\nBut what I can do, I can right click, go\nto Arrange, Send Backward or Send to Back.\n\n160\n00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:30.061\nIf I choose Send Backward, it's gonna go\nback one path, if you will, at a time, so\n\n161\n00:07:30.061 --> 00:07:32.843\nit's gonna go behind the green,\nthen behind the pink.\n\n162\n00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:35.530\nIf I send it back, it's gonna\ngo all the way back behind them.\n\n163\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.827\nSo I will go ahead and choose Send\nBackward, and you'll see, there we go,\n\n164\n00:07:39.827 --> 00:07:41.614\nit went back behind the green.\n\n165\n00:07:41.614 --> 00:07:45.867\nNow I could do this again, right click,\nArrange, Send Backward again, and\n\n166\n00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:47.972\nI could send it all the way to the back.\n\n167\n00:07:47.972 --> 00:07:52.353\nOr now, because it's in the back,\nI could go ahead and right-click,\n\n168\n00:07:52.353 --> 00:07:54.039\nArrange, Bring to Front.\n\n169\n00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:57.465\nNow one of the important things to\nnote with this, and this will, again,\n\n170\n00:07:57.465 --> 00:07:59.359\nkinda translate into our layers later.\n\n171\n00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:03.941\nIs that, even though we're only looking at\nthree things right here It doesn't have to\n\n172\n00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:07.480\ndo specifically with the three\nthings that you're working with.\n\n173\n00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.040\nSo if I had other things on my art board,\nfor instance if I had a ton of other stuff\n\n174\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.550\ngoing on, and I was choosing to do a range\nbring forward or something like that or\n\n175\n00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.200\nsend backward It would go\nforward one object at a time.\n\n176\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.590\nSo even if I had something you know over\nhere that seemed totally unaffected,\n\n177\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.270\nit would still have to kind of climb\non to of that path of you will.\n\n178\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I actually have had\npeople say like it's not working.\n\n179\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.150\nIt's not working, it keeps setting back,\nsetting back, or backwards.\n\n180\n00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n181\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.890\nit's with all of the objects that\nare on your paper, if you want to say,\n\n182\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:48.190\nand throwing in another caveat,\nit's also within the layer.\n\n183\n00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.258\nIf you start using layers, and we haven't\neven mentioned them right now, so right\n\n184\n00:08:52.258 --> 00:08:56.577\nnow, think of everything on it's own layer\nor same layer, [CROSSTALK] we'll say that.\n\n185\n00:08:56.577 --> 00:09:01.265\nBut it is within the layer of\nhow you're sending forward and\n\n186\n00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:05.530\nsending back, so\nit throws another wrench in it.\n\n187\n00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.500\n&gt;&gt; It does,\ncuz sometimes you're looking at it and\n\n188\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.080\nyou think it should be as simple as this.\n\n189\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.520\nBut because you have\nother things going on,\n\n190\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.680\nit still needs to kinda move with that.\n\n191\n00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.690\nSo that is one thing to consider.\n\n192\n00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.820\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and take this other\nlittle dude off to the side here away and\n\n193\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.070\nwhat I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna go ahead and select this.\n\n194\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.830\nLet's just say,\nI'll even add some type with it.\n\n195\n00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.250\nWe're just gonna pretend that this\nis our logo, right, for a company.\n\n196\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.280\nNot the fanciest thing you've seen, but\n\n197\n00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.803\nwe're gonna just pretend for\nExplanation's sake, so.\n\n198\n00:09:38.803 --> 00:09:40.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's so\n\n199\n00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.330\ncrazy when you throw a couple shapes\ntogether, you're like poof, there you go.\n\n200\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's my logo, yes exactly.\n\n201\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.010\nSo we gonna pretend that\nthis is our logo and\n\n202\n00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.670\nwhat we are looking at here now say,\nI'm working in Illustrator and\n\n203\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.405\nI'm gonna move things around and\nwhatever and but how annoying would\n\n204\n00:09:58.405 --> 00:10:02.555\nit be if I had to select each of these\nobjects every time I wanted to move them.\n\n205\n00:10:02.555 --> 00:10:05.765\nThat is possible to\nselect multiple objects.\n\n206\n00:10:05.765 --> 00:10:07.505\nYou basically have two different methods.\n\n207\n00:10:07.505 --> 00:10:12.375\nMy personal efficient method of\nchoosing things is that I just\n\n208\n00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:16.610\nkinda like to select off to the side and\ngo ahead and grab everything off there.\n\n209\n00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.930\nSo, if I just click hold and drab over\neverything, it'll all select, or if you\n\n210\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.460\nneed to be more precise for whatever\nreason, a shift click will also work.\n\n211\n00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.400\nSo, you'll select something, shift click\non something, shift click on something\n\n212\n00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.756\nelse, and then you can go ahead and\nselect multiple objects.\n\n213\n00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:32.615\n&gt;&gt; On that like,\nkinda I did the same thing.\n\n214\n00:10:32.615 --> 00:10:33.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But just to kind of point\n\n215\n00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.970\nout in this particular product, that might\nbe a little different than other products,\n\n216\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.340\nyou don't have to fully\nencompass the whole object.\n\n217\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; All you have to do is touch it.\n\n218\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.510\nSo like for\nexample I'm now telling you what to do.\n\n219\n00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.180\n&gt;&gt; No, yes\n&gt;&gt; If you just wanted to kinda graze over\n\n220\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.970\nlike the pink and blue,\nyou don't have to get all the way.\n\n221\n00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.165\nSee right there.\n\n222\n00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:55.965\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n223\n00:10:55.965 --> 00:10:58.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo, you just touched those two pieces\n\n224\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.150\nwithin the selection marquis, we'll\ncall it, even though, it's not really\n\n225\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:08.760\na marquis, so just know that,\nit doesn't need the full encompassing.\n\n226\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd that's actually really a good\n\n227\n00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.580\npoint too, because when I am occasionally\nhave to work in PowerPoint for\n\n228\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.960\nwhatever reason and in PowerPoint I do\nknow you have to select everything,\n\n229\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.676\nhold it and drag,\nit drives me nuts every time.\n\n230\n00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:20.363\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n231\n00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:23.186\nAnd since I just got done teaching\nPowerPoint not too long ago.\n\n232\n00:11:23.186 --> 00:11:24.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You guys don't know like the order in\n\n233\n00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.170\nwhich we record these things but it's like\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n234\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.410\n&gt;&gt; That's why it's still fresh\nin my brain because I want to\n\n235\n00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.100\nuse PowerPoint like Illustrator.\n\n236\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.870\nAnd it's like no, I have to get\nback in Microsoft thinking so.\n\n237\n00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n238\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.690\nIt drives me nuts [LAUGH]\nbecause I'm used to this so\n\n239\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.075\nthose are the options that\nI would typically choose.\n\n240\n00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:43.060\nIt's more than likely I\nwould just kind of, again,\n\n241\n00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.090\nuse that marquee kind of click,\nhold and drag around.\n\n242\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.050\nSo now, let's say I always wanted\nthese things to go together,\n\n243\n00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.290\nat least for the time being I\nwanted these things to go together.\n\n244\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.760\nSo how can I tell Illustrator like I want\nthese to stick together all the time,\n\n245\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.580\nthis is my logo, so every time I'm it\naround in my art board I don't want\n\n246\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.660\nto have to click hold and drag and\nselect each of these individually.\n\n247\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.900\nSo what am I going to do?\n\n248\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.590\nI'm going to create a group out of it.\n\n249\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.310\nSo, we have the option that this is either\nsomething that you can right click and\n\n250\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.029\ncreate a group, again, I'm just in my\nblack arrow tool, or I believe you can go\n\n251\n00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:22.185\nto the object menu and choose group or,\nif you want to get fancy, Cmd or\n\n252\n00:12:22.185 --> 00:12:26.050\nCtrl+G on your keyboard will\nalso create a group for you.\n\n253\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.110\nYou'll notice that you saw\nthat in your objects menu,\n\n254\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.640\nyou saw the Cmd or Ctrl+G here.\n\n255\n00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.200\nPretty much any time you're looking in\nIllustrator you can always look for\n\n256\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.540\nthat as your keyboard shortcut.\n\n257\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.500\nJust a little tip there for you.\n\n258\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.640\nI'm a big fan of keyboard shortcuts\nas you probably have noticed,\n\n259\n00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.020\nso what I'm going to do, I'm just going\nto right click, choose group, and\n\n260\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:44.930\nyou'll see what happens now.\n\n261\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.550\nI'm just going to select\nthe blue circle here, and\n\n262\n00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.170\neverything will move around for us.\n\n263\n00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.950\nSo, it's basically just tying\neverything in together.\n\n264\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.580\nNow, what you may be thinking is like,\nwhat happens if I want to go back and\n\n265\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.620\nchange something?\n\n266\n00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.461\nWhat if I decide I don't\nwant that to be so large,\n\n267\n00:13:00.461 --> 00:13:03.375\nor if I want this circle to be in\ndifferent color, something like that.\n\n268\n00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:08.100\nWhat that's gonna bring in something\ncalled isolation mode, so, in order to\n\n269\n00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.670\nedit these objects individually,\nI need to pull into isolation mode.\n\n270\n00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.160\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nit's actually pretty simple,\n\n271\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.290\njust double click on one of the objects,\nit doesn't even have to be this specific\n\n272\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.220\none that you want to work with but\njust one of the objects in your groups.\n\n273\n00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.690\nSo I'm gonna double click\non this blue circle and\n\n274\n00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.890\nyou'll see now I have the ability\nto edit them individually.\n\n275\n00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:32.223\nBut what you'll also notice is that we\nhave this layer one and then group there,\n\n276\n00:13:32.223 --> 00:13:35.339\nthat's letting me know that\nI'm working with my group.\n\n277\n00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:40.061\nBecause what would happen is if I had, for\ninstance, something else on my art board,\n\n278\n00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:44.192\nI'll just drag that out there and\nthen double click to get into this group,\n\n279\n00:13:44.192 --> 00:13:48.145\neverything else is gonna be kind of,\nwhat's the word I am looking for?\n\n280\n00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:52.711\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something like that is what you\n\n281\n00:13:52.711 --> 00:13:53.490\nare gonna see.\n\n282\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.970\nSo, you are not gonna have the option to\nmove anything else on your art board,\n\n283\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.350\nyou are only gonna be able to move or\nadjust this.\n\n284\n00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.555\nBut now I can edit it,\nI can change the color,\n\n285\n00:14:01.555 --> 00:14:07.250\nwhatever I wanna do make this a little bit\nsmaller so it ties in a little bit better.\n\n286\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.657\nYou have the ability to do that.\n\n287\n00:14:08.657 --> 00:14:13.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I mean we've talked about\nthis when we do the basic selection\n\n288\n00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:18.960\nepisode because this right here can\nthrow people on a complete loop of like,\n\n289\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.910\nwhere am I, where'd I go?\n\n290\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.579\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n291\n00:14:21.579 --> 00:14:25.657\nif this is something like I've never\nseen this before, definitely check out\n\n292\n00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:30.090\nour selection episode, because we kind of\nbreak it down and put all into one place.\n\n293\n00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.770\nBut, definitely watch\nthat bar across the top.\n\n294\n00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; And then the other thing that\n\n295\n00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.420\nI always like to do, if you,\n\n296\n00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.980\ncuz how we get out of this isolation mode,\nwe just click off to the side, right?\n\n297\n00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Well, when you click off to the side,\n\n298\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.619\nalways look at the top left hand\ncorner of that control panel,\n\n299\n00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:49.167\nat least that's what I call it,\nthe top thing.\n\n300\n00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:49.893\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n301\n00:14:49.893 --> 00:14:53.847\n&gt;&gt; It will tell you group, so\nyou know that, that is a group, so\n\n302\n00:14:53.847 --> 00:14:57.900\nif I double click on it,\nI am going to get into isolation mode.\n\n303\n00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.940\nJust little things to be aware\nof when you're first starting,\n\n304\n00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.070\nlike we just take it for granted cuz\nwe're like here it is go, go, go, but\n\n305\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.890\njust watch those little things.\n\n306\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nabsolutely you just make a huge difference\n\n307\n00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.790\nespecially if you're unaccustomed to it.\n\n308\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.000\nSo, what I'm gonna do to get out\nof this is I'm gonna double click\n\n309\n00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.810\nas she mentioned.\n\n310\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.580\n&gt;&gt; Double click,\nI think I said single click.\n\n311\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.565\n&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't want to correct you but\nyeah, it's a double click.\n\n312\n00:15:19.565 --> 00:15:22.320\n[LAUGH] I wasn't going to call you out but\nI'm in here.\n\n313\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.500\nI'm just going to double click\noff to the side somewhere else.\n\n314\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.670\nSo I'm going to double click here and then\nyou'll see if I go ahead and select that.\n\n315\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.190\nThis is that group Vaughn was mentioning\na second ago, so we can see that in\n\n316\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.770\nthe very top left hand corner of my work\nspace essentially we see that group, so\n\n317\n00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.410\ngroups are definitely a good option for\nyou.\n\n318\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.070\nThere are other things that you\ncan do in Illustrator, of course,\n\n319\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.920\nto kind of combine these things,\nbut groups are a great\n\n320\n00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.720\njust kind of general thing you can to do\nsay I want these things to go together.\n\n321\n00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.290\nNow, what you may be thinking is\nare they stuck together forever?\n\n322\n00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.942\n[LAUGH] Do I have to work with\nthese things together all the time?\n\n323\n00:15:53.942 --> 00:15:57.054\nNo, not necessarily, so\nwhat I can do is I can right click.\n\n324\n00:15:57.054 --> 00:15:57.871\nAnd then Ungroup.\n\n325\n00:15:57.871 --> 00:16:01.611\nSo basically, all the same options\nthat we had to create a group,\n\n326\n00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:04.340\nwe'll have to create,\nto Ungroup something.\n\n327\n00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.851\nSo I can right-click [SOUND].\n\n328\n00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:09.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can right-click Ungroup.\n\n329\n00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:14.300\nI can also go to Object, Ungroup, or\nI believe it's a Shift+Ctrl+G to go ahead\n\n330\n00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.740\nand Ungroup something, so those are the\noptions that you have available to use.\n\n331\n00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.480\nYou see,\nyou're not stuck with that forever.\n\n332\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and way back on the day,\nthey didn't have the isolation mode,\n\n333\n00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.930\nyou only had to, you had something\ngrouped, you had to ungroup it.\n\n334\n00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.410\nTo be able to do what you need\nto do then select a back up.\n\n335\n00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.444\nYeah, I mean we're talking a long,\nlong, long time ago.\n\n336\n00:16:35.444 --> 00:16:37.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A basic name.\n\n337\n00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.036\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n338\n00:16:38.036 --> 00:16:41.279\nit's nice to be able to keep\nit together yet separate and\n\n339\n00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:43.560\nyou can go into it and be able to modify.\n\n340\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.258\nSo I love isolation mode.\n\n341\n00:16:45.258 --> 00:16:50.260\nIt's just for newbies,\njust being aware of what it's doing.\n\n342\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.270\nIt's good.\n\n343\n00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.230\nAnd once you get used to it,\nyou'll use it all the time.\n\n344\n00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.788\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n345\n00:16:54.788 --> 00:16:56.090\nI totally agree.\n\n346\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.965\nFor example's sake, I'm gonna go\nahead just to kinda move this along.\n\n347\n00:16:58.965 --> 00:17:01.430\nI'm gonna go ahead and keep this\ngroup because I wanna go ahead and\n\n348\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.680\nshow you guys something\nelse to do with layers.\n\n349\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.010\nAnd I'm just gonna add a couple\nof other little random bits and\n\n350\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.890\nbobbles on my art board here, just so\nwe can kinda see for some examples here.\n\n351\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.910\nMaybe I'll give these\na couple different colors,\n\n352\n00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.466\njust I'm always in the bright colors.\n\n353\n00:17:18.466 --> 00:17:20.860\n[LAUGH] Everything is like a rainbow here.\n\n354\n00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.580\nSo we'll live with that and\nnow what I wanna talk about is layers.\n\n355\n00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.290\nNow if you are somebody who's\naccustomed to Photoshop,\n\n356\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.560\nyou were probably surprise that we\nhaven't mention the word layers.\n\n357\n00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.770\nMore than we have up until this point.\n\n358\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.820\nAnd that is because thank goodness for\n\n359\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.370\npeople like me, Illustrator is\nnot a layer-dependent program.\n\n360\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.670\nSo you do not have to work with layers.\n\n361\n00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.300\nNow, when you're doing things, like we\nwere talking about with the arrange,\n\n362\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.900\nbring forward, send it back.\n\n363\n00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.157\nTechnically, you're kinda\nworking with layers here, but\n\n364\n00:17:48.157 --> 00:17:50.734\nyou can kinda get away with not\nreally touching this in Illustrator.\n\n365\n00:17:50.734 --> 00:17:55.900\nBut to the same effect you can\nuse them as much as you want.\n\n366\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.680\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and pull up\nthe layers panels so you can, guys,\n\n367\n00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.600\ncan kinda get an idea of\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n368\n00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.710\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and pull out\nthe panel so I can have it up here so\n\n369\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.310\nmaybe you guys can see\nit a little bit better.\n\n370\n00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.760\nBut basically what our\nlayers panel does is\n\n371\n00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.620\nshows you the organization of our\ninformation on our art board,\n\n372\n00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.170\nor really just in our illustrator\nwork space in general.\n\n373\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.660\nSo you'll see right now,\nif I go ahead and collapse that,\n\n374\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.840\nyou'll see technically right now\nwe have everything on one layer.\n\n375\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.040\nEverything is on layer one.\n\n376\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.660\nBut if I kinda open that up,\nyou'll see the arrangement or\n\n377\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.870\nthe order of that layer.\n\n378\n00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.450\nSo right now what we're looking at.\n\n379\n00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.610\nThis blue circle.\n\n380\n00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.750\nThis is at the very top.\n\n381\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.940\nSo if I were to try and do for instance,\nyou know maybe I'll grab this black.\n\n382\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.490\nThen arrange, bring to front or\nsomething like that.\n\n383\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.930\nWhat you're gonna see is how that\nreflects on my layers panel.\n\n384\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.330\nSo that's gonna go ahead and\nbring that to the top.\n\n385\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.460\nAnd you can always see what layer or\n\n386\n00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.810\nwhat I should say really\nwhat path you have selected.\n\n387\n00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:56.173\nBecause it'll be indicated by,\nin this case, what is a blue square,\n\n388\n00:18:56.173 --> 00:18:58.292\nthat'll change when we create new layers.\n\n389\n00:18:58.292 --> 00:19:00.230\nBut in this case, it's a blue square.\n\n390\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.414\nAnd you can also use these kind\nof tier advantage to go ahead and\n\n391\n00:19:02.414 --> 00:19:03.130\nselect something.\n\n392\n00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.186\nSo if I knew I wanted to\nselect that blue circle, but\n\n393\n00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:09.750\nI was having kind of a hard time\ngrabbing it in Illustrator.\n\n394\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.170\nSometimes it can be kind of\ndifficult to grab something,\n\n395\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.020\njust depending on how you have\neverything stacked and whatever.\n\n396\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.310\nYou can go ahead and\nclick on those little circles, so\n\n397\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.950\nif I click on I need to\nclick off of it first.\n\n398\n00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.620\nBut if I click on that circle there,\nit'll go ahead and select it for you.\n\n399\n00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.380\nSo again,\nmay seem like a simple thing here\n\n400\n00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.200\nbecause everything's kind of far away,\nbut it does really come in handy.\n\n401\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.630\n&gt;&gt; And it's not the layer name.\n\n402\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.060\nIf you clicked on the rectangle and\nthe yellow,\n\n403\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.930\njust selected or highlighted that layer or\nsub layer there.\n\n404\n00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:40.750\nI don't even know.\n\n405\n00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.890\n&gt;&gt; Sub layer.\n&gt;&gt; Is that what they call them?\n\n406\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:42.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sub layer.\n\n407\n00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.427\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I think I keep calling everything\n\n408\n00:19:44.427 --> 00:19:45.385\na layer but yeah sub layer.\n\n409\n00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:48.313\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That thing that says yellow wisps,\n\n410\n00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:50.100\nwhatever or rectangle.\n\n411\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.460\nIt's not gonna select it that way.\n\n412\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.930\nYou have to click on that little target.\n\n413\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:55.900\nThat little circle,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n414\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.750\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\nThat's the only way that it's going to,\n\n415\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.240\nselect the object on the art board itself.\n\n416\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, absolutely.\n\n417\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.280\nYou have to go ahead and\nclick on that circle.\n\n418\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.672\nIt can be a little bit confusing I think\nat first, it even kinda throw me off\n\n419\n00:20:09.672 --> 00:20:13.174\na little bit, cuz I would think that I\ncould just click on that blue square and\n\n420\n00:20:13.174 --> 00:20:15.013\nhave something selected or whatever.\n\n421\n00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:18.590\nBut and you can also see part of\nthe reason why I left that group so,\n\n422\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.730\nyou could see the way the groups\nlook in our layers panel.\n\n423\n00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.460\nSo, if I go ahead and\ndo a drop down menu here, or\n\n424\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.190\njust click on that little\narrow to drop everything down,\n\n425\n00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.530\nyou'll notice I have all\nthe individual elements in my group.\n\n426\n00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.350\nAnd, handy thing, you can go ahead and\nselect those individually.\n\n427\n00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.010\nSo, if you did not want to go into\nisolation mode for whatever reason,\n\n428\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.280\nwe mentioned it kind of throws people off.\n\n429\n00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.130\nI still have that option even for\n\n430\n00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.680\nsomething that's grouped to\nselect these items individually.\n\n431\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.790\nSo that's kind of a handy thing.\n\n432\n00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.420\n&gt;&gt; And I think if you expanded\nthe layer panel out more,\n\n433\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.260\nyou could see more like the names-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n434\n00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.100\n&gt;&gt; Next to it.\n\n435\n00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n436\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.923\nOkay.\nAnd I've-\n\n437\n00:20:53.923 --> 00:20:54.423\n&gt;&gt; You're so smart.\n\n438\n00:20:54.423 --> 00:20:56.036\n[LAUGH]\n\n439\n00:20:56.036 --> 00:20:56.968\n&gt;&gt; And like you said,\n\n440\n00:20:56.968 --> 00:21:00.695\nwe were talking before the show about\nwhen I first start using Illustrator,\n\n441\n00:21:00.695 --> 00:21:02.320\nI never want to do layers now.\n\n442\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I never worked in it.\n\n443\n00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.490\nI never made new ones and\nI never did anything with it.\n\n444\n00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.730\nBecause it was almost like\nsuch a freedom from Photoshop.\n\n445\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah,\nto think about this.\n\n446\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.900\nBut the more I used Illustrator,\nthen I was like,\n\n447\n00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:21.245\nI can kinda combine if you wanna say,\nthe Photoshopness of it into here.\n\n448\n00:21:21.245 --> 00:21:24.301\nHow I can work with it more to my\nadvantage to keep myself organized and\n\n449\n00:21:24.301 --> 00:21:26.991\neverything like that, but\nlike right here with the group and\n\n450\n00:21:26.991 --> 00:21:28.375\nthen being able to isolate it.\n\n451\n00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:32.158\nAnd then, from right here with that,\n\n452\n00:21:32.158 --> 00:21:37.016\nI think with the pink\nsquare selected right now.\n\n453\n00:21:37.016 --> 00:21:39.961\nThen you could ahead and\nchange the fill cloud from the top and\n\n454\n00:21:39.961 --> 00:21:43.990\neverything so you don't even have to get\ninto those other ways that we did it, so.\n\n455\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n456\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.864\n&gt;&gt; Multiple ways, you know,\nto do things, so consider.\n\n457\n00:21:46.864 --> 00:21:47.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Always,\n\n458\n00:21:47.665 --> 00:21:51.509\nthere's always like ten different\nways to explain something, so yeah.\n\n459\n00:21:51.509 --> 00:21:54.820\n[LAUGH] But one of the beautiful\nthings about Illustrator at the same,\n\n460\n00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.080\nyou can pick your own way of doing it.\n\n461\n00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.940\nSo, these are basically,\nas we mention here,\n\n462\n00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.740\nwe're really just working\nwith sublayers right now.\n\n463\n00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.430\nSo, you can see, everything is\nstill collapsed under my layer 1.\n\n464\n00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:08.490\nI could use these little eyeballs\nas like to call them, kinda hide\n\n465\n00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:13.340\nthings all together, hide the entire layer\nif I wanted to get rid of everything.\n\n466\n00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.540\nBut what I could also do is I could\nalso add another layer to this.\n\n467\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.810\nSo depending on how you wanna organize\nyour information, we kinda joked\n\n468\n00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:25.240\nbefore this that neither of us really\nused these when we first started out.\n\n469\n00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.415\nBut as you get going you might wanna start\nto organize things a little bit better.\n\n470\n00:22:29.415 --> 00:22:31.390\nEspecially if you have\na lot of things going on.\n\n471\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.452\nSo what I can do, I'm gonna go ahead and\ncollapse that Layer 1.\n\n472\n00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:37.440\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and just click on\nmy post-it-note, so similar to how we've\n\n473\n00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.770\ndone it in other, you know,\nlike creating a new swatch, basically.\n\n474\n00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.590\nI'm gonna click that little post-it-note\nicon to create a new layer.\n\n475\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.030\nNow, right now I don't have\nanything on that layer but\n\n476\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:52.700\nyou'll see if I select Layer 2 and\nthen I go ahead and create something.\n\n477\n00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.654\nBy default, it's going to be on Layer 2.\n\n478\n00:22:54.654 --> 00:22:56.253\nHow do I know it's on Layer 2?\n\n479\n00:22:56.253 --> 00:23:00.197\nOne, because I can foresee it in\nmy layers panel, but then also,\n\n480\n00:23:00.197 --> 00:23:02.290\nbecause it has a red path outline.\n\n481\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:08.490\nSo maybe I'll make this one just like tan,\nso you could see it a little bit better.\n\n482\n00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.834\nThat red path outline is indicating to\nme that I'm now working on Layer 2.\n\n483\n00:23:11.834 --> 00:23:16.600\nIf I were to create another layer,\nand then make another object.\n\n484\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.930\nYou can see I now have that green path\noutline, so that's letting me know that\n\n485\n00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.320\nI'm working on Layer 1, Layer 2,\nLayer 3 and so on and so forth.\n\n486\n00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.860\nAnd kind of nice thing about this is,\n\n487\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.980\nsay I have something that I want to\nmove from one layer to the other.\n\n488\n00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.410\nSo I have this black square and\n\n489\n00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.340\nI really want the black square\nto be on Layer 3, for example.\n\n490\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.960\nCuz Layer 3 in my case\nright now is on top.\n\n491\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.620\nAnd I want this to be on top of this\nother element that's on Layer 3, but\n\n492\n00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.410\nI can't move it because I\ndon't have that option.\n\n493\n00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.055\nAgain, that's kinda at a range,\nbring forward, send it back.\n\n494\n00:23:48.055 --> 00:23:49.221\nYeah\n&gt;&gt; It's cool.\n\n495\n00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:52.340\n&gt;&gt; You could go ahead and\ntake that black rectangle, and\n\n496\n00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.302\ndo sent to front all day long,\nit's never going to go on top of that.\n\n497\n00:23:56.302 --> 00:23:57.112\nTan circles.\n\n498\n00:23:57.112 --> 00:23:58.703\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; There's that layer aspect, and so\n\n499\n00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:01.660\nmaybe you're going, okay,\nnow I know what you're talking about.\n\n500\n00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.888\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah exactly, exactly,\na range brain to front,\n\n501\n00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:09.546\ntan to back is only gonna work within a\nlayer, it's not gonna climb other layers.\n\n502\n00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:10.602\nIn that case,\n\n503\n00:24:10.602 --> 00:24:15.806\nI need to move this black square to\nlayer three when I'm looking at it.\n\n504\n00:24:15.806 --> 00:24:19.463\nSo a nice thing that you could do,\nI have this black square selected.\n\n505\n00:24:19.463 --> 00:24:23.232\nI always know when I have something\nselected that it's indicated by this\n\n506\n00:24:23.232 --> 00:24:24.791\nlittle blue square, right.\n\n507\n00:24:24.791 --> 00:24:28.023\nAnd I can even see if I kind\nof release that down that,\n\n508\n00:24:28.023 --> 00:24:30.820\nthat black square is selected here.\n\n509\n00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.170\nWhat I can do, even with this collapsed,\nI can click, hold, and\n\n510\n00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.610\ndrag that blue square to Layer 3.\n\n511\n00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.490\nSo I can click, hold, and drag this little\nsquare right here, drag it up to Layer 3,\n\n512\n00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.070\nand now that black square is on Layer 3.\n\n513\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.632\nSo I can go ahead and then move\nthat on top of that other object.\n\n514\n00:24:47.632 --> 00:24:52.081\nSo kinda nice, you can move pretty easily,\nI would say between layers.\n\n515\n00:24:52.081 --> 00:24:56.161\nI could also, for instance,\nif I wanted to make Layer 3 in the middle,\n\n516\n00:24:56.161 --> 00:25:00.244\nI could make Layer 3 Layer 2 all you\nhave to do is drag and drop oops!\n\n517\n00:25:00.244 --> 00:25:03.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta watch the lines.\n\n518\n00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:04.748\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, I messed my lines.\n\n519\n00:25:04.748 --> 00:25:06.223\n&gt;&gt; So many times-\n&gt;&gt; Drag and drop.\n\n520\n00:25:06.223 --> 00:25:11.139\n&gt;&gt; You can basically nest layers inside\nof layers, inside of layers, and so\n\n521\n00:25:11.139 --> 00:25:16.890\nthat first thing that you did you actually\nkind of put it inside of that other layer.\n\n522\n00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Watch those lines when you are dragging\n\n523\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:25.130\nand dropping for the organization or\nstacking order of the layers is kinda\n\n524\n00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:30.390\nkey and just, I always tell people to go\nslow, watch the lines and then let go.\n\n525\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.794\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go slower than I did.\n\n526\n00:25:31.794 --> 00:25:36.169\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My god, whatever, we got it, so yeah,\n\n527\n00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:38.420\nso we can drag and drop.\n\n528\n00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.650\nSee I'm going from there from Layer 2,\nyou see that blue line there, that's\n\n529\n00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:47.090\nindicating to me, okay I'm gonna drag that\nbetween Layer 2 and Layer 3, I let go.\n\n530\n00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.770\nNow Layer 3 is actually in between, and\n\n531\n00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.480\nI'm trying to find something\nthat was on Layer 3.\n\n532\n00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.690\nI'm like, what's where?\n\n533\n00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.180\nYou can see Layer 3,\n\n534\n00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.760\neven though this black square is on the\ntop of Layer 3, it's still below Layer 2.\n\n535\n00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.400\nNow all these numbers are kinda\nsounding confusing, right?\n\n536\n00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.040\nI'm going Layer 3, Layer 1,\nthey're out of order.\n\n537\n00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.510\nWhat is this thing?\n\n538\n00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.630\nYou could rename these [LAUGH], okay?\n\n539\n00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.100\nSo if the numbers are just too much for\nyou like they are for\n\n540\n00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:17.160\nme, all I have to do to rename a layer\nis just double-click on the words.\n\n541\n00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.385\nDon't try and double-click\nover here on the layer itself,\n\n542\n00:26:19.385 --> 00:26:22.350\ndouble-click on the actual name.\n\n543\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.030\nAnd you can see I can go ahead and\nrename that.\n\n544\n00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:28.850\nSo I'm gonna call that Tan Circle, just\nthinking that there's nothing else there,\n\n545\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.960\nif there is, then that won't work.\n\n546\n00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.120\nBut that works [LAUGH] there, so we'll\ncall that tan circle, you can go ahead and\n\n547\n00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.250\ngive this Layer 3.\n\n548\n00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:39.615\nI'm just gonna double click,\nI'm gonna call that the Vonne layer.\n\n549\n00:26:39.615 --> 00:26:41.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You get your own layer.\n\n550\n00:26:41.025 --> 00:26:42.578\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well you can get your own layer too!\n\n551\n00:26:42.578 --> 00:26:43.972\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay, yeah, I'll be Layer 1.\n\n552\n00:26:43.972 --> 00:26:44.981\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n553\n00:26:44.981 --> 00:26:48.045\n&gt;&gt; Double click,\nwe'll call that Vonne, Emily, and\n\n554\n00:26:48.045 --> 00:26:51.940\nthe Tan Circle,\nthat sounds like a band, right?\n\n555\n00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.530\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\n\n556\n00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, we can go ahead and\n\n557\n00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:58.140\ngive them the names,\nwhatever you feel like works best for you.\n\n558\n00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.846\nCertainly, I'm somebody that I think that,\n\n559\n00:26:59.846 --> 00:27:01.563\nthat makes a little bit\nmore sense in my brain.\n\n560\n00:27:01.563 --> 00:27:08.737\n&gt;&gt; And I will tell you, that the moving of\nthe dot, huge for me, I use this all time.\n\n561\n00:27:08.737 --> 00:27:13.728\nCuz talking about how like we don't really\nthink of layers in illustrator first, so\n\n562\n00:27:13.728 --> 00:27:18.155\nI might draw something and then get it\nall together and then be like, okay,\n\n563\n00:27:18.155 --> 00:27:21.132\nnow I want to kind of start\nlike organizing it out.\n\n564\n00:27:21.132 --> 00:27:25.263\nSo I'll put it all on one layer, then\nstart making my own layers on top of them,\n\n565\n00:27:25.263 --> 00:27:28.219\nselecting the pieces,\nthen dragging that little dot.\n\n566\n00:27:28.219 --> 00:27:33.200\nSo maybe all my text is on one layer,\nand my logos on another layer.\n\n567\n00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.010\nAnd sometimes I even use layers to\nwhereas like do I like this look or\n\n568\n00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.440\ndo I like that look?\n\n569\n00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.033\nAnd so\nthen I can kinda turn them on and off,\n\n570\n00:27:41.033 --> 00:27:42.900\nlike you were talking about the eyeballs.\n\n571\n00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.040\nAnd so I can kinda get a look so I'm not\nmaking multiple files, I'm just kinda\n\n572\n00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.200\nusing layers as like my proof one,\nproof two, proof three if you wanna say.\n\n573\n00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And kinda get an idea, so\n\n574\n00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.480\nit's not deleting, it's just hiding,\nit's in its own layer.\n\n575\n00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.120\nSo just a little kinda\ntidbits from Vonne's little\n\n576\n00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.860\nway of using Illustrator and all these\ntimes I've had to do logo creations.\n\n577\n00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.454\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you're work with clients,\n\n578\n00:28:07.454 --> 00:28:08.860\nyou wanna give them different options.\n\n579\n00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just throw them in layers.\n\n580\n00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:15.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you did this,\nduplicated it, something like that.\n\n581\n00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.010\nPut these on two different layers.\n\n582\n00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:20.620\nWe'll make a new one,\nI totally agree with you.\n\n583\n00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.100\nJust to be able to toggle it on and\noff and look at the options that you have.\n\n584\n00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:29.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love using that, so, and that\nlittle dot, I think it's in InDesign too.\n\n585\n00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.986\nIt's in a couple different\nplaces that's available.\n\n586\n00:28:32.986 --> 00:28:37.560\nAnd I utilize it to the ninth degree,\nand so just so you know,\n\n587\n00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.465\nI love that little part.\n\n588\n00:28:39.465 --> 00:28:41.032\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n589\n00:28:41.032 --> 00:28:45.580\nI think layers in general,\nit's just really how you wanna use them.\n\n590\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.160\nYou don't have to use them, but\n\n591\n00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.900\nI do think using them to your\nadvantage can certainly come in handy.\n\n592\n00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.710\nEspecially, I think Vonne's\nmentioned a great example,\n\n593\n00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.620\nwhen you're trying to kind of flip between\noptions and you wanna look at them\n\n594\n00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:01.330\neach individually it can be a nice way\nto use that with that toggle on and off.\n\n595\n00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.370\nSo I think that's really all\nthat I wanna mention for layers.\n\n596\n00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.055\nThat's a good introduction\nof how to use them.\n\n597\n00:29:06.055 --> 00:29:08.314\nAs I've said a thousand\ntimes at this point,\n\n598\n00:29:08.314 --> 00:29:10.584\nit's really up to you\nhow you wanna use them.\n\n599\n00:29:10.584 --> 00:29:14.296\nBut remember working with your multiple\nobjects, remember that Alt drag,\n\n600\n00:29:14.296 --> 00:29:17.313\nthat one's gonna come in handy\nin grouping and ungrouping and\n\n601\n00:29:17.313 --> 00:29:19.649\nsome of the other options\nthat you have as well.\n\n602\n00:29:19.649 --> 00:29:21.088\nSo I think that's it.\n\n603\n00:29:21.088 --> 00:29:25.582\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome, yeah, all the things\nthat I use on a daily basis so many times.\n\n604\n00:29:25.582 --> 00:29:29.126\nAnd hopefully now you guys will\nuse it on a daily basis and\n\n605\n00:29:29.126 --> 00:29:33.740\nsee the beautiful things that these\ndifferent things can do for you.\n\n606\n00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.410\nDifferent, how many times\ndid we say different?\n\n607\n00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.385\nAll right, we're gonna stop.\n\n608\n00:29:36.385 --> 00:29:40.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So wrapping it up,\nsigning off for Creative Pro TV,\n\n609\n00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.670\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n610\n00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n611\n00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.443\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.580\nHi, welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.570\nWe're glad to be back.\n\n13\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.281\nWhy can't I talk?\n\n14\n00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:37.548\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, yes,\n\n15\n00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:41.910\nso we're basically just going to liberate\nourselves from all of the rectangles and\n\n16\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.330\ncircles and all the crazy\nstuff that you've been doing.\n\n17\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.820\nI'm gonna do some freehand drawing.\n\n18\n00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.800\nThe funny thing about Illustrator is,\nI'm a graphic designer by day.\n\n19\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.570\nI do this all day long.\n\n20\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.135\nI don't really feel like I free-hand draw,\nvery well, right?\n\n21\n00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:57.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can do a lot in Illustrator without\n\n22\n00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.670\nhaving the ability to free-hand draw.\n\n23\n00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.800\nBut it is an option there that's available\nto you, because Illustrator is great for\n\n24\n00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.690\nthings like cartoons or\ndrawings or whatever it may be.\n\n25\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.540\nIt has a lot of different\noptions available to you.\n\n26\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.347\nSo we'll go ahead and\nget into free-hand drawing.\n\n27\n00:01:11.347 --> 00:01:13.860\nNow, with this pretty much, I think,\n\n28\n00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.518\nall the tools that we're gonna mention\nhere, are gonna be related to open path.\n\n29\n00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:21.600\nSo we're gonna need to have that stroke\ncolor applied, things like that, and\n\n30\n00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.730\njust kind of being aware of the fact\nthat we are on an open path.\n\n31\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.080\nSo with our freehand drawing,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.480\nstart off with paint brush tool.\n\n33\n00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.340\nSo I'm going to go ahead and grab a little\nmore of a fun color than just black,\n\n34\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.940\nwhy not?\n\n35\n00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.234\n&gt;&gt; And just a quick note,\ncould you definitely, you wanna head and\n\n36\n00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:40.550\nclear the fill.\n\n37\n00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes, good point.\n\n38\n00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:44.384\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you keep the fill on,\n\n39\n00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:49.044\nthen even though it's an open path\nit looks like it's filled and\n\n40\n00:01:49.044 --> 00:01:50.870\nclosed, but it's not.\n\n41\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.450\nAnd so it can be a little misleading,\nso try to remember to blank out or\n\n42\n00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.860\ndo the None fill, and\nwhatever color stroke.\n\n43\n00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.600\nAnd make sure you do have a color on the\nstroke too, cuz then it won't show up, so.\n\n44\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely, always make sure,\nthat is a great point,\n\n45\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.730\nthat you don't actually have a color here.\n\n46\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.600\nSo choose the one that's Blank\nwith a slash through it, so true.\n\n47\n00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.470\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhop into my paintbrush, but\n\n48\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.900\nyou can also use the keyboard shortcut.\n\n49\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.460\nJust the letter B on your keyboard.\n\n50\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.420\nSo go ahead and grab that.\n\n51\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.115\nNow, paintbrush tool,\nthis is not really all that shocking.\n\n52\n00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:23.250\nSo, when we grab our paintbrush tool,\nwhat do we expect to happen?\n\n53\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.550\nWe expect it to look a little\nmore like a paintbrush.\n\n54\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.840\nSo I can go ahead and go like this.\n\n55\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.890\nAnd draw something and\n\n56\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.900\nit's gonna feel somewhat more natural\nkind of like a paint brush, right?\n\n57\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.970\nSo I can go ahead and take that and\nI believe, if I remember correctly, yes,\n\n58\n00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.990\nwe have a keyboard shortcut to adjust.\n\n59\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.093\nI had to think about that one.\n\n60\n00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:45.370\n[LAUGH] We have a keyboard shortcut to\nadjust kind of the width of this here.\n\n61\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.940\nSo, you'll see by default it should\nhave been fairly slender there.\n\n62\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.310\nBut if I actually use the brackets on\nmy keyboard, I can make that wider and\n\n63\n00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.788\nbigger, that kind of diameter of my brush,\nif I will.\n\n64\n00:02:56.788 --> 00:03:00.440\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nuse the right bracket, just go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.560\nbump that up, kind of click it\na couple of different times,\n\n66\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.580\nand then you can go ahead and\nadjust the diameter.\n\n67\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.580\n&gt;&gt; And this is the same in Photoshop,\nif you're using a Photoshop brush,\n\n68\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.760\nyou'll do it, the thing with the brushes\nin Photoshop is you can actually kinda see\n\n69\n00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.380\nthe diameter getting bigger or smaller.\n\n70\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.160\nIn this one,\nyou just have to kinda trust it.\n\n71\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was what was\nkinda throwing me off honestly.\n\n72\n00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.720\nYeah, I was just kinda like.\n\n73\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.745\n&gt;&gt; Is this working?\n\n74\n00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:25.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n75\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.740\nSo, you'll just use that\nto adjust your diameter.\n\n76\n00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.890\nAgain, that's the right and\nleft brackets there, so\n\n77\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.397\nwe can use those to make that\ndiameter larger and smaller.\n\n78\n00:03:33.397 --> 00:03:36.140\nNow,\n&gt;&gt; Sorry one more point because\n\n79\n00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.770\nI was actually watching the control\npanel up at the top and like,\n\n80\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.040\n&gt;&gt; But the stroke's not.\n\n81\n00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.270\nThe stroke is not changing.\n\n82\n00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.180\nSo don't let that throw you off either.\n\n83\n00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.610\nIt's not the stroke thickness,\nit's something different,\n\n84\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.730\nbut I'm sure you'll get there.\n\n85\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, no, that is exactly\nwhat I was about to mention,\n\n86\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.230\nis, yes that's the diameter of my brush,\nbut is that really my stroke.\n\n87\n00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.490\nI could still also go back\ninto my stroke panel,\n\n88\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.642\nmake that a little bit\nthicker if I wanted to.\n\n89\n00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:02.770\nBut really,\n\n90\n00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.590\nwith the paint brush tool as we were\nkind of joking around, you're liberated.\n\n91\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.880\nYou can go and just kind of paint however\nyou want depending on what you wanna do,\n\n92\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.430\nyada, yada, yada.\n\n93\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.410\nSo it really just depends on the type\nof look that you're going for.\n\n94\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.120\nSo if I want something that feels a little\nbit more natural then I am gonna go with\n\n95\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.240\nthe paintbrush tool.\n\n96\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.375\nAnd again, use those options of the right\nand left brackets to adjust your diameter.\n\n97\n00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:27.950\nUse your stroke,\nI'm just in my black arrow tool now,\n\n98\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.150\nuse your stroke available to\nyou to kinda change that.\n\n99\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.570\nBut with our paint brush, we can also\nstart talking about the brushes panel.\n\n100\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.955\nSo our brushes panel is just gonna be in\nour panel options here or our panels here.\n\n101\n00:04:40.955 --> 00:04:44.210\nAnd I'll actually drag mine out a little\nbit if that's a little bit easier.\n\n102\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.590\nSo you can see,\nokay that's the name brushes there, and\n\n103\n00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.490\nit just looks like a bunch of paint\nbrushes in a bucket, basically.\n\n104\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.410\nAlways if you don't have it, window menu.\n\n105\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.240\nAnd then go down to brushes, so I'm gonna\ngo ahead and paint something here and\n\n106\n00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.930\nthen select it maybe with my black\narrow tool and grab my brushes panel.\n\n107\n00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.260\nNow, we can see we have a couple of\ndifferent options here from a default.\n\n108\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.540\nSo, I can go ahead and\nchoose that charcoal feather.\n\n109\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.680\nAnd what we're gonna do, especially if I\nbump up this stroke way a little bit here,\n\n110\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.260\nso you can see it, it gives it\nthat kind of interesting effect.\n\n111\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.200\nSo this one is kinda nice, because\nit will just do some of the work for\n\n112\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.040\nyou, right, in Illustrator.\n\n113\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.980\nSo you can kinda go ahead and\njust determine what I wanna do.\n\n114\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.550\nAnd that's even just the fun brushes.\n\n115\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.360\nI could've just looked at\nthese options at the top.\n\n116\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.320\nWhich will adjust to just kind of again,\n\n117\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.250\nswitching that diameter\nof the brush that I have.\n\n118\n00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.440\nYou'll see once more of like a flat head.\n\n119\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.404\nThings like that, so you just get\nslightly different effect from there.\n\n120\n00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:40.669\nBut you were not limited to just these\nbrushes, you might be going like yeah,\n\n121\n00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.680\nEmily you made this sound really exciting,\nand\n\n122\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.585\nI only have three different options for\nme.\n\n123\n00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:47.830\n[LAUGH] No, of course you have\nother options that you can use.\n\n124\n00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.070\nAnd that's all gonna be in\nour brush libraries menu.\n\n125\n00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.000\nSo similar to swatch libraries menu,\nright?\n\n126\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.370\nWe're gonna go into that little bottom\nleft-hand corner of our brushes panel.\n\n127\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.940\nWhere I see this little library icon\nthat's pretty standard across other\n\n128\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.210\npanels that have this option.\n\n129\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.660\nI can choose the brush libraries,\nyou can see I can get into arrows.\n\n130\n00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.320\nIf I wanna do arrows,\nspecial maybe, go ahead and\n\n131\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.830\ngrab that, I can do that,\nyou see how it impacted my paint brush.\n\n132\n00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.846\nYou can also see how maybe\nyou could use this for\n\n133\n00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:22.179\nsomething like the line\nsegment tool as well also.\n\n134\n00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:26.010\n&gt;&gt; And this is,\nthe brushes panel is not exclusively for\n\n135\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.360\nthe brush tool, it's really for\nany stroke, any line.\n\n136\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.050\nEven if it's a closed path,\n\n137\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.510\nit's going to be affecting the stroke\nof whatever path you have.\n\n138\n00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.970\nWe're just correlating it together\nbecause brush tool, brushes panel, but\n\n139\n00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.910\ndon't think they are mutually\nexclusive to each other.\n\n140\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.890\nIt's any stroke or fill.\n\n141\n00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.080\nSo, use a line tool, use the arrow.\n\n142\n00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.100\nDraw a square, do the charcoal.\n\n143\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.880\nYou know, those kinds of things.\n\n144\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.652\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Just throwing that out there cuz some\n\n145\n00:06:55.652 --> 00:06:58.650\npeople gonna asked me that like, so\nthis is the only way I can use it?\n\n146\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.110\nNo, you're fine.\n\n147\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.140\nYou can use it on any path.\n\n148\n00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly like Vonne said,\n\n149\n00:07:03.492 --> 00:07:06.792\nwe're kinda linking the two together cuz\nI do think they kind of fit in together.\n\n150\n00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:08.970\nBut you're not limited to it.\n\n151\n00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.360\nSo you'll see here while she was talking\nI did a line segment and used that.\n\n152\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.900\nI did a box basically and\nused that as well.\n\n153\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.040\nSo you also have that\noption available to you.\n\n154\n00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.600\nSo I'm glad you mentioned that.\n\n155\n00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.970\nBut if I go back to my brush tool,\nand I just kind of brush.\n\n156\n00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.805\nI instantly just kind of wanna do\nthis when I have my brush right?\n\n157\n00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:29.190\n[LAUGH] Yeah you just wanna\nget a little curvy right?\n\n158\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.482\nYou can see, you can have pull up some\nof the other options, maybe artistic.\n\n159\n00:07:33.482 --> 00:07:37.510\nI wanna go with something\nlike a watercolor, and so\n\n160\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:43.090\nif I draw something new,\nyou get that kinda watercolor effect.\n\n161\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.098\nSo it can be really nice again,\n\n162\n00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:49.907\nif you are somebody who is inclined in\na little bit more of an artistic way.\n\n163\n00:07:49.907 --> 00:07:53.979\nThis would be a great way to kind of take\nwhat you're doing in the real world and\n\n164\n00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:55.680\nkind of do it in digital format.\n\n165\n00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.879\nYeah, using these in connection\nwith the panels and the brush,\n\n166\n00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:04.929\nnotice if I picked a style of the brush,\nif you wanna say, in the panel first,\n\n167\n00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:10.050\nand then paint it, it's kind of like\nI'm choosing before I paint on.\n\n168\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.130\nOr then going back to\nthe black arrow tool,\n\n169\n00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.290\nselecting that specific path, and\nthen changing the brush after it.\n\n170\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.550\nSo it's kind like which way you're going.\n\n171\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.450\nDraw a bunch and then format or\npick the format and then draw so\n\n172\n00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.340\nit's kinda with the library.\n\n173\n00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.945\nIt's like an artist I have all\nthese brushes in front of me.\n\n174\n00:08:28.945 --> 00:08:30.745\nTake this one out and brush with that.\n\n175\n00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:31.315\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n176\n00:08:31.315 --> 00:08:32.035\n&gt;&gt; It's fun like that.\n\n177\n00:08:32.035 --> 00:08:32.545\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n178\n00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:34.415\nYeah, I can go ahead and\nchoose this first.\n\n179\n00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:35.195\nI want to do that.\n\n180\n00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:38.425\nOr, even if you are working later and\nyou decide you know what,\n\n181\n00:08:38.425 --> 00:08:39.485\nI don't really like that anymore.\n\n182\n00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:40.495\nI want to go back and change that.\n\n183\n00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:42.280\nGo back to your black arrow tool.\n\n184\n00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.830\nAnd you have the ability to maybe\nI want that to be an arrow.\n\n185\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.080\nYou can go ahead and change that there.\n\n186\n00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.120\nSo it's the nice creation versus editing\noption that you typically would have\n\n187\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.830\navailable to you in Illustrator.\n\n188\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.960\nAnd with your brushes panel I would just\nsay this is one of those things where you\n\n189\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.560\nkind of wanna just filter through until\nyou see kind of an idea of what you like.\n\n190\n00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.630\nYou can go through borders.\n\n191\n00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.130\nYou can see how borders would especially\nwork well if you are working on something\n\n192\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:12.110\nmore like a square, decorative banners and\nseals like ooh that sounds kind of fun.\n\n193\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.501\nMaybe I'll see what that does.\n\n194\n00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:17.361\n&gt;&gt; I'm all about a decorative scatter.\n\n195\n00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:20.720\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nI forgot about the decorative scatters.\n\n196\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.796\nYes, you're so right.\n\n197\n00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:27.740\n&gt;&gt; She knows, because when I was teaching\nthis stuff this was always my go-to\n\n198\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.580\nbrush library, and I would always tell\npeople about it just cuz, I don't know,\n\n199\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.025\nI like the bubble, and things like that.\n\n200\n00:09:33.025 --> 00:09:34.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I mean,\n\n201\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.771\nit's funny cuz I totally forgot about it.\n\n202\n00:09:35.771 --> 00:09:37.694\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But she's right, yeah,\n\n203\n00:09:37.694 --> 00:09:39.902\nthere's scatters, I mean, like come on.\n\n204\n00:09:39.902 --> 00:09:42.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How fun is that?\n\n205\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.062\nI can do a fish or stars,\n[LAUGH] I thought it was fish.\n\n206\n00:09:46.062 --> 00:09:46.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.810\n&gt;&gt; Whatever, and\n\n208\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.030\nI think that actually brings\nme to a good point, no,\n\n209\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.102\nthat's something else you can\ndo in another panel, excuse me.\n\n210\n00:09:52.102 --> 00:09:54.327\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, you can enlarge those,\n\n211\n00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:56.093\nbut if you just squint, you'll see.\n\n212\n00:09:56.093 --> 00:09:57.772\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it a thumbnail?\n\n213\n00:09:57.772 --> 00:09:59.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it on the panel options, I think.\n\n214\n00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.920\nIf we go to panel options, nope.\n\n215\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.630\nNever mind.\n\n216\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.295\nWrong pencil.\n\n217\n00:10:04.295 --> 00:10:06.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, we both did that.\n\n218\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.190\n&gt;&gt; So it wasn't just me.\n\n219\n00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.700\nSo you do have the option to\nswitch it to list view, but.\n\n220\n00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.492\n&gt;&gt; But that doesn't work as much.\n\n221\n00:10:12.492 --> 00:10:16.770\n&gt;&gt; No, but we'll get to that exciting\nfeature in a different panel.\n\n222\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.040\nSo that's kind of something that I would\nencourage you just to play around with.\n\n223\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.980\nSee what works best for you but I want to\nkind of move on from the brush tool and\n\n224\n00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.310\nyou can kind of see how that works\nin tandem with the brushes panel,\n\n225\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.530\nat least kind of an introduction\nto the brushes panel,\n\n226\n00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:37.930\nthere are other options with it,\nand moving in to the pencil tool.\n\n227\n00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.600\nSo your pencil tool is actually going\nto be beneath your shaper tool.\n\n228\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.770\nSo we're not going to talk about\nthe shaper tool right now.\n\n229\n00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.470\nIn my opinion,\nI was just explaining this to Vonne,\n\n230\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.410\nbefore class we were talking about it,\nI feel like the shaper tools should be\n\n231\n00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.500\ntheir own category, it shouldn't\neven be linked with these things.\n\n232\n00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.850\nSo we have our pencil tool.\n\n233\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.200\nI'm gonna go ahead and grab that.\n\n234\n00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.760\nSo I'm gonna click and hold on my shaper\ntool which just looks like a circle with\n\n235\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.360\na kind of a pencil coming out of it and\ngrab my pencil tool.\n\n236\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.380\nNow people always ask me what's\nthe difference between my brush tool and\n\n237\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.830\nmy pencil tool.\n\n238\n00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.020\nOne works more like a paintbrush,\none looks more like a pencil.\n\n239\n00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.000\nAnd that's really my explanation for it,\nbecause that's essentially what it does.\n\n240\n00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.730\nSo I grab this.\n\n241\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.360\nYou see, with your pencil tool,\nyou're going to get a thinner line.\n\n242\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.310\nIt's not going to smooth out\nquite like your paintbrush did.\n\n243\n00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.890\nYou can think about, if I was drawing with\na paintbrush, everything would be kind of\n\n244\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:29.700\nSmooth and just kind of align like that,\nwhereas, if I'm doing something with\n\n245\n00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.860\na pencil, you really see all of\nthose options for errors, kind of.\n\n246\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.720\nAnd you kind of see it\na little bit more jagged.\n\n247\n00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.330\nNow, one of the things that the pencil\ntool has made available is this option to\n\n248\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.440\ndo something that's\na little bit more smooth.\n\n249\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.330\nVersus something that's\na little bit more accurate.\n\n250\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.910\nSo what I can do is I can double\nclick on my pencil tool and\n\n251\n00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.970\nI can adjust these settings.\n\n252\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.520\nSay I want it to be really an accurate\ndescription of what I have done.\n\n253\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.950\nSo I can go all the way down to,\nmaybe I wanna make it super accurate.\n\n254\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.500\nGo ahead and hit okay, and\n\n255\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.460\nthen you'll see when I draw you're\ngonna get a lot more points.\n\n256\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.770\nI know we haven't talked about points yet,\nbut\n\n257\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.810\nyou kinda see those\nlittle blue things there.\n\n258\n00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.860\nAnd it's probably not gonna be all that.\n\n259\n00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.235\nI have to say that wasn't terrible.\n\n260\n00:12:11.235 --> 00:12:13.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll give myself a pat on the back.\n\n261\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:19.850\nIt's probably not gonna be as smooth as\nyou would get with the smooth option.\n\n262\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.340\nSo if I just double-click on\nthat pencil tool again and\n\n263\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.130\nmaybe this time just flip\nit all the way to smooth.\n\n264\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.770\nYou can go ahead and\n\n265\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.170\nsee kinda the difference there\nbetween the smooth and the accurate.\n\n266\n00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.120\n&gt;&gt; You can really see it when you let go.\n\n267\n00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.191\nWhen you were drawing it\nlooked kinda jagged and\n\n268\n00:12:34.191 --> 00:12:35.856\nthen when you let go it was like [SOUND].\n\n269\n00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:39.080\nIt smooths itself out\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly, which I never mind\n\n270\n00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.920\na little smoothing for me in Illustrator\nor in all capacities in life you know.\n\n271\n00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.935\nYou may want to go ahead and\nsmooth it out that sounds great.\n\n272\n00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:50.805\nYou know that actually kind\nof transitions nicely, and\n\n273\n00:12:50.805 --> 00:12:52.695\nyou can kinda keep playing\naround with the pencil tool.\n\n274\n00:12:52.695 --> 00:12:57.105\nBut, it transitions as\nnicely into the smooth tool.\n\n275\n00:12:57.105 --> 00:13:00.265\nSo, the smooth tool is going\nto do as the name implies,\n\n276\n00:13:00.265 --> 00:13:02.265\njust kinda smooth things over for you.\n\n277\n00:13:02.265 --> 00:13:06.400\nSo, if for whatever reason you didn't\nhave this option, or even again\n\n278\n00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.240\nthis is why those were, I'm showing you\nthe smooth tool with the pencil tool.\n\n279\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.040\nBut it's not something you specifically\nhave to use with just the pencil tool.\n\n280\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.230\nI can't say it but you can really use\nthe smooth tool for pretty much anything.\n\n281\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.840\nSo I'm going to go and grab that.\n\n282\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.040\nJust again it's kind of\nlinked with the same thing.\n\n283\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.050\nI'm going to click and hold on my pencil\ntool now and grab that smooth tool.\n\n284\n00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.540\nAnd you'll see by just kinda run this over\n\n285\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.780\nwhat it's doing is it's just\nkind of smoothing this out.\n\n286\n00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.457\nAnd the more I do it,\nthe more things will kinda change and\n\n287\n00:13:42.457 --> 00:13:46.658\nadjust and\nget even more kind of smooth if you will.\n\n288\n00:13:46.658 --> 00:13:50.976\n&gt;&gt; I always equate this to like a cake\nscraper to ice and decorate cakes.\n\n289\n00:13:50.976 --> 00:13:51.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to say.\n\n290\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.933\n&gt;&gt; Remember that?\n\n291\n00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:56.940\nAnd so I would take the little cake\nsmoother and you smooth out the icing, and\n\n292\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.310\nthe more you kind of went over it,\nthe smoother it got.\n\n293\n00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.740\nThat's how I remember it.\n\n294\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.790\nBut again, I have a specific memory of\ndecorating cakes for many, many years.\n\n295\n00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did,\n\n296\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.025\nlots of them,\nwedding cakes and everything.\n\n297\n00:14:10.025 --> 00:14:10.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're so fancy,\n\n298\n00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.990\nI can't decorate a normal cake.\n\n299\n00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.571\nI'm just like, this is what\nyou're gonna get, sorry children.\n\n300\n00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:15.242\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n301\n00:14:15.242 --> 00:14:16.290\nI probably wouldn't do it now.\n\n302\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'd just be like,\n\n303\n00:14:17.975 --> 00:14:21.285\nI'm just gonna go up to\nthe grocery store and buy one.\n\n304\n00:14:21.285 --> 00:14:22.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n305\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.720\nBut it is.\n\n306\n00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.510\nIt's especially something that I think\nwill come in handy later when we get into\n\n307\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.580\nPen Tool and\nsome of the more advanced things.\n\n308\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.130\nBut just a good tool to\nhave in your arsenal.\n\n309\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.850\nNow, say [INAUDIBLE] some of this out.\n\n310\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:40.080\nI'm not left with whatever kind\nof wonky mess that I created,\n\n311\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.870\nso I'm really a big fan of that one.\n\n312\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.410\nAnother one that I think is, and we're\ngoing to kind of jump back and forth here\n\n313\n00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.490\ncuz I'm gonna go back to something\nunder that panel, is the Blob Brush.\n\n314\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.035\nI love the Blob Brush.\n\n315\n00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:54.626\nIt's just fun.\n\n316\n00:14:54.626 --> 00:14:55.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n317\n00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:55.990\n&gt;&gt; Blobby.\n\n318\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.930\n&gt;&gt; It's very blobby.\n\n319\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.837\nIt's a fave of mine too.\n\n320\n00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:05.161\n&gt;&gt; In all honestly, I can't say it's\none that I really use a lot, but.\n\n321\n00:15:05.161 --> 00:15:08.600\n&gt;&gt; I I can completely agree with that one.\n\n322\n00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.218\nI don't use it in every day practice but\nI always love teaching it.\n\n323\n00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:13.986\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And showing everybody about\n\n324\n00:15:13.986 --> 00:15:16.052\nit because it's like whoa this is fun.\n\n325\n00:15:16.052 --> 00:15:16.740\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nSo\n\n326\n00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.400\nyour blob tool, it's gonna look a little\nbit more like a blob and we can go here we\n\n327\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.320\nhave that same option that we have\nwith our paintbrush and you all can\n\n328\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.640\nactually see the diameter in this one I\nknow we were talking about that that's\n\n329\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.128\nsomething you have with other paintbrush\noptions and things like Photoshop but\n\n330\n00:15:32.128 --> 00:15:36.360\nwith the blob brush you can see just\nright away how big my diameter is.\n\n331\n00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.840\nYou can see that circle and\nsay okay I know how large that is.\n\n332\n00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.601\nBut again go back to your right and\nleft brackets if you want to go ahead and\n\n333\n00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:45.152\nmake that larger or smaller.\n\n334\n00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:49.663\nAnd then to kind of learn\n\n335\n00:15:49.663 --> 00:15:54.400\nthe brush you just have to\n\n336\n00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.363\nkind of start painting and\n\n337\n00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:04.777\nI can kind of click around and\n\n338\n00:16:04.777 --> 00:16:09.531\nyou see that it's just.\n\n339\n00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:13.610\nIf I kinda paint,\nforgot I have some scatter there.\n\n340\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.550\nThat threw me for a loop.\n\n341\n00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:19.670\nIf I'm just in my regular paint brush and\nI try and link some things together.\n\n342\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.650\nWe all have separate paths.\n\n343\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.110\nThey're all separated out.\n\n344\n00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.760\nBut with my blob brush I can\ncreate a blob, basically.\n\n345\n00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.430\n&gt;&gt; And\nthere's actually one other layer in this,\n\n346\n00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.540\nif you wanna say,\nis it's creating a closed path.\n\n347\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n348\n00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; The other one with the brush,\n\n349\n00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.305\nit's an open path.\n\n350\n00:16:37.305 --> 00:16:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n351\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.990\nit's blobbing together to where\nnow you have this is a fill.\n\n352\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.750\nYou can actually see that\nfrom the control panel.\n\n353\n00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.850\nThe orange is not coming from the stroke.\n\n354\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.200\nIt's coming from the fill.\n\n355\n00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.290\nSo that's another huge difference\nbetween the brush/pencil and\n\n356\n00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.700\nthe blob as the end result.\n\n357\n00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n358\n00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.310\nThat's a great point.\n\n359\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.770\nSo here now I can see I can go ahead and\nchange the fill color.\n\n360\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.850\nYou know whatever I wanna do.\n\n361\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:06.604\nI've seen people do this actually cuz I\nfeel like in some ways it's almost more\n\n362\n00:17:06.604 --> 00:17:09.700\nsimilar to somebody who's\nactually accustomed to painting,\n\n363\n00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.130\nit is a little bit more natural that\neverything would kind of connect, so,\n\n364\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.560\nif you think about I'm painting something,\nand I'm brushing it on top of each other,\n\n365\n00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.960\nyou would think that all\nthose things would connect.\n\n366\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.790\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n367\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.590\nlike right there that looks like some\nweird marshmallow super hero, I'm like,\n\n368\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.690\nyeah, go like that, and\nif you were drawing it like that,\n\n369\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.200\nwould be one whole entity.\n\n370\n00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.590\nThat's your Superman man.\n\n371\n00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.860\nWow!\nOkay.\n\n372\n00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.570\nAnd then, you could go ahead and\nchange the fill,\n\n373\n00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.710\neven add a stroke to that\nbecause now it is a shape,\n\n374\n00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.270\nbut it's almost like a free-form\nshaper tool, in a sense.\n\n375\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n376\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.900\nKind of.\nIt's one of those that I think has more\n\n377\n00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.810\ncapacity than you even really realize.\n\n378\n00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.520\n&gt;&gt; I feel like you hear the word blob and\nyou just think something's not gonna be\n\n379\n00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.958\nreally that effective,\n[LAUGH] but it actually it does.\n\n380\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:06.720\nEspecially again, for those of you who are\naccustomed to a little bit more painting,\n\n381\n00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.090\nnaturally speaking, in the real world.\n\n382\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.920\nSo that's definitely something\nthat I think is fun.\n\n383\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.800\nNow, I want to go back and this is gonna\nkind of take us in a slightly different\n\n384\n00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:21.240\npath here, no pun intended with paths but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just got that.\n\n385\n00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.210\nThat's a good one.\n\n386\n00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.330\n&gt;&gt; I'm so clever.\n\n387\n00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.250\nSo what we're gonna do I\nwanted to mention this\n\n388\n00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.580\neven though this isn't totally\ntied to free hand drawing.\n\n389\n00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.310\nBecause it's kind of linked under\nthe same tool options as our pencil and\n\n390\n00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.930\nour smooth, talking about the join tool.\n\n391\n00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.471\nThe join tool in its nature is gonna\njoin two paths that are kind of close or\n\n392\n00:18:42.471 --> 00:18:45.466\nsomewhat overlapping or\nsomething like that.\n\n393\n00:18:45.466 --> 00:18:51.250\nSo what our join tool does, I'm gonna\nillustrate this with my line segment tool,\n\n394\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.150\nnow I know you're like I thought\nthis was on freehand drawing.\n\n395\n00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.010\nYou could see how it would\napply to that as well.\n\n396\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.500\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\ndo something like this.\n\n397\n00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.500\nAnd the key thing with our join tool, and\n\n398\n00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.990\nthis is something I personally\nalways forget to do.\n\n399\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.650\nI'll go ahead and be honest there.\n\n400\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.820\nIs, you need to select everything\nwith your black arrow tool\n\n401\n00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.840\nbefore you decide you want\nto use the join tool.\n\n402\n00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.130\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nselect all this here.\n\n403\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.380\nAnd then I'm going to grab my join tool.\n\n404\n00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.930\nMy join tool as I mentioned.\n\n405\n00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.020\nPart of the reason why I'm\nlinking it in this video\n\n406\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.900\nis because it's underneath this move tool.\n\n407\n00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.740\nWe're skipping over the path\neraser of that one.\n\n408\n00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.160\nI've just decided I've got to do\nseparately but the join tool here.\n\n409\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.430\nSo I'm clicking in hold.\n\n410\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.910\nIt was all underneath\nthe shaper tool originally.\n\n411\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.800\nAll I'm gonna do is I'm just kind\nof scribble on top of where these\n\n412\n00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.310\nthings connect.\n\n413\n00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.020\nSo if I just kinda scribble up here,\n\n414\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:46.480\nyou're gonna see that it's gonna\nnaturally join those two paths together,\n\n415\n00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.790\nbut it also kinda gets rid of\nsome of that extra information.\n\n416\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.010\nAnd personally I feel like that's where\nthe join tool becomes a little less\n\n417\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.340\nintuitive than some others,\n\n418\n00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.160\ncuz it's not always exactly clear what's\ngonna happen or what's gonna get removed.\n\n419\n00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.840\nYou can guess some idea, but\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n420\n00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.550\nnow that one path, it is not-\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n421\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.820\n&gt;&gt; Grouped, it's not connected.\n\n422\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.190\nYou, like, fused them together.\n\n423\n00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.060\nYou like welded them if you wanna say it.\n\n424\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.940\nIt's one piece now.\n\n425\n00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n426\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:19.075\nSo it is all one individual unit which\nthat would be the benefit of using it.\n\n427\n00:20:19.075 --> 00:20:21.990\nI've talked about the drawbacks what's\nthe benefit of using the join tool?\n\n428\n00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.850\nIt would be any time that you have\nsomething that you really do just need to\n\n429\n00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.790\nconnect for whatever reason.\n\n430\n00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:31.900\nYou know, you can kind of imagine how\nyou might want to close those together.\n\n431\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.920\nSo, likewise, this was all to the work.\n\n432\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.680\nI showed the example of something\nthat was actually overlapping.\n\n433\n00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.050\nIf you have two paths that\nare just kind of close,\n\n434\n00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.670\nnow this one can get a little bit wonky,\nI won't lie.\n\n435\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.220\nIt kind of depends on exactly how\nfar apart they are, you know,\n\n436\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.140\nis one slightly higher than the other.\n\n437\n00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.290\nThings like that.\n\n438\n00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.960\nTo where how much Illustrator's\nreally gonna catch it.\n\n439\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.290\nAt least, that's what I've noticed.\n\n440\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:56.930\nSo, I'm gonna ahead and have two.\n\n441\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:03.000\nThey're just slight off, you can see that\nthey're kind of close together there.\n\n442\n00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.320\nSelect those both my backyard tool,\ngrab my join tool and\n\n443\n00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.800\njust kind of scatter there.\n\n444\n00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.940\nAnd then now you'll see it went ahead and\nadded that v for me and\n\n445\n00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.250\nwent ahead and created, again, one path.\n\n446\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.550\nThe real benefit of the join tool.\n\n447\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.420\nThank you for pointing that out.\n\n448\n00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.204\nAnd we have all our vs for Von.\n\n449\n00:21:21.204 --> 00:21:24.245\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Constant vs, yeah.\n\n450\n00:21:24.245 --> 00:21:26.385\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All for you, so-\n\n451\n00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n452\n00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.360\n&gt;&gt; Really, that's about,\n\n453\n00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.380\nI feel like a good introduction\non freehand drawing.\n\n454\n00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.030\nThere's more that you can do,\nespecially with the brushes panel.\n\n455\n00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.420\nYou can do things like\ncreating your own brushes.\n\n456\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.190\nBut just kind of from an introduction of\nhow to use it and how you might transition\n\n457\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:46.500\nsome of those kind of free hand\ntools that you might be thinking of,\n\n458\n00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.820\nin kind of, a real world\nscenario onto a digital format.\n\n459\n00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.541\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great introduction-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:53.520\n&gt;&gt; -To our digital pencil.\n\n461\n00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And our digital brush, and\n\n462\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.570\nall their different,\nI love that brush panel.\n\n463\n00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I, yeah, you can get really,\n\n464\n00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.325\nreally fun with that and be able to,\nto do all sorts of hearts to your content,\n\n465\n00:22:03.325 --> 00:22:04.415\n[LAUGH] or something like that.\n\n466\n00:22:04.415 --> 00:22:04.924\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n467\n00:22:04.924 --> 00:22:06.614\n&gt;&gt; I always put the hearts as my example,\n\n468\n00:22:06.614 --> 00:22:07.744\nso.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So thank you so\n\n469\n00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:11.124\nmuch for that great introduction to\nour brushes and freehand drawing.\n\n470\n00:22:11.124 --> 00:22:11.954\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n471\n00:22:11.954 --> 00:22:13.630\nwrap this episode up.\n\n472\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.500\nSigning off for CreativeProTV,\nI am your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n473\n00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.240\n&gt;&gt; I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n474\n00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.479\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n475\n00:22:19.479 --> 00:22:23.632\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Liar, liar.\n\n9\n00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:29.993\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n10\n00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:31.909\nI am here to help Ms Emily Ramsey.\n\n11\n00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:32.954\nHi, how are you doing.\n\n12\n00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:34.470\n&gt;&gt; Hey!\nI'm great, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.766\nYes, so we totally just lied to you\nis basically what we are saying.\n\n14\n00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.740\nNo, so Vonne and I,\nwe were talking about this yesterday, and\n\n15\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.050\nkinda going through the Brush tool and\nall that.\n\n16\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.210\nAnd we thought, you know what,\n\n17\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.520\nthere are a couple things we didn't\nmention that could kinda trip you up.\n\n18\n00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.730\nSo we just wanna go through those\ncouple little things, just kind of like\n\n19\n00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.770\nBrush tool, Pencil tool, even Blob brush,\nreally, a little bit more in detail.\n\n20\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz,\nI mean you did a great job introducing it.\n\n21\n00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.135\nAnd then I was like,\n\n22\n00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:05.205\nyou remember when we did the whole\nlike continuing versus new pattern.\n\n23\n00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:05.814\nYes.\n\n24\n00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:10.037\nI'm like, I know cuz that's something\nthat would always freak me out of like,\n\n25\n00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:10.992\nI drew this path.\n\n26\n00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:13.580\nI always do it with\na drawing with flowers.\n\n27\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.370\nWe would draw the stem, and\nthen now you wanna draw a little leaf.\n\n28\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.554\nCuz I was something of obsessed\nwith when I was a kid,\n\n29\n00:01:18.554 --> 00:01:20.052\nlike drawing flowers everywhere.\n\n30\n00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:25.216\nAnd so it's like, why is this leaf not\nbeing a leaf, and the stem went away,\n\n31\n00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:29.600\nand it's just kind of the nature\nof that particular tool.\n\n32\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.200\nAnd so if you're doing it,\n\n33\n00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.611\nwe wanted to go ahead and\nlet you know why and how to avoid it.\n\n34\n00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:36.887\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, right.\n\n35\n00:01:36.887 --> 00:01:40.432\nYou're not doing anything wrong,\nit's just the way that the tool works.\n\n36\n00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:43.670\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nstart in the Pencil tool.\n\n37\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.050\nSo I have that pulled up here.\n\n38\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.780\nNow, couple things we wanted to point out.\n\n39\n00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.230\nI'm gonna attempt this fancy zoom\ntrick that Vonne just taught me.\n\n40\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.880\nIf it all goes awry, I apologize.\n\n41\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.140\nBut, you see how with my Pencil tool,\nI have that pencil and\n\n42\n00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.220\nthen I have kind of\nthe asterisks next to it?\n\n43\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.980\nI'm gonna zoom out.\n\n44\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.590\nI'm gonna attempt, that's the hard part.\n\n45\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.490\nOkay, there we go, we got it.\n\n46\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.400\nSo what we have here is that's pretty much\ngonna show up any time we're creating\n\n47\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.860\na new pencil line, basically.\n\n48\n00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.502\nSo I can here and I'd just be like,\nokay I'm gonna draw.\n\n49\n00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:13.300\nI'm not really a flowers person.\n\n50\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.000\nI'm more of a squiggly lady, so\nwe're gonna do our squiggles.\n\n51\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.900\nAnd we can see, okay, anytime I'm\ndoing a new squiggle, if you will,\n\n52\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.570\nthat's gonna show up\nwith that asterisk there.\n\n53\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.930\nNow, what you'll see here,\nI just kinda hovered over the end of it.\n\n54\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.000\nI didn't even intentionally do this.\n\n55\n00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.110\nAnd when I did that,\nyou'll see I have my asterisk.\n\n56\n00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.560\nOops, I moved other there.\n\n57\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.770\nFrom the asterisk,\nif I kinda go up here to\n\n58\n00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.960\nthat Pencil tool with the straight line,\nthe little diagonal slash there.\n\n59\n00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.670\nI'm gonna zoom out.\n\n60\n00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.067\nIt's like, give me a second here.\n\n61\n00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:47.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Takes a while to get used to it.\n\n62\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n63\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.040\nIt throws you off.\n\n64\n00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.731\nSo what we can do here, now that we see\nwe have that line, it's like, okay,\n\n65\n00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:53.793\nwhat does that mean?\n\n66\n00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:57.784\nThat basically just let's you know,\nwhen you see that icon or\n\n67\n00:02:57.784 --> 00:03:02.890\nthat change to your cursor rather,\nthat's gonna continue on the path.\n\n68\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.230\nIt's not going to create a new one.\n\n69\n00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.890\nSo you kind of have to look out\nanytime you are too close to a path.\n\n70\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.379\nIf I'm trying to start a new one, but\nI'm kinda too close to this old one,\n\n71\n00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.830\nit's automatically just going to kind\nof pick up and adjust that there.\n\n72\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.730\nSo you see, if I go back to my black\nArrow tool, that's all one path,\n\n73\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.440\nit's not two separate ones.\n\n74\n00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.310\nSo that is something that you do wanna\npay attention to with your Pencil tool.\n\n75\n00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.260\nNow, something else that you'll note.\n\n76\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.020\nIf I go here,\nrather than just kind of continuing on,\n\n77\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.810\nI also have the option of kinda\npicking up in the middle.\n\n78\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.515\nSo, I can go here,\nI'm gonna draw a new squiggle, and you see\n\n79\n00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:42.965\nwhere you have all the little points,\nyou see kind of the blue dots here?\n\n80\n00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:45.705\nIf I go and hover over the blue dot and\nget nothing, and\n\n81\n00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:47.265\nthen it's like I have nothing.\n\n82\n00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:50.095\nWhat does that tell me if it's just blank?\n\n83\n00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:54.755\nThat basically let's you know you can\nkind of continue on from that point.\n\n84\n00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:57.845\nSo say I didn't really want\nthis extra stuff on the side,\n\n85\n00:03:57.845 --> 00:03:58.925\nit's like I didn't mean to draw that.\n\n86\n00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.940\nI just want to continue on from here.\n\n87\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.900\nWell, when I see that,\nI can just go ahead and\n\n88\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.040\njust pick it up from really the middle or\nany point of the path.\n\n89\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.752\nSo I can go ahead and do this, and\n\n90\n00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:12.400\nthen be like actually I think\nI'll kinda wrap that down here.\n\n91\n00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.490\nAnd you can go ahead and\ndraw that like that.\n\n92\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.340\nSo it's those little things\nthat we were mentioning that\n\n93\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.040\ncan kind of screw you up with\nthe pencil or the brush or whatever.\n\n94\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and like, in my flower,\nright, that would be the stem.\n\n95\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.403\nAnd then I'd go to draw the leaf,\nand then it would be continue, or\n\n96\n00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:32.840\npicking up at wherever I had had\nthe pencil, and then draw it that way.\n\n97\n00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.050\nAnd it took me a long\ntime to figure that out.\n\n98\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.400\nAnd those little tiny icons are so cute.\n\n99\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.706\nAnd we'll see this back when we go back\ninto the Pen tool or forward, back,\n\n100\n00:04:42.706 --> 00:04:44.560\nwhichever way we're going.\n\n101\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.920\nSo you'll see these slashes and\nthe asterisks which used to be an x.\n\n102\n00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.833\nSo if you hear me referring to it,\nthe pen with an x or the pencil with an x,\n\n103\n00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:55.027\nit used to be an x and\nnow it's an asterisk.\n\n104\n00:04:55.027 --> 00:05:01.340\nBut again, I'm always hearing the history\nlessons of Illustrator [INAUDIBLE].\n\n105\n00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.100\nBut that's something,\n\n106\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.780\nlike you said, that could be really\nmisleading if you were drawing.\n\n107\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.040\nCuz normally, if you're drawing freehand,\nyou're just drawing with a pencil.\n\n108\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.810\nAnd if you want separate paths, you do\nneed to be conscientious about that.\n\n109\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.900\nIt's a minor but important thing.\n\n111\n00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.990\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and delete\nall these, because I want to show you\n\n112\n00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.180\nkind of what this looks like in\nthe Paintbrush tool, excuse me.\n\n113\n00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.690\nWe will notice, okay, actually\nbefore I do that, you'll see, okay,\n\n114\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.260\nwhen I was doing this with my Pencil tool,\nyou can see my Pencil tool,\n\n115\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.110\nas I was creating things,\nit stayed selected.\n\n116\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.960\nSo those blue points showed up for me.\n\n117\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.569\nNow, I kinda want to point that out and\n\n118\n00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.144\nthen show you how that's\ndifferent in the Paintbrush tool.\n\n119\n00:05:43.144 --> 00:05:45.963\nIf I go to the Paintbrush tool,\nand I go like this,\n\n120\n00:05:45.963 --> 00:05:49.180\nyou'll see I still have my\nsame kind of asterisk there.\n\n121\n00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.830\nI still have that option.\n\n122\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.130\nBut what happens is you don't\nsee those little points.\n\n123\n00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.435\nIt's not selecting it.\n\n124\n00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:57.080\nWhy they do that differently,\nI don't know.\n\n125\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.635\nBut what you have to do, you still have\nthe options to kind of continue and\n\n126\n00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:03.804\ngo on like that, but you need to\ngo back to your black Arrow Tool.\n\n127\n00:06:03.804 --> 00:06:09.160\nYou need to select that Paintbrush,\nor that stroke that you did.\n\n128\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.914\nAnd then you have the option\nto kind of continue on.\n\n129\n00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:14.080\nAnd you can see that I went ahead and\ndid that.\n\n130\n00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.570\nIt didn't give me quite the information\nthat the other one did, but\n\n131\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.790\nI still did have that option.\n\n132\n00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.335\nAnd you can see that's all one line now.\n\n133\n00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:23.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that is so weird, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.365\nSo the Pencil, you draw and\nit stays selected.\n\n135\n00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:28.760\nAnd you get those different options.\n\n136\n00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.830\nThe Brush, you draw, let go,\nand then it's not selected.\n\n137\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.540\nSo anytime even if I was trying to draw\nlike the flower and stem, with the Brush,\n\n138\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.340\nit would make a separate path every time,\nit's always starting a new path.\n\n139\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.100\nBut doing the continuing select it.\n\n140\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.460\nSo really, really slight but\nhuge at the same time.\n\n141\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.832\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n142\n00:06:51.832 --> 00:06:52.670\nI totally agree.\n\n143\n00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.610\nAnd so if we go back here,\nwe can see, okay,\n\n144\n00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.130\nI can do that, I create a new line,\nyou see it's not selected.\n\n145\n00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.169\nI need to go back to my black Arrow Tool.\n\n146\n00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.230\nBut again, I still have that option.\n\n147\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.320\nI can go ahead and say, okay,\nI see a little point here.\n\n148\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.920\nThey're kind of hard to\nsee cuz my line is blue.\n\n149\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.500\nMaybe I'll make my line orange or\nsomething like that.\n\n150\n00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.270\nI see that little point here, I can go,\nboop, go ahead and create it from there.\n\n151\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.930\nSo you still have all the same options,\n\n152\n00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.010\njust that weird having to go back to\nmy black Arrow Tool step between it.\n\n153\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:25.720\nAnd you'll see the icons,\nthe cursor with your Paintbrush Tool.\n\n154\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.140\nJust not quite as intuitive as\nthey are with the Pencil Tool.\n\n155\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.650\nThey don't give you as much information.\n\n156\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.560\nSo again, something that we really\njust wanted to point out to you.\n\n157\n00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.350\nNow, to kind of continue on,\n\n158\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.380\nwhat I also wanna look at is\nthat Blob Brush Tool again.\n\n159\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.550\nSo the Blob Brush Tool,\nit's a favorite around here.\n\n160\n00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.360\nWe love it.\n\n161\n00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:52.460\nWe did this and we could kinda see, okay,\nall of that creates one solid grouping.\n\n162\n00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.420\nSo as soon as you're done with your blob,\n\n163\n00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.020\nanytime I add to it,\nit's gonna go ahead and create that.\n\n164\n00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.240\nIt almost turns it from a Stroke\nto a Fill and creates that.\n\n165\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.560\nNow, something that I specifically\nwanted to point out here was that\n\n166\n00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.990\neven if I go back, say I go off and\ndo something else.\n\n167\n00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:14.220\nI'm totally working on something,\nsomething very interesting over here.\n\n168\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.140\nAs long as I stay in that same color,\nwhen I go back to my Blob Brush tool,\n\n169\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.400\nI can always add to this,\nand it's still going to\n\n170\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.740\ncontinue on that path just\nthe same way that it was before.\n\n171\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.520\nNow, slight difference here.\n\n172\n00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.510\nIf I change my color, so if I go to\nblue or something and then try and\n\n173\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.880\nblob over this,\nthen it's not gonna all fuse together.\n\n174\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.360\nThen, it's going to be separate\nin this case Fills, rather.\n\n175\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.930\nSo you can see, okay, that separated out.\n\n176\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.155\nSo, Illustrator really just looks\nat color as a way of saying,\n\n177\n00:08:47.155 --> 00:08:50.290\nokay, if I have orange,\nshe wants all that to be together.\n\n178\n00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.190\nIf I'm doing a separate color, then we're\ngonna go ahead and separate it out.\n\n179\n00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.730\nSo again, just kind of a minor thing, but\nsomething we did want to point out to you.\n\n180\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:02.030\n&gt;&gt; And since we're on a whole selected\nversus not selected in the Blob Brush,\n\n181\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.990\nit does not have to be selected\nbefore you start painting.\n\n182\n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.270\nAs you had shown right there,\nnothing was selected first,\n\n183\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.370\nit was just the same color,\nand the colors overlap.\n\n184\n00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.490\nSo it like fused together and became a\nbigger blob because it was the same color.\n\n185\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.190\nAnd that's where,\n\n186\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.230\nif it was a slightly different orange,\nit wouldn't add together.\n\n187\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.570\nSo it has to be the exact color,\nand then you can go ahead and\n\n188\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.310\nmake your closed path as she's saying for\n\n189\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.305\nthe Fill versus the open path with\nthe Pencil and the Brush, yeah.\n\n190\n00:09:34.305 --> 00:09:37.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have to kind of stop and\n\n191\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.965\nthink which tool because they're so\ndifferent.\n\n192\n00:09:39.965 --> 00:09:40.960\nIt's a little weird.\n\n193\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.445\nI mean, I can see, it's one of those\nlike why did you do that Adobe?\n\n194\n00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:46.805\nBut also there's a reason, well,\n\n195\n00:09:46.805 --> 00:09:50.662\nmaybe sometimes you don't\nwanna continue on the path, so\n\n196\n00:09:50.662 --> 00:09:56.033\nuse the Brush tool cuz they can work very\nsimilar than just lines and everything.\n\n197\n00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:59.098\nSo gives us options,\nit's always good to have options.\n\n198\n00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.199\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, options are good.\n\n199\n00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:03.730\nAnd Illustrator is very good\nat providing you options.\n\n200\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.775\nSo, I don't know how many\nother ways to say it,\n\n201\n00:10:05.775 --> 00:10:08.894\nbut those were just a couple little\nthings we wanted to point out to you and\n\n202\n00:10:08.894 --> 00:10:10.650\nkind of add into that freehand drawing.\n\n203\n00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.078\nSo I think that is it.\n\n204\n00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:15.350\nThere should be no more\ninformation that we add in here.\n\n205\n00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.050\nBut you never know.\n\n206\n00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.278\nSo we're always coming up with stuff.\n\n207\n00:10:17.278 --> 00:10:18.683\nBut thank you, Vonne.\n\n208\n00:10:18.683 --> 00:10:20.464\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Emily.\n\n209\n00:10:20.464 --> 00:10:23.046\nThat was great information to go ahead and\n\n210\n00:10:23.046 --> 00:10:26.150\nappend to what we had\nalready talked about.\n\n211\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.000\nAnd I think this time we\nare done with this tool.\n\n212\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.530\nWe got very in the weeds in this one,\nbut it is for your benefit.\n\n213\n00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.095\nSo hopefully you won't curse our names or\nlike why didn't they tell us this?\n\n214\n00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.651\nWell, we did in this part two.\n\n215\n00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:39.533\nAll right, good.\n\n216\n00:10:39.533 --> 00:10:40.276\nSo we're done.\n\n217\n00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:42.180\nWe are gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n218\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.268\nSigning off for CreativeProTV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith\n\n219\n00:10:45.268 --> 00:10:46.290\n&gt;&gt;

Jazzy.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\n\n14\n00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:45.165\nart board's not always the most\nexciting sounding right.\n\n15\n00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:49.015\nYou're probably thinking why do I really\nwant to watch this when I could do more\n\n16\n00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.085\nfun stuff like color and all that?\n\n17\n00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:53.725\nThe thing about it is art\nboards are just gonna be so\n\n18\n00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:55.635\nuseful to your illustrator work flow.\n\n19\n00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.580\nThat's really where we want to use them.\n\n20\n00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.790\nNow we've said the word art boards before.\n\n21\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.860\nWe've kind of talked about setting up\na new file, setting up art boards.\n\n22\n00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.310\nYour probably at this extent\nthinking that it's kind of just\n\n23\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.400\npages that you would expect in\na program like Microsoft Word.\n\n24\n00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.140\nYou have an eight and a half by 11 page,\nand everything is exactly the same.\n\n25\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.740\nWell, art boards provide so much more\nflexibility in that, which is great\n\n26\n00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.260\nbecause in Illustrator often times we're\nworking with different types of things.\n\n27\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.130\nI'm gonna use the example of a logo, and\n\n28\n00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.080\ndifferent colors, and\ndifferent size, and all that.\n\n29\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.860\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n30\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.099\nI am gonna draw a really,\nreally original logo here.\n\n31\n00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:36.620\nSo we're gonna go ahead and make a circle.\n\n32\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.042\nI am going to make that black.\n\n33\n00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:44.282\nYou'll see I take my fill and\nmy stroke off there, and\n\n34\n00:01:44.282 --> 00:01:47.169\nthen I'm gonna make two\nother little circles.\n\n35\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.685\nUp at the top, never been done\nbefore ladies and gentlemen.\n\n36\n00:01:51.685 --> 00:01:53.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n37\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.660\nwe are going to work with that,\nthat is my logo, very original.\n\n38\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Is that a bear?\n\n39\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.299\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, I know.\n\n40\n00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What could it be?\n\n41\n00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.730\n[LAUGH] I just came up with it on the fly.\n\n42\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.944\nWhat can I say?\n\n43\n00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:08.454\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Million dollars right there.\n\n44\n00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:12.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So this is gonna be my logo,\nand what we're looking at here.\n\n45\n00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.440\nOkay, I have just a typical 8.5 by\n11 art board that we're seeing.\n\n46\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.911\nAnd now, in the example of a logo,\nprobably gonna take up a full 8.5 by 11.\n\n47\n00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:24.498\nAny time I'm trying to use or\n\n48\n00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:28.667\nlater when we're gonna take kind of\nexporting logos out of those images and\n\n49\n00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:32.720\nthings like that, I don't really need\nall this space, so what can I do?\n\n50\n00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.090\nIf I didn't set it up correctly when I was\ndoing my new file or anything like that,\n\n51\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.510\nhow can I kind of change it later?\n\n52\n00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.890\nSo that's really what\nwe're focusing on here.\n\n53\n00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.100\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nwe're gonna start in our Art Board tool.\n\n54\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.370\nSo, I'm gonna go into my toolbar, so\n\n55\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.460\nour art board tool is almost\nall the way at the very bottom.\n\n56\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.750\nIt's just gonna be right above that\nhand marquee and it really just kind of\n\n57\n00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.780\nlooks like a page with two little\nlines coming out the sides of it\n\n58\n00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.670\n&gt;&gt; It's also at the crop tool, yeah.\n\n59\n00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.336\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n60\n00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:05.327\n&gt;&gt; And I know it's kind of a equate\nthe art board tool to the crop tool cuz\n\n61\n00:03:05.327 --> 00:03:10.162\nyou're in a sense cropping out parts but\nis more than just a crop.\n\n62\n00:03:10.162 --> 00:03:12.750\nSo I don't want you to think\nlike that's the crop tool.\n\n63\n00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.190\nNo, we're gonna continue to tell you\nmore about this particular tool but\n\n64\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.710\nthat's how some people kind\nof connect it together.\n\n65\n00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.695\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually that's a good metaphor,\nwhatever we're going to call it.\n\n66\n00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:27.346\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\nThe reason why I do this.\n\n67\n00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:30.909\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nI think that's a good way to put it.\n\n68\n00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.853\nBecause when you look at it,\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n69\n00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:34.400\nselect the dartboard tool now.\n\n70\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.920\nYou kind of get the little\ncrosshairs similar to what you would\n\n71\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.270\nthink of when you think of a cropping.\n\n72\n00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.970\nBut in this case,\nthink of it like we're cropping our page,\n\n73\n00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.500\nwe're not cropping\nthe content of the page.\n\n74\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.840\nYou could if you wanted to.\n\n75\n00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.610\nI'm not making\nthe Mickey Mouse any smaller,\n\n76\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.740\nI'm just making the page\naround it smaller.\n\n77\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.140\nSo what we can do from kind of a basic\nstandpoint, we can look at this.\n\n78\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.360\nI can go here, very similar to\nreally editing a rectangle honestly,\n\n79\n00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.560\nand I can go in the bottom left hand\ncorner and just kind of drag this up.\n\n80\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.110\nAnd get it to be kind of\ncentered around my Mickey Mouse.\n\n81\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.440\nAnd I can just set it up and be okay,\nthat's about what I want it to look like,\n\n82\n00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.540\nthat's about how good size an art\nboard that I'm gonna need.\n\n83\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.850\nNow, you do have some other options here.\n\n84\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.620\nSo we can kind of go ahead and look at our\ncontrol panel, we can see some presets.\n\n85\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.700\nNow mine's set custom right now cuz\nI went ahead and drew something out.\n\n86\n00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.890\nBut what you could do is I could\ngo down here and I could say okay,\n\n87\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.360\nfit to artwork bounds, you know\nthat's great, fit to selected art,\n\n88\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.860\nyada yada yada, but\nyou also have things like letter.\n\n89\n00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.681\nSo if I know I want something to be an 8.5\nby 11, which is really what I had before,\n\n90\n00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:39.776\nbut if I knew i wanted to go back to\nthat for whatever reason, I could.\n\n91\n00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:41.539\nAnd then I could also move\njust right next door.\n\n92\n00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.440\nAnd see where I have this portrait and\nlandscape option?\n\n93\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.530\nI can switch and be like,\nI don't want it like that.\n\n94\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.020\nI want it to be flipped the other way.\n\n95\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.550\nYou don't have to go in and do anything\nfancy to flip it the other way.\n\n96\n00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.730\nAll you have to do is just click this\nbutton, and it's all done for you.\n\n97\n00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.430\nAnd then right next door to that, you guys\nknow the post it note icon at this point.\n\n98\n00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.460\nYou can see that post it note, you can\ngo ahead and grab New art board, and\n\n99\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.560\nI will go ahead and kind of like,\nI don't want to say it hides it at first.\n\n100\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.420\nYou click it, and you don't really\nsee that anything happened, but\n\n101\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.530\nthen once you kind of move your mouse\nover, you can kind of go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.250\nsee okay, great,\nI got that kind of closed on there.\n\n103\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.580\n&gt;&gt; I like that, because I think\nbefore I didn't actually do like the,\n\n104\n00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.010\nI call it ghosting.\n\n105\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.934\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Say hey, you've got something in your\n\n106\n00:05:20.934 --> 00:05:24.813\nhand ready to go ahead and\nput onto the screen or whatever.\n\n107\n00:05:24.813 --> 00:05:28.321\nAnd you would actually have to like draw,\nclick, hold, and drag and\n\n108\n00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:30.560\ndraw the art board to whatever dimension.\n\n109\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.990\nHere it's just like, let's just go ahead\nand put it down and then you can size it,\n\n110\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.820\nso I kind of like the you've got it ready\nto go type imaging if you wanted to say.\n\n111\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.760\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, exactly, it makes it so\nmuch easier that you can kind of just\n\n112\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.095\npick it up and say this is exactly what\nI want and kind of go from there now.\n\n113\n00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:48.365\nSomething else that I want to mention.\n\n114\n00:05:48.365 --> 00:05:51.845\nYou guys are probably not seeing on my\nscreen, well, one thing I should point out\n\n115\n00:05:51.845 --> 00:05:56.035\nyou probably just noticed that I\nx these out to get rid of them.\n\n116\n00:05:56.035 --> 00:06:00.710\nAs I was talking you can go ahead if you\ncreated an art board that you don't want,\n\n117\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.850\njust click on the ex in the top left or,\nI forget my left and rights.\n\n118\n00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.350\n&gt;&gt; The other left., the other left.\n\n119\n00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n120\n00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.077\nSee if you can click on\nthe top right-hand corner.\n\n121\n00:06:11.077 --> 00:06:14.912\nYou can go ahead and click on that and\nsay okay, I don't need that for\n\n122\n00:06:14.912 --> 00:06:16.230\nwhatever reason.\n\n123\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.070\nNow the thing that I mentioned about what\nyou guys are probably seeing on your\n\n124\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.600\nscreen, but\nmay not necessarily be seeing on mine.\n\n125\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.660\nSo my resolution is\nadjusted slightly on this.\n\n126\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.340\nBut you can see, you guys can see\nmy screen a little bit better, but\n\n127\n00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.100\nwhat you probably have over here,\nsomething like width and height.\n\n128\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.710\nSo if you wanted to go ahead and\nset specific dimensions, you can say okay,\n\n129\n00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.930\nI need a specific width here and\na specific height there.\n\n130\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.620\nSo that is also an option that\nyou have available to you.\n\n131\n00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.840\nBut what I'm gonna go back here is\nI'm just gonna kind of go back to,\n\n132\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.640\nmaybe, we'll just draw this around.\n\n133\n00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.690\nWe don't need to fit to selected anything.\n\n134\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.920\n&gt;&gt; And I like to sometimes\nif I'm using an art board to\n\n135\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.965\nkind of get the white\nspace around the logo.\n\n136\n00:07:00.965 --> 00:07:05.752\nThis is the art, and\nI want this amount of white around it,\n\n137\n00:07:05.752 --> 00:07:10.370\nso that's kind of why I will go and\nresize the art board.\n\n138\n00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.248\nBecause later when we talk about\nexporting files, the art board size does\n\n139\n00:07:15.248 --> 00:07:20.440\nmake a huge difference on when you're\ngoing to be finishing all of your stuff,\n\n140\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.708\nso that's why this is important\nto know about the size, per se.\n\n141\n00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:29.451\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, exactly, and another\noption you do have for size for instance.\n\n142\n00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:32.005\nSince you're kind of like me and\nyou're not seeing that width and\n\n143\n00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:33.795\nheight option available to you.\n\n144\n00:07:33.795 --> 00:07:36.675\nIf you click on this button right here,\nit kind of looks like a page with some\n\n145\n00:07:36.675 --> 00:07:39.755\nbullets on it,\nyou have your art board options.\n\n146\n00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:41.585\nThat is also a place where\nyou could go ahead and\n\n147\n00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:45.595\neither see what size you created if\nyou just kind of were dragging and\n\n148\n00:07:45.595 --> 00:07:49.795\ndrawing like that, or you can actually\nenter in a specific width and height.\n\n149\n00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:53.523\nIf I was trying to be really exact here,\nlike you said, sometimes it can really\n\n150\n00:07:53.523 --> 00:07:56.930\nmake a different and then that's\nprobably what I would go ahead and do.\n\n151\n00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.759\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's a lot of times where\nI'm actually having to design maybe\n\n152\n00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.277\na logo or maybe a flyer.\n\n153\n00:08:03.277 --> 00:08:07.211\nI need to do it in a regular page size,\nand a half page size, and\n\n154\n00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:08.900\na quarter page size.\n\n155\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.540\nSo, before,\nI just would make multiple files.\n\n156\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.190\nWell, now, I'll just go ahead and\nmake multiple art boards.\n\n157\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.635\nSo I have full page,\nhalf page, quarter page.\n\n158\n00:08:18.635 --> 00:08:22.210\nOr web banner size one,\nweb banner size two,\n\n159\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.260\nand it's just all in one place and\nthat's why I really love Art Board.\n\n160\n00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.360\nCuz it's right here when\nyou're what size may it be,\n\n161\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.620\nthat could be why you\nwant specific dimensions.\n\n162\n00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.970\nRather than the first way where\nwe just kind of visualizing it,\n\n163\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.140\nbut I just want visual white space\naround this selected artwork.\n\n164\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, great example.\n\n165\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.160\nSometimes you will need those\nspecific dimensions, but for\n\n166\n00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.840\nright now I'm just going to go ahead and\ncreate a couple artboards.\n\n167\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.200\nNow I could have these all the same size.\n\n168\n00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.110\nPart of the reason why I have them\ndifferent sizes is just to illustrate\n\n169\n00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.850\nto you that you don't have to\nhave them all the same size.\n\n170\n00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.300\nExactly what she was just saying.\n\n171\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.230\nYou can do something [INAUDIBLE] and\nsomething half that, yada, yada, yada.\n\n172\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.605\nSo I'm gonna stick with just these three,\n\n173\n00:09:02.605 --> 00:09:06.475\nand then we will see here is we can\ngo ahead and give these a name.\n\n174\n00:09:06.475 --> 00:09:08.565\nNow mine because I've\nkind of created some and\n\n175\n00:09:08.565 --> 00:09:10.595\ndeleted them; you see I\nhave this artboard six.\n\n176\n00:09:10.595 --> 00:09:13.442\nAnd you're thinking okay, but\nwe only have three art boards on the page.\n\n177\n00:09:13.442 --> 00:09:17.154\nThat's just because it went ahead and\nnamed it based on how many I created and\n\n178\n00:09:17.154 --> 00:09:18.557\nhave deleted at this point.\n\n179\n00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:22.392\nSo, what we can do, we can go ahead and\ngive it a name here, or later we can give\n\n180\n00:09:22.392 --> 00:09:26.530\nit a name in our art board panel,\nwhich we're gonna talk about in a second.\n\n181\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.160\nBut I'm just gonna kinda leave these\nbe and then what you'll see here,\n\n182\n00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.090\nnow in my case I'm working\non the example of the logo.\n\n183\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.230\nLet's say for example,\n\n184\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:39.660\nI wanted to reproduce this Mickey logo\nin a variety of different colors.\n\n185\n00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.060\nSo that maybe something that you\nmay need to do for your company,\n\n186\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.650\nyou might have a black and\nwhite for example.\n\n187\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.410\nYou may have a full color version;\na one color version, things like that.\n\n188\n00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.030\nSo, what we're going to do,\nI'm going to go ahead and select this and\n\n189\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:55.640\nthen something that Vonne taught me\nis that I can actually copy this.\n\n190\n00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:00.902\nSo I'm gonna either just do my edit menu,\ncopy, or I'm gonna do command or\n\n191\n00:10:00.902 --> 00:10:05.260\nCtrl+C on my keyboard, and\nthen a cool thing that you can do.\n\n192\n00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.540\nI can go into my edit menu again and\n\n193\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.650\nI can go all the way down\nto paste on all artboards.\n\n194\n00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.630\nThis was life changing for me.\n\n195\n00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.150\nIt's a real time saver.\n\n196\n00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.900\nSo I can go ahead and just choose that\nagain, edit, place on all art boards.\n\n197\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.890\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nre-create that there.\n\n198\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we were actually\ntalking about this off-camera.\n\n199\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.080\nAnd it's one of those, I didn't know\nit was there for the longest time.\n\n200\n00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.283\nSo I was copy and\npaste multiple times and all, Alt+drag.\n\n201\n00:10:32.283 --> 00:10:32.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n202\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.450\n&gt;&gt; And then I saw it,\nI'm like my gosh, really?\n\n203\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.262\nYeah, so\nit happens to the best of us [LAUGH].\n\n204\n00:10:40.262 --> 00:10:44.128\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\n[LAUGH] life changing let me tell you.\n\n205\n00:10:44.128 --> 00:10:48.180\nSo I'm gonna go through here and\nI'm just going to change the color.\n\n206\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.790\nNow, well, you'll notice when\nI click on each art board,\n\n207\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.390\nyou'll see it's pretty subtle but\nit's just a slight black outline.\n\n208\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.500\nYou may not even necessarily be able to\nsee it on my screen, it's so subtle, but\n\n209\n00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.640\nyou can probably see it at home on yours.\n\n210\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.750\nWhen I have that black outline, it's just\nkind of something art board in focus.\n\n211\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.923\nIt's basically just a way of Illustrator\nletting me know that this is the art\n\n212\n00:11:08.923 --> 00:11:10.072\nboard that I am working on.\n\n213\n00:11:10.072 --> 00:11:14.041\n&gt;&gt; And this has happened to me a bunch\nof times where I think I am on one\n\n214\n00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:18.220\nart board and I do my short zoom in and\nzoom out and where am I?\n\n215\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.060\nI'm in a different art board\nthat's in focus or selected,\n\n216\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.600\nhowever you want to say it.\n\n217\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.940\nAnd I thought I was on the other one.\n\n218\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.590\nSo it's that whole you're going faster\nthan the computer in a sense and\n\n219\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.550\nyou forgot to tell the computer no,\n\n220\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.972\nthis is the art board I want to zoom in,\nnot that one.\n\n221\n00:11:34.972 --> 00:11:37.279\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it's very small but\n\n222\n00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:41.910\nit can really mess you up\nlike it does to me [LAUGH].\n\n223\n00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.440\n&gt;&gt; Zooming, especially, yes.\n\n224\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.636\nIs where that comes in handy.\n\n225\n00:11:44.636 --> 00:11:45.500\nYou're like, why?\n\n226\n00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.700\nWhy am I going over here?\n\n227\n00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.220\nYes [LAUGH], so what I'm gonna do,\n\n228\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.010\nI'm just gonna kind of\nhaphazardly center these in here.\n\n229\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.450\nAnd maybe since these are a little bit\nlarger, i'll make a slightly bigger logo.\n\n230\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.580\nAnd then as I mentioned, I'm gonna go\nahead and just change the colors, just,\n\n231\n00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.270\nagain, so\nyou guys can see another use for this.\n\n232\n00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.800\nSo maybe I'll make this one all pink,\ncuz we can have a pink Mickey.\n\n233\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.730\nWhy not?\n\n234\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.070\nAnd then I'll make this one all orange.\n\n235\n00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.745\nI feel like those\nare the go tos every time.\n\n236\n00:12:10.745 --> 00:12:12.060\n[LAUGH] Pink and orange.\n\n237\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.700\nAnd so now what we're gonna do is we\nare gonna look at how this impacts our\n\n238\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.330\nart board panel.\n\n239\n00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.000\nSo I'm going to go, if you don't already\nhave it, in your window menu, and\n\n240\n00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.910\ngrab the art boards panel.\n\n241\n00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.540\nAnd we can see, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust detach this and pull it up,\n\n242\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.990\njust cuz this feels so lonely down there.\n\n243\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.760\nWhat we have, we have art board one,\nart board five, and art board six.\n\n244\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.900\nThose are those names\nthat you saw earlier.\n\n245\n00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.820\nWell now what I'm gonna do,\nI wanna go ahead and rename these.\n\n246\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.740\nI could have done this when I was creating\nmy art boards in my art board tool, but\n\n247\n00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.690\nI can also do it here.\n\n248\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.530\nSo what I need to do is I need to\ndouble click on the name itself.\n\n249\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.520\nDon't try and\ndouble click off to the side.\n\n250\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.870\nDouble click on the actual words.\n\n251\n00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.770\nAnd you can see not only is it\ngonna bring that one in focus.\n\n252\n00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.620\nBut it also gives you\nthe opportunity to name it.\n\n253\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.520\nSo I'll call this Original Mickey.\n\n254\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.120\nAnd then I'll double click on Art Board 5,\nagain on the words.\n\n255\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.330\nCall this Pink Mickey.\n\n256\n00:13:05.575 --> 00:13:09.980\nAnd then double-click on art-board six,\nand I will call that one orange Mickey.\n\n257\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.810\nNow you will see that time\nit did not highlight.\n\n258\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.740\nI think it just had to do\nwith specifically where\n\n259\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.780\nI clicked that first time.\n\n260\n00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.580\nIf you kind of click off to the side,\nthat is what is going to take you there.\n\n261\n00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.230\n&gt;&gt; I think on the number.\n\n262\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.325\nIf you click right on the number.\n\n263\n00:13:19.325 --> 00:13:23.834\nNumber, I think that's the one that\nselects or moves or no nevermind.\n\n264\n00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:26.325\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wrong program.\n\n265\n00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:33.245\n[LAUGH] It's okay,\nI've got the computer so I can test it.\n\n266\n00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:38.505\nWhat we're looking at here is we\nhave that orignal pink and orange.\n\n267\n00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:40.995\nI'm gonna zoom out so\nwe can look at these all again.\n\n268\n00:13:40.995 --> 00:13:41.680\nNow.\n\n269\n00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.880\nWhy does the artboard\npanel make a difference?\n\n270\n00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.520\nSo you're probably thinking, okay, great.\n\n271\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.030\nI could've done that in my artboard tool.\n\n272\n00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.260\nWhatever.\n\n273\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.550\nThe thing about it is with our artboard\npanel you see this one, two, three?\n\n274\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:59.330\nThat's letting us know that the order how\nour artboards are really going to save or\n\n275\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:13:59.880\nexport.\n\n276\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.660\nSo even if I were to go in my artboard.\n\n277\n00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.290\nArt board tool again and\nkind of rearrange these so\n\n278\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.850\nthat it looked like something like this.\n\n279\n00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.640\nWhat you're going to see\nin my art board panel,\n\n280\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.390\nthat original Mickey is still number one,\nso even though\n\n281\n00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.610\nyou may be thinking okay this is going\nto save kind of from left to right.\n\n282\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.580\nHow you would expect it to, original\nMickey is still going to be number one\n\n283\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.260\nPDF specifically, you're gonna see\nthat original black Mickey first.\n\n284\n00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.380\nNow what can I do about this?\n\n285\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:35.840\nObviously, you can't always just go off of\nthe same order that you created something,\n\n286\n00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.040\nwhich is how this is being made.\n\n287\n00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.350\nI made the orignal Mickey first,\nand then the others.\n\n288\n00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.430\nSo what you can actually do is,\nyou can drag and drop these.\n\n289\n00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.840\nSo If I want to go in the order\nthat I see from left to right.\n\n290\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.920\nHere pink original and then orange.\n\n291\n00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.480\nWhat I can do is I can just drag and\ndrop this.\n\n292\n00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.800\nKind of like what we did with our layers.\n\n293\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.430\nAnd you can see as I drag and\n\n294\n00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.290\ndrop that original Mickey layer\nI have that blue line there.\n\n295\n00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.320\nAnd that will go ahead and\nlet me know, okay, I kinda drop that.\n\n296\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.080\nYou're not gonna see any sort of change\nhere, but if I were go into a file\n\n297\n00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.550\nsave as and save as a PDF, you would see\nthat the order would be impacted there.\n\n298\n00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.260\nSo I really think that's.\n\n299\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.830\nIt for art boards.\n\n300\n00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.320\nAt least to get you guys to a kind\nof understanding of how they work.\n\n301\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.707\nYou can do some things like adding\na bleed and stuff like that, but\n\n302\n00:15:23.707 --> 00:15:25.877\nwe'll talk about those all separately.\n\n303\n00:15:25.877 --> 00:15:29.470\nSo, I think that's it,\nthat should give you a good introduction.\n\n304\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes, like you said,\nnot the most exciting tool,\n\n305\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.500\nbut when you start getting\nreally into design stuff and\n\n306\n00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.650\nyou have a project that you have\nmultiple iterations of the same thing.\n\n307\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.260\nIt actually becomes quite awesome to you.\n\n308\n00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.250\nThat's colorful but super useful and\n\n309\n00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.190\nit makes your life a lot easier,\nand that's always a good thing.\n\n310\n00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.490\nSo thank you so much for that, that was\nawesome and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n311\n00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.450\nwrap this episode up, so\nsigning off for Creative Pro TV,\n\n312\n00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.150\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n313\n00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.070\n&gt;&gt; And Emily Ramsey.\n\n314\n00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.851\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n315\n00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:06.459\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to\nanother edition of Creative Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:20.594\nI am your host Vonne Smith, and we're\ncontinuing on with Illustrator 2017 CC.\n\n5\n00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:24.120\nI think I just flipped those around, but\nyou know what, you know where we're at.\n\n6\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.107\nWe're in Illustrator.\n\n7\n00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:28.037\n[LAUGH] And here to help us with\nour episode that we're doing,\n\n8\n00:00:28.037 --> 00:00:29.940\nand I honestly forgot we were gonna do.\n\n9\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.437\nSo Emily, why don't you help me\nsay what we're gonna do, welcome.\n\n10\n00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:34.249\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let me tell you, yes.\n\n11\n00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:35.435\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.219\n&gt;&gt; Let me tell you all about it, Vonne.\n\n13\n00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.238\nWe are doing object transformations.\n\n14\n00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:44.064\nAnd the reason Vonne can't remember, is\nbecause we had a hard time titling this.\n\n15\n00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:45.799\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We did.\n\n16\n00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:46.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.690\nIt's just kind of some things that like,\nyes you can use them to transform objects.\n\n18\n00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.380\nBut they're kind of\njust things that again,\n\n19\n00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.730\nmake your life a lot easier\nwhen working with Illustrator.\n\n20\n00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.579\n&gt;&gt; It was one of those we didn't really\nwanna title it eyedropper transformation,\n\n21\n00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.511\ntool end panel, and rounding corners.\n\n22\n00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:03.571\nThat's a really long title.\n\n23\n00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:06.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So object transformation here we are.\n\n24\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.343\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n25\n00:01:07.343 --> 00:01:09.071\nIt's a little more succinct for you there.\n\n26\n00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:09.783\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:11.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what we are going to be doing?\n\n28\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.940\nWe're gonna be talking about\nthe Eye Dropper tool, which is awesome.\n\n29\n00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.900\nAnd then we're gonna get a little bit\nmore into the transformed panel and\n\n30\n00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.490\nthe options that you can do there,\nthat are a little bit different from\n\n31\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.350\njust the regular transformations\nthat we've been doing.\n\n32\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.640\nAnd then also kind of round some corners.\n\n33\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.530\nWe'll talk a little about\nthe transformed tool at the end as well.\n\n34\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.785\nBut I really wanna go ahead and\nget started with the Eye Dropper tool,\n\n35\n00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:37.170\nbecause is my favorite of all\nthe things that we're discussing today.\n\n36\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.716\nSo the Eye Dropper tool, what it does?\n\n37\n00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:45.226\nIt basically just gonna copy appearance\nattributes from one object to the other.\n\n38\n00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:48.712\nSo let's say we're working on something\nand I go ahead, I've pulled this up here.\n\n39\n00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:52.300\nYou don't need this by any means,\nI just wanna use it for example's sake.\n\n40\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.590\nWe have some texts that\nI've already formatted and\n\n41\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.770\nthen I have just a generic shape\nthat I've already formatted as well.\n\n42\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.560\nSo let's say,\nwe'll start of with the example of texts.\n\n43\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.131\nI am working on some texts in my document,\n\n44\n00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:08.840\nwouldn't be that unusual if I was working\non a flyer or something like that?\n\n45\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.956\nThat if I had some other text,\nlike I can go ahead and call this-\n\n46\n00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:13.458\n&gt;&gt; Other text.\n\n47\n00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:14.379\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n48\n00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.491\nIt's like sample two,\nI don't know, other text.\n\n49\n00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:19.950\nI have this down here.\n\n50\n00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.290\nWhat I could do, if I wanted to be,\nI don't wanna take the long way.\n\n51\n00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.774\nI could go back into my character panel.\n\n52\n00:02:26.774 --> 00:02:29.913\nI could go ahead and give this the font\nthat I used, and I could go and\n\n53\n00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:31.386\nchoose the color and all that.\n\n54\n00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:33.321\nI could also make my life a lot easier and\n\n55\n00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:35.450\nI could do this using\nthe Eye Dropper tool.\n\n56\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.930\nSo all I have to do,\nI have this other text selected.\n\n57\n00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.600\nWhatever I want to be transformed is\nselected, and then I need to go ahead and\n\n58\n00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.718\ngrab my Eye Dropper tool.\n\n59\n00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:47.712\nMy Eye Dropper tool just looks\nlike the eyedropper on my toolbar,\n\n60\n00:02:47.712 --> 00:02:51.770\nkind of hard to explain where this one is.\n\n61\n00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.470\nIt's kind of in the lower third,\nif you will, but\n\n62\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.510\nit's I think a little bit\nmore obvious of an icon.\n\n63\n00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.320\nSo it looks like the Eye Dropper,\nand I think the hot key for\n\n64\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.740\nthat was just the letter i.\n\n65\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.110\nSo if you wanna go ahead and\nuse that, you also can.\n\n66\n00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.814\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nuse my Eye Dropper tool, grab that.\n\n67\n00:03:06.814 --> 00:03:10.970\nAnd then now what I'm gonna do, so\nsimple and stupid, you can go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.339\njust a single click on whatever\nformatting you wanna copy.\n\n69\n00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.486\nSo in my case I wanna copy this,\nI'm gonna single click on that.\n\n70\n00:03:17.486 --> 00:03:21.034\nAnd what you will notice one thing I do\nwanna point out with text specifically,\n\n71\n00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.663\nyou're gonna see I got that Eye Dropper\ntool, but then I also have a T next to it.\n\n72\n00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:28.185\nAnd that just lets me know that I'm\ncopying the actual text formatting,\n\n73\n00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:31.592\nrather than just the color which is\nsomething that we can kinda see when\n\n74\n00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:32.820\nwe get into our objects.\n\n75\n00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.620\nSo I'm actually copying\nthe text formatting, and\n\n76\n00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.010\nI can see that because I have\nthat little T letting me know.\n\n77\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.370\nThat's just when I'm hovering over it.\n\n78\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.120\nAnd when I single click,\nall of that's done for me.\n\n79\n00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.980\n&gt;&gt; This is something that,\nI knew about the Eye Dropper tool.\n\n80\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.332\nI had no idea, honestly,\nall the way up until this point,\n\n81\n00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:53.165\nI had no idea that you\ncould do that with text.\n\n82\n00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:56.452\nAnd it was really just before\nthis episode, I'm just like, no.\n\n83\n00:03:56.452 --> 00:03:58.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are you serious?\n\n84\n00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.641\nIt blew my mind,\nbecause I did not that was possible.\n\n85\n00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.001\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So I am very happy today.\n\n86\n00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:09.781\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad that it can just really bring\n\n87\n00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:10.393\nyou joy.\n\n88\n00:04:10.393 --> 00:04:10.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.357\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, I mean,\n\n90\n00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:17.726\nthat it's such a simple thing, but\nit really makes a huge difference.\n\n91\n00:04:17.726 --> 00:04:20.411\nAnd the cool thing about\nthe Eye Dropper tool is that,\n\n92\n00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:23.824\nyou're not really limited to just\none thing that you can use it for.\n\n93\n00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:26.017\nSo we used it for text.\n\n94\n00:04:26.017 --> 00:04:30.220\nWhat if I wanted some shapes,\nlike I wanted to go ahead and\n\n95\n00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.732\ndraw a square here, or\neven I can draw a circle.\n\n96\n00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:37.223\nIt doesn't have to be exactly\nthe same type of shape, but\n\n97\n00:04:37.223 --> 00:04:40.226\nI still wanted to copy\nthat general formatting.\n\n98\n00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:44.061\nAgain, there's appearance attributes,\nwhat I could do I could go ahead and\n\n99\n00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:46.545\nselect this thing,\nbe like I want that to be pink.\n\n100\n00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:50.841\nBut I'm too lazy to go through,\nI'm more efficient than going through and\n\n101\n00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:55.154\nactually choosing those colors,\nchanging my stroke weight and all that.\n\n102\n00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:59.792\nI can select that shape that I want to be\ntransformed, grab my Eye Dropper tool,\n\n103\n00:04:59.792 --> 00:05:01.395\ngo ahead and click on this.\n\n104\n00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:03.891\nAnd you'll see it copies\nall that formatting for me.\n\n105\n00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:08.213\nVonne's shaking her head in\npure amazement over here.\n\n106\n00:05:08.213 --> 00:05:09.375\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n107\n00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:12.359\nthis was before I knew that\nthe Eye Dropper tool exists for\n\n108\n00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:13.802\nthis particular example.\n\n109\n00:05:13.802 --> 00:05:16.676\n&gt;&gt; It always go back to that one shape,\ngo up and look, and\n\n110\n00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:20.563\nlike remember okay it's this color,\nit's this weight and everything.\n\n111\n00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:24.341\nSo this is so\nmuch easier than going back and doing it.\n\n112\n00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:27.694\nSo it's the copy format, it's like\nan Excel or any Microsoft products.\n\n113\n00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:31.312\nYou can paste special or\npaste formatting only, so\n\n114\n00:05:31.312 --> 00:05:34.099\nits kind of a copy paste and that's it.\n\n115\n00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually is right?\n\n116\n00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:40.539\nAnd you are right, its so much easier than\nhaving to remember I did 17 points here I\n\n117\n00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.053\nneed to go ahead and do that.\n\n118\n00:05:42.053 --> 00:05:45.352\nSo I'm just gonna do this again,\nso you can see the beauty of it.\n\n119\n00:05:45.352 --> 00:05:47.152\nAnd I'm gonna select that circle,\n\n120\n00:05:47.152 --> 00:05:50.574\nit does not have to be the same type\nof shape I can go ahead and do that.\n\n121\n00:05:50.574 --> 00:05:53.298\nAnd I can select that as well.\n\n122\n00:05:53.298 --> 00:05:57.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but the biggest key is that you\nhave to select the object that you want to\n\n123\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.940\nhave the formatting applied to.\n\n124\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.374\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Have that selected and then go out and\n\n125\n00:06:03.374 --> 00:06:06.006\npick the thing that is the copy.\n\n126\n00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:09.223\nSo that step, sometimes I think\npeople wanna do it backwards,\n\n127\n00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:12.088\nselect the thing that you\nwant the formatting to apply.\n\n128\n00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:13.061\nNope, the other way.\n\n129\n00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:15.109\nYeah, and this, I, yeah.\n\n130\n00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:16.326\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No,\n\n131\n00:06:16.326 --> 00:06:20.176\nI have made that mistake myself, and then\nI'll be mad, because then it's like you\n\n132\n00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:22.710\nlose the formatting that you\nactually wanted to copy.\n\n133\n00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.005\nOf course, we all know\nan Illustrator you can command or\n\n134\n00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:29.934\ncontrol Z as in zebra to undo which\nis actually what I just did here,\n\n135\n00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:34.092\nto save your life, but yes,\nit definitely can cause some confusion.\n\n136\n00:06:34.092 --> 00:06:37.900\nNow there are some other things that\nI wanna point out, what if I wanted,\n\n137\n00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.781\nI had this square here, but then I wanted\nto copy just the pink of the text.\n\n138\n00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:45.249\nSay, you had that some sort of specialty\ncolor and you didn't have the swatch for\n\n139\n00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:48.209\nthat whatever, I could go ahead in\nhere and I could do the same thing.\n\n140\n00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:50.030\nBut I'm only gonna copy the color.\n\n141\n00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.810\nSo don't think that you're\nlimited from just text to text or\n\n142\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.410\nobject to object,\nyou can do it kinda cross.\n\n143\n00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.840\n&gt;&gt; And I did notice on the square now,\nit doesn't have the same stroke.\n\n144\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.580\nIt copied the fill and\nthe stroke of the text,\n\n145\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.189\ncuz of course you can\nhave stroke on a text.\n\n146\n00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:11.347\nSo it's not like,\nI wanna keep the orange stroke,\n\n147\n00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:14.451\nbut now change the fill of that.\n\n148\n00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:17.580\nI can't remember if there's options for\nit, is there-\n\n149\n00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.415\n&gt;&gt; I think that you can hold down-\n\n150\n00:07:19.415 --> 00:07:21.463\n&gt;&gt; Yes, as soon as I started talking,\n\n151\n00:07:21.463 --> 00:07:26.261\nI'm like, wait, I know there's some key or\nmodifier that I could hold to do that.\n\n152\n00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:26.956\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, so.\n\n153\n00:07:26.956 --> 00:07:27.989\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you for reminding me.\n[LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:30.133\n&gt;&gt; You are actually bringing me to my next\n\n155\n00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:33.014\npoint, where you can start\nto get fancy with this,\n\n156\n00:07:33.014 --> 00:07:35.430\nis in one case holding\ndown your shift key.\n\n157\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.678\nSo in this case, if I have this\nwith just to the fill color, but\n\n158\n00:07:38.678 --> 00:07:42.625\nI wanted to keep that stroke, which\nis exactly what Vonne was mentioning.\n\n159\n00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.860\nWhat I can do when I\nhave my Eye Dropper tool?\n\n160\n00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.340\nHold down my Shift key.\n\n161\n00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.468\nIf I hold down my Shift key and then\nselect that, just gonna copy that fill.\n\n162\n00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:54.778\nSo it can be kind of nice if you do\nwanna keep that for whatever reason, and\n\n163\n00:07:54.778 --> 00:07:56.484\nyou can go ahead and do that.\n\n164\n00:07:56.484 --> 00:07:59.203\nNow the Shift key also\nhas some other uses.\n\n165\n00:07:59.203 --> 00:07:59.803\nWhat we can do.\n\n166\n00:07:59.803 --> 00:08:02.570\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndelete these bad boys here.\n\n167\n00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.798\nWe haven't necessarily\ntalked about gradients, or\n\n168\n00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:07.626\nI don't think we have in the order\nthat we're gonna present these.\n\n169\n00:08:07.626 --> 00:08:12.530\nBut we have some gradient swatches\nthat I want to go ahead and pull from.\n\n170\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.420\nSo even if you don't know what\na gradient is, you can go ahead and\n\n171\n00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.320\njust pull out one of these swatches.\n\n172\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.180\nAnd it's basically these ones at\nthe end where we have the color\n\n173\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.700\nfading into another color.\n\n174\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.510\nSo I'm just gonna select this one\nwith the two different oranges there.\n\n175\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.490\nNow say I have another shape,\n\n176\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.700\nwe're gonna pretend that that didn't have\nthat formatting, that was just black.\n\n177\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.090\nAnd what we can do here,\n\n178\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.400\nsay I wanna copy this formatting but\nI don't wanna copy the whole gradient.\n\n179\n00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.790\nI'm really only want to copy like\none color or something specifically.\n\n180\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.800\nWhat I can do,\nI can take my eye drop or tool, and\n\n181\n00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.860\nagain, we're gonna use that Shift key.\n\n182\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.400\nI can hold Shift, select a color, and\n\n183\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.410\nit's just gonna specifically\nselect that one color.\n\n184\n00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.920\nNow if I remember correctly I think\nit will, no, actually it does.\n\n185\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.660\nI was gonna say I think it only selects\nthe specific two colors used in\n\n186\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.320\nthe gradient, which will make sense\nwhen we get into gradients, but\n\n187\n00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.846\nit will select really kind of any\nof the colors in between, so yeah.\n\n188\n00:09:04.846 --> 00:09:09.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you were reading my mind because\nwith gradients, you have a gradient ramp\n\n189\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.380\nand you have color stops, or houses as I\nlike to call them, So I was like wait,\n\n190\n00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.220\nis it picking the house or is it actually\nfinding whatever color it is in that\n\n191\n00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.390\ngradient and picking that specific value?\n\n192\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.750\nAnd you just answered my question.\n\n193\n00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.845\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome, you're welcome.\n\n194\n00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:27.230\n[LAUGH] Actually, it is a distinction\nagain that will make sense if you know\n\n195\n00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.700\nwhat gradients are when we do that and\nget into it.\n\n196\n00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.396\nBut it makes a big difference to be able\nto just copy the exact color kind of where\n\n197\n00:09:34.396 --> 00:09:35.240\nthey blend, so.\n\n198\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.780\n&gt;&gt; And if you hadn't been holding Shift,\nit would have copied the whole gradient.\n\n199\n00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.709\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nI'm not holding Shift right now,\n\n200\n00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:44.457\nyou can see I've got my other hand opened.\n\n201\n00:09:44.457 --> 00:09:46.080\nIt will copy that entire gradient.\n\n202\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.810\nSo yes, clear information there.\n\n203\n00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:53.500\nSo one other little trick that you can do\nwith this, and this one's new to me so\n\n204\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.580\nif I screw it up, I apologize and\nwe will start again.\n\n205\n00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.340\nBut something else that you can copy is\nsomething from your desktop formatting.\n\n206\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.470\nSo let's say I have this, and\n\n207\n00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.668\nI've got this color, I don't know how\nmuch you can see of my desktop here.\n\n208\n00:10:07.668 --> 00:10:10.219\nAnd I'll even make this black so\nit's more apparent.\n\n209\n00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:14.260\nI have this kinda buttery\nyellow desktop if you will.\n\n210\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.950\nWhat I can do, I can take my eye dropper\ntool, and then what you should be able to\n\n211\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.980\nto, I should be able to click just\nanywhere on my art board here.\n\n212\n00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.980\nI'm just kind of clicking in a blank area.\n\n213\n00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.510\nObviously you don't want to\nclick on another object cuz it\n\n214\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.690\nwill copy that formatting.\n\n215\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:34.002\nBut if I just click in a blank area and\nthen drag down to my desktop and let go.\n\n216\n00:10:34.002 --> 00:10:34.633\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n217\n00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:36.900\n&gt;&gt; It selects the color from my desktop.\n\n218\n00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.310\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, I had to say something.\n\n219\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.388\nCuz I was like, be quiet,\nmy gosh, that's amazing.\n\n220\n00:10:41.388 --> 00:10:43.591\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know it is.\n\n221\n00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:48.431\nAnd the interesting thing too is you'll\nsee that Illustrator has kind of a shadow\n\n222\n00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:49.810\nunderneath it.\n\n223\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.720\nIt caught the shadow.\n\n224\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.400\nThat's not, so\n\n225\n00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.830\nit's giving you kind of like a-\n&gt;&gt; It's like pixel level detail.\n\n226\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.706\nSo if you had an icon on your\ndesktop that was blue and white, and\n\n227\n00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:03.144\nyou hovered over the blue,\nit might get the exact blue or\n\n228\n00:11:03.144 --> 00:11:06.460\nwhatever anti-aliasing\nthe color that was around.\n\n229\n00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.820\nWow, okay.\n\n230\n00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.960\nI wonder how long that's been there?\n\n231\n00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.540\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know.\n\n232\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.760\nIt was a fairly new thing that I learned,\nand I mean I can see why.\n\n233\n00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.690\nIt's not something that you\nwould probably use all the time,\n\n234\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.610\nbecause more than likely if you have an\nimage, we could do this with images, too.\n\n235\n00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.060\nIf I had an image that I wanted to use,\nI could place that into my Illustrator\n\n236\n00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.930\nwork space and\nthen pull the color out of the image.\n\n237\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.220\nBut occasionally you have an icon,\nthat's a great example.\n\n238\n00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nnot to go too far in the weeds.\n\n239\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:41.180\nBut what if they, you don't know if\nit's grabbing the CMYK value or the RG.\n\n240\n00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.990\nLike to me, I'm starting thinking like,\n\n241\n00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.960\nis it gonna translate that from\nRGB into CMYK if I'm using print?\n\n242\n00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.080\nAgain, I'm going too deep\ninto my designer brain\n\n243\n00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.042\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n244\n00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:51.795\n&gt;&gt; But I'd be curious to know about that.\n\n245\n00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:55.638\nBut then you could just go ahead and\nmodify it within the color panel to get it\n\n246\n00:11:55.638 --> 00:11:58.640\nto whatever specific value and\ncolor space you need to go.\n\n247\n00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.770\nAgain, going a little too far,\nbut I'm very impressed.\n\n248\n00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.460\nMy brain's doing this right now.\n\n249\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.470\n[SOUND] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, so many different options, yeah.\n\n250\n00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.970\nIt's pretty cool, the things you\ncan do with the eye dropper tool.\n\n251\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.650\nAnd it's one of those,\nI feel like I say this a lot, but\n\n252\n00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.520\nit's one of those in Illustrator\nwhere you kinda look at it and\n\n253\n00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.130\nyou're like, whatever,\nthat's not that exciting.\n\n254\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.848\nBut when you actually get into it and\nwhen you need it, it's really exciting.\n\n255\n00:12:21.848 --> 00:12:22.455\n[LAUGH] So\n\n256\n00:12:22.455 --> 00:12:27.580\nI kinda wanna move on from there to\ntalking about our transform panel.\n\n257\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.850\nSo what I'm gonna do here, I'm gonna go\nahead and add a stroke to this, just so\n\n258\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.330\nwe can kinda see it.\n\n259\n00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:38.176\nAnd while we get here, if I go ahead and\nthen do this and I grab,\n\n260\n00:12:38.176 --> 00:12:40.241\nopen my transform panel.\n\n261\n00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:41.551\nJust gonna be all the way at the bottom,\n\n262\n00:12:41.551 --> 00:12:43.800\nthese are alphabetized in case\nyou haven't figured that out yet.\n\n263\n00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.480\nGo to your Window menu and then go\nto Transform, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n264\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.430\nkind of grab that here.\n\n265\n00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.140\nSo I'm gonna close the swatches just so\nyou can see it a little bit better.\n\n266\n00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.310\nNow with our Transform panel,\n\n267\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.310\na lot of these things we can do just\nby transforming the bounding box.\n\n268\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.732\nSo we remember, we can go here,\nwe can change the size with our arrows,\n\n269\n00:13:01.732 --> 00:13:05.073\nI could rotate with my arrows or\nsomething like that.\n\n270\n00:13:05.073 --> 00:13:08.292\nBut I did want to point out that you do\nalso have these options available to you\n\n271\n00:13:08.292 --> 00:13:11.780\nin the Transform panel along with some\nother things that you can kind of look at.\n\n272\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.240\nSo one of the things that we\ncan look at is the width and\n\n273\n00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.730\nheight, you can see that there.\n\n274\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.540\nIf for some reason you wanted\nto change the width and\n\n275\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.180\nheight, you would just kinda\ndraw it out haphazardly, or\n\n276\n00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.640\nnot haphazardly, but\nyou just kinda drawed it out.\n\n277\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.820\nAnd then later decided, okay,\n\n278\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.980\nyou know what, I really need this\nto be exactly four inches wide.\n\n279\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.100\nYou could go ahead and type in four and\nit would go ahead and do that for you.\n\n280\n00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.440\nSo that is an option.\n\n281\n00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.680\nAnother option that you have, and Vonne\nand I were kind of talking about this\n\n282\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.210\nearlier, is you see these little\nsort of grid here of dots?\n\n283\n00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.170\nThis is actually known\nas your reference point.\n\n284\n00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.900\nSo everything in Illustrator\ntypically kind of\n\n285\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.400\nmoves from the top left hand corner.\n\n286\n00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.090\nAnd so what we can do here is we\ncan change our reference point.\n\n287\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.800\nNow we were kind of joking here.\n\n288\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.850\nWe've used this before and\nit's something that we use,\n\n289\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.820\nbut there's not really a ton of\nreasons why you would need to.\n\n290\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.800\nSometimes it kinda looks\nthe same no matter what.\n\n291\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then this is one of those\nwhen I was first starting out, I never\n\n292\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.410\neven looked at the reference point and\neven the Transform panel at all.\n\n293\n00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.100\nCuz it was just more of I'm just drawing,\nI'm just getting used to this.\n\n294\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:23.161\nBut the deeper you get into [LAUGH]\nquote unquote serious designing or\n\n295\n00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:25.826\nwhatever you wanna say [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:14:25.826 --> 00:14:28.425\n&gt;&gt; Then exact measurements really start\n\n297\n00:14:28.425 --> 00:14:30.030\nto make a difference.\n\n298\n00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.900\nAnd you need to know all,\n\n299\n00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.130\nI have to make sure that this\noccupies this particular space.\n\n300\n00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.830\nBut I didn't really start\nimplementing this panel\n\n301\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.640\nat all till later in my career,\nif you wanna say.\n\n302\n00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.645\nAnd then the reference point of where\nI'm sizing or even flipping sometimes.\n\n303\n00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:49.400\nDo I use it every single day?\n\n304\n00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.602\nNo, but I've had to kind of\ngrow accustomed to it and\n\n305\n00:14:53.602 --> 00:14:58.195\nappreciate its value for\nme later down the road.\n\n306\n00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:01.062\nSo that's just my kind of two\ncents on the reference panel.\n\n307\n00:15:01.062 --> 00:15:02.495\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah and\n\n308\n00:15:02.495 --> 00:15:03.325\nI think that's a good point.\n\n309\n00:15:03.325 --> 00:15:07.365\nIt's probably not something that you would\nneed right now, but if the situation ever\n\n310\n00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:09.915\ncame up later where you're like,\nI'm kinda in this weird moment.\n\n311\n00:15:09.915 --> 00:15:12.335\nYou can probably think, okay,\ngo back to your Transform panel and\n\n312\n00:15:12.335 --> 00:15:14.195\nyou can change that reference point.\n\n313\n00:15:14.195 --> 00:15:15.835\nNow something else that\nyou have available to use,\n\n314\n00:15:15.835 --> 00:15:17.055\nsome of these are kinda duplicated,\n\n315\n00:15:17.055 --> 00:15:20.840\nyou'll see the rectangle properties,\nyou can see the size there.\n\n316\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.380\nYou also see the rectangle angle, that's\nbasically just gonna be your rotation.\n\n317\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.020\nThe same option is available to you right\nhere where we see the zero degrees.\n\n318\n00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.550\nI can kind of change that to 120\nwhich flips it all the way around.\n\n319\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:39.280\nYou also have this shear option\nwhich would kind of take that and\n\n320\n00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.960\nthen shear it for lack of a better word,\nI don't know how else to describe that.\n\n321\n00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.788\nIt would kind of just shift it that way.\n\n322\n00:15:45.788 --> 00:15:48.728\nSo a couple other things I\nwanted to point out to you.\n\n323\n00:15:48.728 --> 00:15:52.568\nAll of those I think that you can find,\naside from the reference point,\n\n324\n00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:54.751\nyou can find that in different options.\n\n325\n00:15:54.751 --> 00:15:59.169\nYou can see that we have kind of a Skew,\ntool, and other ways of doing it.\n\n326\n00:15:59.169 --> 00:16:03.725\nYou could use your white arrow for that,\nyou can certainly rotate in other ways,\n\n327\n00:16:03.725 --> 00:16:07.879\nbut what's kind of special to the\ntransform tool are gonna be these corner\n\n328\n00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:10.810\noptions, and\nI have all the information below it.\n\n329\n00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.750\nWhat we have here is we\nhave our corner type.\n\n330\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.988\nSo basically what we're looking at in\na traditional shape, particularly from\n\n331\n00:16:17.988 --> 00:16:22.650\nlooking at something like a square or\na rectangle, everything comes to a point.\n\n332\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:28.240\nIt all has that kinda harsh corner,\nnot harsh, but that 90 degree angle.\n\n333\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.934\nIf I wanted to soften that for whatever\nreason what I could do is I could go into\n\n334\n00:16:31.934 --> 00:16:33.981\nthese corner options, or corner types.\n\n335\n00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:37.100\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nincrease this corner radius.\n\n336\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.950\nNow I can see that all of\nthese are linked here.\n\n337\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.262\nSo everything that I do to one,\nis gonna happen to all four corners.\n\n338\n00:16:44.262 --> 00:16:46.395\nIf you wanted to you could go ahead and\nunlink that,\n\n339\n00:16:46.395 --> 00:16:47.790\nit just depends on what you want.\n\n340\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.667\nSo if you wanna be able to adjust to\neach individually then you do have that\n\n341\n00:16:50.667 --> 00:16:51.290\noption there.\n\n342\n00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.001\nSo, what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna increase this radius, and\n\n343\n00:16:55.001 --> 00:16:59.920\nwhat you may be seeing is okay I'm getting\nsome rounded kind of edges to my corners.\n\n344\n00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.610\nNow you're not just stuck with round.\n\n345\n00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.904\nIf I click on this drop down menu\nwhere you now see my rounded corners,\n\n346\n00:17:05.904 --> 00:17:09.620\nI can change that to kind of a beveled or\nwhatever I wanna do.\n\n347\n00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.018\nSo that is also an option that you have\navailable to you, and the funny thing is,\n\n348\n00:17:13.018 --> 00:17:15.790\nin that case, you will see that\nit only changed that one corner.\n\n349\n00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:20.021\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say, I'm like, wait,\nI thought we were doing all four corners\n\n350\n00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:24.520\ntogether because we have the lock on, but\nthe type, it looks very corner specific.\n\n351\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.211\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n352\n00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.340\n&gt;&gt; Hm, interesting.\n\n353\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:26.981\n&gt;&gt; Which is interesting, right?\n\n354\n00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:27.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You wouldn't really\n\n355\n00:17:27.985 --> 00:17:28.741\nexpect it to be like that.\n\n356\n00:17:28.741 --> 00:17:31.220\nThe size goes for all four.\n\n357\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.242\nThe corner type is\nspecific to each corner.\n\n358\n00:17:34.242 --> 00:17:36.832\nAlthough you'll notice\nthat when I first did it,\n\n359\n00:17:36.832 --> 00:17:39.053\nall four corners switched to the rounded,\n\n360\n00:17:39.053 --> 00:17:43.141\nand then it went and I change it after\nthat, then it was specific to the corner.\n\n361\n00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:46.476\nSo a little bit of a funky thing\nthat you may just kinda wanna pay\n\n362\n00:17:46.476 --> 00:17:47.752\nattention to-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:17:47.752 --> 00:17:49.367\n&gt;&gt; If you are gonna be flipping it\n\n364\n00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:50.155\naround a lot.\n\n365\n00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:53.830\nNow, I'm just gonna stick\nwith what I've got here, and\n\n366\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.960\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nincrease my stroke width a little bit,\n\n367\n00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.400\njust to illustrate the next\nthing I'm gonna point out.\n\n368\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.469\nSo we have this scale corners option.\n\n369\n00:18:01.469 --> 00:18:04.954\nScale corners is basically just\ngonna scale kind of the roundness\n\n370\n00:18:04.954 --> 00:18:09.198\nof those corners, and that's something\nI think that's turned on by default in\n\n371\n00:18:09.198 --> 00:18:13.124\nIllustrator, but something that is not,\n[LAUGH] and I think is actually,\n\n372\n00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:16.700\nequally if not more important,\nis the scale strokes and effects.\n\n373\n00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.256\nSo let's say that I have this shape,\nand it's this large, and then,\n\n374\n00:18:21.256 --> 00:18:25.212\nlater as I'm working,\nI wanna go ahead and make it smaller.\n\n375\n00:18:25.212 --> 00:18:29.097\nIf I go ahead and do this, and\nI have a 12 point stroke on it,\n\n376\n00:18:29.097 --> 00:18:34.281\nyou see that stroke looks very different\nat a small size then it does at this size,\n\n377\n00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:38.351\nand so it's really gonna impact\nthe appearance of your shape.\n\n378\n00:18:38.351 --> 00:18:42.515\nSo what we can do, is we can turn on\nthis scale, strokes, and effects, and\n\n379\n00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:46.370\nwhat it will do is it will naturally\nadjust the scale of your strokes.\n\n380\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.035\nSo you'll see in this case, it took it\ndown to a 2.481, something like that.\n\n381\n00:18:50.035 --> 00:18:53.995\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it keeps the proportions\nconstrained, if you wanna say,\n\n382\n00:18:53.995 --> 00:18:58.459\nwith the what it looks like here when\nyou applied it, you make it smaller or\n\n383\n00:18:58.459 --> 00:19:01.560\nbigger, we're gonna go ahead and\nchange as well.\n\n384\n00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.960\nThis is a huge one for me,\nwhether you want it on or\n\n385\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.230\noff, I have reasons why\nit needs to be on and\n\n386\n00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.610\nit needs to be off,\nbecause it's like 2.1.4, you know?\n\n387\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:19.510\nThat gets a little strange sometimes,\nbut I want the visual consistency,\n\n388\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.852\nor the visual proportions to stay,\nkeep it on, and\n\n389\n00:19:22.852 --> 00:19:26.375\nit is one of those things,\nthat it's kind of hidden.\n\n390\n00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:27.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n391\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.565\n&gt;&gt; It's in this menu, it's also in\nthe preferences and stuff like that.\n\n392\n00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:31.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it is nice to\n\n393\n00:19:31.552 --> 00:19:35.590\nkeep it on the transform panel here\non the bottom to know where it's at.\n\n394\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:40.310\nBut the more you'll use this, you'll\nrealize how important it is to know where\n\n395\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:44.199\nthat checkbox is, and when to turn it on,\nand when to turn it off.\n\n396\n00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:45.166\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, and exactly,\n\n397\n00:19:45.166 --> 00:19:46.093\nI think you mentioned a great point.\n\n398\n00:19:46.093 --> 00:19:48.691\nThere are times when you'll wanna\nuse it and time when you don't.\n\n399\n00:19:48.691 --> 00:19:52.262\nSo it's nice to have an idea of, or\nhave that option to go ahead and flip it,\n\n400\n00:19:52.262 --> 00:19:56.236\nillustrator doesn't just pick one for\nyou, and you'll notice this has a scales,\n\n401\n00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:57.470\nstrokes, and effects.\n\n402\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.374\nSo we haven't necessarily\ntalked about effects yet,\n\n403\n00:20:00.374 --> 00:20:02.456\nif you're watching this in order, but\n\n404\n00:20:02.456 --> 00:20:06.617\njust to know that if I had something like\na drop shadow applied to this, the same\n\n405\n00:20:06.617 --> 00:20:11.062\nconcept would apply to any sort of effect,\nit would also kind of scale that as well.\n\n406\n00:20:11.062 --> 00:20:13.150\nNow there's one thing that I\nwanted to point out with this.\n\n407\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.353\nSo we're seeing kind of\na rounded corners here.\n\n408\n00:20:15.353 --> 00:20:18.560\nIllustrator has another kind\nof rounded corner option.\n\n409\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.898\nSo, it's kind of confusing, but\n\n410\n00:20:20.898 --> 00:20:26.151\nbasically the rounded corners there is\nreally just impacting your corners.\n\n411\n00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:31.097\nIf you want something that impacts\nreally your shape more, all together,\n\n412\n00:20:31.097 --> 00:20:35.190\nwhat you wanna do to round your\ncorners is choose this method.\n\n413\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.710\nSo, what you'll notice,\nif I draw a square, and\n\n414\n00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:43.265\nthen go back to my black arrow tool,\nwell we can move that up.\n\n415\n00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:44.982\nWe'll just jut it over here.\n\n416\n00:20:44.982 --> 00:20:48.730\nSo what we're looking at, okay,\nwe have a perfectly shaped rectangle.\n\n417\n00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.170\nWe have those hard edges.\n\n418\n00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.070\nYou do have a rounded rectangle tool\nin Illustrator, but I feel like they're\n\n419\n00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.610\nalmost phasing that out,\nbecause now they've added in this option,\n\n420\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.013\nwhich has to do with these\nlittle circles here.\n\n421\n00:21:00.013 --> 00:21:03.360\nSo these little circles in the top, or\nI shouldn't say the top, but all four\n\n422\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.836\ncorners of your shape, and even it shows\nup if you've been using the pen tool.\n\n423\n00:21:06.836 --> 00:21:08.435\nIt'll show up in other shapes.\n\n424\n00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:11.932\nIt's not specific just to a square, or\na rectangle, or something like that.\n\n425\n00:21:11.932 --> 00:21:15.450\nBut what you can do is you can\nselect these little circles.\n\n426\n00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.063\nDon't try and\n\n427\n00:21:16.063 --> 00:21:19.950\nselect the point like you typically would\nwhere you get their double pointed arrows.\n\n428\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:25.290\nBut if you select those circles\nspecifically and then drag in you're gonna\n\n429\n00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:30.350\nget, not quite the same type of rounded\ncorner that you saw with the corner\n\n430\n00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.360\noptions with our transform panel, but\nit's something that's gonna impact and\n\n431\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.100\nreally change the entire dimension\nof your shape a lot differently,\n\n432\n00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:42.130\nI would say, and the other option that we\nhave with this, is just to adjust one.\n\n433\n00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.737\nNow this one, in order to just change one\ncorner, I feel like it's kind of tricky.\n\n434\n00:21:46.737 --> 00:21:50.240\nVonne and\nI were actually discussing this here.\n\n435\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.433\nWhat you have to do, you have to\nsingle-click to select something, and\n\n436\n00:21:54.433 --> 00:21:59.522\nthen kinda single-click on it again, it's\nnot really necessarily a double-click,\n\n437\n00:21:59.522 --> 00:22:02.342\nalthough I think even\nthat sometimes will work,\n\n438\n00:22:02.342 --> 00:22:05.192\nif you just double-click\non a specific corner.\n\n439\n00:22:05.192 --> 00:22:08.743\nBut say for whatever reason you\nonly wanted to round one corner,\n\n440\n00:22:08.743 --> 00:22:13.149\nwhat I could do, kind of single-click\nto select it, single-click again, or\n\n441\n00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:16.870\neven if you wanna go crazy and\ndouble-click, I do think it works.\n\n442\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.968\nBut sometimes I think there's a little\nbit of distinction between kinda\n\n443\n00:22:19.968 --> 00:22:23.371\nsingle-clicking and then single-clicking\nagain, if that makes sense, and\n\n444\n00:22:23.371 --> 00:22:26.060\nthat's an option as well to just\ngo ahead and round one corner,\n\n445\n00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.913\nwhich sometimes I think looks kinda cool.\n\n446\n00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:29.459\nIf you want that kind of effect.\n\n447\n00:22:29.459 --> 00:22:33.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I like how you really\nkind of drove it home, I wanna say,\n\n448\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:38.980\nwith the thing in the transform panel of\nrounding the corners, it's still a square.\n\n449\n00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.772\nIt's still straight points, when we\nget into what type of points you have.\n\n450\n00:22:42.772 --> 00:22:46.391\nThis is like you're actually\nmodifying the path itself.\n\n451\n00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:50.026\nSo people are like, well,\nit's the same thing.\n\n452\n00:22:50.026 --> 00:22:52.901\n[SOUND] It's the same,\nbut different [LAUGH].\n\n453\n00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:53.423\nMy favorite saying.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n454\n00:22:53.423 --> 00:22:57.358\n&gt;&gt; So just kind of keep that in mind when\nyou're, especially when you get into like\n\n455\n00:22:57.358 --> 00:23:00.840\nwhat the white arrow will do to select\npoints and how you can modify it.\n\n456\n00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.740\nThat will make a big difference here.\n\n457\n00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.287\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and actually I think you lead us\nnicely with that white arrow thing into\n\n458\n00:23:06.287 --> 00:23:09.945\nour next point, which is talking about\nsome of the transform tools that you have\n\n459\n00:23:09.945 --> 00:23:11.280\navailable to you.\n\n460\n00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.075\n&gt;&gt; Again, this is another thing that we\nwere kinda discussing before the episode.\n\n461\n00:23:15.075 --> 00:23:17.776\nThese are just things that I\ndon't personally use a lot,\n\n462\n00:23:17.776 --> 00:23:21.039\nbecause I would typically, personally,\nuse the wide arrow tool for\n\n463\n00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:23.363\nsome of these things\nthat we're gonna discuss.\n\n464\n00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:27.271\nSo you do have options for\na free transform tool.\n\n465\n00:23:27.271 --> 00:23:32.050\nYou also have a scale tool, and if I click\nand hold that you also have a shear tool.\n\n466\n00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.282\nShear was kind of that thing we did in our\ntransform panel where it sheared it there.\n\n467\n00:23:36.282 --> 00:23:38.934\nBut if I go ahead and\ngrab my free transform tool,\n\n468\n00:23:38.934 --> 00:23:41.860\njust to give you guys kind of\nan idea of how this works.\n\n469\n00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.490\nNow, like I said this just really isn't\nsomething I use all that often, but\n\n470\n00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.171\nI have a general idea that I\ncan kind of discuss with you.\n\n471\n00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:50.380\nYou have these kind of\noptions that appear.\n\n472\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.008\nIt's almost like that\ntoolbar tearoff that comes\n\n473\n00:23:53.008 --> 00:23:55.143\nup in the top left-hand corner for you.\n\n474\n00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:57.113\nOne, this first option\nis gonna be constrained.\n\n475\n00:23:57.113 --> 00:24:01.842\nThat's gonna kinda be the proportions that\nwe mentioned very similar to the links\n\n476\n00:24:01.842 --> 00:24:03.564\nthat you will see otherwise.\n\n477\n00:24:03.564 --> 00:24:06.944\nWe also have this free transform option.\n\n478\n00:24:06.944 --> 00:24:09.257\nWe have perspective distort and\nfree distort, and\n\n479\n00:24:09.257 --> 00:24:12.180\nthis is almost one that you just\nkinda have to play around with.\n\n480\n00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.950\nSo, I'm gonna go around and\ngrab this new c.\n\n481\n00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.175\nI can kinda grab each\none of the corners and\n\n482\n00:24:16.175 --> 00:24:20.130\nthis is pretty similar to what we're\nlooking at here if I grab the corner.\n\n483\n00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:24.080\nBut then if I can kinda go over here,\nI have the option to like drag it in,\n\n484\n00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.270\nand I think you can, yeah,\nyou can kinda shear it like that.\n\n485\n00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.560\nSo you have the option to\nkind of just freely distort.\n\n486\n00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.660\nThe key with this always trying to click\nthe on those little white circles and\n\n487\n00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.620\nthat's really gonna be kinda\nyour distortion point.\n\n488\n00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.536\nSo, if you will, so you can go ahead and\n\n489\n00:24:39.536 --> 00:24:41.990\nkinda try it out with each\nof the different tools.\n\n490\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:47.080\nYou see the perspective distort kind of,\nagain, kind of add to that shear.\n\n491\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.270\nYou can see how the, I think this\none's the free distort option,\n\n492\n00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.690\nyou know how that one is gonna work.\n\n493\n00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.980\nI can kinda drag these two in,\nwhich can be really nice tools.\n\n494\n00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.328\nI do think you'll find once you\nget into the white arrow tool and\n\n495\n00:25:00.328 --> 00:25:04.071\nsome of those other options,\nthat's probably gonna be your go-to.\n\n496\n00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:05.700\nBut you do have the availability here.\n\n497\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.260\n&gt;&gt; And right now,\nwe're just changing a square,\n\n498\n00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:13.100\nit's almost like you don't\nsee the laying down part.\n\n499\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.520\nWhen you're distorting or\nchanging the perspective,\n\n500\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.320\nit's like you're kind of shifting it.\n\n501\n00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.310\nSo if you think of,\nif this was like a photograph.\n\n502\n00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:24.360\nOr something that had text on it,\n\n503\n00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.400\nthat's where you can really see the\nperspective change, and things like that.\n\n504\n00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.670\nSo if you had, say,\n\n505\n00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.680\nsome text that you wanted to kind of look\nlike it was on the side of a building or\n\n506\n00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.010\nsomething, you might wanna go ahead and\nuse some of these tools.\n\n507\n00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.510\nYou might have to convert\nit to outlines first.\n\n508\n00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n509\n00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:40.764\n&gt;&gt; Getting a little ahead.\n\n510\n00:25:40.764 --> 00:25:42.330\n&gt;&gt; Perspective grid tool, yeah.\n\n511\n00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.140\n[CROSSTALK] All of that.\n\n512\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.157\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It may kind of all blend together\n\n513\n00:25:46.157 --> 00:25:50.509\na little bit, so you're like,\nI don't see the whole perspective\n\n514\n00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:55.210\ndistort going on in this particular\nexample, but the tools are there.\n\n515\n00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:59.890\nLike you said,\nI don't use these all that frequently, but\n\n516\n00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.810\nit is one of those to each its own.\n\n517\n00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.810\nI want to let you know where it's at,\n\n518\n00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:08.809\nso you can be able to modify it cuz\nthere's always 15 ways [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:26:08.809 --> 00:26:09.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Every time.\n\n520\n00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:10.540\n&gt;&gt; To do things.\n\n521\n00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n522\n00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.230\nI think it is nice to know if you're just\ngetting comfortable with illustrator and\n\n523\n00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.530\nyou're getting comfortable\nwith binary tool.\n\n524\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.790\nAnd kinda start discussing that,\nthat might be kind of a good introduction\n\n525\n00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.290\nis just to use those free\ntransform tools for what you do.\n\n526\n00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:28.190\nNow, I think that's it,\nas far as our object transformations,\n\n527\n00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.080\nhowever you wanna call it.\n\n528\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.710\nTalking about our eyedropper tools,\ntransform panel, and\n\n529\n00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.280\nsome of the transform tools.\n\n530\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.260\nDon't forget that scales,\nstrokes, and effects in there too,\n\n531\n00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.510\nthat was a really important one.\n\n532\n00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.780\nSo, I think that's it for today.\n\n533\n00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.240\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So you can wrap it up and.\n\n534\n00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful, all right, yeah, good\nintroduction to object transformation,\n\n535\n00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.136\nwhatever we decided to name this [LAUGH].\n\n536\n00:26:48.136 --> 00:26:50.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm mixing all of these different\n\n537\n00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:52.235\ntools that you can do to your objects.\n\n538\n00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:53.605\nSo I think we're good.\n\n539\n00:26:53.605 --> 00:26:55.865\nI'm gonna stop, because I'm gonna\nstart just talking in circles.\n\n540\n00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:56.455\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n541\n00:26:56.455 --> 00:26:57.995\nLet's go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n542\n00:26:57.995 --> 00:27:00.895\nSigning off for CREATIVEPRO.TV,\nI'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n543\n00:27:00.895 --> 00:27:01.595\n&gt;&gt;

to\nanother exciting edition of CreativeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.790\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and we're\ncontinuing on with Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n5\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.169\nWe're at the stage where we're going\nto do images, yehey, pictures.\n\n6\n00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.814\n[LAUGH] So\nhere to help us along is Ms Emily Ramsey.\n\n7\n00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:28.350\nHow are we doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.762\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, thank you.\n\n9\n00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:33.103\nAnd yeah, images, so kind of\nan interesting thing in Illustrator.\n\n10\n00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:35.824\nI think it's nice to\nkind of distinguish here,\n\n11\n00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:39.443\nwe're not actually talking about\ncreating images right now.\n\n12\n00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:43.640\nWhat we're talking about is working with\nimages inside your Illustrator documents.\n\n13\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.870\nSo kind of just a little bit of\na distinction for you there.\n\n14\n00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.213\nSo what we're gonna be talking about is,\nof course,\n\n15\n00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:50.513\nhow to get an image into\nyour Illustrator document.\n\n16\n00:00:50.513 --> 00:00:55.125\nAnd then, also kind of a couple of little\nthings that you should know when you\n\n17\n00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.665\nare using an image in Illustrator.\n\n18\n00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:00.385\nAnd some little tips and\ntricks that go along with that.\n\n19\n00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:03.960\nSo, what I would recommend to you now,\ngo ahead and find an image.\n\n20\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.881\nIf you wanna pause me, go ahead and\nGoogle search something.\n\n21\n00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:11.870\nWhatever you think you looks cool and\nfind an image that you wanna work with.\n\n22\n00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.806\nYou got a picture of your kids,\nyour cats, whatever.\n\n23\n00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:17.348\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kids, cats.\n\n24\n00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:19.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's the list.\n\n25\n00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.961\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where my list runs out.\n\n26\n00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:26.970\nI think other people probably you could\nthrow a dog in there I guess whatever.\n\n27\n00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.960\nWhatever kind of picture you have,\njust go ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.732\nfind it,\ndoesn't matter what it looks like.\n\n29\n00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:32.570\nWe're gonna be working with\na picture of my cat today,\n\n30\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.730\nso I'm sorry if you are not a cat lover,\nthat's what you are gonna be looking at.\n\n31\n00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.170\nSo one thing that I wanna go ahead and\nget started with and we can go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.460\nlook at my Illustrator workspace\nhere Images in Illustrator\n\n33\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.490\nare inserted [LAUGH] through\na process called placing.\n\n34\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.692\nAnd I almost hesitated to say the word\ninsert there because if you're accustomed\n\n35\n00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:53.753\nto other programs.\n\n36\n00:01:53.753 --> 00:01:56.387\nAgain, like\na Microsoft Office-based program,\n\n37\n00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:00.614\nyou're probably gonna be looking for like\na edit, insert or insert something and\n\n38\n00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:03.560\nthat's what you're gonna\nbe kinda thinking.\n\n39\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.229\nIn Illustrator,\nyou have to look for place.\n\n40\n00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.799\nSo what we're gonna be doing,\nwe're gonna go to file and then place, and\n\n41\n00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.940\nthat's where we're gonna find our image.\n\n42\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.730\nNow, you could also use\nthe keyword shortcut.\n\n43\n00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.570\nIt's a little bit of a long one here but\nit's command, shift+P,\n\n44\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.290\nas in place,\nis the option that you have to use.\n\n45\n00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.990\nI thin if you just use Cmd+ P,\nwhich is always what I wanna do,\n\n46\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.580\nthat's just for printing.\n\n47\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.200\nSo command,\nshift+P is gonna be your option.\n\n48\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.520\nBut we can just go to File &gt; Place, and\nit's just gonna be right down there.\n\n49\n00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.560\nNow, what this is gonna do is it's\njust gonna pull up your computer,\n\n50\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.600\nyour files that you would\ntypically think it would.\n\n51\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.440\nSo we can go to File &gt; Place.\n\n52\n00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.883\nWe can just ignore all the cool\nstuff I have on my desktop here.\n\n53\n00:02:44.883 --> 00:02:48.025\nAnd what you're gonna see, I've got\nthis awesome picture of my cat, so\n\n54\n00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:49.530\nI'm gonna go ahead and grab that.\n\n55\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.075\nAnd I'm just gonna choose Place now,\nso I'm gonna do that.\n\n56\n00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:55.520\nNow there are two different\nthings that I can do here.\n\n57\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.110\nOne, either way, you'll see that it's\nnot really inserted into my file yet.\n\n58\n00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.580\nWhat you're gonna see here is that\nthis is just kind of picked up.\n\n59\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.630\nIt's almost like picked up on my cursor.\n\n60\n00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.570\nAnd I believe if I actually changed my\nmind and I didn't wanna pick this up,\n\n61\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.910\nI could just hit the Escape key on\nmy keyboard and say, you know what?\n\n62\n00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.470\nI don't really like my\ncat that much anyway,\n\n63\n00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.230\nI don't wanna use a picture of him.\n\n64\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.194\nBut otherwise, if I do wanna put that in\nthere, I'm gonna go File &gt; Place again,\n\n65\n00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:21.182\ngrab that picture.\n\n66\n00:03:21.182 --> 00:03:24.680\nI have two different ways that I can\ndo this to actually place it down.\n\n67\n00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.580\nAnd this is where the placing thing\ncomes in rather than just inserting.\n\n68\n00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.525\nSo what you're gonna do, you're gonna find\nan idea of where you want this to go.\n\n69\n00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:34.371\nKind of like most things in illustrator,\n\n70\n00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:38.120\nyour top left-hand corner is always\ngonna be kind of that reference point.\n\n71\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.190\nSo it's always gonna drop from\nthe top-left hand corner of the image.\n\n72\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.720\nNow, in my case, I know for a fact what\nI'm looking at is a really big picture.\n\n73\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.550\nSo if I go ahead and just drop this down,\nif I just single click and\n\n74\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.505\nplace this down, it's like, I see\nreally up view of that cat hair, right?\n\n75\n00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:58.279\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so what you'd have to do,\n\n76\n00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.411\ngo zoom out.\n\n77\n00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:02.333\nAnd then similar to editing a shape,\nyou would go ahead and\n\n78\n00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.013\nuse your double pointed arrows.\n\n79\n00:04:04.013 --> 00:04:08.704\nAlways making sure to hold down to shift,\nso that we can resize this proportionally\n\n80\n00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:13.080\nwithin image specially you wanna be\ncareful not to distort something.\n\n81\n00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.466\nSo I'm gonna hold down that shift key, and\n\n82\n00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:18.060\nI'm gonna resize that to\nthe size that I want.\n\n83\n00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.780\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n84\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.150\nhit Cmd or Ctrl+0 there to kind\nof zoom back in to my workspace.\n\n85\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.273\nNow, that works fine.\n\n86\n00:04:24.273 --> 00:04:27.465\nIf you wanna save yourself some time,\nespecially, again, if you\n\n87\n00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:31.341\nknow you have a larger image, what you can\ndo you can go back to your File &gt; Place or\n\n88\n00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:35.560\ncommand shift+P, find your image, Place.\n\n89\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.195\nAnd then what I'm gonna do, rather than\njust doing the single-click drop down,\n\n90\n00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:41.249\nI'm actually gonna click, hold, and drag,\n\n91\n00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.900\nand actually create the size\nof that imagine that I want.\n\n92\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.540\nSo I'm gonna click, hold, and drag,\nand say, that's about how large\n\n93\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.930\nI want it to be, I don't really wanna\nsee any closer to my cat than that.\n\n94\n00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.480\nAnd I can go ahead and\nuse that as my option for placing.\n\n95\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.140\nSo now,\nmoving on from actually placing it,\n\n96\n00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.011\nthere's something that\nI wanna point out here.\n\n97\n00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:03.834\nAnd that you'll see in\nthe very top-left hand corner,\n\n98\n00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:08.040\nyou can see in the top left of our\ncontrol bar, it says linked file.\n\n99\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.185\nImages in Illustrator are linked,\nnot embedded.\n\n100\n00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:13.785\nSo what is that mean?\n\n101\n00:05:13.785 --> 00:05:16.598\nThat means,\nthat they're kind of connected to, but\n\n102\n00:05:16.598 --> 00:05:20.735\nstill kind of isolated from our original,\nor from our Illustrator document.\n\n103\n00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:24.675\nSo essentially what Illustrator is doing\nis it's always gonna be looking back to\n\n104\n00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:27.835\nwherever it is on your computer,\nwhen you originally placed it.\n\n105\n00:05:27.835 --> 00:05:31.650\nSo in my case, I have this image\njust like randomly on my desktop.\n\n106\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.520\nSo Illustrator is always kind of connected\nto that place on my desktop, thinking,\n\n107\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.930\nokay, where is that?\n\n108\n00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.191\nNow, embedding an image is an option.\n\n109\n00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:44.785\nYou can see I have this embed here right\nthere, but what's gonna happen is, it's\n\n110\n00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:49.379\ngonna copy that entire image into your\ndocument at the images full resolution, so\n\n111\n00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:50.596\nwhat does that mean?\n\n112\n00:05:50.596 --> 00:05:53.700\nThat means your file size\nis gonna get a lot larger.\n\n113\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.120\nSo the nice thing about linking is it\nreally gonna keeps your file size down.\n\n114\n00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.370\nIt's also nice because you can see with\nthat linked image you have an option to\n\n115\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.180\nedit the original.\n\n116\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.750\nSo if I were to choose that it could take\nme into Photoshop or something like that\n\n117\n00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.600\nif I really wanted to make this look nice,\nadjust some of the coloring or whatever.\n\n118\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.020\nI do have that option there.\n\n119\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.950\nNow, one thing I wanted to point out that\nis that this is still raster information.\n\n120\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.420\nSo remember to raster versus vector?\n\n121\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.560\nIllustrator is a vector-based program.\n\n122\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.390\nWe have that kind of\nmath that goes behind it.\n\n123\n00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.280\nEverything is kind of infinitely scaled or\nall that.\n\n124\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.320\nWhen put an image into Illustrator,\nit's not like\n\n125\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.430\nnatively turning it into a vector\ninformation, it's still raster-based.\n\n126\n00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.915\nYou still have that PPI you wanna pay\nattention to, if that's important to you.\n\n127\n00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:46.725\nResolution there, that's still going\nto matter, you can't just kind of\n\n128\n00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:49.835\ninfinitely scale something just\nbecause it's in Illustrator.\n\n129\n00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:53.585\nIt's still an image,\nit's still made out of pixels, so\n\n130\n00:06:53.585 --> 00:06:55.525\nthat's something that you\ndo wanna pay attention to.\n\n131\n00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:59.157\nNow, we're gonna skip past the image\ntrace, the mask that right there,\n\n132\n00:06:59.157 --> 00:07:02.263\ncuz those are things that we're\ngonna talk about separately,\n\n133\n00:07:02.263 --> 00:07:04.563\nthere's several different masking things.\n\n134\n00:07:04.563 --> 00:07:06.051\nImage trace is awesome, but\n\n135\n00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.330\nI really wanna dedicate some\ntime specifically just to that.\n\n136\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.272\nSo, what I do wanna talk about\nthough is this cropping option.\n\n137\n00:07:13.272 --> 00:07:17.101\nI kinda laugh when I say this\nbecause cropping just became\n\n138\n00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:19.670\navailable in Illustrator, really.\n\n139\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.905\nAnd it's one of those\nthings that it's like,\n\n140\n00:07:21.905 --> 00:07:25.650\nwe've all been kind of finding our\nways around it for the longest time.\n\n141\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.970\nAnd then now finally,\nwe can actually do it.\n\n142\n00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.119\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this was the whole like,\nyou'd have to draw a square, and\n\n143\n00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:34.728\nthen do like a clipping mask, and\nall these kind of complicated things that\n\n144\n00:07:34.728 --> 00:07:37.560\nit's like, why can't I just\nsay just remove this image?\n\n145\n00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.470\nAnd that's when you're like,\nthere's cropping of an image, and\n\n146\n00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.100\nI'm like, my gosh.\n\n147\n00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.240\nHow long has it been,\nlike that we've had to go through\n\n148\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.010\nall these different techniques and\nit's just now a button.\n\n149\n00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.882\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Adobe, thank you.\n\n150\n00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:50.414\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, exactly, and\n\n151\n00:07:50.414 --> 00:07:54.818\nall of you that are just starting out,\nyou're like these ladies are crazy.\n\n152\n00:07:54.818 --> 00:07:56.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What are they talking about?\n\n153\n00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.326\nYes, kind of we had it so\ntough back in the day.\n\n154\n00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:02.946\nBut what we can do now, you see you\nhave this option to crop image.\n\n155\n00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:04.800\nSo if I go ahead and select that,\n\n156\n00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.544\nwhat you're gonna see first is cropping a\nlink file embeds a copy of the original so\n\n157\n00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:12.730\nthey're not cropping that\noriginal file that we had.\n\n158\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.750\nSo it's not gonna mess with\nthe option on my desktop.\n\n159\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.360\nNow you do want to pay attention too,\nbecause it's embedding this and\n\n160\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.770\nit's probably gonna be\na little bit larger.\n\n161\n00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:24.680\nSo if you're concerned about file size,\nyou may wanna go ahead and crop it.\n\n162\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.600\nMaybe go to the Edit Original option if\nyou wanna do that or even save a copy\n\n163\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.730\nof the original that you can place into\nIllustrator or something like that.\n\n164\n00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.520\nSo just do be aware of that.\n\n165\n00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.454\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and hit OK.\n\n166\n00:08:36.454 --> 00:08:39.440\nI don't really care how\nlarge my file size is today.\n\n167\n00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.160\nAnd what we can do,\n\n168\n00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.660\nthis is similar to what you would\nexpect it to look like I think.\n\n169\n00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.840\nAgain, just kind of being accustom\nto Microsoft Word, if you will.\n\n170\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.700\nYou can go ahead and just kinda drag\ninto where you want this to be cropped.\n\n171\n00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.070\nSo you can drag from corners,\nI can drag from the top to bottom,\n\n172\n00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.180\nwherever I want that to go.\n\n173\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:04.020\nSo maybe I just wanna see something\nlike that of Ollie, if you will.\n\n174\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.844\nIf you're curious, [LAUGH] Ollie.\n\n175\n00:09:05.844 --> 00:09:08.389\nIf I wanna see an example where\nI kind of just see, okay,\n\n176\n00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:10.700\nthat's a little bit tighter.\n\n177\n00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.018\nYou can understand the basic principle,\ncropping, why you would wanna do that.\n\n178\n00:09:15.018 --> 00:09:17.270\nSo to each his own, whatever you wanna do.\n\n179\n00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.580\nNow I believe two different\noptions to go ahead and set this.\n\n180\n00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.236\nOne would be to go ahead and\njust hit Apply.\n\n181\n00:09:22.236 --> 00:09:26.675\nAnd you'll see one other thing I wanted to\npoint out here is that you can see when\n\n182\n00:09:26.675 --> 00:09:29.060\nI am cropping, I have the options.\n\n183\n00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.794\nIf I need a specific width and height,\nso if I know I have to set it at that,\n\n184\n00:09:32.794 --> 00:09:34.711\nI can go ahead and type that in there.\n\n185\n00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:37.880\nAnd you can also kind of look at\nthe resolutions, so it's kind of funny.\n\n186\n00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.852\nYou can kind of change from medium\nto screen and Vonne's going whoa,\n\n187\n00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:42.682\nwhat is that?\n\n188\n00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:46.635\n[LAUGH] Yeah, and that was actually it was\none of the things that I forgot about and\n\n189\n00:09:46.635 --> 00:09:48.330\nI was just kind of looking at it.\n\n190\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.310\nYeah, so original.\n\n191\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.770\nGetting into resolution because we\nmade this smaller, you that's a higher\n\n192\n00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:59.190\nresolution, but you can kind of\nadjust that while you're cropping.\n\n193\n00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.860\nKind of an interesting\nthing to throw in there.\n\n194\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.620\nBut it is an option available to you,\n\n195\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.270\nalong with being able to set\na specific width and specific height.\n\n196\n00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.810\nSo that's the other thing I thought\nabout as I went to go hit Apply.\n\n197\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.540\nSo we have the option to hit Apply.\n\n198\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.741\nOr I believe you could also double-click,\nnope.\n\n199\n00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:15.405\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was wrong.\n\n200\n00:10:15.405 --> 00:10:18.472\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll go to button route.\n\n201\n00:10:18.472 --> 00:10:19.436\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:20.504\n&gt;&gt; We'll just figure it out somehow.\n\n203\n00:10:20.504 --> 00:10:24.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stick with the button, okay?\n\n204\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.633\n[LAUGH] This is what I say, it's new,\nI haven't used it all that often.\n\n205\n00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:32.322\nCuz the funny thing too is I don't\noften really have to use images in my\n\n206\n00:10:32.322 --> 00:10:35.328\nIllustrator file, so\nthat's one of the other things.\n\n207\n00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:38.888\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's kinda goes back\nto the old school way of thinking.\n\n208\n00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:43.878\nIf you are using Illustrator kinda like\nInDesign in my mind of where I'm doing\n\n209\n00:10:43.878 --> 00:10:48.098\njust layout in general,\nlike I'm making a poster or a flyer, and\n\n210\n00:10:48.098 --> 00:10:50.234\nI do need to have a raster image.\n\n211\n00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:53.960\nI'm so old school,\nI would make sure that I would do any\n\n212\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.250\nediting of my image\noutside of Illustrator.\n\n213\n00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.412\nAnd when I say editing, I mean cropping,\nmaking the size, changing the resolution,\n\n214\n00:11:01.412 --> 00:11:04.434\nmaking sure everything is exactly\nwhat I need for that medium,\n\n215\n00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:05.818\nwhether it's print or web.\n\n216\n00:11:05.818 --> 00:11:08.905\nAnd I don't do anything here but\njust put the image in, and\n\n217\n00:11:08.905 --> 00:11:10.930\nthen everything else goes around it.\n\n218\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.950\nMaybe add like a border, meaning,\nI draw a rectangle around it and\n\n219\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.349\nlike line it up like that.\n\n220\n00:11:16.349 --> 00:11:18.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's where, and\n\n221\n00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.480\nyou had said this in the beginning,\nthis is not a raster editing program.\n\n222\n00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.800\nThis will not give you the same\noptions that you could do to edit or\n\n223\n00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.922\nmodify this photo like\nyou have in Photoshop.\n\n224\n00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:32.872\nThere are some effects and\nsome things that you can do,\n\n225\n00:11:32.872 --> 00:11:35.540\nbut not the extent of\nPhotoshop that you can do.\n\n226\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.543\nAnd back on that resolution thing,\nthat's another thing where if\n\n227\n00:11:40.543 --> 00:11:45.930\nyou place the image, would you mind\ndemonstrating while I say this.\n\n228\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.578\nIf you do File &gt; Place,\nback from the original, right.\n\n229\n00:11:48.578 --> 00:11:49.480\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n230\n00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.570\nSo do File &gt; Place again.\n\n231\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.930\nAnd let us just go through really quickly.\n\n232\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.110\nWe go Place, find Ollie.\n\n233\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.728\n&gt;&gt; Oops, that was my kid.\n\n234\n00:11:58.728 --> 00:11:59.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n235\n00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:03.495\n&gt;&gt; And then we place this, and just click,\n\n236\n00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:05.230\nsingle-click.\n\n237\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.928\nUp at the top, do you see where it says,\nthe resolution is 72 PPI?\n\n238\n00:12:09.928 --> 00:12:10.544\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n239\n00:12:10.544 --> 00:12:14.377\nSo that means that, this is just\nthe native size of the, I think,\n\n240\n00:12:14.377 --> 00:12:17.530\nit was 3,000x4,000 pixels, and at 72.\n\n241\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.990\nJust go ahead, grab one corner and\nstart making it smaller.\n\n242\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:27.200\nAnd now we can move it up, but you can\nsee that the PPI now right here is 94.\n\n243\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.070\nSo you can see that the smaller that\nyou're making the dimensions of the photo\n\n244\n00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.270\nis increasing the resolution.\n\n245\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.810\nBecause it's just saying, all right,\nyou have a smaller width and\n\n246\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.920\nheight, my resolution's gonna go up.\n\n247\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.110\nSo this is something that you can kinda\nplay around with where it's like,\n\n248\n00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.260\nmy photo's not in a print resolution.\n\n249\n00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.820\nYou've got tons of information,\nyou can force it to be a print\n\n250\n00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:59.800\nresolution file or I guess image\nthat would be part of this file,\n\n251\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.330\nso it just kind of\nthrowing that out there.\n\n252\n00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.000\nAnd it's okay if the resolution\ngoes super high up,\n\n253\n00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.770\nbecause it's gonna eventually go down\nto 300 when you go out to print.\n\n254\n00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.486\nSo I do a lot of things\nwith commercial printing.\n\n255\n00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:13.193\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n256\n00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:15.630\nthat is why I'm kind of\nthrowing it in there and\n\n257\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.980\njust having recognized that resolution.\n\n258\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.010\nAnd also, all the different\nthings we do with export options.\n\n259\n00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.087\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If your are just doing this for web,\n\n260\n00:13:22.087 --> 00:13:26.538\nthat changes the whole file cuz you're\nnot placing an Illustrator file in your\n\n261\n00:13:26.538 --> 00:13:29.120\nwebsite, it's gonna be a JPEG imagery.\n\n262\n00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.384\nAgain, I am digressing a little bit but\nit is just my nature,\n\n263\n00:13:32.384 --> 00:13:35.456\nbecause I'm so about the resolution,\nthe file types and\n\n264\n00:13:35.456 --> 00:13:39.751\nmaking sure you understand all of that\nkind of stuff, and the color mode, too.\n\n265\n00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:40.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n266\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.002\n&gt;&gt; This is in RGB color mode.\n\n267\n00:13:42.002 --> 00:13:42.713\n&gt;&gt; RGB, mm-hm.\n\n268\n00:13:42.713 --> 00:13:47.244\n&gt;&gt; You'd probably wanna make sure that\nthis photo is in CMYK, that again,\n\n269\n00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:51.998\nI do everything outside of this program\nbecause that's just the way you're\n\n270\n00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.204\nsupposed to do it.\n\n271\n00:13:53.204 --> 00:13:55.896\n&gt;&gt; Well, Illustrator's not\nan image editing program.\n\n272\n00:13:55.896 --> 00:13:57.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nPhotoshop\n\n273\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.010\nis Adobe's image editing program.\n\n274\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.350\nSo that's why I think, to your point,\nyou have this idea that you really need to\n\n275\n00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:06.060\nfix it in another program and\nthen place it into Illustrator.\n\n276\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.450\nBecause Illustrator has many strengths,\nbut\n\n277\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.730\nthis is not what it's designed to do,\nso that's kind of important distinction.\n\n278\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nas I keep rattling off these things,\n\n279\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.900\nthe linking versus embedding,\nthat's where I've had issues with that.\n\n280\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.168\nI send somebody my Illustrative file that,\nI forgot I had all of these linked images,\n\n281\n00:14:24.168 --> 00:14:28.178\nand then it pops up on their screen, it's\nlike, It's missing all these pictures.\n\n282\n00:14:28.178 --> 00:14:29.667\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay, so\n\n283\n00:14:29.667 --> 00:14:35.550\nI would either need to embed the file or\nbut, of course, that makes it larger.\n\n284\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.770\nThey do have a package functioning here,\ndon't they?\n\n285\n00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.386\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In Illustrator?\n\n286\n00:14:39.386 --> 00:14:40.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n287\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.140\n&gt;&gt; We don't have to talk\nabout this right now, but\n\n288\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:47.390\nif you guys are familiar within design and\nthe whole concept of what packaging means,\n\n289\n00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.730\nthink about, okay,\nI have my Illustrative file.\n\n290\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.550\nAll these linked images to it,\nif you package it,\n\n291\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.970\nit makes it into a nice package,\nin a folder.\n\n292\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.450\nYou send them that whole\nfolder with the AI and\n\n293\n00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:05.970\nall the images, and then they'll have\nit all in one nice self-contained unit.\n\n294\n00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.070\nSo just thinking ahead,\n\n295\n00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.420\nif you're going to use images,\nhaving those different options.\n\n296\n00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.736\nKeep it linked but package it, or\njust embed it and make your file larger.\n\n297\n00:15:14.736 --> 00:15:18.387\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's a great point,\ncuz I think we discussed the downside of\n\n298\n00:15:18.387 --> 00:15:22.152\nembedding but we didn't really necessarily\nget into the downside of linking,\n\n299\n00:15:22.152 --> 00:15:25.270\nand that would be when your\nsending your file to someone.\n\n300\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.737\nAnd they don't have this picture\nof my cat on their desktop.\n\n301\n00:15:27.737 --> 00:15:28.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One more thing,\n\n302\n00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.790\nbecause I've done this,\nI'll move the picture.\n\n303\n00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.740\nI'll go ahead and\ntake it off my desktop and put, okay,\n\n304\n00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.030\nI need to get everything off my desktop,\ncuz I'm one of those.\n\n305\n00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.616\nI clutter it up and\nthen I file away later.\n\n306\n00:15:39.616 --> 00:15:43.140\nAnd then I open the Illustrator\nfiles like wait, what?\n\n307\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.920\nOops, [LAUGH] I put Ollie in his\nown folder, try to reorganize and\n\n308\n00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.837\nthen I forget.\n\n309\n00:15:47.837 --> 00:15:50.420\nAnd so you can always go back and\nrelink it.\n\n310\n00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n311\n00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.434\n&gt;&gt; This is linked properly.\n\n312\n00:15:53.434 --> 00:15:56.785\nBut don't you think right on\nthe linked file up at the top?\n\n313\n00:15:56.785 --> 00:16:00.656\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it should give you\nan option when you open up an Illustrator\n\n314\n00:16:00.656 --> 00:16:05.145\ndocument, I think you can double-click-\n&gt;&gt; Think its the little chain thing\n\n315\n00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:05.836\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n316\n00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:06.714\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\n\n317\n00:16:06.714 --> 00:16:09.280\n&gt;&gt; Relink\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n318\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.210\nif you were also to open up an Illustrator\ndocument and say for this instance,\n\n319\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.320\nI had moved Ollie, it would kind\nof give you that warning there,\n\n320\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.170\nand then it will prompt you\nto go ahead and relink that.\n\n321\n00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.633\nSo that's also an option there,\nit'll kind of let you know, so yeah.\n\n322\n00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:23.195\n&gt;&gt; That's all.\n\n323\n00:16:23.195 --> 00:16:26.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just want to throw all those things\n\n324\n00:16:26.088 --> 00:16:30.879\nup because everything that I've run into\nwhen working with images in Illustrator,\n\n325\n00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:33.370\nsome just putting it out there for\nyou all.\n\n326\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.590\nIn case you all are thinking about being\ndesigners, and you're trying to do\n\n327\n00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.115\nthings like that, and then you run into\nthose problems, so we're here to help.\n\n328\n00:16:40.115 --> 00:16:41.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, exactly.\n\n329\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.190\nIt makes me feel like a superhero.\n\n330\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But yeah,\n\n331\n00:16:44.659 --> 00:16:46.436\nI think that wrapped it up nicely,\n\n332\n00:16:46.436 --> 00:16:50.682\nI'm glad you kind of added those points\nthere at the end cuz it's very important.\n\n333\n00:16:50.682 --> 00:16:51.827\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm just\n\n334\n00:16:51.827 --> 00:16:53.872\nplaying around with a picture of my cat.\n\n335\n00:16:53.872 --> 00:16:55.303\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He's famous.\n\n336\n00:16:55.303 --> 00:16:57.293\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, well, I mean,\n\n337\n00:16:57.293 --> 00:17:01.309\nif y'all have been watching some of\nmy other shows you know that I do use\n\n338\n00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:06.000\nFuego and Bishop, the two spokespersons\nfor Christmas Cats Incorporated.\n\n339\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.275\nThat's the company we've made and\nwe sell Christmas cat ornaments.\n\n340\n00:17:12.275 --> 00:17:15.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah I'll buy what you're selling.\n\n341\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.557\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome,\n\n342\n00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:19.714\nwell I think we've been done a nice\nintroduction to images right here.\n\n343\n00:17:19.714 --> 00:17:24.421\nSo we're gonna go ahead and wrap this one\nup for today in a nice little package.\n\n344\n00:17:24.421 --> 00:17:26.909\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Signing off for CreativeProTV,\n\n345\n00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:29.820\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith\n&gt;&gt; And Emily Ramsey.\n\n346\n00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.740\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you

--> 00:00:15.671\nwelcome back to another exciting\nedition of CreativePro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:20.114\nI am Vonne Smith and we are continuing\non with Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n6\n00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:22.910\nAnd today we're talking about gradients.\n\n7\n00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.320\nI love me a gradient.\n\n8\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.767\nSo here to share the love is Ms.\nEmily Ramsay, hello.\n\n9\n00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.093\n&gt;&gt; Hello, you're so excited.\n\n10\n00:00:29.093 --> 00:00:29.815\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n11\n00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:30.698\n&gt;&gt; Vonne's like, yes.\n\n12\n00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:31.861\n&gt;&gt; Well, gradients.\n\n13\n00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:32.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n14\n00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.180\nit's finally we feel like we're\ngetting to a point where it's like,\n\n15\n00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.135\nthis is actually exciting.\n\n16\n00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:36.666\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.606\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think everything is exciting\n\n18\n00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:39.190\nin Illustrator.\n\n19\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190\nDon't get me wrong, but gradients,\nyou just make pretty things.\n\n20\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.670\n&gt;&gt; I know, just all the colors,\nand blending them all together.\n\n21\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.406\nIt's just like rainbows galore, because\nthat's always what I end up making,\n\n22\n00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:50.084\nis rainbows.\n\n23\n00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:52.149\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you do, yeah, I like that.\n\n24\n00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.340\nI tend to go a little more subtle,\nmaybe I'll go rainbow today.\n\n25\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.800\nSo gradients, essentially,\nif you aren't aware,\n\n26\n00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.390\nare just any time that really one\ncolor fades into another color.\n\n27\n00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.020\nAnd it doesn't even really\nhave to be just two.\n\n28\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.890\nWe'll kind of get into that.\n\n29\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.790\nYou can fade many different\ncolors into one another.\n\n30\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.110\nAnd so it's just kind of a fun thing\nthat you can do, and a nice effect.\n\n31\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.770\nIf you don't really want\njust kind of a solid color,\n\n32\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.600\nif you wanna add a little more oomph to\nit, gradients are a great way to do that.\n\n33\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.520\nSo we'll go ahead and look at that.\n\n34\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.610\nWhat I'm gonna do here is,\nI'm just gonna create a rectangle.\n\n35\n00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.700\nI know you guys are probably tired\nof seeing me create a rectangle, but\n\n36\n00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.180\nit's just a great way to\nshow off an example here.\n\n37\n00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.860\nYou can see, I'm just doing my swatches or\nmy control bar.\n\n38\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970\nI went ahead and applied a color, so\nI just have a regular black there.\n\n39\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270\nYou do have some Gradient Swatch options.\n\n40\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.414\nWe don't really need to get into those.\n\n41\n00:01:39.414 --> 00:01:43.569\nBut you do for some reason, you just wanna\ngo with something that's pre-made for you,\n\n42\n00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:44.460\nyou can do that.\n\n43\n00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.646\nBut what we're gonna do is, we're\nactually gonna create our own gradients.\n\n44\n00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:52.658\nSo you have with your gradients, you have\na Gradient Panel and a Gradient Tool.\n\n45\n00:01:52.658 --> 00:01:56.618\nAnd my advice, I would always say,\nstart with the Gradient Panel, and\n\n46\n00:01:56.618 --> 00:01:58.930\nthen use the Gradient Tool to kinda edit.\n\n47\n00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.370\nAt least, that's how I do it.\n\n48\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.531\nVonne is like, no, I don't know.\n\n49\n00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:05.175\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really, you're going that way?\n\n50\n00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:10.106\nDo tell,\nbecause I would go the other way, yeah.\n\n51\n00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:11.562\n&gt;&gt; Really, okay, so everybody has their\nown different ways for doing things.\n\n52\n00:02:11.562 --> 00:02:15.100\nWe're just gonna do it the way I do it,\nso sorry, Vonne.\n\n53\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.592\n&gt;&gt; Brosie.\n\n54\n00:02:17.592 --> 00:02:20.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] so what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.900\nstart in my Gradient panel.\n\n56\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.385\nAs you know, if you don't have your\nGradient Panel, go to Window and\n\n57\n00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:26.885\nthen I think this one is just on its own.\n\n58\n00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.615\nYes, just down there as Gradient.\n\n59\n00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.287\nSo you can go ahead and grab that.\n\n60\n00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:33.705\nI'm gonna pull mine out, so we can just\nkind of isolate that a little bit better.\n\n61\n00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:35.935\nAnd we're kind of be looking\nat a couple of things here.\n\n62\n00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:38.672\nSo we can see okay,\ngradient type, all that.\n\n63\n00:02:38.672 --> 00:02:40.852\nWhat I mainly want you\nto focus on right here,\n\n64\n00:02:40.852 --> 00:02:44.512\nis just this, what's known as\nthe gradient ramp, I believe.\n\n65\n00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:48.232\nSo it's just basically looking at\nwhite kinda fading into black.\n\n66\n00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:52.060\nSo what I'm gonna do to go ahead and\njust kind of apply a gradient to my shape.\n\n67\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.370\nNow you'll notice I have\nthe shape selected.\n\n68\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.790\nI would go ahead and\nselect the shape that you're working with.\n\n69\n00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.700\nAgain, just with your Black Arrow Tool or\nwhatever,\n\n70\n00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.910\nso you can kind of have that ready to go.\n\n71\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.170\nSo that way,\nwhen you click on your gradient slider.\n\n72\n00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.185\nI'm sorry,\nit's called gradient slider, not ramp.\n\n73\n00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.860\n&gt;&gt; I always-\n&gt;&gt; You can call it,\n\n74\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.280\nI've always called it the ramp.\n\n75\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.003\nSo that's probably why\nyou're calling it a ramp.\n\n76\n00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:10.727\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n77\n00:03:10.727 --> 00:03:12.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so she's lying to you.\n\n78\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what she's saying.\n\n79\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.220\n&gt;&gt; She's lying.\n\n80\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.294\nIt's actually the gradient slider.\n\n81\n00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:18.035\n[LAUGH] So yes, when we go out and\nclick on the slider ramp,\n\n82\n00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:21.880\nwhatever you wanna call it, you'll see\nthat you'll actually get a gradient.\n\n83\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.010\nSo hey, you've already done step one.\n\n84\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.610\nYou have created\na gradient in Illustrator.\n\n85\n00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.680\nBut we're kinda looking at\na couple of different things here.\n\n86\n00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.820\nSo I'm gonna kinda go from the top now.\n\n87\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.020\nSo we see, we have,\nby default, typeset as linear.\n\n88\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.660\nIf I was going to be using a circle,\nfor instance,\n\n89\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.830\nsay if I had a, grab my Ellipse Tool,\nsomething like this.\n\n90\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.300\nMaybe I don't wanna change\nthat type to radial, so\n\n91\n00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.750\nthat way you can kinda\nsee that effect there.\n\n92\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.970\nCertainly, just depends on what you're\ndoing, it doesn't really matter.\n\n93\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.190\nWe can also see, you can kinda\nflip these reverse gradients, so\n\n94\n00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.260\nI can reverse and\nI've kinda just moved down here\n\n95\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.520\nto this option right underneath where\nyou see the fill and the stroke kinda.\n\n96\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.820\nYou can see how I can flip those two\ngradients, so that is an option.\n\n97\n00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.788\nAnd you can also adjust the angle, okay?\n\n98\n00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:08.952\nThat was the word I was looking.\n\n99\n00:04:08.952 --> 00:04:11.550\nI wanna say skew,\nthe angle of the gradient.\n\n100\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.470\nSo what we need to focus on here, though,\nand particularly what I use the gradient\n\n101\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.880\nslider for, are these little\nhouses that you see at the bottom.\n\n102\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.910\nHouses is a term I borrowed from Vonne.\n\n103\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.770\nThey're technically\nreferred to as color stops.\n\n104\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.330\nYou see this black color stop,\nand this white color stop.\n\n105\n00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.795\nThose color stops are the actual\ncolor swatches that we have\n\n106\n00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:36.635\napplied that kind of just blend together\nto make the all the colors in between.\n\n107\n00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:39.864\nSo really, all we're working with\nright now is just two colors, and\n\n108\n00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:42.495\nIllustrator is doing all of\nthe magic in between for us.\n\n109\n00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:45.175\nSo we can go ahead and change those.\n\n110\n00:04:45.175 --> 00:04:48.573\nSo if you want something a little more\nexciting than a white and a black,\n\n111\n00:04:48.573 --> 00:04:50.624\nwhat I can do just double-click on those.\n\n112\n00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:54.833\nIf I double-click on each color swatch, so\nI'm actually clicking on the little house\n\n113\n00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:58.351\nitself, you'll see they'll either\ntake you into your Color Panel, or\n\n114\n00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:00.500\nit would take you into\nyour Swatches Panel.\n\n115\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.180\nSo if you wanna create a color on its own,\n\n116\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.370\nnot a swatch that you already are working\nwith, you do have that option for you.\n\n117\n00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.930\nYou could use the CMI case sliders there,\nor RGB, whatever color mode you're in.\n\n118\n00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.400\nI'm just gonna use my swatches.\n\n119\n00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.470\nSo maybe I'll go choose just\nkind of a random blue there.\n\n120\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.150\nNow let's say I wanna go ahead and\nadjust the white one.\n\n121\n00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.300\nSo I'm gonna double-click\non that color stop, and\n\n122\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.250\nI can go ahead and\nmake that green, for instance.\n\n123\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.310\nNow a couple things that you can do with\nthis, and I kinda pointed this out with\n\n124\n00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.495\nthe black and white, but\nit's just more fun to look at colors.\n\n125\n00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:36.240\nSo what I can see here is I\ncan adjust this slider, and\n\n126\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.165\nI may even make this kind of more\ndistinct colors just so you can see it.\n\n127\n00:05:39.165 --> 00:05:44.440\nIf I change that to pink, if I slide these\naround, you see that they actually move.\n\n128\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.550\nThat's gonna impact\nthe appearance of my gradients.\n\n129\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.450\nIf I want more pink, slide over more pink.\n\n130\n00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.460\nIf I want more blue, slide over more blue.\n\n131\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.240\nLikewise, you can use this\nlittle diamond at the top, and\n\n132\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.760\nthat's also gonna impact\nthe appearance of the color, rather.\n\n133\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.900\nSo that's another option that\nyou have available to you.\n\n134\n00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.033\nNow we mentioned you're\nnot just stuck with two.\n\n135\n00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:09.630\nYou could have 25 colors in\na gradient if you wanted to.\n\n136\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.200\nHow are you gonna go ahead and add those?\n\n137\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.780\nWell, you'll notice, even right now just\nhovered between the two color stops,\n\n138\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.680\nI've a little plus sign on my cursor.\n\n139\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.764\nSo you see, I have that white cursor\nwith a little plus sign next to it.\n\n140\n00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:25.210\nAny time you hover between the two color\nstops, the two houses, whatever you wanna\n\n141\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.340\ncall them, you can go ahead and just kind\nof single-click anywhere in that space.\n\n142\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.570\nYou're not clicking on the ramp itself or\nthe slider itself, but just below it, and\n\n143\n00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.216\nyou can go ahead and add a color stop.\n\n144\n00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:35.995\nNow by default,\n\n145\n00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:40.385\nthe color it's gonna add is just kind\nof whatever was blending right there.\n\n146\n00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:42.335\nSo I got a kind of a weird pinkish blue,\nso\n\n147\n00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.045\nyou don't really see anything different.\n\n148\n00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:45.855\nBut again, I can change this color.\n\n149\n00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:49.965\nSo I can double-click, and\nI can go ahead and add an orange in there.\n\n150\n00:06:49.965 --> 00:06:52.795\nAnd you can kind of see how\nthat all starts to fade and\n\n151\n00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:54.945\nwhere some of the moving comes in.\n\n152\n00:06:54.945 --> 00:06:59.580\nNow I have two diamonds at the top that I\ncan use to kind of adjust that color, and\n\n153\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.760\nthings like that.\n\n154\n00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.530\nYou may also be noticing this opacity\noption at the bottom, so I could click on\n\n155\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.920\nthis blue color stalk, for instance,\nand I could adjust the opacity down.\n\n156\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.130\nSo if I wanted to make that appear\na little bit more transparent,\n\n157\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.210\nthat's what opacity does for you.\n\n158\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.620\nThe nice thing about this is\nit's not adding white to it,\n\n159\n00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.680\nit's actually kind of fading into nothing.\n\n160\n00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.250\nYou can kind of see that when I move\nit over here, that it will just kinda\n\n161\n00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.140\nfade out into nothingness,\nif you will, if you were so inclined.\n\n162\n00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.186\nI'm gonna keep that set at 100.\n\n163\n00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:33.850\nAnd you can see how that looks.\n\n164\n00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.740\nNow I mentioned there was a Gradient Tool.\n\n165\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.750\nNow what does your Gradient Tool do, or\n\n166\n00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.270\nat least how I typically\nwould use my Gradient Tool?\n\n167\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.340\nYou have that option to change\nthe angle in your Gradient Panel.\n\n168\n00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.880\nI use my Gradient Tool\nto change the angle, and\n\n169\n00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.130\nI really think this is\nwhere it gets kind of fun.\n\n170\n00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.690\nSo by default, you just kind of have those\ncolors there in a block, linear, radial,\n\n171\n00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.780\nhowever you wanna do it.\n\n172\n00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.380\nBut you can really make some kind\nof smooth looking adjustments.\n\n173\n00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.870\nI can take these three colors\nthat look kinda rainbow-y, and\n\n174\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.610\nreally smooth it out\nwith my Gradient Tool.\n\n175\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.500\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and do my Gradient\nTool, that's a cap key G on my keyboard.\n\n176\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.860\nAnd what you'll see by\ndefault you get this.\n\n177\n00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.650\nThat slider's basically just\nindicating to you what you had.\n\n178\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.760\nYou could go ahead and move things around.\n\n179\n00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.070\nWhat I like to use the Gradient Tool for\nthere, is I like to click, hold, and\n\n180\n00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.840\ndrag and\nadjust the direction of my gradient.\n\n181\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.590\nSo I'll click,\n\n182\n00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.720\nhold and drag over here, and see how\nthat just kinda smooths out the colors.\n\n183\n00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.289\nIt's less of that harsh\ncontrast that you saw before.\n\n184\n00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:38.900\nCuz what you'll notice as I click,\nhold and\n\n185\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.480\ndrag way outside my shape,\nI'm not even necessarily confined to.\n\n186\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.324\nOkay, I want it to go up and down.\n\n187\n00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:47.480\nSo this is a great way,\nif you want sopmething to go up and down.\n\n188\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.450\nGoing specifically just\nkind of within that.\n\n189\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.690\nI might do something way out here.\n\n190\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.650\nAnd then you can kind of use your tool.\n\n191\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.640\nSee how you can kind of move those\ncolor stops there if you need to.\n\n192\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.920\nSo that way, again, that's how I say kinda\nmore smoothing it out with that option.\n\n193\n00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.220\nSo that's definitely something\nthat I'm a big fan of.\n\n194\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.967\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then also like\nwhere you started the drag and\n\n195\n00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:14.264\nwhere you stopped the drag,\nyou can see it went from pink to blue.\n\n196\n00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:18.480\nBut you just did it,\nwhere I wanted to go left is blue,\n\n197\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.320\nright is pink, we'll start from\nthe right and drag the other way.\n\n198\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.010\nSo it's the start and\n\n199\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.035\nstop is what it actually looks like\nin the ramp on your Gradient Panel.\n\n200\n00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.310\nSo that's the direction.\n\n201\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.185\nAnd if you also made it really small,\nlike a tiny little line, then that's still\n\n202\n00:09:34.185 --> 00:09:38.540\ngonna go ahead and give you, yeah,\nwhere the gradient starts and stops.\n\n203\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.400\nAnd at the other end,\nit's just gonna do the solid color.\n\n204\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.610\nSo it's a really neat way of being\nable to control how much it gradiates,\n\n205\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.553\nI don't think it's a real word.\n\n206\n00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:50.706\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, we'll use that.\n\n207\n00:09:50.706 --> 00:09:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Is it.\n\n208\n00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.949\n&gt;&gt; Well, no.\n\n209\n00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:54.568\n[LAUGH] I'm just saying I decide it is.\n\n210\n00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:55.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] To make me feel better!\n\n211\n00:09:55.765 --> 00:09:57.231\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:59.081\n&gt;&gt; You've been around me way too long,\n\n213\n00:09:59.081 --> 00:10:03.040\ntoo many years to know, yeah,\nthat's a word, because Vonne made it up.\n\n214\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.660\n&gt;&gt; Sounds right.\n\n215\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.440\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny because that's where\nI always go to the Gradient Tool, and\n\n216\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.820\ndo all the same things that you\njust did in the Gradient Panel,\n\n217\n00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.880\nwith the houses adding, dropping.\n\n218\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.550\nWe should probably talk about\ndropping a color, right?\n\n219\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.620\nSo if I didn't want the red in between.\n\n220\n00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes, deleting a color.\n\n221\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n222\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.003\n&gt;&gt; You said dropping,\nI'm going, what does that mean?\n\n223\n00:10:23.003 --> 00:10:25.490\nDelete, yes, I think of it as deleting.\n\n224\n00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.640\nBut yes, yes, yes.\n\n225\n00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.455\nAnd I call it dropping it from the ramp.\n\n226\n00:10:28.455 --> 00:10:30.430\n&gt;&gt; Then that's make sense.\n\n227\n00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wait, it's a slider.\n\n228\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.580\nI'm never gonna get that.\n\n229\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.460\nIt's gonna be a ramp.\n\n230\n00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.649\nSorry I've been doing it for\nway too many years of calling it a ramp.\n\n231\n00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:39.614\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Stick with what you know.\n\n232\n00:10:39.614 --> 00:10:41.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think it works fine but yeah,\n\n233\n00:10:41.861 --> 00:10:42.970\nyou bring up a great point.\n\n234\n00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.187\nWhat if, and I mentioned that earlier when\nwe were talking about adding a color,\n\n235\n00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.857\nwhat if I don't like this color anymore?\n\n236\n00:10:47.857 --> 00:10:51.270\nI'm over this orange, okay,\nor I'm over this blue.\n\n237\n00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.840\nWhat if I wanna get rid of it?\n\n238\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.400\nAny of the colors whether\nyou've added them or not, or\n\n239\n00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.020\nthey were one of the two original houses,\nyou can delete, or drop.\n\n240\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.435\nI see why she's calling it dropping,\n\n241\n00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:03.040\nbecause that's basically\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n242\n00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.830\nWe're just gonna click,\nhold, and drag down.\n\n243\n00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.890\nYou need to kind of\ndrop it off that slide,\n\n244\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.700\nor drop it off that ramp, whatever\nyou wanna call it, to each his own.\n\n245\n00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.163\nSo I'm gonna click on this\nparticular color stop, this blue,\n\n246\n00:11:15.163 --> 00:11:19.220\nhold and drag down to go ahead and\ndelete that color stop.\n\n247\n00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.720\nNow you'll see how that impacted my shape.\n\n248\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.850\nI may wanna go ahead here,\nwhether in my slider or my tool, and\n\n249\n00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.970\nkind of adjust the way\nthat that's gonna look.\n\n250\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.230\nAnd you'll see here,\n\n251\n00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.960\nit's interesting the different types\nof effects that you can get with this.\n\n252\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.820\nSo you can have something\nthat's really subtle like this.\n\n253\n00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.480\nAnd typically,\nif I'm designing something professionally,\n\n254\n00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.620\nI'm gonna go with a more subtle gradient.\n\n255\n00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.360\nI'm not gonna use a rainbow,\nif you will, but yeah.\n\n256\n00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.440\n&gt;&gt; And that's actually why,\nwhen I'm demonstrating,\n\n257\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.915\nteaching the concept of a gradient,\nI always go crazy with the rainbows.\n\n258\n00:11:50.915 --> 00:11:55.574\nCuz I can't really do that in my\nprofessional life, like you're saying, and\n\n259\n00:11:55.574 --> 00:11:59.610\nvery subtle from a dark green to\na little bit lighter shade of green.\n\n260\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.625\nAnd it's funny, if you start\nlooking at things as designers,\n\n261\n00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:06.110\nyou know I look at all sorts of stuff.\n\n262\n00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.750\nLook at that subtle gradient they have.\n\n263\n00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.320\nIt really kind of adds a little bit\nmore dimension, if you wanna say.\n\n264\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.250\nI know right now it's kind of all flat\ncolor, flat colors are back in style.\n\n265\n00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.330\nBut for the longest time,\nthe gradients and\n\n266\n00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.160\nthe kind of shading that you could do\nwith the gradient was all the rage.\n\n267\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:23.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n268\n00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.297\n&gt;&gt; But now it's not, it's actually\na little easier as a designer,\n\n269\n00:12:26.297 --> 00:12:27.975\nit's like everything's flat colors, yay.\n\n270\n00:12:27.975 --> 00:12:29.272\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n271\n00:12:29.272 --> 00:12:32.539\nI definitely agree everything's flat\ncolor, which I sometimes think is easier\n\n272\n00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:35.422\nbecause I don't have to go through\nthe effort to create a gradient, but\n\n273\n00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.688\nI would say a subtle gradient.\n\n274\n00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:40.370\nLike, really subtle gradients,\nyou'll still find.\n\n275\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.940\nAnd it's funny, they're so subtle,\noftentimes you don't notice it.\n\n276\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.720\nBut if you take that and kinda to your\npoint, it just adds a little oomph to it.\n\n277\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.950\nIf I compare this to just,\nlike a pink square or\n\n278\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.470\nan orange or,\nI forget exactly what colors it is.\n\n279\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:59.230\nThis isn't the world's most subtle\ngradient that we've ever created, but\n\n280\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:04.700\nyou can see how it just adds a little\nbit of something, something in there.\n\n281\n00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.080\nSo if I just did two oranges here,\nyou can kinda see, okay,\n\n282\n00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.440\nthat's just slightly different,\nslight more emphasis there.\n\n283\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.180\nSo one thing I did wanna note is\nthat I can actually save this.\n\n284\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:21.060\nSo very similar to saving a swatch,\nif I wanna use this again,\n\n285\n00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.550\nI can go ahead and just same way\nthat we created new swatches,\n\n286\n00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.640\nI can click on that Post-It note icon.\n\n287\n00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.750\nThere's no reason why you can't save\na Gradient swatch the same way that you\n\n288\n00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.570\nwould save another one.\n\n289\n00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.290\nSo I can go ahead and click on New Swatch.\n\n290\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.730\nGo ahead and do New Gradient Swatch,\n\n291\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.985\nyou can IT give a name if you were so\ninclined.\n\n292\n00:13:36.985 --> 00:13:38.735\nAnd you can go ahead and use that later.\n\n293\n00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.404\nSo I can go ahead and apply that here.\n\n294\n00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:45.132\n&gt;&gt; And it's based off of the audit that\nyou had selected that has the gradient\n\n295\n00:13:45.132 --> 00:13:50.013\nfill applied and you're saying,\nlet's go ahead and save that for later and\n\n296\n00:13:50.013 --> 00:13:51.325\nmakE a new swatch.\n\n297\n00:13:51.325 --> 00:13:54.155\nDoes it really connect\nwith the Gradient Panel?\n\n298\n00:13:54.155 --> 00:13:57.789\nNot necessarily, it's just whatever's on,\nwhatever's selected.\n\n299\n00:13:57.789 --> 00:14:00.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that becomes the swatch.\n\n300\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good point.\n\n301\n00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:06.000\nSo I did go ahead and select that there\nbefore I made my new Gradient swatch.\n\n302\n00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.790\nIt's not pulling from the Gradient Panel.\n\n303\n00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.440\nSo and I'll even do this one cuz this\none's a little more of a dramatic example.\n\n304\n00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.450\nSo now you can see,\nI think I can go ahead and apply that.\n\n305\n00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.530\nAnd what you'll notice is\nsometimes with the actual like\n\n306\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.720\nangle formatting doesn't copy.\n\n307\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.670\nA lot of times it's really just\nthe specific colors that will copy over.\n\n308\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.124\nSo that's one thing that you\nmight wanna pay attention to.\n\n309\n00:14:25.124 --> 00:14:27.299\nYou'll probably still\nhave to use that tool,\n\n310\n00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:30.380\nand all that to fit in with it,\nbecause all shapes are different.\n\n311\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.360\nIf I have a shape,\na rectangle that's smaller,\n\n312\n00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.000\nif I have this on a circle,\nit's just naturally gonna look different.\n\n313\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.410\nLast thing I wanted to point out was\nthat I can actually apply a gradient to\n\n314\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:40.030\na stroke.\n\n315\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.680\nSo they're not limited just to fills.\n\n316\n00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.650\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm just gonna go in my toolbar.\n\n317\n00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.360\nAnd I'm gonna swap the fill and\nthe strokes.\n\n318\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.970\nSee those double pointed arrows?\n\n319\n00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.170\nI'm gonna go ahead and swap those.\n\n320\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.140\nSo this is pretty small.\n\n321\n00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.970\nSo you can't see it right now.\n\n322\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.552\nBut if I increase the size of my stroke,\n\n323\n00:14:54.552 --> 00:14:58.810\ndouble band,\nyou can see I have that option here.\n\n324\n00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.560\nAnd I can kind of edit\nthis in my Gradient Panel.\n\n325\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.880\nSo right now when I pull\nup my Gradient panel,\n\n326\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.060\nyou're probably like, Emily,\nwe don't have the option to edit.\n\n327\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.690\nBut what you can do,\nif I go ahead and select that stroke,\n\n328\n00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.160\nit's kind of like going\nback to our Swatches Panel.\n\n329\n00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.780\nIf you selected the fill color\nversus the stroke color,\n\n330\n00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.450\nthat changed while you were editing.\n\n331\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.920\nIn this case, I'm gonna select my stroke.\n\n332\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.282\nJust go ahead and\ngrab that so it's on top, and\n\n333\n00:15:22.282 --> 00:15:24.470\nthen now I have these\noptions to adjust it.\n\n334\n00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.940\nSo you can basically just\nadjust the way that it flows,\n\n335\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.410\nkind of like the way you would use\nthe Gradient Tool in your fill.\n\n336\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.130\nSo I can change this to go from\napply gradient within stroke,\n\n337\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:39.438\nto apply gradient along stroke or\napply gradient across stroke.\n\n338\n00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:43.859\nAnd you can kind of see the slight\ndifferences in there in the way that it's\n\n339\n00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:45.507\nkind of change your angle.\n\n340\n00:15:45.507 --> 00:15:48.380\nNow I don't actually remember.\n\n341\n00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.490\nCan I use my Gradient Tool with this?\n\n342\n00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.707\nNo, you automatically when you pull up\nyour Gradient Tool, if you're trying to\n\n343\n00:15:54.707 --> 00:15:59.120\nadjust say a stroke color, you're gonna\nget that circle with the line, the nasty.\n\n344\n00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.253\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n345\n00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:03.025\nthis is me being the old\ngrandma over here.\n\n346\n00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:09.040\nBack in my day, you couldn't apply\na gradient directly to a stroke.\n\n347\n00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.389\nYou had to do all these weird like\ncompound pass, and it has to be a fill,\n\n348\n00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:15.070\nbut it looks like a stroke.\n\n349\n00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:21.930\nSo this is from somebody that's coming\nfrom way back, this is pretty awesome.\n\n350\n00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:26.500\nNow it's been around for I think quite\na few years, quite a few iterations, but\n\n351\n00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.820\nto have all of these\noptions right here for\n\n352\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.860\na stroke with a gradient,\nit's pretty amazing.\n\n353\n00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.828\nSo I was very happy when\nthey added that too.\n\n354\n00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.887\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's always exciting when Illustrator\n\n355\n00:16:38.887 --> 00:16:41.265\nor Adobe adds something and\nyou're just like yes.\n\n356\n00:16:41.265 --> 00:16:44.591\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't wanna go too far ahead because\n\n357\n00:16:44.591 --> 00:16:49.195\nI know it wasn't on our little agenda,\nbut just to kinda re-emphasize,\n\n358\n00:16:49.195 --> 00:16:52.239\nwhen we went over the swatch libraries,\nright,\n\n359\n00:16:52.239 --> 00:16:55.928\nyou have a whole bunch of\npre-made gradients in there.\n\n360\n00:16:55.928 --> 00:16:57.053\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So do we mind if\n\n361\n00:16:57.053 --> 00:16:58.860\nwe show them really quickly?\n\n362\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can demonstrate, absolutely.\n\n363\n00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.820\n&gt;&gt; So what we can do here,\nwe can go into our swatch libraries.\n\n364\n00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.900\nRemember that from our Swatches Panel we\ncan go into the bottom left-hand corner.\n\n365\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.470\nIt looks like a stack of books.\n\n366\n00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.330\nClick on that and then you do have\nthe Gradient option, and whoa,\n\n367\n00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.710\nthey have a lot more options\nthan I thought that they did.\n\n368\n00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.350\nI remembered things like they have metals,\n\n369\n00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.870\nwhich is kind of interesting\nif you want a metal effect.\n\n370\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.970\nBut I totally forgot about all the brights\nand pull up color combinations.\n\n371\n00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:30.240\nYou got like, gonna select that.\n\n372\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.104\nKey thing I wanna point out note,\nI have my stroke applied, and\n\n373\n00:17:33.104 --> 00:17:34.032\nmy stroke is on top.\n\n374\n00:17:34.032 --> 00:17:36.492\n&gt;&gt; I was like something's gone.\n\n375\n00:17:36.492 --> 00:17:37.606\nWhat are we doing?\n\n376\n00:17:37.606 --> 00:17:41.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're sitting there like both of\nour heads are like, what's going wrong?\n\n377\n00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.570\nI have my stroke on top, not my fill.\n\n378\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.340\nThat's why I'm not\nseeing any change there.\n\n379\n00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.170\nSo yeah, fun fact if you ever do that for\nyourself, that's what's gonna happen.\n\n380\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.451\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, you can [INAUDIBLE] more.\n\n381\n00:17:49.451 --> 00:17:52.767\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is some and I like because\nit gives me like a base to start with,\n\n382\n00:17:52.767 --> 00:17:54.557\nlike ooh, I really like this sunset, or\n\n383\n00:17:54.557 --> 00:17:56.839\nwhatever this one that we\nhave selected right now.\n\n384\n00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:59.469\nBut I kinda want to\nchange that one purple.\n\n385\n00:17:59.469 --> 00:18:03.368\nThen you go into the gradient, or\nI would grab the Gradient Tool, and\n\n386\n00:18:03.368 --> 00:18:06.203\nthen change the houses,\nor the stops from there.\n\n387\n00:18:06.203 --> 00:18:08.081\nAnd so\nyou can do some modifications from it.\n\n388\n00:18:08.081 --> 00:18:09.631\nSo it's a nice starting point.\n\n389\n00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.227\nThey've got so\nmany that you can choose from.\n\n390\n00:18:12.227 --> 00:18:17.336\nAnd then one other note on this one,\nif you pull up the swatch, you can see it\n\n391\n00:18:17.336 --> 00:18:22.808\nautomatically adds the swatches from\nthe libraries into your Swatches Panel.\n\n392\n00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:25.390\nAnd we talked about in\nthe swatches episodes,\n\n393\n00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.630\nthat is that swatches are file specific.\n\n394\n00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.000\nAnd the other ones with the libraries,\n\n395\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.500\nwe had to click on the folder to force\nit to be added into our swatches.\n\n396\n00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.940\nThe gradients from the library\ngoes automatically into it.\n\n397\n00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.720\nSo I just wanted to point that out.\n\n398\n00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.762\nCuz I really, really love this\nswatch libraries of gradient and\n\n399\n00:18:43.762 --> 00:18:45.513\nI like the names, fruits and vegetables.\n\n400\n00:18:45.513 --> 00:18:46.114\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n401\n00:18:46.114 --> 00:18:48.136\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know I was just thinking.\n\n402\n00:18:48.136 --> 00:18:49.126\nI was like, foliage.\n\n403\n00:18:49.126 --> 00:18:51.675\n[LAUGH] It's fall, I love it.\n\n404\n00:18:51.675 --> 00:18:52.582\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n405\n00:18:52.582 --> 00:18:53.620\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, no, that's great.\n\n406\n00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:58.050\nAnd I'm glad you mentioned that cuz\nI had forgotten about the gradient\n\n407\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.880\nswatch libraries and all that.\n\n408\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.870\nSo yeah, I think that's it.\n\n409\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:01.790\nI think that's a good,\n\n410\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.540\nagain, introduction into how to actually\ncreate a gradient and start editing one.\n\n411\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.777\nSo have fun, enjoy it,\nmake some rainbows if you want to.\n\n412\n00:19:08.777 --> 00:19:13.760\nDo all kinds of crazy stuff,\nwhatever you wanna do, so it's exciting.\n\n413\n00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.160\n&gt;&gt; Yay, well, thank you so much.\n\n414\n00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.700\nLike I said, I love me a gradient.\n\n415\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.160\nI'm feeling very, very fluffy right now,\nvery colorful and everything.\n\n416\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.668\nAnd so we're gonna go ahead, and\nthat's probably a good place for us to,\n\n417\n00:19:23.668 --> 00:19:26.510\nif Vonne's getting colorful,\nwe need to wrap this one up.\n\n418\n00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.094\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n419\n00:19:28.094 --> 00:19:32.850\nSigning off for CreativePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n420\n00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.720\nAnd I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n421\n00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:39.819\n&gt;&gt; And

--> 00:00:20.098\nI'm your host Vonne Smith, and we're\ncontinuing on with Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n4\n00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:23.626\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\nbe talking about text effects,\n\n5\n00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:26.185\nnot just regular text but\nthe effects of text.\n\n6\n00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:28.389\nWow, I said that and\ndidn't trip up and that's pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:32.027\nSo here to help us is Ms.\nEmily Ramsey, hello how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:34.421\n&gt;&gt; Hello, good,\nI like how you phrased that.\n\n9\n00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:39.371\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes I was more thinking along\nthe lines of okay, how am I gonna explain\n\n10\n00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:44.179\nthis, this is kind of like object\ntransformation, but with your text?\n\n11\n00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:45.521\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n12\n00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:48.552\nWe're gonna fancy up our text,\njust not in a straight line.\n\n13\n00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:51.109\nWe're gonna go crazy,\nwe're gonna go circular.\n\n14\n00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.556\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:53.824\n&gt;&gt; Check it out, yes.\n\n16\n00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:55.872\n[LAUGH] I know you're excited now, right?\n\n17\n00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:59.859\nSo yes, basically what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna be looking at some of\n\n18\n00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.824\nthe various, different effects for\n\n19\n00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:05.267\nlack of a better word that we can\nplace specifically on our text.\n\n20\n00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.699\nNow sometimes you can take things\nthat you would typically do for\n\n21\n00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:09.239\nan object and also apply it to your text.\n\n22\n00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.376\nBut these are gonna be things\nthat are really type specific.\n\n23\n00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:16.074\nSo what we're gonna look at, we're\ngonna look at the type on a path tool,\n\n24\n00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:17.936\nwhich is pretty fun and pretty neat.\n\n25\n00:01:17.936 --> 00:01:22.301\nAnd then we're also gonna look at\nthe touch type tool which are one of\n\n26\n00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:25.070\nthe fairly newer options in Illustrator.\n\n27\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.144\nAnd then also talk about outlining out\ntext and really kind of what that means,\n\n28\n00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:29.229\nand what you can do with it.\n\n29\n00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.501\nSo we'll go ahead and\nget started with the type on a path.\n\n30\n00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:36.598\nSo let's go ahead and jump into my\ncomputer, and the first thing that we need\n\n31\n00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:39.493\nto do is actually create a path for\nour type to type on.\n\n32\n00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:43.460\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna actually show the example of\n\n33\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.054\na circle.\n\n34\n00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:46.373\nRather than using a perfect circle though,\n\n35\n00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:50.209\nI'm probably gonna do something that's\na little bit more like an oval.\n\n36\n00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.896\nCuz what it's gonna do for us is it's\ngonna allow our text to have kind\n\n37\n00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:57.156\nof more of a place to go, so\nmore of a place to rest if you will.\n\n38\n00:01:57.156 --> 00:02:00.657\nSo I'm gonna go and\ngrab my ellipse tool, and\n\n39\n00:02:00.657 --> 00:02:05.182\nthen once I get that I'm gonna\ngo ahead and make that oval.\n\n40\n00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:08.219\nAnd then you can go ahead and\njust go back to your black arrow tool,\n\n41\n00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.775\nkinda go back into your neutral.\n\n42\n00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:13.996\nNow, something that Vaughn and I were\ntalking about a second ago is I'm gonna go\n\n43\n00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:16.267\nahead here and change this fill to yellow.\n\n44\n00:02:16.267 --> 00:02:18.728\nSo that way you can see the path\noutlined a little bit better.\n\n45\n00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:21.124\nAnd I think that that's gonna\nmake a distinction for you.\n\n46\n00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:24.205\nSo once of the things that can\nkinda trip you up with this is kind\n\n47\n00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:27.183\nof being able to see the path and\nit trips me up, it just did.\n\n48\n00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:30.993\nSo it happens to everybody, but\nfrom here once we have our path\n\n49\n00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:35.779\nactually created we need to go ahead of\ncourse grab out our type on a path tool.\n\n50\n00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.500\nSo I'm gonna go back to\nthat type tool the T.\n\n51\n00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.011\nAnd then when you click and\nhold on it you'll see okay,\n\n52\n00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:42.659\nI've got my hidden options there.\n\n53\n00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.542\nThe type tool has a lot of\nhidden options underneath it.\n\n54\n00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:48.909\nWe're just gonna go straight\ninto that type on a path option.\n\n55\n00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.105\nSo once you get that you see\nyou have your little cursor,\n\n56\n00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:53.131\nkinda looks like an I with\na little wave through it.\n\n57\n00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:57.566\nSo it's the typical, type cursor, but then\nyou have that wave through that's kind of\n\n58\n00:02:57.566 --> 00:03:00.267\nindicating okay,\nyou can kind of do a fun path here.\n\n59\n00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:06.154\nNow, here's kind of the part that trips me\nup, is knowing exactly where that path is.\n\n60\n00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:07.862\nSo what you'll see if you try and\n\n61\n00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:10.910\nclick over here,\nyou're gonna get this error message.\n\n62\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.536\nYou must click on a non path comp,\ncmpound non-masking path, blah blah blah.\n\n63\n00:03:14.536 --> 00:03:18.188\nAnd you're probably thinking, what does\nthat even mean, like I have no idea.\n\n64\n00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:20.514\nLikewise, if I try and\nclick just slightly off,\n\n65\n00:03:20.514 --> 00:03:24.279\nwhich seems to be the issue that I tend\nto have, I'm gonna get that same thing.\n\n66\n00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:27.870\nYou need to make sure that you're clicking\nexactly on the outside of that path, and\n\n67\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.321\nit's a very subtle difference.\n\n68\n00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.240\nYou'll see, we were talking either,\nI think it used to have a little bit\n\n69\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.822\nmore of a-\n&gt;&gt; I thought there was some visual\n\n70\n00:03:35.822 --> 00:03:39.655\nindication with the mouse\ncursor icon to let you know,\n\n71\n00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:41.888\nI found the path to attach myself.\n\n72\n00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.162\nI mean it makes sense.\n\n73\n00:03:43.162 --> 00:03:43.763\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n74\n00:03:43.763 --> 00:03:47.184\n&gt;&gt; But I really felt like there\nwas another visual indication.\n\n75\n00:03:47.184 --> 00:03:49.455\nI might also be crossing\nstreams with InDesign.\n\n76\n00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:51.432\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To where I kept doing this,\n\n77\n00:03:51.432 --> 00:03:53.953\nI'd put parentheses around it or\nsomething.\n\n78\n00:03:53.953 --> 00:03:57.153\nI don't know, but yeah,\nnow it's just saying, okay,\n\n79\n00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.568\nit's kinda highlighting it and\nit's saying the word path.\n\n80\n00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:01.093\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n81\n00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:03.834\n&gt;&gt; Which are hovered over the stroke or\noutside.\n\n82\n00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:05.603\nIt's not the inside, cuz it can't go in.\n\n83\n00:04:05.603 --> 00:04:11.187\nIt's gotta be right on the outline if\nyou wanna say of whatever path you have.\n\n84\n00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:13.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a little weird, so.\n\n85\n00:04:13.134 --> 00:04:15.278\n&gt;&gt; It's a little weird, I agree.\n\n86\n00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:19.083\nThankfully, that's one of the more\ndifficult things that we're gonna have to\n\n87\n00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:21.026\ndeal here, the rest is just kind of fun.\n\n88\n00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:22.973\nSo we're gonna go ahead and click, and\n\n89\n00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:26.823\nthen once you do that actually on the path\nagain look for that pink path there.\n\n90\n00:04:26.823 --> 00:04:29.607\nYou can see just like our regular\ntext is gonna go ahead and\n\n91\n00:04:29.607 --> 00:04:31.177\nfill it in without lorem ipsum.\n\n92\n00:04:31.177 --> 00:04:33.906\nWhich I know is probably funny\nto you if you're not accustom\n\n93\n00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.207\nto using this in recent\nversions of illustrator.\n\n94\n00:04:36.207 --> 00:04:38.322\nAnd then from there, of course you\njust go ahead and start typing.\n\n95\n00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:40.776\nAnd just as you normally\nwould with your regular type.\n\n96\n00:04:40.776 --> 00:04:44.499\nSo, I can go ahead and say,\nHello my name is Emily,\n\n97\n00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:48.846\nand you'll see how that will\nkind of wrap around our shape.\n\n98\n00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:51.283\nYou can see maybe why I used an oval,\n\n99\n00:04:51.283 --> 00:04:55.191\nbecause I wanted to give more\nof a platform for that text.\n\n100\n00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:58.968\nAnd you'll also see what happened here\nis after I typed that, I was like, okay,\n\n101\n00:04:58.968 --> 00:05:02.428\nI should have probably started a little\nfarther over to the left, right.\n\n102\n00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:05.135\nSo that way I could have\nhad all of that over.\n\n103\n00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:07.929\nThat is fixable, it's not something\nthat you have to go back and\n\n104\n00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:09.830\nsay, no, I have to start over.\n\n105\n00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.840\nWhat we're gonna do from here is\nactually everything's gonna be\n\n106\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.080\ndone in our black air tool.\n\n107\n00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.456\nOnce you get your type set the way you\nwant it, like if I wanna go ahead here and\n\n108\n00:05:18.456 --> 00:05:22.328\nchange my font size or\nfont type or whatever I wanna do.\n\n109\n00:05:22.328 --> 00:05:26.339\nIf I wanna do something kind of crazy,\nthis is where I get into the weeds and\n\n110\n00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:29.530\nI start getting really into fonts and\ntrying to pick them.\n\n111\n00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.895\nSo I'm pretty much just\ngonna leave that as is.\n\n112\n00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:33.038\nWe'll stick with Myriad Pro.\n\n113\n00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:36.552\nBut know that that's an option that you\ncan otherwise it'll take me ten years to\n\n114\n00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:37.242\nchoose a font.\n\n115\n00:05:37.242 --> 00:05:41.086\nSo, from here, once you have that set,\nyou change the color, all that.\n\n116\n00:05:41.086 --> 00:05:43.083\nNow I can go back into\nmy black arrow tool, and\n\n117\n00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:44.722\nthis is where the fun really begins.\n\n118\n00:05:44.722 --> 00:05:49.237\nSo, what you're gonna see, if you can\nkinda take a look at this for me and\n\n119\n00:05:49.237 --> 00:05:53.825\nI'll kinda try and use my fancy like\nzoom tricks that Vonne has taught me,\n\n120\n00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:55.327\nto look at these lines.\n\n121\n00:05:55.327 --> 00:05:58.026\nThat's where we're gonna go ahead and\nget started here.\n\n122\n00:05:58.026 --> 00:06:01.123\nNow, I wish I had a better\nway of describing this.\n\n123\n00:06:01.123 --> 00:06:04.615\nBut basically what we're gonna be looking\nlooking at, is we're gonna be looking at\n\n124\n00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:07.777\nthe lines with the boxes on them versus\nthe straight line with nothing on it.\n\n125\n00:06:07.777 --> 00:06:11.578\nVonne may be able to tell me if there's\nlike a better name for that but\n\n126\n00:06:11.578 --> 00:06:15.663\nthat's what I go with for this, so\nthe lines with the boxes around them.\n\n127\n00:06:15.663 --> 00:06:18.893\nOne thing to point out, I'm saying\nthe lines with the boxes around them so\n\n128\n00:06:18.893 --> 00:06:22.241\nthat I can distinguish it, you don't\nwanna click on the boxes themselves.\n\n129\n00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:23.584\nThat's gonna do something\na little bit different.\n\n130\n00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:25.392\nYou wanna make sure to click on that line.\n\n131\n00:06:25.392 --> 00:06:27.871\nBut when you do, what it's gonna do for\n\n132\n00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:31.417\nyou is it's gonna allow you\nto rotate that text around.\n\n133\n00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:36.022\nNow, the kind of funny thing with this is\nthat you have keep the text within those\n\n134\n00:06:36.022 --> 00:06:36.723\ntwo lines.\n\n135\n00:06:36.723 --> 00:06:38.465\nSee how when I'm going over that?\n\n136\n00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:42.369\nThat starts to give me that little red\nplus sign that's letting me know that I\n\n137\n00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:43.409\nhave overset text.\n\n138\n00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:46.299\nWe haven't, I don't think really think\nabout over that text at this point if\n\n139\n00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:47.553\nyou're watching this in order.\n\n140\n00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:50.014\nBut it is something that\nyou've had to be aware off.\n\n141\n00:06:50.014 --> 00:06:54.089\n&gt;&gt; This is where I would say it's like\npushing the train down the track.\n\n142\n00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:55.608\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's like this is the chu-chu train and\n\n143\n00:06:55.608 --> 00:06:56.218\nhere's the track.\n\n144\n00:06:56.218 --> 00:07:01.314\nSo we're gonna push the train down but\nonce you get to that end it's\n\n145\n00:07:01.314 --> 00:07:06.246\nlike you are track and\nit's going in a tunnel I literally use it.\n\n146\n00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:08.104\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're going in the tunnel, but\n\n147\n00:07:08.104 --> 00:07:10.508\nyou don't want that to be in the times,\nand you can't see, so\n\n148\n00:07:10.508 --> 00:07:11.769\nyou got back the train back out.\n\n149\n00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:13.784\nAnd where the track starts, and\n\n150\n00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:17.299\nends, that's what I call\nthose little guys out there.\n\n151\n00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:20.668\n&gt;&gt; I loved that, yes, exactly,\nokay, yes, so like a train,\n\n152\n00:07:20.668 --> 00:07:23.192\nthink about like that in a tunnel,\nI love it.\n\n153\n00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:27.185\nBut what you maybe thinking okay, I need\nto move this further over to the left.\n\n154\n00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:28.967\nWhat does it really do for me here?\n\n155\n00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:34.277\nAnd so what you have to do this other\ny here it's flexible, it can move.\n\n156\n00:07:34.277 --> 00:07:38.329\nSo what we can do, we just have to move\nthat over further over to the left.\n\n157\n00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:41.194\nSo that way I can move this\none further over to the left.\n\n158\n00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:45.017\nAnd then now we have the option okay,\nthat looks a little bit more centered,\n\n159\n00:07:45.017 --> 00:07:48.266\nyou can kinda just fidget with it\nuntil you get where it likes it.\n\n160\n00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:51.093\nNow, part of the reason why I\nused the example of a circle.\n\n161\n00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:54.399\nSay for example, I've got this and\nit looks good but\n\n162\n00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:57.571\nwhat if I wanted it to be\non the bottom of my circle?\n\n163\n00:07:57.571 --> 00:08:00.143\nWhat if I wanted it to be down here,\nright?\n\n164\n00:08:00.143 --> 00:08:04.861\nWell, you can rotate your text\nall the way around to the bottom.\n\n165\n00:08:04.861 --> 00:08:07.105\nAnd that's fine, that's great.\n\n166\n00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:10.561\nBut the issue is, unless you can read\nupside-down, unless you're a bat,\n\n167\n00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:13.680\nbasically [LAUGH] it's going\nto give you some problems.\n\n168\n00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.504\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\n169\n00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:18.251\nAnd whoops, I'm getting a little\nwonky over here with my mouse and\n\n170\n00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:20.080\ndragging this all around.\n\n171\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.932\nThat is where that other little\nmysterious plane line is gonna come in.\n\n172\n00:08:24.932 --> 00:08:28.134\nSo we kind of move around to your\nheart's content with those two,\n\n173\n00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:30.440\nthe lines with the boxes around them.\n\n174\n00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.850\nAnd then now this is the only\nother thing that trips people up,\n\n175\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.220\nwith this is this kind of moving in and\nout and that's what's gonna be done here.\n\n176\n00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.850\nSo for this one, what you wanna do,\nit's a very subtle small movement.\n\n177\n00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:49.770\nYou want to select this line and\nthen subtly drag it into the inside.\n\n178\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.688\nSo I'm just going to very small movement\ndrag that to the inside of my circle.\n\n179\n00:08:53.688 --> 00:08:56.572\nAnd you'll see that it will now flip\nthe text into the inside of my circle.\n\n180\n00:08:56.572 --> 00:08:59.874\nSo if I move it down or around, now you'll\nsee we'll have the opposite problem.\n\n181\n00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:02.625\nIf I move it up,\nit's gonna be upside-down,\n\n182\n00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:06.370\nbut basically, it will just\ncontinue to flip it as you need it.\n\n183\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.450\nNow this one tends to get a little hidden.\n\n184\n00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:13.935\nYou notice that I moved my text around,\nearlier before I started this.\n\n185\n00:09:13.935 --> 00:09:14.860\nAnd part of the reason why is\n\n186\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.625\ncuz sometimes it kind of lands\nin the middle of your text.\n\n187\n00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:20.385\nUnlike the two with the white boxes\ncuz those will kind of always\n\n188\n00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:22.615\nbe on the right or\nleft hand sides of your text.\n\n189\n00:09:22.615 --> 00:09:25.885\nSo that is the only other thing to point\nout is that sometimes that will get\n\n190\n00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:27.795\na little bit hidden for you.\n\n191\n00:09:27.795 --> 00:09:29.776\nI think you can also do\nthis under type menu.\n\n192\n00:09:29.776 --> 00:09:34.975\nYou go to Type &gt;Type on a Path\n&gt; Type on a Path Options.\n\n193\n00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:39.442\nWe can go ahead and look at that and\nthen that Flip is an option there for you.\n\n194\n00:09:39.442 --> 00:09:41.456\nSo for some reason,\nI'll turn on my preview so you can see it.\n\n195\n00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:45.255\nFor some reason that isn't working for\nyou or you're losing that line,\n\n196\n00:09:45.255 --> 00:09:46.570\nyou can also go that way.\n\n197\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.350\nAnd again, that was just Type &gt; Type\non a Path &gt; Type on a Path Options.\n\n198\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.930\nNow with that you probably noticed some of\nthe other effects that you can apply to\n\n199\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:10:01.540\nthis, Rainbow skew, 3D ribbon,\nall kinds of crazy things.\n\n200\n00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.540\nI tend to just leave mine alone,\nbut you can do what you want.\n\n201\n00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.350\n&gt;&gt; And\nI've actually had some examples where,\n\n202\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.945\nif you do this, cuz this is any path,\nlike you just said.\n\n203\n00:10:08.945 --> 00:10:13.620\nYou chose a circle, if you had drawn\na straight line, like you used the line\n\n204\n00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.370\ntool, draw a diagonal line, well, the text\nis going to sit like perpendicular,\n\n205\n00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.440\nkind of like this to the text, right?\n\n206\n00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.320\nWell then,\nwhen you start doing rainbows and skews,\n\n207\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.237\nthen it's gonna change the orientation\nof the text sitting on the path.\n\n208\n00:10:28.237 --> 00:10:33.171\nAnd that makes it a little bit more of\na significant difference when you're\n\n209\n00:10:33.171 --> 00:10:34.905\nkinda demonstrate that.\n\n210\n00:10:34.905 --> 00:10:35.895\nLike right there.\n\n211\n00:10:35.895 --> 00:10:36.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n212\n00:10:36.915 --> 00:10:37.505\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to do as you are talking.\n\n213\n00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:39.826\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you'll see I had that same error\n\n214\n00:10:39.826 --> 00:10:42.255\nmessage cuz I click in the wrong spot.\n\n215\n00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:45.566\nI just developed [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now if you go into the Type on\n\n216\n00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:50.830\na Path and do some of like\nthe Stairstepping and the 3D ribbon.\n\n217\n00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.750\nRight there, like that's the biggest one,\nthe stair step because I don't want it\n\n218\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.400\norientated to the path,\nI want it to stay on the path but\n\n219\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.840\nthen stay straight up if\nyou know what I'm saying.\n\n220\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and\nI that's a great example and\n\n221\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.130\nit also shows that you're not\njust stuck with a circle on this.\n\n222\n00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.900\nIt could be something as\nsimple as a diagonal line\n\n223\n00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.510\nthat you can use to Type\non a Path tool for.\n\n224\n00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can use the brush tool,\nthe pen tool, no,\n\n225\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.620\nwe haven't done the pen tool yet, right?\n\n226\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.223\nUse the pencil.\n\n227\n00:11:13.223 --> 00:11:15.022\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, don't get so fancy.\n\n228\n00:11:15.022 --> 00:11:18.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nI love how you use the ends.\n\n229\n00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.285\nBecause I would actually always teach\nit from, I called it the shower handle.\n\n230\n00:11:21.285 --> 00:11:23.835\n[LAUGH] Especially when we were\ndoing the circle cuz it's like,\n\n231\n00:11:23.835 --> 00:11:26.767\nyou know the shower handle goes like\nthis and you move the handle around,\n\n232\n00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:27.939\nit kind of pushed it around.\n\n233\n00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:30.224\nCuz you can move it back and forth, but\n\n234\n00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:34.380\nit is a lot easier to control where\nthe text sits by using those boxes.\n\n235\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.494\nLike I said, don't click\nthe box align with the box, and\n\n236\n00:11:38.494 --> 00:11:43.250\nthen just use that little pusher\nguy to push in or pull it out.\n\n237\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.422\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n&gt;&gt; I like the way you did that.\n\n238\n00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:45.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you.\n\n239\n00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.796\nI personally like the shower handle\nexample better than the line with the box,\n\n240\n00:11:48.796 --> 00:11:50.330\nbecause that's what I just called it.\n\n241\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.274\nYour's sounds so much cuter.\n\n242\n00:11:52.274 --> 00:11:53.550\n[LAUGH].\n\n243\n00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.310\nBut yeah, exactly what she was saying.\n\n244\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:56.442\nSo I'll go ahead and\n\n245\n00:11:56.442 --> 00:12:00.710\njust for example to show you what this\nlooks like if I go back to my brush tool.\n\n246\n00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.190\nSo you can kinda see, okay,\n\n247\n00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:06.650\nI'm a big fan of the swirly lines with the\nbrush tool, I can go ahead and do this.\n\n248\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.660\nYou'll see, okay great,\n\n249\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.510\nI cover it over to the point where I get\nthat path that lets me know and I can say\n\n250\n00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.230\nmaybe something more creative than hello,\nmy name is Emily, but that's all I got.\n\n251\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.555\nSo, Howdy.\n\n252\n00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:22.209\n[LAUGH] That's all I have,\nbut you can see, okay,\n\n253\n00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:25.084\nthis is exactly how this is gonna work.\n\n254\n00:12:25.084 --> 00:12:27.870\nAnd I can kinda rotate that\naround as you need to.\n\n255\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.890\nSo definitely one I'm a fan of.\n\n256\n00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and also, if you're kind of\npicking this out, it's like, wait,\n\n257\n00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.400\nbut we had a black stroke first.\n\n258\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.870\nAnd then as soon as you attach text to it,\nthe stroke appearance,\n\n259\n00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.610\nI wanna say, goes away by default.\n\n260\n00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.720\nSo, and for right now, just stay with it.\n\n261\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.570\nLike, okay, that's fine.\n\n262\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.602\nIf you wanted to have it, actually have\nanother line one thing that I would always\n\n263\n00:12:51.602 --> 00:12:54.232\nteach is just like,\njust duplicate the path first.\n\n264\n00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:58.541\nGo ahead and get the Type on a Path and\nthen just like align it up or kind of,\n\n265\n00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:01.760\nlet it sit back on where\nyou want to have it be.\n\n266\n00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.680\nThat right now is probably the easiest way\nto keep a line and keep the text on it.\n\n267\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.080\nThere's other ways right now, but we're\nkinda keeping in the context don't go too\n\n268\n00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.350\nfar out of a scope of this program and\nthat's how I would go ahead and do it.\n\n269\n00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.940\nIn case you're wondering.\n\n270\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.860\n&gt;&gt; We always want to know what you're.\n\n271\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.797\nNo actually, that's a great point and\nsomething that I meant to mention is that\n\n272\n00:13:24.797 --> 00:13:28.350\nyou will notice that by default all\nthe formatting that you had is gone.\n\n273\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.510\nSo if you take the time to really\ncarefully select your strokes and\n\n274\n00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.560\nmake something really cool just\nknow that is gonna disappear.\n\n275\n00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.372\nBut to Vonne's point, if I kind of go\nback here, if I were to duplicate this,\n\n276\n00:13:39.372 --> 00:13:44.331\nthen Type on a Path, I didn't click on\nthe right spot, and when I Type on a Path,\n\n277\n00:13:44.331 --> 00:13:46.270\nthere we go, I say Howdy.\n\n278\n00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.950\nI can kind of just pretend,\n\n279\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.320\nokay, that kinda looks like\nit was on that line, right?\n\n280\n00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.200\nSo you can kinda do it that way.\n\n281\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and of course there's multiple\ntechniques and everything, but right now,\n\n282\n00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.240\nI figured I'd throw that out to you.\n\n283\n00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.700\nAnd we can always do some other things\n\n284\n00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.330\nin another show that tells you how\nto do some other fancier stuff.\n\n285\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.900\nBut it does take some other techniques\nthat if we're watching in this order we\n\n286\n00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.260\nhaven't gotten there yet.\n\n287\n00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.855\nSo I'm gonna stop talking.\n\n288\n00:14:11.855 --> 00:14:14.368\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, just know.\n\n289\n00:14:14.368 --> 00:14:18.362\nSo that's our kind of short for\nnow fake technique of doing it.\n\n290\n00:14:18.362 --> 00:14:22.392\nBut we'll go ahead and move on from the\nType on the Path tool into our Touch Type\n\n291\n00:14:22.392 --> 00:14:24.130\ntool, which is also pretty fun.\n\n292\n00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:24.900\nSo we'll go ahead and\n\n293\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:30.070\ndelete my Howdy, as cute as that is,\nand kinda get rid of that.\n\n294\n00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.544\nAnd we're gonna move\ninto our Touch Type tool.\n\n295\n00:14:32.544 --> 00:14:36.130\nOur Touch Type tool is really kinda fun.\n\n296\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.650\nIt's funny because what we're\ngonna be talking about next,\n\n297\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.760\noutlined text, the Touch Type tool\nwhen it came out a few years ago\n\n298\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.300\nkind of took away some of the need for\noutline text a little bit.\n\n299\n00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.170\nBecause what it will allow you to do is\nkind of edit characters individually, and\n\n300\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.610\nso you'll see what I mean here.\n\n301\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.910\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust type out some type normally.\n\n302\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.670\nAnd type out Vonne.\n\n303\n00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.147\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just really creative with the names\n\n304\n00:15:01.147 --> 00:15:02.610\nand the hi variation here.\n\n305\n00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.580\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\ntype out Vonne.\n\n306\n00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.110\nMaybe I'll make that a little bigger.\n\n307\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:12.970\nI can go ahead and give this my kind\nof default funny font is always Cubano.\n\n308\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.187\nI don't know why, but\nthat's just always what I pick, so\n\n309\n00:15:15.187 --> 00:15:16.466\nthat's what we're going with.\n\n310\n00:15:16.466 --> 00:15:20.342\nAnd then from here once you\nhave your type generally set,\n\n311\n00:15:20.342 --> 00:15:25.050\nyou have some sort of an idea,\ngo ahead and grab your Touch Type tool.\n\n312\n00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:29.760\nNow as the name implies with\nthe Touch Type tool, if you have a touch\n\n313\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.195\nscreen enabled device, this is where\nthat's gonna start to get really cool.\n\n314\n00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:36.775\nNow I say that, I don't have\na touchscreen enabled device, so\n\n315\n00:15:36.775 --> 00:15:40.665\nyou can't see all of that right here but\nyou can imagine what that would look like.\n\n316\n00:15:40.665 --> 00:15:43.355\nSo basically,\nrather than selecting these with my mouse,\n\n317\n00:15:43.355 --> 00:15:46.455\nyou can kind of just select it with your\nhand, kind of do that pinch to zoom,\n\n318\n00:15:46.455 --> 00:15:49.075\nwhatever it works on your specific device.\n\n319\n00:15:49.075 --> 00:15:53.062\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just select\na letter, so I'll start with the V.\n\n320\n00:15:53.062 --> 00:15:54.938\nAnd then what we'll see here,\n\n321\n00:15:54.938 --> 00:15:59.642\nis that we can do all kinds of crazy\nthings with this, to edit each character.\n\n322\n00:15:59.642 --> 00:16:02.907\nAnd the really awesome thing about it,\nwhich is why it's so\n\n323\n00:16:02.907 --> 00:16:06.902\ndifferent from outline text,\nis this is going to stay as editable text.\n\n324\n00:16:06.902 --> 00:16:09.814\nThe other options that you had to\ndo in kind of older versions of\n\n325\n00:16:09.814 --> 00:16:12.670\nIllustrator Is that you had to\nconvert your text to a shape and\n\n326\n00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.358\nthen be able to do all these things.\n\n327\n00:16:14.358 --> 00:16:17.220\nSo the fact that it's\nstill editable is awesome.\n\n328\n00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.340\nSo, now we can go here, and\n\n329\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.760\nit's kind of just like using almost\nlike using that free transform tool, or\n\n330\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.840\nkinda just like using the bounding box to\ntransform an object, something like that.\n\n331\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.510\nYou can kind of go up and down.\n\n332\n00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.350\nI always like to hold down\nmy shift key just to make\n\n333\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.170\nsure I'm sizing proportionally,\nbut you don't have to, and\n\n334\n00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.990\nI think Illustrator even kind of\ndoes that a little bit for you.\n\n335\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.410\nYou can use this top circle here to\nkind of rotate like if I wanted to\n\n336\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.400\nflip that V around.\n\n337\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.970\nAnd then, what you also notice is that, so\n\n338\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.900\nall your type typically sits on something\nthat's known as a base line, right?\n\n339\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.010\nThat's kind of where all the type meets.\n\n340\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.690\nAnd then, if you think if you\nhave like a lowercase of Y or\n\n341\n00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.290\nsomething like that it\ntends to go below it.\n\n342\n00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.790\nBut it all has that line that it sits on,\nright?\n\n343\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.750\nWith your touch type tool,\nyou can kinda go below the baseline.\n\n344\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.490\nSo you see, as I'm doing that,\nit says Baseline Shift.\n\n345\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.400\nIt's letting me know, okay,\nI can kinda move that over.\n\n346\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.410\nAnd then now, I can move all\nof the rest of this text over.\n\n347\n00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.120\nI can make that a little bit larger,\nmaybe wanna move that up.\n\n348\n00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.935\nAnd I can kind of go through here and\njust edit each shape individually.\n\n349\n00:17:15.935 --> 00:17:18.250\nS0, Vonne,\nI'm making your name look pretty cool.\n\n350\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.438\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nI feel so fancy over here.\n\n351\n00:17:20.438 --> 00:17:23.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sitting there like, yay!\n\n352\n00:17:23.365 --> 00:17:24.210\n&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo!\n\n353\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.440\n&gt;&gt; And this tool is amazing.\n\n354\n00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.720\nLike you said, back in the day,\n\n355\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.000\nI know I've said this a couple of times\nalready in some of these episodes.\n\n356\n00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.480\nIt's like this was never\npossible is editable text.\n\n357\n00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.169\nTo be able to do all of this you'd\nhave to do each individual letter,\n\n358\n00:17:41.169 --> 00:17:45.668\ndo the baseline shift, the road bubble and\nit's just a pain, honestly.\n\n359\n00:17:45.668 --> 00:17:51.650\nSo this was one of this big jump\nwhen this tool or technique came out\n\n360\n00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:57.540\nwhere you can see it could be so\nmuch more creative with your type as type.\n\n361\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.630\nAnd I know we keep emphasizing that and\nyou're like well type is type.\n\n362\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.680\nWhat do you mean this whole thing?\n\n363\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.370\nAnd when we get into outlines\nwe'll kind of understand.\n\n364\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.640\nWell, we've already kind of alluded to it.\n\n365\n00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah.\n\n366\n00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.500\n&gt;&gt; It's not texting more it's just Paths.\n\n367\n00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.840\nIt's just shapes.\n\n368\n00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, which is a little different.\n\n369\n00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n370\n00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.390\nBut that's the beauty\nof the touch type tool.\n\n371\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.540\nSo, that's kinda what makes it fun.\n\n372\n00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.120\nAnd, then you're touch type tool,\nof course, as I've said,\n\n373\n00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.290\nif you have a touch screen enabled device,\nthis is where you really want to\n\n374\n00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.890\nbust that out and kinda seize some\nof the cool features with that.\n\n375\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.730\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou can change each one of these letters.\n\n376\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.451\nLike the colors, right?\n\n377\n00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:28.190\nI mean-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n378\n00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:32.110\n&gt;&gt; You go on to the fill right there,\nand I change it to, yeah, yellow and\n\n379\n00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.035\nwhat have you.\n\n380\n00:18:33.035 --> 00:18:38.720\nAnd so it's, and that's another\nkind of feature, it's treating\n\n381\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.270\neverything as an individual object,\nand you grab the pink, which is good.\n\n382\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.145\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Naturally,\n\n383\n00:18:45.145 --> 00:18:46.990\nI'm making Vonne's name a rainbow.\n\n384\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah.\n\n385\n00:18:48.308 --> 00:18:51.795\nSo you can do all kinds\nof editable things.\n\n386\n00:18:51.795 --> 00:18:55.295\nNow, we've talked about outline text, so\nI feel like it's important to go ahead,\n\n387\n00:18:55.295 --> 00:18:56.475\nand show you what we mean with that.\n\n388\n00:18:56.475 --> 00:18:59.790\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead, and\nI'm gonna type maybe, just for\n\n389\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.400\nexample, say, I'll type Emily.\n\n390\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.580\nSo we'll get kind of our opposites here.\n\n391\n00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.270\nNow, as we've said, the difference\nbetween the Touch Type tool and\n\n392\n00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.140\noutlining your text, well,\nthere are a couple of differences.\n\n393\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.510\nBut one is that outlining your text,\n\n394\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.790\nthe reason that you would do it is because\nit will convert your text to a shape.\n\n395\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.700\nThe great thing about that is,\nis it makes things like gradients easier,\n\n396\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.950\nit makes sharing your files easier,\nif somebody doesn't have your fonts.\n\n397\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.630\nBut once you do it, unless you use\nthe undo or Commander Ctrl+Z to undo,\n\n398\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.070\nyou're stuck with that.\n\n399\n00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.980\nSo the example, or\nthe thing that I always tell people to do,\n\n400\n00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.920\nis that if you are going to outline\nyour text, which is good practice,\n\n401\n00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.890\nespecially if you're sending your\nfiles to something like a printer,\n\n402\n00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.580\nand unless you send the specific font\nfiles that you're using with it,\n\n403\n00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.480\nyou need to also,\nyou need to outline your text.\n\n404\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.475\nSo that way, when they open it up in\nIllustrator they are not getting all these\n\n405\n00:19:52.475 --> 00:19:57.790\nwarning messages like, hey, use this weird\nfont, Cubano, and I don't have that.\n\n406\n00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.530\nSo that's the reason why we wanna do it.\n\n407\n00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.390\nBut because it's not\ngonna be editable later,\n\n408\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.060\nI need to save myself a version\nwhere this is editable.\n\n409\n00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.480\nSo I will either kind of\nduplicate this off to the side,\n\n410\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.730\noff of my art board before I do it.\n\n411\n00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.550\nOr what I'll do is I'll just\nsave a version of my file,\n\n412\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:19.480\ncall it file and\nthen I'll have a file dash outline.\n\n413\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.780\nSo I'll have two different versions of\nmy file just depending on what I need.\n\n414\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.820\nSo once we do this, you're stuck.\n\n415\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.110\nNow that I've warned you about that app.\n\n416\n00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.670\nSo it's very simple to do,\nto actually outline your text.\n\n417\n00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.820\nAll you're gonna do is you're going\nto take your font, or take your type,\n\n418\n00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:40.090\nrather, right-click, and\nthen you're gonna choose create outlines.\n\n419\n00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:45.930\nI thought there was a command or control,\n&gt;&gt; No, it's in the Type menu.\n\n420\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.840\n&gt;&gt; In the type menu, yeah, I thought\nthere was a keyboard shortcut for it.\n\n421\n00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there it is.\n\n422\n00:20:49.355 --> 00:20:53.390\n&gt;&gt; Shift+Ctrl+O is the keyboard shortcut,\nor you can go to your Type menu as well.\n\n423\n00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.820\nSo right-click, Create Outlines.\n\n424\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.290\nAnd then now,\nwhat you're gonna see, okay, so\n\n425\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.250\nthey're grouped, so\nyou don't see a lot of difference.\n\n426\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.710\nBut if I kinda double-click, go into\nisolation mode, you're gonna start to see\n\n427\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:09.120\nall those points, and you're gonna be able\nto when we get into our layer tool and\n\n428\n00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.100\npen tool and all that you're gonna\nbe able to really edit this more.\n\n429\n00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is now a shape.\n\n430\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.077\nThis is a group of shapes\nthat come together.\n\n431\n00:21:18.077 --> 00:21:22.986\nAnd that's where it's, and I've actually\nhad where I'm sending something\n\n432\n00:21:22.986 --> 00:21:27.593\nto the printers, like the print\nspecifications, they'll say, okay,\n\n433\n00:21:27.593 --> 00:21:32.300\nI need it, CMYK, 300 ppi, and\nall text must be converted to outlines.\n\n434\n00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.060\nEven if it's paragraph text,\nmaybe paragraphs of information,\n\n435\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.830\nyou still convert that to outlines\nbecause that commercial printer\n\n436\n00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:44.720\ndoesn't wanna have to do\nanything with your font files.\n\n437\n00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.640\nAnd especially with a little\nbit more in back in the day,\n\n438\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.910\nlike the Mac versus PC fonts.\n\n439\n00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:53.840\nAnd there's so many fonts out there,\nthey're like just give it to us in like\n\n440\n00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.160\nthe straight vector information, and we'll\nbe good to go, we won't have to worry\n\n441\n00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.660\nabout that whole kind of extra\nlayer of issues that can arise.\n\n442\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n443\n00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.730\nSo I was trying to show, while you were\ntalking, I was trying to show the example\n\n444\n00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.690\nof a paragraph, just to try to kind\nof reiterate what you had said.\n\n445\n00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.540\nYes, if you are working on a flyer or\nsomething in Illustrator,\n\n446\n00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.680\nyou definitely wanna do same thing.\n\n447\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.930\nI'm gonna duplicate this over,\nor save it somewhere else.\n\n448\n00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.390\nSo that you have it if your client or\n\n449\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.706\nyour boss needs to you edit something\nreal quick, you're not in trouble later.\n\n450\n00:22:21.706 --> 00:22:23.625\nAnd then right-click and Create Outlines.\n\n451\n00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:26.795\nAnd I definitely have\nthe same issue before we're,\n\n452\n00:22:26.795 --> 00:22:28.885\neven on accident I just forgot to\noutline something one time, and\n\n453\n00:22:28.885 --> 00:22:31.395\nthe printer came back to me like we can't\ndo this, you didn't outline your text.\n\n454\n00:22:31.395 --> 00:22:35.663\nSo I have to go back and redo, or\nnot redo it, but outline text.\n\n455\n00:22:35.663 --> 00:22:40.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one thing that I have done,\nI usually save either multiple files or\n\n456\n00:22:40.195 --> 00:22:41.875\nsometimes I'll put like\na totally different layer and\n\n457\n00:22:41.875 --> 00:22:45.375\nthen hide the layer of it as text,\ntext, text.\n\n458\n00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:47.730\nBut then sometimes I'll go back and\n\n459\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.740\nI forgot what font I used\nin the outlined version.\n\n460\n00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.990\nSo I've gotten in a habit\nof anytime I do it,\n\n461\n00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.810\ntype the name of the font off to the side,\neven if I create,\n\n462\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.260\ncuz sometimes I do a ctrl+a, Select All,\nand everything goes to an outline.\n\n463\n00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.730\nBut since I wrote down the name\nof the font that I used,\n\n464\n00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.120\nthat's off to the side, even if it's\noutlined, I know which one it was.\n\n465\n00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.900\nAnd that's where I, it was tripping me up\nquite a few times, and now it's my new\n\n466\n00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.460\nhabit of anything I do, write the name of\nthe font that you used off to the side.\n\n467\n00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:24.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is a smart and handy tip\ncuz I've also had the moment before,\n\n468\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.523\nwhere it's like, well,\nthis kind of looks like Open Sans, but\n\n469\n00:23:26.523 --> 00:23:27.230\n[LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n470\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.080\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n471\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.600\nSo, yeah, you always want to save\nthat duplicate, write yourself notes.\n\n472\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.040\nI think layers are a great example.\n\n473\n00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.690\nAnd that's a great time to use layers.\n\n474\n00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.410\nAs we mentioned, I'm not always\nthe best about using layers.\n\n475\n00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:41.580\nI could be a little more organized.\n\n476\n00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.950\nBut if you are,\nthat's a great time to be organized.\n\n477\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:49.480\nOne other thing that I wanted to\nmention with our text outlines.\n\n478\n00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.930\nBecause it often comes up, especially\nas we're talking about gradients.\n\n479\n00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.950\nHey, can I apply a gradient on my type?\n\n480\n00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.240\nIn other programs, yes, you can.\n\n481\n00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.655\nBut you'll see, if I go ahead here,\nthis was my non-outlined version.\n\n482\n00:24:01.655 --> 00:24:04.321\nIf I go to my swatches panel and\ntry to apply a gradient there,\n\n483\n00:24:04.321 --> 00:24:05.587\nnothing is going to happen.\n\n484\n00:24:05.587 --> 00:24:07.080\nWith you do that,\n\n485\n00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:13.167\nyou have to convert your type To a shape\nin order to apply a gradient on it.\n\n486\n00:24:13.167 --> 00:24:16.712\nSo I can go ahead there and\nI can now apply a gradient to that.\n\n487\n00:24:16.712 --> 00:24:18.152\nSo that's the key thing.\n\n488\n00:24:18.152 --> 00:24:21.776\nYou always have to do that outline mode or\ncreate a shape out of it.\n\n489\n00:24:21.776 --> 00:24:25.221\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and now, that it's a group you\ncan see that the gradient was applied to\n\n490\n00:24:25.221 --> 00:24:26.769\nevery single individual letter.\n\n491\n00:24:26.769 --> 00:24:30.995\nIf you take the gradient tool now as it's\nstill a group and just click, hold, and\n\n492\n00:24:30.995 --> 00:24:31.750\ndrag across.\n\n493\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:36.716\nNow, you can go ahead and have a gradient\ngo all the way through the word and\n\n494\n00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:37.368\nit goes.\n\n495\n00:24:37.368 --> 00:24:39.609\nI always got that big question.\n\n496\n00:24:39.609 --> 00:24:42.151\nI was like,\nI can't do gradients with text.\n\n497\n00:24:42.151 --> 00:24:45.193\nWell, you can, it's just not text anymore.\n\n498\n00:24:45.193 --> 00:24:45.890\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n499\n00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.862\n&gt;&gt; So, make sure you're done with\ntyping and that's what you need.\n\n500\n00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:49.988\nAnd always have a backup.\n\n501\n00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:52.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n502\n00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:55.445\nBut yes, you can still get\nthe same kind of appearance.\n\n503\n00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:56.991\nAnd just for example's sake,\n\n504\n00:24:56.991 --> 00:25:00.148\nbecause we did talk a lot about\nthe Touch Type tool versus this.\n\n505\n00:25:00.148 --> 00:25:04.436\nSo, in the past, before the Touch Type\ntool existed, what you would have to do,\n\n506\n00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:07.022\nis you would either have\nto kind of ungroup this or\n\n507\n00:25:07.022 --> 00:25:11.212\njust double-click to go in isolation mode,\nwhich is what I'm gonna do here.\n\n508\n00:25:11.212 --> 00:25:12.837\nI did a Cmd or Ctrl+Z.\n\n509\n00:25:12.837 --> 00:25:19.335\nAnd then I would have to kind of shift\nthings around, okay, I'm gonna rotate.\n\n510\n00:25:19.335 --> 00:25:22.167\nTry and adjust it that way.\n\n511\n00:25:22.167 --> 00:25:26.729\nYou would have to adjust it as\na shape rather than as a character.\n\n512\n00:25:26.729 --> 00:25:29.116\nAnd again,\nyou later can't go back and edit it.\n\n513\n00:25:29.116 --> 00:25:32.842\nSo that's when we say the Touch Type tool\nis nice because you used to have to do it\n\n514\n00:25:32.842 --> 00:25:33.354\nthis way.\n\n515\n00:25:33.354 --> 00:25:36.394\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because at this point, if you\nhad misspelled my name by any means,\n\n516\n00:25:36.394 --> 00:25:38.170\nthat is the correct spelling, by the way.\n\n517\n00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.115\nYou could go in and\ntake out an N or take out the E or\n\n518\n00:25:41.115 --> 00:25:43.940\njust V-O-N, which everybody wants to do.\n\n519\n00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.635\nIt's like, no, it's V-O-N-N-E.\n\n520\n00:25:45.635 --> 00:25:46.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n521\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's text this.\n\n522\n00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:50.060\nAnd then you could go double N's and\nall that kind of,\n\n523\n00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.951\nI guess I already have\na double N in my name.\n\n524\n00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:52.636\nThere you go.\n\n525\n00:25:52.636 --> 00:25:54.552\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] VONNNNE.\n\n526\n00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:57.671\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you can go back and do that\n\n527\n00:25:57.671 --> 00:26:02.168\nediting as text, which again, I hope\nthat's driving home the point of why we\n\n528\n00:26:02.168 --> 00:26:06.826\nkeep saying that and why it's so cool to\nbe able to have it as the Touch Type tool.\n\n529\n00:26:06.826 --> 00:26:09.112\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I also made one other observation.\n\n530\n00:26:09.112 --> 00:26:09.693\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n531\n00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:13.131\n&gt;&gt; That font that you just chose,\nI'm like, why does this look so familiar.\n\n532\n00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:15.813\nIt's like the little letters that\nyou put on the refrigerator.\n\n533\n00:26:15.813 --> 00:26:16.393\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n534\n00:26:16.393 --> 00:26:18.123\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It kinda reminds me of that.\n\n535\n00:26:18.123 --> 00:26:19.644\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n536\n00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:22.628\nIt's always my go to for\nsome reason in an example like this.\n\n537\n00:26:22.628 --> 00:26:23.812\nI'm like, this looks kinda fun.\n\n538\n00:26:23.812 --> 00:26:24.868\n&gt;&gt; I love it, yeah.\n\n539\n00:26:24.868 --> 00:26:27.817\nI mean, it's obviously, yes,\nthose are the refrigerator letters.\n\n540\n00:26:27.817 --> 00:26:28.815\nThey look just like it.\n\n541\n00:26:28.815 --> 00:26:30.443\nAt least to me it does, so.\n\n542\n00:26:30.443 --> 00:26:31.916\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNo, it's perfect, just perfect.\n\n543\n00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:34.223\nI got it for a client once and\nthey didn't like it, so I was like, well,\n\n544\n00:26:34.223 --> 00:26:35.120\nI'll just use it for this.\n\n545\n00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:35.781\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n546\n00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:37.013\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n547\n00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:38.257\n&gt;&gt; It goes along with our whole like\n\n548\n00:26:38.257 --> 00:26:41.265\nkindergarten of references that we've\nbeen making in some other episodes.\n\n549\n00:26:41.265 --> 00:26:44.620\nSo I'm just like, this is just\nlike kindergarten all over again.\n\n550\n00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.305\nYay.\n\n551\n00:26:45.305 --> 00:26:45.979\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n552\n00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:48.071\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yes, it was a perfect example for\n\n553\n00:26:48.071 --> 00:26:48.951\naffecting our text.\n\n554\n00:26:48.951 --> 00:26:51.089\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think we're done.\n\n555\n00:26:51.089 --> 00:26:55.663\nYeah, that was it for affecting our text\nor at least kind of getting us started.\n\n556\n00:26:55.663 --> 00:26:59.247\nI'm sure in some other episodes we'll\nmention, I can already think of like\n\n557\n00:26:59.247 --> 00:27:02.159\nan envelope distort or\nsomething that we'll talk about, and\n\n558\n00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:06.079\nagain, in a separate episode, where we can\nkinda go a little fancy on our text, but\n\n559\n00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:07.769\nthat was a great start, I think so.\n\n560\n00:27:07.769 --> 00:27:09.488\n&gt;&gt; Ooh,\ndropping the envelope at the store.\n\n561\n00:27:09.488 --> 00:27:10.486\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n\n562\n00:27:10.486 --> 00:27:11.728\n&gt;&gt; I'm dropping that bomb, yeah.\n\n563\n00:27:11.728 --> 00:27:15.249\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can't wait to get there, but\n\n564\n00:27:15.249 --> 00:27:18.868\nfor right now, I think that was a great\nintroduction to different things\n\n565\n00:27:18.868 --> 00:27:22.504\nthat can do to affect our text and\nmake it just a little cooler there, so.\n\n566\n00:27:22.504 --> 00:27:25.150\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this episode.\n\n567\n00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.296\nSigning off for CreativeProTV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n568\n00:27:28.296 --> 00:27:29.445\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n569\n00:27:29.445 --> 00:27:30.791\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you

I'm going to explain\nwhat those words mean.\n\n11\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.240\nNo, it's kind of funny cuz they\nsound like dull words I think.\n\n12\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.350\nBut the pathfinder and the compound path,\nthey do actually some pretty cool things.\n\n13\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.930\n&gt;&gt; And we were talking about this,\n\n14\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.740\nthey are kind of core concepts\nin Illustrator, and at first,\n\n15\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.290\nand I remember when I first learned this\non my whatever, whatever that thing is.\n\n16\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.420\nAnd also because I really\ndidn't understand it.\n\n17\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.190\nIt's almost too simple,\nand you're thinking,\n\n18\n00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.450\nI'm not going to see this that much.\n\n19\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.100\nIt's amazing how much I see and\nuse both the pathfinder panel and\n\n20\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.930\nthe concept of what is a compound path\nin the things that I do in Illustrator.\n\n21\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Not to scare you,\n\n22\n00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.560\nmaybe you might not get\nit at first either.\n\n23\n00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.580\nThat's okay,\n\n24\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.780\nI'm just trying to tell you my perspective\nof how I've been using illustrator.\n\n25\n00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.950\nAnd it is, you're going to see\nit come up more than you think.\n\n26\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I totally agree.\n\n27\n00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.520\nI think part of the reason for\n\n28\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.610\nthat is why it comes up is because I tend\nto think with people in Illustrator,\n\n29\n00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.580\nyou tend to automatically go to\nthe hard route for something.\n\n30\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.240\nSo, we always talk about the pen tool,\nmaybe you haven't gotten there yet\n\n31\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.170\nin the episodes, but that's kind of\nthe hard route of doing something.\n\n32\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.250\nWhat the pathfinder panel, which is kind\nof where we'll kind of start out, does for\n\n33\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.740\nyou, it basically makes it look\nlike you can draw when you can't.\n\n34\n00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.830\n[LAUGH] That's the way I phrase it.\n\n35\n00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.568\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's probably why I've loved it so much.\n\n36\n00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:00.017\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All my years as well,\n\n37\n00:02:00.017 --> 00:02:03.437\nbecause it's like, I'm like if I\njust kind of put these together and\n\n38\n00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:05.950\nI'm a little bit more of a puzzle person.\n\n39\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.508\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n40\n00:02:06.508 --> 00:02:10.740\nhow the pieces fit together and if I just\ntake that out, there you go, perfect!\n\n41\n00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.720\nThat's what I wanted to do.\n\n42\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.450\n&gt;&gt; I can see the puzzle example for sure.\n\n43\n00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.530\nOkay, we are gonna take your puzzle and\nwe are gonna start with Mickey Mouse.\n\n44\n00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.640\nI'm all about the mouse.\n\n45\n00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.970\nSo what we're gonna do here,\nI'm actually gonna give two examples.\n\n46\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.360\nI'm gonna one, just draw a Mickey Mouse,\ngo with me here, okay.\n\n47\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.246\nIf you don't love the mouse, I'm sorry,\nterrible childhood memories, I don't know.\n\n48\n00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:34.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But go ahead and just draw something,\n\n49\n00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.390\neven if it's not exactly like this,\nsomething that's just close to it.\n\n50\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.020\nI'm gonna just draw those three circles\nand then make this a little bit larger,\n\n51\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.930\njust so\nit's a little bit bigger on my art board.\n\n52\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.420\nAnd then right next to that,\nI'm gonna take two yellow circles,\n\n53\n00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.090\njust kind of overlapping each other.\n\n54\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.750\nKind of like a Venn diagram,\ndo you remember that back from?\n\n55\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.670\nEnglish?\n\n56\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.092\nWhatever it was.\n\n57\n00:02:57.092 --> 00:03:00.220\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE], I don't know what\nclass that was in elementary school\n\n58\n00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.758\nbut [LAUGH].\n\n59\n00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:03.901\n&gt;&gt; We've gone through [INAUDIBLE]\nkindergarten [INAUDIBLE],\n\n60\n00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:07.110\nnow we're starting to get into\nthose bad memories of school.\n\n61\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is complicated [LAUGH].\n\n62\n00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.761\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, something like that.\n\n63\n00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:15.690\n[LAUGH] Venn diagram is basically just\ntwo circles not entirely overlapping each\n\n64\n00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.150\nother, but just kind of having a point\nwhere they kind of overlap in the middle.\n\n65\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.460\nSo, what these two\nare going to illustrate for\n\n66\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.780\nus is really kind of getting into the\nexample of why we would use pathfinders.\n\n67\n00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.080\nAnd when I say pathfinders,\n\n68\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.980\nI'm specifically really referring\nto the pathfinder panel.\n\n69\n00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.150\nSo first thing we need to\ndo here is go ahead and\n\n70\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.600\ngrab our pathfinder panel after\nyou've got your little set up going.\n\n71\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.970\nSo, I'm gonna go into my window menu and\n\n72\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.265\nthen of course go all the way down to path\nfinder, those are alphabetized remember.\n\n73\n00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:45.235\nSo go ahead and grab that and\nthen you open up your pathfinder panel and\n\n74\n00:03:45.235 --> 00:03:45.915\nyou're like whoa!\n\n75\n00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:49.905\nI see a bunch of different little buttons\nand things in one of those on me.\n\n76\n00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:51.965\nSo we'll start with those two examples.\n\n77\n00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.445\nWe'll kind of starts small and\n\n78\n00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:56.235\nthen I'll show you a little bit more\nabout what each of those things mean.\n\n79\n00:03:56.235 --> 00:04:00.700\nSo I am gonna grab my Mickey Mouse here.\n\n80\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.920\nNow let's say for example,\n\n81\n00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.630\nthis was my actual logo, now, if it was\nmy logo, we've talked about groups.\n\n82\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.380\nI could group this and I could work with\nit, but its really going to make your life\n\n83\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.440\na lot easier, especially if you want to\ndo something like add a stroke to this.\n\n84\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.200\nSomething like that if you\ncan make this all one shape.\n\n85\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.762\nSo there are multiple\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n86\n00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:25.450\nKind of different ways to skin a cat here,\nbut if we want to again,\n\n87\n00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.675\nespecially have something a stroke,\n\n88\n00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:31.455\nwe really need to covert that all into\none shape, so how can we do that?\n\n89\n00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:33.915\nAnd how we can do that really easily?\n\n90\n00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:35.355\nIs with our pathfinder panel.\n\n91\n00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:36.923\nSo we're gonna go into our\npathfinder panel here.\n\n92\n00:04:36.923 --> 00:04:40.757\nYou're gonna see have shape modes in your\npathfinders, don't worry about that,\n\n93\n00:04:40.757 --> 00:04:42.515\nwhat that means right now.\n\n94\n00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:45.128\nGo ahead and just click on that\nfirst top left-hand option, so\n\n95\n00:04:45.128 --> 00:04:48.405\nif you've got your Mickey Mouse selected,\nyou've all the pieces selected.\n\n96\n00:04:48.405 --> 00:04:51.870\n[INAUDIBLE] Ears, don't forget the ears,\ngo ahead and click on that button.\n\n97\n00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.490\nWhen you hover over it, it'll say unite.\n\n98\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.940\nAnd you see that will unite\neverything into one shape.\n\n99\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.623\nSo now if I go ahead and add a stroke\nto that, pink is like my go-to.\n\n100\n00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:05.880\n[LAUGH] So we can go ahead and\nhave our Mickey.\n\n101\n00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.310\nAnd you see how that stroke doesn't\noverlap those ears right there?\n\n102\n00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.260\nThat was where we were\nrunning into issues before.\n\n103\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthis is like one of the for us,\n\n104\n00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.570\nthe easiest example is to show why\ngrouping would not be the desired result\n\n105\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.540\nbecause we want that strip around\nthe outside if you want to say.\n\n106\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.790\nOtherwise, three circles melt,\ngrouping is still three circles here,\n\n107\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.150\nyou want to,\nthey'll use in that school reference.\n\n108\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.700\nIsn't there something in chemistry\nwhere you change the composition?\n\n109\n00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.221\nYou add fire and\nit changes the element, or I'm-\n\n110\n00:05:37.221 --> 00:05:39.086\n&gt;&gt; You're getting too deep [LAUGH].\n\n111\n00:05:39.086 --> 00:05:39.613\n&gt;&gt; I know [LAUGH].\n\n112\n00:05:39.613 --> 00:05:42.767\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure my science teacher is like,\n\n113\n00:05:42.767 --> 00:05:44.410\nthat is, no [LAUGH].\n\n114\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.823\n&gt;&gt; What did I do to you?\n\n115\n00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:46.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n116\n00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.161\n&gt;&gt; When did I go wrong?\n\n117\n00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:48.872\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's probably why I majored in\n\n118\n00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:49.838\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n119\n00:05:49.838 --> 00:05:50.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure,\n\n120\n00:05:50.895 --> 00:05:53.785\nbut we're changing\nthe chemical composition if\n\n121\n00:05:53.785 --> 00:05:57.530\nyou will of our shape by kind of\nuniting it and putting into one.\n\n122\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.640\nSo yeah, it's kind of cool.\n\n123\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.070\nAnd so that's one, again,\n\n124\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.620\nif you can draw, you can do that\npretty much anybody can do that.\n\n125\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.270\nSo we'll go and kind of our next example,\n\n126\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.650\nwe have those two circles that little\nfake Venn diagram we're calling.\n\n127\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.180\nNow, what exactly can we do with this?\n\n128\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.550\nWell, yeah, we can unite them and\n\n129\n00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.932\nif you wanted something that\nlooked like that, you could.\n\n130\n00:06:17.932 --> 00:06:19.510\nBut another option that you have.\n\n131\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.180\nWe're just gonna go one next\nit on our pathfinder panel.\n\n132\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.430\nSo right under that shape mode,\n\n133\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.385\nit's gonna be that second option in from\nthat left and you'll see minus front.\n\n134\n00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:33.665\n.If I go ahead and\nhit minus front, I have a moon.\n\n135\n00:06:33.665 --> 00:06:35.420\n[LAUGH] So easy, so great.\n\n136\n00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.280\nYou really didn't have to do much work\nthere, to be able to draw something.\n\n137\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.350\nSo just because you don't\nfeel like you can draw,\n\n138\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.030\ndoesn't mean you can't\ndraw in Illustrator.\n\n139\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.080\n&gt;&gt; I call that the cookie cutter button.\n\n140\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.347\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n[LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:06:46.347 --> 00:06:47.720\n&gt;&gt; So that's to do one part,\n\n142\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.370\nand that I guess that we should mention\nthe stacking order of minus front,\n\n143\n00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.080\nwhatever's on top.\n\n144\n00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.320\nThat second circle, that was the one-\n&gt;&gt; And I'll do this.\n\n145\n00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you can see.\n\n146\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.840\nThat was the one that I had on top.\n\n147\n00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.420\n&gt;&gt; Yep, the stacking order of\ntaking the cookie cutter and\n\n148\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.110\npushing down into the cookie dough and\nthat's gonna Give you your final shape.\n\n149\n00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.660\nSo stacking order does make a difference.\n\n150\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n151\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.764\nSo yeah, you want to pay attention to\nthe fact that I did say minus [INAUDIBLE],\n\n152\n00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.215\nI didn't say make a moon,\nor something like that.\n\n153\n00:07:13.215 --> 00:07:13.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Make a moon.\n\n154\n00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.965\n&gt;&gt; Because Illustrator has that,\nmake a moon button.\n\n155\n00:07:18.965 --> 00:07:21.755\nSo you do want to pay attention to that,\nbecause obviously,\n\n156\n00:07:21.755 --> 00:07:25.330\nunless your just making moons all the\ntime, it is going to make a difference.\n\n157\n00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.850\nNow, my usual best information that I can\ngive to people, since sometimes this,\n\n158\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.910\nthese don't always come across as\nthe most intuitive, really I would say.\n\n159\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.100\nIllustrator has come up with some feature\nthat we'll talk about in other episodes\n\n160\n00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.150\nthat are a little more intuitive that\nkind of do a similar thing as the path\n\n161\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.560\nfinder panel.\n\n162\n00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.200\nBut for these,\nI kind of just say play around with it.\n\n163\n00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.030\nSo you can go here and be like, okay,\nwell, I can kind of see what that does,\n\n164\n00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.210\nI can kind of see what that does,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n165\n00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.686\nNow there are some differences in\nshape modes and path finders, and\n\n166\n00:07:52.686 --> 00:07:54.653\nyou can create a compound shape and\nthings like that.\n\n167\n00:07:54.653 --> 00:07:58.024\nBut something that I wanna just show you\nreal quick, and you can kinda take a look\n\n168\n00:07:58.024 --> 00:08:00.913\nat this and I think we can make this\navailable in the exercise files.\n\n169\n00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:01.876\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I think, yes?\n\n170\n00:08:01.876 --> 00:08:04.536\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is this [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] Made\n\n171\n00:08:04.536 --> 00:08:05.510\na note.\n\n172\n00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.456\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n173\n00:08:06.456 --> 00:08:08.874\nI was like,\nI probably should have asked that.\n\n174\n00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:11.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Before we get started here, so what\n\n175\n00:08:11.677 --> 00:08:15.294\nI looked at here, I basically just took\ntwo shapes, so you can see, and I made\n\n176\n00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:19.140\na color distinction there, just so you\ncan see when that does come in to play.\n\n177\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.380\nTypically, you're always going\nto default with just one color,\n\n178\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.700\nbut literally all I did here is I went\nthrough each of the different shape modes.\n\n179\n00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.820\nSo unite, divide, intersect,\nand exclude each of those.\n\n180\n00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.470\nAnd you can see what happened\nfrom my original shape,\n\n181\n00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.065\nto the unite, to the divide,\nintercept, exclude, so on and so\n\n182\n00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:40.375\nforth, or I believe that one was\nminus front, I called it divide here,\n\n183\n00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:42.945\nI think that was maybe in\nan older version of Illustrator.\n\n184\n00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:45.535\nSame thing, though,\ngoing across the board.\n\n185\n00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:47.525\nLikewise, the result with the pathfinders.\n\n186\n00:08:47.525 --> 00:08:50.455\nYou're gonna notice that\nthe pathfinders are a little\n\n187\n00:08:50.455 --> 00:08:52.445\nbit different than our shape modes.\n\n188\n00:08:52.445 --> 00:08:56.835\nAnd part of where that come in, okay,\nso I took the same original here, and\n\n189\n00:08:56.835 --> 00:09:00.040\nthen the result In my pathfinders here.\n\n190\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.800\nI should say.\n\n191\n00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.890\nI called this original here.\n\n192\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.380\nI should say that that's result.\n\n193\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:04.970\nExcuse me.\n\n194\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.720\nMy result doesn't look all that different.\n\n195\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.760\nAnd so you're probably thinking,\nokay, what exactly did that do here?\n\n196\n00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.570\nBut here's the thing.\n\n197\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.810\nIt's almost like it kinda knocked to\nthe holdout, or knocked parts out,\n\n198\n00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.050\nkind of like that cookie cutter\nexample Vonne was mentioning, and\n\n199\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.750\nthen it's just kind of\ngrouped in there for me.\n\n200\n00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.440\nSo I can kinda double-click,\nand you can see, whoa!\n\n201\n00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.704\nThat's still kind of editable.\n\n202\n00:09:27.704 --> 00:09:33.320\nI have all the pieces left, and\nyou can kinda see how that starts to work.\n\n203\n00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.670\n&gt;&gt; I always say, if you have your\noverlapping shapes, anywhere where there's\n\n204\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:44.100\nshapes that come out of those\noverlappings, it creates that as a shape.\n\n205\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.240\nSo it's dividing where\nall the paths are and\n\n206\n00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.205\nmaking individual closed paths like that.\n\n207\n00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:55.555\nSo, that's what I always think about\nwhen we do the divide in the pathfinder.\n\n208\n00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:56.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n209\n00:09:56.335 --> 00:09:59.995\nIt's just, again,\nI think a little bit of trial and error.\n\n210\n00:09:59.995 --> 00:10:04.040\nYou can kinda see again, the result of the\ndivide and the trim looked pretty similar,\n\n211\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.670\nbut then, hey, I could pull out this\nlittle guy, which was not an option for\n\n212\n00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.260\nme with the trim.\n\n213\n00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.080\nAnd likewise with the merge, there's\nsome very small kinda subtle differences\n\n214\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.630\nthat depending on the example\nthat you use, of course,\n\n215\n00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.780\nyou'll start to see those\ndifferences a little bit more.\n\n216\n00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.946\nAnd you can see the crop outline\nminus back so and so forth.\n\n217\n00:10:20.946 --> 00:10:25.003\n&gt;&gt; And I think the biggest one is you\ncan see, I like this example right here,\n\n218\n00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:28.079\nbecause the trim and merge,\nlike we like up on the top and\n\n219\n00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:30.917\nthe path finder you have divide or\nthe minus front.\n\n220\n00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:31.560\n&gt;&gt; Minus front.\n\n221\n00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.860\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, in that sense,\n\n222\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.400\nthe minus front got rid of the circle.\n\n223\n00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.510\nLike the moon that we just did,\nit took it away and the trim,\n\n224\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.473\nyou can see the result of like\nthe moon and that square thing.\n\n225\n00:10:44.473 --> 00:10:45.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n226\n00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.570\n&gt;&gt; But the circle is still there\n&gt;&gt; It kind of keeps everything.\n\n227\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.440\nIt doesn't remove anything, that's how-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n228\n00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.800\n&gt;&gt; I sometimes try to put it in context.\n\n229\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.870\nAnd like you said, just keep clicking on\nthe buttons until you get what you want.\n\n230\n00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.720\nHave a basic understanding of it and\n\n231\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.180\nthen, because I don't, I probably use\non the bottom of the path finders,\n\n232\n00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.980\nI probably use the divide\nmore than any of the others.\n\n233\n00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very rarely.\n\n234\n00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.070\nOn occasion, the minus back,\n\n235\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.820\nwhich as you can imagine kinda does\nthe opposite of the minus front.\n\n236\n00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.660\nI'll use that one, but I agree with Vonne,\nI typically stick to more of\n\n237\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.020\nthat top row or maybe that divide or\nsomething like that.\n\n238\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.370\nBut again, just kinda keep playing around\nwith it until you see what it looks like.\n\n239\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.020\nBut just to kinda show you\nguys some more examples here.\n\n240\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.240\nSo we have our shape modes,\nour shape modes are typically fused.\n\n241\n00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.580\nSo everything is kinda fused together.\n\n242\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.430\nWhereas our pathfinders you saw okay,\nI did this divide.\n\n243\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.490\nNow I still get a little bit of\nall that separation that I can\n\n244\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.130\nkinda go ahead and alter.\n\n245\n00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.220\nBut one thing that is true of\nreally all of these is that\n\n246\n00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.530\nonce I do it it's kind of stuck that way.\n\n247\n00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:57.410\nSo I do my unite or maybe I'll\ndo minus front for this example.\n\n248\n00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.300\nAnd I am left with this.\n\n249\n00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.750\nThere is no option to be like, okay,\nnever mind, undo that, forget that.\n\n250\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.840\nUnless I do and undo or Command or\nControl Z, that is what I'm left with,\n\n251\n00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.550\nwhich is fine most of the time.\n\n252\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.860\nBut if for some reason you did\nneed that and you need to go back,\n\n253\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.630\nit's not an option that you're gonna\nhave with the pathfinder panel.\n\n254\n00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.810\nSo that is something to pay attention to.\n\n255\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.510\nAlso you may have notice\nwith your shape modes.\n\n256\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.580\nIf you do kind of you're hover to\ndiscover, you're gonna see you have that\n\n257\n00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.440\noption click to create a compound shape,\nand so what you're gonna do with that,\n\n258\n00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.470\nif I do the alt or option click, why\ndon't I go ahead and do the minus front.\n\n259\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.110\nSo I'm just holding down my alt or\noption key, clicking on that minus front.\n\n260\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.535\nIt almost is kinda like a more\neditable version of the same thing.\n\n261\n00:12:41.535 --> 00:12:43.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what you're seeing here,\n\n262\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.550\nit kinda looks like I have\na white circle on top.\n\n263\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.810\nNot really, though.\n\n264\n00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.110\nSo it kind of can go here.\n\n265\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.950\nI can double-click, and\nI can move that around.\n\n266\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.528\nMaybe I want that to be\nmore like a solar eclipse.\n\n267\n00:12:53.528 --> 00:12:54.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n268\n00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.050\nWhatever you want it to look like.\n\n269\n00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.840\nYou can go ahead and\ndo something like that.\n\n270\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.150\nAnd just double-click to get\nout of that isolation mode.\n\n271\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.910\nSo double-click into isolation mode,\ndouble-click out of isolation mode,\n\n272\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.070\nsomewhere else.\n\n273\n00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.180\nAnd you can see that that\nall still is editable.\n\n274\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.635\nAnd again, it kind of looks like you've a\nwhite circle there, but You really don't.\n\n275\n00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:13.470\nSo that's gonna be your option if you,\n\n276\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.170\nthe difference if you alt or option click\non any of the shape modes in the top row.\n\n277\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.350\nSo that's something that you\nmay wanna pay attention to.\n\n278\n00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.480\nAnd I believe that they also go ahead and\nhit the expand button.\n\n279\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.940\nExpand compound shape, it's gonna go\nahead and take away that option for you.\n\n280\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.760\nSo expanding is something that we will\nexpand upon, in other episodes, but\n\n281\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.430\nthat's just one of the features\nthat you have here.\n\n282\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.555\nSo, for some reason you'll be like, nope,\nI'm committed to this, I can go ahead and\n\n283\n00:13:36.555 --> 00:13:39.015\nhit expand and I go ahead and\ntake that option away.\n\n284\n00:13:39.015 --> 00:13:43.925\nSo I think that was it for\npathfinders, and we can go ahead and\n\n285\n00:13:43.925 --> 00:13:45.355\nmove into compound paths.\n\n286\n00:13:45.355 --> 00:13:48.625\nWe mentioned these\nare kind of similar here.\n\n287\n00:13:48.625 --> 00:13:49.995\nSo what I'm gonna do,\n\n288\n00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:54.065\nI'm gonna take two circles, just gonna\nput them right on top of each other.\n\n289\n00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.070\nWe'll do something like that, you know.\n\n290\n00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.680\nDoesn't have to be perfect,\nI'll do it like that.\n\n291\n00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.335\nWe'll do it off center, sure.\n\n292\n00:14:02.335 --> 00:14:03.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm going to do with my\n\n293\n00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.800\ncompound path, my compound path, again,\nis kind of similar, but what it's going to\n\n294\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.490\ndo, is it's going to basically\npunch the holes through something.\n\n295\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.662\nThat is a term that I stole from Vonne,\n\n296\n00:14:12.662 --> 00:14:14.610\nis that it punches the holes\nthrough something.\n\n297\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.080\nSo what we're going to see here,\nis it's going to kind of\n\n298\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.090\npunch the holes where I have\nthat other little blue circle.\n\n299\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:24.310\nSo if i right-click on this, I have both\nshapes selected, that is key to note,\n\n300\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.590\nI don't just have one selected,\nI have both shapes selected.\n\n301\n00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.488\nI'll even change the color of this so\n\n302\n00:14:28.488 --> 00:14:32.950\nmaybe you can see it a little bit better,\nsee my path outlines.\n\n303\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:38.930\nRight-click and then I am going to\nchoose make compound path, and, bam.\n\n304\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.370\nIt's gonna knock that hole out for me.\n\n305\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.660\nSo, you have some other different options.\n\n306\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.140\nI could make that Venn diagram literally,\nif I wanted to.\n\n307\n00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.970\nI could do something like this,\nselect both of those shapes,\n\n308\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.690\nright click, meet compound path.\n\n309\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.220\nKey, key difference with this.\n\n310\n00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.370\nI can now, say I was doing this later and\nI was way later in my file.\n\n311\n00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.100\nI can right click, release compound path.\n\n312\n00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.485\nI always have that option to kind of\nundo it without having to Command or\n\n313\n00:15:07.485 --> 00:15:11.440\nCtrl+Z or actually use an undo,\nunlike my pathfinder panel.\n\n314\n00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.800\nSo that's a pretty significant difference\nbetween that and the compound path.\n\n315\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nwhen you were doing the Al+Click.\n\n316\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.320\nWhere you said, compound shape, a shape is\na path, so it really is a compound path,\n\n317\n00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.930\nand that's where we were kind\nof leading right into this\n\n318\n00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.950\nconcept of when we were like, you had\nthe editability of making the moon more\n\n319\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.270\nof a sliver moon versus a fuller moon, or\na half moon, or whatever we were doing.\n\n320\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.400\nThis is the exact same idea.\n\n321\n00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.510\nYou're knocking out the hole,\nI could move this around,\n\n322\n00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:44.300\nI could change where the hole is,\nor like where it's excluding.\n\n323\n00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.530\nit's not a full commit\njust like you just did.\n\n324\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; The double clicking and\n\n325\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.220\nit's not a white circle.\n\n326\n00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.937\nIt's a knocked out shape,\nit's a knock out hole, punch the hole.\n\n327\n00:15:53.937 --> 00:15:55.979\n&gt;&gt; Which will make a difference.\n\n328\n00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:57.368\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes people just think,\n\n329\n00:15:57.368 --> 00:16:00.748\nwell why can't I just put a white circle\non there and give the appearance of that?\n\n330\n00:16:00.748 --> 00:16:05.684\nWell, What if you had a logo and\nyou wanted to place that logo on an image?\n\n331\n00:16:05.684 --> 00:16:07.711\nIf I want to place it on an image,\n\n332\n00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:12.678\nI don't want a white circle there I want\nto be able to see the background there.\n\n333\n00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:16.500\nAnd so you could kind of\nthink about that example or\n\n334\n00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.685\nlikewise Vonne had a great example of a B.\n\n335\n00:16:19.685 --> 00:16:25.107\nSo if I take a B,\nwe'll go back to our outline text here.\n\n336\n00:16:25.107 --> 00:16:26.960\nIf I have a B, like an actual letter B,\nnot a bumblebee,\n\n337\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.833\n[LAUGH] an actual letter B.\n\n338\n00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:30.481\nAnd then I do my create outlines kind\n\n339\n00:16:30.481 --> 00:16:35.120\nof like what we've discussed\nin a different episode.\n\n340\n00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.972\nCreate outlines there and\nit's like okay yeah, looks like a B still.\n\n341\n00:16:38.972 --> 00:16:40.410\nBut what you'll see, okay.\n\n342\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.430\nI right click, I don't have the option for\na compound path here but\n\n343\n00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:48.130\nif I go into my object menu and then I\ngo all the way down to compound path,\n\n344\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.380\nyou see all the way down\nthere at the bottom.\n\n345\n00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.340\nAnd then go ahead and\n\n346\n00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:58.240\nrelease what you're gonna see is that\nB is basically just a compound path.\n\n347\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.900\nSo that's really how it's being created.\n\n348\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.820\nSo it's kind of one of those\nthings that's when you're starting\n\n349\n00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.100\nout you make look at it and be like, I\ndon't really know when I'm gonna use this.\n\n350\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.320\nBut it's kind of a fundamental\nin Illustrator, I think.\n\n351\n00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.640\n&gt;&gt; And right here, since we released\nthe compound path, if you selected all of\n\n352\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.260\nthose and then said make compound path,\nit's going to do just like what.\n\n353\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.270\n&gt;&gt; It yea, where you have to go\nto the objects menu, but yea.\n\n354\n00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.070\n&gt;&gt; I think if you ungroup it first.\n\n355\n00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.140\n&gt;&gt; Yea, well that didn't come up.\n\n356\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.630\nYea, I'll have to ungroup it,\nyou're right.\n\n357\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.860\n&gt;&gt; Yea, ungroup it, and\nthen it should be able to select it all,\n\n358\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.060\nnow you should be able to do, even if\nyou right click, even right there, make.\n\n359\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.409\nYea, so\nwe had to kind of take it out of its group\n\n360\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.650\nelement that it always is going to be once\nyou convert it from text to outlines.\n\n361\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.450\nBut right here and cuz you had only\ndid like one circle and one circle.\n\n362\n00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:48.540\nYou can have multiple circles like\nSwiss cheese if you want to say.\n\n363\n00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.050\nAnd all these circles knocking\nout the holes in the other ones.\n\n364\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.896\nAnd usually,\nsee where I'm going with this?\n\n365\n00:17:55.896 --> 00:17:56.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n366\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It usually knock out all\n\n367\n00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.160\nof the places where two paths overlap.\n\n368\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.620\nSo that is one of the keys\nwith the compound path.\n\n369\n00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.760\nIt's two paths, path to overlap.\n\n370\n00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.470\nAnd now this you're like well, there's\nthree paths overlapping, but you seen in\n\n371\n00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.785\nthe middle, like the middle of this,\nI always call this the biohazard label.\n\n372\n00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's a good example.\n\n373\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:26.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, that the middle part of\nthis, that's not going to get knocked out\n\n374\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.340\nbecause that's where all three\npaths overlap each other.\n\n375\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:36.640\nThat will not get knocked out, but where\nthe places where the two paths overlap,\n\n376\n00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.360\nthose are where the holes are gonna get\nknocked out in this particular example.\n\n377\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.230\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n378\n00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.540\nCuz people are like,\nI want the middle part knocked out.\n\n379\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:49.200\nI was like, that's a totally different\nkind of concept or even technique.\n\n380\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.320\nAnd then I'm like, how would I do that?\n\n381\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.481\nBut anyways-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:18:52.481 --> 00:18:54.590\n&gt;&gt; This one is two overlapping paths.\n\n383\n00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.425\nDo we wanna go there?\n\n384\n00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:56.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess\n\n385\n00:18:56.202 --> 00:18:56.800\nwe could go to-\n\n386\n00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.858\n&gt;&gt; The\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n387\n00:18:57.858 --> 00:19:00.934\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes all the holes don't get\n\n388\n00:19:00.934 --> 00:19:02.250\nknocked out.\n\n389\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.610\nAnd our example is like, every single one.\n\n390\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI think it worked out in our example.\n\n391\n00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI was kind of expecting it to not.\n\n392\n00:19:11.925 --> 00:19:12.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n393\n00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.506\nI know of course I was like\n&gt;&gt; Darn it, they all didn't.\n\n394\n00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:16.041\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n395\n00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:19.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We wanted the end results of B.\n\n396\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I wanted to happen.\n\n397\n00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.650\nAnd then it's doing it again.\n\n398\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, how about this?\n\n399\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.040\nEven if ours works just perfectly and\n\n400\n00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.840\nyours does not knockout all of the holes\nwhere the two paths are overlapping.\n\n401\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.508\n&gt;&gt; Let's go there.\n\n402\n00:19:34.508 --> 00:19:35.265\nSo yes.\n\n403\n00:19:35.265 --> 00:19:37.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sitting here.\n\n404\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.140\nI'm just trying to make\nit not work correctly.\n\n405\n00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.650\nDang it the one time you\nwanted something to go wrong.\n\n406\n00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:47.660\nSo if I go into my window menu and\nthen I grab my attributes panel.\n\n407\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.360\nWhat you're gonna choose it's\na pretty small little button here.\n\n408\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.810\nIf you go kinda to the middle here.\n\n409\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.255\nIt looks like to me,\nit looks like a washing machine.\n\n410\n00:19:57.255 --> 00:20:00.100\n[LAUGH] You see a washing machine\nthat's totally filled in and\n\n411\n00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.640\nthen you see kind of a washing\nmachine which basically just a white\n\n412\n00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.630\nsquare with the black\nhole in the middle of it.\n\n413\n00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:09.200\nIf you go ahead and click on that, that's\ngonna tell you to use the even-odd fill\n\n414\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.680\nrule versus what it set at right now,\nwhich is nonzero winding fill rule.\n\n415\n00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.520\nWhich I know this sounds very\ncomplicated to me as well.\n\n416\n00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.628\nYou click on.\n\n417\n00:20:19.628 --> 00:20:21.396\nIf it's not knocking out all the holes,\n\n418\n00:20:21.396 --> 00:20:24.720\nit's gonna knock right all the holes for\nyou.\n\n419\n00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is one of those, where\nwe talked about this before the show.\n\n420\n00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:32.261\nI was like I don't know the technical\ndefinition of non-zero winding.\n\n421\n00:20:32.261 --> 00:20:35.840\nBut I know I've looked this up and\nI know I had it memorized it at one point.\n\n422\n00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.570\nEspecially, cuz I thought it was gonna\nbe the question on the ACE test.\n\n423\n00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:45.540\nAnd so I was like yeah I memorized\nthe technical definition I don't remember.\n\n424\n00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.240\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea [LAUGH].\n\n425\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.870\n&gt;&gt; Just make sure you know\nif the attributes panel\n\n426\n00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.180\nare those two little buttons\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n427\n00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:56.675\nnormally if you don't knock all the holes,\nclick on the other one that's not.\n\n428\n00:20:56.675 --> 00:20:57.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, right.\n\n429\n00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Which usually is the non-fill rule and\n\n430\n00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.860\nit'll knock out all the paths in there,\nso.\n\n431\n00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nwhich of course we can replicate.\n\n432\n00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:03.521\n&gt;&gt; I know, right.\n\n433\n00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:06.664\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the reality of this situation.\n\n434\n00:21:06.664 --> 00:21:09.347\nBut yeah,\nthat's exactly what you would do.\n\n435\n00:21:09.347 --> 00:21:12.410\nAnd did we miss anything\nwith Pathfinder's not?\n\n436\n00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.450\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so because we\ntalked about the main difference of\n\n437\n00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:21.016\nthe Pathfinder of getting it, the melding,\nor the changing the chemical composition.\n\n438\n00:21:21.016 --> 00:21:23.040\nYes, sorry, Mrs..\n\n439\n00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.105\nI think I'm getting it right.\n\n440\n00:21:25.105 --> 00:21:27.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And when to use a compound path.\n\n441\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.650\nAnd also, I like that we went to the menu,\n\n442\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.500\nthat object menu all the way down at\ncompound path, and the make and release.\n\n443\n00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.220\nSo being able to turn off or\nrelease the compound path, getting it\n\n444\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.680\nback into the individual shapes,\nthen turning it back into a compound path,\n\n445\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.490\nalso the isolation mode that\nyou went ahead and did.\n\n446\n00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.990\nAnd yeah, it's just one of those\nthings you have to get used to and\n\n447\n00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:55.010\nyou have to kinda keep experiencing it\nbefore it kinda really drives home.\n\n448\n00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.570\nBut you will see this more than\nyou think you're gonna see it so\n\n449\n00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.740\nand even that outline test.\n\n450\n00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.110\nWell I just did a complete summary [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, you did the summary for me.\n\n451\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.710\n[LAUGH] Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n452\n00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:14.030\nAll right, well I think we're gonna go\nahead and wrap this one up for everybody.\n\n453\n00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.120\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off fo Creative Pro TV.\n\n454\n00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.930\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n455\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:18.860\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n456\n00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.970\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n457\n00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.555\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\nexciting edition of CreativeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:20.024\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\nwe're continuing on with our Illustrator\n\n5\n00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:24.370\n2017 CC series, and\nI messed it up it's Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n6\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.362\nBut that's okay, you all know what\nwe're doing, we're in Illustrator.\n\n7\n00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:30.839\nAnd luckily I have Emily here\nto help keep me on path.\n\n8\n00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:31.742\nDid you hear that?\n\n9\n00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:33.563\n&gt;&gt; I got it, I got you.\n\n10\n00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:35.376\n&gt;&gt; You're my family, welcome back.\n\n11\n00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:36.807\n&gt;&gt; I love it, I love it Thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:39.077\nYeah, we all know what\nyou're talking about.\n\n13\n00:00:39.077 --> 00:00:40.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n14\n00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:41.937\nIllustrator that's what\nwe're getting into.\n\n15\n00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:46.620\nWhen we're getting into path editing tools\nI think is what we have called this.\n\n16\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.514\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is another one where\nwe're like what do we call this?\n\n17\n00:00:50.514 --> 00:00:51.198\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:52.553\n&gt;&gt; What is the title of this episode?\n\n19\n00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:57.059\nBecause we're getting into\nthe nitty gritty of illustrator.\n\n20\n00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.205\nWhere we're gonna start editing our path.\n\n21\n00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:02.879\nThis is also a precursor\nto our Pen Tool as well.\n\n22\n00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.220\nThe dreaded Pen Tool.\n\n23\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.461\nIt's honestly the best thing\never once you get used to it.\n\n24\n00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:11.698\nBut this is kind of a warmup to where\nwe're gonna do some kind of cool tools,\n\n25\n00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:13.397\nget the concepts down right?\n\n26\n00:01:13.397 --> 00:01:17.393\nStraight path, Curved path,\nBézier handles.\n\n27\n00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:20.729\n&gt;&gt; One of my favorite words to\nsay in life is Bézier handles.\n\n28\n00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.363\nYeah, it's just I think it makes me so\nfancy, right?\n\n29\n00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:24.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, exactly,\n\n30\n00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:26.237\nwe're gonna be getting\ninto some path editing.\n\n31\n00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:29.741\nNow you may be thinking, okay, I feel like\nwe've already done some path editing, and\n\n32\n00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:30.369\nthat's true.\n\n33\n00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.151\nThere are tools and tricks and\n\n34\n00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:35.579\nthings that you can do in\nIllustrator to edit your paths.\n\n35\n00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.286\nI mean, it's a pretty generic term.\n\n36\n00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:42.209\nBut what we're gonna be looking at here\nis specifically really kind of starting\n\n37\n00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.588\nto manipulate and dig deep,\nand manipulate points and\n\n38\n00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:48.386\nreally transform to your heart’s content.\n\n39\n00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:51.986\nYou’re not gonna be using any specific\ntool that’s just gonna do it one way.\n\n40\n00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.348\nYou’re gonna do it your own way here and\n\n41\n00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:55.134\nthat’s where it’s gonna\nget a little different.\n\n42\n00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:59.013\n&gt;&gt; And I think also up until this point,\nif you’re watching in sequence,\n\n43\n00:01:59.013 --> 00:02:02.390\nwe have been treating the path,\nlike you said the path shape.\n\n44\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.287\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n45\n00:02:03.287 --> 00:02:05.801\n&gt;&gt; We've been treating the shape\nas like its whole entity.\n\n46\n00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:09.091\nWe have used the pencil and the brush and\nit is like, here we can kind of do this.\n\n47\n00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:12.892\nNow, nitty gritty,\nwe are getting to the point.\n\n48\n00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:13.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:13.586 --> 00:02:14.902\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Literally,\n\n50\n00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:18.928\nwe are getting to the point on the path\nin editing those particular pieces.\n\n51\n00:02:18.928 --> 00:02:22.688\nNot the path itself but\nit is the path, yeah see we're,\n\n52\n00:02:22.688 --> 00:02:25.889\nI feel it it's like a chick and\nthe egg, right?\n\n53\n00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which one which,\n\n54\n00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.367\nI don't even know cause a point\nis a path a path the point.\n\n55\n00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:32.444\nI'm gonna stop\n&gt;&gt; Let's show you.\n\n56\n00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:32.952\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n57\n00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.748\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n58\n00:02:34.748 --> 00:02:36.714\n[LAUGH] I think the best way to explain is\njust to go ahead and look at it, right?\n\n59\n00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:41.608\nOkay, so what we're gonna do, we are going\nto start with the easiest thing and\n\n60\n00:02:41.608 --> 00:02:42.659\nstraight path.\n\n61\n00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.989\nSo [LAUGH] let's just go ahead and\nmake a square.\n\n62\n00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.031\nYou've been watching this for awhile.\n\n63\n00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:49.150\nI know you're probably sick\nof seeing a square, but\n\n64\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.231\nyou're about to see some\nreally funky stuff here.\n\n65\n00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:55.519\nSo what I wanna kinda point out to you,\nwe're gonna be working a lot here with\n\n66\n00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.680\nthis selection tool versus\nthe direct selection tool.\n\n67\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.465\nOr if you're like me I just call them\nthe black arrow versus to the white arrow.\n\n68\n00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:05.887\nThe black arrow which we have been using\nup until this point, which is amazing,\n\n69\n00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:08.140\nit's very neutral, does everything.\n\n70\n00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.723\nWhat you notice with that is that it\nselects the entire path on its own,\n\n71\n00:03:11.723 --> 00:03:13.504\nkinda like what Vonne was saying.\n\n72\n00:03:13.504 --> 00:03:17.815\nEverything we've done up until this point\nhas selected the path in its entirety.\n\n73\n00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:22.460\nWhere we get into the white arrow tool,\nor our direct selection tool,\n\n74\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.991\nwe are going to edit specific points.\n\n75\n00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:26.486\nSo, what we can do?\n\n76\n00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:29.027\nIf I go ahead and\ngrab that direct selection tool,\n\n77\n00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:32.779\nyou see how we kinda went from like\nthose white boxes around everything and\n\n78\n00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.122\nwe had them even in the middle\nthere to our direct selection tool.\n\n79\n00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:40.375\nNow, specifically what we're looking at\nthose filled in blue boxes kind of on each\n\n80\n00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:41.482\nof the four corners.\n\n81\n00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:44.204\nThose are our actual points.\n\n82\n00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:47.262\nSo, what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna go ahead and select one.\n\n83\n00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:50.644\nYou see when I select one, and\nI can see if I can kinda zoom in here.\n\n84\n00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:55.037\nWhen I select one I'll use my fancy,\nI'm still working on this.\n\n85\n00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:58.934\nThat one gets filled in and\nthen the other ones kinda stay white,\n\n86\n00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:03.059\nthat just lets me know that I have\nthat one particular one selected.\n\n87\n00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:05.129\nNow let me scroll out here.\n\n88\n00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.332\nIt always takes me a second.\n\n89\n00:04:06.332 --> 00:04:10.751\nAnd what I can do there,\nI can then manipulate that any way I want.\n\n90\n00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.342\nNow there's a reason we're\nstarting with straight paths.\n\n91\n00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:17.012\nThere's a specific reason why I\ndid this first with a rectangle.\n\n92\n00:04:17.012 --> 00:04:18.953\nCuz this is going to be, quite frankly,\n\n93\n00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:22.161\na lot easier than what we're gonna\nget into with our curved paths.\n\n94\n00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:25.924\nBut this is kinda nice, I mean you\ncan see how you can take this and\n\n95\n00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:28.039\nbe like, I made myself a triangle.\n\n96\n00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.332\nIf you've been wondering how to make\na triangle, this is one option.\n\n97\n00:04:31.332 --> 00:04:34.448\nThere are other options,\nbut this is one of them.\n\n98\n00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:36.991\nSo you can kinda see,\nokay I can edit that around.\n\n99\n00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:40.263\nAnd when you start to feel kinda\ncomfortable, move over here,\n\n100\n00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:43.486\nsee what that does, go ahead,\nmanipulate that a little bit.\n\n101\n00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:46.851\nYou can see how it's almost creating\nthat sheer that we were talking about\n\n102\n00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:48.653\nwith some of our free transform tools.\n\n103\n00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:52.995\nBut if you watched that episode you\nremember us mentioning a lot of times we\n\n104\n00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.315\njust do that with the white arrow tool.\n\n105\n00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:57.596\nThis is kind of an example of that,\ncuz to me,\n\n106\n00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:00.130\nI find this just to be\na little bit more intuitive.\n\n107\n00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.157\nI can see exactly what I'm\ntrying to move versus,\n\n108\n00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:05.472\nusing some of those transform tools.\n\n109\n00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.880\nI would think that Vonne,\nyou would definitely agree.\n\n110\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.077\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just gonna say like that we\nsaw those in the sheer, the free transform\n\n111\n00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:15.683\ntools, all those, basically\nrepeating everything you just said.\n\n112\n00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:20.481\n[LAUGH] But those were,\nif you're thinking that at home too, yeah,\n\n113\n00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:25.363\nthis is that kind of alternate way\nof getting to the same visual result\n\n114\n00:05:25.363 --> 00:05:27.990\nis just which tool do you want to use.\n\n115\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.433\nAnd you probably realized that\nIllustrator has a lot of these things and\n\n116\n00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:36.505\nas were as each individual user\nof Illustrator, you go for like,\n\n117\n00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:38.887\nwhat you feel most comfortable with.\n\n118\n00:05:38.887 --> 00:05:39.979\nAnd I know you and I,\n\n119\n00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.915\nI'm always gonna go the way the White\nArrow tool to do some of that stuff.\n\n120\n00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:46.024\nAnd as we've been going\nthrough these lessons,\n\n121\n00:05:46.024 --> 00:05:48.191\nI'm like yeah I forgot\nthat tool can do that.\n\n122\n00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:52.304\nAnd I've kind of been going\nsometimes the harder way.\n\n123\n00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:52.822\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n124\n00:05:52.822 --> 00:05:55.107\n&gt;&gt; When I could have\njust used that tool but\n\n125\n00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:59.063\nit's just go with whatever take\nwhatever path you may want to take.\n\n126\n00:05:59.063 --> 00:06:00.707\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like it, I like it, no pun intended.\n\n127\n00:06:00.707 --> 00:06:01.427\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n128\n00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:03.617\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah, you'll see here.\n\n129\n00:06:03.617 --> 00:06:06.109\nWhat I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust grab the middle of this.\n\n130\n00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:07.124\nAnd I only do that so\n\n131\n00:06:07.124 --> 00:06:10.556\nyou can point out that this can\nactually select the entire path.\n\n132\n00:06:10.556 --> 00:06:12.605\nSo it is possible to\nselect the entire path.\n\n133\n00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:16.988\nAnd you'll see when I do that all four\nof these blue points are filled in.\n\n134\n00:06:16.988 --> 00:06:20.804\nSo you just have to go off with\nwhatever blue point is filled in.\n\n135\n00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:23.920\nSo it's actually filled in blue, so\nif I go ahead and just select this one,\n\n136\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.906\nall those other ones\nare gonna go back to white.\n\n137\n00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:29.551\nJust be aware of what you have\nselected versus what you don't.\n\n138\n00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:32.695\nYou can edit two paths at the same time,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n139\n00:06:32.695 --> 00:06:35.041\nYou just have to be aware\nwhen you're doing it.\n\n140\n00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:37.993\nSo, if I do want to, say make\nsomething more like that cheer and\n\n141\n00:06:37.993 --> 00:06:40.076\nI want to edit both of\nthese at the same time.\n\n142\n00:06:40.076 --> 00:06:43.573\nIt's gonna be very similar to\nselecting two objects together.\n\n143\n00:06:43.573 --> 00:06:47.199\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nShift-click this point here and\n\n144\n00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.682\nI can go ahead and\nnow drag both of those sides in and out.\n\n145\n00:06:50.682 --> 00:06:54.582\nRather than if I just select this one,\nyou see that one goes back to white, and\n\n146\n00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:56.032\nI can go ahead and edit that.\n\n147\n00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:58.825\nSo straight paths I\ndefinitely think are fun.\n\n148\n00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:02.432\nI'm gonna throw in a little\ncurve ball in here with you.\n\n149\n00:07:02.432 --> 00:07:05.732\nAnd I wanna go ahead and\nstart introducing some of our,\n\n150\n00:07:05.732 --> 00:07:08.473\nkind of add and\nsubtract anchor point tools.\n\n151\n00:07:08.473 --> 00:07:10.973\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust kind of start from scratch.\n\n152\n00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:12.833\nDraw another square.\n\n153\n00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:16.887\nAnd then rather than going, or\nwe can go into our Direct Selection Tool,\n\n154\n00:07:16.887 --> 00:07:17.758\nthat's fine.\n\n155\n00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:19.196\nGo ahead and grab your white arrow.\n\n156\n00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:23.780\nBut what we're really gonna work with is\nwe're going to go not into our Pen Tool\n\n157\n00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.262\nwith like she said,\nthis is kind of a lead up to our Pen Tool.\n\n158\n00:07:27.262 --> 00:07:30.105\nSo I wanna go ahead and\ngrab that Add Anchor Point Tool.\n\n159\n00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:33.535\nSo I'm just gonna click and hold on\nthe pen, graph my Add Anchor Point Tool.\n\n160\n00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:35.578\nYou could also hit just\nthe plus sign on your keyboard.\n\n161\n00:07:35.578 --> 00:07:36.968\nGo ahead and select that.\n\n162\n00:07:36.968 --> 00:07:40.341\nAnd then now what I'm gonna do you'll\nsee you'll get that little pen but\n\n163\n00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:42.011\nit has a little plus sign next to it.\n\n164\n00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:44.657\nI'm just gonna hover some\naround the outside of my path.\n\n165\n00:07:44.657 --> 00:07:50.418\nAnytime that you are actually on the path\nyou will see in pink that word path.\n\n166\n00:07:50.418 --> 00:07:53.505\nAnd that just Illustrator's way to\nkinda letting you know where you're at.\n\n167\n00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:56.253\nSo, I can go ahead and\nsingle click on this.\n\n168\n00:07:56.253 --> 00:08:00.901\nAnd now you can see I have\nadded a point to my path.\n\n169\n00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:05.488\nSo, I had these for and then now I\nhave this additional one at the top.\n\n170\n00:08:05.488 --> 00:08:07.176\nSo what can I do?\n\n171\n00:08:07.176 --> 00:08:07.978\nI can now manipulate that.\n\n172\n00:08:07.978 --> 00:08:11.682\nSo I can take something like this and\nmake it look like a house basically.\n\n173\n00:08:11.682 --> 00:08:16.431\nSo you've done really some very\nsimple drawing from just adding one\n\n174\n00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.193\nadditional point to it.\n\n175\n00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:21.836\nLikewise, if you have\nthe Add Anchor Point tool,\n\n176\n00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:24.891\nyou also have a Delete Anchor Point tool.\n\n177\n00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:26.959\nSo I'm gonna click and hold on that again,\n\n178\n00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:30.578\njust where we got the Add Anchor Point\ntool or our Delete Anchor Point tool,\n\n179\n00:08:30.578 --> 00:08:32.948\nyou just hit that kinda\nhyphen on your keyboard.\n\n180\n00:08:32.948 --> 00:08:34.363\nGo ahead and select that.\n\n181\n00:08:34.363 --> 00:08:37.692\nNow what if I wanted to get rid of\nthis one in the top left-hand corner?\n\n182\n00:08:37.692 --> 00:08:41.089\nI'm just gonna single-click on an anchor\npoint that's already existing and\n\n183\n00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:42.023\ngo ahead and do that.\n\n184\n00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:45.562\nAnd now you see I mentioned before,\nthat was one way to create a triangle,\n\n185\n00:08:45.562 --> 00:08:48.148\nthat is another way to go ahead and\ncreate a triangle.\n\n186\n00:08:48.148 --> 00:08:49.725\nYou can see you can use that.\n\n187\n00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:54.341\nSo that is another option available to you\nto go ahead and delete that anchor point.\n\n188\n00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:58.019\nSo it really just depends on what you're\ndoing of course you know how many entry\n\n189\n00:08:58.019 --> 00:08:59.534\npoints we need to add or delete.\n\n190\n00:08:59.534 --> 00:09:03.984\nBe aware that right now what we're\ndoing is editing pre existing shapes,\n\n191\n00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:05.573\nwe're not creating new.\n\n192\n00:09:05.573 --> 00:09:07.985\nThat might look a little bit different for\nyou then.\n\n193\n00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:11.434\nBut right now for what we're doing,\nyou know of course just be aware, okay?\n\n194\n00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:14.231\nIf I wanna make something looks\nlike a house, how this house works?\n\n195\n00:09:14.231 --> 00:09:17.238\nWhat do I need to add, subtract,\ndelete, things like that.\n\n196\n00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:19.996\nSo, that kinda gives us a basis.\n\n197\n00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:24.465\nNow, I mentioned where it starts to get a\nlittle wonky on us is when we get into our\n\n198\n00:09:24.465 --> 00:09:25.351\ncurved paths.\n\n199\n00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:31.904\nThis is always kind of the dun dun dun,\nthe dreaded cue theme music here.\n\n200\n00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:35.273\nSo what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go\nahead and grab my ellipse tool.\n\n201\n00:09:35.273 --> 00:09:38.968\nI say scary, but also I think it\ncan be a little bit more fun, too.\n\n202\n00:09:38.968 --> 00:09:40.615\nSo when I go ahead and grab that,\n\n203\n00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:43.361\nnow I'm gonna go back into\nmy direct selection tool.\n\n204\n00:09:43.361 --> 00:09:45.890\nYou're probably thinking okay,\ndoesn't look to bad, it's pretty nice.\n\n205\n00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.685\nI don't know what she's talking about.\n\n206\n00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:50.899\nWhat gets kinda fancy,\nwhen I go ahead and select that.\n\n207\n00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:53.813\nSo see, I have the top point selected and\nit's like whoa,\n\n208\n00:09:53.813 --> 00:09:56.800\nwhat are those little handlebar\nthings that just came out?\n\n209\n00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:02.074\nThos are bezier handles or bezier curves\nyou can kinda use the two interchangeably.\n\n210\n00:10:02.074 --> 00:10:05.697\nThese handle act like a see-saw.\n\n211\n00:10:05.697 --> 00:10:08.841\nSo you see you can kinda move your point,\nyeah, and\n\n212\n00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:13.669\nthat's gonna be very similar to moving or\nsomewhat similar to moving a point,\n\n213\n00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:18.737\nlike I did with my straight paths but my\nbezier handles do, they act like a seesaw.\n\n214\n00:10:18.737 --> 00:10:22.975\nSo they change both the direction and\nthe amplitude of your curve.\n\n215\n00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:27.194\nSo what happens is if I take this one side\nup, now I'm moving the actual handle.\n\n216\n00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:29.176\nI'm not moving the point itself.\n\n217\n00:10:29.176 --> 00:10:34.087\nIf I move the handlebar up,\nyou'll see it's gonna take that curve and\n\n218\n00:10:34.087 --> 00:10:35.345\nkinda flip it up.\n\n219\n00:10:35.345 --> 00:10:38.061\nBut then on the other side,\nit flips that down.\n\n220\n00:10:38.061 --> 00:10:39.932\nSo that's where we get that kinda seesaw.\n\n221\n00:10:39.932 --> 00:10:42.749\nSo it's gonna change the direction and\nthe amplitude.\n\n222\n00:10:42.749 --> 00:10:46.120\nNow part of where that amplitude comes\nin is note that I can stretch this out.\n\n223\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.212\nI feel like that's Elvis or something.\n\n224\n00:10:50.212 --> 00:10:53.274\n[LAUGH] I don't know, it's dancing for me.\n\n225\n00:10:53.274 --> 00:10:54.723\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's like hey,\nhow you doing there?\n\n226\n00:10:54.723 --> 00:10:55.457\nWhat's up?\n\n227\n00:10:55.457 --> 00:10:56.639\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n228\n00:10:56.639 --> 00:10:58.463\n[LAUGH] I don't know where that came from,\nbut\n\n229\n00:10:58.463 --> 00:11:01.495\nyes that's just what was going through\nmy head, in case you were curious.\n\n230\n00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:06.053\nSo, you have that, and that's kind of\nadjusting that amplitude of that curve.\n\n231\n00:11:06.053 --> 00:11:09.578\nNow, my suggestion to you with this one,\npractice.\n\n232\n00:11:09.578 --> 00:11:11.841\nJust keep practicing over and\nover again, and\n\n233\n00:11:11.841 --> 00:11:14.640\nsee what it looks like in terms\nof adjusting your shapes.\n\n234\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.246\nAnd there's a reason why we do\nthis as a lead-in to the pen tool.\n\n235\n00:11:18.246 --> 00:11:21.039\nCuz, certainly, if you've had any\nexperience with the pen tool,\n\n236\n00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.267\nif you've heard of it at all.\n\n237\n00:11:22.267 --> 00:11:23.623\nThat's definitely,\n\n238\n00:11:23.623 --> 00:11:27.554\nthis concept is gonna come into\nplay when we get into the pen tool.\n\n239\n00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:31.666\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the whole idea about\na see-saw is like one changes the other.\n\n240\n00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:34.575\nNow, the amplitude,\nyou see on this example,\n\n241\n00:11:34.575 --> 00:11:38.305\nlike on the right side you can\npull that out a little bit more.\n\n242\n00:11:38.305 --> 00:11:43.171\nBut if you change like the direction,\nthe other one moves too.\n\n243\n00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:45.577\nAnd I think that's the thing\nthat kinda trips people up is.\n\n244\n00:11:45.577 --> 00:11:47.663\nIt's like why is it moving the other side?\n\n245\n00:11:47.663 --> 00:11:49.582\nWell, they're all connected,\n\n246\n00:11:49.582 --> 00:11:53.897\nbecause it's all about how the path if\nyou wanna say comes in to the point and\n\n247\n00:11:53.897 --> 00:11:58.167\nthen comes out of the point and\nthat's where you start making the curves.\n\n248\n00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:04.396\nAnd that's again all scientific and\nmathematical but this is back to math.\n\n249\n00:12:04.396 --> 00:12:08.582\nAnd if you type in Bezier curves\nyou'll see in like any Wikipedia or\n\n250\n00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:11.965\nanything online that's\ngonna start talking about.\n\n251\n00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:15.403\nIt's all about math and\na French mathematician named,\n\n252\n00:12:15.403 --> 00:12:15.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:12:15.995 --> 00:12:16.559\n&gt;&gt; Something,\n\n254\n00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:19.119\nsomething Bezier and he was actually,\n&gt;&gt; In all cursive.\n\n255\n00:12:19.119 --> 00:12:20.808\n[LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n256\n00:12:20.808 --> 00:12:21.689\n&gt;&gt; For creating this.\n\n257\n00:12:21.689 --> 00:12:26.704\n&gt;&gt; He was actually hired or was working\nwith an automotive firm to be able\n\n258\n00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:31.468\nto see how they can actually draw cars and\nhow it makes the curves.\n\n259\n00:12:31.468 --> 00:12:34.725\n&gt;&gt; Look it up, read the Wikipedia\narticle on it, it's pretty interesting.\n\n260\n00:12:34.725 --> 00:12:36.762\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing what you\ncan find on Wikipedia.\n\n261\n00:12:36.762 --> 00:12:37.563\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n262\n00:12:37.563 --> 00:12:38.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's awesome.\n\n263\n00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.234\n[LAUGH] That's why I always donate\nthe $3 every time they ask me.\n\n264\n00:12:41.234 --> 00:12:41.762\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n265\n00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:43.141\n&gt;&gt; Okay, fine.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I use you so\n\n266\n00:12:43.141 --> 00:12:45.636\nmuch that I'll go ahead and\ngive you the $3.\n\n267\n00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:46.570\n&gt;&gt; I'll just give you the $3.\n\n268\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.613\nSo yeah, exactly, and I went ahead and\nspelled out Bezier in case you're probably\n\n269\n00:12:50.613 --> 00:12:54.331\nthinking I don't know how to Google that,\ncuz I don't know how to spell it.\n\n270\n00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:55.376\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At least I'm\n\n271\n00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:57.219\nconfident that that's how it's spelled.\n\n272\n00:12:57.219 --> 00:12:59.921\nI don't speak French,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n273\n00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:04.166\nSo yes, that see-saw thing that's always\njust what's gonna trip you to pull up.\n\n274\n00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:07.439\nSo just keep practicing with it, you\ncan kinda see okay, I can go like that,\n\n275\n00:13:07.439 --> 00:13:08.371\nI can kinda balance.\n\n276\n00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:12.521\nI can maybe get a little fancy,\nstart moving these around.\n\n277\n00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:15.279\nKinda change the amplitude of this one.\n\n278\n00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:19.900\nNow, where you change this see saw,\nif you will, the direction of the curve.\n\n279\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.292\nEvery time you change the direction\nof one, it goes the other way.\n\n280\n00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:25.485\nSo that see saw method.\n\n281\n00:13:25.485 --> 00:13:28.426\nNow, you will notice that you don't have\nthat necessarily with the amplitude.\n\n282\n00:13:28.426 --> 00:13:31.139\nSo just because I make this\none really really long.\n\n283\n00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:34.425\nThis one stays the same length,\nso that is something to mention.\n\n284\n00:13:34.425 --> 00:13:39.344\nOnly the direction or that kinda see saw\nis what's gonna change the amplitude of it\n\n285\n00:13:39.344 --> 00:13:41.781\nis gonna stay the same on the other side.\n\n286\n00:13:41.781 --> 00:13:45.149\nSo that's something that\nI would point out to you.\n\n287\n00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:48.478\nAnd again, just continue to play with it,\ncontinue to practice with it.\n\n288\n00:13:48.478 --> 00:13:52.586\nNow, there is one thing that I\nwanted to point out with this and\n\n289\n00:13:52.586 --> 00:13:55.117\nwe'll just start with a new one here.\n\n290\n00:13:55.117 --> 00:13:59.147\nThe Anchor Point tool, so kinda like what\nwe've been using with our Add Anchor Point\n\n291\n00:13:59.147 --> 00:14:01.044\ntool and our Delete Anchor Point tool.\n\n292\n00:14:01.044 --> 00:14:03.474\nOur Anchor Point tool, oops, excuse me,\n\n293\n00:14:03.474 --> 00:14:07.737\nwill change a straight path just clicking\nall kinds of random things here.\n\n294\n00:14:07.737 --> 00:14:13.191\nWill change a straight path to a curved\npath and a curved path to a straight path.\n\n295\n00:14:13.191 --> 00:14:15.014\nWell, I've already said that,\nit flips the two basically.\n\n296\n00:14:15.014 --> 00:14:18.642\nAnd so what we'll do here, when I'm\nlooking at this, it's okay, all right,\n\n297\n00:14:18.642 --> 00:14:20.060\nwhat if I have this rectangle?\n\n298\n00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.571\nAnd I want it to be a curve, but\n\n299\n00:14:21.571 --> 00:14:25.457\nI don't have a way of making it a curve\nbecause I don't have a Bezier handle.\n\n300\n00:14:25.457 --> 00:14:27.947\nHow do I make that Bezier handle?\n\n301\n00:14:27.947 --> 00:14:30.291\nThat's gonna be through\nour Anchor Point tool.\n\n302\n00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:32.781\nSo I'm gonna go ahead here, right\nunderneath that Delete Anchor Point tool,\n\n303\n00:14:32.781 --> 00:14:33.883\nit's just the Anchor Point tool.\n\n304\n00:14:33.883 --> 00:14:37.167\nIf you are in an older version,\nif you've seen it in an older version,\n\n305\n00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:40.972\nit used to be called the Convert Anchor\nPoint tool, they just shortened it on us.\n\n306\n00:14:40.972 --> 00:14:44.752\nSo what we can do here, if I click,\nhold, and drag I need to,\n\n307\n00:14:44.752 --> 00:14:46.541\nI just can't single click.\n\n308\n00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:49.628\nYou can single click on curved path,\nbut I'm taking a straight path here,\n\n309\n00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:50.167\nright here.\n\n310\n00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:54.723\nAnd I need to click on drag because I need\nto create that direction in the amplitude\n\n311\n00:14:54.723 --> 00:14:55.465\nof my curve.\n\n312\n00:14:55.465 --> 00:14:59.821\nSo if I take this and I click, hold and\ndrag, you'll see I can go ahead and\n\n313\n00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:01.548\ncreate that Bezier handle.\n\n314\n00:15:01.548 --> 00:15:04.026\nNow, if I go over here,\nif I select this one and\n\n315\n00:15:04.026 --> 00:15:08.665\nthen take a path that's already curved, so\nI already have these Bezier handles here,\n\n316\n00:15:08.665 --> 00:15:10.463\nyou can kinda see that like that.\n\n317\n00:15:10.463 --> 00:15:14.063\nIf I already have that,\nI don't need to click, hold, and drag.\n\n318\n00:15:14.063 --> 00:15:18.131\nCuz I don't need to create a Bezier\nhandle, all I have to do is just click and\n\n319\n00:15:18.131 --> 00:15:20.336\nthat will convert it to a straight path.\n\n320\n00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:25.328\nSo it's kind of just a matter of figuring\nout exactly what you'll need, and\n\n321\n00:15:25.328 --> 00:15:29.072\nI think we'll see if I can\nremember how to do it properly.\n\n322\n00:15:29.072 --> 00:15:32.191\nPeople always wanna know how to\ncreate a heart in Illustrator.\n\n323\n00:15:32.191 --> 00:15:34.466\n[LAUGH] There are a couple\ndifferent ways to do it.\n\n324\n00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:38.968\nI have a couple different methods that\nI use to do one if I ever need to.\n\n325\n00:15:38.968 --> 00:15:41.454\nUnfortunately it doesn't\nreally come up that much,\n\n326\n00:15:41.454 --> 00:15:43.506\nrealistically in professional purposes.\n\n327\n00:15:43.506 --> 00:15:45.093\nBut you always wanna draw it cuz it's fun.\n\n328\n00:15:45.093 --> 00:15:47.409\nThis is one kind of\nmethod that you can do.\n\n329\n00:15:47.409 --> 00:15:50.415\nI can take this, my circle,\ngo ahead and start with that.\n\n330\n00:15:50.415 --> 00:15:52.641\nClick, hold, and drag this down.\n\n331\n00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:54.546\nClick hold and drag this down.\n\n332\n00:15:54.546 --> 00:15:57.093\nSo you can kinda see okay,\nI have the basis of my heart.\n\n333\n00:15:57.093 --> 00:15:59.306\nNow, one thing that I did here that\nI want to kind of point out to you.\n\n334\n00:15:59.306 --> 00:16:04.405\nI held out my Shift key just to make sure\nthat would stay kinda perfectly in line.\n\n335\n00:16:04.405 --> 00:16:05.904\nYou don't really have to but\n\n336\n00:16:05.904 --> 00:16:09.909\njust be aware sometimes those Shift key\noptions are still available to you.\n\n337\n00:16:09.909 --> 00:16:13.130\nSo I have this okay,\nI can kinda take this down, whatever.\n\n338\n00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.027\nYou can see it kind of looks like a heart,\nwe're getting there.\n\n339\n00:16:16.027 --> 00:16:19.477\nIf I take my Anchor Point tool,\nsingle click on the top one,\n\n340\n00:16:19.477 --> 00:16:21.341\nsingle click on the bottom one.\n\n341\n00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:22.815\nSo those become a straight path.\n\n342\n00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.678\nIt's like wow, it's kinda\ngetting there a little bit more.\n\n343\n00:16:25.678 --> 00:16:29.071\nNow, I take my Direct Selection tool or\nmy White Arrow tool.\n\n344\n00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:32.184\nYou always just kinda get started with\nthese things and then go back and\n\n345\n00:16:32.184 --> 00:16:33.946\nedit with your White Arrow tool later.\n\n346\n00:16:33.946 --> 00:16:35.417\nSo I kinda got started here okay,\n\n347\n00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:37.899\nmaybe I'm gonna drug this\nguide down a little farther.\n\n348\n00:16:37.899 --> 00:16:44.012\nMaybe if I wanna take these and kinda\nadjust my handlebars or my Bezier handles.\n\n349\n00:16:44.012 --> 00:16:46.088\nAnd it's like, okay,\nmaybe I'll kinda drag that out.\n\n350\n00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:49.418\nTake this, kinda drag that out.\n\n351\n00:16:49.418 --> 00:16:50.255\nAnd, you know what?\n\n352\n00:16:50.255 --> 00:16:54.647\nThis is not the most perfect in the world,\nbut that was actually a pretty quick and\n\n353\n00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:56.142\neasy way to create a heart.\n\n354\n00:16:56.142 --> 00:16:58.044\nI might kinda smooth\nthose out a little bit,\n\n355\n00:16:58.044 --> 00:17:00.262\nif I were actually spending\nsome more time on this.\n\n356\n00:17:00.262 --> 00:17:03.593\nBut if you were curious, quick and\neasy, or shouldn't say quick and\n\n357\n00:17:03.593 --> 00:17:05.557\neasy way to do it, but\nit is a way to do it.\n\n358\n00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:10.394\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and another thing\nthat the Convert Anchor Point,\n\n359\n00:17:10.394 --> 00:17:15.348\nsorry, the Anchor Point showed us,\nthe see saw, right?\n\n360\n00:17:15.348 --> 00:17:18.573\nWhen we had our see saw,\nyou said it will always go, like this.\n\n361\n00:17:18.573 --> 00:17:22.701\nWell, the convert anchor point\ntool will also break the see saw.\n\n362\n00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:27.417\nSo, where you can have one act\ndifferently than the other.\n\n363\n00:17:27.417 --> 00:17:30.379\nWhich again,\nlike if you are on that side of the heart.\n\n364\n00:17:30.379 --> 00:17:32.308\nIf you don't mind if I,\nI'm also directing you again.\n\n365\n00:17:32.308 --> 00:17:33.413\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it.\n\n366\n00:17:33.413 --> 00:17:36.500\n&gt;&gt; If you take the White Arrow tool,\nand we go to that one, and\n\n367\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.705\njust grab that point.\n\n368\n00:17:37.705 --> 00:17:42.296\nIf we go to either end of the see saw,\nit's gonna change the other one.\n\n369\n00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:46.550\nBut if we have that still selected,\ngo to the convert, sorry,\n\n370\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.804\nAnchor Point tool, now you grab\nthe end of it, now you can see,\n\n371\n00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:56.130\nit breaks the seesaw so that's when it\ngets, when I teach this that top point.\n\n372\n00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.555\nI don't make it a straight point,\n\n373\n00:17:58.555 --> 00:18:02.580\nI use that to break it to give\nit a little bit more control.\n\n374\n00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.686\nCuz that where it kinda\ngoes to V that way.\n\n375\n00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:10.772\nSo just another option\nof breaking the see saw,\n\n376\n00:18:10.772 --> 00:18:11.377\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n377\n00:18:11.377 --> 00:18:12.364\n&gt;&gt; For the use of the convert.\n\n378\n00:18:12.364 --> 00:18:14.121\nYou can't do that with\nthe white arrow tool,\n\n379\n00:18:14.121 --> 00:18:15.565\nit has to be the convert anchor tool.\n\n380\n00:18:15.565 --> 00:18:18.522\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that,\nI'm really glad you mentioned that.\n\n381\n00:18:18.522 --> 00:18:20.250\nCuz that's something I always\nthink of with the pen tool.\n\n382\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.758\nFor some reason I'm just Working\nwith the white arrow tool it doesn't\n\n383\n00:18:22.758 --> 00:18:23.403\never occur to me.\n\n384\n00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:26.152\nBut yes if for\nsome reason you need to break that,\n\n385\n00:18:26.152 --> 00:18:28.109\nmy heart looks a little wonky now.\n\n386\n00:18:28.109 --> 00:18:32.383\nYou can use the Anchor Point tool,\nso you do have the option.\n\n387\n00:18:32.383 --> 00:18:35.212\nWe kinda tell you that it's a see saw and\nthat's the only way to go, and it's like,\n\n388\n00:18:35.212 --> 00:18:36.155\nwell, okay, not really.\n\n389\n00:18:36.155 --> 00:18:39.231\nYou do have the option with\nyour Anchor Point tool there.\n\n390\n00:18:39.231 --> 00:18:41.923\nSo, I would say let's go ahead and\nstop there.\n\n391\n00:18:41.923 --> 00:18:45.955\nGive you some time to kinda practice and\nkeep working with this especially,\n\n392\n00:18:45.955 --> 00:18:50.372\nworking with your curved paths since those\nare gonna be a little more challenging.\n\n393\n00:18:50.372 --> 00:18:53.917\nTake your Bezier handles and\nassess how those work and\n\n394\n00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:57.080\nthen we'll come back and do the Pen tool.\n\n395\n00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.265\n&gt;&gt; The pen tool.\n\n396\n00:18:58.265 --> 00:18:58.833\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n397\n00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:01.548\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but I use these all the time.\n\n398\n00:19:01.548 --> 00:19:02.266\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n399\n00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.510\nbecause again you kinda\nstart with something.\n\n400\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.478\nInstead of going right to the pen tool and\ndoing it from scratch,\n\n401\n00:19:09.478 --> 00:19:14.906\na lot of times I can take a square,\nor a circle, and add and subtract and\n\n402\n00:19:14.906 --> 00:19:20.150\nbreak and move and do all these kinds\nof things to end up with a heart or\n\n403\n00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.190\nsome weird shape that I'm going to do.\n\n404\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.451\nBecause I can just go ahead and use those\nand just avoid the pen tool altogether.\n\n405\n00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:29.983\nAnd then a lot of time I'm like\nit's not doing what I wanna do,\n\n406\n00:19:29.983 --> 00:19:32.300\nI'm just gonna go to the pen tool and\ndo it from scratch.\n\n407\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.331\n[LAUGH] But that was a great episode,\ngreat concept,\n\n408\n00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:39.822\ncore concepts of how to\nedit points on a path.\n\n409\n00:19:39.822 --> 00:19:41.007\n&gt;&gt; All right; yehey.\n\n410\n00:19:41.007 --> 00:19:43.765\n&gt;&gt; Fun, so lets go ahead and\nwrap it on up.\n\n411\n00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:45.939\nWe're gonna sign off for CreativePro.TV.\n\n412\n00:19:45.939 --> 00:19:46.968\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n413\n00:19:46.968 --> 00:19:48.291\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n414\n00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:49.046\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n415\n00:19:49.046 --> 00:19:55.054\n[SOUND]\n\n",

to\nanother great edition of CreativeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.050\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and we're\ncontinuing on with IllustratorCC2017 and\n\n5\n00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.320\nthis is the pen tool.\n\n6\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.890\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; You have to sing it.\n\n7\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.198\nYou can't not sing it.\n\n8\n00:00:28.198 --> 00:00:33.570\n&gt;&gt; I know and Miss Emily Ramsey is\nhere to help us with the pen tool and\n\n9\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.980\nI know we're both excited about this tool.\n\n10\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.557\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah well the pen tool.\n\n11\n00:00:37.557 --> 00:00:39.760\nThe pen tool is just always\nthe thing people think of.\n\n12\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.740\nI mean it's like this big dramatic\nmoment when you're finally unveiling it\n\n13\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.100\ncuz it's always what people hear about or\nwe talk about or whatever so.\n\n14\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.840\nI'm excited.\n\n15\n00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.290\nSo what the pen tool does is it's\nbasically just gonna be kind of our\n\n16\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.110\nfreehand.\n\n17\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.420\nI shouldn't say a freehand drawing tool\ncuz that's gonna kinda confuse from\n\n18\n00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.980\nour paint brushes, and things like that.\n\n19\n00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.200\nBut we are going to actually\ndraw with the pen tool.\n\n20\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.280\nSo we're gonna be creating our own paths.\n\n21\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.230\nI can make a closed path,\nopen path, whatever.\n\n22\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.105\n&gt;&gt; And with the pen,\nwe're talking about pinpoint accuracy,\n\n23\n00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n\n24\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.800\n&gt;&gt; Of actually designating when a point\n\n25\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.260\nhappens, what does that point do,\nand how we can kinda move on.\n\n26\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.610\nBecause in referencing the freehand, I'm\njust drawing this in and it goes ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.150\ndetermines where the points are and\nwhat type of points.\n\n28\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.884\nWhether they're curve bezier handles that\nwe saw in the previous episode here.\n\n29\n00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:40.050\nAnd that's actually one\nof those things like,\n\n30\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.922\nif you start with the pencil or\npen tool, wait no, pencil or brush tool.\n\n31\n00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:45.512\n&gt;&gt; Uh-hum.\n&gt;&gt; With that white arrow that we were\n\n32\n00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:48.732\nlooking at before and\nclicked on those points,\n\n33\n00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:53.398\nyou would see the same things that\nwe saw in like the circle or square,\n\n34\n00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:57.040\nwe just weren't ready to\nreally tell you about that.\n\n35\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n36\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.390\n&gt;&gt; And now we're at the point where\n\n37\n00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.730\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nuse the pen tool to do that.\n\n38\n00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n39\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.520\nBut I do think a good place\nto start with our pen tool\n\n40\n00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.850\nis just a quick review\nof our wide area tool.\n\n41\n00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.630\nSo what I've done here, I've just created\na straight path and a curved path.\n\n42\n00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.770\nYou guys know this.\n\n43\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.430\nOkay?\n\n44\n00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.810\nMy straight path is gonna\nbe pretty easy to edit.\n\n45\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.770\nI'll go ahead and grab a point and\nI can kinda manipulate that point so on.\n\n46\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.870\nMy curved paths where things get a little\ncrazy and you have those bezier handles.\n\n47\n00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.310\nWoops, grabbed the whole thing.\n\n48\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.420\nGrab our bezier handles.\n\n49\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.330\nI'm gonna select that point and you can\nsee I can move it down and up fine.\n\n50\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.080\nBut then when I actually move that bezier\nhandle, it's changing In the direction and\n\n51\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.520\nthe amplitude of the curve.\n\n52\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.110\nSo why do I bring this up?\n\n53\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.370\nBecause those same principles\nare gonna apply whether making\n\n54\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.060\na straight path with the pen tool, or\nmaking curved paths with our pen tool, or\n\n55\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.530\ncertainly blending the two together.\n\n56\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.330\nThat's why I wanted to go ahead and\nbring that up.\n\n57\n00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.400\nNow we can go ahead and delete these.\n\n58\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.310\nMy advice with the pen tool,\nevery time, is just one,\n\n59\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.110\nyou may want to sit back and watch\ntoday and just kind of breathe it in.\n\n60\n00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.750\nJust embrace it, relax, enjoy the,\n\n61\n00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.770\nlet the pressure be on me, to go ahead and\ndo it correctly for you on camera I guess.\n\n62\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.930\nSo you can go ahead and do that, or\njust practice, practice, practice.\n\n63\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.690\nWatch me do it once,\nthen go ahead and do it.\n\n64\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.330\nIt's not gonna be something\nthat you pick up in a day.\n\n65\n00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.350\nIt's just not.\n\n66\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.210\nAnd I can say we probably, the both of us,\nit took us a long time to go ahead and\n\n67\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.690\nreally master this because it is so\nprecise.\n\n68\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.480\nWhich is something that we have\nmissed in some of the other tools.\n\n69\n00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.263\n&gt;&gt; And I like how you said, like, the\nlearning by osmosis type of thing [LAUGH].\n\n70\n00:03:30.263 --> 00:03:30.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n71\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.280\n&gt;&gt; Just watch.\n\n72\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.340\nAnd maybe watch it a couple times.\n\n73\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.360\nMaybe even go watch\nsomebody else do it too.\n\n74\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We're not the only experts on this.\n\n75\n00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does take some kind of\n\n76\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.710\nunderstanding the concepts, then doing.\n\n77\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.270\nBecause it can be very frustrating.\n\n78\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.110\nAnd that's the whole duh, duh, duh.\n\n79\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.110\nMy gosh this is a crazy tool.\n\n80\n00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.570\nBut just breathe it in like you said and\ngive it some time and keep practicing.\n\n81\n00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.645\nYou will get it, just don't write it off.\n\n82\n00:04:01.645 --> 00:04:02.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n83\n00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.250\n&gt;&gt; That's my other point.\n\n84\n00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.540\nDon't write it off.\n\n85\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.100\n&gt;&gt; Don't see it and think,\nI'll never be able to do that.\n\n86\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.010\nYou can get it down and\nwe're going to show you how.\n\n87\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.430\nSo, what I want to do I'm gonna\ngo ahead and grab my pen.\n\n88\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.440\nSo we're gonna get really fancy now and\ngo ahead and grab that.\n\n89\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.000\nNow there's one thing\nthat you'll notice here.\n\n90\n00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.350\nI have a fill color and\nnot a stroke color.\n\n91\n00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.560\nThat is a big no-no with\nworking with the Pen tool.\n\n92\n00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.620\nYou could do it.\n\n93\n00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.190\nLife would go on but\nit's really gonna throw you off.\n\n94\n00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.950\nSo what I need to do here,\nI need to go ahead and just flip these.\n\n95\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.240\nSo I'm gonna swap my fill and my stroke,\nit is going to be much, much easier for\n\n96\n00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.540\nyou, trust me, if you're working with\na stroke color and no fill color applied,\n\n97\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.170\nyou see I have that red slash through it\nin there, that's how I have no fill color.\n\n98\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.310\nSo what I'm gonna do, the exact same way\nthat we did with our white arrow tool,\n\n99\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.060\nI'm gonna start with straight paths, so\nI'm just gonna kind of click around.\n\n100\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.570\nYou can see, okay?\n\n101\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.630\nIf I just single click,\nsingle click, single click,\n\n102\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.222\nsingle click, single click,\nI can say that five times fast.\n\n103\n00:04:56.222 --> 00:04:59.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If I just kinda keep going and\n\n104\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.540\nI can even actually close that, and\n\n105\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.310\nI'll show you kind of what that looks like\nin a second, I can kinda make something.\n\n106\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.390\nI don't know what that is,\na weird transformer, something.\n\n107\n00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.270\nBut I can go ahead and\nkinda make something there,\n\n108\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.060\njust by doing single click,\nsingle click and single click.\n\n109\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.900\nNow, you wanna be careful,\ndon't like, click and drag.\n\n110\n00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.320\nJust single click.\n\n111\n00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.595\nYou want to just do a quick little\nclick onto your art board there.\n\n112\n00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:27.410\nNow, you'll say, you'll see that\nI went ahead and closed that and\n\n113\n00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.010\nif you aren't trying to close it or\nsomething, you may have be having a hard\n\n114\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.550\ntime getting away from the pen tool,\nwhich we'll talk about in a second.\n\n115\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.150\nBut I did wanna point out to go ahead and\nclose something so you'll see I have that\n\n116\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.540\nmy pen tool and then my cursor\nturned to kind of, sort of a circle.\n\n117\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.430\nAt the end of it so I have a little tail\non my pen I guess is what I'm trying to\n\n118\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.830\nsay, I can kind of zoom in.\n\n119\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.860\nThat's one of Illustrator's way.\n\n120\n00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.900\nOne of Illustrator's tips\nthat they use to give you to\n\n121\n00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.770\nlet you know that you're gonna go\nahead and close this path out.\n\n122\n00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.360\nSo, I'll go ahead and close it.\n\n123\n00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think that's one thing with\nIllustrator, especially in the pen tool.\n\n124\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.849\nWatch your mouse cursor icon.\n\n125\n00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.789\nAnd it's like yeah, just start click,\nclick, click, click, click.\n\n126\n00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.281\nBut just take notice that\nright now where you're at,\n\n127\n00:06:11.281 --> 00:06:14.084\nyou have a pen with a star, an asterisk\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n128\n00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:16.700\n&gt;&gt; I'll probably say an X cuz\nit used to be an X, okay?.\n\n129\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.272\nThat will always indicate new path,\nyou're starting straight up and\n\n130\n00:06:21.272 --> 00:06:24.925\nwe're gonna go, and\nas soon as you click and then move.\n\n131\n00:06:24.925 --> 00:06:26.360\nYou're not holding the mouse.\n\n132\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.460\nYou see how now your pen has nothing.\n\n133\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.480\nIf you have nothing on that bottom right\nhand corner, then it's continuing on.\n\n134\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.400\nWe're gonna continue,\ncontinue, you're still moving.\n\n135\n00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.920\nHovering over that first\npoint that we started,\n\n136\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.350\nthat's where you're gonna get the circle.\n\n137\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.540\nAnd you're only gonna see the circle if\nyou go back to the point you started at.\n\n138\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.860\nAnd then you can close it.\n\n139\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYou can't just close it randomly.\n\n140\n00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.710\nI can't just close it over here.\n\n141\n00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.170\nYou'll see that turns into a kind of that\nstraight line which is something else,\n\n142\n00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.360\nit's gonna try and pick it up from there.\n\n143\n00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.842\nYou can only close it at that\nalready [CROSSTALK] This one.\n\n144\n00:07:00.842 --> 00:07:02.820\nYeah you're right,\nyou're right, you're right.\n\n145\n00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.230\nAs I was looking at it I was like,\nthat was a little too straight to be.\n\n146\n00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.280\nYeah, yeah you're right.\n\n147\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.150\nThat's going to delete a point, yes.\n\n148\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.360\nThank you.\n\n149\n00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.910\nAnd then likewise when I kind of\nhovered in the middle we had the add\n\n150\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.340\na point, so yeah.\n\n151\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.880\nYeah.\n\n152\n00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.460\n&gt;&gt; I cheated.\n&gt;&gt; Those little things that will just kind\n\n153\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.590\nof give you that indication\nof what's going on.\n\n154\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.230\nBut yeah, click, click,\nclick, click click.\n\n155\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.360\nClick and go, and have fun, because any\ntime you click will make a straight point.\n\n156\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.420\nSo now we're ready to,\nwell I don't know what we're ready to do.\n\n157\n00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.860\n&gt;&gt; We're going to make some v's.\n\n158\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.380\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n\n159\n00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.910\n&gt;&gt; We're going to make some v's for\nVonne, yes.\n\n160\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.020\nSo here's what I wanna do.\n\n161\n00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.349\nI wanna show you a closed v\nversus an open b, v rather.\n\n162\n00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:41.190\nSo we can start talking about making a\nclosed path versus making an open path so.\n\n163\n00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.000\nI'm gonna go ahead here.\n\n164\n00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.380\nI'm gonna do a v that\nkinda looks like this.\n\n165\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.770\nAgain, I'm just single clicking,\njust quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.\n\n166\n00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.268\nAnd then, paying attention to\nthose little cursor icons here,\n\n167\n00:07:52.268 --> 00:07:54.814\nnot gonna be the prettiest\nthing in the world.\n\n168\n00:07:54.814 --> 00:07:59.582\nIt's not quite perfect, and then I'm gonna\ngo ahead and close that out there so\n\n169\n00:07:59.582 --> 00:08:00.877\nI have that closed V.\n\n170\n00:08:00.877 --> 00:08:02.251\nSo we have that, okay?\n\n171\n00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:05.662\nNot perfect, but the beautiful thing\nabout making something with the Pen tool,\n\n172\n00:08:05.662 --> 00:08:08.900\nalways go back to your white arrow\ntool if I wanted to edit this later.\n\n173\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.930\nNow that's our closed path.\n\n174\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.689\nHow do I make an open path?\n\n175\n00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:15.780\nThere are several different\nways to stop an open path.\n\n176\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.158\nSo you're probably noticing, if I'm trying\nto make a V that just looks like this,\n\n177\n00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:21.840\nwhat do I do here?\n\n178\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.659\nHow do I kind of get out of this?\n\n179\n00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:24.460\nSo here's a couple different options.\n\n180\n00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.245\nOne, hold down you Cmd or Ctrl key,\nCmd on a Mac, Ctrl on a PC and\n\n181\n00:08:28.245 --> 00:08:31.410\nthen single click somewhere\nelse on your art board.\n\n182\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.368\nAnd I should note that when\nI say all these things,\n\n183\n00:08:34.368 --> 00:08:38.890\nthese are all tools that will stop an open\npath, but keep you in the Pen tool.\n\n184\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.240\nSo yes, you could have gone\nto your black arrow tool,\n\n185\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.600\nthat would have been an option.\n\n186\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.660\nAnd that always works, but if you wanna\nstay in the Pen tool, like if I wanna go\n\n187\n00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.480\nimmediately into drawing something else,\nthat's the other option that you have.\n\n188\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.570\nNow another one, there are four.\n\n189\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.260\nYou can double-click on\nthe Pen tool itself.\n\n190\n00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.090\nSo if I just double-click on the Pen tool\nitself, that's gonna stop my open path,\n\n191\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.230\nbut then it's also going\nto keep me in the Pen tool.\n\n192\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.580\nSo another option that I have.\n\n193\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.920\nThat was two, we have one, was to Cmd or\nCtrl+click somewhere else.\n\n194\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.960\nTwo was double-click on the Pen tool.\n\n195\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.050\nThree is going to, I'm gonna make this V,\n\n196\n00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.330\nand then I'm gonna use\nthe Esc key on my keyboard.\n\n197\n00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.590\nSo if I go ahead and hit Esc that\nwill go ahead, close my path or\n\n198\n00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.210\nkeep me in the Pen tool.\n\n199\n00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.160\nLast one, so we had overview again.\n\n200\n00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.690\nSo our last one here,\nwe're gonna make our V.\n\n201\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.580\nAnd then what are we gonna do?\n\n202\n00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.020\nWe are gonna go ahead and hit the Enter\nkey on our keyboard or Return, whatever.\n\n203\n00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:36.906\nEnter will go ahead and stop the path,\nkeep you in the Pen tool.\n\n204\n00:09:36.906 --> 00:09:40.730\nSo Cmd or Ctrl+click somewhere else,\ndouble-click on the Pen tool,\n\n205\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.850\nhit the Esc key, or\nhit the Enter key on your keyboard, and\n\n206\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.590\nthat will all stop an open path.\n\n207\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.732\n&gt;&gt; I forgot about the Enter one.\n\n208\n00:09:47.732 --> 00:09:48.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n209\n00:09:48.582 --> 00:09:55.126\n&gt;&gt; So I'm holding it and wait, I thought\nEsc, right, Enter, yep, that's a good one.\n\n210\n00:09:55.126 --> 00:09:55.830\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n211\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.311\n&gt;&gt; And it really is just your own\n\n212\n00:09:57.311 --> 00:09:59.610\npersonal preference, what you wanna use.\n\n213\n00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.194\nLike for me, I would never\ndouble-click on the Pen tool.\n\n214\n00:10:02.194 --> 00:10:02.995\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like-\n\n215\n00:10:02.995 --> 00:10:04.269\n&gt;&gt; And I had forgotten about that one,\n\n216\n00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:06.296\ntoo, and I was like, where did she go?\n\n217\n00:10:06.296 --> 00:10:06.981\nYeah.\n\n218\n00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.140\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, that's a kind of longer one.\n\n219\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwhy would you go back there if that's kind\n\n220\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.253\nof like going to the black arrow tool?\n\n221\n00:10:14.253 --> 00:10:16.293\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and when you do the Ctrl, and\n\n222\n00:10:16.293 --> 00:10:19.470\nthis kinda correlates into\nother Adobe products.\n\n223\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.521\nWhen you hold the Ctrl, or Cmd if\nyou're on the Mac, it always toggles\n\n224\n00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:30.015\nto a selection tool or toggles to your\nMove tool or something to that effect.\n\n225\n00:10:30.015 --> 00:10:34.991\nSo that's really a toggle in itself,\nbut in this instance, since we're in\n\n226\n00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:39.812\nthe Pen tool, holding down that Cmd or\nCtrl key will temporarily access,\n\n227\n00:10:39.812 --> 00:10:43.580\nI think it was the white arrow tool,\nis what it accessed.\n\n228\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, what it did access, yes.\n\n229\n00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:48.089\n&gt;&gt; And then you click off into nowhere,\nto where you're saying stop,\n\n230\n00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:51.320\nlet go of the Ctrl, and\nthen you're still back in the Pen tool.\n\n231\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.790\nSo that correlates over other places.\n\n232\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.710\nJust in case you were\nwondering about that.\n\n233\n00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.398\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know the type tool, that's\na big one, things like that, so yeah,\n\n234\n00:10:58.398 --> 00:10:58.987\nyou can go here.\n\n235\n00:10:58.987 --> 00:11:03.973\nIf I hold down my Cmd or Ctrl key, I'm on\na Mac so I'm using Cmd, I can go ahead and\n\n236\n00:11:03.973 --> 00:11:06.076\ntoggle to the white arrow tool.\n\n237\n00:11:06.076 --> 00:11:06.715\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then you can move that.\n\n238\n00:11:06.715 --> 00:11:09.940\n&gt;&gt; And then you can move it,\nyeah, if you did the wrong spot.\n\n239\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.159\nYou have all of those\noptions available to you.\n\n240\n00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:16.800\nNow how do I, let's say, for\ninstance, I'm making this V,\n\n241\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.260\nand then I add an extra little point here.\n\n242\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.057\nAnd I'm like ooh, whoops,\nI didn't mean to go ahead and do that.\n\n243\n00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:24.100\nTwo different options that you have.\n\n244\n00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.379\nIf you want to remove this extra point,\nI've got this little guy here.\n\n245\n00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:29.787\nI've already committed.\n\n246\n00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:30.425\nI've already made it.\n\n247\n00:11:30.425 --> 00:11:32.950\nHow do I remove a point and stop the path?\n\n248\n00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.992\nIn that case, you're gonna hit\nthe Delete key on your keyboard.\n\n249\n00:11:34.992 --> 00:11:36.700\nSo we, we go ahead and delete.\n\n250\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.736\nThat will remove that extra point that\nyou added, but then stop the path and\n\n251\n00:11:40.736 --> 00:11:42.160\nthen just give you that V.\n\n252\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.780\nNow say I'm in a situation where\nI'm doing this, and it's like,\n\n253\n00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.810\nwhoops, I've added a point,\nand I really wanna keep going.\n\n254\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.320\nI don't wanna stop my path, but\nI just wanna go somewhere else.\n\n255\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.850\nLike maybe I meant to go up here.\n\n256\n00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.680\nThat's just gonna be your typical Undo, so\n\n257\n00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.460\nCmd or Ctrl-Z, as in zebra,\nwill go ahead and\n\n258\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.230\nlet you be like, okay, I just wanted to go\nover here, or whatever you wanted to do.\n\n259\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.820\nSo those are your two options.\n\n260\n00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.680\nTo stop an open path with an extra point\nthat you've created, hit the Delete key.\n\n261\n00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.720\nIf you wanna keep going,\nyou wanna hit that Cmd or Ctrl+Z.\n\n262\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.980\nSo with that, that's pretty much\nyour straight paths in a nutshell.\n\n263\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.070\nThose are going to be the ones that\nare a little bit more straightforward,\n\n264\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.320\nno pun intended.\n\n265\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.970\nIt's the curved paths and those Bezier\nhandles were things are gonna get fancy.\n\n266\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.920\nNow the thing that you always wanna think\nabout with your Bezier handles is knowing\n\n267\n00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.450\nwhere you wanna go next.\n\n268\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.660\nYou kinda have to set yourself up for\nsuccess with the Bezier handles.\n\n269\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.420\nSo when you are creating a point\noriginally, we're gonna click, hold and\n\n270\n00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.110\ndrag now so\nwe create those Bezier handles.\n\n271\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.540\nWhen I'm creating the point,\nI need to think about,\n\n272\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.740\nokay, where do I want my curve to go?\n\n273\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.060\nSo what we're gonna do,\n\n274\n00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.180\nwe are gonna create something\nthat looks basically like this,\n\n275\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.130\nkind of a more precise version of that,\njust as an introduction to our curve.\n\n276\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.570\nSo what we're gonna do, grab my Pen tool.\n\n277\n00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.417\nFirst thing, I'm gonna click,\nhold, and drag up,\n\n278\n00:13:00.417 --> 00:13:02.453\nbecause I want a little curve to go up.\n\n279\n00:13:02.453 --> 00:13:06.697\nI click hold and drag up, then I'm gonna\nkind of find a point along that same line,\n\n280\n00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:11.020\nclick hold and drag down, you see\nnow that I have that little bump up.\n\n281\n00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.216\nIf I go back along that same line,\nI'm looking at my points,\n\n282\n00:13:13.216 --> 00:13:14.650\nI'm not looking at my Bezier handles.\n\n283\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.593\nDon't get confused by your handles.\n\n284\n00:13:16.593 --> 00:13:18.830\nLook at the actual points themselves.\n\n285\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.510\nIf I click, hold and drag up,\nI can go ahead and go there.\n\n286\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.660\nClick, hold and drag down,\nand just keep going back and\n\n287\n00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.090\nforth as you continue this pattern,\nyour gonna get that.\n\n288\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.255\nSo again, the key thing here, one,\nknowing where you wanna go next.\n\n289\n00:13:33.255 --> 00:13:37.043\nTwo, knowing you can always edit with your\nwhite air tool later if you're really\n\n290\n00:13:37.043 --> 00:13:38.305\nmessing it up.\n\n291\n00:13:38.305 --> 00:13:41.732\nAnd then three, making sure that you're\npaying attention to where the points are,\n\n292\n00:13:41.732 --> 00:13:44.531\nnot getting confused in trying to\nclick one of those Bezier handles or\n\n293\n00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:45.465\nsomething like that.\n\n294\n00:13:45.465 --> 00:13:50.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I always think about it\nas okay, so this is my first point.\n\n295\n00:13:50.045 --> 00:13:54.408\nWhen you started, how do I want\nthe path to leave this point?\n\n296\n00:13:54.408 --> 00:13:59.202\nI need it to leave going up cuz\nI know on that second point it's\n\n297\n00:13:59.202 --> 00:14:01.930\ngoing to come through going down.\n\n298\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:06.694\nSo that's why you click, hold,\ndrag up, next point click, hold,\n\n299\n00:14:06.694 --> 00:14:09.580\ndrag down, and then it bends in between.\n\n300\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.890\nAnd there is something I wanted to\npoint out on this particular one.\n\n301\n00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.610\nDid you see that kind of ghosting,\nif you wanna see, in between the points?\n\n302\n00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.236\nThat's a newer feature that\nyou didn't have a while ago.\n\n303\n00:14:19.236 --> 00:14:21.697\nAnd I know this is in the Preferences.\n\n304\n00:14:21.697 --> 00:14:23.517\nOr at least I think I remember\nit's in the Preferences.\n\n305\n00:14:23.517 --> 00:14:29.225\nI will say for me as an old school person,\nthis kind of preview,\n\n306\n00:14:29.225 --> 00:14:33.620\nit honestly throws me off\nmore than it helps me.\n\n307\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.910\n&gt;&gt; Really, is it under Smart Guide?\n\n308\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.550\nIs that what I'm thinking?\n\n309\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.300\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember.\n\n310\n00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.270\nIt's somewhere in there.\n\n311\n00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.590\n&gt;&gt; We'll figure it out.\n&gt;&gt; We'll let you know.\n\n312\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:42.462\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n\n313\n00:14:42.462 --> 00:14:43.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like it, personally.\n\n314\n00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:45.661\nI mean,\nI would never want to take it off, and\n\n315\n00:14:45.661 --> 00:14:48.161\nthat's probably why I would\nnever have looked it up, yeah.\n\n316\n00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:49.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I'm like,\n\n317\n00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:50.757\nwhy is it doing this?\n\n318\n00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:55.431\nI know it's being helpful, and for\nsomebody learning, that's great and\n\n319\n00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:59.600\nI think I came around to it, but\nI was like I'm gonna turn this off.\n\n320\n00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.980\nAnd I did find it somewhere in\nthe Preferences, so I will-\n\n321\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.558\n&gt;&gt; Very bold woman, turn it off!\n\n322\n00:15:04.558 --> 00:15:05.370\nLike wow!\n\n323\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.224\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't need to see where\n\n324\n00:15:07.224 --> 00:15:09.748\nyou're going, just draw anywhere!\n\n325\n00:15:09.748 --> 00:15:13.978\n&gt;&gt; I didn't, [LAUGH] bold is just old.\n\n326\n00:15:13.978 --> 00:15:17.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was like, no, no, no, no.\n\n327\n00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.023\nYou're not,\nyou're just experienced in Illustrator.\n\n328\n00:15:21.023 --> 00:15:21.528\nWe'll say that.\n\n329\n00:15:21.528 --> 00:15:24.830\nSo yeah, we'll go ahead and\ndo that again, just to run through it.\n\n330\n00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.730\nI'm gonna start here, start fresh.\n\n331\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:33.430\nClick, hold, and drag up, you'll see that\nmy path, the Bezier handle's going up.\n\n332\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.080\nI'm also seeing that ghosting\nthat Vonne pointed out.\n\n333\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.020\nSo now I've seen my little hump going up.\n\n334\n00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.655\nIf you wanna get really fancy,\nyou'll see how when you're drawing these,\n\n335\n00:15:42.655 --> 00:15:47.448\nsee how your Bezier handles can kinda go\na little bit wonky on you if you want to?\n\n336\n00:15:47.448 --> 00:15:49.576\nThey can kinda start\nto create some angles,\n\n337\n00:15:49.576 --> 00:15:52.287\nwhich is gonna affect the kinda\ndirection of your hump.\n\n338\n00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:56.026\nWhat I tend to do I hold down my\nshift key just like anything else,\n\n339\n00:15:56.026 --> 00:15:58.870\nmaintaining those perfect proportions.\n\n340\n00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.888\nAnd that will kind of keep your bezier\nhandler from going left and right.\n\n341\n00:16:01.888 --> 00:16:05.159\nIt's gonna keep it at a perfect 90\ndegree angle, so you can go ahead and\n\n342\n00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:06.788\nuse that as an option if you want to.\n\n343\n00:16:06.788 --> 00:16:09.258\nBut, click hold, I'm gonna let it go.\n\n344\n00:16:09.258 --> 00:16:12.160\nThat's kind of always the key thing too,\nI think, with the pen tools.\n\n345\n00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.530\nKnowing when to let go.\n\n346\n00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.640\nSo I'm gonna click, hold, and drag.\n\n347\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.170\nNow I've let go of my mouse.\n\n348\n00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.180\nGo back up here, click,\nhold, drag, let go.\n\n349\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.200\nClick, hold, drag, let go.\n\n350\n00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.460\nSo that's really kinda\nkeep doing that until you\n\n351\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.620\nfeel like you get comfortable with it.\n\n352\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.802\nOnce you feel like you get\ncomfortable with that,\n\n353\n00:16:33.802 --> 00:16:35.880\nwe're gonna mix it up a little bit more.\n\n354\n00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.960\nNow we're gonna talk\nabout changing direction.\n\n355\n00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.650\nSo what do I do if I\nwant to create something.\n\n356\n00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.030\nThat was a terrible drawing.\n\n357\n00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.050\nBut what do I do if I want to create\nsomething that looks like that?\n\n358\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.055\nIn that case,\nwe need to work on our corner points.\n\n359\n00:16:48.055 --> 00:16:50.760\nSo we kind of go back to\nthose bezier handles.\n\n360\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:56.130\nIt's like, wait a second, if I did this\nthen by default, it wants to go to down.\n\n361\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.220\nWhat do I do?\n\n362\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.970\nYou remember working with\nthat anchor point tool,\n\n363\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.530\nback when we discussed the white arrow?\n\n364\n00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.720\nThis is gonna be kind of similar,\nit's really using that.\n\n365\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.990\nSo if I take my pen tool here,\nclick, hold, and drag up.\n\n366\n00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.300\nClick hold and drag down, so\nI'm gonna started the exact same way.\n\n367\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.175\nNow, I've let go of my mouse.\n\n368\n00:17:15.175 --> 00:17:17.020\nYou can see my jazz hands here.\n\n369\n00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.560\nSo I've let go of my mouse and\nI'm gonna hold down my Alt or Option key.\n\n370\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.700\nOption on a Mac.\n\n371\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.375\nAlt on a PC.\n\n372\n00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.015\nI'm gonna hold that down and\nyou're gonna see it's gonna\n\n373\n00:17:25.015 --> 00:17:29.655\ntoggle to that anchor point tool,\nso I get that little v coming up.\n\n374\n00:17:29.655 --> 00:17:32.595\nSo I can see that Alt, I can go ahead and\nclick, hold, and drag.\n\n375\n00:17:32.595 --> 00:17:34.765\nNow I'm just gonna drag\nthis little bezier handle,\n\n376\n00:17:34.765 --> 00:17:36.030\nI'm not messing with the point now.\n\n377\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.220\nI'm actually using the bezier handle, and\n\n378\n00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.180\nI'm just gonna drag it\nup to meet its friend.\n\n379\n00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.130\nSo I'm just placing the two right on\ntop of each other, is what I'm doing.\n\n380\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.190\nAnd then I am gonna let go of my mouse,\nso now I've moved that bezier handle up.\n\n381\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.293\nI've created a corner point\nto go ahead and meet that.\n\n382\n00:17:51.293 --> 00:17:53.173\nNow, I'm gonna let go.\n\n383\n00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:57.417\nJazz hands, and I'm going to kind of\ncreate a point again, along the same line.\n\n384\n00:17:57.417 --> 00:18:00.797\nSimilar to what we were doing before,\nwhere you were doing the up and down,\n\n385\n00:18:00.797 --> 00:18:04.770\nup and down, except for now, I'm just\nadjusting where my curves are going.\n\n386\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.350\nSo I've let go of my mouse again.\n\n387\n00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:11.762\nI'm going to click and hold on my Alt or\nOption key, click, hold, and drag that up.\n\n388\n00:18:11.762 --> 00:18:14.510\nI'm gonna drag this little\nguy to meet its friend.\n\n389\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.780\nJust place the two right on top\nof each other or close to it.\n\n390\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.270\nClick, hold, and drag, create a new one.\n\n391\n00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.280\nLet go.\nAlt or Option key.\n\n392\n00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.888\nClick, hold, and drag that up.\n\n393\n00:18:26.888 --> 00:18:27.552\nLet go.\n\n394\n00:18:27.552 --> 00:18:28.920\nI've let go again.\n\n395\n00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.850\nThat's the key one there.\n\n396\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.020\nClick, hold, and drag.\n\n397\n00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.940\nAnd now I can see be like\nthese aren't perfect.\n\n398\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.130\nIt's not great, but\nI can go back to my white arrow tool.\n\n399\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.800\n&gt;&gt; In this it goes back to how\nis the point leaving the path.\n\n400\n00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:46.900\nHow is it going into, like thinking ahead,\npoint one to two, okay, up, down.\n\n401\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:51.820\nBut now I have to think point two to point\nthree, well, it's gotta turn around.\n\n402\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:57.224\nIt's gotta leave point two going back up,\nso I had to break that direction.\n\n403\n00:18:57.224 --> 00:19:01.900\nIt's not just like a flowing,\nit's stop, turn around.\n\n404\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.893\nJust like if you went into a corner,\nI turned around looked at the wall.\n\n405\n00:19:05.893 --> 00:19:07.952\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; If you go into a corner,\n\n406\n00:19:07.952 --> 00:19:10.899\nthe only other option is to turn\naround and go out the other way.\n\n407\n00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:15.727\nSo that's the whole idea of why we\ncalled it a corner point is cuz it is\n\n408\n00:19:15.727 --> 00:19:18.200\nchanging the direction in there.\n\n409\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.540\nAnd like you said, white arrow tool,\nyou always get it started.\n\n410\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.430\nDon't worry about getting it exact.\n\n411\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.409\nYeah, we can talk about things\nwhen we do the aligns, and\n\n412\n00:19:26.409 --> 00:19:28.283\nthe grades, and things like that.\n\n413\n00:19:28.283 --> 00:19:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, measure tool will come in handy.\n\n414\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah all that.\n\n415\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.440\nBut it's really just get it in there.\n\n416\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.026\nUse the white arrow and go back to\nit because that's what I always do.\n\n417\n00:19:36.026 --> 00:19:37.062\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nGet it down,\n\n418\n00:19:37.062 --> 00:19:39.920\nedit it out, and then move along.\n\n419\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.549\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and then just be like\nokay that's close enough, right?\n\n420\n00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:43.500\n[LAUGH].\n\n421\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.300\nSo we're gonna go ahead here.\n\n422\n00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.400\nI want to show one last example.\n\n423\n00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.666\nJust to show you kind of what you\ncan do with those corner points.\n\n424\n00:19:51.666 --> 00:19:54.424\nBasically, what am I going to do if\nI want to mix straight paths and\n\n425\n00:19:54.424 --> 00:19:55.465\ncurved paths, right?\n\n426\n00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:57.620\nOkay, so you're not always going\nto have the exact same thing.\n\n427\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.970\nSo, what I'm going to do, I'm just\ngonna kind of blend the two together.\n\n428\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.346\nSo, I'm gonna click, hold,\nand drag up, let go.\n\n429\n00:20:03.346 --> 00:20:05.420\nClick, hold, drag down, let go.\n\n430\n00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.750\nClick, hold, drag up, let go.\n\n431\n00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.400\nNow, it's like, okay, maybe now I'll make\na corner point or something similar to it.\n\n432\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.610\nSo I've let go of my mouse, jazz hands.\n\n433\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.561\nNever thought I'd say jazz hands so\nmuch when I came here today.\n\n434\n00:20:16.561 --> 00:20:17.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I can go ahead.\n\n435\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.360\nI'm gonna hold down the ALT or OPTION key\nand then now, rather than dragging this\n\n436\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.970\ndown to meet its friend to create another\nhub going down, what I'm gonna do,\n\n437\n00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.480\nI'm gonna remember that principle of\nalways knowing where I wanna go next.\n\n438\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.160\nAnd maybe now I just wanna\nhave a straight line.\n\n439\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.980\nSo I'm gonna drag that\nhandlebar that way and\n\n440\n00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.786\nyou see now it's pointing\nat a 90 degree angle.\n\n441\n00:20:34.786 --> 00:20:35.509\nSo you'd note,\n\n442\n00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:40.100\nyou're not just limited to just corners,\njust know where you want to go next.\n\n443\n00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:46.010\n&gt;&gt; And this is another one where a lot of\npeople want to take that bezier handle and\n\n444\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.800\ndrag it out, because it kind of\nlooks like a ball at the end, and\n\n445\n00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.160\nthat's where I want my next point.\n\n446\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.310\nNo, you just send it in the direction.\n\n447\n00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.720\nCuz that's what this is doing.\n\n448\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.490\nIt's just a directional signal,\nif you wanna say.\n\n449\n00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:04.640\nIt's when you made that next point that\nit's gonna connect straight across.\n\n450\n00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.940\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, exactly.\n\n451\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.580\nSo I've got that straight, okay,\n\n452\n00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.704\nI knew that that bezier handle needed\nto be going in that direction.\n\n453\n00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:11.920\nSo that's what I wanted to work with.\n\n454\n00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.430\nNow I have a straight path, but\nI don't have a Bezier handle.\n\n455\n00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.230\nHow can I kind of create\nsomething curved out of this?\n\n456\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.969\nAll you have to do,\nyou just kind of select,\n\n457\n00:21:20.969 --> 00:21:25.355\nsee if I hover over my point there,\nwhat I'll see is I get that anchor.\n\n458\n00:21:25.355 --> 00:21:30.633\nOr I'm sorry, the pen tool with sort\nof like a mini anchor point tool,\n\n459\n00:21:30.633 --> 00:21:32.880\nkind of had there as the tail.\n\n460\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.579\nSo you get the pen tool with\nthe little v next to it basically.\n\n461\n00:21:35.579 --> 00:21:40.015\nAnd what you can do is from there when\nI see that I can just click, hold, and\n\n462\n00:21:40.015 --> 00:21:40.598\ndrag up.\n\n463\n00:21:40.598 --> 00:21:42.780\nAnd that's gonna give me\na bezier handle to work with.\n\n464\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.820\nSo now, I can make that a curve again and\n\n465\n00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.810\nI can go back and\nmaybe now I want to go in this way.\n\n466\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.720\nSo I'll do that again,\nclick, hold, and drag down.\n\n467\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.932\nOops, got that one a little messed up.\n\n468\n00:21:55.932 --> 00:21:58.680\nThat's okay, we'll start over.\n\n469\n00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.350\nI got myself all wonky here.\n\n470\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.300\nI'm just gonna start over.\n\n471\n00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:02.930\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n472\n00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.270\n&gt;&gt; We can always adjust\n\n473\n00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.080\nwith the white arrow tool later, right?\n\n474\n00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.580\nSo we can go to that,\nclick, hold and drag.\n\n475\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.550\nMaybe now I wanna go straight here.\n\n476\n00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:18.862\nDo whatever you need to do to be\nable to adjust things as you need.\n\n477\n00:22:18.862 --> 00:22:20.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now-\n&gt;&gt; I just had to prove to myself that I\n\n478\n00:22:20.835 --> 00:22:21.500\ncould do that.\n\n479\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.449\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] was not working for me.\n\n480\n00:22:22.449 --> 00:22:25.829\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As you're demonstrating, practice,\n\n481\n00:22:25.829 --> 00:22:26.820\nkeep on going.\n\n482\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.560\nJust hey,\njust know that you can go back and edit.\n\n483\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.580\nCuz we know we have our add and delete.\n\n484\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.030\nWe have our convert,\nanchor point tool to go back and\n\n485\n00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.150\nbreak the Bézier handles and everything.\n\n486\n00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.950\nGet it down and\nthen you can edit it later.\n\n487\n00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.445\nAnd as a little other side note,\nthat previewing,\n\n488\n00:22:45.445 --> 00:22:49.048\nit's called the Rubber Band Preview.\n\n489\n00:22:49.048 --> 00:22:51.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I kind of like that name, yeah.\n\n490\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:58.890\n&gt;&gt; And it is in the Preferences, and\nin the Select and Anchor Display tab.\n\n491\n00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.609\nSo that's where we need to go.\n\n492\n00:23:00.609 --> 00:23:01.979\nYup, there you go.\n\n493\n00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:03.882\n&gt;&gt; Selection and Anchor Display.\n\n494\n00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:06.863\n&gt;&gt; And then it should be a rubber band,\nsomething rubber band.\n\n495\n00:23:06.863 --> 00:23:09.921\n&gt;&gt; Yup, enable rubber band for\nthe pen tool and the curvature tool.\n\n496\n00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:10.697\nThe curvature tool's fun.\n\n497\n00:23:10.697 --> 00:23:12.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n498\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.378\nIf you're not loving the pen tool,\nyou're gonna like the curvature tool.\n\n499\n00:23:15.378 --> 00:23:15.952\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yea.\n\n500\n00:23:15.952 --> 00:23:16.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just to\n\n501\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.780\ncomplete that thought of me saying\nI don't like that preview thing.\n\n502\n00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.070\nIt's called the rubber band and\nyou can turn it off.\n\n503\n00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.305\nAnd if you wanna be old and bold like me.\n\n504\n00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:30.828\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was gonna say,\nI'm like, I'm not turning it off.\n\n505\n00:23:30.828 --> 00:23:33.133\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna close that back down,\n\n506\n00:23:33.133 --> 00:23:34.590\nforget I ever saw it.\n\n507\n00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.272\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Bad self, I'll be over\nhere making it easier for myself.\n\n508\n00:23:38.272 --> 00:23:40.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you have a pen tool.\n\n509\n00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.220\nI would say, we would both agree, just\npractice, that's all it comes down to.\n\n510\n00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.150\nYou're gonna screw it up.\n\n511\n00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.340\nJust like I did here.\n\n512\n00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.610\nYou saw, it's even still now I've\nbeen using this for years and\n\n513\n00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.320\nit's still kind of can\ntrip you up sometimes.\n\n514\n00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.190\nSo just remember practice.\n\n515\n00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:55.340\nYou can always go back.\n\n516\n00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.970\nJust kind of get where you're going,\nstart it.\n\n517\n00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.490\nYou can always go back and\nedit and fix things later.\n\n518\n00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.703\n&gt;&gt; Well I thought that\nwas quite enjoyable.\n\n519\n00:24:01.703 --> 00:24:03.161\n[LAUGH] I loved that episode.\n\n520\n00:24:03.161 --> 00:24:04.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're like it's so fun.\n\n521\n00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.158\nI can just sit back and watch.\n\n522\n00:24:06.158 --> 00:24:07.554\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n[LAUGH] I'm over here,\n\n523\n00:24:07.554 --> 00:24:10.840\neverything she's saying I'm like,\nyep, that's how I would say it.\n\n524\n00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.038\nThat's how I would say it too.\n\n525\n00:24:12.038 --> 00:24:14.588\nLike here, let me jump in and\ngive you my two cents too.\n\n526\n00:24:14.588 --> 00:24:21.100\nSo it's kind of fun as like as your former\nteacher as well way back in the day.\n\n527\n00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.116\nIt was just like one of those, aw,\nI'm having a proud moment right now.\n\n528\n00:24:25.116 --> 00:24:28.801\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I feel like wax on and\nwax off, whatever that, you know.\n\n529\n00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:31.342\n[LAUGH] The student becomes the master or\nwhatever.\n\n530\n00:24:31.342 --> 00:24:34.654\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay now if we keep talking\nabout this I'm gonna start start crying.\n\n531\n00:24:34.654 --> 00:24:35.953\nSo we should probably stop.\n\n532\n00:24:35.953 --> 00:24:38.190\nAll right lets go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n533\n00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.830\nSigning off for Creative Pro TV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith\n\n534\n00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:42.923\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey\n\n535\n00:24:42.923 --> 00:24:43.758\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n536\n00:24:43.758

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And here to help\n\n8\n00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:28.654\nus with all the funness\nis Miss Emily Ramsey.\n\n9\n00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:29.820\nHi.\n&gt;&gt; Hi funness.\n\n10\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:31.294\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if\n\n12\n00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:35.020\nanyone's ever referred to me in that way,\nthat I bring the fun, but yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.830\nI'm glad, I'm glad I can for you.\n\n14\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.620\nSo yes, the curvature Ttool.\n\n15\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.280\nCurvature tool, super fun, basically why?\n\n16\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.900\nBecause if you hated creating curves\nin the pen tool, if you didn't\n\n17\n00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.630\nlike those bezier handles, the curvature\ntool is gonna be your friend.\n\n18\n00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.044\nIt's basically Illustrator's answer that\nthey've come up with in the past couple\n\n19\n00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:55.630\nof years for people who've been like,\n\n20\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.917\nI just can't figure out these bezier\nhandles, and it doesn't make sense to me.\n\n21\n00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:02.270\nIt's kind of like\na cousin of the pen tool.\n\n22\n00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.220\nIt's going to work in\nsomewhat of a similar method.\n\n23\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.690\nYou'll even see that the cursors,\nthe icons look pretty similar, but\n\n24\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.740\nit's just gonna be one,\n\n25\n00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.670\na little bit easier [LAUGH] and two,\nnot quite as precise as the pen tool.\n\n26\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.250\nSo you do kinda have that to balance with,\nbut I just think it's kinda fun.\n\n27\n00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.210\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\ngrab my curvature tool.\n\n28\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.050\nSame thing when we use our pen tool,\n\n29\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.990\nI wanna make sure that I have no fill\nselected and that I have a stroke applied.\n\n30\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.140\nSo I'm just doing the same thing,\nI've got that slash through there, and\n\n31\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.010\nthen I have just my bright friend\norange that we're working with here.\n\n32\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.610\nAnd with the curvature tool I'd say\nlet's just go ahead and click around.\n\n33\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.962\nSo I'm just gonna click up down,\nup down, up down, up down.\n\n34\n00:01:45.962 --> 00:01:49.202\nAnd you'll see rather than working\nwith those bezier handles,\n\n35\n00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:52.310\nI'm not really thinking about\nwhere I need to go next.\n\n36\n00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.900\nI'm kind of just creating curves\nwherever I went ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.790\nclicked down on the page there.\n\n38\n00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.926\nAnd then you'll see that, what I just\nstarted was called the rubber band.\n\n39\n00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:05.720\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n40\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.582\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes you'll see how that will kind\nof guide you to where you're going next.\n\n41\n00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:15.013\nSo, you can see the difference if you\nthink back to that pen tool example when\n\n42\n00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:17.760\nwe did the up and down,\nthe up and down and up and down.\n\n43\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.100\nIt was much more precise.\n\n44\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.100\nNow we can add to this and\n\n45\n00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.870\nwe can certainly make it look a little bit\nmore precise than what I'm doing here.\n\n46\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.410\nBut you see it's kind\nof a different effect.\n\n47\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well, and I honestly had\nkind of forgotten about this tool.\n\n48\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.710\nAnd as soon as you started, I was,\nthis is that wonderful kind of\n\n49\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.400\nmarriage between the pen tool,\nwhich you're clicking, you're almost,\n\n50\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.260\nlike moving your mouse around and\nwhere you're clicking the points and\n\n51\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.180\nletting Illustrator do all\nthe hard work in between.\n\n52\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.391\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is one I'd definitely not turn\n\n53\n00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:53.416\noff the rubber band preview because\notherwise I wouldn't have any idea what's\n\n54\n00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:54.208\ngoing on here.\n\n55\n00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:57.702\n&gt;&gt; Right, you do, I do find it to be\npretty necessary that you have that rubber\n\n56\n00:02:57.702 --> 00:03:00.540\nband preview on,\nespecially as you're getting used to it.\n\n57\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.910\nNow I will say, kinda to your point\nbeing accustomed to bézier handles.\n\n58\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.500\nWhen I first started using this,\n\n59\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.640\nthe curvature tool didn't exist,\nback in the day.\n\n60\n00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.182\nAnd so it kinda took me\na while to kinda get situated.\n\n61\n00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:15.302\nNow, this may be the way you're starting,\n\n62\n00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:19.410\nyou may be like great, glad I didn't\nhave to go through those times.\n\n63\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.800\nAnd so\nwhat I would just suggest to you again,\n\n64\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.050\nmake sure you have that kind of rubber\nband turned on, we talked about.\n\n65\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.120\nIt's available in your Preferences if you\ndidn't watch the episode where we were\n\n66\n00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.290\ntalking about the pen tool.\n\n67\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.230\nIllustrator &gt; Preferences &gt; Selection and\nAnchor Display.\n\n68\n00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.890\nI just see all the way to the bottom\nthat enable rubber band [INAUDIBLE].\n\n69\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.670\nMake sure you have it turned on for\nthe curvature tool.\n\n70\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.750\nAnd that's gonna give you that kind of\nline that tells you where you are going.\n\n71\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.700\nBut one of the wonderful things\nabout the curvature tool\n\n72\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.950\nis that I can edit within this tool.\n\n73\n00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.880\nSo if I save and [INAUDIBLE], if I say\nyou know what, I don't really like that.\n\n74\n00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.027\nI can just go over here, move that around.\n\n75\n00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:02.158\nYou'll see as I'm hovering over the path\nI also get that little plus sign,\n\n76\n00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.340\nyou guys are kind of\nfamiliar with that now.\n\n77\n00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.230\nKind of that add anchor point,\nbasically the same thing.\n\n78\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.400\nI'm getting that plus sign,\nI can go ahead and add something there.\n\n79\n00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.370\nAnd I can be like, you know what,\n\n80\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.170\nI want this to look a little bit more,\nkinda like that.\n\n81\n00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.340\nYou see how that kind of converts\nit to more of that style.\n\n82\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.670\nFrom the episode with the pen tool,\nwe had those kind of perfect curves.\n\n83\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.200\nYou can see how it's like,\nokay I can kinda go ahead and use this and\n\n84\n00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.350\nmake something.\n\n85\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.370\nMaybe I'll add some points here.\n\n86\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.454\nDo what you need to do.\n\n87\n00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:32.802\nYadda yadda yadda.\n\n88\n00:04:32.802 --> 00:04:36.295\nAnd then you can start creating some\nlittle bumps that start to look a little\n\n89\n00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:38.480\nbit more similar to what you're doing.\n\n90\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.090\nAnd just so nice that you can edit.\n\n91\n00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.170\n&gt;&gt; And you're still going.\n\n92\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.530\nLike you haven't stopped your pad.\n\n93\n00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.860\nLike if you move your mouse, you can\nkeep on curving around and do whatever.\n\n94\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.865\nOoh.\n\n95\n00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:50.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.790\nNow the one thing that I find kind of\nannoying is that it constantly wants you\n\n97\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.610\nto close.\n\n98\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.560\nSo no matter what I'm doing,\neven though I'm kind of in an edit mode,\n\n99\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.440\nI always have that little rubber band as\nmuch as I've been talking about how great\n\n100\n00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.820\nthe rubber band is, sometimes it does\nkind of feel like it gets in my way.\n\n101\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.580\nSo that's the only little downside to\nthat, at least for me cuz it's like\n\n102\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.340\nsometimes I'll be over here and\nit's like no I just wanna edit that one.\n\n103\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.830\nI didn't want to close it,\n\n104\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.560\nwhich Illustrator's pretty good about\nbeing able to tell the difference there.\n\n105\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.400\nBut that is something that you\nwant to maybe pay attention to,\n\n106\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.350\nhopefully it won't annoy\nyou like it does me.\n\n107\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.660\nNow you maybe like okay\nwell this is great but\n\n108\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.860\nI can only create curved paths with it.\n\n109\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.365\nSo how helpful is that really.\n\n110\n00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:33.834\nCuz in most cases in reality we're\ngonna have a mix of the two,\n\n111\n00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:37.600\nyou can create a mix of the two,\neither upon drawing, or editing.\n\n112\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.382\nSo what we're gonna do,\n\n113\n00:05:38.382 --> 00:05:41.700\nwe have two different options for\ncreating a straight path.\n\n114\n00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.890\nOne, I can double click, so\nif I double click either, again,\n\n115\n00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.400\nas I'm creating something\nyou're editing later.\n\n116\n00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.490\nBy double-click that's gonna\ncreate a straight path forming.\n\n117\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.430\nThe other option that you have and\nI'll just do some curves in between.\n\n118\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.284\nThe other option that I have is to Alt or\nOption click.\n\n119\n00:05:58.284 --> 00:06:01.747\nSo if I Alt or Option click, you can even\nsee this is one of those situations where\n\n120\n00:06:01.747 --> 00:06:04.501\nIllustrator kind of gives you\nthe information on your cursor.\n\n121\n00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:08.677\nAs I'm holding down my ALT key, I see that\ncurvature tool with slash that's gonna let\n\n122\n00:06:08.677 --> 00:06:10.939\nme know, okay, I'm making a straight path,\n\n123\n00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.535\nwhich is slightly different from\nthe symbol that they use in other tools.\n\n124\n00:06:14.535 --> 00:06:16.649\nSo that's just one thing\nto pay attention to.\n\n125\n00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:19.509\nBut now I can curve, curve,\ncurve, curve, curve, close.\n\n126\n00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:22.134\nWhat if I want to edit one of these,\nwhat if I need to go back and\n\n127\n00:06:22.134 --> 00:06:25.380\nactually I want this one to be be curved,\njust double-click on it again and\n\n128\n00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.850\nit will flip it.\n\n129\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.637\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:28.260\n&gt;&gt; Woah.\n\n131\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.414\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're still in the curvature tool?\n\n132\n00:06:31.414 --> 00:06:31.917\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n133\n00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:36.030\nI'm like she's gonna go to the anchor\npoint tool or go back to the white.\n\n134\n00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.150\nNo, same tool.\n\n135\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.910\nDouble click, that will change from\nstraight to curve, curve to straight.\n\n136\n00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:42.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n137\n00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.510\nThey have taken out the need for\n\n138\n00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.835\nall those other tools basically,\nwhich is really pretty cool.\n\n139\n00:06:50.835 --> 00:06:51.420\n&gt;&gt; Wow!\n\n140\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so like this, it's curved.\n\n141\n00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.560\nI'm gonna go ahead and double-click.\n\n142\n00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.090\nIt will go ahead and make it straight.\n\n143\n00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.010\n&gt;&gt; And if you double-click that straight\npoint that you just made again.\n\n144\n00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.464\n&gt;&gt; Make it curved.\n\n145\n00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:02.997\n&gt;&gt; Okay!\n\n146\n00:07:02.997 --> 00:07:04.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, or Alt or Option-click.\n\n147\n00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.000\nYou are not limited to just\ndouble-clicking Alt or Option-click.\n\n148\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.210\nAnd again that's when I say, it's either\nupon creation or while you're editing and\n\n149\n00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.030\nwhen I say editing I mean editing\nwith the curvature tool itself.\n\n150\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.120\nSo up down, up down, up down.\n\n151\n00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.560\nDouble click, double click, double\nclick or maybe I wanna go back here.\n\n152\n00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.190\nDidn't leave the curvature tool.\n\n153\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.820\nDouble click.\n\n154\n00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.400\nI wanna go ahead and make that straight.\n\n155\n00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.291\nDouble click I want to go ahead and\nmake that straight so.\n\n156\n00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:32.425\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n157\n00:07:32.425 --> 00:07:36.088\nI am pretty impressed right now.\n\n158\n00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:36.663\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n159\n00:07:36.663 --> 00:07:37.719\nI live to impress.\n\n160\n00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:39.862\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n161\n00:07:39.862 --> 00:07:42.406\nyou can go back to the wide arrow tool.\n\n162\n00:07:42.406 --> 00:07:44.641\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You can even go to the smooth tool that\n\n163\n00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:45.898\nwe looked at.\n\n164\n00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.332\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n165\n00:07:47.332 --> 00:07:48.366\nIt is still an option.\n\n166\n00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:50.405\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n167\n00:07:50.405 --> 00:07:54.270\nOkay, I might be using this from now on.\n\n168\n00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.821\n&gt;&gt; We were talking before, and\nyou were kinda like, yeah, whatever,\n\n169\n00:07:57.821 --> 00:07:58.934\nthe curvature tool.\n\n170\n00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:02.815\nOkay, be that way.\n\n171\n00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.662\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think it's fantastic.\n\n172\n00:08:04.662 --> 00:08:07.614\nI definitely think, especially if\nyou are just starting out, and\n\n173\n00:08:07.614 --> 00:08:11.040\nyou have no prior knowledge of the pen\ntool, you're probably gonna be like,\n\n174\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.900\nthis is great, and hopefully, you are.\n\n175\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.050\nHopefully that's what you're thinking.\n\n176\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:20.600\nSo just to kind of wrap this up,\nsomething that I wanted to show you with,\n\n177\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.980\ngoing back to that episode we did with the\nwide arrow tool, kind of the path editing.\n\n178\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.810\nAnd we showed the example of how to\ntake a circle and convert it to a heart.\n\n179\n00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.010\nI just wanted to show you,\nkind of from another perspective,\n\n180\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.020\nhow we could draw a heart\nwith our curvature tool.\n\n181\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.250\nSo hopefully I can\nremember this correctly,\n\n182\n00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.410\ncuz it's not something that\nI do on a day-to-day basis.\n\n183\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.070\nBut what we're gonna do, we're gonna go\nahead and start with a straight path.\n\n184\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.000\nThat's gonna be kind of the middle\npoint of our heart, the center.\n\n185\n00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.740\nSo I'm gonna double click\nto create a straight path.\n\n186\n00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.960\nThen I'm gonna single click, single click,\ndouble click cuz I want that\n\n187\n00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.020\npoint at the end, and\nthen single click, single click.\n\n188\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.920\nAnd then now here's only the tricky thing.\n\n189\n00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.800\nYes I need this to be a straight path, but\n\n190\n00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.340\nI've already created\na straight path there.\n\n191\n00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.860\nSo I just need to single click.\n\n192\n00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.492\nIf I were to double click on that, it\nwould try and trade it to a curved path.\n\n193\n00:09:10.492 --> 00:09:11.675\nSo that's the one little trick,\n\n194\n00:09:11.675 --> 00:09:15.430\nas you do need to be aware when you\nare connecting two, how it is set up.\n\n195\n00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.035\n&gt;&gt; Because you already designated\nit as a straight point when you\n\n196\n00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:19.540\ndouble-clicked it to start.\n\n197\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.016\n&gt;&gt; Exactly\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n198\n00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:22.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nit's kinda already thinking, okay,\n\n199\n00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.640\nbut this is already straight on\nthe other side, how that's gonna work.\n\n200\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.128\nAnd the beautiful thing is like no\nI did not make that perfectly but\n\n201\n00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:31.913\nI can very easily edit this here.\n\n202\n00:09:31.913 --> 00:09:34.949\nAnd I'll even swap so\nthat you see my fill color and\n\n203\n00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:39.502\nit's like hey that was easier than taking,\nI think in my case a circle, and\n\n204\n00:09:39.502 --> 00:09:41.998\nthen kind of converting that down to it.\n\n205\n00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.966\nSo I think it's kind of fun,\nit's kind of interesting and\n\n206\n00:09:44.966 --> 00:09:49.209\nthere are certainly some good tutorials if\nyou look elsewhere online whatever that\n\n207\n00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:52.618\ncan kind of show you some other\noptions that you can make with this.\n\n208\n00:09:52.618 --> 00:09:55.720\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Wow, seriously I'm listening.\n\n209\n00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n210\n00:09:57.344 --> 00:09:58.590\nThe student has become the teacher.\n\n211\n00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.791\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:01.219\n&gt;&gt; Teacher's become the student,\n\n213\n00:10:01.219 --> 00:10:01.936\nit's amazing.\n\n214\n00:10:01.936 --> 00:10:07.251\nThis is why like these newer\nfeatures of Illustrator CC's\n\n215\n00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:11.383\n2017 just make your life so much easier.\n\n216\n00:10:11.383 --> 00:10:12.722\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So thank you so much for\n\n217\n00:10:12.722 --> 00:10:14.608\nthat wonderful episode\non the curvature tool.\n\n218\n00:10:14.608 --> 00:10:16.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm glad I could\nmake your life easier.\n\n219\n00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:17.938\n&gt;&gt;

another\nexciting edition of CreativeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.276\nI'm your host Vonne Smith, and\nthis is Illustrator 2017 CC.\n\n5\n00:00:18.276 --> 00:00:19.774\nAnd it's so funny,\n\n6\n00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:25.780\nright before we started I tried to\nremind myself it's Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n7\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.510\nI'll probably keep messing those up.\n\n8\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.302\nBut that's good and that's okay,\nbecause Emily is here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:32.934\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To remind me of what we're actually\n\n10\n00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:34.880\ndoing in this show, so welcome.\n\n11\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.470\nThank you so much for\nbeing here and keeping me on track.\n\n12\n00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.177\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, no, no,\nwe're just testing everybody.\n\n13\n00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:39.940\nI couldn't even get it right?\n\n14\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.580\nHonestly, I'm not sure that I would get\nthe order of those two things right,\n\n15\n00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.600\nso yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.789\n&gt;&gt; You get it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n17\n00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.821\nit's funny that we're saying this today\nbecause this is aligning objects, and\n\n18\n00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:56.016\nwe should be aligning things properly\nin order, like Illustrator, CC 2017.\n\n19\n00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:58.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Great segue, yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.440\nYeah, yeah, exactly, so yes,\ntoday we're talking about alignment.\n\n21\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.100\nI love alignment.\n\n22\n00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.320\n&gt;&gt; I do, too.\n\n23\n00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.966\n&gt;&gt; I know you do, so I'm looking at you.\n\n24\n00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.579\nSo alignment is one of those things that,\nagain,\n\n25\n00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.460\nif you are just getting started, you might\nnot be as excited as I am right now.\n\n26\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.350\nYou might not think it sounds quite so\nfun.\n\n27\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.430\nBut the thing about it is when you really\nget down to working in Illustrator,\n\n28\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.847\nand you are designing things\nprofessionally and what not,\n\n29\n00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:30.165\naligning is gonna make a big\ndifference in your life.\n\n30\n00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:34.230\nCuz as a designer,\nI always want things to be nicely aligned,\n\n31\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.790\nand kind of all packaged together well.\n\n32\n00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.015\nSo what we're gonna do, we're gonna go\nahead and start with our Align panel.\n\n33\n00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:43.875\nAnd then we're gonna kind\nof transition just some\n\n34\n00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:48.245\nother alignment tools like guides,\nand grids, and all kinds of fun stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:49.775\nSo we'll go ahead and\nstart with our Align panel.\n\n36\n00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:52.715\nSo with that, I'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate three shapes.\n\n37\n00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:56.485\nI'm gonna give mine three different colors\njust so I can kind of distinguish them.\n\n38\n00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:58.135\nYou can use whatever colors you want to.\n\n39\n00:01:58.135 --> 00:01:59.333\nIf you just like one color,\n\n40\n00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.590\nif that's the only thing you like in life,\nstick with that.\n\n41\n00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.570\nThat's just fine.\n\n42\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.510\n[LAUGH] So what I'm gonna do,\nI'll try and branch out from my defaults.\n\n43\n00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.690\nSo I'll go green here.\n\n44\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020\nNormally everything is pink and orange.\n\n45\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.740\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n46\n00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.480\nGreen square,\nmaybe I'll do a circle just to be crazy.\n\n47\n00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.530\n&gt;&gt; Wow, you're living dangerously there,\naren't you?\n\n48\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.255\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know, I really am.\n\n49\n00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:24.336\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Normally, it's just the square.\n\n50\n00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:24.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n51\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.176\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, watch out, world.\n\n52\n00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:28.640\nI'm feeling wild this morning.\n\n53\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.960\nSo we'll do a blue circle, and\nthen I'm just gonna go back to my square.\n\n54\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.376\nSo I'm gonna do a-\n&gt;&gt; Pink!\n\n55\n00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:38.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.843\n&gt;&gt; I was having trouble.\n\n57\n00:02:38.843 --> 00:02:41.209\nI was, I wanna go pink, but\nshould I really go pink?\n\n58\n00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.837\nAll right, so\nwhat we're gonna be looking at here,\n\n59\n00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:46.732\nwe're starting out with\nspecifically our Align tools.\n\n60\n00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:49.210\nWe're talking about other ones that\nhelp with alignment in a second.\n\n61\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.439\nBut this is specifically\nthe ones referred to as Align.\n\n62\n00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.380\nNow a couple of different\nplaces where you can find this.\n\n63\n00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.202\nOne you can find this in your control bar.\n\n64\n00:02:56.202 --> 00:02:59.760\nNow mine right here, because of\nthe resolution on my screen, in order so\n\n65\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.082\nyou can see it a little bit better,\nisn't actually expanding for me.\n\n66\n00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.800\nWhat you're probably seeing\nyou have the word Align, and\n\n67\n00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.400\nthen next to it you have some\nicons that kinda look like\n\n68\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.910\na line with a couple boxes underneath it,\nor aside from it.\n\n69\n00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.580\nIt's basically gonna be a line and\ntwo boxes, and\n\n70\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.310\nthen in various different orders.\n\n71\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.050\nI can go ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.910\nclick on the word Align, and\nyou're gonna see what I'm talking about.\n\n73\n00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.310\nSo if you're kinda like me, and\n\n74\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.170\nyou're not seeing these things off\nto the side on your control bar,\n\n75\n00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.220\njust go ahead and click on the word Align\nand you're gonna be able to see it there.\n\n76\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.370\nSo that's an option for you.\n\n77\n00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.500\nYou can also go to your Window menu and\n\n78\n00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.642\ngrab the Align panel, which is\nprobably where I'll work off of today.\n\n79\n00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:39.905\nNow one thing that I wanted to mention,\n\n80\n00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:42.940\nI'm actually glad I pulled\nout my Align panel here.\n\n81\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.140\nThis is one of those where you\nhave options that are hidden.\n\n82\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.487\nSo what I wanna look at here,\nI wanna go ahead and\n\n83\n00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:51.779\nclick on those Panel Options button or\nthat Panel Options button,\n\n84\n00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.370\nwhich is just the three lines\nin the top right-hand corner.\n\n85\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.081\nI'm gonna go ahead and select that and\nI'm gonna choose Show Options,\n\n86\n00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.354\ncuz this little guy at the bottom\nis something really cool.\n\n87\n00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:02.200\nAnd I wanna talk about it at the end.\n\n88\n00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.020\nSo what am I gonna do here, basically,\nI wanna grab these three shapes.\n\n89\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.620\nNow say I wanted all three of these\nshapes to be aligned by their tops.\n\n90\n00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.600\nYes, you could go and kinda use this and\nuse your Smart Guides, and okay.\n\n91\n00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.700\nBut it's a little weird,\nespecially with the Smart Guides which,\n\n92\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.900\nif you don't know what that is,\nwe'll talk about that in a second,\n\n93\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.510\nespecially with that circle\nthere in the middle.\n\n94\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.260\nIt's kinda hard to align them,\nso our Align panel or\n\n95\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.670\nour Align tools in the control bar,\n\n96\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.520\nwhichever one you wanna use,\nis gonna come in really handy for that.\n\n97\n00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.290\nSo you can go ahead and just kind of\nfilter through your Align objects or\n\n98\n00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.500\nDistribute Objects options.\n\n99\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.260\nAnd you can see, like okay, I have this\noption over here on the right-hand side,\n\n100\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.740\nVertical Align Top.\n\n101\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.660\nI can go ahead and select that.\n\n102\n00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.310\nBam, everything is vertically\naligned to the top.\n\n103\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.306\nSeems like a simple thing, especially\ncuz mine were so close together.\n\n104\n00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:53.294\nIf I have something like way over here,\nand I go like this, and\n\n105\n00:04:53.294 --> 00:04:55.664\nthey are all kind of crazy,\nVertical Align Top.\n\n106\n00:04:55.664 --> 00:04:58.590\nIt's like, my gosh,\nthat just saved me so much time.\n\n107\n00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.970\nSo there are all kinds of different\noptions like ways I can do things\n\n108\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.960\nhorizontally.\n\n109\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.440\nSo I could kind of take\nsomething maybe down like this,\n\n110\n00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.150\ndo a horizontal align left.\n\n111\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.270\nAnd I can go ahead and do that like that.\n\n112\n00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.330\nLikewise you have your distribute options,\nwhich are kinda cool.\n\n113\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.640\nYour distribute will kinda\ntake everything and try and\n\n114\n00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.630\nwork on that spacing between\nthe items which is fun.\n\n115\n00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like the white space between\nthem and that can be a little misleading\n\n116\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.760\ntoo because since you have\nstars that have points.\n\n117\n00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.850\nIt occupies this amount of space, but\nthere's a lot more white space in here.\n\n118\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.574\nSo it can be a little misleading of where\nyou're like that doesn't look like equal\n\n119\n00:05:35.574 --> 00:05:36.814\nspace between them.\n\n120\n00:05:36.814 --> 00:05:40.522\nBut mathematically based on\ntheir centers or whatever,\n\n121\n00:05:40.522 --> 00:05:43.440\nthat is the actual space between them.\n\n122\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.530\nSometimes I'll do it, and\n\n123\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.890\nI'm like, nope, visually you've\ngotta nudge over this way a little.\n\n124\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.713\nOkay, that visually looks better, so.\n\n125\n00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:49.763\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I always tell people,\n\n126\n00:05:49.763 --> 00:05:52.264\nyou have to kind of pay attention to\nkind of visual weights of things.\n\n127\n00:05:52.264 --> 00:05:55.220\nUse your tools, but\nthen also your brain too, so.\n\n128\n00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.360\n&gt;&gt; Visual weights!\n\n129\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.340\nI like that.\n\n130\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.990\n&gt;&gt; I'm so fancy.\n\n131\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.087\n&gt;&gt; I might take that one.\n\n132\n00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:03.378\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now just things that are pretty\n\n133\n00:06:03.378 --> 00:06:06.410\nstraightforward, align to top,\nalign to bottom, gonna make sense.\n\n134\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.510\nWith some of your distribute options,\nagain,\n\n135\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.030\nyou're gonna have to kind of pay\nattention to, okay, using your brain.\n\n136\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.540\nAnd if that doesn't look right,\nlike if I do that, and\n\n137\n00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.890\nthen maybe align center and\nI decide, okay,\n\n138\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.290\nthat looks kind of funny cuz this one's\nover overlapping, see what happens there?\n\n139\n00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.950\nMaybe that's where using\nmy brain comes in handy.\n\n140\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.440\nAnd I wanna go ahead and do that.\n\n141\n00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.195\nBut for the most part,\nI think the Align tools are fantastic.\n\n142\n00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:33.730\nThere are things that I use all day\nlong and I would definitely recommend.\n\n143\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.096\nNow there are a couple of different\noptions that we have with these.\n\n144\n00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:40.089\nRight here what you'll notice,\nif I go ahead and\n\n145\n00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:45.380\nmake these kind of be more far apart, and\nI do my Vertical Align Top or whatever.\n\n146\n00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.150\nWhat you're gonna see with\nthe option that I have selected with\n\n147\n00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.110\nthe Vertical Align Top,\nit aligns to the topmost objects.\n\n148\n00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.520\nSo in my case,\nthat green square was the highest.\n\n149\n00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.210\nSo then naturally, Illustrator brought\neverything up to meet that option,\n\n150\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.720\nthat was in my Vertical Align Top.\n\n151\n00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.330\nNow say what if I wanted to align\nthe tops of all of my objects, but\n\n152\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.850\nI wanted to align the top of them\nto my art board for instance?\n\n153\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.020\nThat's an option that I have.\n\n154\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.200\nI can go ahead and select all these.\n\n155\n00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.130\nAnd then what you're gonna wanna\ndo is see this Align To option.\n\n156\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.708\nIn my case, it's in the bottom\nright-hand corner of my Align panel.\n\n157\n00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:23.316\nYou can also see it here, that Align To.\n\n158\n00:07:23.316 --> 00:07:26.120\nIt may be just in your\ncontrol bar there as well.\n\n159\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.410\nBut it's gonna have the same\nkind of icon in that Align To.\n\n160\n00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.750\nSo right now,\nit's at an Align To selection, so\n\n161\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.210\nit's just aligning to\nthe selections that I've made.\n\n162\n00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.480\nI can change this.\n\n163\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.224\nI'm gonna skip past Align To Key Objects,\nthat's awesome but\n\n164\n00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:39.948\nwe're gonna talk about it in a second.\n\n165\n00:07:39.948 --> 00:07:41.580\nAnd I'm gonna go to Align To Art Board.\n\n166\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.840\nSo I'm gonna choose Align To Art Board.\n\n167\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.720\nYou can see now that\nthat symbol is changing.\n\n168\n00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.620\nIt looked more like my art board icon\nthat we can see in our tool bar if we go\n\n169\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.690\nchange our art boards.\n\n170\n00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.030\nAnd we can see, okay,\nVertical Align Top, and\n\n171\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.250\nnow that's all aligned to\nthe top of my art board.\n\n172\n00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.164\nSo you do have the option to change.\n\n173\n00:07:58.164 --> 00:08:00.830\nIt gives you that little\nbit of flexibility there.\n\n174\n00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.474\nNow the last one that I wanted to\nmention is Align To Key Object.\n\n175\n00:08:04.474 --> 00:08:06.614\nI love a line to key object [LAUGH].\n\n176\n00:08:06.614 --> 00:08:07.921\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I just think it's so nice.\n\n177\n00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:08.473\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n178\n00:08:08.473 --> 00:08:11.554\nwhat we can do here,\nif I have all these, and okay,\n\n179\n00:08:11.554 --> 00:08:16.074\nnaturally if I do Align to Selection\nit's gonna align to the top of the green\n\n180\n00:08:16.074 --> 00:08:21.150\nsquare, or if Ido Align to Artboard it's\ngonna go to the top of the artboard.\n\n181\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.389\nWhat if I wanted to align\nthe tops of all these shapes, but\n\n182\n00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:28.860\nI wanted to align them to the top of the\npink square or the top of the blue circle?\n\n183\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.826\nWhat would I do?\n\n184\n00:08:29.826 --> 00:08:32.981\nIn that case, we're gonna designate\na key object, and you'll see,\n\n185\n00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:36.365\nI just did it as I was talking, and\nit was so subtle, you may have missed it.\n\n186\n00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:38.135\nAll I have to do to select or\n\n187\n00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:43.060\ndesignate a key object to align to\nis just single-click on that object.\n\n188\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.598\nSo you can see when I single-click on an\nobject, after I have everything selected,\n\n189\n00:08:48.598 --> 00:08:51.797\nit will go ahead and\nadd that blue outline there.\n\n190\n00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:55.816\nSo that extra blue outline lets me know,\nokay, that is my key object.\n\n191\n00:08:55.816 --> 00:08:57.797\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou can switch it like just what you did.\n\n192\n00:08:57.797 --> 00:09:00.401\nYou had all three selection and\nlike click, click, click.\n\n193\n00:09:00.401 --> 00:09:05.142\nSo it's not one of those I only get\none chance to select the key object.\n\n194\n00:09:05.142 --> 00:09:07.337\nIt's like no, the blue, no the pink.\n\n195\n00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:11.821\nOkay, let's go with the blue, and\nthen once you've designated it,\n\n196\n00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:16.308\nthat's when the magic happens, and\nyes, I love this align feature.\n\n197\n00:09:16.308 --> 00:09:18.916\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's one of those things\nthat doesn't seem like a big deal,\n\n198\n00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:21.210\nbut really can save you a lot\nof time in the long run I think.\n\n199\n00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.193\nSo yes, I'm switching back and forth.\n\n200\n00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:26.488\nI'm feeling footloose and fancy free,\nI don't want to pick just one.\n\n201\n00:09:26.488 --> 00:09:29.289\nSo what you will see too\nwith this is that Align To,\n\n202\n00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:33.516\nif you kind of look back at this icon\nhere, it went ahead and changed for us.\n\n203\n00:09:33.516 --> 00:09:35.168\nSo I didn't actually do anything.\n\n204\n00:09:35.168 --> 00:09:38.115\nI didn't go here,\ngo to align to key object, none of that.\n\n205\n00:09:38.115 --> 00:09:41.307\nAll I did when I single-clicked, and\nyou'll even see when I unselected\n\n206\n00:09:41.307 --> 00:09:44.915\neverything it went back to that align to\nartboard, but when I select everything,\n\n207\n00:09:44.915 --> 00:09:48.421\nand then single-click to choose to my\nkey object it's automatically gonna get\n\n208\n00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.866\nthat icon with the key in there.\n\n209\n00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:52.997\nSo now that we've explained it,\nlet's [LAUGH] actually see what happens.\n\n210\n00:09:52.997 --> 00:09:55.979\nSo now if I take this and\nI do vertical align top,\n\n211\n00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:59.280\nit's gonna align to the tops\nof that pink square.\n\n212\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.600\nSo again, just really handy and\ncould probably save you some time.\n\n213\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.321\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely, and there's one\nthing when you change that Align To,\n\n214\n00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:09.279\ncuz I'll put it to Align to Artboard.\n\n215\n00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:14.229\nI switch back and forth with these all\nthe time, but I'll have Align to Artboard,\n\n216\n00:10:14.229 --> 00:10:18.536\nclose Illustrator down, maybe not\neven use Illustrator for two days,\n\n217\n00:10:18.536 --> 00:10:22.051\ncome back in, select everything,\nand then like wait,\n\n218\n00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:26.354\nI had Align to Artboard still in\nthe options, if you wanna say here, and\n\n219\n00:10:26.354 --> 00:10:30.150\nI have to remember to go back and\nsay nope, select to objects.\n\n220\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.737\nThat's happened to me a few times here and\nthere.\n\n221\n00:10:32.737 --> 00:10:35.401\nI can't remember if it was, if it\ncleared after you close Illustrator, but\n\n222\n00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.292\ndefinitely working across multiple files-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n223\n00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:38.298\n&gt;&gt; And things like that.\n\n224\n00:10:38.298 --> 00:10:41.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, or\neven just you go to do something just\n\n225\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.741\n30 minutes later,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n226\n00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:43.779\n&gt;&gt; And you're like ugh.\n\n227\n00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:44.853\n&gt;&gt; In the same file, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n228\n00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:45.956\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like man.\n\n229\n00:10:45.956 --> 00:10:50.365\nIt's like first world problems,\nmy align tool panel is not working.\n\n230\n00:10:50.365 --> 00:10:51.718\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it can be frustrating.\n\n231\n00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:53.996\n&gt;&gt; It's like, why aren't you\nthinking exactly like my brain?\n\n232\n00:10:53.996 --> 00:10:56.917\nIt's like, will you, you'll probably get\nit eventually where we're just gonna plug\n\n233\n00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:59.024\nour brain into our computer,\nand it'll do everything for us.\n\n234\n00:10:59.024 --> 00:11:01.163\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that might be scary [LAUGH].\n\n235\n00:11:01.163 --> 00:11:03.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI don't think the computer wants to know.\n\n236\n00:11:03.835 --> 00:11:07.721\n[LAUGH] All right, so with that, the last\nthing I wanted to mention with our align\n\n237\n00:11:07.721 --> 00:11:11.156\npanel is this distributes spacing\noption which I think is really fun.\n\n238\n00:11:11.156 --> 00:11:15.376\nSo what I can do here I'm just gonna\nkind of haphazardly distribute these.\n\n239\n00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:17.685\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nalign their tops just so\n\n240\n00:11:17.685 --> 00:11:19.710\nyou can see how I'm a fan of Align to Top.\n\n241\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.060\nMaybe I'll Align to Bottom just\nto really throw you off here.\n\n242\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.549\nVertical align bottom.\n\n243\n00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:25.812\nYou'll see because I had\nartboards like this.\n\n244\n00:11:25.812 --> 00:11:27.903\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I had did my artboard now I wanted\n\n245\n00:11:27.903 --> 00:11:30.382\nit to go to my selection,\nbut didn't know my brain.\n\n246\n00:11:30.382 --> 00:11:33.499\nSo I had to go with the last\nthing in the options.\n\n247\n00:11:33.499 --> 00:11:36.293\nNow I wanna choose this\nnon-distribute object.\n\n248\n00:11:36.293 --> 00:11:37.490\nAlthough this is nice.\n\n249\n00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.440\nWe can kind of, okay,\nhorizontal distribute center there,\n\n250\n00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.928\nand I'm gonna Cmd or Ctrl+Z.\n\n251\n00:11:41.928 --> 00:11:44.860\nI wanna specifically distribute spacing.\n\n252\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.710\nSo what does that mean?\n\n253\n00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.567\nOften times in Illustrator when\nyou're working, you say, okay,\n\n254\n00:11:50.567 --> 00:11:54.642\nI wanna know that there's an exact\ndistance between these two things.\n\n255\n00:11:54.642 --> 00:11:59.328\nSo what I wanna do, I wanna go ahead and\nset maybe half an inch between the circle\n\n256\n00:11:59.328 --> 00:12:02.037\nand then the squares on\nthe either side of it.\n\n257\n00:12:02.037 --> 00:12:05.263\nSo, it's gonna starts of gonna\nsimilar to our key object.\n\n258\n00:12:05.263 --> 00:12:07.526\nI need to go and select all of these, and\n\n259\n00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:11.642\nthen single-click on my circle to\ndesignate that as my key object, and\n\n260\n00:12:11.642 --> 00:12:15.893\nthen now when you see that, this kind\nof it was greyed out before when I just\n\n261\n00:12:15.893 --> 00:12:19.066\nhad everything selected\nwith my distribute spacing.\n\n262\n00:12:19.066 --> 00:12:22.500\nBut now when I go ahead and choose my\nkey object, it's gonna go ahead and\n\n263\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.829\ngive me that option there.\n\n264\n00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:27.797\nSo I can go ahead and either use my\narrows, or kind of type something in, or\n\n265\n00:12:27.797 --> 00:12:30.429\nI'll just use my arrows\nuntil I get half an inch.\n\n266\n00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:35.801\nThat's fine, and then after you designate\na dimension then you're gonna go ahead and\n\n267\n00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:38.610\nactually click the button\nto make it happen.\n\n268\n00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.846\nThis kind of confused me at first, cuz I\nwould try and make something happen, and\n\n269\n00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:44.422\nthen designate the spacing.\n\n270\n00:12:44.422 --> 00:12:47.679\nYou need to go ahead and put in your\nvalue of how far you want it to go, and\n\n271\n00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:50.939\nthen you're gonna choose,\nokay either vertical distribute space or\n\n272\n00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:52.450\nhorizontal distribute space.\n\n273\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.310\nSo in my case I'm gonna do\nhorizontal distribute space, and\n\n274\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.740\nbam now I know I have exactly half\nan inch between the circle, and\n\n275\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.810\nthen either side I have a half\nan inch with that square, or at least\n\n276\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.800\nI'm trusting Illustrator is actually\ngiving me a [LAUGH] half an inch there.\n\n277\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.920\nBut we can measure it later,\nwhich we'll see.\n\n278\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.848\nVonne is excited over here.\n\n279\n00:13:12.848 --> 00:13:15.834\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I've seen that, or\n\n280\n00:13:15.834 --> 00:13:20.720\nused it, and I'm sitting here with\nmy mouth open, I'm like, really?\n\n281\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n\n282\n00:13:22.246 --> 00:13:27.060\nI've done it different ways, but I,\nsorry, I'm a little speechless right now.\n\n283\n00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.171\nI don't want to do with myself,\nI was thinking, my gosh if I\n\n284\n00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:36.094\nwere just used that command in Project X\nit would have been so much easier.\n\n285\n00:13:36.094 --> 00:13:39.120\nSo I'm having a moment people.\n\n286\n00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.785\nI might need to be quiet for\nawhile [LAUGH].\n\n287\n00:13:41.785 --> 00:13:44.180\n&gt;&gt; You take as long as you need now.\n\n288\n00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.795\nAll right, so\nI'm actually gonna set these aside,\n\n289\n00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:50.134\nbecause I wanna go ahead and\ntest Illustrator on this skill later.\n\n290\n00:13:50.134 --> 00:13:53.507\nBut, one thing that I wanna do,\njust to kind of move on here,\n\n291\n00:13:53.507 --> 00:13:55.805\nis talk about our guides real briefly.\n\n292\n00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:57.110\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n293\n00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.453\npull those away, and we'll come back\nto them later, cuz we'll actually,\n\n294\n00:14:00.453 --> 00:14:03.969\nwe're gonna test the illustrator out to\nsee if that actually was a half an inch.\n\n295\n00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:07.910\nSo what we're gonna do here, I wanna\nmove into talking about my Smart Guides.\n\n296\n00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.428\nNow I mentioned Smart Guides a second ago,\nand you you may be going,\n\n297\n00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:12.868\nwhat is she talking about?\n\n298\n00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:14.500\nSee all these pink things that come up?\n\n299\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.021\nIt's probably something that you've\nseen and maybe we're kind of using,\n\n300\n00:14:18.021 --> 00:14:21.982\neven if you didn't necessarily realize it,\nbut didn't know what they were called,\n\n301\n00:14:21.982 --> 00:14:24.641\ndidn't know it was really an option,\nthings like that.\n\n302\n00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:26.884\nAny time you see those pink lines,\nbasically,\n\n303\n00:14:26.884 --> 00:14:29.975\nthat's what Illustrator is\nreferring to as your Smart Guides.\n\n304\n00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:33.226\nI do think you can actually change\nthe color in your preferences if you go to\n\n305\n00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:37.068\nthe preferences, smart guide, if you're\nnot feeling pink, we all know I love pink.\n\n306\n00:14:37.068 --> 00:14:39.029\n[LAUGH] So,\nobviously I keep mine like that, but\n\n307\n00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:42.478\nif you wanna change yours to a different\ncolor, I believe that's an option there.\n\n308\n00:14:42.478 --> 00:14:46.043\nNow, so what is this gonna do for\nme, this is kind of letting me know,\n\n309\n00:14:46.043 --> 00:14:49.361\nokay here I have a perfect square\nwhen I see that diagonal slash,\n\n310\n00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:53.355\nas I'm creating a shape, or even when\nI'm going back to editing I can see okay\n\n311\n00:14:53.355 --> 00:14:57.373\nI have exactly, in this case it's\nlike 3 1/2 inches by 3 1/2 inches.\n\n312\n00:14:57.373 --> 00:14:59.315\nIt's letting me know how I\nhave that perfect square.\n\n313\n00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.848\n&gt;&gt; And you're not holding the shift key.\n\n314\n00:15:00.848 --> 00:15:01.960\n&gt;&gt; No, exactly.\n\n315\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz you could hold the shift key and\n\n316\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.931\nmake sure you definitely are making\na perfect square, but I do like that now,\n\n317\n00:15:07.931 --> 00:15:11.813\nand you can kind of almost feel it like\nwhere it kind of snaps almost a little bit\n\n318\n00:15:11.813 --> 00:15:16.144\nto you, and you're like okay, perfect,\ngood, I don't have to hold the shift key.\n\n319\n00:15:16.144 --> 00:15:19.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, exactly, and it's funny cuz\nI still by default hold the shift key.\n\n320\n00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.609\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n[LAUGH]\n\n321\n00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:22.145\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I just want that backup you know,\n\n322\n00:15:22.145 --> 00:15:23.386\n[LAUGH] but you don't really,\n\n323\n00:15:23.386 --> 00:15:25.780\nyou kind of don't have to\nanymore with the Smart Guides.\n\n324\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.352\nIf you wanna live again,\nfootloose and fancy free, and\n\n325\n00:15:28.352 --> 00:15:31.315\nlive on the edge, you could just\nuse your Smart Guides for that.\n\n326\n00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:35.055\nNow it's not just drawling and creating\nnew shapes, and again this is something\n\n327\n00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:39.015\nyou've probably already seen or noticed,\nbut just kind of looking at your alignment\n\n328\n00:15:39.015 --> 00:15:41.778\nlike see if I wanna kind of take\nthose two next to each other.\n\n329\n00:15:41.778 --> 00:15:43.389\nIt's automatically gonna try and\nto tell me,\n\n330\n00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:45.260\nokay this is where it's\ngonna align the two centers.\n\n331\n00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.192\nLike you can be aware of that or kind of\npay attention to the bottoms there, and\n\n332\n00:15:49.192 --> 00:15:52.399\nthen specially if I can kind of\nmake these two different sizes,\n\n333\n00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:54.290\nyou can kind of see the distinction.\n\n334\n00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.911\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n335\n00:15:54.911 --> 00:15:59.610\nit shows also the top of that rectangle is\naligning with the middle of the square.\n\n336\n00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.914\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it kind of shows all the different\n\n337\n00:16:01.914 --> 00:16:07.263\ntop, bottom, centers of each object And\nit also shows that intersect right there.\n\n338\n00:16:07.263 --> 00:16:11.950\nSo you can get a lot of little tips here\nand there, when they show words next to\n\n339\n00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.919\nwhatever it's showing with the lines,\nof how it's lining up.\n\n340\n00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:20.445\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, and it's just one\nof those things that just kind of is\n\n341\n00:16:20.445 --> 00:16:23.740\nintuitively, very helpful\noption in illustrator.\n\n342\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.480\nNow if you're not feeling Smart Guides,\nif you just start annoyed by all these\n\n343\n00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.910\nthings popping up,\nit is an option to get rid of them.\n\n344\n00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.315\nSo what you can do,\nyou can go to your View menu and\n\n345\n00:16:33.315 --> 00:16:35.978\nthen go all the way down to\nwhere it says Smart Guides.\n\n346\n00:16:35.978 --> 00:16:40.658\nIt's also Cmd or Ctrl, Cmd on a Mac,\nCtrl on a PC, and the letter U.\n\n347\n00:16:40.658 --> 00:16:44.020\nWhich makes absolutely no sense, but\nI'm sure all of the S's were taken.\n\n348\n00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.840\nSo, you can go ahead and do Cmd or\nCtrl+U, and that will toggle your\n\n349\n00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.110\nSmart Guides on and off, if for\nsome reason you're just not feeling it.\n\n350\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.470\nNow we can talk about kind\nof our old-fashioned guide.\n\n351\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.020\nSo before Smart Guide existed, or\n\n352\n00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.600\nat least existed in Illustrator,\nI believe they existed in other programs.\n\n353\n00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.940\nWe used something just known as guides,\nand these are kind of our regular guides.\n\n354\n00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:12.090\nAnd actually, I still find them to be very\nhelpful, they're still things that I use.\n\n355\n00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:15.370\nMaybe not as commonly, now that Smart\nGuides are really built into Illustrator.\n\n356\n00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:19.185\nBut I would definitely recommend at least\nat least knowing that they're there.\n\n357\n00:17:19.185 --> 00:17:21.921\nWhat I'm going to do, first step\nis I need to turn on my ruler, so\n\n358\n00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:24.481\nwe kind of have a two-step process for\ngetting our guides.\n\n359\n00:17:24.481 --> 00:17:28.182\nTo turn on our rulers,\nwe're just going to do Cmd or\n\n360\n00:17:28.182 --> 00:17:31.378\nCtrl+R, R as in ruler, so Cmd or Ctrl+R.\n\n361\n00:17:31.378 --> 00:17:35.430\nAgain, I think that one's also\navailable in your Vew menu,\n\n362\n00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.170\nif you go to View &gt; Rulers &gt; Hide Rulers,\netc., etc.\n\n363\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.888\nThere's a difference between\nglobal rulers and artboard rulers,\n\n364\n00:17:41.888 --> 00:17:43.802\nbut we're not gonna talk\nabout that right now.\n\n365\n00:17:43.802 --> 00:17:46.731\nSo we don't need to change\nit to global rulers, but\n\n366\n00:17:46.731 --> 00:17:50.020\nwhat we can look at here is say okay,\ngreat, I have that.\n\n367\n00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.150\nNow, by default,\nbecause my document is set up in inches,\n\n368\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.970\nthis is going to give me rulers\nset up in inches, right?\n\n369\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.632\nIf you wanted to change that for some\nreason, you wanted to use these rulers.\n\n370\n00:18:01.632 --> 00:18:03.850\nYou were kinda trying to\nalign things to it, but\n\n371\n00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.850\nyou didn't need it to be in inches?\n\n372\n00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:10.660\nYou could right-click, and you could\nchange that to Pixels for instance.\n\n373\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.630\nYou'll see, I believe in this case,\ndid it change it on the other side, yes.\n\n374\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.019\nIn some cases or maybe some iterations,\nit only changed the top and only changed\n\n375\n00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:20.763\nthe side, but that now just [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I think InDesign,\n\n376\n00:18:20.763 --> 00:18:25.502\nInDesign you have to always, I don't\nknow about the new versions, obviously.\n\n377\n00:18:25.502 --> 00:18:27.507\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the older versions, yeah,\n\n378\n00:18:27.507 --> 00:18:31.200\nyou would have different measurements for\ndifferent rulers, if you wanted to.\n\n379\n00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.508\nI'm pretty sure\nIlllustrator always did it,\n\n380\n00:18:33.508 --> 00:18:35.705\nnow I'm kind of second-guessing myself.\n\n381\n00:18:35.705 --> 00:18:37.735\nBut yeah, you can change it if you want.\n\n382\n00:18:37.735 --> 00:18:39.745\n&gt;&gt; It's always one of those\nthings that I pay attention to.\n\n383\n00:18:39.745 --> 00:18:42.125\nBecause I know that in the past,\nor at times, or\n\n384\n00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:43.725\nin other programs, it doesn't do that.\n\n385\n00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:46.261\nBut it looks like in Illustrator,\nsoon as you change one, you go and\n\n386\n00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:46.985\nchange the other.\n\n387\n00:18:46.985 --> 00:18:50.215\nNow I'm fine with inches, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and leave it at that.\n\n388\n00:18:50.215 --> 00:18:54.319\nAnd then what we can do here,\nto actually create a guide.\n\n389\n00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:57.317\nSo remember, we were talking about guides,\nit's just a two-step process here.\n\n390\n00:18:57.317 --> 00:19:02.063\nAll you have to do to create a guide is\nclick, hold, and drag out of your ruler.\n\n391\n00:19:02.063 --> 00:19:08.350\nSo I'm actually gonna single click within\nthis Ruler bar, hold and drag down.\n\n392\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.840\nAnd what you'll see now,\neven as I'm hovering over it,\n\n393\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.720\nthat Smart Guide kinda lets me know,\nokay, that's a guide.\n\n394\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.410\nIt's kind of this cyan line, or teal blue,\n\n395\n00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.950\nwhatever you wanna call it,\nis what you're gonna get.\n\n396\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.110\nAnd now you'll see, I believe, yes,\nthis should be locked by default.\n\n397\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.582\nAnd then now I can use this,\n\n398\n00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:29.487\nsay I have a bunch of things that I'm\nall trying to align to this one line.\n\n399\n00:19:29.487 --> 00:19:31.822\nYeah, you could use your Align Objects.\n\n400\n00:19:31.822 --> 00:19:36.432\nBut if I'm just continuously going\nback to this one specific place,\n\n401\n00:19:36.432 --> 00:19:39.462\nespecially with a bunch\nof smaller objects?\n\n402\n00:19:39.462 --> 00:19:44.730\nI oftentimes find it helpful to\nhave lines, guides there for me.\n\n403\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.200\nAnd again, I can do the same\nthing off of my other axis.\n\n404\n00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.475\nSo I can click, hold, and\ndrag from that ruler again,\n\n405\n00:19:51.475 --> 00:19:55.337\nsingle-click in that ruler and\nhold and drag, pull those out.\n\n406\n00:19:55.337 --> 00:19:59.040\nI can have as many as I want,\nif I want two over there, for instance.\n\n407\n00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.598\nI can go ahead and say,\nokay I want that tool line there,\n\n408\n00:20:01.598 --> 00:20:02.911\nI want that tool line there.\n\n409\n00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:06.358\nAnd go ahead and\nuse as many as you possibly want, yeah.\n\n410\n00:20:06.358 --> 00:20:09.287\n&gt;&gt; I use guides here for margins,\n\n411\n00:20:09.287 --> 00:20:14.254\ncuz you don't really have\nmargins in Illustrator.\n\n412\n00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:19.025\nLet's say, I can't have anything go\npass like the half-inch mark on the left\n\n413\n00:20:19.025 --> 00:20:21.720\nhand side, there's no way I can have that.\n\n414\n00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.623\nAlso designating safe areas for\ncertain things.\n\n415\n00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:28.491\nSo this is a reason why is that,\nand yes, they are locked.\n\n416\n00:20:28.491 --> 00:20:32.604\nWhich can throw you off because other\nprograms, they're not locked, so\n\n417\n00:20:32.604 --> 00:20:34.934\nit's like, I just wanna move it.\n\n418\n00:20:34.934 --> 00:20:37.647\nI gotta unlock them and\nthen be able to move them,\n\n419\n00:20:37.647 --> 00:20:40.240\nyou gotta lock them back down and\neverything.\n\n420\n00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.590\nSo sometimes just kind of knowing\nthat this program does that, and\n\n421\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.630\nhaving to turn them on and\noff is just something to remember.\n\n422\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.140\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, and it is a little\nbit different than Photoshop or\n\n423\n00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.550\nsome of the other programs where you\nhave that flexibility to move them.\n\n424\n00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.826\nBut sometimes I actually think it's\nnice that they're locked by default.\n\n425\n00:20:55.826 --> 00:20:59.507\nSo how to I unlock them, If I'm tired of\nthis one and I wanna get rid of it, or\n\n426\n00:20:59.507 --> 00:21:02.096\nI wanna move it or\nsomething like that, what do I do?\n\n427\n00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:05.150\nI wanna make sure I have nothing\nselected on my artboard.\n\n428\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.874\nYou can see nothing,\nnone of my green boxes have path outline,\n\n429\n00:21:08.874 --> 00:21:10.995\nI have nothing selected right now.\n\n430\n00:21:10.995 --> 00:21:14.444\nI'm just gonna single-click somewhere in\nhere, but I'm actually gonna right-click,\n\n431\n00:21:14.444 --> 00:21:15.574\nso I'm gonna right-click.\n\n432\n00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:18.444\nAnd you can see I can go\ndown to these options, okay,\n\n433\n00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.151\nI have one, I can Hide Guides.\n\n434\n00:21:20.151 --> 00:21:23.645\nSo if I wanted to keep them here but\njust didn't want to see them,\n\n435\n00:21:23.645 --> 00:21:27.161\nI can go ahead and Hide Guides, so\nyou can toggle them on and off.\n\n436\n00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:32.074\nThe keyboard shortcut for that is\nalso Cmd or Ctrl+Colon or Semicolon,\n\n437\n00:21:32.074 --> 00:21:34.500\nso that's an option that you have.\n\n438\n00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.820\nAnd then you can also unlock them,\nwhen you unlock them,\n\n439\n00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.170\nit gives you the flexibility to\ngo ahead and move them around.\n\n440\n00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.230\nOr if I just want to get rid of them,\none of them, I can kind of select it.\n\n441\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.270\nYou see how that with\none when I selected it,\n\n442\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.108\nand it turned to a darker shade of blue?\n\n443\n00:21:49.108 --> 00:21:52.600\nThat just lets me know, okay, I have\nthat one chosen, and I can go ahead and\n\n444\n00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.056\ndelete that off of my artboard.\n\n445\n00:21:54.056 --> 00:21:56.250\nI'm just using my Delete\nkey off of my keyboard,\n\n446\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.830\nsame way that you would if you\nwere deleting anything else.\n\n447\n00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.720\nSo guides are definitely something\nagain that I think are helpful,\n\n448\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.670\nand I liked Vonne's\nexamples of the margins.\n\n449\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.821\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just a few other little tips\nthat I've learned through all the years.\n\n450\n00:22:07.821 --> 00:22:12.089\nWhen I'm using things like margins or\nguides that are for my setup and\n\n451\n00:22:12.089 --> 00:22:14.527\nlayout of whatever I'm working with?\n\n452\n00:22:14.527 --> 00:22:18.684\nI, personally,\nI put them all on its own layer, too.\n\n453\n00:22:18.684 --> 00:22:21.692\nYeah, cuz they kind of\nget mixed up sometimes.\n\n454\n00:22:21.692 --> 00:22:24.764\nCuz if I am working in layers,\nand I'm in two and three and\n\n455\n00:22:24.764 --> 00:22:28.168\nfour, then I have a guide in layer\nfour and a guide in layer two?\n\n456\n00:22:28.168 --> 00:22:32.338\nIt's like, I don't really want them\nkind of all in with the stuff.\n\n457\n00:22:32.338 --> 00:22:36.710\nSo I'll make my own layer, go ahead and\nput all the guides in there,\n\n458\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.419\nand then I can use that layer\nsometimes to turn on and off.\n\n459\n00:22:40.419 --> 00:22:43.945\nI always use the Hide Guides,\nthat Cmd+Colon,\n\n460\n00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:46.680\nit's programmed in my brain-\n&gt;&gt; All day long.\n\n461\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.560\n&gt;&gt; Of how, right, cuz sometimes you\ndon't want to see the guides but\n\n462\n00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.884\nyou want to see the artwork and\neverything like that.\n\n463\n00:22:51.884 --> 00:22:53.847\nSo that's something that I suggest.\n\n464\n00:22:53.847 --> 00:22:57.830\nOne other suggestion that I have with\nguides is, once you unlock them and\n\n465\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.150\nselect them, and you have it selected.\n\n466\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.500\nYou can find either in\nthe Transform panel,\n\n467\n00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.590\nI think it's Transform panel,\nwhere you can find like the x-coordinate.\n\n468\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:10.830\nI need it to be exactly at\nhalf-inch from the left, so\n\n469\n00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.789\nI will change that x-value\nto whatever it is, and\n\n470\n00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:16.664\nnow that one on the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n471\n00:23:16.664 --> 00:23:18.759\nthat one on the right-hand\nside might be a little tricky,\n\n472\n00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:21.002\non the left-hand side it's\nprobably a little easier [LAUGH].\n\n473\n00:23:21.002 --> 00:23:23.116\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta start doing math and\nthings like that.\n\n474\n00:23:23.116 --> 00:23:25.739\nSo it's like, I have an 8.5 and 11 minus-\n&gt;&gt; It's too early to do math.\n\n475\n00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:28.904\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, but I do use those x and\n\n476\n00:23:28.904 --> 00:23:33.023\ny-coordinates when setting guides,\neither this way or this way,\n\n477\n00:23:33.023 --> 00:23:35.563\ndepending on, I'm like, where am I at?\n\n478\n00:23:35.563 --> 00:23:37.074\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which one?\n\n479\n00:23:37.074 --> 00:23:39.856\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of perfect of where we're at,\n\n480\n00:23:39.856 --> 00:23:43.028\nright here of, I need to know\nexactly this amount for my guide.\n\n481\n00:23:43.028 --> 00:23:49.168\nSo just another little tip and\ntrick from me to you about that.\n\n482\n00:23:49.168 --> 00:23:51.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great idea, actually,\n\n483\n00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.705\nto use your Transform panel, that's one\nof the good uses for that, so absolutely.\n\n484\n00:23:55.705 --> 00:23:59.525\nSo I now made these exactly half\nan inch from the left and the top.\n\n485\n00:23:59.525 --> 00:24:01.556\nI wasn't getting into\nthe math on the other side-\n\n486\n00:24:01.556 --> 00:24:02.347\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n487\n00:24:02.347 --> 00:24:04.076\n&gt;&gt; But you could, if you wanted to.\n\n488\n00:24:04.076 --> 00:24:07.942\nSo, with guides, one thing I want to point\nout real quick before we move onto grids.\n\n489\n00:24:07.942 --> 00:24:11.983\nIs make sure that now, okay, I've\nunlocked these, make sure you go back and\n\n490\n00:24:11.983 --> 00:24:15.396\nlock them, so if you want to-\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, yeah, my god, I'm so\n\n491\n00:24:15.396 --> 00:24:16.803\nglad you just added that.\n\n492\n00:24:16.803 --> 00:24:20.124\nBecause there is so many times where\nI'll do just that, click, hold, and\n\n493\n00:24:20.124 --> 00:24:21.794\ndrag cuz I'm selecting my objects.\n\n494\n00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:25.670\nAnd I'm grabbing the guides and I'm\nmoving them, and I didn't realize, oops,\n\n495\n00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.060\ngotta lock them,\ngotta go back and lock them.\n\n496\n00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.861\nSo it can be slightly frustrating,\nand even to me, cuz I keep forgetting.\n\n497\n00:24:32.861 --> 00:24:35.431\nAnd then you have to click off\nof everything to make sure you\n\n498\n00:24:35.431 --> 00:24:38.956\ncan right-click, cuz if you right-click\nsomething it'll select it, ugh.\n\n499\n00:24:38.956 --> 00:24:41.023\n&gt;&gt; Ugh, right, trying to do that,\nit's like, ugh!\n\n500\n00:24:41.023 --> 00:24:41.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n501\n00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:44.261\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually that did show up, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n502\n00:24:44.261 --> 00:24:45.550\n&gt;&gt; Bad example, so okay,\n\n503\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.424\nI hadn't selected it all the way.\n\n504\n00:24:47.424 --> 00:24:50.347\nSo yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and\nmake sure I have nothing selected, and\n\n505\n00:24:50.347 --> 00:24:52.413\nI'm gonna go back to Lock Guides,\nCmd or Ctrl.\n\n506\n00:24:52.413 --> 00:24:55.640\nNo, I'm sorry, Cmd or Ctrl+Semicolon\nturns them on and off, but yeah.\n\n507\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.030\n&gt;&gt; And you could do all this at the View\nmenu as well, in you wanted to unlock or\n\n508\n00:24:59.030 --> 00:24:59.720\nlock the guides.\n\n509\n00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.610\nI think it's all in the Guides,\nyeah, there you go.\n\n510\n00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.668\nThe Clear Guides, I forgot,\nthat's a good one too.\n\n511\n00:25:04.668 --> 00:25:06.976\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, actually,\nI'm glad that we went there.\n\n512\n00:25:06.976 --> 00:25:08.374\nSo yeah, View &gt; Guides, and then if for\n\n513\n00:25:08.374 --> 00:25:11.020\nsome reason you want to get rid of all\nof them, go ahead and hit Clear Guides.\n\n514\n00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.811\nAnd that's gonna go ahead and\nput everything away.\n\n515\n00:25:13.811 --> 00:25:16.767\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've used that,\nI'm glad we went through it too.\n\n516\n00:25:16.767 --> 00:25:17.641\n&gt;&gt; I know, we're cool.\n\n517\n00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:20.938\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I know you have more about-\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n518\n00:25:20.938 --> 00:25:25.898\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know we have some grids and\nsome snaps and everything like that,\n\n519\n00:25:25.898 --> 00:25:28.969\nand I would like to give\nthat their due time.\n\n520\n00:25:28.969 --> 00:25:33.354\nSo, I'm making us, I'm guiding you here,\nso maybe we'll come back for\n\n521\n00:25:33.354 --> 00:25:37.130\na part two so we can kind of get\nall the other things that we know.\n\n522\n00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.615\nCuz there is quite a bit more to cover,\nright?\n\n523\n00:25:39.615 --> 00:25:40.498\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree.\n\n524\n00:25:40.498 --> 00:25:41.995\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, yeah, right?\n\n525\n00:25:41.995 --> 00:25:43.888\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking about it,\nI said yeah, it's been a little long.\n\n526\n00:25:43.888 --> 00:25:46.071\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who's riding who here, so yeah.\n\n527\n00:25:46.071 --> 00:25:48.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n528\n00:25:48.101 --> 00:25:52.213\nwe will guide you back in another\nepisode in just a little bit, [SOUND].\n\n529\n00:25:52.213 --> 00:25:56.718\nBut for now, I got it, we're going to\nahead and sign off for CreativeProTV.\n\n530\n00:25:56.718 --> 00:25:57.972\nI've been your host, Vonne

another\nepisode of Creative Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:19.557\nI'm your host Vonne Smith, and we're\ncontinuing on with Illustrator CC 2017,\n\n5\n00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:22.146\nI've got it right, yes, I am in alignment.\n\n6\n00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:25.483\nAnd yes, this is a part two\nof our aligning objects, and\n\n7\n00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:28.331\nhere back to help us again is Ms.\nEmily Ramsey.\n\n8\n00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:28.884\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I'm so-\n\n9\n00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:29.733\n&gt;&gt; I'm so glad you're here.\n\n10\n00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.951\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm so glad to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:34.799\nAnd actually,\nI'm glad we took that little pause and\n\n12\n00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.648\ndid a part two because we\nthought about something, or\n\n13\n00:00:37.648 --> 00:00:41.466\nTaylor our director reminded us of\nsomething that we didn't mention.\n\n14\n00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.046\nSo now we have a new cool tricks to\ntalk about that we didn't even have\n\n15\n00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:44.556\non the list.\n\n16\n00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:45.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n17\n00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:48.499\nwe are gonna continue with our\nguides as we were discussing,\n\n18\n00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:51.623\njust one quick little tip that\nagain we remembered on our break.\n\n19\n00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:56.773\nAnd then also carry in to grids, and then\nsome outline mode, and that measure tool.\n\n20\n00:00:56.773 --> 00:00:59.630\nI'm gonna get back to measuring those\nthings that I mentioned earlier.\n\n21\n00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.172\nSo let's go ahead and\njump right back into illustrator.\n\n22\n00:01:02.172 --> 00:01:07.034\nNow again, while we were on that break,\nour director Taylor said you know what,\n\n23\n00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:09.270\ncan I make a guide that's diagonal?\n\n24\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.950\nAnd it just kind of, our brains were like,\nyes, you can actually.\n\n25\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we forgot to mention that.\n\n26\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.516\nSo something that you wanna do,\n\n27\n00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:20.128\nsay notice everything was perfectly\nhorizontal or vertical there.\n\n28\n00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:25.002\nBut I want something a little fancier than\nthat, I want to create a diagonal guide.\n\n29\n00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:28.610\nWhat I can do, I'm gonna go ahead and\ngrab my line segment tool.\n\n30\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.100\nI'm just gonna draw a diagonal\nline across my art board here.\n\n31\n00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.010\nAnd really cool trick that you can use, I\ncan keep this selected, don't go back and\n\n32\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.456\nclick over here, make sure it is selected.\n\n33\n00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:44.382\nYou see mine has no fill or no stroke\ncolor that doesn't necessarily matter, but\n\n34\n00:01:44.382 --> 00:01:46.995\nI just don't feel like\napplying any color right now.\n\n35\n00:01:46.995 --> 00:01:50.207\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna go to my View menu,\n\n36\n00:01:50.207 --> 00:01:54.530\nthen I'm gonna go down the Guides,\nand I'm gonna choose Make Guide.\n\n37\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.728\nSo when I pick that, Make Guide,\n\n38\n00:01:56.728 --> 00:02:00.981\nyou'll see that converted that to a guide,\nwhich is just cool.\n\n39\n00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:02.704\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, right?\n\n40\n00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:06.598\n&gt;&gt; And it was one of those things where\nhe asked and we were both, my gosh, yeah,\n\n41\n00:02:06.598 --> 00:02:08.245\nI'm actually done this before.\n\n42\n00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:10.648\nBecause on that talking\nabout those margins, and\n\n43\n00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:13.650\nthis is just a line that I would\nactually make a rectangle.\n\n44\n00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.130\nMake sure the dimensions are exactly\nwhat that inner space needs to be,\n\n45\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.032\nalign it right in the center,\nand then choose make guides.\n\n46\n00:02:20.032 --> 00:02:21.469\nI'm like, yes, I've done this before.\n\n47\n00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.053\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n48\n00:02:22.053 --> 00:02:24.940\n&gt;&gt; This is so cool, yeah,\nwe both forgot about how you could do it.\n\n49\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.579\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.351\n&gt;&gt; And then yeah, you can totally make\na diagonal, I almost said horizontal,\n\n51\n00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:31.554\na diagonal guide.\n\n52\n00:02:31.554 --> 00:02:33.652\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, but like you said,\n\n53\n00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.104\nyou can use anything, I think-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n54\n00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:38.728\n&gt;&gt; You can use a rectangle, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and delete this one just so\n\n55\n00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:40.024\nit's not in the middle.\n\n56\n00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:43.567\nBut yeah, she was saying go ahead and\ndo something like that,\n\n57\n00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:46.852\nuse your own line panel,\nkinda align this to the center.\n\n58\n00:02:46.852 --> 00:02:49.820\nI'm not really perfecting this but\nyou can kinda see what I would do.\n\n59\n00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.877\nView, Guides, Make Guides,\nand its gonna go ahead and\n\n60\n00:02:52.877 --> 00:02:54.709\nconvert that into a guide for me.\n\n61\n00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.400\nSo you can kinda use that as your margins.\n\n62\n00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.642\nI'm basically just repeating\neverything she just said.\n\n63\n00:02:58.642 --> 00:02:59.579\nBut I wanted to go ahead and do it so\n\n64\n00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.064\nyou could kinda see what\nthat look like right there.\n\n65\n00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:02.952\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's nice that we have a visual reference.\n\n66\n00:03:02.952 --> 00:03:03.596\n&gt;&gt; yeah.\n\n67\n00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:05.094\n&gt;&gt; This is how you can actually do it,\nso yeah.\n\n68\n00:03:05.094 --> 00:03:08.830\nAnd the center center thing, I'm always\naligning center centers for some reason,\n\n69\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.156\noverlapping circles and squares,\nthe target logo we keep talking about.\n\n70\n00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:12.734\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:13.808\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just go ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:13.808 --> 00:03:17.261\nmake sure they're right center center,\nand you're good to go, so yay.\n\n73\n00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:17.903\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n74\n00:03:17.903 --> 00:03:18.723\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Taylor.\n\n75\n00:03:18.723 --> 00:03:19.615\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Taylor,\n\n76\n00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:20.761\nyou get a little shout-out there.\n\n77\n00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:24.821\nSo I'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna either,\nmaybe I'll go ahead, oop, that was,\n\n78\n00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.020\nI just locked it,\nI was trying to unlock it.\n\n79\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.677\nSo go ahead and get rid of that just so\nwe can see our grids a little bit better.\n\n80\n00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:35.180\nSo grids are kinda like the cousin\nto guides basically, if you will.\n\n81\n00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.810\nWhat we can do, I'm gonna go ahead and\nturn on my grids, cuz I think the best way\n\n82\n00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.512\nto show you what that is,\nis to go ahead and just turn it on.\n\n83\n00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:45.253\nSo, again either way you can\ngo to your View menu and\n\n84\n00:03:45.253 --> 00:03:50.930\ngo down to Show Grid, or I'm going\nto right click and choose Show Grid.\n\n85\n00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.247\nThat's usually kind of my go to is\nthe right click method but you do you,\n\n86\n00:03:54.247 --> 00:03:55.365\nwhatever you wanna do.\n\n87\n00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:57.620\nAnd I can go ahead and turn on this grid.\n\n88\n00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.427\nSo this grid is basically just like\na lot of guides to help you go ahead and\n\n89\n00:04:01.427 --> 00:04:02.258\nalign things.\n\n90\n00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:03.637\nSo oftentimes in design,\n\n91\n00:04:03.637 --> 00:04:06.907\nyou wanna make sure that things\nare kinda perfectly aligned.\n\n92\n00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:11.104\nNow, when I say the word perfect, I really\nwanna kinda be careful there because\n\n93\n00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:14.500\nI think that tends to naturally\nflow people into Pixel Perfect.\n\n94\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.980\nThis is not a pixel preview, this is not\nnecessarily what you're looking at here,\n\n95\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.357\nit's just guides to help you align things.\n\n96\n00:04:21.357 --> 00:04:22.510\nThere are options for\n\n97\n00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.040\nmaking sure everything's perfectly\naligned to the pixel grid.\n\n98\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.673\nAnd certainly we're gonna get to that\nwhen we do our kinda saving for web and\n\n99\n00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:30.605\nthings like that.\n\n100\n00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:36.200\nBut for right now this is really just,\nokay, basic alignment.\n\n101\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.925\nAnd it's nice, you can use this,\nI'm gonna kind of zoom in here.\n\n102\n00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:42.260\nI can go ahead and be like okay,\nI wanna draw something, and\n\n103\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.350\nI wanna make sure that it's\nkind of perfectly in line.\n\n104\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.606\nAnd it just helps you when\nyou're working to make sure,\n\n105\n00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:50.582\nespecially if you're doing something\nmaybe a little bit more detailed,\n\n106\n00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.176\nto ensure that everything is lined up.\n\n107\n00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:57.580\nNow, kind of a handy thing that goes along\nwith this is this snap to guides option.\n\n108\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.640\nSo if I go back into my View menu.\n\n109\n00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.553\n&gt;&gt; Or Snap to Grid.\n\n110\n00:05:00.553 --> 00:05:01.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:02.301\n&gt;&gt; Snap.\n\n112\n00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:03.132\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's guides, you know.\n\n113\n00:05:03.132 --> 00:05:04.881\n&gt;&gt; G, I dunno.\n\n114\n00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:08.586\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna go ahead and\nturn on this Snap to Grid, so View and\n\n115\n00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:12.050\nthen almost all the way down at\nthe bottom you have Snap to Grid.\n\n116\n00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.336\nAnd what that's gonna do for\nus is just make this a little bit easier.\n\n117\n00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:19.078\nSo you'll see, and it's almost even\nkind of hard to see as I'm doing it, but\n\n118\n00:05:19.078 --> 00:05:23.510\nit's definitely something you feel\nas you're working in Illustrator.\n\n119\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.069\nAs I'm moving it is trying to snap\nto each of these guide points.\n\n120\n00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.192\nSo if you are using your guides,\nI would definitely recommend turning on,\n\n121\n00:05:32.192 --> 00:05:34.080\nI'm sorry, using your guides.\n\n122\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.364\nIf you're using your grids,\nI would definitely recommended\n\n123\n00:05:37.364 --> 00:05:40.719\nturning on that Snap to Grid,\nI'm not gonna say guide, grid.\n\n124\n00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:45.490\n[LAUGH] And use that Snap to Grid as\na way of just kinda making it a little\n\n125\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.510\nbit more intuitive for you.\n\n126\n00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.046\nIf you're gonna use your grids anyway,\n\n127\n00:05:49.046 --> 00:05:51.224\nI kinda feel like you may as\nwell turn on your Snap to Grid.\n\n128\n00:05:51.224 --> 00:05:53.378\nNow, the thing that can get\na little bit tricky about this, and\n\n129\n00:05:53.378 --> 00:05:55.190\nwe were kinda discussing this earlier.\n\n130\n00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.428\nSay I go ahead and hide my grid and I just\nkinda forget that I have that on, right?\n\n131\n00:06:00.428 --> 00:06:03.910\nAnd I forget that I was even\nusing the grid at one point,\n\n132\n00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.930\njust cuz I'm hiding my grid doesn't\nnecessarily mean the Snap to Grid is off.\n\n133\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.504\nSo this is still snapping,\nwhether or not you can see the grid,\n\n134\n00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:14.538\nit's still snapping to that grid.\n\n135\n00:06:14.538 --> 00:06:18.961\nSo if that something that you want,\ngreat, if you don't want it, go ahead and\n\n136\n00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:20.910\nturn to your View menu again.\n\n137\n00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.385\nOops, and\nmake sure to turn off that Snap to Grid.\n\n138\n00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:27.631\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and unselect that.\n\n139\n00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:32.548\n&gt;&gt; I use the grid a lot, and I also use\nthe Snap to Grid, but like you're saying,\n\n140\n00:06:32.548 --> 00:06:37.392\nI toggle back and forth of hiding and\nshowing the grid, and then snapping and\n\n141\n00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:39.080\nnot snapping to the grid.\n\n142\n00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.010\nSo those keyboard shortcuts that\nare to the right of each one\n\n143\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.657\nof those commands in that View menu,\nthose are committed to memory to me.\n\n144\n00:06:45.657 --> 00:06:46.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n145\n00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:49.246\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it's been a while so\nI probably have to remind myself.\n\n146\n00:06:49.246 --> 00:06:53.123\nBut when I'm deep in projects like this,\nI'm all the time on and off,\n\n147\n00:06:53.123 --> 00:06:57.780\nusing the grids, hiding the grids,\nturning on the guides, hiding the guides.\n\n148\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.679\nAll that kind of stuff, and going back and\nforth between all of them to make\n\n149\n00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:07.836\nsure that it is as accurate as I need it\nto be, and I didn't wanna say perfect.\n\n150\n00:07:07.836 --> 00:07:08.967\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n151\n00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:11.307\n&gt;&gt; How can I not say,\nit's perfectly aligned?\n\n152\n00:07:11.307 --> 00:07:12.804\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n153\n00:07:12.804 --> 00:07:14.554\n[LAUGH] It's tough actually.\n\n154\n00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:15.085\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n155\n00:07:15.085 --> 00:07:18.263\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH], apparently I\ndon't have a lot of descriptions.\n\n156\n00:07:18.263 --> 00:07:20.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n157\n00:07:20.278 --> 00:07:22.676\none other thing I wanted to point out,\nor actually,\n\n158\n00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:25.710\nreally two other things that I\nwanted to point out with our grids.\n\n159\n00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.592\nOne, this isn't necessarily\ndirectly related to our grids, but\n\n160\n00:07:29.592 --> 00:07:32.585\nI think it kind of comes up\nwith that snap to option.\n\n161\n00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.270\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a second object here.\n\n162\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.106\nThey don't necessarily have to be\ndifferent colors, but just for\n\n163\n00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:41.078\nfun's sake we'll go ahead and\nmake them different colors.\n\n164\n00:07:41.078 --> 00:07:42.870\nAnd then I'm gonna go\nback to that View menu.\n\n165\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.134\nYou also may have noticed that there\nwere several different options.\n\n166\n00:07:45.134 --> 00:07:47.988\nSnap to Pixel,\nwe'll kind of talk about that, again,\n\n167\n00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:51.340\nwhen we get into our more saving for\nweb, things like that.\n\n168\n00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.373\nBut then there's also a Snap to Point.\n\n169\n00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:58.220\nNow, Snap to Point versus Snap to Grid,\nit's kind of a subtle difference,\n\n170\n00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.490\nI would say.\n\n171\n00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.219\nBut the Snap to Point, basically,\n\n172\n00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:03.764\nit's gonna help you kinda\nalign objects together.\n\n173\n00:08:03.764 --> 00:08:08.186\nSo, for instance if I wanna kinda\nalign this corners together it's\n\n174\n00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:12.698\nbasically just gonna snap the two\npoints of those objects together.\n\n175\n00:08:12.698 --> 00:08:16.986\nSo really just depends on your own\npersonal preference, I would say.\n\n176\n00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:18.061\n&gt;&gt; And I think this is on by default.\n\n177\n00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:18.791\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n178\n00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:23.683\n&gt;&gt; The Snap to Point, and you might\nhave noticed as you've been going along,\n\n179\n00:08:23.683 --> 00:08:26.324\nthe two squares will kind of magnetize or\n\n180\n00:08:26.324 --> 00:08:30.454\nmagnetically snap together when\nthey get close to each other.\n\n181\n00:08:30.454 --> 00:08:34.563\nOr even with using the smart guides\nwhere it kind of, it snaps in,\n\n182\n00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:36.073\nthat's on by default.\n\n183\n00:08:36.073 --> 00:08:41.299\nSo if you didn't want any of that, I've\nturned that off every once in a while.\n\n184\n00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.489\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n185\n00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:48.040\n&gt;&gt; But it is different to the objects\nto each other, if you wanna say,\n\n186\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.811\nnot to a grid or a guide, it's all\nthe objects as their own entities.\n\n187\n00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:55.683\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, and I like them magnetized.\n\n188\n00:08:55.683 --> 00:08:56.885\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n189\n00:08:56.885 --> 00:08:59.975\nthat's basically what it's doing,\nit's kinda just pulling the two together.\n\n190\n00:08:59.975 --> 00:09:03.431\nAnd you kinda like she said,\nI very rarely turn this off,\n\n191\n00:09:03.431 --> 00:09:07.031\nI just kind of leave it there,\ncuz I do find it to be helpful.\n\n192\n00:09:07.031 --> 00:09:09.718\nBut occasionally,\nyou have something that keeps snapping and\n\n193\n00:09:09.718 --> 00:09:12.670\nyour like please stop snapping,\nit's driving me crazy.\n\n194\n00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.272\nAnd you can go ahead and just go to your\nView menu, and go ahead and unselect that.\n\n195\n00:09:16.272 --> 00:09:19.466\nNow with that grid, there was one\nother thing that I pointed out,\n\n196\n00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:23.380\ncuz we just kind of naturally\nwanna get in to pixels with this.\n\n197\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.369\nIf you do wanna see kind of\na pixel grid or a pixel preview,\n\n198\n00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:29.935\nwhat you're gonna do is,\nyou're gonna need to zoom in really far.\n\n199\n00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:32.878\nSo you're gonna need to zoom in past 600%,\n\n200\n00:09:32.878 --> 00:09:36.350\nand that's what's gonna show\nyou your pixel preview.\n\n201\n00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.163\nAgain, I think that's another thing you\ncan adjust in your preferences if you\n\n202\n00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.260\nwanna see it earlier or\nlater in your zoom.\n\n203\n00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.050\nBut I can go here,\njust using your typically zooming method.\n\n204\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.596\nSo I'm just gonna use a Cmd or\nCtrl+, and zoom in really far.\n\n205\n00:09:49.596 --> 00:09:53.500\nMaybe I'll space over here so\nyou can actually start to see it.\n\n206\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.888\nMay not be coming up with the resolution\nof my screen I think, but it is something\n\n207\n00:09:57.888 --> 00:10:02.491\nthat you would typically see, you would\nstart to pull up, past 600%, a grid.\n\n208\n00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:05.391\nApparently, I'm just not giving you\na very good example of that, but\n\n209\n00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:07.960\n[LAUGH] probably something that\nyou are seeing on your screen.\n\n210\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.132\nSo, I did wanna mention that with that.\n\n211\n00:10:10.132 --> 00:10:15.420\nNow, I said earlier we were going\nto go back to these little guys.\n\n212\n00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.086\nSo if you watch the aligning\nobjects part one episode,\n\n213\n00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:21.647\nI was gonna test Illustrator on this.\n\n214\n00:10:21.647 --> 00:10:26.081\nSo we said, okay, in our aligning objects,\nusing that distribute option,\n\n215\n00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:30.330\nwe said that we wanted this to be exactly\nhalf an inch away from each other.\n\n216\n00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.133\nNow, how can I actually measure\nsomething in Illustrator and\n\n217\n00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:38.608\nmake sure that this is gonna be exactly\nhalf an inch away from each other?\n\n218\n00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:43.281\nNotice I used the word measure,\nwe're going to hop into our Measure tool,\n\n219\n00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:47.940\nso our Measure tool is hidden\nunderneath that Eye-Dropper tool.\n\n220\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.268\nSo I'm gonna click and\nhold on the Eye-Dropper, and\n\n221\n00:10:50.268 --> 00:10:51.571\nI'm gonna grab the Measure.\n\n222\n00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:55.350\nIt looks like a little ruler,\nwhich is kinda cute.\n\n223\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.301\nAnd what I can do to measure\nthe distance between points,\n\n224\n00:10:58.301 --> 00:11:01.018\nI'm just gonna click hold and\ndrag between the two.\n\n225\n00:11:01.018 --> 00:11:04.340\nSo something you may wanna do is hold\ndown your Shift key to make sure you have\n\n226\n00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.607\na perfectly straight line,\n\n227\n00:11:05.607 --> 00:11:08.780\ncuz otherwise that can kinda\nstart to impact your measure.\n\n228\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.609\nSo I'm gonna hold down my Shift key,\nclick, hold, and drag.\n\n229\n00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:14.225\nAnd what that's gonna pull up for\n\n230\n00:11:14.225 --> 00:11:16.890\nme is it's automatically\ngonna pull up my info panel.\n\n231\n00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.176\nNow I've let go of my mouse, so\nyou don't have to keep holding.\n\n232\n00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:22.557\nAnd what you'll see,\nthe width of that line was half an inch,\n\n233\n00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.230\nwhich is exactly what I\ntold Illustrator to do.\n\n234\n00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.366\nSo unless they're lying to me twice,\n\n235\n00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:29.983\nI know that this is exactly\nhalf an inch apart.\n\n236\n00:11:29.983 --> 00:11:33.158\nAgain, this all will natively\npull up your Info panel so\n\n237\n00:11:33.158 --> 00:11:36.215\nyou can see kind of some\nother information with that.\n\n238\n00:11:36.215 --> 00:11:40.567\nBut you can too, any time you need to see\nthe distance between two objects, like\n\n239\n00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:45.190\nthat's 5.841, but it's probably because\nI just dragged my line a little too far.\n\n240\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.739\nIt's probably close enough,\nand with that just-\n\n241\n00:11:47.739 --> 00:11:48.371\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n242\n00:11:48.371 --> 00:11:49.325\n&gt;&gt; You go ahead, yeah.\n\n243\n00:11:49.325 --> 00:11:52.720\n&gt;&gt; I raised my hand over here\nbecause it was just a natural,\n\n244\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.246\nhey, I have a question.\n\n245\n00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:57.788\nDoes it automatically snap\nto that edge of screen?\n\n246\n00:11:57.788 --> 00:11:58.510\nIt doesn't, does it?\n\n247\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.158\n&gt;&gt; No, it does not.\n\n248\n00:11:59.158 --> 00:12:02.342\nWhich is what the issue was that I had\nwith the one being slightly larger.\n\n249\n00:12:02.342 --> 00:12:03.219\nI'm glad that you pointed that out, yeah.\n\n250\n00:12:03.219 --> 00:12:07.668\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where this tool,\nI've used it before but\n\n251\n00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:13.091\nI can't get that pin point accuracy,\nam I right on the edge of the square.\n\n252\n00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:20.809\nAnd so I was asking if they actually did\nthat in this iteration of the CC product.\n\n253\n00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:21.795\nThey haven't done that?\n\n254\n00:12:21.795 --> 00:12:26.837\nOkay, well then I'll use it, but\nit's really more of, a am I close enough?\n\n255\n00:12:26.837 --> 00:12:28.184\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n256\n00:12:28.184 --> 00:12:29.733\n&gt;&gt; To half of an inch.\n\n257\n00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:32.635\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kind of basically,\nI mean, honestly,\n\n258\n00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:35.782\nI don't even really use it that often,\nbut if it's, okay,\n\n259\n00:12:35.782 --> 00:12:39.520\nthat's probably actually it and\nI just drew a little bit too far.\n\n260\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.080\nAnd I also just wanted to point out,\njust for fun's sake,\n\n261\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.182\nit kinda pulls up your\nNavigator panel as well.\n\n262\n00:12:44.182 --> 00:12:49.010\nYour Navigator panel, just natively for\nme, always comes up with my Illustrator,\n\n263\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.360\nmy Info panel.\n\n264\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.804\nAnd that just kinda lets you know where\neverything is in your work space,\n\n265\n00:12:53.804 --> 00:12:56.582\nwhere all of your objects are,\nif you're losing things.\n\n266\n00:12:56.582 --> 00:13:00.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is one of those things\nif you read any of the tutorial guides, or\n\n267\n00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.638\nclassroom in a book, or anything, they're\nalways talking about the Navigator Panel.\n\n268\n00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:09.849\nThere's some cute little things about it,\npersonally I never use this panel.\n\n269\n00:13:09.849 --> 00:13:10.878\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n270\n00:13:10.878 --> 00:13:11.401\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n271\n00:13:11.401 --> 00:13:14.047\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I always use all of our zooms,\n\n272\n00:13:14.047 --> 00:13:16.989\nall of our shortcuts and\neverything like that.\n\n273\n00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:21.166\nTo me this is more steps\nneeded to get me around-\n\n274\n00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:21.778\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n275\n00:13:21.778 --> 00:13:26.820\n&gt;&gt; Than mastering all of my zooms,\nand the toggles of the hand tool and\n\n276\n00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.894\neverything like that, so it's there.\n\n277\n00:13:29.894 --> 00:13:31.014\nI don't use it, I just wanted to ask you.\n\n278\n00:13:31.014 --> 00:13:31.971\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You don't use it either?\n\n279\n00:13:31.971 --> 00:13:32.952\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n280\n00:13:32.952 --> 00:13:34.973\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Never, the only reason I mentioned it,\n\n281\n00:13:34.973 --> 00:13:36.747\nI was sitting here and\nI was like, well, it's there.\n\n282\n00:13:36.747 --> 00:13:37.269\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n283\n00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:39.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Throw it out there.\n\n284\n00:13:39.308 --> 00:13:40.290\n&gt;&gt; You're like, what does that do?\n\n285\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:40.975\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n286\n00:13:40.975 --> 00:13:41.698\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell ya.\n\n287\n00:13:41.698 --> 00:13:44.330\n&gt;&gt; In case anybody was pulling it up and\nthey saw, like me,\n\n288\n00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.180\nit always comes up with the Info panel.\n\n289\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.149\nIn case you just wanted to know,\nthat's basically what it's there for.\n\n290\n00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:52.950\nSo we'll go ahead and\nmove on into Outline.\n\n291\n00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:59.504\nSo now that we know how to measure,\noutline mode or viewing outlines rather.\n\n292\n00:13:59.504 --> 00:14:01.788\nThis is one of those things that I think,\nagain,\n\n293\n00:14:01.788 --> 00:14:05.190\nyou may not necessarily realize\nthe value of straight away.\n\n294\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.791\nBut where it comes in handy, so let's say\nI'm working on a bunch of objects, or\n\n295\n00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:12.691\na couple objects that\nare really close together.\n\n296\n00:14:12.691 --> 00:14:15.469\nAnd I'm having a hard time\nkind of aligning things and\n\n297\n00:14:15.469 --> 00:14:17.950\njust really seeing where things start and\nend.\n\n298\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.444\nI know this seems like a very basic\nexample and you're like, Emily,\n\n299\n00:14:20.444 --> 00:14:23.328\ncan you really not see where those things\nstart and end, it's pretty obvious.\n\n300\n00:14:23.328 --> 00:14:26.694\nBut when you start, especially if\nyou're drawing something with a pen,\n\n301\n00:14:26.694 --> 00:14:29.310\nyou've got some more\nintricate details in there.\n\n302\n00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.253\nSometimes it can be really hard to see,\nokay, where does one path start and\n\n303\n00:14:32.253 --> 00:14:33.435\nwhere does another path end?\n\n304\n00:14:33.435 --> 00:14:34.668\nEspecially you can say, okay,\n\n305\n00:14:34.668 --> 00:14:37.480\nif they were the same color or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n306\n00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.681\nSo what sometimes comes in handy for\nthat is viewing something in Outline mode.\n\n307\n00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:45.990\nOutline mode is just gonna let you\nsee exactly where the paths are.\n\n308\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.921\nNow, it's probably gonna\nkinda freak you out at first.\n\n309\n00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:53.690\nSo what we're gonna do, we're gonna go to\nView, and then Outline, Cmd or Ctrl+Y.\n\n310\n00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.342\nAnd it's basically just gonna be,\nwhat just happened to my Work Space?\n\n311\n00:14:57.342 --> 00:15:01.978\nEverything just kind of goes\ninto this very basic just\n\n312\n00:15:01.978 --> 00:15:05.696\noutlines of exactly where your paths are.\n\n313\n00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:07.378\n&gt;&gt; It's like a wire mesh,\nif you wanna say.\n\n314\n00:15:07.378 --> 00:15:08.103\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n315\n00:15:08.103 --> 00:15:09.836\n&gt;&gt; Of where everything is.\n\n316\n00:15:09.836 --> 00:15:12.925\nAnd it's funny when you're like,\nwhere did I go?\n\n317\n00:15:12.925 --> 00:15:15.441\nAnd then people go and select,\ncuz you can still select a square.\n\n318\n00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:16.915\n&gt;&gt; You can still move, yeah.\n\n319\n00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:21.667\n&gt;&gt; And then you go up and do a fill,\nwhy is it not filling in green, or\n\n320\n00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:25.808\nwhat have you, and\nit's you're in Outline mode.\n\n321\n00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:29.127\nAnd a lot of people get here by mistake.\n\n322\n00:15:29.127 --> 00:15:33.099\nBecause if you notice\nthe shortcut is Cmd or Ctrl+Y.\n\n323\n00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:36.657\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Which is, in a Microsoft product,\n\n324\n00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:39.727\nCtrl+Z is undo, Ctrl+Y is redo.\n\n325\n00:15:39.727 --> 00:15:41.758\nSo if you have that-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n326\n00:15:41.758 --> 00:15:46.720\nif you have that mapped in your head\nthat redo is Ctrl+Y you get into here,\n\n327\n00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.700\nand then you Ctrl+Z and you can't get out.\n\n328\n00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.716\n&gt;&gt; And then you're like, what's happening?\n\n329\n00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:54.591\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz you're in a different mode,\n\n330\n00:15:54.591 --> 00:16:00.389\nand then I've had people calling me\nin a panic, I don't know what to do.\n\n331\n00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:02.194\nAnd I'm, check your Outline mode,\nand they're like, that?\n\n332\n00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:04.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n333\n00:16:04.739 --> 00:16:06.793\nbe a little careful of the shortcuts.\n\n334\n00:16:06.793 --> 00:16:09.889\nAnd redo in here is the Ctrl+ Shift+Z.\n\n335\n00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:10.612\nAm I right?\n\n336\n00:16:10.612 --> 00:16:11.295\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n337\n00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:16.631\nAnd also another handy tip that I\nuse all the time, Ctrl+ Shift+Z.\n\n338\n00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:19.334\nYeah, it's one of those\nthings that a lot of times,\n\n339\n00:16:19.334 --> 00:16:23.030\nmaybe not quite the frantic calls\nat midnight like she's describing.\n\n340\n00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.824\nI'll definitely have students come to me,\nand be like,\n\n341\n00:16:25.824 --> 00:16:27.990\nI can't select a color, what's going on?\n\n342\n00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.530\nAnd it's just cuz you're in Outline mode.\n\n343\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:33.664\nSo, does come in handy, again,\njust depending on the situation,\n\n344\n00:16:33.664 --> 00:16:35.411\ngot a lot of things going on.\n\n345\n00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:39.074\nSometimes it's helpful just to be, you\nknow what, I need to take a step back and\n\n346\n00:16:39.074 --> 00:16:40.287\njust look at those paths.\n\n347\n00:16:40.287 --> 00:16:43.688\nSo certainly, I think falls\ninto the category of aligning.\n\n348\n00:16:43.688 --> 00:16:47.675\nTo kind of wrap things up here, so\nwe kinda had all of those align tools,\n\n349\n00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:50.346\nand then I think all of the grids and\nthe guides.\n\n350\n00:16:50.346 --> 00:16:53.925\nAnd all that fun stuff that goes with us\nis certainly helping us to meet that end\n\n351\n00:16:53.925 --> 00:16:57.581\nof making sure that everything is gonna\nbe perfectly aligned in Illustrator.\n\n352\n00:16:57.581 --> 00:17:02.389\nOr not perfectly, but, perfectly makes\nit pixel perfect sounding, but yes,\n\n353\n00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:04.345\nperfect aligned as you want it.\n\n354\n00:17:04.345 --> 00:17:05.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n355\n00:17:05.228 --> 00:17:06.066\n&gt;&gt; You get what I'm saying.\n\n356\n00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.250\n&gt;&gt; Good enough, right?\n\n357\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.323\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:17:08.323 --> 00:17:10.830\n&gt;&gt; As long as it's what you want close\n\n359\n00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.564\nenough, we're good.\n\n360\n00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.583\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n361\n00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:15.854\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good, but you know what,\n\n362\n00:17:15.854 --> 00:17:18.053\nnow we're starting to try to figure\nout what words to talk about.\n\n363\n00:17:18.053 --> 00:17:21.799\nSo that might be a key point to say,\nhey, we should probably stop talking.\n\n364\n00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:22.474\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n365\n00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:23.819\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n366\n00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.723\n&gt;&gt; That was a great introduction to\n\n367\n00:17:25.723 --> 00:17:29.107\neverything we need to do with our lines,\nand guides, and\n\n368\n00:17:29.107 --> 00:17:32.085\ngrids, as a designer,\nyou use them all the time.\n\n369\n00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:35.758\nAnd map those shortcuts in you brain,\nit will definitely help you.\n\n370\n00:17:35.758 --> 00:17:39.331\nSo that's about it,\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n371\n00:17:39.331 --> 00:17:42.223\nSigning off for CreativeProTV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n372\n00:17:42.223 --> 00:17:43.116\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n373\n00:17:43.116 --> 00:17:44.390\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n374\n00:17:44.390 -->

another\nexciting addition of CreativeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.916\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\nthis is Illustrator CC 2017, and\n\n5\n00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:22.960\nwe are talking all about effects today.\n\n6\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.014\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n7\n00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:26.720\nAnd here to help us is Ms.\nEmily Ramsey, hi.\n\n8\n00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.457\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna be having\nsome fun with effects and\n\n9\n00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:33.579\nthat shoulder shimmy it just has to come\nout when we're talking about effects.\n\n10\n00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.819\nSo yeah, now I'm excited,\nwe're gonna do lots of cool stuff,\n\n11\n00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:39.700\nIllustrator style effects,\nPhotoshop style effects.\n\n12\n00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.730\nWe're gonna talk about editing,\nwhich is slightly different than actually\n\n13\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.008\napplying effect, and then maybe getting\nsome 3D stuff if we're feeling crazy.\n\n14\n00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:52.247\nSo one thing I wanna point out that this\nis slightly different from those text\n\n15\n00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:52.852\neffects.\n\n16\n00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:56.461\nIf you watched that episode, those were\nthings that you could do specifically to\n\n17\n00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:58.810\ntext, these we're really\nworking on are objects.\n\n18\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.980\nSo I think you'll figure it out, but\n\n19\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.760\njust because we're using the word effect\nagain, I just want you to see it's gonna\n\n20\n00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.340\nbe pretty different from\nwhat we talked about there.\n\n21\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.858\nSo we'll go ahead and jump in here,\nyou see cat is back, so\n\n22\n00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:17.778\n[LAUGH] if you watched the placing\nimages episode you'll see, we met Ollie.\n\n23\n00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:20.658\nAnd Ollie is making a comeback here,\nbecause I want to\n\n24\n00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:25.010\nshow something with different styles of\neffects that you can do in Illustrator.\n\n25\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.170\nSo I have Ollie,\nwhich is basically just an image, so\n\n26\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.210\nI'm working on a raster\nImage there versus a vector.\n\n27\n00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.866\nSo I just wanna show you real quickly,\nparticularly when we look at our Photoshop\n\n28\n00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:44.354\nstyle effects, how that's gonna look\ndifferent on a vector versus a raster,\n\n29\n00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:48.283\nif I can get those words to\ncome out of my mouth properly.\n\n30\n00:01:48.283 --> 00:01:53.440\nSo what we're gonna do here,\nlet me go ahead and select my cat man.\n\n31\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.200\nYou use whatever you wanna use.\n\n32\n00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.584\nYou're more of a dog person, I understand.\n\n33\n00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.640\nAnd then I'm gonna go\ninto my Effect menu here.\n\n34\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.360\nAnd you'll see, I mentioned,\nokay, Illustrator effects versus\n\n35\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.480\nPhotoshop style effects, and you're\nprobably going, what does that mean?\n\n36\n00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.174\nHere, it's pretty clearly listed for\nus, okay,\n\n37\n00:02:09.174 --> 00:02:11.564\nIllustrator effects, Photoshop effects.\n\n38\n00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:16.070\nSo I'm really gonna go through\nthese in a tremendous detail.\n\n39\n00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.874\nI think if I go through each one of them\nyou will see like if I go over artistic,\n\n40\n00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:23.154\nthey are like a million different\noptions that I can choose from.\n\n41\n00:02:23.154 --> 00:02:27.036\nWe're not gonna go through each of\nindividually but if I just kinda show you,\n\n42\n00:02:27.036 --> 00:02:29.199\nokay artistic and then grab color pencil.\n\n43\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.834\nWhat that's gonna kinda pull up here,\nit pull up just like dialog box that's\n\n44\n00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:37.218\ntotally different from really anything\nthat you actually see in illustrator,\n\n45\n00:02:37.218 --> 00:02:37.789\notherwise.\n\n46\n00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:39.490\nAnd it's funny.\n\n47\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unless you're a Photoshop person.\n\n48\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.419\nAnd then you're like, I'm home.\n\n49\n00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:44.502\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:48.084\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because this is the exact same\nthing that happens in Photoshop and\n\n51\n00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:50.210\nthey're almost the exact same names.\n\n52\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.374\nAnd, well they are.\n\n53\n00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:54.940\nThey're the same filters or effects.\n\n54\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.870\nNow I'm thinking,\nlike what are they in Photoshop?\n\n55\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.690\nBut they're the same things.\n\n56\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.181\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n&gt;&gt; And you can go through all of them and\n\n57\n00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:03.826\nagain, raster versus the vector\nmakes kind of a big difference\n\n58\n00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:07.138\nwhen you're talking about\nthis particular effects.\n\n59\n00:03:07.138 --> 00:03:08.225\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n60\n00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:08.808\nSo we can see,\n\n61\n00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:11.877\nokay, it gives you kind of a preview\nwhat's happening to my cat over here.\n\n62\n00:03:11.877 --> 00:03:14.669\nAnd I can kinda zoom out\nif you look in the bottom,\n\n63\n00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.710\nthat's in the corner of this\ndialog box like [SOUND].\n\n64\n00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.868\n&gt;&gt; Aww, that looks like a nice, colored\npainting that you can hang on the wall.\n\n65\n00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:24.037\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I paid big money for\n\n66\n00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:24.927\nthis basically-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n67\n00:03:24.927 --> 00:03:26.123\n&gt;&gt; Is what she's saying.\n\n68\n00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:26.960\nSo yeah, I'm gonna take this.\n\n69\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.073\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll hang it on my wall.\n\n70\n00:03:29.073 --> 00:03:30.800\nAll right, go ahead and hit OK.\n\n71\n00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.945\nOllie would be so proud.\n\n72\n00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.560\nAnd you can kinda see, okay,\nI can mess with this you.\n\n73\n00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.593\nThere are other things I can do.\n\n74\n00:03:35.593 --> 00:03:39.449\nYou can kinda filter through everything so\neven if you're like, okay I actually don't\n\n75\n00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.060\nlike colored pencil, I wanna go switch\nto something else, you have that option.\n\n76\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.800\nSo you can kind of adjust these\nsettings to your heart's content.\n\n77\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.720\nI'm just pointing out that it's there.\n\n78\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.813\nSo I can go ahead and hit OK.\n\n79\n00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:51.032\nit's definitely gonna be one of\nthose things that's like it's gonna\n\n80\n00:03:51.032 --> 00:03:51.716\nkinda take a minute.\n\n81\n00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:54.510\nAnd there we can see how\nthat impacted my image.\n\n82\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.380\nNow that was a raster based image, right?\n\n83\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.650\nSo we went ahead and placed that in there.\n\n84\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.690\nWhat happens when we try and\napply the same thing to a vector?\n\n85\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.270\nEspecially depending on\nwhich one you choose,\n\n86\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.490\nI'm just picking colored\npencil pretty randomly here.\n\n87\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.550\nSometimes you're gonna see more of\nan effect, sometimes you're not.\n\n88\n00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.304\nSo you see ,you can go ahead and\ndo that vector there.\n\n89\n00:04:13.304 --> 00:04:16.975\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and hit OK, just so\nwe can see the exact same effect with\n\n90\n00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:20.380\nthe exact same settings, how it kind\nof impacted one versus the other.\n\n91\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.290\nOkay, so basically you just\nmade it gray with a very\n\n92\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.090\nthin orange stroke applied to it.\n\n93\n00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.158\nSo definitely if you're using\nthose Photoshop style effects,\n\n94\n00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:33.125\nprobably gonna be something that\nyou want to apply to a photo.\n\n95\n00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:36.281\nBut technically you can,\nIllustrator's not gonna stop you.\n\n96\n00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.513\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:37.513 --> 00:04:40.940\nmove Ollie off to the side cuz I wanna\nshow something with an image later.\n\n98\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.180\nBut for now, just gonna go ahead and\nkinda clear this out, and\n\n99\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.560\nwe're gonna get into some of\nthose Illustrator effects, so\n\n100\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.530\nthese are where it kinda\ngets a little fun.\n\n101\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.710\nSo, I'm gonna go back into my Effect menu.\n\n102\n00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.091\nThere are a couple ones that we're gonna\ndiscuss today, a couple ones that we're\n\n103\n00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:59.388\ngonna discuss in other episodes, like\nPathfinders, kind of off on their own.\n\n104\n00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:02.750\nWe're gonna do things like\nWarp in a different episode.\n\n105\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.280\nBut if I look at specifically,\nI think we'll start with Distort and\n\n106\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.010\nTransform, it's a fun one.\n\n107\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.334\nWhat we can do, we can go ahead and select\nthis, Effect &gt; Distort and Transform.\n\n108\n00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:14.900\nAnd then I'm just gonna go ahead and\npick one at random.\n\n109\n00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.760\nSo maybe I'll pick Pucker and Bloat,\ncuz that's a fun thing to say, Pucker.\n\n110\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.303\nAnd go ahead and hit OK.\n\n111\n00:05:21.303 --> 00:05:22.761\nNow note I had that shape selected, so\n\n112\n00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:24.548\nthat's one thing you\nwanna pay attention to.\n\n113\n00:05:24.548 --> 00:05:26.920\nBefore I did anything,\nI had this shape selected.\n\n114\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.980\nEffect &gt; Distort and\nTransform &gt; Pucker and Bloat.\n\n115\n00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.082\nTurn on my preview button here just we can\nkinda get an idea of what this looks like\n\n116\n00:05:34.082 --> 00:05:37.470\nand it's whoa, if I pucker,\nwhoa I get that kind of crazy thing.\n\n117\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.655\nAnd the cool thing about these, especially\nthese Distort and Transform options that\n\n118\n00:05:41.655 --> 00:05:45.372\nyou have, I feel like it's one of things\nwhere people think that if they want\n\n119\n00:05:45.372 --> 00:05:48.738\nsomething that looks like this,\nthey have to draw with the pen tool or\n\n120\n00:05:48.738 --> 00:05:50.919\ntake their wide arrow and\nadjust to square.\n\n121\n00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.694\nIllustrator can do that so\nmuch more easily for you.\n\n122\n00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:58.300\nYou just have to know where to look,\nreally, so and kinda what to do.\n\n123\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.215\nSo I can take that, maybe I want\nto do something else to this or\n\n124\n00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.860\nmaybe I wanted to just kinda\nleave that off to the side.\n\n125\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.688\nI'll show you an example of another one,\nI go to that Effect menu &gt; Distort and\n\n126\n00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:08.329\nTransform.\n\n127\n00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:12.614\nAnd then you know maybe try,\none of my personal favorites is\n\n128\n00:06:12.614 --> 00:06:16.740\nthe Zig Zag option and\nI can turn in on that preview again.\n\n129\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.024\nAnd you can see okay,\nI can make several different zig zags,\n\n130\n00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:23.215\nor increase that size rather.\n\n131\n00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:27.990\nAnd then choose that ridges per segment\nand say, okay, I wanna have a lot there.\n\n132\n00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.714\nOr I don't know why but\nI just love doing this as the example.\n\n133\n00:06:30.714 --> 00:06:33.655\nI can go ahead and change that corner\nfrom like a really hard edge to\n\n134\n00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:35.940\nsomething that's a little more smooth.\n\n135\n00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.770\nAnd I actually think it\nlooks like a little splat.\n\n136\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.950\nAnd I think it's fun.\n\n137\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.175\nSo you can go ahead and\nchoose to your heart's content,\n\n138\n00:06:43.175 --> 00:06:47.400\nkinda play around with these a little\nbit until you kinda see what you like.\n\n139\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.730\nSo that's definitely\nan option available to you.\n\n140\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.830\nWe'll even pull up one more just for fun's\nsake so we can see what it looks like.\n\n141\n00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.230\nIf I take this Effect, and\nthen Distort and Transform and\n\n142\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.090\nmaybe try Tweak,\nthat's what I'm hovering over.\n\n143\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.248\nTweak isn't one that I use very often but,\nyeah, why not?\n\n144\n00:07:08.248 --> 00:07:09.615\nSo you can kinda see what happens there.\n\n145\n00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:12.475\nAnd again, kinda similar to those\nPhotoshop style effects, just\n\n146\n00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:15.425\nkind of roll through each of them and you\ncan kind of see what each of them does.\n\n147\n00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:17.465\nBut knowing that they're there, and\n\n148\n00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:21.255\nknowing that I could make something like\nthis without having to use my pen tool and\n\n149\n00:07:21.255 --> 00:07:25.015\nmy white arrow tool,\ncan be a tremendous time saver.\n\n150\n00:07:25.015 --> 00:07:27.810\nSo that's definitely something\nthat I wanna pay attention to.\n\n151\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.585\nNow I want to kinda keep all these here\ncuz that'll kinda show us something later.\n\n152\n00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:36.480\nOr I'll maybe even do\nthe next thing on this.\n\n153\n00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.492\nSo I'm gonna take or grab maybe this one,\nand here's what we're gonna do.\n\n154\n00:07:40.492 --> 00:07:42.190\nWe're gonna go back into\nour Effect menu and\n\n155\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.800\nI want to talk about\na different style of effect.\n\n156\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.328\nAnd I'm using the word style here\nappropriately cuz it's actually gonna be\n\n157\n00:07:49.328 --> 00:07:51.173\nunder our Stylized category.\n\n158\n00:07:51.173 --> 00:07:54.850\nThese maybe some of the effects that\nyou're kind of thinking of when you think\n\n159\n00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.808\nof working with effects on objects or pass\nYour drop shadow, your inner glow, your\n\n160\n00:07:58.808 --> 00:08:02.714\nouter glow, these are gonna be things that\nyou see across all platforms in Adobe,\n\n161\n00:08:02.714 --> 00:08:06.393\nit's things that you can do a Photoshop,\nthings that you can do in Indesign,\n\n162\n00:08:06.393 --> 00:08:08.544\nmaybe not Scribble or\nsomething like that but\n\n163\n00:08:08.544 --> 00:08:12.610\na drop shadow is a pretty common thing,\nyou can do that with code likewise.\n\n164\n00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:17.460\nSo I can go ahead and\neffect style as drop shadow and go ahead,\n\n165\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.220\nand again, I'm gonna turn on my preview.\n\n166\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.090\nAnd you'll see with just\nthe default settings,\n\n167\n00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.560\nthat's what's gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n168\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.990\nNow, in a professional scenario,\nthat's probably not what I would use.\n\n169\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.740\nI probably wouldn't use\nthe default settings.\n\n170\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.320\nBut I wanna go ahead and just leave\nthat like that so that now I can and\n\n171\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.040\nshow you how to change your effects so\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit OK here.\n\n172\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.822\nIf I wanted to go back to my effects\nstylized, I wanted to apply an inner glow,\n\n173\n00:08:40.822 --> 00:08:42.710\nsomething like that, by all means.\n\n174\n00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.150\nAn inner glow is just gonna\nbe a glow on the inside.\n\n175\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.850\nAn outer glow is gonna be kind\nof a glow on the outside.\n\n176\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.440\nAnd again, just kinda play around with it,\nsee what each of them does.\n\n177\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.310\nI don't need to go through each\nof them individually for you.\n\n178\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.770\nYou can kinda do that on your own time.\n\n179\n00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.390\nOtherwise we'd be here for hours,\nand I know you don't wanna do that.\n\n180\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.525\nSo no one wants to listen to me for hours.\n\n181\n00:09:00.525 --> 00:09:03.520\n[LAUGH] So we can go ahead and\nkinda leave that at that, and\n\n182\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.350\nthen now what I wanna look\nat I love this drop shadow.\n\n183\n00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.550\nThat's probably not something, you know,\nI maybe wouldn't do something so harsh.\n\n184\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.752\nIf I go to Effect, and I go to Stylize,\nand I go to Drop Shadow,\n\n185\n00:09:14.752 --> 00:09:19.330\nsay I'm thinking I'm going to go ahead and\nedit that there, what's going to happen?\n\n186\n00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.090\nWe get this dialogue box come up.\n\n187\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.230\nThis will apply another\ninstance of effect.\n\n188\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.090\nIf you were to edit the current effect,\ndouble click the name of the effect in\n\n189\n00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.030\nthe Appearance panel so\nit's like what does that mean?\n\n190\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.170\nTelling me to go to my Appearance panel.\n\n191\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.460\n&gt;&gt; It's nice of them\ngiving you that warning.\n\n192\n00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.250\nThat wasnt always there.\n\n193\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.210\nI'm glad they just said,\nhey, just letting you know,\n\n194\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.470\nthis might be what you want to do,\nso apply another drop shadow.\n\n195\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.130\nBut if you don't let me\nshow you where to go.\n\n196\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:51.030\nI think that was another win in\nthe Adobe column of good job\n\n197\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.700\nmake sure you give us that warning.\n\n198\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it steals my thunder but\n\n199\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.380\nit does help you out if you go ahead and\ngive that warning.\n\n200\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.100\nSo what are we gonna do we're gonna go\nahead and grab our appearance panel.\n\n201\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.930\nOur Appearance panel is awesome.\n\n202\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.360\nIt basically just going to\nbe where you're going to see\n\n203\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.660\nall of the appearance attributes of\nsomething and you'll see it kind of pulled\n\n204\n00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.330\nup in the graphics styles which\nis a little something-something.\n\n205\n00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.450\nWe're going to deal with it\nlater in a separate episode, but\n\n206\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.690\nwhat you can see here okay.\n\n207\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.560\nI have that popped Pucker and Bloat so\nit's doing even that, that pucker and\n\n208\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.670\nbloat effect that we apply.\n\n209\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.580\nI even see I have no stroke here\nI can have a fill of orange.\n\n210\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.430\nI can go ahead and\nselect that I can change that.\n\n211\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.000\nWe can add multiple strokes and multiple\nfills which we'll talk about in a second.\n\n212\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.870\nI can also now, edit all of these effects.\n\n213\n00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.750\nSo remember in Illustrator kind of like\nin our control bar, our control panel,\n\n214\n00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.290\nanytime you see something with that\nkind of dotted line underneath it,\n\n215\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.560\nit kind of acts like a link, right?\n\n216\n00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.280\nIt kind of pulls up a dialogue box or\nsomething.\n\n217\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.190\nSo same thing.\n\n218\n00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.550\nIf I say, you know what,\nI don't like that drop shadow.\n\n219\n00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.540\nClick on the word drop shadow and\nit's gonna pull that back up for you.\n\n220\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.240\nSo now I can go ahead and change this.\n\n221\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.700\nOkay maybe I want that color\nto be a little bit more grey.\n\n222\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.620\nI'll kinda keep this to be fairly large\njust so you can see it on my screen.\n\n223\n00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.480\nAgain in a professional scenario\nI'd probably make it smaller,\n\n224\n00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.260\nmore subtle than that but I want you\nguys to still be able to see it at home.\n\n225\n00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.080\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nleave it like that.\n\n226\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.000\nBut you can see how I adjusted that.\n\n227\n00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.410\nAnd it's awesome.\n\n228\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.460\nLikewise, I could have\nadjusted my pucker and bloat.\n\n229\n00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.720\nIf I say, you know what,\nI don't really like that so extreme, or\n\n230\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.570\nmaybe I want to take it\neven farther to the edge.\n\n231\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.550\nI can go ahead and\nhave the option to do that.\n\n232\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.990\nSo, really just a fantastic thing.\n\n233\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.960\nIt's also a great thing, your appearance\npanel, if you open up a file that someone\n\n234\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.070\nelse created, and\nyou don't know what they did to something.\n\n235\n00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.040\nOpen your appearance panel and you can\nselect that object and go ahead and\n\n236\n00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.720\ncheck that out.\n\n237\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I live in the appearance\npanel when I am working on anything.\n\n238\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.030\nAnd especially other people's stuff.\n\n239\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.180\nBecause it's like is that an effect?\n\n240\n00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.630\nIs that like an actual shape?\n\n241\n00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.680\nAnd you can- I am sure you are going\nto get to this point or whatever.\n\n242\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.380\nBut the box,\nlike the actual square still lives there.\n\n243\n00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.120\nThis is not the,\n\n244\n00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.040\nlike a pointed thing that you talked\nabout, moving up points and everything.\n\n245\n00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.920\nIt's still just a regular square.\n\n246\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.210\nA lot of time you can see\nthat from like the selection,\n\n247\n00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.830\nhighlighting if you wanna say.\n\n248\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.240\nBut what's going on there,\nhow do they make those colors or\n\n249\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.812\nthose double strokes or\nanything like that.\n\n250\n00:12:19.812 --> 00:12:23.810\nSo appearances go for all objects,\nanything that's applied.\n\n251\n00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.850\nEven if it's just filling stroke,\nthe text, the shapes.\n\n252\n00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.536\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n253\n00:12:27.536 --> 00:12:31.844\nit's kind of like\nthe information [CROSSTALK].\n\n254\n00:12:31.844 --> 00:12:36.374\nIs the information of every\nappearance of every object on there.\n\n255\n00:12:36.374 --> 00:12:38.600\nSo, I have this open all the time.\n\n256\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.690\n&gt;&gt; It tells you all the appearance\nattributes of every object.\n\n257\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:45.162\nI think it certainly comes up with\neffects, that's always kind of where I\n\n258\n00:12:45.162 --> 00:12:49.190\nwant to introduce it, with the editing and\nall that, but it will show you anything.\n\n259\n00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.640\n&gt;&gt; Yea, I always introduce the appearance\npanel in this lesson as well, so good job.\n\n260\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.640\n&gt;&gt; I'll just go ahead and\ngive myself a pat on the back, good one.\n\n261\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.110\nAll right, so what we're going to look\nat with our appearance panel now.\n\n262\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.710\nYou see the strokes and\nthe fills but you also\n\n263\n00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.790\nmay have noticed that you can add a stroke\nand add a fill there at the bottom.\n\n264\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.340\nSo you can see Add a New Stroke,\nAdd a New Fill.\n\n265\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.000\nI'm gonna adjust this original\nstroke option that we had.\n\n266\n00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.900\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust apply a stroke.\n\n267\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.440\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ngive that a pink stroke, of course,\n\n268\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.571\nbecause that's literally\njust where my mouse goes.\n\n269\n00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:19.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't even think about it,\n\n270\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.730\nit just goes to pink, so.\n\n271\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.900\nMaybe, because I don't think I ever\nget to use that in the real life, but\n\n272\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.260\nI can use it here.\n\n273\n00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.790\nSo I can go ahead and grab that now.\n\n274\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.060\nWhat does it mean to add\nanother stroke on something?\n\n275\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.940\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick on this button, add a new stroke.\n\n276\n00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.470\nSo like,\nokay don't see anything different.\n\n277\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:42.200\nBut if I take this and\nI make that blue and I make that larger,\n\n278\n00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.570\nyou may still be thinking\nyou know what Emily?\n\n279\n00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.080\nI don't see anything different.\n\n280\n00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.740\nIt's because I am looking at\nthis in a specific order.\n\n281\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.640\nSo the order actually\nmakes a difference here.\n\n282\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.740\nSo because the larger stroke is on top.\n\n283\n00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:00.360\nI have the eight point stroke on top\nof the one point Pink stroke below it.\n\n284\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.060\nI can click, hold, and drag and\nmove these things around.\n\n285\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.120\nSo I can click, hold, and drag this down,\n\n286\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.220\nkind of like when we're\nworking with our layers panel.\n\n287\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.870\nIt's almost similar to that,\ndrag this below the pink stroke.\n\n288\n00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.420\nAnd now, what you're gonna see\nis I got that pink stroke.\n\n289\n00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.010\nWith the blue stroke behind it.\n\n290\n00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.670\nSo I can add as many of these as I want.\n\n291\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.500\nLikewise, I can add another fill.\n\n292\n00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.480\nSo I can add a fill color here, you know,\n\n293\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.290\nagain note that order kind of\nwent over my stroke a little bit.\n\n294\n00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.730\nSo maybe I wanna go ahead and\npull that down.\n\n295\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.330\nI can add another fill,\nmaybe make that blue and\n\n296\n00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.760\nyou're like well I got you here\nEmily I really can't see that.\n\n297\n00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.410\nWhat if I take this original orange fill,\nthe one that's on top here and\n\n298\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.130\nchange the opacity.\n\n299\n00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.670\nIf I take that opacity down which\nis gonna pull up our opacity panel.\n\n300\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.840\nIt's gonna bring up some other information\nagain that we'll talk about in\n\n301\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.580\na separate episode like masking.\n\n302\n00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.074\nBut what if I make that 50%?\n\n303\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.650\nIt's gonna give me a 50% opacity or\n\n304\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.700\neven I could do opacity\njust on that specific fill.\n\n305\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.100\nI think when I chose that option I\naccidentally did it on the entire thing.\n\n306\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.100\nBut I can choose the opacity\njust on that specific fill.\n\n307\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.070\nSo if i click on this drop\ndown menu make this fill or\n\n308\n00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:12.320\nactually I wanna rather do the orange one,\nmake this fill 50%.\n\n309\n00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.650\nNow just that particular,\nI don't want to use the word layer,\n\n310\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:21.790\nbut just that particular appearance\nattribute will be set at the 50% opacity.\n\n311\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.060\nSo definitely something that you're\ngonna want to play around with and\n\n312\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.390\nuse you're appearance panel.\n\n313\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.390\nIt's so fantastic for you,\nagain, particularly for\n\n314\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.220\nediting and moving things around.\n\n315\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.080\nNow one thing that I wanted to mention,\nI wanna go back to this image.\n\n316\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.180\nThis doesn't necessarily have as much\nto do with our appearance panel, but\n\n317\n00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.870\nI didn't wanna forget to mention this.\n\n318\n00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.270\nThose stylized effects.\n\n319\n00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.576\nIf I go back to my effects panel and\nthen go to stylize and then drop shadow,\n\n320\n00:15:46.576 --> 00:15:51.368\njust note that this is something that you\ncan also apply to a raster based image, so\n\n321\n00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:54.645\nI could apply a drop shadow or\nwhatever onto that image.\n\n322\n00:15:54.645 --> 00:15:57.816\nNow, it's already got that colored pencil\nso it's like whoa, there's a lot going on\n\n323\n00:15:57.816 --> 00:16:00.132\nhere, but you can see I can go ahead and\napply that drop shadow.\n\n324\n00:16:00.132 --> 00:16:03.050\n&gt;&gt; But I mean I don't think\nyou can do a pucker and bloat.\n\n325\n00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.059\nOn that particular image, right?\n\n326\n00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:09.514\nSo there are some things,\nif you're applying those illustrator\n\n327\n00:16:09.514 --> 00:16:14.060\neffects to a raster piece of information,\nit's not gonna do it.\n\n328\n00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.844\nCuz it's just doesn't translate.\n\n329\n00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:19.045\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nit's limited to just a couple of things.\n\n330\n00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:21.092\nIt's kind of like how when\nwe took our image and\n\n331\n00:16:21.092 --> 00:16:24.571\napplied the Photoshop effects and\nyou solve something and versus the vector.\n\n332\n00:16:24.571 --> 00:16:27.923\nNow we're taking the image and\napplying the Illustrator effects and-\n\n333\n00:16:27.923 --> 00:16:28.795\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n334\n00:16:28.795 --> 00:16:29.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n335\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.825\ngoing back to the puckered star or\nwhat have you.\n\n336\n00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:38.213\nWhen you have the stacking order\nof the different appearances,\n\n337\n00:16:38.213 --> 00:16:43.332\nlike the stroke and everything,\none thing that I always like to point out,\n\n338\n00:16:43.332 --> 00:16:45.700\nis that those effects that we did.\n\n339\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.280\nLike that puffer and bloat, notice how the\npuffer and bloat is on top of everything.\n\n340\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.220\nSo that effect applies to\nevery single thing below it.\n\n341\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.901\nBut if you put that pucker and bloat,\nthat kind of tucked in under one\n\n342\n00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:04.487\nof the strokes, or one of the fills-\n&gt;&gt; Which of course doesn't want to agree\n\n343\n00:17:04.487 --> 00:17:05.581\nwith you right now.\n\n344\n00:17:05.581 --> 00:17:07.653\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it will apply for that, and\n\n345\n00:17:07.653 --> 00:17:11.415\nthen also, if you say, select,\nsorry, I'm directing you now.\n\n346\n00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:12.173\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it.\n\n347\n00:17:12.173 --> 00:17:16.584\n&gt;&gt; If you selected on that orange fill,\nif you went to there and\n\n348\n00:17:16.584 --> 00:17:19.506\nthen went to like the scribble effect.\n\n349\n00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:26.013\nThen it's going to only apply\nto that particular fill and\n\n350\n00:17:26.013 --> 00:17:32.610\nthen, expand out the fill on\nthe orange guy right there.\n\n351\n00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there it is.\n\n352\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.303\n&gt;&gt; It's really slight\nbecause [CROSSTALK] opacity.\n\n353\n00:17:38.303 --> 00:17:38.992\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n354\n00:17:38.992 --> 00:17:43.196\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you can see that\nthat particular one right there,\n\n355\n00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:47.245\nit's only applying the scribble\neffect to that one fill.\n\n356\n00:17:47.245 --> 00:17:49.914\nIt might not be able to\nshow it right now but\n\n357\n00:17:49.914 --> 00:17:52.745\nyou can [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I think I need to adjust my scribbling\n\n358\n00:17:52.745 --> 00:17:53.448\na little bit but\n\n359\n00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:57.310\nthen that's actually a good example of why\nyou may want to use a multiple fill, too.\n\n360\n00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.740\nCuz even if it's not a different opacity.\n\n361\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.270\nI see where you were going.\n\n362\n00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.433\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you picking up what\nI'm putting down, right?\n\n363\n00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:04.680\n&gt;&gt; I do, I do.\n\n364\n00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.063\nShoulder shimmy.\n[LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:18:06.063 --> 00:18:07.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\n\n366\n00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:12.627\nyou can apply those different effects\nto different pieces, just one fill,\n\n367\n00:18:12.627 --> 00:18:17.997\njust one stroke and kind of nest it in\nthere, or as you can see that pucker and\n\n368\n00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:23.046\nbloat goes to every single thing\nthat all the fills, all the strokes.\n\n369\n00:18:23.046 --> 00:18:27.953\nSo just kind of be aware of\nthose effects being applied\n\n370\n00:18:27.953 --> 00:18:32.000\nto those individual parts of your objects.\n\n371\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great point.\n\n372\n00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.370\nI'm glad you brought that up as well.\n\n373\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.420\nAnd one other thing you kind of reminded\nme of, is I can kind of hide one of these.\n\n374\n00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.987\nSo say that I'm not really feeling\nthat pucker and bloat anymore.\n\n375\n00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:44.928\nBut I wanna still keep everything else.\n\n376\n00:18:44.928 --> 00:18:46.584\nIt's not actually necessarily\ngonna get rid of it,\n\n377\n00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:47.645\nbut I can toggle the visibility.\n\n378\n00:18:47.645 --> 00:18:51.400\nSo I can click on the eyeball,\nand that goes to Vonne's point.\n\n379\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.611\nThat original square is still there, and\nI can kinda just see okay, you know what,\n\n380\n00:18:55.611 --> 00:18:59.461\nI'm not filling that stroke, and\nI can kinda go through, [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n381\n00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:01.656\ntoggle the visibility on and\noff as I work.\n\n382\n00:19:01.656 --> 00:19:06.427\n&gt;&gt; And one more a little point that I have\nwith the strokes, because you can see\n\n383\n00:19:06.427 --> 00:19:11.610\nlike the pink is kind of hard to see in\nthe middle, you can then do your stroke.\n\n384\n00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.359\nCan't you click right on that\nstroke right from there?\n\n385\n00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:13.870\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep.\n\n386\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:17.558\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\nAnd you can change the alignments to do\n\n387\n00:19:17.558 --> 00:19:20.550\nlike inside or outside.\n\n388\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.157\nLike with the blue.\n\n389\n00:19:21.157 --> 00:19:24.057\nIf you did the blue to the outside,\n\n390\n00:19:24.057 --> 00:19:28.560\nthen you can really see\nthe other stroke that, yeah.\n\n391\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.302\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; So now we can see that the blue\n\n392\n00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:32.180\nis outside, the pink is inside.\n\n393\n00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.849\nAnd that's something when I\nstart using multiple strokes,\n\n394\n00:19:36.849 --> 00:19:43.270\nthat the alignment of the stroke makes a\nbig difference in these types of examples.\n\n395\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:48.267\nCuz I can put two, three, four, five, and\nit kinda goes back to my rainbows, right?\n\n396\n00:19:48.267 --> 00:19:48.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n397\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.754\n&gt;&gt; So you make a rainbow effect, but\n\n398\n00:19:50.754 --> 00:19:54.891\nif you don't have the alignments of\nthe stroke, it can be kind of weird.\n\n399\n00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:55.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n400\n00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.174\n&gt;&gt; So another little tip from me.\n\n401\n00:19:57.174 --> 00:19:58.335\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm glad you're here.\n\n402\n00:19:58.335 --> 00:20:00.470\n[LAUGH] I like the tips, I'm feeling it.\n\n403\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.690\nSo yeah, there's just so\nmuch you can do with the appearance panel.\n\n404\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.874\nAgain, it's really not\nnecessarily tied just to effects.\n\n405\n00:20:05.874 --> 00:20:09.384\nAs you can see, there's so much more you\ncan do with just strokes and fills but\n\n406\n00:20:09.384 --> 00:20:12.310\nit just kinda naturally comes up\nin this discussion of effects.\n\n407\n00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.966\nSo with that, I wanna go ahead and\n\n408\n00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:16.640\nshow you one more thing before\nwe run out of time here.\n\n409\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.050\nLooking at our 3D effects, so\nI want to say [LAUGH] I am sorry.\n\n410\n00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.391\nI have to take the picture\nof the cat away.\n\n411\n00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:25.520\nI have got to get rid of him.\n\n412\n00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.119\nGo ahead and grab a shape.\n\n413\n00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:31.660\nAnd we can do some 3D action here.\n\n414\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.288\nSo I am going to go ahead and\ngive this, just a shape.\n\n415\n00:20:34.288 --> 00:20:35.177\nNo fill.\n\n416\n00:20:35.177 --> 00:20:39.816\nJust to fill, no strokes, excuse me.\n\n417\n00:20:39.816 --> 00:20:41.750\n[LAUGH] I'm always in\nthe ability to talk here.\n\n418\n00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.044\nYou could keep a stroke on it, I just,\nfor whatever reason, don't want one.\n\n419\n00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:49.070\nAnd then, I'm gonna go back to my\nEffects menu and I'm gonna choose 3D.\n\n420\n00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.020\nSo it's gonna be that first one\nunder our Illustrator Effects.\n\n421\n00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.788\nAnd I'm gonna start with\nan extrude in bevel.\n\n422\n00:20:54.788 --> 00:21:01.180\nThis is gonna be something that I feel\nlike maybe, reminds me more of Photoshop.\n\n423\n00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.487\nI don't think it's necessarily something\nthat you would specifically see\n\n424\n00:21:03.487 --> 00:21:04.181\nalways in Photoshop.\n\n425\n00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:06.130\nBut it just kind of gives\nme that effect to it.\n\n426\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.480\nIt's gonna be much more of\na photo realistic style thing.\n\n427\n00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.110\nSo that's kind of why I look at it.\n\n428\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.570\nAnd there's a lot that you can do with it.\n\n429\n00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.962\nYou can change the position\nhere in your drop down menu,\n\n430\n00:21:15.962 --> 00:21:21.130\nyou kinda just change the position on your\nown or even typing in some things here.\n\n431\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.100\nYou can adjust the extrude depth.\n\n432\n00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.280\nSo if I want that to kind of\ngo out a little bit farther,\n\n433\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.128\nI may go back to the set,\nnot that front, but the off axis front.\n\n434\n00:21:30.128 --> 00:21:31.742\nI'm just gonna stick with that one there.\n\n435\n00:21:31.742 --> 00:21:35.935\nWith the extrude depth, I can go ahead and\nsay, okay, I want that to be a lot fatter,\n\n436\n00:21:35.935 --> 00:21:38.020\nbasically, as what you're looking at.\n\n437\n00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.883\nYou can adjust the cap as well,\n\n438\n00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:44.200\nthat's gonna kinda make it hollow\nis an option that you have.\n\n439\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.120\nSo there's all kinds of just again,\njust playing around with it.\n\n440\n00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.302\nIt's not even necessarily me\nsitting here and telling you,\n\n441\n00:21:50.302 --> 00:21:51.600\nokay this is exactly what you need.\n\n442\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.580\nBut just looking and saying, okay, these\nare the options that I get with my bevel.\n\n443\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.490\nLook how you can change that.\n\n444\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.690\nThat is something that you can impact.\n\n445\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.207\nLike woah, that jaggedy,\nit looks like an accordion, right?\n\n446\n00:22:02.207 --> 00:22:03.950\nYou can do that.\n\n447\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.130\nSo you can also adjust the surface,\nthings like that.\n\n448\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:10.423\nNow one thing I want to point out here\nthat you may not necessarily have\n\n449\n00:22:10.423 --> 00:22:12.570\nnoticed is that Map Art option.\n\n450\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.546\nSo if I click on Map Art, what that's\ngonna do, okay, you're gonna see, okay,\n\n451\n00:22:16.546 --> 00:22:17.597\nno difference here.\n\n452\n00:22:17.597 --> 00:22:20.849\nSee where it says symbol at the top?\n\n453\n00:22:20.849 --> 00:22:22.565\nRight now, it's set at none.\n\n454\n00:22:22.565 --> 00:22:28.453\nNow, symbols are gonna be something we\ndiscuss in a totally different episode but\n\n455\n00:22:28.453 --> 00:22:32.462\nbasically this is gonna be\nsome artwork that we can apply\n\n456\n00:22:32.462 --> 00:22:35.210\nspecifically on to this object here.\n\n457\n00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.901\nSo I can just pick one from the drop-down\nmenu, it has to be a symbol,\n\n458\n00:22:38.901 --> 00:22:42.540\nwill talk about how to create\nsymbols in the different episode.\n\n459\n00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.662\nBut this are kinda the defaults here,\nand what you can do is you can say, okay\n\n460\n00:22:47.662 --> 00:22:53.289\nI want that to go ahead and apply to this\nspecific surface, in this specific place.\n\n461\n00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:54.670\nAnd you can see what it does.\n\n462\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:55.508\nIt kind of gives it that perspective.\n\n463\n00:22:55.508 --> 00:23:00.158\nIf I try to take this symbol or try to\ntake some art without being in this and\n\n464\n00:23:00.158 --> 00:23:05.111\ntry to place it on there, it wouldn't\ngive it that kind of sidewayness to it,\n\n465\n00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:06.510\nthat perspective.\n\n466\n00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.081\nIt would try and just be flat and\n\n467\n00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:11.111\nit wouldn't appear as if it\nwas actually on our 3D effect.\n\n468\n00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:13.720\nNow, you can also change the surface.\n\n469\n00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.610\nSo you don't have to just use this one\nin particular front facing surface.\n\n470\n00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.550\nYou see how that red\noutline is there around it?\n\n471\n00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.385\nThat's letting us know which\nsurface we have chosen.\n\n472\n00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:23.900\nBut I can filter it through.\n\n473\n00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.275\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthere's this 42 of them right now.\n\n474\n00:23:25.275 --> 00:23:26.081\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n475\n00:23:26.081 --> 00:23:28.100\n&gt;&gt; Like why is there 42?\n\n476\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.343\nWell that's because of the-\n&gt;&gt; The jagged.\n\n477\n00:23:30.343 --> 00:23:34.568\n&gt;&gt; The jaggedness that you had and\nso if we click either OK, or Cancel,\n\n478\n00:23:34.568 --> 00:23:35.690\nchange that-\n&gt;&gt; We'll do another one.\n\n479\n00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.037\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go back.\n\n480\n00:23:37.037 --> 00:23:41.375\nThat makes it a little easier cuz now\nthere's only six, cuz if you think about\n\n481\n00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:43.111\nan actual cube or like a dice-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n\n482\n00:23:43.111 --> 00:23:45.056\n&gt;&gt; There's six sides of a dice.\n\n483\n00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:49.677\nAnd so if I wanted to map artwork\non different sides of that dice or\n\n484\n00:23:49.677 --> 00:23:54.469\ncube, you just have to kind of cycle\nthrough and watching those red\n\n485\n00:23:54.469 --> 00:23:59.433\nlines that are kind of highlighting\nwhich side of this particular 3D\n\n486\n00:23:59.433 --> 00:24:04.506\ncube that we have That's gonna make\na difference of cycling through.\n\n487\n00:24:04.506 --> 00:24:05.517\n&gt;&gt; Uh-hum/\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n488\n00:24:05.517 --> 00:24:09.862\nAnd if you want to go ahead and map all\n42 sides of that jagged bevel thing.\n\n489\n00:24:09.862 --> 00:24:10.589\n&gt;&gt; You got it.\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n490\n00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:13.725\nBut showing it on\na regular cube-like face,\n\n491\n00:24:13.725 --> 00:24:18.980\nI think makes it a little bit easier and\nlike I said it is a symbol.\n\n492\n00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.950\nBut it's, I love this.\n\n493\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.170\nI always love to show the 3D in bevel and\nthe map artwork.\n\n494\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.266\nThis is one of those, like ooh, how many\ntimes have you used this in real life?\n\n495\n00:24:28.266 --> 00:24:29.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Besides just having fun?\n\n496\n00:24:29.528 --> 00:24:33.170\nYeah, it depends.\n\n497\n00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.980\nBut I mean if you think, okay, think about\nif you were having to do a product design\n\n498\n00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.120\nof this is what the box of cereal is\ngonna look like with your logo on it.\n\n499\n00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.271\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just to give that appearance of that\n\n500\n00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:45.961\ntype of marketing collateral.\n\n501\n00:24:45.961 --> 00:24:46.486\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n502\n00:24:46.486 --> 00:24:47.747\n&gt;&gt; I just came up with\nthat in my head right now.\n\n503\n00:24:47.747 --> 00:24:49.162\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a genius example.\n\n504\n00:24:49.162 --> 00:24:51.573\nYeah, I was thinking like a bar graph,\nlike sometimes,\n\n505\n00:24:51.573 --> 00:24:54.800\nwhich you have a graph tool and\nit'll show your, but you know, whatever.\n\n506\n00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.302\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n507\n00:24:55.302 --> 00:24:57.395\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I just thought of that and\nI'm like, yeah,\n\n508\n00:24:57.395 --> 00:24:59.190\ncuz if you're doing a style guide or like.\n\n509\n00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.729\n&gt;&gt; Uh-hum.\n&gt;&gt; This\n\n510\n00:24:59.729 --> 00:25:02.868\nis what your logo will look in\nall these different things.\n\n511\n00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:06.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This could be one that could be kind of\n\n512\n00:25:06.476 --> 00:25:07.540\ncool to do.\n\n513\n00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm so impressed.\n\n514\n00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.095\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you.\n\n515\n00:25:09.095 --> 00:25:10.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll pat myself on the back on\n\n516\n00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.261\nthat one [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n517\n00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:12.987\n&gt;&gt; I think that's a great example.\n\n518\n00:25:12.987 --> 00:25:16.005\nAnd again I kinda hate to keep saying\nthis, but just kinda play around a bit,\n\n519\n00:25:16.005 --> 00:25:16.720\nsee what you get.\n\n520\n00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.680\nSee what different kind of styles\nare really working for you.\n\n521\n00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nright here in this particular scheme,\n\n522\n00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:28.250\nonce you're done mapping the artwork,\nthen you can go back and change the key.\n\n523\n00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.250\nI was like, she'll catch it.\n\n524\n00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I didn't even\nnecessarily mean to.\n\n525\n00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.155\nBut yes.\n\n526\n00:25:34.155 --> 00:25:36.868\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you can move the cube around and\n\n527\n00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:40.589\nlike change the face of like which one\nyou want to do in that kind of like\n\n528\n00:25:40.589 --> 00:25:41.900\nrotatory thing.\n\n529\n00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.140\nThat's right in there, yeah that guide.\n\n530\n00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.460\n&gt;&gt; So the rotator?\n\n531\n00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.781\n&gt;&gt; The rotator guide, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n532\n00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:50.970\nAnd if you have specific measurements,\nyou can go ahead and type in.\n\n533\n00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.919\nI was just to kind of drag it around.\n\n534\n00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:55.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well because you can, right?\n\n535\n00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.480\nIt's just fun.\n\n536\n00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.635\n&gt;&gt; It is [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you definitely,\n\n537\n00:25:58.635 --> 00:26:02.220\nyou have all kinds of different\noptions that you can do.\n\n538\n00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.480\nAnd again, without to sound\nlike I'm beating a dead horse.\n\n539\n00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.400\nJust kinda keep playing around\nuntil you see what you got.\n\n540\n00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.230\nBut I think that should be a great way\nto kinda get introduced to effects and\n\n541\n00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.130\nget excited about it.\n\n542\n00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n543\n00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.690\nAnd like you said, we're not gonna\ngo through every single one of them.\n\n544\n00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.578\nAnd in those Photoshop effects,\nyou bring up that screen,\n\n545\n00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:22.890\nthere's all those little like slider\nyou got all over to the right.\n\n546\n00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.646\n&gt;&gt; Where you can kinda control how much\ncolored pencil and how much glowing edges,\n\n547\n00:26:26.646 --> 00:26:27.945\nit's my favorite to show.\n\n548\n00:26:27.945 --> 00:26:28.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n549\n00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.617\n&gt;&gt; And then you can go ahead and\nmess with that but\n\n550\n00:26:31.617 --> 00:26:35.250\njust to make sure you remember\nthe appearance panel,\n\n551\n00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:40.590\nthe importance of it, and being able\nto go back there to edit the effects.\n\n552\n00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:44.220\nChange that stacking order,\nadd effects to different parts of it.\n\n553\n00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.350\nThe more you use Illustrator,\n\n554\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.440\nthe more you're gonna probably stay\nin that appearance panel a lot.\n\n555\n00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.220\nJust kinda have it over to the side,\njust seeing what's going on.\n\n556\n00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.031\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, lot's of fun stuff.\n\n557\n00:26:55.031 --> 00:26:58.673\nLots of new tools for you guys to\ngo ahead and play around with and\n\n558\n00:26:58.673 --> 00:27:01.170\nspend hours [LAUGH] just tinkering around.\n\n559\n00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.866\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up, we're gonna sign off for\n\n560\n00:27:04.866 --> 00:27:07.230\nCreative Pro TV I've been your host,\nVonne Smith\n\n561\n00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.000\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily

edition of CREATIVE Pro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.556\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\nthis is Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n5\n00:00:19.556 --> 00:00:23.041\nAnd we are going to be working with\ngraphics styles in this episode.\n\n6\n00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.800\nI love graphic styles.\n\n7\n00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.676\nThere's actually not much in\nIllustrator that I don't love.\n\n8\n00:00:28.676 --> 00:00:29.776\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:30.780\n&gt;&gt; And I love\n\n10\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.460\nthat Emily Ramsey is back yet\nagain to help us.\n\n11\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.004\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n12\n00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:34.815\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n13\n00:00:34.815 --> 00:00:36.316\n&gt;&gt; I know, Vonne's so excited,\nshe can't contain herself.\n\n14\n00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:39.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All about the graphic styles, and\n\n15\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.343\nreally I can understand why.\n\n16\n00:00:40.343 --> 00:00:45.590\nI mean they are just not only cool but\nalso just kind of useful,\n\n17\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.640\nso that kind of a nice thing to\nabout is if you do it right,\n\n18\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.490\nwhich we were kindly joking before,\nI often don't.\n\n19\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.050\nNot on purpose but, just you know,\n\n20\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.015\nI kind of forget that I have it\navailable to me when I'm working.\n\n21\n00:00:56.015 --> 00:01:02.140\nBut it really can, again, make your life\nmuch easier if you are doing it properly.\n\n22\n00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.820\nAside from just the fun aspect of it.\n\n23\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.250\nSo what we're gonna do, I'm gonna go ahead\nand hop into my Illustrator art board, and\n\n24\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.720\nyou'll see I just have\na blank black square.\n\n25\n00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.970\nSo kinda drab, right.\n\n26\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.360\nAnd then I also have my\ngraphic styles panel open.\n\n27\n00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.460\nSo of course if you don't have\nyour graphic styles panel open,\n\n28\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.060\ngo to Window, go to Graphic Styles,\nand go ahead and grab that down.\n\n29\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.240\nSo what are graphic styles do?\n\n30\n00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.480\nThey are a set of reusable\nappearance attributes.\n\n31\n00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.470\nSo you can basically take any shape and\nthen copy the appearance of something,\n\n32\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.050\nkind of like going back\nto our appearance panel.\n\n33\n00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.720\nWe're going to hop back in there.\n\n34\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.120\nYou can copy those appearance\nattributes over onto another shape.\n\n35\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.690\nSo if you say, you get something you\nreally like or, we're gonna start with\n\n36\n00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.320\nkinda the preexisting ones,\nthe library of graphic styles.\n\n37\n00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.211\nSay if I like that effect\nI can go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:51.336\njust apply it to multiple\ndifferent shapes.\n\n39\n00:01:51.336 --> 00:01:52.774\nSo really kind of nice for that.\n\n40\n00:01:52.774 --> 00:01:55.150\nSo I'm gonna go and\npull up my graphic styles.\n\n41\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.570\nI'm gonna start with the,\nI won't say the boring ones, but\n\n42\n00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.120\nI'm gonna start with all\nthe white ones here.\n\n43\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.080\nWhat we have here,\nwe have that first option.\n\n44\n00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080\nThat's just gonna be our\ndefault style in Illustrator.\n\n45\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.530\nIf for some reason you wanna go\nback to that, that white fill and\n\n46\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.950\nthat black stroke with the one point,\nthat's gonna be our default style.\n\n47\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.790\nNow I'm gonna Cmd or Ctrl+Z just so\nwe can get to that black square.\n\n48\n00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.400\nNow these ones with the Alt,\nI gave away my trick,\n\n49\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.260\nwith the red slash through it in the\nbottom left hand corner of the preview.\n\n50\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.040\nThat's letting you know that that's\nsomething that only, it does not apply\n\n51\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.330\na fill or a stroke to something, it only\ndoes something kind of outside of it.\n\n52\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.290\nSo what I need to do, basically,\nthis one's an example of a drop shadow,\n\n53\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.300\nI need to Alt or Option click on it.\n\n54\n00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.148\nAnd then you can see from there it's gonna\ngo ahead and apply just a drop shadow.\n\n55\n00:02:44.148 --> 00:02:46.745\nAnd even maybe I'll go back here and\nI'll change that to blue or\n\n56\n00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:49.350\nsomething like that so\nyou can maybe see it a little bit better.\n\n57\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.105\nIt's pretty subtle.\n\n58\n00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:51.797\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, cuz I'm like,\n\n59\n00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:52.674\nwhat did it do?\n\n60\n00:02:52.674 --> 00:02:56.569\nIt's a very, very small drop\nshadow that's being applied there.\n\n61\n00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.565\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but what we can do,\nwe can go to our appearance panel.\n\n62\n00:02:59.565 --> 00:03:02.629\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go Window Appearance and\n\n63\n00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.867\nyou can see, okay yes,\nI do indeed have a drop shadow there.\n\n64\n00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:11.071\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that, just to clarify, the\nAlt that you did, that was where if you\n\n65\n00:03:11.071 --> 00:03:14.649\nhad not held your Alt key down it\nwould take out the fill in stroke.\n\n66\n00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.060\nIs that correct?\n\n67\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.280\n&gt;&gt; I believe just yeah,\nnothing happens, or\n\n68\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.870\nbasically it just removes all\nthe formatting that you have there, yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and the Alt was like, okay, I\nonly want you to apply just whatever's in\n\n70\n00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.350\nthe effect, which would be the drop\nshadow, and keep my fill and or stroke or\n\n71\n00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.750\nwhatever else I have on it.\n\n72\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.612\n&gt;&gt; Right, thank you for\nthe clarification, yes.\n\n73\n00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:38.457\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not sure if I knew that,\nso that's why I was like, okay.\n\n74\n00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:41.395\nThere was just another light\nbulb that came off of like,\n\n75\n00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:43.092\nI don't think I've done that.\n\n76\n00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:44.188\nSo thank you [LAUGH].\n\n77\n00:03:44.188 --> 00:03:45.706\n&gt;&gt; Pat on the back again.\n\n78\n00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:47.200\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n79\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.240\nAll right, so what we can do here,\nyou can kinda go through them.\n\n80\n00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.630\nYou can see this one,\nit kinda looks like that first one we did.\n\n81\n00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.460\nBut what's actually happening is it's\nrounding the corners a little bit.\n\n82\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.750\nSo you can see just, again,\na very subtle corner round on that one.\n\n83\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.110\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and go back.\n\n84\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.700\nWe'll just kinda keep filtering through.\n\n85\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.390\nMaybe I'll Command+Z or\nwhatever a couple of times.\n\n86\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.460\nAnd then we'll end with this,\none of the less exciting options.\n\n87\n00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.920\nAnd then we'll go ahead and Alt click\nagain, cuz I see that red slash and\n\n88\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.470\nbasically what this is gonna do\nis it's gonna mirror for us.\n\n89\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.950\nSo that's an option that you have.\n\n90\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.678\nNow you could use that.\n\n91\n00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.727\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That didn't duplicate.\n\n92\n00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:27.180\nThat was the effect in the appearance-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n93\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.280\n&gt;&gt; Panel of making it look like you\nhave another object, all right.\n\n94\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.483\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think I've\n\n95\n00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:36.043\nreally messed with that one before.\n\n96\n00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:39.005\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not one I've ever used in real\n\n97\n00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:40.666\nlife aside from just teaching.\n\n98\n00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:42.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's great cuz when you're going\n\n99\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.970\nthrough all these, I kind of just glossed\nover these throughout all of the years.\n\n100\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.960\nI was like, whatever.\n\n101\n00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.520\nI do use the first one decently enough\nto where it's like I just kinda\n\n102\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.531\nwant to get back to zero,\nget back to base if you want to say.\n\n103\n00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:58.757\nCuz I've gone through\nall of these different,\n\n104\n00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:03.447\napplying different strokes and\nfills and it's like, just go back.\n\n105\n00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:07.415\nSo that's the only one I've used, and so\nI've already learned quite a few things.\n\n106\n00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:09.205\n&gt;&gt; I do like the drop shadow personally,\n\n107\n00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:13.025\ncuz it's just a little bit different than\nthe settings you get if you go to effect\n\n108\n00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:16.915\ndrop shadow, or effect stylized drop\nshadow rather, and try to apply it there.\n\n109\n00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.640\nSo I kinda like it.\n\n110\n00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.146\nDo I use it often professionally?\n\n111\n00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:22.750\nNo, but\n[LAUGH] you can see that it's there.\n\n112\n00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.950\nSo we'll get into kinda some\nmore jazzier ones here.\n\n113\n00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.010\nAnd something that I wanna\npoint out as we're doing this,\n\n114\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.160\nif you think that these little icons,\nthumbnails, whatever you wanna call them,\n\n115\n00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.070\nthey're a little too small,\nas I sometimes have that problem.\n\n116\n00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.030\nMaybe it's my eyesight going on me.\n\n117\n00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.330\nWhat I can do, I can right-click and\nyou're gonna get a larger preview on that.\n\n118\n00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.080\nSo just a fun little tidbit there,\nif you're having trouble seeing it,\n\n119\n00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.170\ngo ahead and right-click and\nyou can see that.\n\n120\n00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.500\nNow, to use one of these all I\nhave to do is just single click.\n\n121\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.940\nAnd you can see how that's taking\nthose appearance attributes and\n\n122\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.330\napplying it to my shape.\n\n123\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.820\nAnd you can even see, like I have\nmy appearance panel open over here,\n\n124\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.690\nwe'll kinda move everything over.\n\n125\n00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.130\nMy appearance panel is\nchanging as I do this.\n\n126\n00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.770\nSo I have all of those options there\n\n127\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.290\navailable to me to then later go and\nchange.\n\n128\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.320\nSo what if I like this but\nI want to change something.\n\n129\n00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.090\nI can do that in my appearance panel,\nand we'll show that in a second.\n\n130\n00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.440\nBut I also wanna point\nout our libraries here.\n\n131\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.210\nSo of course you're not limited to\njust four cool options with your\n\n132\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.280\ngraphic styles.\n\n133\n00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.860\nYou can go ahead and click on that\nlibraries button, similar to your swatch\n\n134\n00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.150\nlibraries or some of the other things\nthat we've talked about, brush libraries.\n\n135\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:37.000\nYou can go ahead and click on that and\ncan see, okay, maybe I want neon effects.\n\n136\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.380\nI can go ahead and select that and\n\n137\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.640\nit's gonna give me kind of\nlike a neon illuminating sign.\n\n138\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.860\nI can go back here, I can choose maybe,\nand I need to select that shape again so\n\n139\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.050\nI can actually see it.\n\n140\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.689\nI go to my scribble effects.\n\n141\n00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.350\nLike hey, that's kind of fun.\n\n142\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.570\nMaybe I like that.\n\n143\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.100\nOr I wanna do something like this one,\nuntil you get, of course, this\n\n144\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.750\nis one of those things you just kind of\nkeep playing around with it until you see.\n\n145\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.710\nI don't need to go through and show you\nwhat each of them looks like individually.\n\n146\n00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.810\nBut I can give you a kind of a basic\nunderstanding of how this works.\n\n147\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.250\nNow, once I kind of get one that I like,\n\n148\n00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.500\nnow I mentioned kind of\nbeing able to edit these.\n\n149\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.460\nSo now that we know about\nthe appearance panel,\n\n150\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.330\nthink about how we can use that\nto kinda make these our own.\n\n151\n00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.020\nSo I like this effect, but\nI don't like the colors or something.\n\n152\n00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.280\nSo I can go here and\nI can see everything that they did.\n\n153\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.810\nOkay, they did a fill here, they applied\na scribble to that, opacity set at 70%.\n\n154\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.960\nFill here, scribble,\nopacity at 60, yada, yada, yada.\n\n155\n00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.320\nAnd I can say you know what?\n\n156\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.660\nMaybe I want to change the color.\n\n157\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.370\nMaybe I want to make that my default,\npink, just whatever, orange.\n\n158\n00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.500\nI can go ahead and click on that.\n\n159\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.442\nI can make this one-\n&gt;&gt; Pink.\n\n160\n00:07:42.442 --> 00:07:43.530\n&gt;&gt; Darker orange.\n\n161\n00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.059\nI know I was like not pink,\nnot pink, not pink.\n\n162\n00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:48.280\n[LAUGH] Pick something else, yellow.\n\n163\n00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.920\nAnything that you want to do you\ncan kind of apply that there.\n\n164\n00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.990\nLikewise I could adjust\nthe scribble effect.\n\n165\n00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.920\nMaybe I don't want it to be quite so\nscribbly or\n\n166\n00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.550\nI want to do something like that.\n\n167\n00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.920\nAll of those options that we have\navailable to us in our appearance panel of\n\n168\n00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.490\nbeing able to change that,\nyou can do to your graphics style.\n\n169\n00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.550\nSo that's kinda one of\nthe handy things about it.\n\n170\n00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.940\nNow what you can also do with this is\nyou can go ahead and create your own.\n\n171\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.090\nSo if I go ahead and decide, you know\nwhat, I like this, I wanna keep this.\n\n172\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.890\nAll you have to do, drag and\ndrop this into my graphic styles panel.\n\n173\n00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.930\nSo drag and drop this shape.\n\n174\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.100\nYou can see as I do that I get my cursor,\n\n175\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.220\nbut then I have a big green\ncircle with a plus sign on it.\n\n176\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.010\nThat's just letting me know\nI'm gonna drag and drop that.\n\n177\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:29.820\nSo I can go ahead and\n\n178\n00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.680\nsay, okay, I'm now adding that as\none of my graphics styles options.\n\n179\n00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.200\nSo if I say I wanna keep using that,\nI can do it.\n\n180\n00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.440\nSo now I can go grab another shape and\nI can go ahead and apply that.\n\n181\n00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.690\nAnd it's not limited to just my squares,\nI can go ahead and\n\n182\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.430\napply that to a circle or really anything.\n\n183\n00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:54.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not attached to the object\nor path that you made the style from.\n\n184\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.682\nSo you made it on a rectangle, you think\nit's always gonna make it a rectangle.\n\n185\n00:08:56.682 --> 00:09:01.251\nNo, you can do it on text, circles,\nanything, any really path.\n\n186\n00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:04.104\nNow of course if you just have a line,\nit's not really gonna do something on this\n\n187\n00:09:04.104 --> 00:09:05.344\nparticular-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.679\n&gt;&gt; Cuz all this stuff is in a fill.\n\n189\n00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.362\nSo that might trip you up a little bit.\n\n190\n00:09:08.362 --> 00:09:09.920\nI was like, it didn't work.\n\n191\n00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.930\nWell look at what is in\nthe appearance panel.\n\n192\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.900\nNothing is really on the stroke.\n\n193\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.802\nSo that kinda makes a big difference\nthere, but and you can apply it anywhere.\n\n194\n00:09:18.802 --> 00:09:23.714\nAnd talking about making your own,\nthis is where I use.\n\n195\n00:09:23.714 --> 00:09:27.537\nMaybe even just something as\nsimple as a drop shadow and\n\n196\n00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:31.859\na specific stroke that I'm going\nto be using on a whole bunch of\n\n197\n00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:35.451\nthings like squares and\ntext and things like that.\n\n198\n00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:37.211\nGo ahead and make it a graphic style and\n\n199\n00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:40.291\nthen each time I'm adding more\nelements just boop, boop, boop,\n\n200\n00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:44.100\napply the same effect or style, I guess we\ncould say, and then move on from there.\n\n201\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.990\nSo that's how I like to use it.\n\n202\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.730\nAnd you've already shown me quite a few\nthings, the right-clicking, to do.\n\n203\n00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.295\n&gt;&gt; It's a life changer.\n\n204\n00:09:52.295 --> 00:09:53.435\n&gt;&gt; I've never seen that before.\n\n205\n00:09:53.435 --> 00:09:54.441\nI bet people are like, really, nice.\n\n206\n00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:59.098\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's hard to impress this woman in\n\n207\n00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.475\nIllustrator, so I'm glad I got it, yeah.\n\n208\n00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:03.871\nNo, but I think you actually brought us to\na great point, I think now may be a good\n\n209\n00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.950\ntime to go ahead and show you how to\nkind of create your own from scratch.\n\n210\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.610\nNow we basically already know how to do\nthis cuz it's really gonna be any of those\n\n211\n00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.850\neffects or applying a stroke or a color or\nreally anything that you wanna do.\n\n212\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.424\nAnything that you wanna repeat,\nyou just grab those appearance attributes\n\n213\n00:10:18.424 --> 00:10:22.430\nthat you like, I maybe will just\nkind of go into my swatches panel.\n\n214\n00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.310\nGotta do pink, I'm sorry it's\njust happening, it's happening.\n\n215\n00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:32.781\nAnd I can go here, I can go to Effect,\nI can go maybe just sort and transform.\n\n216\n00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:34.563\nI wanna do a pucker and bloat,\ncuz yeah, those are fun.\n\n217\n00:10:34.563 --> 00:10:36.590\nGo ahead and\ngrab something like that, hit OK.\n\n218\n00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.507\nI could do, maybe add a stroke to this.\n\n219\n00:10:42.804 --> 00:10:43.823\nRunning out of color options.\n\n220\n00:10:43.823 --> 00:10:45.910\nI'll do that, sure.\n\n221\n00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.220\nGo ahead and apply that there.\n\n222\n00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.392\nYou're seeing like whoa,\nmy stroke on the pucker and\n\n223\n00:10:49.392 --> 00:10:51.030\nbloat is looking a little funny.\n\n224\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.080\nI may be able to go ahead and\nadjust that in my appearance panel.\n\n225\n00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.320\nIf I go ahead ahead and adjust that there\nso that way that falls under my pucker.\n\n226\n00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.100\nYou see my pucker and\nbloat just fell under my fill.\n\n227\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.800\n&gt;&gt; And it's probably because you-\n&gt;&gt; Applied it.\n\n228\n00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.400\n&gt;&gt; Like selected in the appearance\npanel and then applied it.\n\n229\n00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.024\nBut then if you want it for\nall of it, just pull that pucker and\n\n230\n00:11:09.024 --> 00:11:11.400\nbloat it all the way to the top,\nlike above the stroke.\n\n231\n00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:17.088\nAnd you can see now the stroke\nis on the whole element,\n\n232\n00:11:17.088 --> 00:11:20.762\nwell the stroke is already there.\n\n233\n00:11:20.762 --> 00:11:21.510\nThe pucker and bloat is being\napplied to the whole element.\n\n234\n00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.070\nSo that stacking order in\nthe appearance panel is always good.\n\n235\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.410\nI do this all the time,\nI forget that I'm on something and\n\n236\n00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.480\nthen choosing an applied thing,\nchange it around.\n\n237\n00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.250\n&gt;&gt; But that's the beauty of the appearance\npanel, just being able to be like, ehh,\n\n238\n00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.410\nactually I just wanna do that.\n\n239\n00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.880\nI don't need to Control+Z or anything.\n\n240\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.200\nMy default is always like,\ngo back, go back, go back.\n\n241\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.650\nI just instinctively do it.\n\n242\n00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.860\nBut you just change it in your\nappearance panel, it's super easy.\n\n243\n00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.940\nLet's say, okay, I want to go ahead and\nmake that a style.\n\n244\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.760\nAnd, I'm just going to call that that and\ngo ahead and create my own.\n\n245\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.580\nI can click, hold, and drag.\n\n246\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.660\nCreate my own.\n\n247\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.330\nAnd then now, as we see, I'll actually go\nahead, I have a separate example of this.\n\n248\n00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.070\nIf we wanna just pull this up.\n\n249\n00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.370\nHow I can apply this to\na couple of different shapes,\n\n250\n00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.510\nor what it's going to look like.\n\n251\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.060\nI can even just grab all of these,\ngo ahead and apply that.\n\n252\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.930\nAnd you can see,\n\n253\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.050\nwow, that looks kind of crazy with\nthe pucker and bloat on my text.\n\n254\n00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:14.510\nIt reminds me of, I don't know,\nlike I'm Polynesian or something.\n\n255\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.065\n&gt;&gt; I was going AC/DC, so we went kind\nof two totally different directions.\n\n256\n00:12:18.065 --> 00:12:20.342\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking yeah.\n\n257\n00:12:20.342 --> 00:12:22.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking about Disney and\n\n258\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.690\nmy head kept going to the Polynesian.\n\n259\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.920\nI don't know.\n\n260\n00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.360\nI'm just going there.\n\n261\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.770\nSo you can see how you can apply this and\nhow it will look.\n\n262\n00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.880\nIt actually looks kind of\ncool in the circle and\n\n263\n00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.430\nalmost more similar to the square,\nsomething interesting.\n\n264\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.680\nSo something else that\nI wanted to mention.\n\n265\n00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.610\nIf I were to go here and edit this or\neven just create my own, whatever.\n\n266\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.780\nEither option would matter.\n\n267\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:49.920\nAnd I say, maybe I just want to\nchange something subtle about this.\n\n268\n00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.230\nI'm gonna go here in the appearance\npanel and change that one to orange.\n\n269\n00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.300\nNow what if I wanted it to effect\nall of the ones that already have\n\n270\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.480\nthis appearance attribute on it?\n\n271\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.510\nI could go ahead and just create\na new one and then apply that there.\n\n272\n00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.700\nThat certainly would be an option.\n\n273\n00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.660\nBut I can also replace\na current graphic style.\n\n274\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.790\nSo what I can do, I can click,\nhold, and drag this over to my art,\n\n275\n00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.100\nor, my art board panel,\nmy graphic styles panel.\n\n276\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.420\nHold down my Alt or\nOption key, and as I do that,\n\n277\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.567\nrather than kind of hovering between them.\n\n278\n00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:22.478\nYou see how you kind of get\nthat blue line between them?\n\n279\n00:13:22.478 --> 00:13:24.780\nI can hold down my Alt or Option key and\n\n280\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.540\nI'm gonna get that plus sign actually\nover an existing graphic style.\n\n281\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.140\nAnd what's gonna happen is it's\ngoing to replace that graphic style.\n\n282\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.905\nSo Vonne's shaking her head like,\nman, cool.\n\n283\n00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:39.878\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Seriously, I'm over here just\n\n284\n00:13:39.878 --> 00:13:44.600\namazed because I thought I know a lot\nabout graphic styles, I use them [SOUND].\n\n285\n00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.368\nI can't tell you how many things\nyou've taught me right there.\n\n286\n00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.929\nBecause all the different things,\nthe hello, the star,\n\n287\n00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:54.230\nand the circle, it's like it's attached.\n\n288\n00:13:54.230 --> 00:14:00.450\nIt knows that this is the style\nthat I am associating myself with.\n\n289\n00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.136\nAnd that's another thing, when you\nspecifically isolated that square,\n\n290\n00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:07.510\nchanged the orange.\n\n291\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.709\nIt didn't change anything else because\nthat's kind of doing like local overrides.\n\n292\n00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:13.351\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n293\n00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:15.174\n&gt;&gt; So like I do that, but\nnow I want to redefine the style,\n\n294\n00:14:15.174 --> 00:14:16.413\nI'm thinking in my InDesign terms.\n\n295\n00:14:16.413 --> 00:14:21.430\nTake that, everybody else that has this,\nyou're gonna now have these pieces.\n\n296\n00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:23.500\nI'm blown away.\n\n297\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.565\nI'm so happy right now I don't\nknow what to do with myself.\n\n298\n00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:27.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know.\n\n299\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.630\nGraphic styles can get\npretty cool like that.\n\n300\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.520\nThey're exciting.\n\n301\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.800\nBut that actually kinda brings me to\nanother point that I wanted to mention\n\n302\n00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.800\nwith this with tje kind of replacing.\n\n303\n00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.900\nSo I wanna do that again but I'm gonna\ndo something different here first, and\n\n304\n00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.070\nthen I am gonna break the link for\none of these graphic style.\n\n305\n00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:49.220\nSo say I wanna, all of these are natively\ntied to the graphic styles panel.\n\n306\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.680\nSo when you kinda update one,\nthey all kinda wanna update the other.\n\n307\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.300\nWhat if I wanna make sure\nthat one does not change?\n\n308\n00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.400\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclick on this little chain icon,\n\n309\n00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.800\nsee how you have the chain and\nthen you have the slash through it?\n\n310\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.660\nAnd you see if you hover over it,\nBreak Link To Graphic Style, so\n\n311\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.795\nI'm just gonna break the link to\nthe graphic style on that one.\n\n312\n00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:08.615\nAnd then I'm gonna do\nthe same thing again.\n\n313\n00:15:08.615 --> 00:15:12.600\nI'm gonna take this, I'm gonna click,\nhold, and drag, have my Alt key selected,\n\n314\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.485\nor Alt or Option key held down,\nreplace that graphic style in which you're\n\n315\n00:15:16.485 --> 00:15:21.375\ngonna see is it's not gonna change\nthat specific, I cannot say that word,\n\n316\n00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:25.115\nspecific one because I have\nbroken that link there.\n\n317\n00:15:25.115 --> 00:15:26.905\nSo that's something else that\nI would suggest that you pay\n\n318\n00:15:26.905 --> 00:15:28.655\nattention to with your\ngraphic styles as well.\n\n319\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.210\nWow, [LAUGH] I can feel the,\ni'ts coming back to me to say something.\n\n320\n00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.620\nI'm just like amazed and\n\n321\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.585\nI really am speechless of all the things\nI thought I knew about this and I didn't.\n\n322\n00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:44.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Please.\n\n323\n00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.726\nAnd the funny thing is, again, we were\nkinda joking at the beginning like graphic\n\n324\n00:15:47.726 --> 00:15:51.840\nstyles I think are something you use\nall the time, something that I teach.\n\n325\n00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.430\nBut professionally forget to use and\n\n326\n00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.490\nrealize just how much of\na time saver this would be.\n\n327\n00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.750\nIf there's something you mentioned,\nas simple as a drop shadow,\n\n328\n00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.850\nthat I just know that I'm going to\nwant to apply to different shapes,\n\n329\n00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.310\nI can just create it once and\nthen apply it to other different things.\n\n330\n00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.520\nSo it can save you so much time.\n\n331\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.780\nAnd it's just kind of fun.\n\n332\n00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.330\n&gt;&gt; Wow, yeah, and\nI guess one more thing I can add.\n\n333\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:12.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n334\n00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.880\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm like questioning,\ndo I know this for real?\n\n335\n00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.400\n&gt;&gt; Please.\n[LAUGH]\n\n336\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.280\n&gt;&gt; That styles are file specific, right.\n\n337\n00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.853\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So if I went ahead and\n\n338\n00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:24.667\ndid all this fancy stuff and then open\nup a new file or created a new file,\n\n339\n00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:29.020\nthen my graphic styles panel is\ngoing right back to the default.\n\n340\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.719\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n341\n00:16:29.719 --> 00:16:33.731\n&gt;&gt; And then it's like well we'll\nshow you how you can save them.\n\n342\n00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:37.280\nThis is actually I think the same for\nbrushes.\n\n343\n00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:37.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n344\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:38.530\nSwatches.\n\n345\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.970\n&gt;&gt; Swatches, styles,\nand symbols I believe.\n\n346\n00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:42.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n347\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.590\n&gt;&gt; But once we show you how to share one,\n\n348\n00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.830\nI think we're gonna do share\nswatches eventually, right?\n\n349\n00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:47.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n350\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.780\nIn that-\n&gt;&gt; CC libraries.\n\n351\n00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n352\n00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.250\nWhen we do that, just know that you\ncan apply that same thought process,\n\n353\n00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.370\nif you want to say, or\ntechnique of sharing out swatches.\n\n354\n00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.590\nYou can share out the brushes, and the\nstyles, and the symbols the same way and\n\n355\n00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.060\nbe able to kind of load them\nup into your other new files.\n\n356\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.775\nSo if you're getting super happy\nabout all this and want to move on,\n\n357\n00:17:08.775 --> 00:17:10.090\njust keep that in mind.\n\n358\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.910\nGood, I added something.\n\n359\n00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.845\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I know about styles in this episode\n\n360\n00:17:14.845 --> 00:17:18.194\nbecause you've taught me so\nmuch that I could go ahead and apply, and\n\n361\n00:17:18.194 --> 00:17:20.178\nI'm definitely going to be doing that.\n\n362\n00:17:20.178 --> 00:17:21.091\nSo thank you.\n\n363\n00:17:21.091 --> 00:17:21.763\nCool.\n\n364\n00:17:21.763 --> 00:17:23.288\n&gt;&gt; Can't thank you enough.\n\n365\n00:17:23.288 --> 00:17:25.378\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you guys for tuning in.\n\n366\n00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.742\nI hope you guys are gonna go have\nfun with your styles as well.\n\n367\n00:17:27.742 --> 00:17:32.382\nBut for now, signing off for CREATIVE\nPro.TV, I've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n368\n00:17:32.382 --> 00:17:33.122\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n369\n00:17:33.122 --> 00:17:34.423\n&gt;&gt; And we

edition of Creative Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.740\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and we're\ncontinuing on with Illustrator CC 2017,\n\n5\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.570\nand we're gonna be\ntalking all about masks.\n\n6\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.900\nOoh, it feels very Heidi-like.\n\n7\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.905\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n8\n00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Heidi-like,\nis that what we're gonna do?\n\n9\n00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:32.910\n[LAUGH] Yeah, well here to help us is Miss\nEmily Ramsey talk about our Heidi-ness.\n\n10\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.865\n&gt;&gt; Yes, our Heidi-ness.\n\n11\n00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:34.477\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sure [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:34.477 --> 00:00:35.986\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n13\n00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:38.253\n&gt;&gt; I can see where you're going with that.\n\n14\n00:00:38.253 --> 00:00:39.631\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's like Phantom of the Opera.\n\n15\n00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:40.239\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n16\n00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.094\n&gt;&gt; Sure that sounds very dramatic.\n\n17\n00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:43.043\n&gt;&gt; I wanna start singing,\nbut I'd better not.\n\n18\n00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.183\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:44.183 --> 00:00:44.683\n&gt;&gt; Okay, stop.\n\n20\n00:00:44.683 --> 00:00:45.494\n[LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:47.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe not.\n\n22\n00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.720\nSo what we're gonna get into, we are going\nto be talking about working with masks.\n\n23\n00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.772\nIt sounds so mysterious.\n\n24\n00:00:53.772 --> 00:00:57.452\nWe're gonna kind of use a couple of\ndifferent examples of how these can apply\n\n25\n00:00:57.452 --> 00:00:59.131\nand why you would want to use them.\n\n26\n00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:03.751\nBut I think is gonna best work when we're\ntalking about our opacity masks, and\n\n27\n00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.750\nour clipping masks, is if we start\nout with the concept of an image.\n\n28\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.774\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ngrab here, my cat is back.\n\n29\n00:01:11.774 --> 00:01:15.340\nAnd we are going to start\noff with our clipping mask.\n\n30\n00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.990\nSo clipping masks are kinda cool.\n\n31\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.550\nIt's kind of funny,\nthey basically back in the day,\n\n32\n00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.550\nbefore cropping existed which\nonly happened pretty recently.\n\n33\n00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.820\nThey were basically your way of\ncropping an image in Illustrator.\n\n34\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.010\nSo what we can do here through,\n\n35\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.300\nsince we no longer need to crop\nan image using an clipping mask.\n\n36\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.270\nI can say okay, I've got that crop option,\nit's not obsolete.\n\n37\n00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.760\nBut we are just gonna use it\nin a slightly different way.\n\n38\n00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.400\nSo I am gonna take my image.\n\n39\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.450\nNow, this does not have\nto be done on an image.\n\n40\n00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.370\nYou can apply it to vectors and we'll\nkind of show you some examples of that.\n\n41\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.357\nI am just using the example\nof an image here.\n\n42\n00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:52.267\nWhat if I wanted to make\nthis image a circle?\n\n43\n00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:55.493\nI can crop something, but\ni can't crop an image into a circle.\n\n44\n00:01:55.493 --> 00:01:56.940\nSo what I am gonna do?\n\n45\n00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.014\nI am gonna go ahead and\ngrab my ellipse tool.\n\n46\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.790\nAnd then I'm just gonna drag it\nright over my little guy's face.\n\n47\n00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.950\nI'm gonna take that gradient away,\nthat'll come into play in a minute.\n\n48\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.490\nBut what I'm gonna do,\nI'm just gonna say, okay,\n\n49\n00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.520\nI want that to be kind\nof right about there.\n\n50\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.883\nPoor little guy's little belly is sticking\nout, I'm just cutting the fat here.\n\n51\n00:02:15.883 --> 00:02:21.959\n[LAUGH] So what we're gonna say now,\nnow I have a vector on top of a raster.\n\n52\n00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.709\nThe only key part of that Is that\nonly the vector can actually\n\n53\n00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.290\ncreate a clipping mask.\n\n54\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.540\nSo I could not flip this\nis what I'm saying.\n\n55\n00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.250\nI couldn't have a circle\nwith a picture on top of it.\n\n56\n00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.080\nAnd then to create our clipping mask,\nwhat I'm gonna do I'm gonna select\n\n57\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.020\nboth of those objects,\nhowever you wanna select both of them.\n\n58\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.889\nAnd then it's actually\njust a right-click option.\n\n59\n00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.530\nSo I'm gonna right-click and\nthen Make Clipping Mask.\n\n60\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.930\nI think this one's also available\nunder your Object menu.\n\n61\n00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.800\nSomewhere down there you have\nObject &gt; Clipping Mask &gt; Make.\n\n62\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.540\nSo we can go ahead and choose that,\nwhatever method you want to use.\n\n63\n00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.540\nMake Clipping Mask and now it's gonna\nconvert my image into a circle.\n\n64\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.646\nSo basically whatever's\nunderneath the topmost vector,\n\n65\n00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:03.786\nin my case I had a circle on top.\n\n66\n00:03:03.786 --> 00:03:08.051\nAnything that's underneath it is gonna\ntake the shape of that object that\n\n67\n00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:08.757\nwas on top.\n\n68\n00:03:08.757 --> 00:03:11.846\nAnd again that object on\ntop can only be a vector.\n\n69\n00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:15.471\nBut you can have multiple things\nunderneath it and fun stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:15.471 --> 00:03:17.418\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nI like the idea of a mask right?\n\n71\n00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:21.212\nWhen you put a mask on your face,\nwhatever,\n\n72\n00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:24.402\nthe circular cut outs for your eyes.\n\n73\n00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:29.990\nYour eyes show through that area,\nand it hides everything else.\n\n74\n00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.410\nSo it's not that we've removed any\nof the information of Mr. Ollie.\n\n75\n00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.018\nIt's just that we're hiding it.\n\n76\n00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:39.639\nThis is the area that's\ngoing to show through.\n\n77\n00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.548\nEverything else is going to be hidden, so\n\n78\n00:03:42.548 --> 00:03:47.545\nthat show-hide aspect of a mask is,\nwell, the whole concept of mask.\n\n79\n00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:49.443\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, and\nI think that's a great point.\n\n80\n00:03:49.443 --> 00:03:51.558\nThat's why it's referred to as a mask and\nyou can even see it.\n\n81\n00:03:51.558 --> 00:03:54.322\nIf I hover over this, you still\nsee the dimensions of that image.\n\n82\n00:03:54.322 --> 00:03:56.435\nSo we have not taken the image away.\n\n83\n00:03:56.435 --> 00:03:58.465\nIn fact, I can go ahead and\nkind of edit this.\n\n84\n00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:01.797\nSo if I wanna double-click,\ngo into Isolation mode, and I'm like,\n\n85\n00:04:01.797 --> 00:04:04.402\nyou know what,\nI don't want to see exactly that part.\n\n86\n00:04:04.402 --> 00:04:07.735\nMaybe I wanna move them\nslightly over here,\n\n87\n00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:12.360\nI can even not only edit\nwhat's being masked, my image.\n\n88\n00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.980\nI can actually edit the mask itself.\n\n89\n00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.017\nSo just depending on what you click,\nif I wanna select that mask,\n\n90\n00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:18.794\nI can make that smaller for instance.\n\n91\n00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:22.730\nSo if I wanna make it a smaller circle,\nthat is an option that I have.\n\n92\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.896\nNow, let's say I am gonna double-click\nto get out of isolation mode, so\n\n93\n00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:27.490\njust double-click off to the side.\n\n94\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.163\nNow let's say I'm working on this, and\nI really just don't want the mask anymore.\n\n95\n00:04:32.163 --> 00:04:35.900\nI kinda wanna get rid of it,\nI wanna see the whole cat, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.070\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna right-click, and\n\n97\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.390\njust in the same way that you can make\na clipping mask, you can release it.\n\n98\n00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.520\nJust as Vonne was saying, it has not gone\naway, it's just being hidden right now.\n\n99\n00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.100\nSo if I could choose that release\nclipping mask, what you're gonna see,\n\n100\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.360\nI still have that circle on top.\n\n101\n00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.696\nBasically, anything that you\nhad on top to create your mask,\n\n102\n00:04:54.696 --> 00:04:57.337\nit's gonna convert to no fill,\nand no strokes.\n\n103\n00:04:57.337 --> 00:04:59.351\nSo do you wanna use that later?\n\n104\n00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:02.996\nYou can, if I want to go ahead and say,\nokay, I'm gonna put that over here, or\n\n105\n00:05:02.996 --> 00:05:05.780\nif you just wanted to get rid of it,\nthat's also an option.\n\n106\n00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.058\nNow, just to show you,\nyou can use this for other vectors, or\n\n107\n00:05:10.058 --> 00:05:12.792\nagain, multiple different objects.\n\n108\n00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:17.534\nSo typically, if I have something going\non, maybe there's like a lot going on in\n\n109\n00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:21.180\nmy artboard and I just kinda wanna\ntrim things up a little bit.\n\n110\n00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.350\nSometimes I'll have like images hanging\noff to the side, or maybe I'll create,\n\n111\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.110\nI'll use the example of a star.\n\n112\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.930\nMaybe I have a star, but I want it to only\nappear on my artboard as if just that one\n\n113\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.500\nlittle portion, or a circle,\nor something like this.\n\n114\n00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.510\nSo I have all these things\nkinda hanging off my artboard.\n\n115\n00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.590\nSometimes what I'll do when I'm\nkinda finalizing my file, just so\n\n116\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.871\nI can give myself an idea\nof what it will look like.\n\n117\n00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:48.991\nI'll just create a clipping\nmask over the entire thing.\n\n118\n00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:51.690\nSo I can go here, grab my Rectangle tool.\n\n119\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.500\nI'm gonna drag and drop that so\nthat it's about the size of my artboard.\n\n120\n00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.720\nI'm not worrying about\nperfection right here.\n\n121\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.260\nAnd I'm just gonna\nMake Clipping Mask again.\n\n122\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.910\nSo I'm gonna select all these objects,\nright-click, Make Clipping Mask.\n\n123\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.185\nAnd then now I can say, okay,\n\n124\n00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:09.513\nthat's gonna give me more of an idea of\nwhat this is actually gonna look like.\n\n125\n00:06:09.513 --> 00:06:12.580\nWhen I go and save my file as a PDF,\nor whatever output I need.\n\n126\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.507\nAnd I can say you know what,\nI don't really like that star.\n\n127\n00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:19.565\nI'm gonna double-click, Edit, maybe I,\noops, didn't mean to do that like that.\n\n128\n00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:22.326\nI meant to rotate,\nmaybe I wanna do something like that.\n\n129\n00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:25.419\nAnd I can go ahead and say okay,\nthat looks a little bit better.\n\n130\n00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.637\nAnd it gives me again,\n\n131\n00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:30.621\njust an idea of what's something's\ngonna look like in the final output.\n\n132\n00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:34.047\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm over here just\nsmiling away because I'm like,\n\n133\n00:06:34.047 --> 00:06:36.738\nyeah this is the example\nI show a lot of people.\n\n134\n00:06:36.738 --> 00:06:37.306\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n135\n00:06:37.306 --> 00:06:38.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n136\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.232\none step further that I do on this method,\njust to avoid having\n\n137\n00:06:43.232 --> 00:06:47.930\nto go into isolation mode is\nI'll make in its own layer too.\n\n138\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.829\nAnd that way I can kind of lock or\nhide that layer when needed.\n\n139\n00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:54.418\nBecause sometimes I need to see\neverything like hanging off the artboard.\n\n140\n00:06:54.418 --> 00:06:57.683\nAnd it's almost like a final preview,\nif you wanna say, so\n\n141\n00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.700\nyou turn that layer back off.\n\n142\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.870\nI'll make a really big rectangle, and\n\n143\n00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.900\nthen the rectangle that's\nthe size of the artboard.\n\n144\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.923\nAnd so that way, super,\nsuper big, way off the artboard.\n\n145\n00:07:09.923 --> 00:07:15.500\nAnother small one, use that of the two\nrectangles being the clipping mask.\n\n146\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.994\nAnd then, that's its own layer to be\nable to kinda turn off and on, there-\n\n147\n00:07:19.994 --> 00:07:21.170\n&gt;&gt; So something like this.\n\n148\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.211\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I actually remember you doing this.\n\n149\n00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:23.997\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day.\n\n150\n00:07:23.997 --> 00:07:25.901\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you go like this,\n\n151\n00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:27.203\nyou Make Clipping Mask.\n\n152\n00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:29.496\nAnd then what she's saying is,\nshe goes ahead and\n\n153\n00:07:29.496 --> 00:07:31.413\njust kinda creates that on its own layer.\n\n154\n00:07:31.413 --> 00:07:31.913\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n155\n00:07:31.913 --> 00:07:34.487\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that way, I can go ahead and\n\n156\n00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:37.599\nor flip it, however, I would do it.\n&gt;&gt; Some way.\n\n157\n00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:38.267\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:39.381\n&gt;&gt; How did I do that?\n\n159\n00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:39.923\nYeah, okay,\n\n160\n00:07:39.923 --> 00:07:41.269\nsomething like that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n161\n00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:42.138\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it will work.\n\n162\n00:07:42.138 --> 00:07:42.863\n&gt;&gt; Or flip and it-\n\n163\n00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:43.920\n&gt;&gt; You can make it compound,\n\n164\n00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.006\nbut if you wanna do something similar\nto that you could make a compound path.\n\n165\n00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:47.559\n&gt;&gt; A compound path.\n\n166\n00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:48.755\n&gt;&gt; And it will knock the hole,\n\n167\n00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:49.956\nif I made this.\n\n168\n00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:52.065\n&gt;&gt; You can use your eyedropper tool and\nmake that.\n\n169\n00:07:52.065 --> 00:07:54.116\nI know we're going off\non a total tangent but\n\n170\n00:07:54.116 --> 00:07:55.815\nit is something you could also-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n171\n00:07:55.815 --> 00:08:00.260\nI just blended two concepts into one and\nso you know what, it's a compound path.\n\n172\n00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.950\nIt's not a clipping mask, but\nthey can be kinda confusing in that sense.\n\n173\n00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.821\nBut a compound path knocks the hole out,\nbut\n\n174\n00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:10.246\nthe clipping mask is what\nyou want to see through it.\n\n175\n00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:11.107\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n176\n00:08:11.107 --> 00:08:13.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm getting myself confused.\n\n177\n00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.226\nI don't wanna confuse you either.\n\n178\n00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:15.875\nSo I'm gonna stop unless you keep going.\n\n179\n00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:18.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all right.\n\n180\n00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.962\nIt's all good but I think actually,\nyou kinda learn good something from that.\n\n181\n00:08:21.962 --> 00:08:24.601\n&gt;&gt; So even if you're like,\nwhat just happened?\n\n182\n00:08:24.601 --> 00:08:25.724\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Compound path,\n\n183\n00:08:25.724 --> 00:08:29.326\nif you wanna create something where you\ncan kinda do basically the same effect.\n\n184\n00:08:29.326 --> 00:08:32.366\nI can have my star going\noff to the side here, and\n\n185\n00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.953\nI won't keep us on too much of a tangent.\n\n186\n00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:39.310\nBut I can kinda see okay what\nthat would look like, so yeah.\n\n187\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.213\n&gt;&gt; Carry on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:08:40.213 --> 00:08:41.890\n&gt;&gt; That is what she was trying to say.\n\n189\n00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.490\nSo we will take our clipping mask.\n\n190\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.180\nAnd our clipping mask again is just\ngoing to be any time I want something\n\n191\n00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.885\nbelow it to take the shape\nof what is on top.\n\n192\n00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:53.381\nNow, we will move onto something\nsimilar called opacity mask.\n\n193\n00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:55.368\nSo in order to get my opacity mask,\n\n194\n00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.321\nI think at some point I\ndeleted my picture of my cat.\n\n195\n00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:03.100\nHe'd be so offended, if I go ahead and\nI'm just gonna Cmd or Ctrl+Z so\n\n196\n00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.320\nI can get that back, there he is,\nto show you an opacity mask.\n\n197\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.720\nSo with an opacity mask I'm gonna\ndo kind of a similar setup here.\n\n198\n00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.670\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna grab the Ellipse Tool.\n\n199\n00:09:16.977 --> 00:09:22.790\nAnd then this time, and you'll even see it\ncreated automatically for me last time.\n\n200\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.770\nI need to go ahead and\nput a gradient on it.\n\n201\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.660\nSo this is where it gets kinda fancy.\n\n202\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.580\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ngrab my Gradient panel, and\n\n203\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.070\nthen all I need is that default.\n\n204\n00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.770\nI just need black and white.\n\n205\n00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.700\nWhen we work on our opacity masks,\nwe're gonna have black equals hide and\n\n206\n00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.350\nwhite equals show.\n\n207\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.119\nSo that may not make sense right now, but\nwhat we can look at here if I take this.\n\n208\n00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:45.053\nAnd I'm gonna grab both objects,\n\n209\n00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:48.528\nagain very similar to how we're\nsetting up our opacity mask.\n\n210\n00:09:48.528 --> 00:09:52.224\nNow I wanna go next door\nto that Transparency panel.\n\n211\n00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:54.434\nSo grab your Transparency panel,\nhowever you find it.\n\n212\n00:09:54.434 --> 00:09:57.624\nWindow, go to Transparency,\nyou can also find it,\n\n213\n00:09:57.624 --> 00:10:00.680\nit's kind of the two circles\non top of each other.\n\n214\n00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.216\nI keep meaning to drag these out, so\nyou can actually read the labels there,\n\n215\n00:10:04.216 --> 00:10:04.890\nthere you go.\n\n216\n00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.350\nAnd what we see when I have both options,\nI'm gonna go ahead and select Make Mask.\n\n217\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.520\nNow, not only did this\nactually clip my shape, but\n\n218\n00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.450\nit also added some effects\nof transparency there to it.\n\n219\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.940\nSo it went ahead and kinda faded out.\n\n220\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.880\nAnd remember that part\nthat was black before?\n\n221\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.042\nWe had that white gradient over here,\nthe black color stopped over here.\n\n222\n00:10:27.042 --> 00:10:29.703\nThat part has now faded into transparency.\n\n223\n00:10:29.703 --> 00:10:32.320\nSo what I can do,\nI can take this over here.\n\n224\n00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.890\nAnd you see it's not white,\nit's actually fading into nothing.\n\n225\n00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.396\nI could put something green behind this,\nfor example, and\n\n226\n00:10:39.396 --> 00:10:42.140\nit would look like it\nwas fading into nothing.\n\n227\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:48.000\nSo that's the option that you have\nwith this Opacity mask, so grab that.\n\n228\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.020\nI'm gonna go into\nthe Transparency panel again,\n\n229\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.830\njust to show you a couple a couple\nof things in terms of editing.\n\n230\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.180\nSo one, you have the option,\nyou see here it's set at Normal.\n\n231\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.210\nThat's just gonna affect\nthe blending mode.\n\n232\n00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.530\nAgain, this is one of those that's just\ntotally gonna depend on what you're doing.\n\n233\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.350\nAnd I would say it's not worth\nthe time for me to go through and\n\n234\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.190\nsay, here's what each one of them does,\njust kind of play around with it.\n\n235\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.260\nYou can adjust the Opacity there,\nof course.\n\n236\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.590\nNow one thing I wanted to mention too,\nis that you can clip this, or not clip it.\n\n237\n00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.760\nSo right now, you see that it\ntook away the rest of my image,\n\n238\n00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.970\nbasically, or not took away,\nit masked the rest of my image.\n\n239\n00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.770\nAll right, turn off that Clip option.\n\n240\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.699\nYou're gonna be able to go ahead and\nsee the rest of your image there.\n\n241\n00:11:24.699 --> 00:11:27.661\nYou're still gonna have\nthat kind of transparency.\n\n242\n00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:30.540\nIt's just all looking a little\nbit different, basically.\n\n243\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.442\nSo depending on what you want to do,\nyou can turn that clip on and off.\n\n244\n00:11:33.442 --> 00:11:35.240\nYou can also Invert Mask.\n\n245\n00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.290\nIf I wanna flip the part that is white,\nor the part this is shown\n\n246\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.120\nversus the part that is hidden,\nthat's also an option to do.\n\n247\n00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.070\nNow what do I say if I actually want\nto just adjust that mask entirely?\n\n248\n00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.970\nNow this is the one part that gets\na little bit tricky because you\n\n249\n00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.400\nhave to be aware of where\nyou are selecting things.\n\n250\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.310\nSo right now I've been doing all of this\n\n251\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.660\nwith actually this part on\nthe left-hand side that I've selected.\n\n252\n00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.580\nThis kind of preview of my cat\nbasically is what I have selected, so\n\n253\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.500\nI have that there.\n\n254\n00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.090\nNow, its a very subtle change,\n\n255\n00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.470\nI don't feel like they really\npoint it out to you enough.\n\n256\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.090\nBut if you go ahead and select over here,\nokay, now I'm actually adjusting the mask.\n\n257\n00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.500\nAnd that's going to come into play later\nwhen you forget that you have the mask\n\n258\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.140\nselected.\n\n259\n00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.069\nSo I can go here, maybe make that\na little bit larger or do whatever.\n\n260\n00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:25.693\nOr I could also just maybe use my Gradient\ntool to adjust how I want that to appear,\n\n261\n00:12:25.693 --> 00:12:29.210\nmaybe I wanted it to be top to bottom.\n\n262\n00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.440\nHowever you wanna adjust it, radial,\nsomething like that, you can change.\n\n263\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.350\nNow, where do people get tripped up?\n\n264\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.462\nThey forget that they\nhave that mask selected.\n\n265\n00:12:37.462 --> 00:12:39.870\nSo you try and go and\ndo something else, and you're like,\n\n266\n00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.640\nwhy does that keep moving?\n\n267\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.015\nOr even, I think, if you try and\ncreate other shapes, it's just,\n\n268\n00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:47.043\nsee how I just tried to draw a rectangle?\n\n269\n00:12:47.043 --> 00:12:49.517\nAnd it went ahead and\nkinda masked over there?\n\n270\n00:12:49.517 --> 00:12:53.063\nAnd it becomes very frustrating if\nyou don't know what's going on.\n\n271\n00:12:53.063 --> 00:12:58.193\nAnd all the issue is, is that you\nhave that actual mask selected,\n\n272\n00:12:58.193 --> 00:13:02.870\nyou don't have the actual image,\nif you will, selected.\n\n273\n00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.640\nI forget what they actually call it.\n\n274\n00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.368\nBut this is the mask, that's gonna\nbe kind of your image on its own.\n\n275\n00:13:08.368 --> 00:13:12.132\nAnd now, I can go here and\ndraw a rectangle or something like that.\n\n276\n00:13:12.132 --> 00:13:13.390\nIt's gonna be unaffected.\n\n277\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.380\nSo Opacity masks\nare definitely kind of fun.\n\n278\n00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.453\nAgain, we're using the example of an image\nhere because I do think that an Opacity\n\n279\n00:13:20.453 --> 00:13:22.840\nmask is probably gonna be\nmore effective on an image.\n\n280\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.340\nBut if you go back to things\nlike our clipping mask,\n\n281\n00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.370\njust remember that you can\napply them on anything.\n\n282\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.030\nImages are a great example of\na time when you may use them.\n\n283\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.576\nBut we also talked about some\nother ideas that you wanna use.\n\n284\n00:13:33.576 --> 00:13:38.253\nSo I would say, enjoy your masking,\nenjoy the mystery with that, and\n\n285\n00:13:38.253 --> 00:13:39.770\nhave some fun with it.\n\n286\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.472\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and hopefully I didn't cause too\nmuch mystery of throwing in the compound\n\n287\n00:13:43.472 --> 00:13:45.659\npath and like, yeah, that's what I did.\n\n288\n00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:51.190\nYeah, but it did kind of, it harkened\nthat in me to say, I used to do that.\n\n289\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.360\nAnd go ahead and put that layer and\neverything like that.\n\n290\n00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.853\nBut it's okay, I'm glad that you're\nhere to help us get on the path and\n\n291\n00:13:58.853 --> 00:14:00.330\nstay on that path.\n\n292\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.100\nAnd master very cool, and\nbe able to show and hide.\n\n293\n00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.482\nThe biggest thing on the opacity thing\nthat I always need to remember black hide,\n\n294\n00:14:07.482 --> 00:14:10.680\nwhite show, and\nwhich way I'm dragging the gradient.\n\n295\n00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.680\nI repeat that to myself as I'm drawing\n\n296\n00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.375\nthe gradient to remember what I want\nto show and what I want to hide.\n\n297\n00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:22.507\nSo thank you so much for\nthat great introduction to everything.\n\n298\n00:14:22.507 --> 00:14:25.167\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n299\n00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:28.620\nSigning off for CreativePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n300\n00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.459\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n301\n00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:30.853\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n302\n00:14:30.853 -->

[LAUGH] That's all, and no.\n\n16\n00:00:38.714 --> 00:00:43.175\nMesh and recolor, so\nmuch more exciting than it sounds, right?\n\n17\n00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:47.343\nSo, this is gonna be something,\nyou can probably gather from\n\n18\n00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:51.605\nthe re-color portion of this,\nmesh has to do a lot with color.\n\n19\n00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:54.410\nSo what we're seeing,\nit's almost like a gray gradient.\n\n20\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.480\nThe tool actually also used to\nbe referred to gradient mesh.\n\n21\n00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.060\nAnd then at some point along the way\nthey dropped the gradient and\n\n22\n00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.620\njust called it the mesh tool.\n\n23\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.170\nBut we're gonna use it to mix colors and\nuse it to make some new and\n\n24\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.230\nexciting gradient.\n\n25\n00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.959\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n26\n00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:13.327\nWhat I wanna do here, I wanna use\nthe example of a circle, you do you,\n\n27\n00:01:13.327 --> 00:01:17.470\nwhatever you want, I just like the example\nof a circle, particularly for this one.\n\n28\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.722\nAnd then go ahead and give it some\nsort of a color that you like.\n\n29\n00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:24.780\nSo if you're kind of thinking, okay,\nthink like you're making a gradient.\n\n30\n00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.676\nThere's gonna be some kind of\nlike dominate color, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:32.303\nSo in my case, I'm gonna go with kind of\nwhat I want to be like Background color,\n\n32\n00:01:32.303 --> 00:01:33.074\nif you will.\n\n33\n00:01:33.074 --> 00:01:37.504\nThis is all adjustable later, yadda\nyadda yadda, but I'm gonna go here and\n\n34\n00:01:37.504 --> 00:01:41.120\nI'm gonna say okay,\nI want something that's gonna be blue.\n\n35\n00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.068\nI'm gonna get really\ncreative on my colors here.\n\n36\n00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:47.304\nOne of these days I'll pick something\nother that pink, or blue, or orange.\n\n37\n00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:48.981\nSo we're gonna go with that here.\n\n38\n00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:52.124\nAnd from there we need\nto grab our mesh tool.\n\n39\n00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:53.302\nNow our mesh tool, well,\n\n40\n00:01:53.302 --> 00:01:56.794\nfirst of all make sure you have the\nselected with your block arrow tool first.\n\n41\n00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:59.287\nI think maybe I clicked off it there.\n\n42\n00:01:59.287 --> 00:02:03.246\nSo I have it selected with my block arrow\ntool then I'm grabbing my mesh tool.\n\n43\n00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:05.055\nNow my mesh tool is kind of a funny one.\n\n44\n00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:10.228\nIt almost acts like your white arrow tool\nin that you're going to be adding points.\n\n45\n00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:11.998\nNow you're not necessarily adding points.\n\n46\n00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:17.292\nIn the same way that you would with add\nanchor point, or anything like that.\n\n47\n00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:19.444\nYou're actually adding mesh points.\n\n48\n00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:23.496\nAnd we're gonna use these mesh\npoints to interact with color.\n\n49\n00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:27.009\nNow you're gonna see those\nBezier handles again.\n\n50\n00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:28.337\nSo don't let me lose you.\n\n51\n00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:31.500\nDon't get scared cuz you\nsee a Bezier handle.\n\n52\n00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.691\nIt's actually gonna be pretty cool.\n\n53\n00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:36.425\nNow, with this you wanna\nbe careful how many you do.\n\n54\n00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:39.925\nWhen you create one, it's kinda\ngonna create another one for you.\n\n55\n00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:44.437\nSo it's like a, I don't know if the word\nI'm going for here, but it's like a-\n\n56\n00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:45.430\n&gt;&gt; Well it creates a grid.\n\n57\n00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.857\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yin Yang.\n\n58\n00:02:46.857 --> 00:02:47.753\nYeah, it creates a grid.\nThank you.\n\n59\n00:02:47.753 --> 00:02:50.904\n&gt;&gt; You create one, then it's going\nto create an x and a Yy basically.\n\n60\n00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.606\nSo one across, one going down.\n\n61\n00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.293\nAnd that's where the point is.\n\n62\n00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:56.015\n&gt;&gt; And so it kind of-\n&gt;&gt; A mesh.\n\n63\n00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:56.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n64\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n65\n00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.673\n&gt;&gt; Just like a,\nI'm thinking like chicken wire.\n\n66\n00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:00.782\nLike a mesh wire.\n\n67\n00:03:00.782 --> 00:03:04.118\nThat's what we're going to be creating.\n\n68\n00:03:04.118 --> 00:03:04.693\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:04.693 --> 00:03:06.995\n&gt;&gt; And then we're going, and\nthen I'll stop right there-\n\n70\n00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:07.575\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n71\n00:03:07.575 --> 00:03:09.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, I was like keep going,\n\n72\n00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:10.633\nI love it, yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.228\nMade a lot more sense than my Ying and\nYang example.\n\n74\n00:03:13.228 --> 00:03:14.793\nI was going down a bad path.\n\n75\n00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:18.258\nBut yeah, we're creating a mesh,\nas the name implies.\n\n76\n00:03:18.258 --> 00:03:21.855\nSo yeah, you have to kind of think about\nit like that, so what I'm gonna do, and\n\n77\n00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:23.359\nyou can do whatever you want, but\n\n78\n00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.140\nI would suggest just kinda\nfollow my lead on this one.\n\n79\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.720\nI'm gonna make a single click\nin the top left hand corner and\n\n80\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.985\na single click in the bottom\nright hand corner.\n\n81\n00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:34.240\nCuz I'm gonna make that grid,\nI don't need to make all four points.\n\n82\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.546\nOr I could make more than that,\nbut I don't want to.\n\n83\n00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:40.482\nWhat I'm gonna do, just single-click,\nnot necessarily on my path.\n\n84\n00:03:40.482 --> 00:03:41.872\nI'm not clicking on that.\n\n85\n00:03:41.872 --> 00:03:46.030\nI'm just gonna go somewhere generally\nin the top left-hand corner, so\n\n86\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.403\nsomewhere about here.\n\n87\n00:03:47.403 --> 00:03:52.402\nAnd then somewhere generally in the bottom\nright-hand corner, so somewhere like that.\n\n88\n00:03:52.402 --> 00:03:56.745\nNow you'll see, it made that grid for\nme, and you can see here,\n\n89\n00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:59.006\nI have kind of those Mesh points.\n\n90\n00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.670\nIt kinda looks like our points that we\nused with the white arrow tool, right?\n\n91\n00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.660\nAnd not to get too far ahead of ourselves,\nbut this is actually something I can\n\n92\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.820\nchange with my white arrow tool,\nbut we'll get to that in a second.\n\n93\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.220\nSo we see we have these Bezier handles.\n\n94\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.910\nYou can actually move these things around.\n\n95\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.922\nYou don't see anything right now, because\nI don't have any additional color applied.\n\n96\n00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:20.287\nAnd it's not necessarily changing our\npath really, what I'm looking at here,\n\n97\n00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:24.459\nyou know what I'm gonna be focusing on\ntoday is really just how this interacts\n\n98\n00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.245\nwith colors.\n\n99\n00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:28.428\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect one of these mesh points.\n\n100\n00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:31.743\nAnd then, what I'm gonna go do, I'm\njust gonna jump in to my swatches panel.\n\n101\n00:04:31.743 --> 00:04:32.921\nSo we're talking about color,\n\n102\n00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:35.372\nwe can't talk about color without\ntalking about swatches panel.\n\n103\n00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:37.753\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njump over here and just grab a color.\n\n104\n00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:39.156\nLike, maybe I want that green.\n\n105\n00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:42.444\nOr maybe I want purple,\nor something like that.\n\n106\n00:04:42.444 --> 00:04:44.090\nGet really crazy.\n\n107\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.942\nThen jump over here, select one of my\nother mesh points and go ahead and\n\n108\n00:04:48.942 --> 00:04:51.831\ngrab orange, or whatever you want to do.\n\n109\n00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:53.863\nAnd you can just go around and\n\n110\n00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:59.464\nselect all of your mesh points until you\nget something that looks kinda funky.\n\n111\n00:04:59.464 --> 00:05:02.950\nMine's kind of going rainbow but\nyou see why and you know depending on how,\n\n112\n00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.052\nyou see why I did that\nblue background color,\n\n113\n00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:07.895\nyou wouldn't want to do like a black or\nsomething like that.\n\n114\n00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:10.854\nYou want to go with something that's\ngonna go with your color scheme.\n\n115\n00:05:10.854 --> 00:05:12.830\nNow I know my color scheme is rainbow.\n\n116\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.638\nBut you kinda want to have something\nthat goes with your scheme,\n\n117\n00:05:15.638 --> 00:05:17.825\nbecause you are going to\nsee that original color.\n\n118\n00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:18.980\nNow I say that.\n\n119\n00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.172\nThat depends on how many\nmesh points I wanna add.\n\n120\n00:05:21.172 --> 00:05:23.204\nHow many mesh points I wanna alter.\n\n121\n00:05:23.204 --> 00:05:26.778\nBecause I have the option to\nreally change and affect that.\n\n122\n00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:28.809\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou can use gradient meshes like this.\n\n123\n00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:30.192\nEven just that first one.\n\n124\n00:05:30.192 --> 00:05:34.907\nIt always reminds me of drawing,\nwhich I was horrible at, honestly.\n\n125\n00:05:34.907 --> 00:05:39.392\nWhere you draw a circle and\nmake it look like an actual sphere,\n\n126\n00:05:39.392 --> 00:05:43.355\nwith the light point and\nthe shadows somewhere else.\n\n127\n00:05:43.355 --> 00:05:48.687\nI could never make it look like\na realistically shaped circle thing.\n\n128\n00:05:48.687 --> 00:05:53.313\nBut that right there,\nI've watched gradient mesh tutorials-\n\n129\n00:05:53.313 --> 00:05:54.144\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n130\n00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:59.058\n&gt;&gt; And where it creates the most\nrealistic looking objects but\n\n131\n00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:03.883\nit's all flat vector work and\nit's absolutely amazing.\n\n132\n00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:06.329\nI always do things like this and\n\n133\n00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:12.020\nthis reminds me of like the marbles\nwith all the colors inside of them.\n\n134\n00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.741\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n135\n00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:14.317\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is where kinda back to the childhood.\n\n136\n00:06:14.317 --> 00:06:17.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doing the whole kindergarten that kind\n\n137\n00:06:17.146 --> 00:06:20.395\nof stuff and my\n&gt;&gt; My aunt had the most amazing collection\n\n138\n00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:23.134\nof these and\nI was just fascinated by it, so\n\n139\n00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:25.735\nit kind of throws it all together for me.\n\n140\n00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:29.981\nBut it's just so cool to see how it's\nblending and it's doing the gradient but\n\n141\n00:06:29.981 --> 00:06:33.456\nit's all based on those mesh points\nwhere you apply the color and\n\n142\n00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:36.560\nthen how they all blend together,\nso it's pretty neat.\n\n143\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.786\nAnd like you said,\nyou can move those points.\n\n144\n00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:40.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To make them kinda swirl then do\n\n145\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.100\nwhatever.\n\n146\n00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I wanted to swirl\nthis around a little bit more,\n\n147\n00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.580\nI could move it to my heart's content.\n\n148\n00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.020\nAnd I mentioned I can move\nthis with my white air tool.\n\n149\n00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.079\nYou're not limited to just your mesh tool.\n\n150\n00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:52.700\nI like to just keep things\nfrom being confusing,\n\n151\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.760\nI typically just do this\nall in my mesh tool.\n\n152\n00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.360\nI don't leave and go to the white arrow\ntool, because I just don't really need to.\n\n153\n00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.920\nBut I could if I jumped straight\ninto my wide arrow tool.\n\n154\n00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.720\nI could still do the same thing, I could\ngrab a point with my wide arrow tool, and\n\n155\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.040\nthen go and change the color.\n\n156\n00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.590\nSo it is still an option that\nyou have available to you.\n\n157\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.490\n&gt;&gt; And if you click off of this now\njust so you can see it without the mesh,\n\n158\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.230\nyou can see now this looks well,\n\n159\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.670\na bunch of colors blended in together with\nalmost like a blue outline in a sense.\n\n160\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.086\nBut you can see how you can swirl them and\nmove them around and\n\n161\n00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:27.765\nbe able to use that kinda shading\nto really get some interesting\n\n162\n00:07:27.765 --> 00:07:32.906\neffects on flat 2D art work that\nalmost looks three-dimensional.\n\n163\n00:07:32.906 --> 00:07:36.340\nI'm not that good with both the lost\nof shading and everything of that but\n\n164\n00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.001\nI watch other people do it and\nI think it's really cool.\n\n165\n00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:40.079\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n166\n00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:41.871\n[LAUGH] That counts for something, right?\n\n167\n00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:42.599\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, I think and\n\n168\n00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:43.672\nI totally agree with you.\n\n169\n00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:48.275\nYou can see some things that if you would\nnot even necessarily believe that that is\n\n170\n00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:52.875\nactually a vector and not a photo because\nit comes to that photo realistic through\n\n171\n00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:54.310\nthe use of the mesh tool.\n\n172\n00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.020\nThis is where you can start to make\nthings look a little bit more natural.\n\n173\n00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.220\nAnd I think that kinda\nleads us to a good point,\n\n174\n00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.360\nin terms of making this look\na little bit more natural.\n\n175\n00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.210\nSo what I wanna do here,\nI have this mesh, but\n\n176\n00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.120\nI'm not really loving the colors\nthat I've got going on.\n\n177\n00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.180\nIt's a little rainbow-y,\n\n178\n00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.840\nwhat if I wanted to do something like\nthat shadow Vonne was mentioning.\n\n179\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.840\nYes, I can go here and I can try and\npick some more subtle colors, but\n\n180\n00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.680\nthere's another tool that I think is going\nto really come into play with this and\n\n181\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.200\nthat's our recolor artwork.\n\n182\n00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.930\nNow, I'm using recolor artwork as\nan example here for our mesh tool.\n\n183\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.230\nIt is not something that is\nlimited to just our mesh tool.\n\n184\n00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.400\nYou can do it with this object,\nyou can do it with multiple objects.\n\n185\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.180\nYou don't have to specifically\ndo like I am, but\n\n186\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.590\nI just kind of like to work\nwith it with my mesh tool.\n\n187\n00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.230\nMy re-color artwork is actually something\nthat's available in my control panel.\n\n188\n00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.810\nSo you'll see right now I\nhave my mesh tool selected.\n\n189\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.890\nIf you have nothing selected,\nyou're probably not seeing it.\n\n190\n00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.700\nI'm sorry, my mesh,\nnot my mesh tool, but my mesh.\n\n191\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.760\nThe object, if you will, so\nI have my circle selected.\n\n192\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.110\nAnd then when you see, when you go ahead\nand select that you will see an option for\n\n193\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.410\nwhere we call our work come up.\n\n194\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.242\nNow again, I can have something\nelse selected in this object and\n\n195\n00:09:05.242 --> 00:09:06.453\nthis will still come back.\n\n196\n00:09:06.453 --> 00:09:07.306\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're just in\nthe black arrow tool.\n\n197\n00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:12.174\nYou're on your selection tool and\nso that is like the other examples,\n\n198\n00:09:12.174 --> 00:09:18.190\nif I have 15 squares of different colors\nor any objects with different colors.\n\n199\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.240\nIt's gonna pick all that, so\nthat button on the control panel\n\n200\n00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.020\nwill show up with the black arrow tool,\nand your selected items?\n\n201\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.081\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah,\nanything that you have selected.\n\n202\n00:09:29.081 --> 00:09:31.150\nSo what are we gonna do,\nI'm gonna go ahead and open that up.\n\n203\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.152\nJust click on re-color our work.\n\n204\n00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:38.796\nOkay, you have assign option, assign is\nkinda cool, you can kinda go through here,\n\n205\n00:09:38.796 --> 00:09:42.551\nand you can kinda look at various shades,\nand tints, and whatever.\n\n206\n00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:48.450\nI'm gonna jump past that and I'm gonna\ngo into edit, I love the edit option.\n\n207\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.970\nSo what we could do here,\nwe can take something like this, and\n\n208\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.670\nI'm even gonna try and\nmove this off to the side as best I can.\n\n209\n00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.247\nMaybe I see if I can make\nit a little smaller, nope,\n\n210\n00:09:58.247 --> 00:09:59.645\ndoesn't wanna agree with me here.\n\n211\n00:09:59.645 --> 00:10:02.285\nBut you can watch how it's\ngonna affect my shape.\n\n212\n00:10:02.285 --> 00:10:03.807\nI'm sorry I need to move this over.\n\n213\n00:10:03.807 --> 00:10:07.058\nI need to see it okay, there we go.\n\n214\n00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:09.925\nSo I'm gonna go jump\nback into that edit menu,\n\n215\n00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:13.400\nand then now okay I can take\nthis I think I deselected it.\n\n216\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.300\nNo there we go.\n\n217\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.297\nOkay now I can take this.\n\n218\n00:10:15.297 --> 00:10:16.067\n&gt;&gt; I was like she'll pick it up.\n\n219\n00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:16.632\nShe'll get it.\n\n220\n00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:18.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] She'll see it, yeah.\n\n221\n00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.408\nCome on.\n\n222\n00:10:19.408 --> 00:10:20.546\nYou can do it Emily.\n\n223\n00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:22.452\nSo here's what we've got now.\n\n224\n00:10:22.452 --> 00:10:24.360\nI've got all these wonky colors.\n\n225\n00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.150\nI want to make it look\na little bit more natural.\n\n226\n00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.100\nSo what I can do I can just\ndrag to reassign these colors.\n\n227\n00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.980\nSo that blue, or that yellow.\n\n228\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.270\nI can kinda drag into the blue.\n\n229\n00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.350\nAnd this I can kinda drag over here.\n\n230\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.940\nAnd so I just personally find this\nto be easier that using my swatches,\n\n231\n00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.300\nbecause those are so specified.\n\n232\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.790\nAnd unless you go through and you actually\ntake the time before you use the mesh to\n\n233\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.530\ncreate a specific set of swatches that\nare all gonna blend together well and\n\n234\n00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.590\nyou know those are the ones\nthat you want to use.\n\n235\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.790\nI just think this is an easier way to kind\nof give it that natural shading appearance\n\n236\n00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.900\nthat Vonn was saying.\n\n237\n00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.243\nSo I can kind of just edit this until\nI'm like, okay you know this is starting\n\n238\n00:11:08.243 --> 00:11:14.021\nto look something more like I don't know\n[LAUGH] something more like that, right?\n\n239\n00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:17.810\n[LAUGH] So it just feels a little bit more\nlike these were intended to go together.\n\n240\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.117\nNow you know you don't need to do\nsomething that looks that subtle.\n\n241\n00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:24.013\nThat's pretty subtle there especially the\nway that it is coming I think on camera.\n\n242\n00:11:24.013 --> 00:11:28.740\nIt's a little more apparent I think\non my screen but What you can see\n\n243\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.530\nis how you could use that to be like okay,\nwe'll I'm gonna just do this over here.\n\n244\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.790\nKind of get some of that shading.\n\n245\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.010\nSo it looks a little bit less that\nthat original rainbow I made.\n\n246\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.230\nWhich of course had to do with\nthe specific colors that I chose,\n\n247\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.370\nunderstandably.\n\n248\n00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:49.520\nBut I can just drag and rearrange this,\nand it's just an option that I love.\n\n249\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do too.\n\n250\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.790\nThis recolor can do so many great things.\n\n251\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.340\nCuz a lot of times you\nmight have some things,\n\n252\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.670\nI'm like,\nI don't know if this looks right.\n\n253\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.250\nYou come into here and just start\nkinda dragging all over the place, and\n\n254\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.990\nit can totally change your\noutlook if you want to say it on\n\n255\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.590\nwhat you're looking at by\njust changing a few colors.\n\n256\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:14.959\nLike, yeah changing that green to blue\ngives it a completely different feel for\n\n257\n00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:18.945\nthe entire artwork of\nwhatever you have selected.\n\n258\n00:12:18.945 --> 00:12:23.642\nAnd I just love the kind of, like you're\nsaying the swatches they're great, but\n\n259\n00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:28.222\nyou would have to have like Hundreds of\nswatches to try to kinda pick and choose.\n\n260\n00:12:28.222 --> 00:12:31.474\nThis is very intuitive,\nIn just dragging the handles around, and\n\n261\n00:12:31.474 --> 00:12:34.566\njust seeing what you get, and\nbe like, that looks beautiful.\n\n262\n00:12:34.566 --> 00:12:35.681\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n263\n00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:37.139\nthat looks a lot better\nthan what I had before.\n\n264\n00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:41.459\n[LAUGH] So yeah, this is definitely\nsomething that I like to use,\n\n265\n00:12:41.459 --> 00:12:43.140\nand you can kinda use it.\n\n266\n00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.706\nAnd this is gonna segme, segme.\n\n267\n00:12:44.706 --> 00:12:47.218\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, all the colors, on the stocks\non the gradient is a ramp to me,\n\n307\n00:14:43.702 --> 00:14:47.430\nI can't remember what we really,\nslider is what they called it.\n\n308\n00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Something like that, but yes,\n\n309\n00:14:49.161 --> 00:14:53.429\nwhat you just said I'd like it doesn't\nnecessary tie directly in with the mesh,\n\n310\n00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:53.945\nitself.\n\n311\n00:14:53.945 --> 00:14:56.729\nAll of those thing that we\ndid in the swatches episode,\n\n312\n00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.404\nwhere we went into the libraries,\nor the gradient.\n\n313\n00:14:59.404 --> 00:14:59.983\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n314\n00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.173\n&gt;&gt; It was the gradient episode,\nwhere we went in and said,\n\n315\n00:15:02.173 --> 00:15:05.264\nlook at all these different libraries,\nand the foliage, and the skin tones.\n\n316\n00:15:05.264 --> 00:15:07.862\nThose are ones that are predefined for\nus here.\n\n317\n00:15:07.862 --> 00:15:11.170\nYou go ahead and\napply it somewhere, and then,\n\n318\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.966\nuse that same option of clicking\nthe folder icon in the swatches, and\n\n319\n00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:21.610\nit will make the solid colors of the stuff\nthat they used along that gradient rim.\n\n320\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.824\nAnd then, you can go ahead and have\nthose to match up with different things.\n\n321\n00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:29.363\nI love this feature,\nespecially with the pre-made ones or\n\n322\n00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:32.748\ngetting artwork from somebody\nelse It has gradients.\n\n323\n00:15:32.748 --> 00:15:36.241\nI love all these colors and we pull them\nout, just click the folder icon, and\n\n324\n00:15:36.241 --> 00:15:37.778\nthere you got them, wonderful.\n\n325\n00:15:37.778 --> 00:15:38.911\n&gt;&gt;

We just opened Pandora's box for you.\n\n337\n00:16:08.851 --> 00:16:13.184\nLook at all these things you can do\nwith re-coloring and the mesh and\n\n338\n00:16:13.184 --> 00:16:15.195\nmake marbles and everything.\n\n339\n00:16:15.195 --> 00:16:17.611\n&gt;&gt;

That's why I'm here,\n\n9\n00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.615\njust to tell you the title of the episode.\n\n10\n00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:36.890\nSo today we are talking\nabout advanced swatches.\n\n11\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.161\nWhich I feel like it's kind of like\na broad name that can encompass many\n\n12\n00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:41.110\ndifferent things.\n\n13\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.425\nBut in a lot of ways, what we're talking\nabout has to do with, or at least what\n\n14\n00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.980\nwe're going to start with, I should say,\nhas to do with commercial printing.\n\n15\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.623\nAnd how you wanna kind of frame your\nswatches for commercial printing and\n\n16\n00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:53.540\nkind of set them up.\n\n17\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.310\nAnd a couple of different\nthings that you wanna look at.\n\n18\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.070\nNow, we'll mention some other cool things\nat the end like the logo swatches.\n\n19\n00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.794\nWe'll certainly be getting into\nour swatch libraries again, and\n\n20\n00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:06.061\nwe may even get a little crazy and\nget into the color panel.\n\n21\n00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:07.996\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n22\n00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:11.940\nNow, funny thing about this is, I'm gonna\nstart with a little lesson here, and\n\n23\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.380\nI'm actually gonna be using my type tool.\n\n24\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.930\nYou don't have to follow along, but\nwhat I wanna do here is just to,\n\n25\n00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.660\nI'm a visual person, so\nI just wanna write this out for you.\n\n26\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.060\nSo when we are working with our swatches,\nparticularly in commercial printing,\n\n27\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.000\nyou have two different types of\nswatches that you're wanna work with,\n\n28\n00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.970\neither process or spot.\n\n29\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.550\nSo process colors are really\nthe colors that we've\n\n30\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.270\nbeen working with up until this point.\n\n31\n00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.184\nSo it´s those CMYK colors, again,\nI´m referring to commercial printing,\n\n32\n00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.880\nso I´m just sticking with CMYK.\n\n33\n00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.769\nSo process, we´re gonna say, equals CMYK.\n\n34\n00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:50.110\nNow, why is process CMYK?\n\n35\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.100\nCMYK, cyan, magenta, yellow, and\nblack are those four different\n\n36\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.800\ninks that a printer is using when\nit actually prints something.\n\n37\n00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.030\nSo if you have something\nset up in a CMYK mode and\n\n38\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.150\nyou send it to a commercial printer,\nthe printer is actually printing\n\n39\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.610\npercentages of cyan,\nmagenta, yellow, and black.\n\n40\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.760\nYou guys can remember that from when we\ncreated swatches, and you had the sliders.\n\n41\n00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.129\nRemember, you had that cyan slider,\nmagenta, yellow and black, and\n\n42\n00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.277\nyou had kind of combinations\nof all of those.\n\n43\n00:02:18.277 --> 00:02:22.079\nSo that CMYK,\nthat equals four inks, right?\n\n44\n00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.610\nSpot color, spot colors are also\nkind of known as Pantone colors.\n\n45\n00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.660\nHave you ever heard the term\nPantone thrown around?\n\n46\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.200\nPantone is kind of just the color\nauthority, at least where we are.\n\n47\n00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.490\nThey do all kinds of crazy things\nwhere they kind of establish\n\n48\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.513\na color of the year.\n\n49\n00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:42.643\nAnd they're tied into fashion and\nall of these other different industries,\n\n50\n00:02:42.643 --> 00:02:46.021\nwhere they kind of set the standard for\ncolor in this industry.\n\n51\n00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.437\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if we even meant to do\nthis on purpose, but didn't Target have\n\n52\n00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:53.034\nsomething a couple of years ago, where\nthey had like the Pantone Collection?\n\n53\n00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:53.615\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n54\n00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:57.760\n&gt;&gt; And everything was like Pantone 185 or\nwhatever, right?\n\n55\n00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mugs and things like that, where\nthey would have the top of it be white and\n\n56\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.570\nthen the bottom half is Pantone this.\n\n57\n00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.150\nSo it's fairly common,\nyou may not have heard of it.\n\n58\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.017\nIt's quite possible that you wouldn't have\nheard of it, but it's also pretty common.\n\n59\n00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:17.364\n&gt;&gt; And it's things like,\nI've noticed it because I'm like, my gosh,\n\n60\n00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.410\nthey're doing a whole thing\non Pantones at Target.\n\n61\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.146\nWhere it's like, you had the purples,\nand I had all the spreads,\n\n62\n00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:26.766\nthe what are those things\nthat goes on the bed?\n\n63\n00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:27.397\n&gt;&gt; A bedspread?\n\n64\n00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:27.954\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n65\n00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:30.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You had spread,\n\n66\n00:03:30.114 --> 00:03:33.380\nI was like [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n67\n00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.251\n&gt;&gt; Wow, yes, that's why you're here,\n\n68\n00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:37.906\nto help me think, so.\n\n69\n00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:39.685\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's it, yeah.\n\n70\n00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:43.645\nBut yeah, you're right, so you probably,\nwe noticed it cuz we're aware.\n\n71\n00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:46.841\nAnd depending on how aware you are before,\nyou might not have noticed it.\n\n72\n00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:50.190\nSo that spot, that equals a Pantone color.\n\n73\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.210\nNow, what's kind of the difference\nhere mainly between a process versus\n\n74\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.510\na spot color?\n\n75\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.510\nA process color is four inks,\na spot color is one ink.\n\n76\n00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.950\nSo when you send something to the printer,\nthey only have to print one specific ink.\n\n77\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.735\nNow, how's it work?\n\n78\n00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:08.409\nIt's typically, and\nVonne knows all about this, so\n\n79\n00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.320\nshe can correct me if I'm wrong here.\n\n80\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.550\nBut it's an ink that's gonna be\nmixed outside of the printer, and\n\n81\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.580\nthen it's actually something that you're\ngonna go ahead and insert in there.\n\n82\n00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.610\nSo it's not something like our CMYK,\nwhere it's as it's happening,\n\n83\n00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.230\nthose four inks are combining.\n\n84\n00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.530\nIt's something mixed outside the printer.\n\n85\n00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we were talking\nabout commercial print,\n\n86\n00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.040\nnormally what are known as offset\nprinting, not digital printing.\n\n87\n00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.060\nCuz digital printing goes back to just\nyour regular desktop printer, where you\n\n88\n00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.550\nhave the cartridges, and it just goes\nahead and spits out the paper at the end.\n\n89\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.100\nDigital printing, and that says just be\na really, really big version of that.\n\n90\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.630\nWhen you have offset printing,\nyou have a commercial press.\n\n91\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.750\nAnd the press have what are known as\nplates, and the plates is where it takes\n\n92\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.070\nand breaks up your artwork, or whatever\nyou have, into those individual inks.\n\n93\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.940\nThe cyan, magenta, yellow and\nblack, and they go ahead and\n\n94\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.668\nput the ink on the well on the top.\n\n95\n00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:02.700\nAnd then it rolls up, kind of like\na stamp, rolls up into the ink, and\n\n96\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.230\nthen rolls down into your paper.\n\n97\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.370\nAnd that's where those inks process\ntogether on the paper to go ahead and\n\n98\n00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.350\nmake your greens and your oranges and\nyour purples and things like that.\n\n99\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.980\nSo if you have something that I need\nto have a two color process, or\n\n100\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.490\ntwo color artwork, or\neven one color artwork,\n\n101\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.500\nthen that means it's only\none plate on that press.\n\n102\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.590\nAnd then all of the ink is that one color,\ngoes down onto the paper, and\n\n103\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.620\nthen that's only one plate.\n\n104\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.600\nLike I just said, biggest difference here,\nsometimes with cost.\n\n105\n00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.940\nThink about four inks, more money.\n\n106\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.630\nOne ink or two inks, less money in theory,\nwhen you get into those types of things.\n\n107\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that was actually\ngonna be my next point to you.\n\n108\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.490\nIs I think that they're cheaper.\n\n109\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.241\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Certainly I never\nwant to be the one to tell somebody,\n\n110\n00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:54.144\nyes absolutely, that's certainly something\nyou wanna talk to your printer about, but\n\n111\n00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:55.499\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and again,\n\n112\n00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.329\nthrowing out that whole digital versus\noffset printing, depending on your job and\n\n113\n00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:01.845\nhow much you're going to be doing,\nand everything.\n\n114\n00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:05.580\nQuantity-wise and depending on your job,\nit's like well we'll just go ahead and\n\n115\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.950\nrun that digitally rather\nthan on the press.\n\n116\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.580\nBecause we'll actually save you money\non the digital versus the offset and\n\n117\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.920\nthen like the amount of\ninks doesn't really matter.\n\n118\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.241\nBut I'm getting into the weeds,\ncuz I do love to talk about this stuff.\n\n119\n00:06:19.241 --> 00:06:21.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And\nI can talk about it for hours.\n\n120\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.220\nSo we're gonna just kinda go ahead and\nconsult your print company,\n\n121\n00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.030\nyour commercial printer.\n\n122\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.974\nTalk to them, honestly sometimes\nbefore you even start a job.\n\n123\n00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:31.950\nTo kinda get your mind around,\n\n124\n00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.225\nwhat do I need to even think\nabout in terms of money?\n\n125\n00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:39.200\nCuz you don't wanna design this amazing\nartwork with four process colors,\n\n126\n00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.480\nthree spots, because that's what\nyou had to have, that's seven.\n\n127\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.793\nThat's gonna be a lot of money, so.\n\n128\n00:06:43.793 --> 00:06:46.056\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, and then you client or\n\n129\n00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:49.512\nwhoever loves it, and then you have to be\nthe one to back to them going well, sorry.\n\n130\n00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:50.054\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n131\n00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:51.201\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So always,\n\n132\n00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.633\nalways my advice is talk to your printer\nif it is something that you're gonna be\n\n133\n00:06:54.633 --> 00:06:55.570\nworking on in print.\n\n134\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.170\nNow, how do I actually like\nfind these Pantone colors?\n\n135\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.860\nI mentioned it's something\nthat's kind of premixed outside.\n\n136\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.845\nSo in other words,\n\n137\n00:07:03.845 --> 00:07:07.330\nthey're actually something that\nare already created basically for you.\n\n138\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.825\nSo what we're going to be working\nwith here are really just a set\n\n139\n00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:14.935\nof Pantone swatches, I mentioned\nPantone's kind of the color authority.\n\n140\n00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:15.765\nAnd even say,\n\n141\n00:07:15.765 --> 00:07:20.385\nI would go online, go to their website,\nthey have color books available for you.\n\n142\n00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:22.285\nIt's almost like going to Lowe's or\nHome Depot, and\n\n143\n00:07:22.285 --> 00:07:23.885\nyou pull out the paint swatches.\n\n144\n00:07:23.885 --> 00:07:29.555\nThat's what Pantone has for colors\nthat we can use in terms of designing.\n\n145\n00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:31.865\nSo I'm gonna go into my Swatches panel.\n\n146\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.139\nAnd then what we're gonna do, we're\ngonna go into our color libraries, so\n\n147\n00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:38.576\nthe Swatch Libraries menu.\n\n148\n00:07:38.576 --> 00:07:42.500\nAnd then you can go down\ninto your Color Books.\n\n149\n00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.479\nNow we have several different options\nhere, and we're gonna skip and\n\n150\n00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:48.238\nfocus mainly on the CMYK ones.\n\n151\n00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:51.407\nBut you'll notice that there\nare all kinds of different things,\n\n152\n00:07:51.407 --> 00:07:54.413\nyou can choose from metallics,\npastels, things like that.\n\n153\n00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:59.285\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that also kinda throws\na whole other element of what The ink\n\n154\n00:07:59.285 --> 00:08:02.738\nthat is being mixed and\nlike what basis they use.\n\n155\n00:08:02.738 --> 00:08:05.074\nWhether it has a metallic, or that neon.\n\n156\n00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:08.230\nAnd also, you can see down there like,\ncoded versus uncoded.\n\n157\n00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.915\nThat's talking about like the paper stock.\n\n158\n00:08:09.915 --> 00:08:10.484\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n159\n00:08:10.484 --> 00:08:14.111\nLike what you're actually printing on,\nbecause that kind affect how\n\n160\n00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:18.270\nthe ink is going to actually kind of\nblend into the paper, if you wanna say.\n\n161\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.736\nAnd it's nice that you call them books,\nbecause if you were doing that drop down\n\n162\n00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:24.644\nand looking for Pantone,\nin this main menu, if you wanna call it.\n\n163\n00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:29.172\nYou're like, Pantone doesn't exist, no,\nit's off the color books, which is weird.\n\n164\n00:08:29.172 --> 00:08:31.450\nJust throwing out a couple more things.\n\n165\n00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.820\nPantone is the one that everybody\nnormally goes with, but\n\n166\n00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.710\nyou can see there's that HKS and\nsome other ones in there.\n\n167\n00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.660\nThey are not the only ones out there but,\nPantones were, like the Toyo Ink and\n\n168\n00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.860\neverything.\n\n169\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.920\nBut again, I think its pretty safe to say\nthat Pantone is gonna be the one that's\n\n170\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.600\ngonna win out in the long run.\n\n171\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nits typically the one that I would choose,\n\n172\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.700\nnow to her point you know you\ncan't pick these other options.\n\n173\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.730\nBut, as you've probably heard me\ncalling on the color authority,\n\n174\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.790\nyou can see which way I kinda lean\nin that, so what we're gonna do,\n\n175\n00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.010\nI typically would go with\na Pantone solid coated.\n\n176\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.846\nNow you're free, of course,\nto pick out the Pantone pastels and\n\n177\n00:09:09.846 --> 00:09:12.582\nneons just to see what\nsome of those look like.\n\n178\n00:09:12.582 --> 00:09:16.388\nBut just kinda from a basic standpoint,\nI always go to color books and\n\n179\n00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:21.002\nthen go to Pantone solid coated, because\nthat's gonna be kind of what I would use.\n\n180\n00:09:21.002 --> 00:09:24.310\nWe're thinking about, again,\nthat coated versus un-coated.\n\n181\n00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.420\nHas to do with the actual paper stock,\nbut if I'm printing something for\n\n182\n00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.200\nclient, it's probably gonna be in\na little bit nicer of a stock.\n\n183\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.840\nThat uncoated is more just like printer\npaper, is kinda the way I look at it.\n\n184\n00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.438\nSo, Pantone Solid Coated,\nI'm gonna go ahead and grab that.\n\n185\n00:09:36.438 --> 00:09:40.590\nNow you see you'll have all of these\ndifferent colors to choose from.\n\n186\n00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.130\nAll of these different options.\n\n187\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.820\nNow, something else that you will probably\nnotice with all of these different\n\n188\n00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.720\noptions, they all have a little\neyeball attached to them, right.\n\n189\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.060\nSo, what we are seeing with\nall of these spot colors, and\n\n190\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.885\nyou can even see as I\nstart to click around.\n\n191\n00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:55.760\nEverytime I click on one,\nit adds to my swatches panel,\n\n192\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.540\nyou see that happening, right there?\n\n193\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.430\nIn my swatches panel, you can see\nthe distinction between a process versus\n\n194\n00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.940\na spot color based on that little dot.\n\n195\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.690\nSo It'll have that white corner,\nand then, you have a dot on it and\n\n196\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.140\nyou can think process spot,\nthe spot colors have a spot there.\n\n197\n00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.660\nAnd what you can do, you can kind of just\nfilter through and see what works for you.\n\n198\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.493\nNow, this is where having a color\nbook will come in handy, so\n\n199\n00:10:17.493 --> 00:10:19.895\nif you were actually to\npurchase one from Pantone.\n\n200\n00:10:19.895 --> 00:10:24.787\nI say purchase, they're not necessarily\nalways the most inexpensive things\n\n201\n00:10:24.787 --> 00:10:29.247\nthat you can buy, but they do have\nsome higher and lower-end options.\n\n202\n00:10:29.247 --> 00:10:31.287\nYou can kind of look through and\n\n203\n00:10:31.287 --> 00:10:35.850\nyou can see exactly what it's going\nto look like when it's printed.\n\n204\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.970\nSo in my case solid coated,\nthey would have this particular, what am I\n\n205\n00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:44.560\nhovering over, Pantone 587c, they would\nhave it printed on a coded stock, so\n\n206\n00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.550\nI can see exactly what\nthat's going to look like.\n\n207\n00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.796\nAnd, that's really one of the benefits\nof Pantone or a spot color, in general.\n\n208\n00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:52.540\nIs that, you have more of a clear idea\nof what it is going to look like.\n\n209\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.014\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of your major corporations\nand major companies that have\n\n210\n00:10:57.014 --> 00:11:01.830\nbeen branded, they'll have guides\nthat say, what is my CMYK value?\n\n211\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.180\nWhat is my spot value?\n\n212\n00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.667\nWhat is my RGB value?\nThey have all of them,\n\n213\n00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:09.178\nkind of designated because, if you're\nsupposed to use the company colors and\n\n214\n00:11:09.178 --> 00:11:10.860\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n215\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.020\nGoing back to, if we're only going to\ndo University of Florida, for example.\n\n216\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.570\nThey have orange and blue.\n\n217\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.205\nWell, that orange is 172C.\n\n218\n00:11:20.205 --> 00:11:21.700\nWhy?\n\n219\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.389\nBecause we've done a lot of work for\nUF and we know that [LAUGH].\n\n220\n00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:28.830\nSo that is Gator orange\nin the Pantone value.\n\n221\n00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.732\nAnd if I was gonna look up,\nyep, Gator blue, 287.\n\n222\n00:11:32.732 --> 00:11:33.259\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n223\n00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:37.600\nThere's my Gator blue, and that's going\nto designate that in that Pantone.\n\n224\n00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.300\nIf you're thinking about if we were making\na flyer, or any type of little thing that\n\n225\n00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.720\nonly needed Get a orange and get a blue,\nI would designate that as a spot,\n\n226\n00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.720\nbecause that's two inks plus money,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n227\n00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.497\nAnd there's even some things that like you\ncan only achieve a certain color with that\n\n228\n00:11:53.497 --> 00:11:57.130\nPantone like there's no\nactually like relate to that,\n\n229\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.030\nthat's going a little extreme.\n\n230\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n231\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.822\nProbably wouldn't want a company branded\nlike that, where you only had spot inks,\n\n232\n00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:06.213\nbecause that could get\na little too expensive.\n\n233\n00:12:06.213 --> 00:12:07.816\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a little limiting.\n\n234\n00:12:07.816 --> 00:12:08.354\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n235\n00:12:08.354 --> 00:12:08.906\n&gt;&gt; So, question for you.\n\n236\n00:12:08.906 --> 00:12:12.620\nSo now, when we say this, we're saying\nokay two inks and things like that.\n\n237\n00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.949\nBut that's not including black and\nwhite and shades of grey.\n\n238\n00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:15.609\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n239\n00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:16.650\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n240\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n241\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n242\n00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.570\nThat would be an ink in itself,\nso if you had black, orange and\n\n243\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.270\nblue that's three inks and everything and\nwe're getting more into like varying\n\n244\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.261\nprint specific stuff because\nwe do a lot of print work.\n\n245\n00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:29.885\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n246\n00:12:29.885 --> 00:12:33.070\n&gt;&gt; But it is nice to know that\nthat's what it's going to do, and\n\n247\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.250\njust really knowing the nature of.\n\n248\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.010\nHey, you have to at the artwork level,\n\n249\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:43.550\nyou have to designate what the color\ninformation is going to be.\n\n250\n00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.980\nIs it a process blue,\nor is it a spot blue?\n\n251\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.620\nBecause, how you design it here,\nmakes a huge difference,\n\n252\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.580\nor it really is everything of how the\nprinter is going to get your files, and\n\n253\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.950\nbe able to translate what that\ninformation's going to be in.\n\n254\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo, but what you see as you're working,\n\n255\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.970\nbesides from noticing those spots in my\nswatches panel, I'm not really gonna see\n\n256\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.030\na whole lot of difference when I'm\nactually working on something.\n\n257\n00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.480\nSo I can go ahead here, and\n\n258\n00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.370\nI can just apply this just in the same\nway that I would a typical swatch.\n\n259\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.260\nNow, what tends to kind\nof confuse people here.\n\n260\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.240\nOkay, we have that option with\nthe little slash and the dot through it.\n\n261\n00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.600\nThere's another option we can\ncreate in our swatches panel,\n\n262\n00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.930\nthat's gonna have kind\nof a similar look to it.\n\n263\n00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.270\nThat might kinda throw you off,\nand that's called a global swatch.\n\n264\n00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.873\nSo what I'm gonna do here, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and create a couple pieces.\n\n265\n00:13:33.873 --> 00:13:36.220\nWell, actually no, I take that back.\n\n266\n00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.270\nI'm just gonna stick with this,\nas I'm thinking it through.\n\n267\n00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.610\nAnd then,\nI'm gonna create a new swatch here.\n\n268\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.110\nSo I'm gonna create a new swatch, and you\ncan go ahead and you can change the color.\n\n269\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.020\nWe talked about those sliders,\nthose CMYK sliders.\n\n270\n00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.290\nAnother option, actually,\nas I'm pointing this out.\n\n271\n00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.570\nI could go to my color panel,\nuse the sliders there, and\n\n272\n00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.930\nkinda just do the same thing\nuntil I find something.\n\n273\n00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.300\nYay, yeah I kinda like that purply gray.\n\n274\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.650\nAnd then go into my swatches panel, I'm\ngonna X out of those Pantones real quick.\n\n275\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.040\nCreate a new swatch, and\nnow here's the thing I wanna point out.\n\n276\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.300\nSo I have this color I like,\nbut, you know,\n\n277\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.100\nit's variety of different reasons\nwhy you might wanna do this.\n\n278\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.970\nBut, say that I like it but\nI'm not positive about it, okay.\n\n279\n00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.880\nI'm thinking, it's good but\nI may wanna change it later.\n\n280\n00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.290\nSo what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go\nahead and apply a global swatch.\n\n281\n00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.900\nNow again, different reasons why you might\nwant to do this, but the example I'm going\n\n282\n00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.640\nwith is that, I'm just a little\nunsure about this purpley color.\n\n283\n00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.260\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and hit OK.\n\n284\n00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.390\nI'm gonna create a global swatch.\n\n285\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.270\nNow, why did I say that was confusing?\n\n286\n00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.860\nBecause if you look at this,\nyou see how those spot colors,\n\n287\n00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.600\nthey have a spot on there?\n\n288\n00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.830\nMy global swatch has\na very similar look to it.\n\n289\n00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.580\nIt has that kind of white\nflag in the corner.\n\n290\n00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.940\nBut, it's not a spot color,\nthis is a processed color.\n\n291\n00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.400\nCan you see I just mixed\nit with my CMYK values?\n\n292\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.810\nYou know, I went ahead and\nmixed in my color panel.\n\n293\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:58.428\nIt is not a Pantone.\nAnd\n\n294\n00:14:58.428 --> 00:15:02.320\nthis is generally something that\nthrew me off for the longest time.\n\n295\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.871\nI would look at something with that\nlittle white flag and I'll be like, yeah,\n\n296\n00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:05.770\nthat's a Pantone color.\n\n297\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:06.400\nYou know, I don't know.\n\n298\n00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.447\nBecause you just forget.\nIt makes perfect sense right now,\n\n299\n00:15:09.447 --> 00:15:10.211\nspot is the spot.\n\n300\n00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:14.460\nBut six months down the road\nyou might not remember.\n\n301\n00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.030\nSo, there is a key difference\nthere between that spot and\n\n302\n00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.090\nthen just the white flag.\n\n303\n00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.750\nNow, what is the global swatch do for us?\n\n304\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:27.639\nWell say that I go here, and\nI'm gonna just start creating\n\n305\n00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:33.539\na bunch of things with that\nspecific global swatch apply.\n\n306\n00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:35.673\nSo, I got a couple of\ndifferent things going on.\n\n307\n00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:39.240\nNow, I've said it before I wasn't\nreally quite sure about this purple\n\n308\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.910\nthat I had going on,\nI thought maybe I'd wanna change it later.\n\n309\n00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:47.199\nLet me go back into my swatches panel and\nI'm going to double click on this.\n\n310\n00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:50.139\nAnd I am going to adjust my color, so\n\n311\n00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:53.578\nmaybe I decide I want\nthat to be more blue.\n\n312\n00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.381\nGo ahead, and hit OK.\n\n313\n00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:59.861\nEverything that was using that\nglobal swatch will then change.\n\n314\n00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:05.002\nSo super handy, again, I almost say, like,\na lot of time I just create my swatches\n\n315\n00:16:05.002 --> 00:16:10.020\nglobally as I'm working, you know, just so\nthat I can more easily change them.\n\n316\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.520\n&gt;&gt; I've gotten in the habit of,\n\n317\n00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.160\nanytime I'm mixing colors,\nI always change it to a global swatch.\n\n318\n00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.320\nJust for that idea, I might want to go and\nchange that one thing later.\n\n319\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.560\nNow we did talk about read color artwork,\nin another episode,\n\n320\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.900\nso you can think, well I'll just\ngo ahead and do the recolor.\n\n321\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.790\nIt's just another way to\nget to the same place.\n\n322\n00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:35.650\nAnd that kind of link, the linking of the\ncolor apply to your object, to the swatch.\n\n323\n00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.480\nThe only way you can get\nthat is with global.\n\n324\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.720\nCuz you could go to any one of\nthese swatches that are not global.\n\n325\n00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.440\nLike the regular CMYK process or\nan RGB, double-click it, go into and\n\n326\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:52.440\nstart changing its values, but if you had\nalready applied that multiple places and\n\n327\n00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.510\nthen you go and change the base,\nif you want to say.\n\n328\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.890\nIt´s not connected,\nthere´s no connection back to it.\n\n329\n00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:03.280\nIt has to be global for\nit to do what we just demonstrated,\n\n330\n00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.230\ntying it all together So that's why\nI've just got in the habit of click that\n\n331\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:13.080\nbox at the bottom, make it a global swatch\njust in case later I need to modify it.\n\n332\n00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n333\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.470\nI'm kinda glad you brought it\nback to the recolor artwork, too.\n\n334\n00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.540\nCuz it is kind of just a different\n\n335\n00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.310\na different way of getting\nto the same thing.\n\n336\n00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.080\nNow, there's one other thing that I want\nto mention with our global swatches.\n\n337\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.160\nJust because I know it tends to come\nup in some of the things that I do.\n\n338\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.920\nI'm going to hop back into the color\npanel, I'm still using this global swatch.\n\n339\n00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.700\nThis may be getting to\ninto the weeds here, but\n\n340\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.590\nI'm going to bring up a concept\ncalled tint Swatches.\n\n341\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:39.130\nSo, in color you have things\ncalled shades and tints.\n\n342\n00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.420\nYou've probably heard of\na shade of a certain color.\n\n343\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.480\nTechnically speaking, again I don't want\nto get too much into the weeds here.\n\n344\n00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.970\nTechnically speaking, a shade is\nwhen you add black to a color and\n\n345\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.770\na tint is when you add white to a color.\n\n346\n00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.598\nWhen you have a global swatch\nin illustrator you can actually,\n\n347\n00:17:56.598 --> 00:17:58.704\nvery easily create a tint.\n\n",

--> 00:00:15.382\nwelcome back to another exciting\naddition of CreativeProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:20.820\nI'm your host Vonne Smith, and we're\ncontinuing on with Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n6\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.832\nAnd we're gonna be talking\nall about patterns.\n\n7\n00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:25.421\nYes, I had to sing it.\n\n8\n00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.467\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And here to help us is Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:29.538\nEmily Ramsey.\n\n10\n00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:30.305\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n11\n00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:32.620\nI feel like patterns are one of\nthose that you have to sing.\n\n12\n00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.757\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Every once in a while,\n\n13\n00:00:33.757 --> 00:00:35.423\nyou come across something in Illustrator.\n\n14\n00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:38.213\nYou're like,\nI'm just that excited about it, right?\n\n15\n00:00:38.213 --> 00:00:42.366\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we haven't been excited\nabout anything in this whole show.\n\n16\n00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.418\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, no,\nIllustrator is so boring.\n\n17\n00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:45.351\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:46.488\n&gt;&gt; No, so I'm excited.\n\n19\n00:00:46.488 --> 00:00:50.445\nWe're gonna actually get in to\nmaking some patterns in Illustrator.\n\n20\n00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:54.602\nSo you may have looked at or we may have\nmentioned before some patterns swatches\n\n21\n00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:57.520\nthat are already\npreexisting in Illustrator.\n\n22\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.920\nAnd that's great, but won't it be more\nfun if we could kind of create our own?\n\n23\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.210\nSo that's what we're getting into here.\n\n24\n00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.371\nNow what I'm gonna start off with here.\n\n25\n00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.963\nWe're basically gonna go through\ntwo different types of patterns.\n\n26\n00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:13.042\nI'm gonna do one, but\nI like to call my more organic pattern,\n\n27\n00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:15.562\nwhich is just kind of free form shape.\n\n28\n00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:19.610\nAnd then I'm gonna do another one,\nwhere everything is kind of repeated and\n\n29\n00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.760\nperfectly matched.\n\n30\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.349\nSo we're gonna start\nwith our organic pattern,\n\n31\n00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.220\nbecause that's gonna be\na little bit easier.\n\n32\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.435\nAnd so, when I say organic,\nI'm not saying healthy.\n\n33\n00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:34.254\nSo I'm actually going to use\nthe example of creating sprinkles.\n\n34\n00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:36.720\nYou do not have to create sprinkles, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.294\nIf that's not what you're feeling,\nif you're on a diet, make something else.\n\n36\n00:01:40.294 --> 00:01:43.650\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nuse the example of sprinkles here.\n\n37\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.400\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ngrab my rectangle tool.\n\n38\n00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.440\nIn case, you're wondering how\nI'm gonna make a sprinkle.\n\n39\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.350\nI'm basically just gonna make\na couple rounded rectangles with some\n\n40\n00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.505\nfancy colors on them.\n\n41\n00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:55.805\nSo I'm using the word sprinkles loosely.\n\n42\n00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:58.475\nBut what I can do here,\nI'm gonna go in, I'm gonna zoom in.\n\n43\n00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:01.765\nI could have used my Rounded Rectangle\nTool, but what I'm actually gonna do for\n\n44\n00:02:01.765 --> 00:02:06.295\nno real apparent reason is just use\nthese little circles to drag in.\n\n45\n00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:08.235\nYou could have used your\nRounded Rectangle Tool.\n\n46\n00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:09.637\nI just kind of like that better.\n\n47\n00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:12.448\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\njust duplicate this over again.\n\n48\n00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:17.345\nSo rather than having to go through\nthe effort of actually re-drawing\n\n49\n00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:21.750\nthat sprinkle, I'm just gonna alt drag,\nduplicate that up.\n\n50\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.010\nAnd then I'm gonna start kinda\nmoving these little guys around.\n\n51\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.840\nSo maybe I'll have something that looks\nlike that, and drag another one over here.\n\n52\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.508\nI mean, it kind of get them where I\nlike and then we can go through and\n\n53\n00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:34.662\nchange some colors as well.\n\n54\n00:02:34.662 --> 00:02:38.892\nSo don't think that, we're only\ngonna have the yellow sprinkles.\n\n55\n00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:41.730\nIf you haven't been here by now,\nyou probably figured out we are making\n\n56\n00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.496\nrainbows sprinkles, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Rainbows, yay.\n\n57\n00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:48.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yes, we're going\nwith the rainbow sprinkles here.\n\n58\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.759\nI'm just gonna do something like this,\n\n59\n00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.551\nI mean, I'm really not gonna\nworry about perfecting it.\n\n60\n00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:59.090\nI'm just gonna do Some random\nsprinkly things, right?\n\n61\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.750\nSprinkly that's a word.\n\n62\n00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.130\nSo we'll do something that looks like\nthat, that may or may not end up\n\n63\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.680\nlooking so good, but we can always fix\nit later, that's always an option.\n\n64\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.340\nSo I'm gonna just call those sprinkles,\ngo here.\n\n65\n00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.710\nStart adding some color on.\n\n66\n00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.730\nSo add some, I don't know what color that\nwas, that was too close, there we go.\n\n67\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.560\nYou can have purple sprinkles, right?\n\n68\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.912\nPurple sprinkles are a thing?\n\n69\n00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:30.706\nAnd maybe I'll just add one more,\njust cause I-\n\n70\n00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:32.041\n&gt;&gt; You gotta have orange, right?\n\n71\n00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:32.609\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.502\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I'm gonna make the rainbow, okay,\n\n73\n00:03:35.502 --> 00:03:36.660\nI need to have orange.\n\n74\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.990\nSo I'm just gonna do something,\nokay, sort of like that.\n\n75\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.430\nAnd at some point,\nI'm just gonna stop perfecting it,\n\n76\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.810\ncuz we could spend all day with me sitting\nhere really working on my sprinkles.\n\n77\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.960\nBut just for examples sake,\nI'm just gonna kind of leave this b,e\n\n78\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.110\ncuz that will also bring us how to\nfix it later if I don't like this.\n\n79\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.130\nSo what I can do to make pattern?\n\n80\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.159\nAnd it's like the prep work for\nmaking a pattern is so\n\n81\n00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:05.115\nmuch harder than the actual\nconverting it to a pattern process.\n\n82\n00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:06.081\nIt's not even funny.\n\n83\n00:04:06.081 --> 00:04:11.245\nSo you can see here, this is my example\nof an easy pattern because it's organic.\n\n84\n00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.720\nAnd there's no like real matching\nthat we have to work with.\n\n85\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.440\nIt doesn't have to be perfectly\nrepeated at anywhere.\n\n86\n00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.245\nSo this can really be as difficult or\n\n87\n00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:24.181\nas easy as you wanna make it,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n88\n00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:28.484\nSo this kind of part to it, I feel like\nit is the more challenging part with\n\n89\n00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:31.962\na pattern, but\nalso can be as simple as making sprinkles.\n\n90\n00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:36.895\nNow to actually create a pattern swatch,\nwhat we're gonna do, I'm gonna click,\n\n91\n00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:39.584\nhold, and\ndrag this into my swatches panel.\n\n92\n00:04:39.584 --> 00:04:42.339\nSo you see, as I select these shapes and\nclick, hold and\n\n93\n00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.462\ndrag them into my swatches panel,\nI get that little blue line.\n\n94\n00:04:45.462 --> 00:04:49.313\nit kind of letting me know where I am, and\nthen I also get a green circle with a plus\n\n95\n00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:52.720\nsign on it, letting me know I can go\nahead and drop something in there.\n\n96\n00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.662\nSo when I let go, I now can kind\nof see the preview of my swatches.\n\n97\n00:04:56.662 --> 00:04:59.480\nYou can also see some other\nones that I've done before.\n\n98\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.600\nSo we can take these away, we don't even\nneed these anymore, get rid of that.\n\n99\n00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.662\nAnd then now, I'm just gonna go draw\na box and apply that like a swatch,\n\n100\n00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:11.252\njust as I normally would\nwith anything else.\n\n101\n00:05:11.252 --> 00:05:16.536\nAnd now you can see my\nLisa Frank style sprinkles.\n\n102\n00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:20.750\n[LAUGH] Whatever I'm calling this\nsprinkles, my rainbow sprinkles here.\n\n103\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.201\nAnd you can have that as swatch.\n\n104\n00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:27.900\nSo you can see it, something that I feel\nlike you can, again make as difficult or\n\n105\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.090\nas easy as you possibly want.\n\n106\n00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.501\nNow a couple you'll notice with this.\n\n107\n00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:35.241\nWhen I go ahead and resize my shape\nis like, for whatever reason,\n\n108\n00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:38.437\nnaturally speaking you would\nwanna resize something,\n\n109\n00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:42.531\nyou're gonna see it's gonna squish\nall those all of those sprinkles.\n\n110\n00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:46.606\nSo what I need to do to go ahead and kind\nof reset this, is I am just gonna single\n\n111\n00:05:46.606 --> 00:05:51.410\nclick again on that pattern swatch,\nso I'm just gonna single click here.\n\n112\n00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.600\nAnd that will kind of reset it.\n\n113\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.050\nSo as you are drawing and drag and\ndrop, don't feel like you have to\n\n114\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.990\nbe kind of stuck with this really\nstretched out sprinkle here.\n\n115\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.200\nYou can go ahead and\nsingle-click to reset.\n\n116\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.330\n&gt;&gt; And this option of words actually\nscaling or resizing the pattern.\n\n117\n00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.330\nIt is newer, because before,\nme being old, [LAUGH]\n\n118\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.490\nback in the day it almost worked like\na clipping mask to where the shape was,\n\n119\n00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.500\nyou make it smaller but\nthe pattern never moved or changed.\n\n120\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.675\nSo this default setting of the patterns\nhas been kind of moved around,\n\n121\n00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:31.190\nit's slightly newer.\n\n122\n00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.490\nIt's kind of like now\nit's already part of it.\n\n123\n00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.210\nSo that I'm talking a couple of years\nat least it's been part of it, but\n\n124\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.040\nI remember when it would not do that.\n\n125\n00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.961\nSo even now since I, it's been awhile\nsince I've used pattern swatches.\n\n126\n00:06:43.961 --> 00:06:46.788\nI was just like, yeah,\nI forgot it does that.\n\n127\n00:06:46.788 --> 00:06:47.635\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n128\n00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:50.430\nit really is a time saver\nreally that you can do that.\n\n129\n00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.260\nNow I mentioned before,\nlike what if I want to fix this later?\n\n130\n00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.610\nOkay, what if I don't exactly love\nthe way that these are working.\n\n131\n00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.895\nSometimes, these actually worked\nout better than I expected.\n\n132\n00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:05.951\nSometimes you can have like some kind\nof weird gaps and things like that.\n\n133\n00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:08.303\nAnd you may wanna adjust or\nmaybe you just want to adjust the color,\n\n134\n00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:11.060\nlike I don't like that purple or\nsomething like that.\n\n135\n00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.070\nYou can leave this up or not, it doesn't\nmatter, I can go ahead and delete this.\n\n136\n00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.020\nLet's just say, that I again, no longer\nhad and I don't have anything on my art\n\n137\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.220\nboard here that original sprinkle pattern\nthat I made to create the swatch.\n\n138\n00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.860\nSo that doesn't exist anymore.\n\n139\n00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.880\nSo what we're gonna do to\nnow edit the swatch is just\n\n140\n00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.650\nthe same way we got it in there, drag and\ndrop it in, drag and drop it out.\n\n141\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.770\nSo if I drag and\n\n142\n00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.780\ndrop it out to my art board, you'll see\nI kept those original sprinkles to edit.\n\n143\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.350\nNow this is gonna be kind of funny,\n\n144\n00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.990\ncuz it almost acts again,\nkind of like a clipping mask.\n\n145\n00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.051\nI wanna say you can only move it so far.\n\n146\n00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:50.487\nYou kind of need to stay within\nthe confines of that original box,\n\n147\n00:07:50.487 --> 00:07:54.741\ncuz what's gonna happen is things will\nstart to get cut off and things like that.\n\n148\n00:07:54.741 --> 00:08:00.022\nBut if I stay within that,\nI can go here and I can change the color.\n\n149\n00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:03.368\nAgain, I could move some of\nthese around if I wanted to.\n\n150\n00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:05.406\nIf I wanted to kind of do that.\n\n151\n00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:08.928\nIf I just wasn't feeling it, it is\nan option that I have available to me.\n\n152\n00:08:08.928 --> 00:08:11.200\nNow, I feel like I'm, I'm out of colors.\n\n153\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.180\nThe purple was maybe my only option there.\n\n154\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.267\nSo, we'll do a darker blue,\nhow about that?\n\n155\n00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:18.380\nGo ahead and do that.\n\n156\n00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.200\nAnd then now,\nI have two different options.\n\n157\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.040\nI can click, hold and drag again,\nif I want to replace a swatch, or\n\n158\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.010\nI'm sorry or if I want to create\na new swatch or if I go here.\n\n159\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.714\nLet's pretend I have something\nworking with this old one,\n\n160\n00:08:31.714 --> 00:08:34.248\nI can also replace the original swatch.\n\n161\n00:08:34.248 --> 00:08:39.208\nSo if I, for whatever reason I actually\njust wanna get rid of that first one that\n\n162\n00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:43.720\nI created entirely, if I click holding\ndrag while holding down my Alt or\n\n163\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.567\nOption key.\n\n164\n00:08:44.567 --> 00:08:48.610\nYou're gonna see that there's a little\nhand mark key icon with a plus sign.\n\n165\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.816\nWhen I do that, that's gonna give me\nthe ability to replace that existing spot.\n\n166\n00:08:52.816 --> 00:08:56.635\nSo you see, because the colors I chose\nweren't extremely different from what one\n\n167\n00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:58.640\nanother, I'll do that as a yellow again.\n\n168\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:06.080\nIf I do that, it's going to replace\neverything that uses that swatch.\n\n169\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.630\nSo if you watch the bottom example,\n\n170\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.160\nwhere which I'm using the swatch,\nyou can see that that's gonna go ahead and\n\n171\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.150\nconvert to yellow, or\ndo whatever change that you have.\n\n172\n00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.681\nSo that's kind of a nice feature.\n\n173\n00:09:17.681 --> 00:09:20.360\nIf you think about it, and\nyou're like, how do we do this?\n\n174\n00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.175\nOr sometimes I get it pattern swatch\nfrom somebody else that I wanna change.\n\n175\n00:09:24.175 --> 00:09:25.799\nI can go ahead and edit it that way.\n\n176\n00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:26.474\n&gt;&gt; And also,\n\n177\n00:09:26.474 --> 00:09:31.349\none of the thing that I always like to\nmention with the pattern swatch is this,\n\n178\n00:09:31.349 --> 00:09:35.561\nhow big you drew your original\nsprinkles is how big the pattern is.\n\n179\n00:09:35.561 --> 00:09:37.866\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So if you wanted small sprinkles,\n\n180\n00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:42.256\nall of that kinda group up there in the\ntop left, you would make them all smaller.\n\n181\n00:09:42.256 --> 00:09:44.564\nAnd then,\ndrag them into the swatches panel and\n\n182\n00:09:44.564 --> 00:09:46.820\nthen it will repeat more\noften if you want say.\n\n183\n00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's just a smaller pattern.\n\n184\n00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So the size of the original artwork\n\n185\n00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.870\nthat you're making into the pattern,\nit does make a difference.\n\n186\n00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n187\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.962\nAlthough we are gonna get to how you can\nkind of mess with that a little bit here\n\n188\n00:10:00.962 --> 00:10:03.755\nwith our diamond pattern\nthat we're making.\n\n189\n00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:07.138\nAnd I'm sure you know what we\nare talking about it's just.\n\n190\n00:10:07.138 --> 00:10:08.937\n&gt;&gt; I think so, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n191\n00:10:08.937 --> 00:10:10.990\nshe's just never seen me do this before.\n\n192\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.855\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n193\n00:10:11.855 --> 00:10:14.287\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm also going a little bit\n\n194\n00:10:14.287 --> 00:10:18.274\nmore on that old school way of what\npatterns were in Illustrator, and\n\n195\n00:10:18.274 --> 00:10:21.434\nso that was something that I\nalways had to think of and so\n\n196\n00:10:21.434 --> 00:10:24.141\nit's one of those old\nhouse are hard to break.\n\n197\n00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:29.324\nBut I do know that they did\nexpand this whole pattern,\n\n198\n00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:34.759\neditor, repeater fun options stuff\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go outside of that,\n\n199\n00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:35.627\nyou'll know.\n\n200\n00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:37.925\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Trust me, okay, so\n\n201\n00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:41.826\nwhat we're gonna do here,\nwe are going to now take go for\n\n202\n00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:46.650\nmore organic pattern, to a pattern\nthat is repeatable on all sides.\n\n203\n00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.500\nSo we're gonna creat a diamond pattern\nis basically what I'm saying, and\n\n204\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.920\nit's going to be, and you can thin\nof kinda of a diamond pattern,\n\n205\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.570\nit's gonna be kinda of perfect.\n\n206\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.423\nSo it may seem like something as simple\nas just creating a diamond and like okay,\n\n207\n00:10:58.423 --> 00:11:00.105\nI can just drag that over, right?\n\n208\n00:11:00.105 --> 00:11:02.171\nAnd that will make a pattern out of it?\n\n209\n00:11:02.171 --> 00:11:04.160\nNot really cuz you have to think\nabout the way that they meet up.\n\n210\n00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.140\nSo, now this has several steps\ninvolved through with it.\n\n211\n00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.375\nSo, kind of just follow along\nwith me as best you can.\n\n212\n00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.690\nYou can always rewatch, or\nwhatever you need to do.\n\n213\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.690\nJust because,\nas I said the setup is the hard thing.\n\n214\n00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.325\nWe have to go through several\nsteps to set this up, and\n\n215\n00:11:20.325 --> 00:11:23.150\nthen when we create the swatch\nit's gonna be easy as pie.\n\n216\n00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.750\nSo, what I need to do, I need to start\noff with a square that has no fill and\n\n217\n00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.640\nno stroke, or a rectangle rather\nthat has no fill and no stroke.\n\n218\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.190\nNot absolutely essential that it\nhas no fill and no stroke, but\n\n219\n00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.000\nI think it's gonna help.\n\n220\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.608\nNow, I wanna go ahead and\ncreate some guides here.\n\n221\n00:11:37.608 --> 00:11:42.564\nNow you could, we kinda go back to our to\nour grids and guides episode if I go to\n\n222\n00:11:42.564 --> 00:11:46.609\nmy view menu, go to guide and\nthen make guides out of this box.\n\n223\n00:11:46.609 --> 00:11:49.071\nYes, that is an option but\nwhat I wanna do here is,\n\n224\n00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:52.060\nI wanna make sure that I\nactually keep this rectangle.\n\n225\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.358\nIf I do that and\nmake guides out of this rectangle,\n\n226\n00:11:54.358 --> 00:11:56.616\nthen it's gonna get rid\nof the rectangle for me.\n\n227\n00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:59.300\nSo I need this little guy later,\nI need him to stay.\n\n228\n00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.770\nSo I'm just gonna do it\nthe old fashioned way here.\n\n229\n00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.400\nAnd I'm going to just turn on my rulers.\n\n230\n00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.010\nIf you don't already have them,\nCmd or Ctrl+R to turn those on.\n\n231\n00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.190\nAnd then click, hold and\ndrag to create that.\n\n232\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.990\nNow you see, okay,\nthat kinda disappeared here.\n\n233\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.270\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust temporarily add a swatch to that, so\n\n234\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.840\nthat I can see where that is.\n\n235\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.829\nAnd you can see kinda snaps to it.\n\n236\n00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:23.433\nThat's snap to point working for us,\nand it's gonna kinda snap there.\n\n237\n00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:27.090\nSo I have guides now created\non all sides of my shape.\n\n238\n00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.680\nLet's make sure that those are locked,\nso those aren't getting in my way.\n\n239\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.670\nSo I'm gonna right-click on nothing,\nlock those guides and do this.\n\n240\n00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.954\nSo you're getting a little refresher\non guides with this, whether or\n\n241\n00:12:36.954 --> 00:12:38.243\nnot you realize you would.\n\n242\n00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:41.640\nAll right, now I'm gonna go ahead and\nconvert that back to having no fill and\n\n243\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.240\nno stroke.\n\n244\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.091\nNow, with my diamond pattern,\n\n245\n00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:47.322\nto have a diamond pattern I\nfirst need to have a diamond.\n\n246\n00:12:47.322 --> 00:12:51.160\nSo, what I'm gonna do here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and draw a square.\n\n247\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.090\nAnd this one I am gonna go ahead and\ngive it some color.\n\n248\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:13:00.090\nSo you can give it, I'll try and\nbranch out into some greens here.\n\n249\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.340\nSo I am going to pick out a green color\nand in order to make it a diamond,\n\n250\n00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.600\nI basically just need to\nrotate it 45 degrees.\n\n251\n00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.430\nSo I am gonna go ahead and\nrotate this, however you want to.\n\n252\n00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.800\nIf you wanna just kind of drag like that\nand kinda use your little smart guide\n\n253\n00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.620\nthere to kinda tell you, okay,\nthat's probably exactly what I need.\n\n254\n00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.410\nOr you could also right click Transform,\n\n255\n00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.030\nRotate, and then just type in 45\ndegrees or something like that.\n\n256\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.440\nSo, that's another option that\nyou have available to you.\n\n257\n00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.340\nNow, I'm gonna select this.\n\n258\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.510\nNow, I need to put\nthe center of this diamond\n\n259\n00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.920\nin each of those corners\nwhere my guides meet.\n\n260\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.440\nSo just watch what I'm doing here.\n\n261\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.440\nI'm going to go ahead and\nI'm gonna duplicate this, and\n\n262\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.530\nI'm gonna put the very center of it,\nexactly where those guides are connecting.\n\n263\n00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.170\nAnd I'm just gonna do that for\nall four corners.\n\n264\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:53.230\nSo I'm gonna duplicate that here, center\nthere, duplicate that here, center there.\n\n265\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.150\nYou may wanna hold down your shift key to\nmake sure you're drawing this perfectly\n\n266\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.140\nstraight as well.\n\n267\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.700\nSo I'm using Alt and Shift to make sure\nI'm drawing something perfectly straight.\n\n268\n00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.150\nAnd now, we are left with that.\n\n269\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.940\nSo you've got diamonds,\na diamond in the middle and\n\n270\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.620\nthen a diamond on all four corners.\n\n271\n00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.050\nNow, I do wanna double check here,\n\n272\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.990\nthat my diamond was in that\ncenter of that original square.\n\n273\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.030\nOkay, yes, looks good.\n\n274\n00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.440\nSo, I can see that with my smart guides.\n\n275\n00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.380\nI can see center,\ncuz it's still picking up, don't forget,\n\n276\n00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.710\nwe have this original rectangle.\n\n277\n00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:20.620\nI said square.\n\n278\n00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.210\nRectangle that has no fill and\nno stroke, and\n\n279\n00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.990\nyou're probably wondering,\nwhere's that gonna come into play?\n\n280\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.280\nSo what I need to do, weird step,\nbut I need to arrange and\n\n281\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.470\nI need to bring this to the front.\n\n282\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.320\nSo I need to bring this to\nthe front of all of my objects.\n\n283\n00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.280\nI'm laughing cuz Vonne's on the side.\n\n284\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:36.924\nShe's like.\n\n285\n00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:38.122\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:14:38.122 --> 00:14:39.330\n&gt;&gt; What's going on here?\n\n287\n00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.860\nSo kinda going back to those layers,\nI need to make\n\n288\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.520\nsure that this square with no fill and\nno stroke is all the way in the front.\n\n289\n00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.991\nSo I'm gonna right-click,\nArrange, Bring to front.\n\n290\n00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:54.211\nSo I now have that\nrectangle with no fill and\n\n291\n00:14:54.211 --> 00:14:57.140\nno stroke on top of all of my diamonds.\n\n292\n00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.160\nNow, I promise these\nsteps are gonna end soon.\n\n293\n00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.956\nSo what we are gonna do here?\n\n294\n00:15:01.956 --> 00:15:04.116\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nselect all of that so\n\n295\n00:15:04.116 --> 00:15:08.259\nall five of my diamonds are selected and\nthat rectangle with no fill and no stroke.\n\n296\n00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:10.500\nLast weird step.\n\n297\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.539\nWe are gonna go into our Pathfinder panel.\n\n298\n00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:17.390\nSo I'm gonna go to Window, and\nthen I'm gonna go down to Pathfinder.\n\n299\n00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.576\nWe are bringing in so\nmany tools into this, it's not even funny.\n\n300\n00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:22.930\nBut you're getting kind of a good\nlittle review of everything,\n\n301\n00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.320\nor maybe if you're watching\nthe episodes out of order.\n\n302\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.380\nYou can kinda see some of the other\ncool things that you can do.\n\n303\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.578\nSo I'm gonna grab all that, and\nthen from my Pathfinder panel,\n\n304\n00:15:31.578 --> 00:15:34.477\nI wanna go ahead and\nselect the Crop option.\n\n305\n00:15:34.477 --> 00:15:37.037\nBasically, what that is gonna do is,\n\n306\n00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:41.837\nis gonna crop all of the extra diamond\nout of what's in that rectangle.\n\n307\n00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:48.030\nSo I only want, basically a quarter\nof it left in our final product here.\n\n308\n00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.830\nSo I'm gonna hit Crop.\n\n309\n00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.360\n&gt;&gt; And that's why you brought\nthe rectangle to the front.\n\n310\n00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.995\nAnd I was like,\nwhy is she changing the stacking order?\n\n311\n00:15:55.995 --> 00:16:01.229\nIt was because this next step is\nthat the rectangle is being used\n\n312\n00:16:01.229 --> 00:16:07.574\nas the boundaries of the cropping that\nyou did on all of the selected Shapes.\n\n313\n00:16:07.574 --> 00:16:08.099\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n314\n00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:09.787\n&gt;&gt; Got you!\n\n315\n00:16:09.787 --> 00:16:11.466\n&gt;&gt; So that mysterious rectangle,\n\n316\n00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:15.320\nthe invisible rectangle actually\ndoes play a crucial role in this.\n\n317\n00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.130\nAnd then from here, you can be glad.\n\n318\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.820\nAll of the prep work is done.\n\n319\n00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.070\nSo all I'm going to do now is,\nI'm just going to hide these guys,\n\n320\n00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.120\nI don't want to look at them anymore.\n\n321\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.250\nI don't want them to get\nin the way of the fun.\n\n322\n00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.690\nSo I'm just going to click, hold and\n\n323\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.730\ndrag this into my swatches panel\nto create a swatch out of it.\n\n324\n00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.710\n&gt;&gt; And just one little, that did make\nan automatic group, when you use the crop.\n\n325\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Why didn't I have to select everything?\n\n326\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:44.860\nThat's just the command that you use\nin the pathfinder to result to a group.\n\n327\n00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n328\n00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.100\nExcellent point, so I'm only picking\nthe one and it's selecting everything.\n\n329\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.060\nI already went ahead and drag and\ndropped there, but I'll go ahead and\n\n330\n00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.890\ndo it again just in case you missed it and\nI can go ahead and get rid of this.\n\n331\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.120\nAnd then now I'm just\ngoing to apply my pattern.\n\n332\n00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.430\nSo now I have my diamond pattern.\n\n333\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.530\nIt's repeated on all sides.\n\n334\n00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.570\nSame rules apply if I try and\nmake this smaller.\n\n335\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.860\nMy diamond is gonna be a little\nbit squished, things like that.\n\n336\n00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.970\nAnd in this case, a lot of where the size\nof our diamond pattern comes into play was\n\n337\n00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.440\nthe amount of space that\nwe had in our rectangles.\n\n338\n00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.730\nBecause I had a longer rectangle,\n\n339\n00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.330\nthat extra space is creating\nthe extra space between my diamonds.\n\n340\n00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.420\nNow Vonne was mentioning earlier, okay,\n\n341\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.920\nthis is all determined by the size\nthat you make your pattern.\n\n342\n00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.410\nAnd yes, that's true.\n\n343\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.970\nBut you can also transform it.\n\n344\n00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.270\nAnd she's like uh-huh, uh-huh,\nuh-huh I knew where you were going.\n\n345\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.650\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go to Object Transform and\n\n346\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.030\nthen I'm gonna go down to Scale.\n\n347\n00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.680\nSo Object, Transform, Scale.\n\n348\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.030\nIn this case you say whoa that\njust made it a whole lot smaller.\n\n349\n00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.000\nHere's what I want to pay attention to.\n\n350\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.600\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n351\n00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.250\nset that back at 100 that's probably\nwhat you're looking at on your screen.\n\n352\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:58.020\nOne thing that you want to be aware of,\nturn off transform objects.\n\n353\n00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.350\nSo by default Illustrator is going\nto want to transform the object and\n\n354\n00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.160\nthe pattern itself.\n\n355\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.280\nSo I'm going to turn off\nthat transform object and\n\n356\n00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.610\nthen now I'm going to go back to\nthe top here with this uniform, but\n\n357\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.350\nyou do wanna make sure Transform Patterns\nis on, I should point that out.\n\n358\n00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.620\nTransform patterns needs to be on.\n\n359\n00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.040\nGo back to this uniform.\n\n360\n00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.250\nAnd go ahead and either use your up and\ndown arrow keys to go ahead and\n\n361\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.170\nmake that larger or smaller.\n\n362\n00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.560\nOr do whatever you need to do if you\nwanna go ahead and type something in.\n\n363\n00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.270\nI'm just gonna use my up and\ndown arrow keys and\n\n364\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.445\nselect that to where I get something,\nit's like, okay.\n\n365\n00:18:28.445 --> 00:18:30.750\nNow I have those smaller\ndiamonds I was looking for.\n\n366\n00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.595\nAnd that's all those steps.\n\n367\n00:18:33.595 --> 00:18:36.472\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't even expecting that.\n\n368\n00:18:36.472 --> 00:18:39.410\n&gt;&gt; yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know about the scale\n\n369\n00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.300\nwith the pattern.\n\n370\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because I was going,\n\n371\n00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.830\nwhere is she going?\n\n372\n00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.730\nThere's that check box right\nthere on the transform now!\n\n373\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.820\nThat's neat.\n\n374\n00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.990\nThat's good stuff.\n\n375\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.920\n&gt;&gt; I like that I can see your facial\nexpressions as I'm talking as I can always\n\n376\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.282\nsee if she's like, okay, okay.\n\n377\n00:18:57.282 --> 00:18:59.995\n[LAUGH] Where is she going?\n\n378\n00:18:59.995 --> 00:19:01.793\nYeah, it's just funny.\n\n379\n00:19:01.793 --> 00:19:02.690\n[LAUGH].\n\n380\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.030\nI like when I can surprise you.\n\n381\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.912\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm here for\nto entertain you.\n\n382\n00:19:07.912 --> 00:19:08.803\n[LAUGH].\n\n383\n00:19:08.803 --> 00:19:09.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nYes.\n\n384\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.382\nOkay.\nWell, thank you.\n\n385\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.000\nSo yeah, I think that's\na good overview of patterns.\n\n386\n00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.770\nNow certainly patterns again is easier or\nas difficult as you wanna make it,\n\n387\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.040\nwe're hardly even I feel like\nscratching the surface on patterns.\n\n388\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.800\nBut that's a good core idea of\nhow to actually create one.\n\n389\n00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.530\nSo remember, you have your organic,\n\n390\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.590\nyou have that kinda\nrepeatable on all sides and\n\n391\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:33.170\nbe thinking about how you can translate\nthat into other things in the future.\n\n392\n00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.920\n&gt;&gt; And do you mind if I append\n\n393\n00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.250\nsomething to this-\n&gt;&gt; No, please.\n\n394\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.810\n&gt;&gt; About the pattern swatches and\nthe libraries that you have?\n\n395\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:41.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n396\n00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so just like we had the libraries.\n\n397\n00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.890\nAnd I don't remember if we had\ndone this in the swatches episode.\n\n398\n00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.240\nSo excuse me if you're like, wait,\nyou guys already did that once before.\n\n399\n00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.300\nBut just like we talked about,\nthe gradients, and the solid colors, you\n\n400\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.250\ndo have patterns here, in a little book\ndown at the bottom there's the patterns.\n\n401\n00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.540\nDid we do this?\n\n402\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.814\nWell maybe, anyway [CROSSTALK]\n[LAUGH] We had the basic patterns, and\n\n403\n00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:09.330\nyou have the dots and the lines, and\nyou can see that you can go into this.\n\n404\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.670\nAnd just like you had done to where hey\nI wanna go ahead and edit this pattern,\n\n405\n00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:20.530\nonce you add it into your swatch's panel,\nyou con then drag and drop it out onto it.\n\n406\n00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:25.410\nI actually kind of like to start with\na lot of the patterns that are in this\n\n407\n00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:30.520\nlibrary first And say,\nI really like that particular one.\n\n408\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.970\nLet me go ahead and now wherever\nits yellow I wanna make it pink.\n\n409\n00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:38.020\nAnd so that whole idea of what she was\nshowing you on how to edit sprinkles,\n\n410\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:44.320\nyou could do the same thing here with\nsome of those and, animal skins, foliage.\n\n411\n00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.370\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Animal skins made me nervous,\n\n412\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.972\nso I just went straight to foliage.\n\n413\n00:20:47.972 --> 00:20:49.841\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like, that sounds intense.\n\n414\n00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:51.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so some of those,\n\n415\n00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.470\nyou can see they're a little bit\nmore intense, if you wanna say.\n\n416\n00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you can change the scale like we\n\n417\n00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.770\nhad done the transform, but\njust in case you were like,\n\n418\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.060\nI don't know what to do as a pattern.\n\n419\n00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.510\nStart with what they have in the swatches\nlibrary, and then you can go and\n\n420\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.860\ndo all the same steps that we just did,\nbut just start there.\n\n421\n00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n422\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.700\njust what I'll run through in there, just\ncuz there's a lot of them in there I don't\n\n423\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.676\nwanna have to think about anymore [LAUGH].\n\n424\n00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:18.702\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah. Yeah.\nDon't even think about it.\n\n425\n00:21:18.702 --> 00:21:19.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n426\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.480\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n427\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.145\nIt's efficient.\n\n428\n00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:21.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n429\n00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.910\nDefinitely efficient.\n\n430\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.210\nWell that's a great\nintroduction to patterns.\n\n431\n00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.840\nYou have lots of fun stuff that\nyou can do to play around with and\n\n432\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.480\nbe able to make your own.\n\n433\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.410\nEdit the ones that we already have in\nthere and that sounds like a lot of fun.\n\n434\n00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.030\nSo go have fun and pattern it up.\n\n435\n00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:38.900\nPattern it up?\n\n436\n00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what I just said.\n\n437\n00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.772\nOkay, I think that's time that we\nneed to go ahead and wrap this up.\n\n438\n00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:47.660\n[LAUGH] Signing off for CreativeProTV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n439\n00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.710\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n440\n00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:49.845\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n441\n00:21:49.845 --> 00:21:55.460\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Hey I'm good,\nI like that sharing is caring shout out,\n\n9\n00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.440\nI'm like okay,\nwhere's she gonna go with this one.\n\n10\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.980\nLike we gotta pep it up a little bit,\nso yeah, sharing is\n\n11\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.342\ncaring basically is what we're gonna be\ntalking about with our sharing swatches.\n\n12\n00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:46.120\nSo really here with sharing swatches\n\n13\n00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.490\nprobably notice we've also mention\nthat Swatches are document specific.\n\n14\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.908\nSo obviously there has to be some\nways to get around it, right?\n\n15\n00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:58.038\nSo if you're working with specific client,\nor on specific project, a lot of times\n\n16\n00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:01.703\nyour files, you're gonna be using some\nof the same colors over and over.\n\n17\n00:01:01.703 --> 00:01:05.877\nSo if I'm a company, I have this\ndesignated color palette that I work with,\n\n18\n00:01:05.877 --> 00:01:08.156\nhow can I make my life\na little bit easier,\n\n19\n00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:11.930\nin terms of actually sharing\nthose swatches between files?\n\n20\n00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.300\nSo what I want to do,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n21\n00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.030\njump in here in Illustrator,and I\njust wanna make\n\n22\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.500\na couple of swatches real quick, so\nI'm just gonna, maybe I'll do it your way.\n\n23\n00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.730\nI'm gonna use my Color Panel.\n\n24\n00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.820\n&gt;&gt; That's why you started\ngoing there like, which way,\n\n25\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.900\nI almost like wanna narrate\nthe thoughts and my brain was like,\n\n26\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.244\nwhich way should I go to make a swatch.\n\n27\n00:01:29.244 --> 00:01:30.740\nLet's go over here [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n28\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.880\nhadn't thought through that part yet\n[LAUGH] all right.\n\n29\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.130\nSo, however you want to make a swatch,\nit's up to you.\n\n30\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.640\nI'm doing it Vonne's way,\nbecause she likes to use her Color Panel.\n\n31\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.710\nSo maybe I'll go ahead and do that.\n\n32\n00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100\nSwatches, got it, cool.\n\n33\n00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.745\nMaybe go back here, grab a couple.\n\n34\n00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:49.975\n&gt;&gt; Another little thing just in case you\nwanted to know, in the Color Panel right\n\n35\n00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:53.185\nthere on the little, I used to call\nthem the four lines in the triangle.\n\n36\n00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:55.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; The little panel options button\n\n37\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.068\non the color panel there is Add Swatch or\nCreate New Swatch, right there.\n\n38\n00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I get a point.\n\n39\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.225\n&gt;&gt; I never noticed that.\n\n40\n00:02:03.225 --> 00:02:07.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That just saved me so much time.\n\n41\n00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:10.085\nOkay, you could do it this way too.\n\n42\n00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:11.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What a life saver.\n\n43\n00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.090\nOkay go, cool, Create New Swatches\nthat you just like see.\n\n44\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it goes right into your\nSwatches Panel right from there and\n\n45\n00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:20.270\nthat's where you're like,\nwhy do you use a Color Panel?\n\n46\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.010\nI don't know it's just\nthe way that I was taught or\n\n47\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.455\nthe way I kinda go through and\nthat's how I roll [LAUGH].\n\n48\n00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:29.367\n&gt;&gt; Well I never would have thought to\nuse the Color Panel, because I was like,\n\n49\n00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:30.953\nwell how am I have to jump back over here.\n\n50\n00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:32.815\nEven as I did it, I was like,\n\n51\n00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:36.824\nthis is kind of a pain [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well and a lot of times when I have to\n\n52\n00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:41.454\nmix swatches for either CMYK and RGB,\nbecause sometimes I need to kind\n\n53\n00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:46.261\nof have both color spaces or values\nin the same file and you're like why?\n\n54\n00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:48.135\nIt just happens sometimes.\n\n55\n00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:53.195\nSo that's why i can switch the sliders\nin that Options of the Color Panel and\n\n56\n00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:55.535\nI guess that's probably where I found,\nI could go ahead and\n\n57\n00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:59.288\njust make a swatch right from here too so,\nmaybe that's why I knew it as well.\n\n58\n00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:00.054\n&gt;&gt; Love it.\n\n59\n00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:02.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it was, I'm feeling it, so\n\n60\n00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.350\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm just,\n\n61\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.284\nit looks like I'm making an Easter flyer\nhere [LAUGH] we have all our pastels.\n\n62\n00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:11.843\nI just for organization's sake, I'm gonna\ncreate a new color group out of these.\n\n63\n00:03:11.843 --> 00:03:15.330\nThis isn't something that's really\nrequired, but I like to do that for\n\n64\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.940\nany swatches that I am creating.\n\n65\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.177\n&gt;&gt; I think you just showed another\ncute little shortcut there, too.\n\n66\n00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:24.873\nIs like you selected the swatches first,\nand then clicked on the folder, because I\n\n67\n00:03:24.873 --> 00:03:30.090\nthink we've been always going the other\nway, make a folder, and then drag them.\n\n68\n00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.760\nSo it might make it a little easier for\nyou to do it that way and\n\n69\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.180\nthis way, or that way, same place.\n\n70\n00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.700\n&gt;&gt; Always, always in Illustrator,\ngets you every time,\n\n71\n00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.750\nso a couple of different ways\nthat we can save our swatches.\n\n72\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.850\nAnd some of these are going to depend\non what you're trying to do and\n\n73\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.770\nI'm going to be honest.\n\n74\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.850\nThe first set Is kind of the older\nway of doing it, I was trying\n\n75\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.340\nto avoid the reuse of the word older, but\nit's kind of the older way of doing it.\n\n76\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.680\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; You can call it the legacy.\n\n77\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the legacy version.\n\n78\n00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz and they do that a lot of times.\n\n79\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they do.\n\n80\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.180\n&gt;&gt; They change like, libraries or\nin the like, it's the Legacy Edition.\n\n81\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's not the old school either so\n\n82\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.640\nmuch better ways to do it now\n[LAUGH] they don't call that.\n\n83\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.190\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n84\n00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.610\nwe'll avoid that word this is\nthe legacy way of doing it but\n\n85\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.400\nI think it's important for\nyou to understand how this works.\n\n86\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.220\nOne, because it's always good to\nunderstand kind of where it's coming from\n\n87\n00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.290\nand the history with it.\n\n88\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.250\nBut two, this method is also gonna\nimpact some other things you can do in\n\n89\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.380\nIllustrator, it's going to be similar to\nother methods you can use in Illustrator.\n\n90\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.820\nSo, I'm gonna take this Swatches panel,\nyou obviously,\n\n91\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.690\nif you're saving your swatches,\nyou may have more than this.\n\n92\n00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.960\nSo I'm just sticking with three, but\neven if you just have the actual\n\n93\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.920\nthree that you added,\nIt's still gonna be useful.\n\n94\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.090\nI'm in my snatches panel,\nI'm going to go into the options panel.\n\n95\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.410\nThere's three lines in the top\nright ahead corner and\n\n96\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.270\nthen if I go all the way\ndown to the bottom.\n\n97\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.620\nSee how I have this?\n\n98\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.020\nSave Swatch Library as ASE and\n\n99\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.710\nSave Swatch Library as AI, so\nwhat's kind of the deal with these?\n\n100\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.165\nSaving a swatch library as\nan AI file will make it.\n\n101\n00:05:04.165 --> 00:05:06.885\nSomething that you can use\nin other Illustrator files.\n\n102\n00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:10.155\nSo we know AI is an Illustrator file.\n\n103\n00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:12.685\nI can then share between\nIllustrator files.\n\n104\n00:05:12.685 --> 00:05:17.785\nASE is gonna be something that I can\nshare across other Adobe programs.\n\n105\n00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:21.565\nIf I wanted to open it up in Photoshop,\nor InDesign, or something like that.\n\n106\n00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:24.805\nNow you're probably thinking, why\nwouldn't I just save everything as ASE.\n\n107\n00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:30.520\nWell, In AI, you can get specific with\nthings like gradients and patterns.\n\n108\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.850\nSo gradients and\npatterns will not work in our ASE version.\n\n109\n00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.320\nAnd you kind of see that later, though.\n\n110\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.470\nI think it'll give you a little\npop-up warning to let you know that.\n\n111\n00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.240\nBut if I just specifically want to\nshare within Illustrator files.\n\n112\n00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.740\nI don't care about going into Photoshop,\n\n113\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.850\nany other program, then I can just\ndo save swatch library as AI.\n\n114\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.680\nGo ahead, just leave it\nwherever it is on your screen.\n\n115\n00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.760\nSo you can see mine here, and you can also\nsee I have several already saved, and\n\n116\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.820\nthose will kind of come\nup again here later.\n\n117\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.580\nI can go ahead and hit Save,\nwell, I'll title this, so\n\n118\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.500\nwe'll call this CreativePrep,\ngo ahead and hit Save.\n\n119\n00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.170\nAnd then you're probably not gonna\nsee anything different, right?\n\n120\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.580\nSo what we see cuz all\nwe've done is save that.\n\n121\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.470\nIf I go ahead and do a file new,\nI open something else,\n\n122\n00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.300\nokay, all those additional three\nthat I added Had disappeared.\n\n123\n00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.070\nHow do I go ahead and load this in here?\n\n124\n00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.940\nSo, I'm gonna go back into my swatches\npanel and then, I'm sorry, wrong start,.\n\n125\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.160\nI'm gonna go into my swatch library.\n\n126\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.010\nSo, when I go down here,\nI go down to user defined,\n\n127\n00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.450\nThis is where you will see those\nswatches that you have saved.\n\n128\n00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.710\nSo you can see I have several\nother class examples here but\n\n129\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.020\nthen I also have used them for\nmy clients in the past.\n\n130\n00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.930\nSo all those letters that mean nothing\nto you are things that I have used in\n\n131\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.650\nan actual professional sense.\n\n132\n00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.400\n&gt;&gt; I love the one with the underscore two\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n133\n00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.300\n&gt;&gt; That's like, I messed up the first one,\n\n134\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.997\nyeah [LAUGH].\n\n135\n00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:56.670\n&gt;&gt; I have so many of those [LAUGH].\n\n136\n00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.950\n&gt;&gt; Whoops [LAUGH], that's always when I'm\nlike, I forgot to add certain colors.\n\n137\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.350\nAnd then now what you'll see,\n\n138\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.490\nit actually creates this own\ncreative pro swatches panel.\n\n139\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.610\nAnd one thing that you're probably\nnoticing here is that that's not just\n\n140\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.890\n&gt;&gt; Those three that I added.\n\n141\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.830\nIt actually saves everything\nall over again so\n\n142\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.630\nthat is something that you\ndo wanna just kind of note.\n\n143\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.280\nThere's not really something you're gonna\ndo about it but something that you wanna\n\n144\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.830\nnote so that again is for\nworking within Illustrator files.\n\n145\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.360\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes when I'm\nsaving my own swash library.\n\n146\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.540\n&gt;&gt; I'll remove all the other\ndefault swatches first,\n\n147\n00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.040\nand kind of get a blank\nswatches all together.\n\n148\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.990\nGo ahead and add in all my colors\nthat I want, and then save that.\n\n149\n00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.020\nSo it kinda avoids the duplication of\n\n150\n00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.860\nall of your normal stuff if you want to\nsay and all the things that you've made.\n\n151\n00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.070\nYou can see what she's doing right\nthere is she's just selecting\n\n152\n00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.500\nAll of the swatches that are there.\n\n153\n00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.000\nI don't think you can get rid of the none.\n\n154\n00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I dont think you can.\n\n155\n00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.890\nI couldn't tell if it was the none or\nthe registry.\n\n156\n00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.790\nI think it's both of them\nyou can't get rid of.\n\n157\n00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.240\nBut, even still, it's actually going\nto make your life a lot easier.\n\n158\n00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.880\nSo, yes,\nthat's definitely something I've done.\n\n159\n00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.790\n&gt;&gt; And that's what you save out,\njust like we did with the steps.\n\n160\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.530\nAnd, I don't get everything else.\n\n161\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.970\nSo, just a little tip, you know from.\n\n162\n00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.540\nFor me, I'm always chiming in with\nthose little things like, hey,\n\n163\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.392\nthis is how I do it.\n\n164\n00:08:18.392 --> 00:08:18.924\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n165\n00:08:18.924 --> 00:08:19.655\nYou have great tips though.\n\n166\n00:08:19.655 --> 00:08:20.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's great.\n\n167\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.620\nSo what, okay,\nwe just save that as an AI file and\n\n168\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.080\nnow we opened it up in\nanother illustrator program.\n\n169\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.090\nAgain that's gonna come in handy.\n\n170\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.060\nIf I had a gradient swatch or\n\n171\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.560\na pattern swatch that I've\nspecifically wanted to save.\n\n172\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.190\nNow, just to show you how it's done, I can\nalso save this swatch library as an ASE.\n\n173\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.110\nSo ASC is gonna be something I can open up\nin other programs to save swatch libraries\n\n174\n00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.800\nASC you're gonna get the same thing you\ncan see I've got basically the same\n\n175\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.340\noptions here and I can save this as\ncreative pro now I'm just gonna go ahead\n\n176\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.970\nand hit cancel because I'm not actually\ngonna open up another program.\n\n177\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.480\nBut basically if you were to\ngo into another Adobe program,\n\n178\n00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.180\nyou know Photoshop and Design they're\nall gonna have basically the same thing.\n\n179\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.660\nIt's gonna be like this, load swatches.\n\n180\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.720\nSomething to that effect.\n\n181\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.520\n&gt;&gt; And when I save the ASE swatches,\nI always put that on my desktop.\n\n182\n00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.520\nCuz the location of where\nyou're saving your ASE,\n\n183\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.470\nyou wanna remember where that's at.\n\n184\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; When you're saving it as the\n\n185\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.510\n&gt;&gt; AI file, when you save it,\n\n186\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.840\nI don't know if you noticed.\n\n187\n00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.990\nIt was way down in the program files.\n\n188\n00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.970\nIt's in her user profile,\nin Adobe, in Illustrator.\n\n189\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.396\nIt goes way, way, way down.\n\n190\n00:09:25.396 --> 00:09:26.740\n&gt;&gt; It's no [LAUGH].\n\n191\n00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna keep that for\nAI libraries.\n\n192\n00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.250\nASE, put it somewhere\nyou're gonna remember it,\n\n193\n00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.500\ncuz you won't be able to\nFind Brad again [LAUGH].\n\n194\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.490\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I never remember those paths, so.\n\n195\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.280\nAnd then like she said, in Photoshop or\nInDesign, in all the swatches panels,\n\n196\n00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.800\nthere will be that same\nPanel Options button and then Open.\n\n197\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.309\nI think it's just Open or Load.\n\n198\n00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:49.571\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n199\n00:09:49.571 --> 00:09:50.753\nI think it's Load in InDesign, so yeah.\n\n200\n00:09:50.753 --> 00:09:53.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then you find it and\nyou go out to that ASE file.\n\n201\n00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.420\nAnd it will load in all of your\nSolid swatches reinforcing\n\n202\n00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.968\nwhat she said about it's not gonna\ncarry over the gradient to the pattern\n\n203\n00:09:59.968 --> 00:10:01.539\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n204\n00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:03.030\nRight.\nNow we mentioned,\n\n205\n00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.550\nbefore I get into the kind of newer method\n\n206\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.205\nof doing that just to point this\n&gt;&gt; This out to you while we're\n\n207\n00:10:09.205 --> 00:10:11.135\nkinda been of habit of doing this method.\n\n208\n00:10:11.135 --> 00:10:15.995\nThis is also gonna work for things like\nbrushes, we create new brushes, it's also\n\n209\n00:10:15.995 --> 00:10:19.025\ngonna work for our graphic styles if\nyou're adding any graphics styles,\n\n210\n00:10:19.025 --> 00:10:23.925\nyou can always go here and Save Graphics\nStyle Library so that while later\n\n211\n00:10:23.925 --> 00:10:27.035\nwhen you open up a new illustrator\ndocument you can use that again.\n\n212\n00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:29.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it is brushes.\n\n213\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.080\nSymbols.\n\n214\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n215\n00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Wich in the order we haven't\ngotten it to there yet.\n\n216\n00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.260\nSo brushes, symbols, styles and swatches.\n\n217\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.180\nThey all have the same exact\nprocedure of what she has showed you\n\n218\n00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.850\nto be able to use those across\nother files within illustrator.\n\n219\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.790\nObviously the brushes and the styles,\n\n220\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.050\nthey're not gonna translate\ninto your other products.\n\n221\n00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.030\nBecause those are very specific\nIllustrator tools like\n\n222\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.080\nthose brushes in Photoshop.\n\n223\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.550\nThey are apples and oranges.\n\n224\n00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.220\nThey are not the same thing.\n\n225\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:10:59.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n226\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.870\nAnd that's a great point too.\n\n227\n00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.770\nThose are specific just to Illustrator.\n\n228\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.795\nNow.\n\n229\n00:11:04.795 --> 00:11:07.795\nI know the newer method of doing this.\n\n230\n00:11:07.795 --> 00:11:10.255\nIt would be to use your CC Library.\n\n231\n00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:12.435\nCC LIbraries are awesome.\n\n232\n00:11:12.435 --> 00:11:15.225\nTook me a hot minute to\nget used to it really,\n\n233\n00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:17.907\nbecause I kinda just was used to doing\nit the old fashioned In a way and\n\n234\n00:11:17.907 --> 00:11:22.737\nthen when I discovered this and\nreally started using it [INAUDIBLE] Like I\n\n235\n00:11:22.737 --> 00:11:27.687\nwas telling her kinda before we got on\nhere how much I use them for my clients.\n\n236\n00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.757\ndefinitely comes in handy because\nthe thing with cc libraries\n\n237\n00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:32.597\nit kinda combining a lot\nof stuff into one.\n\n238\n00:11:32.597 --> 00:11:35.247\nWhat we can do is we're\ngonna do our swatches but\n\n239\n00:11:35.247 --> 00:11:37.137\nthen also note you that\nyou can do graphic.\n\n240\n00:11:37.137 --> 00:11:40.397\nA lot of times I do this for\nthings like a logo like if I go ahead and\n\n241\n00:11:40.397 --> 00:11:43.300\ncreate a logo for my client and\nillustrator I can drag and\n\n242\n00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.890\ndrop that asset, and then it's gonna\nhave not necessarily a vector file, but\n\n243\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.750\nit's gonna give me that image\nto work with in other documents.\n\n244\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.840\nSo see how it says, if I open up this,\nDrag And Drop Assets?\n\n245\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.620\nThat's because they want to really\nemphasize that point that it's\n\n246\n00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.270\nnot just color, But it's other things.\n\n247\n00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.500\nIf you were working with character\nstyles and paragraph styles especially\n\n248\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.440\nthat's something very common in\nIn Design you can use fonts like woah.\n\n249\n00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.610\nYou can have all of those\nsaved which is huge for\n\n250\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.210\nyour work, just for your workload.\n\n251\n00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.620\n&gt;&gt; So if you had a paragraph style in\nIn Design you put it into your CC library.\n\n252\n00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.350\nIn theory,\nyou could open this up in illustrator,\n\n253\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.880\nuse that same paragraph style right there?\n\n254\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n255\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.560\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; It's not\n\n256\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.769\nsomething I personally use very often so\nmaybe don't [INAUDIBLE] me on it but,\n\n257\n00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:33.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz I'm sure there's a little bit,\n\n258\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.330\n&gt;&gt; There's a little difference.\n\n259\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nLost in translation that you might wanna,\n\n260\n00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.720\nthat might occur with that but\n\n261\n00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.470\nthis is again one of those newer\nCC Things, that they keep evolving\n\n262\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.610\nas why you want to use this subscription-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n263\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:52.130\n&gt;&gt; And it's really almost the only way\nyou can purchase these products anymore,\n\n264\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:58.350\nbut just that cross\n&gt;&gt; Program capabilities,\n\n265\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.450\nof what this library can do.\n\n266\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:03.160\nThis is where I would be like,\nwell can I do this, can I save that,\n\n267\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.620\nwill it translate, and\nI probably push it to its limits.\n\n268\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.640\nBut It's just nice to be able to know\nthat you can have that one place to put\n\n269\n00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.140\nmultiple things across all of it, because\n&gt;&gt; As designer, I guess I'm working\n\n270\n00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:22.290\nall through products all the time when I'm\ndoing something, Illustrator, end design,\n\n271\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:27.450\nand Photoshop they're always open working\nbetween them, so this is pretty awesome.\n\n272\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:32.420\nAgain, just most light bulbs are going\noff of my head I was just like, okay,\n\n273\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.870\nI'm getting into my own stuff\nthat I'm freelancing again.\n\n274\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:41.490\n&gt;&gt; Here and there and I'm gonna be so\nmuch more efficient and so cool.\n\n275\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.700\nI'm very happy.\n\n276\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.640\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be efficient and\ncool, not just efficient.\n\n277\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.980\nYes, so with this I think it's kind\nof important to just re-emphasize\n\n278\n00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.800\nour CC libraries are not\ntied just to Illustrator.\n\n279\n00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.800\nThere's something that\ntransfers across all programs.\n\n280\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.550\nSo when I put something in my CC libraries\nI can then open up in an InDesign.\n\n281\n00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.400\nI can open it up in Photoshop.\n\n282\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.870\nIt is gonna be there available for\nme in all these platforms.\n\n283\n00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.860\nGonna be there for me in Illustrator\ntoo if I opening up another file but\n\n284\n00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.270\nit's also gonna be available in\nall of these other platforms.\n\n285\n00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.520\nSo what I can do here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and grab that.\n\n286\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.820\nI have that new swatch that I created.\n\n287\n00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.220\nThen now I'm gonna select this.\n\n288\n00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.380\nThere's one thing that I wanna\nnote before I go ahead and\n\n289\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.110\nadd this into my My libraries.\n\n290\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.460\nNow you see you can drag and\ndrop but if I try and just drag and\n\n291\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.200\ndrop this what's gonna happen is it's\ngonna try and save that as a graphic.\n\n292\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.530\nSo it's actually looking\nat the art work itself.\n\n293\n00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.515\nNow I'm gonna command or control z.\n\n294\n00:14:32.515 --> 00:14:33.360\nNever mind.\n\n295\n00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.010\nWhen I do that it doesn't\nget rid of it but\n\n296\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.660\nthat shows you exactly how\nto delete something here.\n\n297\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.460\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n298\n00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.520\njust delete that option there because\nI don't need the square, right.\n\n299\n00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.650\nI can do a square somewhere else.\n\n300\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.910\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on this plus sign.\n\n301\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.880\nAnd what you see here is, you want to\ngo ahead select okay am I going to add\n\n302\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.090\nthe Graphic Or\nam I gonna add the fill color, or both.\n\n303\n00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.710\nSo right now I just wanna work\nwith fill color selected.\n\n304\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:00.410\nGo ahead and hit add and then now you're\ngonna see all of your colors pop up.\n\n305\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.680\nAnd if were to do this, and\nlet's just pretend I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n306\n00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.860\nmake a logo here.\n\n307\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.280\nWe'll use some of our\ncolors that we created.\n\n308\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.520\nThis is gonna be a Interesting\nlogo that I'm working with here.\n\n309\n00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.960\nSo we'll just call this company or\ncompay you know, whatever.\n\n310\n00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.040\nWe'll test my spelling while on camera.\n\n311\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.560\nCompany we're gonna call that.\n\n312\n00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.135\nI got rid of all my swatches.\n\n313\n00:15:26.135 --> 00:15:28.760\n[LAUGH] I wanted to go ahead and\nmake that white.\n\n314\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.400\nhere, we will cheat it.\n\n315\n00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.160\nWe will use our eye dropper tool.\n\n316\n00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:31.810\nHere we go.\n\n317\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.155\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, you are so efficient.\n\n318\n00:15:33.155 --> 00:15:34.076\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm so efficient.\n\n319\n00:15:34.076 --> 00:15:35.600\n[LAUGH] So we will take that.\n\n320\n00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.430\nWe will call it our logo,\nyou know, whatever.\n\n321\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.910\nGo ahead and go back into our libraries,\nnow I can drag and drop that.\n\n322\n00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.710\nAnd you're going to see how it's going\nto separate everything out for you, so\n\n323\n00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.340\nit's going to separate out your colors,\nit's going to separate out your graphics.\n\n324\n00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.000\nAnd then now, if I want to apply those,\nI can go ahead and\n\n325\n00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.240\njust select that color there.\n\n326\n00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.240\nLikewise, I can drag and\ndrop my graphics out.\n\n327\n00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.120\nSo, that is just a fantastic\noption that you have.\n\n328\n00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.140\nNow you'll notice this is an image.\n\n329\n00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.550\nI'm not pulling out a vector graphic and\n\n330\n00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.560\nthat's because you need to be able to\ntranslate it into the other program.\n\n331\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.320\nSo that it is something that you\ndo wanna pay attention to and yes,\n\n332\n00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.740\nNola it'll kind of let you know\nyou created that in Aeonic.\n\n333\n00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.140\n&gt;&gt; So if you brought that\nsquare into it would still\n\n334\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.690\n&gt;&gt; It automatically translates it\n\n335\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.360\ninto an image.\n\n336\n00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.160\nIt will not stay through vector.\n\n337\n00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.880\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n338\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n339\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.150\nthat is kind of one of the down sides\ncuz I want it to be a vector if I'm\n\n340\n00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.180\nworking in illustrator.\n\n341\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.890\nAgain, I want to be able\nto save those vectors but\n\n342\n00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.740\nit does translate it to-\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking it also into in design\n\n343\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.590\nbecause you can do a lot of same\nthings you can do with like\n\n344\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.590\n&gt;&gt; Squares and paths and there's all those\n\n345\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:48.680\nthings in In Design so if I had some\nvector information here that I wanted to\n\n346\n00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.900\nuse in my Illustrator file I can't really\nkind of do it through the CC library.\n\n347\n00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n348\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.260\nYou could copy paste.\n\n349\n00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.310\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; Always go back to the copy and\n\n350\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.140\npaste, right?\n\n351\n00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.090\nSo yeah but I'd\n&gt;&gt; Still definitely think you know my CC\n\n352\n00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.690\nlibraries if nothing else just for color.\n\n353\n00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.020\nHaving to choose color swatches over and\nover again.\n\n354\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.740\nI was telling her the example I have\na client that I work with that has\n\n355\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.755\nprobably five different colors for\nfive different divisions.\n\n356\n00:17:14.755 --> 00:17:18.925\nand so having to keep up with all those\nswatches, it's so easy in my CC libraries.\n\n357\n00:17:18.925 --> 00:17:21.565\nEspecially bouncing back and\nforth between the programs.\n\n358\n00:17:21.565 --> 00:17:24.895\nSo, I really think that it's something\nyou'll probably find you're using a lot.\n\n359\n00:17:24.895 --> 00:17:27.590\nCC libraries have continued to evolve.\n\n360\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.750\n&gt;&gt; With every release of Illustrator, so\n\n361\n00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.660\nit's something that will probably continue\nto change, and just get better and better.\n\n362\n00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.190\nSo maybe even that vectorizing thing will\nkind of come into play, so we'll see.\n\n363\n00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.142\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or we're holding our fingers,\nwe're holding our fingers?\n\n364\n00:17:41.142 --> 00:17:41.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.090\n&gt;&gt; We're holding hope\n\n366\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.530\n&gt;&gt; And crossing our fingers,\n\n367\n00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.325\nI think that's what I was trying to say.\n\n368\n00:17:46.325 --> 00:17:48.410\n[LAUGH] You know it's\nall blending together.\n\n369\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.225\n&gt;&gt; You have a visual.\n\n370\n00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:50.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n371\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.050\nAnd I also think that I'm\nexcited about our blend,\n\n372\n00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.110\nthat I believe is next on the list.\n\n373\n00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.640\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n374\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.770\n&gt;&gt; And you're going to love that, so-\n&gt;&gt; I love the gland.\n\n375\n00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:01.710\n&gt;&gt; So much fun!\n\n376\n00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.560\nWell, I think we're going to go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n377\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.090\nAnd signing for Creative Pro TV,\nI'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n378\n00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:09.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n379\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:10.915\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n380\n00:18:10.915 --> 00:18:16.674\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n",

edition of CreativeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.820\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n5\n00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.450\nwe're continuing on with,\nyes, Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n6\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.121\nAnd here to help us talk what\nwe are gonna talk about,\n\n7\n00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:25.772\nwhich I think is the blend tool?\n\n8\n00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:26.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n9\n00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:27.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n10\n00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:28.045\n&gt;&gt; That's what we are talking about.\n\n11\n00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:29.148\n&gt;&gt; The blend tool.\n&gt;&gt; If it's not, it is now.\n\n12\n00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:32.531\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.495\n&gt;&gt; Miss Emily Ramsey, thank you for\n\n14\n00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:38.320\ncoming back, yet again,\nin talking about one of my favorites.\n\n15\n00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.048\nI know, I have so many favorites but\nI do love this one.\n\n16\n00:00:42.048 --> 00:00:44.728\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, this is a jazz\nhands moment with the blend tool,\n\n17\n00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:45.770\n[LAUGH] it's exciting.\n\n18\n00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.250\nSo, basically, what the blend\ntool does is it's gonna allow you\n\n19\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.978\nto blend multiple different objects,\nmultiple different colors,\n\n20\n00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:58.170\nall kinds of different\nthings into one piece.\n\n21\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.940\nNot even necessarily one piece but\nit just kind of blends them altogether.\n\n22\n00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.020\nSo, I feel like the best way to actually\n\n23\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.670\nunderstand what the blend tool does is\njust to go ahead and jump right into it.\n\n24\n00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.747\nSo, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and grab a couple shapes.\n\n25\n00:01:10.747 --> 00:01:13.960\nAnd I'm gonna grab them\ninto different colors here.\n\n26\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.000\nSo what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go\nahead and grab, let's do some stars.\n\n27\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.785\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, wow.\n\n28\n00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:20.514\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:22.530\n&gt;&gt; You saw me bypass that rectangle.\n\n30\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.382\nI thought about it, I kinda hovered,\nand then I was like nope, no,\n\n31\n00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:26.495\nwe're doing stars, so.\n\n32\n00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:29.822\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you're not watching in order you're\n\n33\n00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:30.595\nlike, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:31.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n35\n00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.190\nthis is a huge departure\nfrom your rectangle.\n\n36\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.721\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n37\n00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:38.536\nI pretty much stick with the rectangles.\n\n38\n00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:40.071\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:41.254\n&gt;&gt; So, while we're getting,\n\n40\n00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:42.643\nwe're gonna jump into the star.\n\n41\n00:01:42.643 --> 00:01:44.843\nSo I'm gonna grab that star.\n\n42\n00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:49.000\nI'm gonna duplicate that over,\nmaybe make a smaller star.\n\n43\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.810\nMaybe I will make this one blue.\n\n44\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.040\nSo, I'm gonna do something that\nlooks a little bit like that.\n\n45\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.220\nI've got my star and my star.\n\n46\n00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.130\nNow, what I wanna do is I wanna\nkinda blend these two together.\n\n47\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.830\nSo, I'm gonna select both stars.\n\n48\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.850\nNow, there are multiple different\nmethods for doing this.\n\n49\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.700\nAnd I'll kind of walk you\nthrough the different ones.\n\n50\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.810\nBut we're just gonna start\nwith our object menu.\n\n51\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.240\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect both of these.\n\n52\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.450\nI'm gonna go to my Object menu.\n\n53\n00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.845\nThen I'm gonna go down to Blend.\n\n54\n00:02:14.845 --> 00:02:19.000\nAnd then I can either choose just Make or\nI can go to my Blend Options first.\n\n55\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.760\nSo if I just go to Blend and\nthen Make, it's gonna go ahead and\n\n56\n00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.930\nbasically decide what's gonna happen for\nme.\n\n57\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.320\nSo I get this kind of asteroid\nshooting out effect, which is cool.\n\n58\n00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.620\nBut I can also adjust\nhow I want that to look.\n\n59\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.280\nSo I can go to Object, Blend, and\nthen I can go to Blend Options.\n\n60\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.040\nAnd I can choose, okay,\nI don't want a Smooth Color.\n\n61\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.870\nSmooth Color's the default\nthat that just chose for me.\n\n62\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.880\nBut I want maybe Specified Steps.\n\n63\n00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.640\nSo you can see it went ahead and\n\n64\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.360\ntook the number of steps that it's\nactually using for smooth colors.\n\n65\n00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.341\nTechnically, I have 254\nstars in between here.\n\n66\n00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:55.610\nMaybe I wanna go ahead and\nset that back down to something like 10.\n\n67\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.660\nSo I can go ahead and do that, hit OK.\n\n68\n00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.060\nAnd you can start to see how these\nstars are kind of moving and\n\n69\n00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.910\nthe way that the colors are changing.\n\n70\n00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.533\nSo right here, all we're really looking\nat is the difference between the size and\n\n71\n00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:08.119\nthe colors.\n\n72\n00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:10.401\nSo the stars are getting\na little bit smaller, and\n\n73\n00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.260\nthen the actual color is changing here.\n\n74\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.870\nSo what you will notice,\n\n75\n00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.780\nI have this spine, I'm pointing\non my screen like you can see.\n\n76\n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.580\nI have this spine here, that's kind\nof where the way my blend tool works.\n\n77\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.560\nYou always have that spine or at least,\nuntil we do some other tricks later,\n\n78\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.290\nyou're always gonna have that\nspine connecting these things.\n\n79\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.140\nAnd what's nice about that spine\nis that makes it editable.\n\n80\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.610\nSo I can't necessarily edit\nthe points in between but\n\n81\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.660\nI can edit the two end points\nthat I had originally.\n\n82\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.800\nSo maybe I wanna double-click\non this blue star,\n\n83\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.410\nmaybe make that a little bit smaller.\n\n84\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.530\nAnd I can go ahead and do that,\n\n85\n00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.840\nand maybe change the color, if you\nwanna see kind of what that looks like.\n\n86\n00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.087\nAnd I can go ahead and just again\ndouble-click to get out of isolation mode\n\n87\n00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:57.153\nto see what that effect looks like.\n\n88\n00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.274\n&gt;&gt; Well that,\nwhen you went to the double-click,\n\n89\n00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:01.770\nI was like,\nI always went to the white arrow.\n\n90\n00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.700\n&gt;&gt; I would go to the white arrow to\nselect that piece or that point on that.\n\n91\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.938\nAnd that's actually a little easier with\nthe double-click of the black arrow.\n\n92\n00:04:09.938 --> 00:04:16.847\nCuz you wanted to get into the object\nitself, that yellow smaller star.\n\n93\n00:04:16.847 --> 00:04:20.406\nBut you could use the white too, I think,\n\n94\n00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:25.403\nyou just have to watch that I\nwant that whole piece, yeah.\n\n95\n00:04:25.403 --> 00:04:28.188\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,\nnever would have thought about that.\n\n96\n00:04:28.188 --> 00:04:31.200\nEverybody has their own\ndifferent ways of doing things.\n\n97\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.970\nAnd it's funny cuz the white arrow tool\nnever would have even occurred to me.\n\n98\n00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.090\nBut in some ways, I actually think\nthe white arrow area tool's easier.\n\n99\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.112\nSo we both like each other's methods here.\n\n100\n00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:39.783\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n101\n00:04:39.783 --> 00:04:42.621\nyou can choose whatever\ndifferent option you want.\n\n102\n00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:46.790\nAnd you're not even necessarily\nrestricted to two of the same shape.\n\n103\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.300\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna set up another blend for you.\n\n104\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.240\nBut then I'm also gonna choose to\ndo it not only different shapes,\n\n105\n00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.790\nbut I'm gonna show you a different\nmethod for our blend tool.\n\n106\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.600\nSo, what I wanna do here,\nI'm gonna choose a circle and a star.\n\n107\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.380\nI know,\nI'm really branching out of the rectangle.\n\n108\n00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.050\nSo I have a circle and a star,\nagain, for demonstrations purposes,\n\n109\n00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.190\nwe'll go ahead and\nchange the colors of that.\n\n110\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.460\nAnd then what I wanna do now is I\nwanna use my actual blend tool.\n\n111\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.580\nSo rather than using my Object menu,\nBlend, and Make, and all that,\n\n112\n00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.010\nI can actually use my Blend tool.\n\n113\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.970\nNow, I still have to save my\nblend options in my Object menu.\n\n114\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.110\nAnd blend options are something you can\nchoose either before you create a blend,\n\n115\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.420\nor something that you can edit or\nuse to edit after you create a blend.\n\n116\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.450\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n117\n00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.450\nCuz I had ten steps specified last time,\n\n118\n00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.080\nthat's kinda of the setting that it's\ngonna use again, and I'm fine with that.\n\n119\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.903\nSo what I'm gonna do, note, I don't\nactually have to have anything selected.\n\n120\n00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:46.040\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ngrab my Blend tool.\n\n121\n00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.370\nIt's right next to the Eyedropper tool.\n\n122\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.880\nIf you're ever somebody who\nworks in InDesign a lot,\n\n123\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.740\nit's also the hot key W,\nwhich is a very popular one in InDesign.\n\n124\n00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.250\nSo I'm constantly turning on my Blend\ntool on accident [LAUGH] in Illustrator,\n\n125\n00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.675\njust tidbit, fyi.\n\n126\n00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:06.210\nSo I tend to use this\none by picking the tool.\n\n127\n00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.830\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and grab that.\n\n128\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.750\nAnd then what I wanna do,\n\n129\n00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.820\nI just need to single-click on\neach object that I wanna blend.\n\n130\n00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.590\nSo I'm gonna single-click here and\nsingle-click here.\n\n131\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.110\nAnd we can go ahead and create that blend.\n\n132\n00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.240\nNow you see, it didn't actually pick\nup those last settings that I had,\n\n133\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.960\nwhich is fine.\n\n134\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.900\nI can go back into my blend option,\nso Object, Blend, Blend Options.\n\n135\n00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.510\nAnd I can go ahead and change that\nto specified steps here, again, or\n\n136\n00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.630\nreally, it just depends on what you want.\n\n137\n00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.548\nIf you want smooth color, that's great.\n\n138\n00:06:34.548 --> 00:06:36.070\nI'm gonna go ahead and set that to 10.\n\n139\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.850\nAnd you can start to see here,\n\n140\n00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.830\nwhen I separate that out,\nhow those actual shapes are changing.\n\n141\n00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.480\nSo you have that option there.\n\n142\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.010\nSomething that I use\nthe Blend tool a lot for,\n\n143\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.040\njust as a little tidbit, I use the Blend\ntool a lot to kind of create colors.\n\n144\n00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.490\nSo I'll use it to, and\nI've got a whole different theory on that,\n\n145\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.230\nwhich I won't get into,\nhow I actually use it to blend colors,\n\n146\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.730\nto then later create swatches out of,\nthings like that.\n\n147\n00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.810\nMaybe not necessarily something\nI would do with this.\n\n148\n00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.810\nThese just here tend to get\na little bit muddy in the middle.\n\n149\n00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.720\nBut if I did have some cool options\nthat came out of the middle\n\n150\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.250\nwhat I might wanna do is create\nsome swatches out of it.\n\n151\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.170\nSo what I will do, and\nyou don't necessarily have to do this or\n\n152\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.100\nhave to do this method, but I'm kind\nof just using that as an example of\n\n153\n00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.370\nwhy I would do the next step,\nis I'm gonna go ahead and expand this.\n\n154\n00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.390\nSo I want to get rid of this spine.\n\n155\n00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.670\nI want to create separate,\nindividual little stars or\n\n156\n00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.870\nkind of weird star-circle-y\nthings out of this.\n\n157\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.600\nRight now, you'll see, if I double-click,\nI can only access those two.\n\n158\n00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.019\nBut I wanna be able to access\nall the ones in-between it.\n\n159\n00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:49.610\nCuz I, in my personal case, I wanna\nbe able to create a swatch out of it.\n\n160\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.640\nSo, what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna go ahead and select this.\n\n161\n00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.538\nThen I'm gonna go to my Object menu.\n\n162\n00:07:54.538 --> 00:07:56.550\nYou have two different\nways that you can do this.\n\n163\n00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.030\nI can go to Object,\nBlend, and then Expand.\n\n164\n00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.650\nOr, I can go to Object, Expand.\n\n165\n00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.691\nIt doesn't matter, so Object, Blend,\nExpand, you go ahead and do that.\n\n166\n00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:09.990\nYou'll see what's happened,\nthis is on grouped.\n\n167\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.410\nBut I now have individual\nshapes that I can pull out.\n\n168\n00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.130\nAnd again, for my purposes,\nwhat I like to do if I go ahead and\n\n169\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.310\nUngroup this,\nI like to create swatches out of them.\n\n170\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.530\nI use blending my colors as a way\nof kind of creating new swatches.\n\n171\n00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.450\nAnd again, we've talked about so\nmany different methods for\n\n172\n00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.490\nfinding color, Recolor Artwork tool,\nthings like that that you can use.\n\n173\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.270\nBut I do like this option.\n\n174\n00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.720\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you could select all of those.\n\n175\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.270\nIf you wanted every single one\nof those ten colors as a swatch,\n\n176\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.490\nyou select them all.\n\n177\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.535\nAnd then add them as a group, and\nit will go ahead, yeah, make them all.\n\n178\n00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:47.230\nSo that's kinda nice if you\ndo have specific steps there.\n\n179\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.330\nAnd just to expand upon the Expand,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n180\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:56.330\nThat is a common command that you\nwill see in a couple different\n\n181\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.080\nplaces that we're going to do\nit in the Live Trace and stuff.\n\n182\n00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Expand is just what it was\n\n183\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.160\ndemonstrating, if it's like\nin a ten stepped Blend mode,\n\n184\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.470\nI'm expanding out into\nthe individual components.\n\n185\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.650\nBack in the Effects,\nwhere we did the Pucker and\n\n186\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.310\nBloat-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n187\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.790\n&gt;&gt; Where it was still a rectangle, but I\nwanted that kinda star-looking thing that\n\n188\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.350\ncame out it, and I wanted to be able\nto edit those individual points,\n\n189\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.580\nthat's another place where you\ncan use the Expand to say,\n\n190\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.930\nright there, I want this as\nan actual path expanded out.\n\n191\n00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.860\nAnd then it will take it and,\nperfect, expand appearance.\n\n192\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.100\nYep, and then we got that as\nan actual path that we can edit.\n\n193\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.406\nIt's no longer having\nthat as just an effect.\n\n194\n00:09:46.406 --> 00:09:48.968\nAnd, again,\nother places where Expand comes out,\n\n195\n00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:53.080\nI always teach it in the blend too,\nbecause especially with the steps part.\n\n196\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.030\nBecause I think it really exemplifies\nthe Expand command, so, yes.\n\n197\n00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes, lovely, Expand,\n\n198\n00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.580\nlike she said it, it's definitely\nsomething that you're gonna use a lot.\n\n199\n00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.820\nIt's always kinda one of those I don't\nreally know where to introduce it,\n\n200\n00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.320\ncuz it's used in so many different places.\n\n201\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.130\nBut you'll probably see it again if\nyou're watching all these episodes.\n\n202\n00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.830\nSo, I was just trying to fall\nalong with the Pucker and Bloat.\n\n203\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.430\nYou can see, okay,\nthere, I have that path.\n\n204\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.146\nThis one is the one that's expanded.\n\n205\n00:10:16.146 --> 00:10:18.520\nAnd I don't have that kind of box around.\n\n206\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.600\nSo I'll go ahead and delete those,\ncuz those don't have anything to do with\n\n207\n00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.650\nBlend, but\nsometimes you get off on a little tangent.\n\n208\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.420\nSo what we'll take here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and delete these,\n\n209\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.000\nI just wanted to show you that expand.\n\n210\n00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.820\nNow, something else that I wanna\npoint out with the blend is that you\n\n211\n00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.790\ncan blend more than two objects.\n\n212\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.957\nSo don't feel like you're\nlimited to just two.\n\n213\n00:10:36.957 --> 00:10:41.821\nSo something, a little fun, little way of\ndemonstrating this that I usually like to\n\n214\n00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:45.380\ndo and hopefully,\nI won't screw it up here.\n\n215\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.690\nIt's always my goal when I'm on live TV,\ndon't mess it up.\n\n216\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.865\nSo we'll take this.\n\n217\n00:10:50.865 --> 00:10:55.059\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ngive this a couple different color values.\n\n218\n00:10:55.059 --> 00:11:01.038\nI'll do something like that,\nmaybe, I'll do a yellow, yellow.\n\n219\n00:11:01.038 --> 00:11:02.300\n&gt;&gt; Yellow.\n\n220\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.497\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of course,\n\n221\n00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:08.751\nmaybe I'll end with the red or\nwe'll go to a darker one.\n\n222\n00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:13.322\nNot a big fan of the orange, I guess,\nas evidenced by my appearance here.\n\n223\n00:11:13.322 --> 00:11:15.109\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nI wanna set Object, Blend,\n\n224\n00:11:15.109 --> 00:11:16.460\nI'm gonna choose this Blend Options.\n\n225\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.290\nI wanna go ahead and make sure that\nI have Smooth Color turned on.\n\n226\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.700\nSo that looks good, I've got Smooth Color.\n\n227\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.728\nNow I'm gonna use my Blend tool.\n\n228\n00:11:24.728 --> 00:11:26.690\nAnd I wanna try and\nblend in a certain order.\n\n229\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.130\nSo your Blend tool will always\nfollow the order that you went.\n\n230\n00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.470\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n231\n00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:37.100\nselect this blue circle first, go down\nto the pink circle, up to the orange,\n\n232\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.720\ndown to the yellow, and\nover to that darker orange or that red.\n\n233\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.400\nAnd you can see how at\nthe end of this result,\n\n234\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.010\nyou almost have something that\nkinda looks like a logo, right?\n\n235\n00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.766\nOr, I feel like it could be a logo,\n\n236\n00:11:47.766 --> 00:11:50.640\ncuz people always wanna see\na practical use of this.\n\n237\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.190\nAnd I feel like with something like this,\nif you kind of do it right, this maybe not\n\n238\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.898\nperfect, like it's a little fat,\nit's a really wide W, things like that.\n\n239\n00:11:58.898 --> 00:12:03.165\nBut you could kinda see where if you\nhad a company, their letter was a W,\n\n240\n00:12:03.165 --> 00:12:07.596\nyou can kinda see how you would start\nto use this from a practical purpose.\n\n241\n00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:11.571\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go on, and if you needed\nto change how far out the W goes,\n\n242\n00:12:11.571 --> 00:12:16.448\nyou go in to change each one of those\nindividual circles and move them around,\n\n243\n00:12:16.448 --> 00:12:21.410\nand go through, yep, just like that,\nif I wanted to take it and change it.\n\n244\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:26.164\nAnd not to go too far off\nthe rabbit trail, the rabbit trail?\n\n245\n00:12:26.164 --> 00:12:26.707\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n246\n00:12:26.707 --> 00:12:31.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can take in the spine\nthat we were talking about.\n\n247\n00:12:31.013 --> 00:12:31.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n248\n00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.340\nYou can move those specific points.\n\n249\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.910\nYou can convert the points, remember,\ngoing from a straight, the curved?\n\n250\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.320\nYou can do all of that on those\nparticular points of the spine and\n\n251\n00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.200\nbe able to modify that if you wanted\nto go a little bit more crazy.\n\n252\n00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.630\n&gt;&gt; If you wanted to get really wild.\n\n253\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.330\nWell, we'll do something similar to that.\n\n254\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.280\nSo I'm gonna go back in my Object menu,\nand I go to Blend.\n\n255\n00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.730\nAnd what I wanna do, okay, first of all,\nyou can see how you can reverse spines,\n\n256\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.270\nif I kind of flip that around,\nsee how that all kind of flipped for me?\n\n257\n00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:04.120\nBut something else you can do that\nI'm gonna try here is I'm gonna try\n\n258\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.980\nreplacing my spine.\n\n259\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.146\nSo I'm gonna take a spiral, and\n\n260\n00:13:07.146 --> 00:13:12.376\nwhat I'm gonna do I'll select both of\nthese objects, go to Object, Blend.\n\n261\n00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:14.639\nIt's been a while since I've done this,\nso let's all just hope it works.\n\n262\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.181\nAll right, so, I was mentioning I was\na little worried there for a second.\n\n263\n00:13:21.181 --> 00:13:24.206\nWell, what I didn't expect to happen\nwas that Illustrator would entirely\n\n264\n00:13:24.206 --> 00:13:24.740\ncrash on us.\n\n265\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.950\nSo it was just too cool,\nbasically, is what we're saying.\n\n266\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.065\nSo what I've done is\nI've recreated that W.\n\n267\n00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:35.310\nAnd this is just a little\nfriendly tidbit to you.\n\n268\n00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.120\nMake sure that you back up your files,\nright?\n\n269\n00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.850\nSo you'll notice that my W colors\nhave changed a little bit.\n\n270\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.875\nBut through the magic of post-production,\n\n271\n00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:45.120\nwe're gonna kinda get back\nto where we were here.\n\n272\n00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.985\nSo I believe what I had going on,\nwas I had my W going on.\n\n273\n00:13:48.985 --> 00:13:52.290\nYou see my blends and I'm blending\nwith multiple different objects.\n\n274\n00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.121\nI got all those different\ncircles going on.\n\n275\n00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:58.140\nAnd then what I was getting ready to\ntalk about was replacing a spine.\n\n276\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.210\nSo I have that swirl going on, and\nthen when I go here, what I'm gonna do,\n\n277\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.490\nI'm gonna go to Object, Blend,\nand then Replace Spine.\n\n278\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.820\nNow, this is apparently where\nIllustrator's just like, mind-blown, and\n\n279\n00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.200\nwants to go ahead and crash on me.\n\n280\n00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.866\nBut you should be able to go Object,\nBlend, Replace Spine.\n\n281\n00:14:15.866 --> 00:14:20.859\nAnd you can see, what will happen is it\nwill translate that spine that we had\n\n282\n00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:23.011\nbefore that W into this spiral.\n\n283\n00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:26.693\nAnd kind of the cool thing,\nif I go here and I duplicate this, so\n\n284\n00:14:26.693 --> 00:14:31.002\nthat we can kinda show some other\nexamples, I can do this Object, Blend,\n\n285\n00:14:31.002 --> 00:14:32.895\nReplace Spine, make a spiral.\n\n286\n00:14:32.895 --> 00:14:35.620\nAnd then we can also create\nsome other spines too.\n\n287\n00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:41.830\n&gt;&gt; And this is one of those again,\nmy mouth is just going, ooh, no way!\n\n288\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.250\nIt's an option I never did.\n\n289\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.720\nI never thought to go ahead and\nuse that Replace Spine.\n\n290\n00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.060\nIt's probably always been there, too,\n\n291\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.057\ncuz I wanted to use the whole\nexcuse of like, that's new.\n\n292\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.051\nNo, I've just never done it,\nso another new, fun technique.\n\n293\n00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:58.178\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When it doubt,\n\n294\n00:14:58.178 --> 00:14:59.277\njust say it's a new thing.\n\n295\n00:14:59.277 --> 00:15:01.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's why you don't know, right?\n\n296\n00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:02.652\nSo yeah, I wanna go ahead and show you.\n\n297\n00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:06.459\nYou're not limited to just kind of\none of Illustrator's objects or\n\n298\n00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:07.740\nsomething like that.\n\n299\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.937\nI just took my paint brush and\nI just kinda painted this line.\n\n300\n00:15:09.937 --> 00:15:11.725\nYou guys know I'm all about the swirl.\n\n301\n00:15:11.725 --> 00:15:13.080\nAnd I'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n302\n00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.937\nSo I'm gonna go to Object,\nBlend, and Replace Spine, and\n\n303\n00:15:16.937 --> 00:15:20.348\nthen you see it'll go ahead and\nreplace that there.\n\n304\n00:15:20.348 --> 00:15:22.120\nAnd then all of these are still editable.\n\n305\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.581\nSo because we have that spine,\nwe have an expanded, what I can go here,\n\n306\n00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:26.691\nI can double-click.\n\n307\n00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:29.261\nMaybe I want that to be\na little bit smaller,\n\n308\n00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.909\ncan kind of make a little snake or\nsomething.\n\n309\n00:15:31.909 --> 00:15:34.728\nI don't know, world's most colorful snake.\n\n310\n00:15:34.728 --> 00:15:37.880\nAnd I can go here and\nI can make that a little bit larger.\n\n311\n00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.254\nThis actually might be a situation\nwhere my white arrow is gonna come\n\n312\n00:15:41.254 --> 00:15:43.632\nin a little bit better for,\nyeah, selection.\n\n313\n00:15:43.632 --> 00:15:45.766\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is where I would\nhave go to the white arrow first to\n\n314\n00:15:45.766 --> 00:15:46.404\nselect the shape.\n\n315\n00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.206\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Then go back to the black arrow and\n\n316\n00:15:48.206 --> 00:15:50.089\nthen make it bigger,\njust like at the Expand.\n\n317\n00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:53.022\nSo you're double-clicking into-\n&gt;&gt; I typically do, yeah.\n\n318\n00:15:53.022 --> 00:15:57.008\n&gt;&gt; End of the shape to get you there,\nmakes it a little easier than having to\n\n319\n00:15:57.008 --> 00:15:59.540\nswitch back and\nforth between the two tools.\n\n320\n00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.610\nSo that's why I was like, yeah,\ncuz I forgot that extra step in there.\n\n321\n00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:08.487\nBut with that white arrow tool, you could\nselect one of those individual points or\n\n322\n00:16:08.487 --> 00:16:13.169\nthat the middle point of the spine and\nthe circle, and move that or\n\n323\n00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:17.798\ndo the convert points to make it\nmore smoother or whatever, so.\n\n324\n00:16:17.798 --> 00:16:19.099\n&gt;&gt; You can go crazy.\n\n325\n00:16:19.099 --> 00:16:21.180\nYou've got all kinds of different options.\n\n326\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.384\nAnd I think the blend tools definitely\nyou want, play around with it,\n\n327\n00:16:24.384 --> 00:16:25.209\nhave a lot of fun.\n\n328\n00:16:25.209 --> 00:16:27.250\nWe made all these crazy things.\n\n329\n00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.670\nIf Illustrator crashes on you,\nno big deal,\n\n330\n00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.240\njust make sure you've saved your files.\n\n331\n00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.390\nLearn from my lesson here,\nfrom my mistake.\n\n332\n00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:38.460\nSo, hope you're enjoying it,\nkinda, again, play around with it,\n\n333\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.220\ndo all kinds of different crazy things,\nand just have fun with it.\n\n334\n00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.303\nYes, and\nalways have a tailor directing and\n\n335\n00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:45.848\ndoing all of your post-production videos,\nright?\n\n336\n00:16:45.848 --> 00:16:47.249\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, yes,\n\n337\n00:16:47.249 --> 00:16:50.273\nalways have someone doing\npost-production at all times.\n\n338\n00:16:50.273 --> 00:16:52.784\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, I wish I had that all the time.\n\n339\n00:16:52.784 --> 00:16:54.139\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just in life.\n\n340\n00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, let's redo that, and\n\n341\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.291\njust stitch them together, awesome.\n\n342\n00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:01.131\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; TV.\n\n343\n00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:03.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, that was super fun with Blend.\n\n344\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.420\nYes, there's lots of

too.\n\n347\n00:17:10.733 --> 00:17:14.690\nAnd so we're gonna do this,\nwe're gonna wrap it on up.\n\n348\n00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.400\nAnd signing off for CreativeProTV,\nI've been your host,

another\nexciting edition of Creativepro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.372\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and we're\ncontinuing on with Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n5\n00:00:20.372 --> 00:00:23.060\nAnd today,\nwe're gonna be talking about symbols.\n\n6\n00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.200\nYes, what is that?\n\n7\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.350\nWell, luckily we have Emily\nhere to tell us all about it.\n\n8\n00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.570\nThank you, Miss Ramsey,\nfor coming over here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.901\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\njust to explain what a symbol is, yes-\n\n10\n00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:32.990\n&gt;&gt; And then you can go.\n\n11\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.579\n&gt;&gt; No, you got a lot more to do.\n\n13\n00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.390\n&gt;&gt; I'm free for the day, okay [LAUGH].\n\n14\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.650\nNo, no, so symbols.\n\n15\n00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.480\nSymbols are actually pretty fun.\n\n16\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.755\nSymbols are basically illustrators\nversion of clip art which is\n\n17\n00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:46.820\npretty much how I describe it.\n\n18\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.180\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I've ever\ndescribed it that way.\n\n19\n00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.654\nThat's perfect\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n20\n00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:55.826\n[LAUGH] it's like fancier clip art\nbasically, it's a little bit nicer.\n\n21\n00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:59.509\nSo, it's basically this\npremade kind of graphics and\n\n22\n00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:04.646\nthings that you can use in illustrator\nto make your life a little bit easier.\n\n23\n00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:07.954\nWe're gonna see how we can use\nthe ones that are already pre-made,\n\n24\n00:01:07.954 --> 00:01:09.880\nthat kind of pre-done clip art for us.\n\n25\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.260\nNow, since we're working\nin Illustrator and\n\n26\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.820\nwe can actually make these\nthings an illustrator.\n\n27\n00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.214\nObviously, we are also gonna see\nhow we can create our own symbols.\n\n28\n00:01:18.214 --> 00:01:19.485\nThat's gonna be an option.\n\n29\n00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:22.887\nThere are some vulnerable tools like the\nsymbol sprayer that go along with it and\n\n30\n00:01:22.887 --> 00:01:24.410\njust couple of other little tips and\n\n31\n00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.510\ntricks, that I'm gonna\nshow you along the way.\n\n32\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.190\nLet's go ahead and\nhop into our Symbols panel.\n\n33\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.700\nWhen we open up our Symbol's panel,\n\n34\n00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.900\nif you don't have it you should\nnow go to your windows menu.\n\n35\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.484\nGo all the way down to Symbols,\nand go ahead and grab that now.\n\n36\n00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:42.012\nYou should see a couple just by default,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:42.012 --> 00:01:43.650\njust start out by picking one.\n\n38\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.706\nThe way that these work,\nis simply just to drag and drop.\n\n39\n00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:50.553\nSo if I see one that I like and I say\nokay, I wanna go ahead and use that orange\n\n40\n00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:54.670\ncircle, all I need to do is drag and\ndrop it onto my artboard, it's that easy.\n\n41\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.280\nSo I can go ahead and\ntake this to be, yep.\n\n42\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.350\nLike that, drag and\ndrop it into my art board.\n\n43\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.330\nYou may be thinking, okay,\nthat's really small.\n\n44\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.870\nThat's not really helping me.\n\n45\n00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.890\nYou can resize this.\n\n46\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.680\nSo I can go ahead.\n\n47\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980\nI'm gonna hold down my Shift key,\njust cuz this is a circle and\n\n48\n00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.870\nI wanna keep the proportions right.\n\n49\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.290\nAnd I can go ahead and\nmake that a little bit larger.\n\n50\n00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.480\nI can drag and drop another one.\n\n51\n00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.240\nMaybe I want this little grunge splatter,\nthings like that.\n\n52\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.740\nI can duplicate it, or I can use two.\n\n53\n00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.920\nThings like that, you can keep going and\n\n54\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.320\nobviously you're not limited\nto just these six or five.\n\n55\n00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.100\nI'm not even gonna try and\ncount right now.\n\n56\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.030\nIt's too early in the morning to try and\ncount.\n\n57\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.880\nWe have our symbol library,\n\n58\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.200\nso like we have brush libraries Swatch\nlibraries and other things like that.\n\n59\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.550\nWe have symbol libraries with all\nkinds of options that we can use.\n\n60\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.550\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\ngrab this symbol libraries menu.\n\n61\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.160\nAnd you can see my cursor\nimmediately goes to mad science,\n\n62\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.676\nthat's my personal, [LAUGH] favorite.\n\n63\n00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:53.256\nBut you can see how you can kinda\nscroll through and okay, charts.\n\n64\n00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.527\nYou can see how that would\nbe helpful communication.\n\n65\n00:02:56.527 --> 00:02:59.340\nThat could be kind of interesting for\nyou to use.\n\n66\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.125\nI obviously,\n\n67\n00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:04.190\nhave to go the mad science route\nbecause that's just what I'm all about.\n\n68\n00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.301\nI love a good beaker so,\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna go ahead and drag and\n\n69\n00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:08.772\ndrop that onto my art board.\n\n70\n00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:10.280\nAnd you can see what\nthat looks like there.\n\n71\n00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.850\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and drag and\n\n72\n00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.820\ndrop a couple of these here because\nI wanna point out something.\n\n73\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.860\nSo with your symbols, technically,\n\n74\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.950\nyour symbols are always\ntied to the symbol source.\n\n75\n00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.930\nAnd we basically just have\ninstances of each symbol.\n\n76\n00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.521\nWhat I'm saying, really,\nor what I'm getting at,\n\n77\n00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:30.144\nis that I can edit these symbols.\n\n78\n00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:30.757\nWhat I'm gonna do?\n\n79\n00:03:30.757 --> 00:03:35.470\nI'm actually going to go on my Symbols\npanel and say, you know what, I'm all\n\n80\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.276\nabout the mad science, but I really want\nwhatever is foaming out of my beaker.\n\n81\n00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:42.610\nFoaming, bubbling, chemistry.\n\n82\n00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll go with foamy.\n\n83\n00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:45.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n84\n00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:46.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It was foamy.\n\n85\n00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Whatever's happening in there, I want\nit to be blue or something like that.\n\n86\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.080\nSo I'm gonna double click\nactually on this symbol,\n\n87\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.650\nit's called flask if you cover over it.\n\n88\n00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.736\nI'm gonna call it a beaker\ncuz it sounds more fun.\n\n89\n00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:02.373\nIf I double click on that when I hover\nover it you can see I get into the kinda\n\n90\n00:04:02.373 --> 00:04:03.220\nthis edit mode.\n\n91\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.520\nIt almost exist to kinda like\nan isolation mode if you will.\n\n92\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.940\nIt's kinda similar to that.\n\n93\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.150\nNot quite the same thing but\nthat's kinda what it looks like.\n\n94\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.810\nAnd now, here I can go in and edit this.\n\n95\n00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.100\nMaybe I wanna edit these\nbubbles up a little bit.\n\n96\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.330\nI can go ahead and grab that.\n\n97\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.520\nThat's my, my form if you we will.\n\n98\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.460\nTechnically they were using a gradient.\n\n99\n00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.077\nI'm not gonna spend the time to\ncreate a gradient this morning but\n\n100\n00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:28.921\nI can go here and say, okay,\nI want that to be blue.\n\n101\n00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:31.497\nAnd now, I wanna go head,\nI double clicked a little bit too fast but\n\n102\n00:04:31.497 --> 00:04:33.928\nyou can see when I kind of\ndouble clicked out of there.\n\n103\n00:04:33.928 --> 00:04:37.000\nSo I click double clicked in my\nSymbols panel to get into that.\n\n104\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.070\nJust double clicked kind off to\nthe side over here to get out of it.\n\n105\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.290\nAnd now, all of the beakers\non my art board have changed.\n\n106\n00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.320\nSo, we have those kind of\ninstances of each symbol.\n\n107\n00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.780\nThey're all kind of tied together.\n\n108\n00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can also double click on\none of the instances on the art board.\n\n109\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.860\nAnd it's gonna take you to the same place.\n\n110\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.390\nThe only difference is it's going to give\nyou that little warning right there.\n\n111\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.500\nSo don't think that you have to\nonly go to the Symbols panels.\n\n112\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.940\nYou can right do it from the artboard.\n\n113\n00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.842\nBut it is nice that it does give\nus that little pop up right there.\n\n114\n00:05:06.842 --> 00:05:11.224\nIt says, hey, you're gonna be editing all\nthe instances do you wanna continue and\n\n115\n00:05:11.224 --> 00:05:13.927\nthat's where I don't okay,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n116\n00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:16.575\nBut it senses all of the instances and\n\n117\n00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:21.872\ntries to give you a little bit of a\nheads-up is like, this is kind of all for\n\n118\n00:05:21.872 --> 00:05:25.850\none, one for all, yay, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Team spirit, right?\n\n119\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.640\nIt's what we're going with, yeah.\n\n120\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.080\nSo yeah, it's exactly right.\n\n121\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.830\nAnd it is nice that it gives\nyou that little warning there.\n\n122\n00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.420\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and hit Cancel\ncuz I wanted to show you something else.\n\n123\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.330\nNow let's say for instance, I wanted\nthe center beaker to stay the same.\n\n124\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.910\nI just wanted to make sure that if I\nedit it an instance of my symbol that\n\n125\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.500\nthis would not move.\n\n126\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.250\nSo what I need to do is, I need to\nactually break the link to this symbol.\n\n127\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.980\nSo if you're kind of familiar\nwith graphic styles,\n\n128\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.720\nthis is kind of a similar\nconcept in breaking that link.\n\n129\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and select the one\nthat I want to be broken, if you will.\n\n130\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.970\nAnd I'm gonna go into my Symbols panel.\n\n131\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.380\nAnd you see how you get that little\nchain with the slash through it?\n\n132\n00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.090\nThat's just gonna be our sign for\nbreaking a link to a symbol.\n\n133\n00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.247\nSo if I go ahead and\nselect that and Vonne.\n\n134\n00:06:09.247 --> 00:06:12.125\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say,\nI also saw it up on the control panel.\n\n135\n00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:15.975\n[CROSSTALK] There's a button\nup there that says break link.\n\n136\n00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:18.820\nSo multiple places, the same thing.\n\n137\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.203\nJust kind of pointing out that it says\nbreak link up there, can I click that?\n\n138\n00:06:22.203 --> 00:06:25.169\nYeah, you can do that too, same thing.\n\n139\n00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.301\n&gt;&gt; Everybody has their own different way.\n\n140\n00:06:27.301 --> 00:06:29.510\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nAs always, [LAUGH] It's just funny.\n\n141\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.196\nIllustrator's like that.\n\n142\n00:06:30.196 --> 00:06:33.669\nSo, why you can do either way if you\nwanna go ahead and break that link.\n\n143\n00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.793\nNow, what you see doesn't\nreally look any different,\n\n144\n00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:41.125\nI think I see a different path outline\nkind of like it's on a different layer.\n\n145\n00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.930\nI think maybe they did go ahead and\nmove it to a different layer.\n\n146\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.720\nI don't know, nope just outlined\ndifferently with that path.\n\n147\n00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.849\nBut you can see it's\ndesignated off on its own now.\n\n148\n00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:53.579\nAnd what will happen if I go back to my\nSymbols panel, if I either double-click\n\n149\n00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:57.140\non this symbol or double-click on\nthe symbol in my Symbols panel.\n\n150\n00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.670\nAnd now, go ahead and update this.\n\n151\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.680\nLike maybe I want these\nbubbles to be pink.\n\n152\n00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.730\nYou'll see what will happen if I\njust kinda double click out it,\n\n153\n00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.990\nthat one with the broken\nlink is not going to change.\n\n154\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.760\nSo that will always stay the same,\nbecause I've broken that.\n\n155\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.920\nIt's now basically just acting as\nany other graphic on your art board.\n\n156\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.640\nIt's like something that you created.\n\n157\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.940\nIt's not at all tied with\nthe Symbols panel like these are.\n\n158\n00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.440\nNow, there are some other kinda cool\nthings that you can do with your symbols.\n\n159\n00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.697\nOne of my personal favorites\nis the Symbol Sprayer tool,\n\n160\n00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.335\n[LAUGH] it's just fun to say.\n\n161\n00:07:30.335 --> 00:07:32.273\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, it does get very fun,\n\n162\n00:07:32.273 --> 00:07:36.290\ncuz you're gonna be,\nwell spraying a bunch of symbols.\n\n163\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.145\nAnd not just that, there's all those other\ntools that come along with, we can make\n\n164\n00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:43.909\nthem bigger, make them smaller, and I love\nthis lesson too, so [LAUGH] well see.\n\n165\n00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:47.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right so\nwhat I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n166\n00:07:47.756 --> 00:07:50.100\nselect a symbol that I want to spray.\n\n167\n00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.649\nKind of think about it like a paint can,\nor something like that.\n\n168\n00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:57.492\nI'm gonna pick the flower, cuz I feel\nlike just make a field of flowers here.\n\n169\n00:07:57.492 --> 00:08:00.360\nAnd then, I'm gonna go ahead and\ngrab my symbol sprayer tool.\n\n170\n00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.870\nIt's right underneath the eye dropper and\n\n171\n00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.470\nit's the one that basically\nlooks like a paint can.\n\n172\n00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.200\nAnd what I can do once I've selected\nthe symbol that I want to spray,\n\n173\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.800\nI can go ahead and grab that.\n\n174\n00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.835\nNow first of all, before you get started,\ncouple of different options.\n\n175\n00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:17.560\nYou'll see that, that kind of diameter\naround my little paint can looks really\n\n176\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.650\nlarge?\n\n177\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.210\nI can increase or decrease the size\nof that using the right and\n\n178\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.910\nleft bracket keys on my keyboard.\n\n179\n00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.180\nSo maybe that looks a little bit big.\n\n180\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.590\nI wanna go ahead and decrease that.\n\n181\n00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.220\nSo I'm just gonna hit that left\nbracket key on my keyboard.\n\n182\n00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.620\nGo ahead and do that.\n\n183\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.451\nAnd then it's kind of a click,\nhold, and drag to actually spray.\n\n184\n00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:37.050\nThink about it like spraying a paint can.\n\n185\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.912\nI need to hold that button down,\nor hold that top down-\n\n186\n00:08:40.912 --> 00:08:41.544\n&gt;&gt; That the-\n\n187\n00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:42.105\n&gt;&gt; I use spray\n\n188\n00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:43.164\npaint a lot-\n&gt;&gt; The nozzle?\n\n189\n00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:45.367\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nozzle, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nozzle, yeah,\n\n190\n00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:49.660\nthe button-y thing with\nthe arrow that goes this way.\n\n191\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.287\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, I'm not too crafty.\n\n192\n00:08:52.287 --> 00:08:53.672\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're gonna\n\n193\n00:08:53.672 --> 00:08:55.560\nhold that down as you're spraying.\n\n194\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.820\nIt's kind of the same approach here.\n\n195\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.490\nSo I'm gonna click hold and drag my mouse.\n\n196\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.350\nAnd just kind of spray all along my\nartboard and what you'll see is I get\n\n197\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:09.350\nthat fun little pattern of my daisies,\nI think this is what it's called them.\n\n198\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.935\nI'm also not very good with gardening,\nso maybe Illustrator is really\n\n199\n00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:16.941\nwhat I need to kind of stick with, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can kill a cactus.\n\n200\n00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:21.690\nSo I'm right there with you, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Whatever it is, a flower.\n\n201\n00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.040\nWe're just gonna go broad here.\n\n202\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.719\nSo what we can see, okay well,\nI can go ahead and spray there.\n\n203\n00:09:26.719 --> 00:09:30.022\nAnd you'll notice if I kind of hover\nover one area longer than the other,\n\n204\n00:09:30.022 --> 00:09:31.104\nI get a little bit more,\n\n205\n00:09:31.104 --> 00:09:34.990\nif I kind of quickly bypass it, then it's\ngonna be a little bit more spread out.\n\n206\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.958\n&gt;&gt; One small little tip that's\ntripped me up before is right now,\n\n207\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.443\nyou can see that once you're using\nthe spray can with the Symbol Sprayer.\n\n208\n00:09:41.443 --> 00:09:44.215\nYou're spraying, going crazy and\nthen you let go,\n\n209\n00:09:44.215 --> 00:09:46.547\nnotice it's like- it's selected still.\n\n210\n00:09:46.547 --> 00:09:49.179\nAnd up in the left it\nsays it's a symbol set.\n\n211\n00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:52.899\nSo if you keep it selected and\nit keeps spraying,\n\n212\n00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:56.750\nit's gonna add to that single symbol set.\n\n213\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.900\nIf you click off and go somewhere else and\nspray somewhere else,\n\n214\n00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.360\nthen it becomes like a separate set.\n\n215\n00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.402\nSo it doesn't always meshed together if\nyou wanna say and have one big symbol set.\n\n216\n00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:10.350\nIt's just something to look for.\n\n217\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.530\nRight now it's all one but\njust keep that in mind in case,\n\n218\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.910\nwhy isn't it changing this\none versus the other?\n\n219\n00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.720\nIt becomes a different entity.\n\n220\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n221\n00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.490\nThat's a great point.\n\n222\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.440\nSo I'm just gonna kinda\nkeep spraying away here.\n\n223\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.840\nAnd now what happens if I\nkinda wanna go ahead and\n\n224\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.870\nget a little more fancy with this, right?\n\n225\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.300\nI wanna go ahead and edit it.\n\n226\n00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.400\nYou'll notice if you click and\nhold on your symbol sprayer tool,\n\n227\n00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.580\nyou have a lot of other things\nthat kinda go along with it.\n\n228\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.640\nSo if I go down maybe to\nthe symbol Shifter tool.\n\n229\n00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.100\nWe'll start with that one.\n\n230\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.010\nAnd I kinda click and hold on this.\n\n231\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.770\nYou'll see what it does is it\nkinda moves them around for me.\n\n232\n00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.583\nSo you can use that as a way of\nbasically editing what you have.\n\n233\n00:10:52.583 --> 00:10:54.951\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm over here doing this.\n\n234\n00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:57.431\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pushing it around and\n\n235\n00:10:57.431 --> 00:10:59.083\nmove it over this way.\n\n236\n00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:01.460\nLike a strong breeze, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n237\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you spray it in\na circle or some type of pattern.\n\n238\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.140\nYou're like, I just need to\nkinda just do this, [LAUGH].\n\n239\n00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.340\nI can't do anything else but\n\n240\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.530\nmove my hands around, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.810\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, it does shift it around.\n\n242\n00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.763\nYou can see the little arrows kinda\ngo back in and kinda move there or\n\n243\n00:11:17.763 --> 00:11:18.540\nright there\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n244\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.705\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I like that, [LAUGH]\n\n245\n00:11:20.705 --> 00:11:22.436\n&gt;&gt; Any a kinda point you where you\n\n246\n00:11:22.436 --> 00:11:23.063\nwanna go.\n\n247\n00:11:23.063 --> 00:11:26.179\nAnd I think if you wanna go backwards,\nyou can hold down your ALT key or no,\n\n248\n00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:29.316\nnot with this one it doesn't really\nseem to make too much of a difference.\n\n249\n00:11:29.316 --> 00:11:33.395\nBut some of them like you'll see I think\nif we go to our symbols scruncher tool\n\n250\n00:11:33.395 --> 00:11:36.290\nwhich is gonna make everything\na little bit smaller.\n\n251\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.215\nHolding down our Alt or\nOption key would do it the other way.\n\n252\n00:11:39.215 --> 00:11:42.828\nWow, it’s like all my flowers\ngot all crazy far apart.\n\n253\n00:11:42.828 --> 00:11:45.536\nSo just be aware that that's\nanother little keyboard shortcut as\n\n254\n00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:46.283\nI'm doing this.\n\n255\n00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:51.045\nLook like, okay, if I do this one way\nsometimes holding down your option\n\n256\n00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:53.090\nkey will take it the other way.\n\n257\n00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.850\nSo now my flowers have\njust blown apart there,\n\n258\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.790\nthe strong breeze has shifted basically,\n[LAUGH] is what we're saying.\n\n259\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.950\nSo you can kinda go through each of these,\nmaybe I wanna go to the Symbol Sizer tool,\n\n260\n00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.100\nit's like well I can make that\nreally big if I click on that.\n\n261\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.720\nLikewise, I think if I hold down my Alt or\n\n262\n00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.290\nOption key that'll make that a little\nbit smaller, that's a better I think,\n\n263\n00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.710\nmore visible example of that Alt or\nOption key that you have there.\n\n264\n00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.223\nAnd you can kinda just\nchange the appearance of it.\n\n265\n00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:25.680\nOne of my personal favorites\nis the Symbol Stainer tool.\n\n266\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.530\nSo the Symbol Stainer tool is going\nto pick up the last fill color\n\n267\n00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.600\nthat you used in illustrator and\nit's gonna set kind of a stain on that.\n\n268\n00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.980\nNaturally, of course,\n\n269\n00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.529\nmy last filler color was pink because that\njust seems to be the way that I roll here.\n\n270\n00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:44.320\nSo you can see it's adding like\nan additional stain to your symbols.\n\n271\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.178\n&gt;&gt; And you can go up in the fill right\nthere on the control panel and if you\n\n272\n00:12:48.178 --> 00:12:52.529\nwanted to stain these blue you could go\nahead and change that color up there.\n\n273\n00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:57.642\nAnd that becomes the color of the stainer\nand now you can see it's gonna go.\n\n274\n00:12:57.642 --> 00:12:59.870\nI love this one too.\n\n275\n00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.620\nMe and my rainbows and\nso I'll go ahead and\n\n276\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.770\nmake all sorts of rainbow\nflowers all over there.\n\n277\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:09.153\nAnd the more you hold down and\nthe more it stains it or click, click,\n\n278\n00:13:09.153 --> 00:13:14.166\nclick, and I believe the Alt key\non this one removes the stain.\n\n279\n00:13:14.166 --> 00:13:14.876\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n280\n00:13:14.876 --> 00:13:18.561\n&gt;&gt; Decreases the stain of whatever\ncolor that you're applying, so\n\n281\n00:13:18.561 --> 00:13:20.045\nthat's always a fun one.\n\n282\n00:13:20.045 --> 00:13:20.580\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n\n283\n00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.262\nThat was nice when you can make\nsomething that's already rainbow-y and\n\n284\n00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:27.774\nridiculous like a bunch of flowers\neverywhere even more so, right?\n\n285\n00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:30.037\nSo yeah, this is definitely one, I think,\n\n286\n00:13:30.037 --> 00:13:32.802\nto play around with kind to\nsee what each of them does.\n\n287\n00:13:32.802 --> 00:13:35.479\nIn your own right, make sure that\nyou kinda look at that Alt or\n\n288\n00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:39.100\nOption key option if something's going one\nway and you want it to go the other way,\n\n289\n00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.680\nand you can kinda think\nabout what it looks like.\n\n290\n00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI've always used this just for fun but\n\n291\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.800\nI have used this in a real world\nsetting if you wanna say to make\n\n292\n00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.240\nalmost like a textured background for\na flyer that I was doing.\n\n293\n00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.934\nAnd I don't wanna have this look and\nI was thinking, I was trying all of these\n\n294\n00:13:56.934 --> 00:14:00.428\ndifferent techniques, and\nI'm like, wait, the Symbol Sprayer.\n\n295\n00:14:00.428 --> 00:14:02.537\nAnd the symbol I had was\njust like really basic,\n\n296\n00:14:02.537 --> 00:14:05.672\nI think it was like a little swirl or\nsomething like that, swirl.\n\n297\n00:14:05.672 --> 00:14:06.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n298\n00:14:06.855 --> 00:14:10.409\n&gt;&gt; And then you kind of spray it around\nand then use like the shifter and\n\n299\n00:14:10.409 --> 00:14:11.184\nthe stainer.\n\n300\n00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:14.680\nAnd then, I took the whole set and\nlike reduced the opacity on it.\n\n301\n00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.132\nIt just made this kind of nice\nlike fluffy background for\n\n302\n00:14:19.132 --> 00:14:22.210\nI think it was like a fair of some sort.\n\n303\n00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.620\nLike a street fair that was or\ncrafts or something.\n\n304\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.250\nIt just kinda lended itself to it.\n\n305\n00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.810\nSo just in case you want like a real\nwarm application it can be done.\n\n306\n00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I did.\n\n307\n00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.165\n&gt;&gt; It's not all just flowers in the field.\n\n308\n00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:38.480\n[LAUGH] Yeah, probably not something\nyou're gonna use all the time quite\n\n309\n00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.820\nfrankly, but I definitely think\nespecially in the case of backgrounds,\n\n310\n00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.670\nthat's a great example of\nwhen you may use this.\n\n311\n00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:46.722\nNow, we're using here all\nof their preset examples.\n\n312\n00:14:46.722 --> 00:14:50.290\nI wanna go back into just our symbols\npanel real quick just to show you that you\n\n313\n00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.620\ncan actually create your own.\n\n314\n00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:56.602\nSo if there is a graphic that you're\ngonna be reusing a lot, you can go in and\n\n315\n00:14:56.602 --> 00:15:00.018\njust make a graphic like\nyou would in Illustrator.\n\n316\n00:15:00.018 --> 00:15:01.809\nLike I can take a circle.\n\n317\n00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:04.000\nThis is not gonna be pretty,\nI can assure you.\n\n318\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.020\nBut I can take this.\n\n319\n00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.390\nMaybe I'll do something crazy\ngo into my pathfinder panel.\n\n320\n00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.020\nKinda punch that out.\n\n321\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.779\nDo something that looks like that.\n\n322\n00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:14.937\nI don't know.\n\n323\n00:15:14.937 --> 00:15:19.458\nAnd I can go into my Symbols Panel, same\nthing I am gonna click hold and drag that\n\n324\n00:15:19.458 --> 00:15:23.998\nin to my Symbols Panel, and that's\nactually gonna create a new symbol for me.\n\n325\n00:15:23.998 --> 00:15:27.984\nNow we can go ahead and give it a name,\nskip past that stuff for a second,\n\n326\n00:15:27.984 --> 00:15:29.120\ngo ahead and hit OK.\n\n327\n00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.832\nAnd now click hold and drive that out,\nI've got intenses my symbol,\n\n328\n00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:35.535\nso it's now acting tied\nto that Symbol's Panel.\n\n329\n00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:37.690\n&gt;&gt; I have done that a lot\nwith either a logo,\n\n330\n00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:42.510\nor some type of thing that I created that\nI need to have repeated a lot of times.\n\n331\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.570\nAnd especially that,\ngoing back to the source and changing it,\n\n332\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.715\nthat has really helped me-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n333\n00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:51.373\n&gt;&gt; And it was one of those where I had\nto think, I did it one way, and I was,\n\n334\n00:15:51.373 --> 00:15:55.341\nif I would have just made this a symbol,\nI could have just changed those all,\n\n335\n00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:56.210\njust like that.\n\n336\n00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.101\nAnd I was, [SOUND], so\n\n337\n00:15:58.101 --> 00:16:03.581\nit takes a while to get you kind\nof in the symbol thinking mode.\n\n338\n00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:06.567\nBut yeah like reasonable assets almost.\n\n339\n00:16:06.567 --> 00:16:10.800\nAlmost kind of like we were talking about\nthe library in this sense, the CC library.\n\n340\n00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.660\nIt works on the same\npremise that goes there.\n\n341\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.900\nAnd the only other thing\nI would suggest or\n\n342\n00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.230\njust kind of as a tip,\nwe keep dragging it out of the library.\n\n343\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.640\nIf you just copy and paste,\nI think you might have said that.\n\n344\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.880\nIf you just copied and paste that to\nmultiple places, it's still a symbol.\n\n345\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.350\nIt's still an instance of a symbol.\n\n346\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:33.380\nYou don't always have to drag it out of\nthe library to make it be on the page.\n\n347\n00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.110\nSo yeah, exactly,\njust like what you just did.\n\n348\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.543\nI did that for one project and\nI was like why didn't I do this before.\n\n349\n00:16:39.543 --> 00:16:41.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's so much easier.\n\n350\n00:16:41.492 --> 00:16:42.970\n&gt;&gt; It saves so much time.\n\n351\n00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.760\nAnd I think a logo is a great example.\n\n352\n00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.260\nI have another, you may have seen\nkinda poking off to the side.\n\n353\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.770\nJust kind of a real world\nexample of when I may use this.\n\n354\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:55.620\nNow I sometimes for projects and things\nlike that make these little ribbon things.\n\n355\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.270\nWhat I'm gonna do here\nis make this a symbol.\n\n356\n00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.510\nBut I wanna show you\na couple things with this.\n\n357\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.640\nI'm gonna click, hold and\ndrag this into my symbols panel.\n\n358\n00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.240\nNow, I may get a warning here, something\nabout how I haven't expanded this,\n\n359\n00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.270\nbut we'll just bypass that.\n\n360\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.400\nAnd I just gonna go ahead and hit OK.\n\n361\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.060\nI'm gonna go ahead and make it, okay.\n\n362\n00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.428\nEnvelope, just ignore that.\n\n363\n00:17:13.428 --> 00:17:16.100\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you made that with\nthe envelope distort tool.\n\n364\n00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.520\n&gt;&gt; I made it with the envelope distort,\nyes.\n\n365\n00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.090\n&gt;&gt; We have an episode on that too so\nit's fine.\n\n366\n00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:22.662\n&gt;&gt; You'll probably see this again.\n\n367\n00:17:22.662 --> 00:17:26.550\n[LAUGH] Alright, so what I've done\nhere is I've made this ribbon.\n\n368\n00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:30.950\nNow note, if I wanna use this ribbon and\nsay I wanna stretch it out.\n\n369\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.030\nSee how when I stretch it out,\nit's distorting the ribbon itself?\n\n370\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.058\nIt's not really stretching in a nice way.\n\n371\n00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:39.640\nWhat I wanna do here,\n\n372\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.960\nis I wanna show you the option that\nthey have for nine slice scaling.\n\n373\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.602\nNine slice scaling when I discovered it,\nI was like this is amazing.\n\n374\n00:17:48.602 --> 00:17:52.320\n[LAUGH] Cuz what I can do here,\nI can go ahead and drag and drop this in.\n\n375\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.950\nAnd now, okay, see where it says\nenable guides for nine slice scaling?\n\n376\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.940\nI don't feel like the name really tells\nyou anything about what this is, but\n\n377\n00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.750\nit's gonna be something\nthat's really helpful.\n\n378\n00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:03.956\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm like what is this?\n\n379\n00:18:03.956 --> 00:18:07.460\nAnd I also thought like slicing,\nI think of it in\n\n380\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.340\na different term of like slicing up\nweb graphics to be able to look at.\n\n381\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.710\nBut now once I've figure\nout what it does I'm like,\n\n382\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.961\nokay the name kinda sounds the same.\n\n383\n00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:19.503\nAnd it's like the quadrants, right?\n\n384\n00:18:19.503 --> 00:18:22.572\nThere's nine quadrants, she'll show you.\n\n385\n00:18:22.572 --> 00:18:25.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a visual thing I feel like.\n\n386\n00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.060\nSo yeah, go ahead and\nyou can have something simple.\n\n387\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.520\nOr we can maybe make this an exercise\nfile where you can go ahead and hit OK.\n\n388\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.050\nAnd then now, okay,\nI'm gonna take this one over here.\n\n389\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.500\nI'm gonna drag and\ndrop this into my symbols panel.\n\n390\n00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.380\nAnd here's what I wanna do.\n\n391\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.210\nI wanna double click to edit the instance\nof my symbol wherever you wanna do that.\n\n392\n00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.490\nSo I'm gonna double-click here.\n\n393\n00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.940\nYou're about to symbol definition.\n\n394\n00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.580\nOkay, yes we saw that, we're okay.\n\n395\n00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.094\nNow what you'll see here,\nunlike the other options that we have,\n\n396\n00:18:50.094 --> 00:18:52.498\nthis has little guides\nthat go along with it.\n\n397\n00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:57.044\nAnd what these guides tell you is\nbasically how far I can stretch this\n\n398\n00:18:57.044 --> 00:18:59.290\nwithout distorting my symbols.\n\n399\n00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.520\nSo what I'm saying here is\nthat when I stretch this out,\n\n400\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.400\nI only wanna stretch this center portion.\n\n401\n00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.380\nI don't want it to stretch the little\nflags on the end cuz I don't want those to\n\n402\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.300\nend up looking distorted.\n\n403\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.700\nSo it's only gonna stretch the middle and\nkeep making that further and further out.\n\n404\n00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.486\nI'm only using the right and\nleft hand sides here.\n\n405\n00:19:18.486 --> 00:19:22.512\nBut you can use the top and bottom if you\nwant something to be able to expand up and\n\n406\n00:19:22.512 --> 00:19:24.282\ndown without really distorting.\n\n407\n00:19:24.282 --> 00:19:27.200\nJust really a nice thing depending\non the type of symbol that you have.\n\n408\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.700\nSo I can go ahead and\nnow double click out of this.\n\n409\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.735\nAnd you'll see what happens is\nI'm gonna click, hold and drag.\n\n410\n00:19:32.735 --> 00:19:36.520\nAnd it's not gonna get distorted\nquite like that original one did.\n\n411\n00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.330\nSo if I take this one back and\nthat one slides, slides.\n\n412\n00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:44.070\nAnd that one just starts to\nget a little bit wonky on us.\n\n413\n00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.155\nThis one really just stays\na little bit better.\n\n414\n00:19:46.155 --> 00:19:49.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can adjust what\nyou were doing with the guides,\n\n415\n00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.220\nlike that's still kinda\nstretching the wrong way.\n\n416\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:57.270\nJust move that, it's like the center\nsection is what kinda scales.\n\n417\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.768\nAnd everything else around it does not,\ncorrect?\n\n418\n00:19:59.768 --> 00:20:01.110\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n419\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.440\nSo I think to your point,\nI may move these in a little bit better.\n\n420\n00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.570\nIt kinda stretched a little\nbit farther than I wanted.\n\n421\n00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.023\nBut you can adjust it,\nyou can always go back and change it.\n\n422\n00:20:10.023 --> 00:20:14.174\n&gt;&gt; And as long as you turn on\nthat enable 9-Point slice,\n\n423\n00:20:14.174 --> 00:20:15.869\nthe nine thingy-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n424\n00:20:15.869 --> 00:20:17.572\n&gt;&gt; The nine's thingy.\n\n425\n00:20:17.572 --> 00:20:20.272\nThen you'll be able to go in and\nedit that symbol and have those guides.\n\n426\n00:20:20.272 --> 00:20:23.311\nOtherwise, the other symbol if it\ndoesn't have that checked off,\n\n427\n00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:26.520\nit's not gonna give you any of\nthe guides when you go in to edit it.\n\n428\n00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.562\n&gt;&gt; Correct, right, correct.\n\n429\n00:20:28.562 --> 00:20:31.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if I go ahead and select this,\n\n430\n00:20:31.025 --> 00:20:33.048\njust as an example, and I double click.\n\n431\n00:20:33.048 --> 00:20:35.580\nYou're not gonna get those guys so\nit's not gonna be an option for you.\n\n432\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:39.620\nSo, depending on what you're doing I\nwould definitely say to check it out.\n\n433\n00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.380\nSo, I think that's it.\n\n434\n00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.890\nAnything to add on symbols?\n\n435\n00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.040\n&gt;&gt; I mean we did the fun symbol sprayer.\n\n436\n00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.656\nWe talked about the whole use of it,\nto be able to reuse them.\n\n437\n00:20:49.656 --> 00:20:53.710\nThe libraries, the instances.\n\n438\n00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:58.016\nSmall little fun fact, I don't know if any\nof you all have ever used Flash before.\n\n439\n00:20:58.016 --> 00:20:59.302\nDo you remember Flash,\nway back in the day?\n\n440\n00:20:59.302 --> 00:21:00.457\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n441\n00:21:00.457 --> 00:21:03.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Flash is where we used symbols.\n\n442\n00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:09.821\nAnd then there was movie clip symbols and\nGraphic sym-.\n\n443\n00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:13.723\nWow it's been a while, but that little\ndialogue box when you first started,\n\n444\n00:21:13.723 --> 00:21:16.910\nthat said what type of symbol\nthis is when you make a new one.\n\n445\n00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.910\nThere was a drop-down in there that said\nsomething about movie clip and everything.\n\n446\n00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.480\nAnd I like to hear just don't\nworry about that anymore.\n\n447\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.890\nWhich is true because how much is\nFlash really a part of things?\n\n448\n00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.980\nIt depends on where you're at, and\neveryone's like Flash is dead.\n\n449\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:38.910\nAnd some certain places beyond just fun\nlittle graphics, it's still available.\n\n450\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.710\nBut just in case you're\never using Illustrator\n\n451\n00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.860\nin connection with Flash of some sort.\n\n452\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.655\nThat designating whether it's a movie\nclip vs a whatever the other clips were.\n\n453\n00:21:51.655 --> 00:21:52.583\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n454\n00:21:52.583 --> 00:21:57.438\n&gt;&gt; It might make a difference, but\nthat's again kind of a very small sub\n\n455\n00:21:57.438 --> 00:22:00.628\npopulation I'd say that\nwould maybe use it.\n\n456\n00:22:00.628 --> 00:22:02.120\nSo just a little history lesson.\n\n457\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.270\nIt does come from Flash and\nsome other things like that.\n\n458\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.825\nThat's the only thing I would like to add.\n\n459\n00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:09.440\nCuz you know me,\nI like to add the history of everything.\n\n460\n00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.387\nSo been around this product for\nway too long.\n\n461\n00:22:12.387 --> 00:22:15.768\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No I love it, great tip, thank you.\n\n462\n00:22:15.768 --> 00:22:17.010\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for Symbols.\n\n463\n00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.420\nThey are lots of fun, but I think\nthat's a great stopping place as well.\n\n464\n00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.440\nSo we are going t wrap it on up.\n\n465\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.660\nSigning off for CREATIVEPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Yvonne Smith.\n\n466\n00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.310\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey\n&gt;&gt; We'll see

Yes, it shouldn't be that weird, right?\n\n12\n00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:40.297\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n13\n00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:44.719\n&gt;&gt; This one's kind of funny, because we\nbasically have an entire episode dedicated\n\n14\n00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.382\nto the fact that Illustrator doesn't\nhave this natively built in.\n\n15\n00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.076\n&gt;&gt; No, and it's like,\nwer were talking about it.\n\n16\n00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:53.920\nThey gave us the crop tool in images.\n\n17\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.172\nWe can crop an image.\n\n18\n00:00:55.172 --> 00:00:56.778\nI was like, yes, and this one's like,\n\n19\n00:00:56.778 --> 00:00:59.291\ncan't you just make a bullet\nbutton where it's like, click.\n\n20\n00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:00.398\nI want a bullet button.\n\n21\n00:01:00.398 --> 00:01:02.259\nNo, it's not that easy.\n\n22\n00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:05.100\nIt's way harder than it should be.\n\n23\n00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.517\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, it's not hard.\n\n24\n00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:09.970\nIt's just way harder than it should be.\n\n25\n00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.051\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:11.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.\n\n27\n00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:12.123\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n28\n00:01:12.123 --> 00:01:13.695\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk about\nwhat that looks like here.\n\n29\n00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:19.670\nBullets and numbering, not something that\nnatively exists in Illustrator, why?\n\n30\n00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.189\nI don't know.\n\n31\n00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.804\nYou have that bullet button in many\nother programs, or just numbering, and\n\n32\n00:01:23.804 --> 00:01:27.720\nyou can go ahead and click that and\neverything will work out beautifully.\n\n33\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.160\nWe're still gonna have a beautiful\nend result here in Illustrator,\n\n34\n00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.020\nwe're just gonna have to kinda go about\nit in a little bit funny of a way.\n\n35\n00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.090\nSo what I have here,\nif you wanna go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.770\nlook at this,\nI've basically built my grocery list.\n\n37\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.940\nSo I really love me some fruit\nbasically is what I'm saying.\n\n38\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.100\nSo I've got a list here, and\nyou can basically, just go ahead and\n\n39\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.760\ntype something out.\n\n40\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.737\nAnything that you would typically bullet,\nright?\n\n41\n00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:51.183\nNow, you'll see, okay,\nI'm looking at my Character panel.\n\n42\n00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:53.532\nI'm looking in Paragraph panel.\n\n43\n00:01:53.532 --> 00:01:55.325\n[SOUND] I don't see any bullets.\n\n44\n00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:59.292\nI don't see an option for that, not\nan option that you have in Illustrator.\n\n45\n00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:01.110\nSo we have to kinda fake it.\n\n46\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.034\nCouple different ways\nthat you can do this.\n\n47\n00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:07.874\nMy personal favorite is just to use\nthe keyboard shortcut Alt or Option and\n\n48\n00:02:07.874 --> 00:02:10.850\nthe letter,\nthe letter [LAUGH] the number 8.\n\n49\n00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.110\nSo if I hit Alt+8 that's gonna go ahead\nand add a bullet in there for me.\n\n50\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.910\nSo that's one option.\n\n51\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.117\nSecond option, and I'll go ahead and\ndo that a couple times, Alt+8.\n\n52\n00:02:21.117 --> 00:02:23.896\n&gt;&gt; And you're adding just\na single space after that?\n\n53\n00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:25.026\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yes, yes.\n\n54\n00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:29.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you wanted more space\nbetween it, you could fake it and\n\n55\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.500\ndo a couple more spaces.\n\n56\n00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.468\nBecause we talked about this before the\nepisode, we're not gonna get in tabs, and\n\n57\n00:02:35.468 --> 00:02:36.728\ntab software [CROSSTALK].\n\n58\n00:02:36.728 --> 00:02:40.386\nSo if you want more space just do\nthe thing we tell you not to do, space,\n\n59\n00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:42.133\nspace, space, space, space.\n\n60\n00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.403\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\n\n61\n00:02:43.403 --> 00:02:46.150\nof course in our advanced text episode we\nwere like don't add additional spaces when\n\n62\n00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.174\nyou don't need to,\nwell here we're breaking our own rules.\n\n63\n00:02:48.174 --> 00:02:51.016\nSo I'm doing Alt+8, and\nthen I'm just adding a space.\n\n64\n00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:52.600\nSo we;ll do that kind of for\nour first three.\n\n65\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.330\nNow, our second option here\nis to go into our glyphs.\n\n66\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.650\nNow glyphs sound really crazy and\nfancy, and they kind of are.\n\n67\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.590\nSo glyphs are gonna be basically a way for\n\n68\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.350\nyou to see kind of all the characters\nthat you have within a font.\n\n69\n00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.360\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\npull up my Type menu.\n\n70\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.491\nAnd then from there,\nI'm gonna go to Glyphs.\n\n71\n00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.396\nNow when you see, I pull this up.\n\n72\n00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:18.468\nI'm searching the entire font.\n\n73\n00:03:18.468 --> 00:03:19.519\nAnd I can see, okay,\n\n74\n00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.806\nwhoa I have all the special little\ncharacters that I have in there.\n\n75\n00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:24.941\nAnd you kinda look,\nyou see some crazy stuff.\n\n76\n00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:28.607\nThere's accent marks and\nall that, that's great.\n\n77\n00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:31.044\nIf you ever need to know\nhow to add an accent mark.\n\n78\n00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.651\nIf you're doing something in French,\nadd all that.\n\n79\n00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:36.105\n&gt;&gt; Or the umlauts.\n\n80\n00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:37.761\nI love saying that.\n\n81\n00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:40.096\nUmlaut, the two dots over the o or\nthe u's or whatever.\n\n82\n00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:44.831\nNot to go too crazy off to, on the rails,\noff the rails, on the rails,\n\n83\n00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:49.806\nthis is all part of the open type font and\nevery font is either an open type or\n\n84\n00:03:49.806 --> 00:03:54.493\ntwo type and how many characters it\nhas within that particular font.\n\n85\n00:03:54.493 --> 00:03:57.798\nThe 65,536 characters that\nare available for you.\n\n86\n00:03:57.798 --> 00:03:58.685\nYes, that it is true.\n\n87\n00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:05.632\nAnd it allows for\nall of these extra letters and things.\n\n88\n00:04:05.632 --> 00:04:08.970\nSo if you're picking a font, you go to\nhere it's like I don't see all this.\n\n89\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.730\nIt's the nature of the font itself,\n\n90\n00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.115\nif it allows for extended character\nsets or anything to that effect.\n\n91\n00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:18.950\nSo just keep that in mind in\ncase you don't see anything, but\n\n92\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.500\nI think we're gonna be going to\na different font anyway, as it may be.\n\n93\n00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.011\nLike with the Webdings and the wink.\n\n94\n00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:27.051\n[LAUGH] I'm not gonna go to the Wingdings,\nbut\n\n95\n00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:30.098\nyou can Wingding all day long,\nI mean we can.\n\n96\n00:04:30.098 --> 00:04:32.762\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz the bullet doesn't have to be\n\n97\n00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:35.330\nthe same character as the font\nthat you're choosing.\n\n98\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.126\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that's why I want kitty cats for\n\n99\n00:04:37.126 --> 00:04:37.755\nmy bullets.\n\n100\n00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:42.396\nThen you're gonna need to go into\nthe Webding or the Wingding font.\n\n101\n00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:43.034\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n102\n00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:46.572\n&gt;&gt; That has those funny little\nthings like the kitty cats.\n\n103\n00:04:46.572 --> 00:04:47.654\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know I heard\n\n104\n00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:50.132\nyou say something about kitty cats\nbefore this episode and I was like,\n\n105\n00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:51.607\nI don't know what she's talking about.\n\n106\n00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:54.832\nBut yes, you could go into your\nWingdings and you could grab,\n\n107\n00:04:54.832 --> 00:04:56.890\nI could have a peace sign for my bullet.\n\n108\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.659\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I pick that one too a lot.\n\n109\n00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:59.636\nThe yin yang, yeah.\n\n110\n00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:01.754\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n111\n00:05:01.754 --> 00:05:03.068\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like we're the same brain.\n\n112\n00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:06.917\n&gt;&gt; See,\nI was just gonna go into my Open Sans and\n\n113\n00:05:06.917 --> 00:05:09.588\npick this little guy-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n114\n00:05:09.588 --> 00:05:10.906\n&gt;&gt; That looks like a bullet but\n\n115\n00:05:10.906 --> 00:05:12.173\nI like the peace sign too.\n\n116\n00:05:12.173 --> 00:05:13.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n117\n00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.634\nOnce you find it, peace sign,\nkitty cat, plain old bullet,\n\n118\n00:05:16.634 --> 00:05:20.530\nwhatever you want to use just double-click\nto go ahead and add that in there.\n\n119\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.733\n&gt;&gt; Just to notice where we found the\nWingdings, it's on the bottom like that's\n\n120\n00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:26.390\nthe font picker down-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n121\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.240\n&gt;&gt; At the bottom where it says Open Sans.\n\n122\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.610\nYou could change that to any font really.\n\n123\n00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.516\nAnd then be able to use\ntheir character sets or\n\n124\n00:05:34.516 --> 00:05:37.122\nthe different glyphs that live in here.\n\n125\n00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:40.840\nSo if you wanted a diamond, you know,\nthat's not as crazy as a kitty cat.\n\n126\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.675\nWe could use a diamond.\n\n127\n00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:46.225\n[LAUGH] And so you can go into those\ndifferent fonts that might have a little\n\n128\n00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:47.948\nbit of funness added to it.\n\n129\n00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.013\nYep, I said funness.\n\n130\n00:05:49.013 --> 00:05:50.987\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n131\n00:05:50.987 --> 00:05:52.675\n&gt;&gt; So just,\nthat's how I usually go with it.\n\n132\n00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:53.185\n&gt;&gt; You went there.\n\n133\n00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:53.732\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n134\n00:05:53.732 --> 00:05:55.019\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n135\n00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:58.600\nyou can go with whatever you\nfind that you wanna work with.\n\n136\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.119\nAnd this is actually kinda helpful too\ncuz you can see it comes with registered\n\n137\n00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:04.393\ncopyright symbols,\nthings that you need to add,\n\n138\n00:06:04.393 --> 00:06:06.740\nwe get little extra fun\nfacts in here with this one.\n\n139\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.294\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndouble-click and add another.\n\n140\n00:06:09.294 --> 00:06:13.941\n&gt;&gt; You do that out to me because that\nin Word is Insert Special Character and\n\n141\n00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:17.819\nthat's where you can get the trademark and\nthe copyright.\n\n142\n00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.639\nIf you were looking for that,\nlike I need to put in a copyright.\n\n143\n00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.883\nBecause you're a part of the company\nthat this is what it is,\n\n144\n00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:29.225\nyou go to the Glyphs panel to be\nable to type that character in.\n\n145\n00:06:29.225 --> 00:06:31.385\nSo I'm glad you threw that out and\n\n146\n00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:34.483\njust keeping on with my\nlittle comments [LAUGH].\n\n147\n00:06:34.483 --> 00:06:37.270\n&gt;&gt; Just dropping down some extra\nknowledge in this episode, right.\n\n148\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.775\nSo you have these options, one thing I\nnoticed, it's kinda weird with the glyphs.\n\n149\n00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:45.592\nI'm just doing a single space here and\nit almost looks like a tab.\n\n150\n00:06:45.592 --> 00:06:48.638\nYeah, so that can get you a little.\n\n151\n00:06:48.638 --> 00:06:52.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm sure usually you're gonna\nhave your bullets be consistent across\n\n152\n00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.745\nthe paragraphs or whatever.\n\n153\n00:06:53.745 --> 00:07:00.256\nBut the Webdings and Wingdings do\ngive you these weird massive spaces.\n\n154\n00:07:00.256 --> 00:07:03.424\nI think it's because of-\n&gt;&gt; It's the tracking.\n\n155\n00:07:03.424 --> 00:07:07.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or where the character\nactually occupies that space?\n\n156\n00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:09.046\nMaybe it's a mono space font.\n\n157\n00:07:09.046 --> 00:07:11.092\nI'm actually going deeper into\nthings that I don't know.\n\n158\n00:07:11.092 --> 00:07:11.674\n&gt;&gt; I think it is.\n\n159\n00:07:11.674 --> 00:07:13.641\nI was gonnago in there.\n\n160\n00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:17.198\nI think it's a mono space font which\nmeans there's a lot of space between each\n\n161\n00:07:17.198 --> 00:07:17.806\ncharacter.\n\n162\n00:07:17.806 --> 00:07:22.116\nSo our Wingdings get a little funny,\nbasically is what I'm saying.\n\n163\n00:07:22.116 --> 00:07:24.110\nBut, you know, whatever.\n\n164\n00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.267\nIf you wanted to you could adjust\nthe kerning or something like that.\n\n165\n00:07:26.267 --> 00:07:28.220\nYou wanna kinda get back into that.\n\n166\n00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.950\nNow one thing I did\nalso want to point out.\n\n167\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.190\nYou'll notice there's a slight difference\nbetween that Alt+8 option I chose and\n\n168\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.010\nthe glyphs option,\nthese are a little bit smaller bullets, so\n\n169\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.800\nmaybe it's just something\nyou wanna look at.\n\n170\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.340\nIt kinda depends on what you wanna use.\n\n171\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.940\nBut one thing I do like that Alt+8 option\nfor is that you can use it anywhere.\n\n172\n00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.000\nSo sometimes I'll use it\nin the middle of type.\n\n173\n00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.920\nI know I'm getting on\na little bit of a tangent.\n\n174\n00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:57.070\nBut I'll go here and\nI'll say Bananas, Alt+8, Apples.\n\n175\n00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.400\nSo sometimes if you wanna kinda\nseparate things out that way,\n\n176\n00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.380\nit makes it a little bit easier for you.\n\n177\n00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.230\nSo just an extra, again,\njust dropping all kinds of knowledge here.\n\n178\n00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.460\nSo that's basically gonna\nbe our way to fake this,\n\n179\n00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.010\nnow one thing that I wanted to point\nout in terms of kind of spacing.\n\n180\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.380\nSo I know and\n\n181\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.370\nVonne knows where I'm going with this cuz\nit's probably a pet peeve for both of us.\n\n182\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.220\nWhat if you have a bullet\nthat falls onto two lines?\n\n183\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:25.243\nSo I'm gonna say grapes are my favorite\nfruit, and see what happens here?\n\n184\n00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:28.362\nIgnore the hyphenations, we can turn\nthat off, that's pretty easy to fix.\n\n185\n00:08:28.362 --> 00:08:29.794\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorry.\n\n186\n00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:31.969\n&gt;&gt; Are you laughing at grapes\nbeing my favorite fruit?\n\n187\n00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:35.424\n&gt;&gt; Well, it says grapes my\nare favorite fruit [LAUGH].\n\n188\n00:08:35.424 --> 00:08:37.229\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Whatever.\n\n189\n00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:39.553\n&gt;&gt; I come out here like,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:41.024\n&gt;&gt; She'll catch it, okay, no,\n\n191\n00:08:41.024 --> 00:08:41.822\nI'll tell her.\n\n192\n00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:43.372\n&gt;&gt; No, no, she's not catching it.\n\n193\n00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:44.477\nShe's just going with it.\n\n194\n00:08:44.477 --> 00:08:47.188\nAgain, we see where my strengths lie.\n\n195\n00:08:47.188 --> 00:08:51.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Grapes are my favorite fruit.\n\n196\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.520\nAnd now, when I look at this, that text,\n\n197\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.660\nthat word favorite,\nis falling below the bullet.\n\n198\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.100\nThat's something that typography\nreally just a big no no.\n\n199\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.010\nYou always wanna try and\nkeep that clean line as best you can.\n\n200\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.077\nYou want all your text to line up, and\nyou want all your bullets to line up.\n\n201\n00:09:08.077 --> 00:09:10.536\nYou don't want this one kinda\ngetting in the way of things.\n\n202\n00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:13.692\nSo how are we gonna kind\nof fake that spacing?\n\n203\n00:09:13.692 --> 00:09:16.564\nWhat we have to do is,\nwe have to go into our Paragraph panel.\n\n204\n00:09:16.564 --> 00:09:18.017\nHowever you wanna do it,\nI'm clicking up here.\n\n205\n00:09:18.017 --> 00:09:19.562\nI also have my Paragraph panel open.\n\n206\n00:09:19.562 --> 00:09:26.843\nAnd what you can do I believe, okay,\npositive first line indent, negative, yes.\n\n207\n00:09:26.843 --> 00:09:31.243\nSo positive left indent rather,\nnegative first line indent.\n\n208\n00:09:31.243 --> 00:09:32.652\nIt's weird, I know.\n\n209\n00:09:32.652 --> 00:09:34.840\nWe said this was gonna be weird,\nand it is.\n\n210\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:40.500\n&gt;&gt; Well it moves everything in,\nso it indents into the left.\n\n211\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.470\nAnd then you want that\nfirst line to come out.\n\n212\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.285\nAnd what you do is you\njust play around with it.\n\n213\n00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:49.301\nThere's no actual exact numberings\nof if it’s a positive nine,\n\n214\n00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:50.768\nit’s a negative nine.\n\n215\n00:09:50.768 --> 00:09:55.935\nNo, you just kinda line it up visually\nof where does that word grape start and\n\n216\n00:09:55.935 --> 00:09:58.923\nthen the next line which\nwould be favorite,\n\n217\n00:09:58.923 --> 00:10:02.417\nhow does that line up enough\nvisually to look good?\n\n218\n00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:03.984\nAnd then that's where you go.\n\n219\n00:10:03.984 --> 00:10:07.255\nJust keep on going left and\nkeep on going negative first and\n\n220\n00:10:07.255 --> 00:10:09.204\nyou'll line them up eventually.\n\n221\n00:10:09.204 --> 00:10:09.809\n&gt;&gt; You will get there.\n\n222\n00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:13.269\nYeah, I'm sorry, while you were\ntalking I had to get rid of the-\n\n223\n00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:14.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n224\n00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.841\n&gt;&gt; It was kinda the line.\n\n225\n00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:18.541\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gotta stay consistent.\n\n226\n00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.044\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I can't do it.\n\n227\n00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:21.893\n[LAUGH] I can't do it anymore.\n\n228\n00:10:21.893 --> 00:10:26.741\nSo what you'll see here is that that kind\nof gives the illusion that all these\n\n229\n00:10:26.741 --> 00:10:28.950\nare in a perfectly straight line.\n\n230\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.170\nSo basically we are giving the illusion\nthat we had a bullet button and\n\n231\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.190\ndoing something that you know another\nprogram would have done for us.\n\n232\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.880\nSo again, if you want to do that you're\ngonna wanna make sure that you go into\n\n233\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.260\nyour Paragraph panel.\n\n234\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.900\nYou wanna go to a positive left indent\nwhich is just that first option and\n\n235\n00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.070\nthen some sort of negative first line and\n\n236\n00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.340\nexactly what Vonne said,\nthere's no real set option.\n\n237\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.423\nI can't tell you that it's always gonna\nbe positive five, negative seven.\n\n238\n00:10:54.423 --> 00:10:57.353\nIt's gonna change\ndepending on what you need.\n\n239\n00:10:57.353 --> 00:10:59.458\n&gt;&gt; And the font size and all that stuff.\n\n240\n00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:05.121\nAnd another big point to note is if you\nenter off of your bullet like in a regular\n\n241\n00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:10.105\nword or whatever program that's like,\nthe bullet button is on.\n\n242\n00:11:10.105 --> 00:11:12.505\nCuz it is a paragraph level formatting.\n\n243\n00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:16.100\nYou would enter and it keeps on bulleting,\nkeeps on numbering.\n\n244\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.050\nYou'd go back and delete one and\nyou change the other number and\n\n245\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.080\nit just keeps on continuing.\n\n246\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.470\nThat doesn't happen here.\n\n247\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.970\nYou have to manually copy\n\n248\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.030\nthe paragraph with the bullet character,\nwith your spacing.\n\n249\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.840\nThen go ahead and change out the text.\n\n250\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.981\nIt doesn't work,\nyeah your numbering right here.\n\n251\n00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:35.612\nShe's manually typing.\n\n252\n00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:39.571\n&gt;&gt; I'm manually typing in the number\nthree, and I'm gonna go here,\n\n253\n00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:43.176\nmanually type in, or just skip it,\nmanually type in kiwi and\n\n254\n00:11:43.176 --> 00:11:46.447\nnow let's say I wanna go ahead and\nadd something here.\n\n255\n00:11:46.447 --> 00:11:48.987\nI'm basically just visually\ndoing what Vonne was saying.\n\n256\n00:11:48.987 --> 00:11:50.932\nIf I wanna go ahead and\nadd something here,\n\n257\n00:11:50.932 --> 00:11:52.669\nnote it's not adding a number for me.\n\n258\n00:11:52.669 --> 00:11:54.796\nI have to go in here and say find three.\n\n259\n00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:57.830\nI need grapes to be the third one.\n\n260\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.976\nThen I have to go in here and\nchange the number.\n\n261\n00:11:59.976 --> 00:12:02.630\nSo there's just nothing auto about it.\n\n262\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.951\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we put the title of\nthe episode as Bullets and Numbering and\n\n263\n00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:10.199\nwe were talking like there is no numbering\nit's just another alpha numeric character.\n\n264\n00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:13.536\nIt's a manual thing, so you don't\nhave to go to the Glyphs panel or\n\n265\n00:12:13.536 --> 00:12:17.348\nanything fancy with that just know you\ncan do your spacing in the first line,\n\n266\n00:12:17.348 --> 00:12:18.793\npositive and the negative.\n\n267\n00:12:18.793 --> 00:12:23.145\nWait no, positive left negative\nfirst to do all your spacing for\n\n268\n00:12:23.145 --> 00:12:26.060\nmultiple lines, but it is full on manual.\n\n269\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.739\nThere is no tricks there.\n\n270\n00:12:27.739 --> 00:12:30.023\nYou gotta do it all by yourself.\n\n271\n00:12:30.023 --> 00:12:30.685\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n272\n00:12:30.685 --> 00:12:33.983\n&gt;&gt; Not so much fun, but it happens, so.\n\n273\n00:12:33.983 --> 00:12:35.833\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't often tell you you have to do\n\n274\n00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:36.780\nthings the old fashioned way.\n\n275\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.262\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is kind of like the one time in\n\n276\n00:12:38.262 --> 00:12:40.385\nIllustrator you have to do\nsomething the old fashioned way.\n\n277\n00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.994\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely, and it is one of those\n\n278\n00:12:42.994 --> 00:12:46.426\nthings where it does trip people up\nof why can't I do a bolded list?\n\n279\n00:12:46.426 --> 00:12:48.158\nCuz they don't have it.\n\n280\n00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:49.008\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n281\n00:12:49.008 --> 00:12:51.814\n&gt;&gt; I think that covers pretty\nmuch everything, right?\n\n282\n00:12:51.814 --> 00:12:52.537\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n283\n00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:56.724\n&gt;&gt; We got the glyphs and we did the\nspacing and we totally skipped over tabs,\n\n284\n00:12:56.724 --> 00:12:58.103\nwhich was a good thing.\n\n285\n00:12:58.103 --> 00:13:03.108\nI love me some tab stops, but I think it's\na little out of the scope of this one.\n\n286\n00:13:03.108 --> 00:13:05.463\nAnd you'll actually probably thank us, so.\n\n287\n00:13:05.463 --> 00:13:07.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna know.\n\n288\n00:13:07.595 --> 00:13:08.141\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n289\n00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:10.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, well I think that's good for\n\n290\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.296\nthis episode.\n\n291\n00:13:11.296 --> 00:13:12.631\nAnd now you know how to do it.\n\n292\n00:13:12.631 --> 00:13:14.529\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n293\n00:13:14.529 --> 00:13:17.182\nSigning off for CreativePro TV.\n\n294\n00:13:17.182 --> 00:13:18.009\nI'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n295\n00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:19.114\n&gt;&gt;

I know, of course.\n\n12\n00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:39.818\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nbefore the show we were just like,\n\n13\n00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:43.741\ncuz those are the tools that we're\ngoing to be covering in this episode.\n\n14\n00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.530\nAnd we're like, so\nwhat should we name this cutting?\n\n15\n00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530\nThat sounds like, no,\ncuz we are cutting paths.\n\n16\n00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.400\nWe didn't know what to say and\n\n17\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.500\nthen we just had way too much fun\ncoming up with knife, eraser, scissors.\n\n18\n00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.815\n&gt;&gt; There will be a tournament at the end.\n\n19\n00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:01.030\n[LAUGH] All right so\nwhat are we doing here?\n\n20\n00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.910\nBasically we're finding\ndifferent ways to cut paths.\n\n21\n00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.300\nSo if you want to, no pun intended,\ncut out using the ad anchor point tool or\n\n22\n00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.390\ndelete anchor point tool or\nany of those things,\n\n23\n00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.545\nthere are also some other options\navailable to you in Illustrator.\n\n24\n00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:16.630\nSo, such as our eraser scissors knife.\n\n25\n00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.860\nSo what we're gonna do,\nI'm gonna go ahead and hop in here.\n\n26\n00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.800\nI have a couple shapes already created.\n\n27\n00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.790\nI through these out here especially for\nVonne cuz she makes fun of me,\n\n28\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.110\nI always go to the rectangle tool.\n\n29\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.110\nSo we're doing a polygon and a star.\n\n30\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.132\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, polygon.\n\n31\n00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:29.945\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know.\n\n32\n00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:31.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Crazy.\n\n33\n00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.990\n&gt;&gt; I'm really mixing it up guys, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.030\nSo what we're going to do,\nwe're going to start off with this, and\n\n35\n00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.390\nI'm going to go ahead and\ngrab my eraser tool first.\n\n36\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.862\nI'm going in opposite order of our knife,\nwhatever we said.\n\n37\n00:01:43.862 --> 00:01:44.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n38\n00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:47.849\nwhat I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go\nahead with my eraser tool first.\n\n39\n00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:52.650\nEraser tool one, again, you know, you've\nkind of seen this in some other things but\n\n40\n00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.690\nI can use my right and\n\n41\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.750\nleft bracket keys on my keyboard\nto make this larger or smaller.\n\n42\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.360\nSo you can kind of see that preview\nof the diameter there with that.\n\n43\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.835\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nuse my right arrow key to make, or\n\n44\n00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:05.785\nright bracket key rather,\nto make that a little bit larger,\n\n45\n00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:07.355\nleft bracket key to make\nit a little bit smaller.\n\n46\n00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:10.605\nAnd what we do with our eraser tool,\nyou can kinda just imagine\n\n47\n00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:14.910\nerasing something with a pencil,\nyou can kinda just swipe through that.\n\n48\n00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.050\nYou can go ahead and erase it.\n\n49\n00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.270\nNow you'll notice that\nI put a stroke on this.\n\n50\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.590\nI put a stroke on this for a reason,\nso that you can see when I\n\n51\n00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.520\nuse the eraser tool, it's gonna maintain\nthe characteristics of my shape.\n\n52\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.900\nThat's gonna come into play a little\nbit later, cuz you'll see how\n\n53\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.190\nsomething like your scissors tool\nmight work a little bit differently.\n\n54\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.840\nAnd basically here you can go ahead and\njust keep swiping.\n\n55\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.021\nNow also note how it's adding points for\nus.\n\n56\n00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:43.117\nSo you'll see here I have all of these\nadditional points added that I could go\n\n57\n00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:47.149\nwith my white arrow tool, and maybe\nI'll adjust the stroke color on this so\n\n58\n00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.500\nyou guys can see it a little better.\n\n59\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.180\nI can go here and\n\n60\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.310\nI can adjust all of those additional\npoints that are now added for me.\n\n61\n00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.450\nSo that's kind of a nice thing\nthat the eraser tool does for us.\n\n62\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.470\n&gt;&gt; And those are now individual shapes,\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.500\nIf we went to the black arrow tool and\nmoved that, yeah, that's separate,\n\n64\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.820\nthat's separate cuz you basically\nerased all the way through, in a sense.\n\n65\n00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.700\nYeah, we got that extra little-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] that\n\n66\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.695\ndisappeared, I'm sorry.\n\n67\n00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:16.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's those kinda gremlins,\nI call it,\n\n68\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.592\nthey kinda leave little tidbits here.\n\n69\n00:03:18.592 --> 00:03:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But those are individual paths, or\n\n70\n00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.850\nclosed paths, shapes now that you can edit\nindividually that go, yeah, that way.\n\n71\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.350\nSo just making sure you know it's not\na group, it's not a compound path or\n\n72\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.370\nanything else that we've kind of gone\nthrough in the sequence of these episodes.\n\n73\n00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.740\nThey're individual shapes, and\nI've used this eraser to do just that.\n\n74\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Kind of free form cut out,\n\n75\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.155\nif you want to say, individual shapes from\none starting, what was that thing called?\n\n76\n00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:47.927\nA polygon, right?\n\n77\n00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:48.915\n&gt;&gt; Oh,yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n78\n00:03:48.915 --> 00:03:50.005\n&gt;&gt; That shaped thing [LAUGH].\n\n79\n00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:51.820\n&gt;&gt; This is a quiz, what is she asking?\n\n80\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but no, exactly.\n\n81\n00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:57.147\nSo when I went ahead and I changed\nthe stroke color, I selected all of them,\n\n82\n00:03:57.147 --> 00:03:58.710\nI didn't just selected one.\n\n83\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.480\nIt wasn't a group or anything like that.\n\n84\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.710\nThese are all now individually shapes\nwith their own individual points.\n\n85\n00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.790\nAnd again, note how it maintains\nthe characteristics of my original shape.\n\n86\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.080\nSo it kept that stroke color,\nbasically was what I'm saying, and\n\n87\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.200\nadded a stroke to all of our new shapes.\n\n88\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.610\nSo that's one thing with the eraser tool.\n\n89\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.760\nNow, I think I may kind of either\nstart with a new shape or,\n\n90\n00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.730\nthis one's too far gone I feel like for\nme to use again.\n\n91\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.040\nSo let me go ahead and make a new polygon,\nand I may even use this star here for\n\n92\n00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.390\nthis next example.\n\n93\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.600\nI want to go into our path eraser tool.\n\n94\n00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.464\nNow are path eraser tool is not\nnecessarily in the same category as our\n\n95\n00:04:34.464 --> 00:04:36.140\neraser, scissors, knife.\n\n96\n00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.272\nSo you see if you hover over, or\nclick and hold rather, on your eraser\n\n97\n00:04:39.272 --> 00:04:43.390\ntool you get the scissors and the knife\nand it's all neatly packaged together.\n\n98\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.630\nBut I wanna bring up the path eraser\ntool now just because it has the word\n\n99\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.600\neraser in it.\n\n100\n00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.490\nI feel like it's something that could be\nkind of misleading, not misleading, but\n\n101\n00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.500\nI feel like it just kind\nof ties together basically.\n\n102\n00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.360\nSo what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and grab that star here.\n\n103\n00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.540\nI want to use this as an example.\n\n104\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.770\nOur path eraser tool is actually\nhidden underneath our shaper tool.\n\n105\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.550\nSo I'm gonna click and\nhold on my shaper tool.\n\n106\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.260\nRemember way way back to that\npencil smooth, things like that?\n\n107\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.610\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ngrab this path eraser.\n\n108\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.240\nIt basically actually just looks like\na pencil kinda upside down there.\n\n109\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.620\nSo I'm gonna grab that path eraser.\n\n110\n00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.560\nNow your path eraser just erases paths.\n\n111\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.650\nSo what we're gonna do,\nif I go ahead and slide right here, and\n\n112\n00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.530\nyou'll see I actually need to go back and\nselect that.\n\n113\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.580\nAt some point, it came unselected.\n\n114\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.480\nIt's just going to erase where my path is.\n\n115\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.290\nSo if I kinda glide that around here,\nit doesn't have to be perfect.\n\n116\n00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.060\nYou see how that blue\npath outline went away?\n\n117\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.150\nIt may not really look that different now,\nbut look if I go ahead and\n\n118\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.350\nI just convert this to a stroke.\n\n119\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.090\nI'll even make this a little bit darker so\nyou can see it.\n\n120\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.240\nI'm missing that path.\n\n121\n00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.200\nSo it kinda just takes it away.\n\n122\n00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.200\nAgain, just gonna depend on what you\nneed or what you you're trying to do.\n\n123\n00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.956\nAnd certainly as I go through and\nerase more paths,\n\n124\n00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:59.750\nI'll maybe make that fill again, you're\ngonna start to see some wonky things.\n\n125\n00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.060\nSo it's gonna take my star,\nand kinda go like that.\n\n126\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.705\nIt's something that you can use\nany time you just need to be like,\n\n127\n00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:09.820\nyou just need to get rid of that one\npath a little bit individually there.\n\n128\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.320\nI don't need to go full\nthe way into my eraser tool,\n\n129\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.860\nI just need to get rid of\nthat one little piece.\n\n130\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.080\nSo you can kinda keep working with it and\nsee how it adjusts as you go.\n\n131\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, when we first started this\nepisode she's like, the path eraser tool.\n\n132\n00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.410\nI'm like, wait, what?\n\n133\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.330\nI forgot about this, yeah.\n\n134\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.490\nBut just to remind myself,\nit's erasing from point to point.\n\n135\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.000\nOn that star,\ncould you erase half of that?\n\n136\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You can, okay.\n\n137\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.440\nI thought it's very much like\na regular eraser on your pencil, but\n\n138\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.000\nyou're saying just different than\nthe eraser that went though the cloud.\n\n139\n00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.550\nBut for lack of a better terms,\nthis is just the stroke, just the path.\n\n140\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.117\nIt doesn't have anything really to do\nwith the fill, it's the path itself.\n\n141\n00:06:54.117 --> 00:06:56.035\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It erases fully, not make,\n\n142\n00:06:56.035 --> 00:06:59.647\nthe other one almost made another\npath where the eraser kind of went\n\n143\n00:06:59.647 --> 00:07:01.055\nthrough everything.\n\n144\n00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:03.445\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly,\nthis is just taking apart a path.\n\n145\n00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:04.945\nAnd I think that was a great point to add,\n\n146\n00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:09.040\nthat it will only erase the part\nof the path that you want to.\n\n147\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.360\nYou don't have to go fully\nfrom point to point.\n\n148\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.830\nI can have something here where I just\nkind of went in between like that.\n\n149\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.846\n&gt;&gt; Point to add.\n\n150\n00:07:15.846 --> 00:07:17.953\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, sorry,\n\n151\n00:07:17.953 --> 00:07:22.137\nI'm over here laughing at\nmyself like that's so funny.\n\n152\n00:07:22.137 --> 00:07:23.088\n&gt;&gt; She's got jokes.\n\n153\n00:07:23.088 --> 00:07:25.122\n&gt;&gt; We're erasing and she said point.\n\n154\n00:07:25.122 --> 00:07:26.406\n[LAUGH] Sorry.\n\n155\n00:07:26.406 --> 00:07:31.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, moving on.\n\n156\n00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:32.203\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n157\n00:07:32.203 --> 00:07:36.631\nAll right, so you can see here,\nI feel like I've just made a logo for\n\n158\n00:07:36.631 --> 00:07:39.690\na rock band with my cool star,\nso we have that.\n\n159\n00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.296\nI'm making fun of Vonne for her jokes and\nthen I'm like, I just make something for\n\n160\n00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.195\na rock band, yeah.\n\n161\n00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:45.736\n&gt;&gt; I'm like,\nthat's totally what it looks like.\n\n162\n00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:49.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so yeah,\n\n163\n00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.120\nwe're pretty cool.\n\n164\n00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Professional faces.\n\n165\n00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.865\nProfessional faces now.\n\n166\n00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:57.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll go ahead but\nwe'll reign it back in.\n\n167\n00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.040\nAnd I want to talk about\nour scissors tool.\n\n168\n00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.440\nYou know what, maybe I am going to\nkeep the star up in case I decide to\n\n169\n00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:02.960\nuse it later.\n\n170\n00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.150\nSo our scissors tool is gonna\nbe a little bit different.\n\n171\n00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.580\nI feel that out of these,\nthe erase, scissors, knife,\n\n172\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.780\nthe scissors are the most\neasily messed up, if you will.\n\n173\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.180\nI'm not gonna say complicated.\n\n174\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.810\nBut the way the scissors\n\n175\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.140\ntool works is you basically have to\nselect one point and select another.\n\n176\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.110\nSo if you think about\nactually using scissors,\n\n177\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.150\nyou can kind of just pick your\nstart point and your end point.\n\n178\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:36.950\nSo if I wanna cut from here to here,\nI'm gonna single click on each point.\n\n179\n00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.480\nThat start where I'm kind of cutting in,\nand then the end where I'm cutting out.\n\n180\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.177\nNow it looks like nothing happened,\nhopefully something did.\n\n181\n00:08:43.177 --> 00:08:46.300\n[LAUGH] It's always like,\nshe did it right, she did it right.\n\n182\n00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.140\nAnd you see what happens is that will\ngo ahead and separate that shape out.\n\n183\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.380\nYou'll also notice that this is not\nmaintaining the characteristics of\n\n184\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.190\nthe original shape.\n\n185\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:59.560\nSo it's not kind of adding in that\nadditional path like our eraser did, so\n\n186\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.470\nyou can see how my stroke\nbecame separated out.\n\n187\n00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.880\n&gt;&gt; It's almost the eraser,\nif you went all the way through,\n\n188\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.990\nit could create a closed path,\nthis is staying open.\n\n189\n00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.040\nBut again, you could take the eraser and\nnot go all the way through.\n\n190\n00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.050\nSo I don't want you to think it's\nalways gonna create a closed path.\n\n191\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.130\nBut yeah, keeping the characteristics\nof the whole stroke and\n\n192\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.900\nshape, stroke and shape?\n\n193\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n194\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.400\n&gt;&gt; This is open, fully open.\n\n195\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.230\nYeah, it doesn't connect across.\n\n196\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.560\nCuz the eraser would've made\na connecting line, in a sense.\n\n197\n00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.540\nClose that path off.\n\n198\n00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.031\nHere you don't see any closed path, yeah.\n\n199\n00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:37.990\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're trying to do.\n\n200\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.280\nI don't want to confuse you\nwith all of these terms, but\n\n201\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.960\njust throwing out different\nways of explaining it, so.\n\n202\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.300\nAnd the other thing that I always talked\nabout with the scissors, it's like,\n\n203\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.250\nas opposed to the knife.\n\n204\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.950\nI always think of it like if you had a\npiece of string or a piece of hair, you're\n\n205\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.410\nnot gonna want to use a knife for that,\nyou'll want to use a scissors to just cut.\n\n206\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.280\nAnd you cut one place,\n\n207\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.920\nyou gotta cut the other cuz you want\nthat little piece of string to stay.\n\n208\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.220\nSo that was just another\nlittle metaphor that I use.\n\n209\n00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.630\n&gt;&gt; It's a good metaphor.\n\n210\n00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.550\nI like it, I like it.\n\n211\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.212\nAnd I think the funny\nthing with these scissor\n\n212\n00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:12.730\ntool is I believe you also always need\nto make sure that you hit on a path.\n\n213\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.329\nSo see right here,\neven though it broke up,\n\n214\n00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:19.424\nit looks like there's a path there\ncuz there's a fill applied to it.\n\n215\n00:10:19.424 --> 00:10:23.048\nBut you see there's not actual path,\nso it's telling me no, no, no, no,\n\n216\n00:10:23.048 --> 00:10:24.760\nno I need it to actually be on a path.\n\n217\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.290\nSo it can get a little bit wonky but\n\n218\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.710\nI feel like that's where\nthat starts to come in.\n\n219\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.470\n&gt;&gt; And you just remind me of why I would\nalways say that cuz you had to cut\n\n220\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.610\non the string,\nyou couldn't cut in the middle of the air,\n\n221\n00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.270\nyou had to cut on the string or\na piece of hair or something like that.\n\n222\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.040\nYay, okay good.\n\n223\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.760\n&gt;&gt; And we all just brought it all back in,\ntied it all together.\n\n224\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.350\nSo yes, scissors tool, it's all just\ndependent on what you're doing and\n\n225\n00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.600\nwhat you feel like you need to cut.\n\n226\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.630\nI think Vonne had a great example.\n\n227\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.229\nIf I need to cut a piece of hair, a piece\nof string, I want to go ahead and do that,\n\n228\n00:10:54.229 --> 00:10:56.865\nso I can go ahead and\nclick here, click here.\n\n229\n00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.885\nAnd you'll start to see it's like, whoa\nit's starting to get a little bit wonky,\n\n230\n00:10:59.885 --> 00:11:01.190\nespecially as I've divided that.\n\n231\n00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.000\nBut now I can see that,\nthat's in three different pieces.\n\n232\n00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.870\nSo, just keep going with it.\n\n233\n00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.492\nMake sure you're always\ncutting along that path.\n\n234\n00:11:09.492 --> 00:11:13.210\nNow I'll go ahead and\nkinda shift this little guy over.\n\n235\n00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.860\nWe'll draw a new polygon\nto talk about our knife.\n\n236\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.050\nSo our knife tool, rather than having\nour start and our end points, or\n\n237\n00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.730\nthe string as Vonne mentioned, you're\nactually going to slice something with\n\n238\n00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.590\nthe knife, which sounds way more dramatic.\n\n239\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.270\n[LAUGH] So what we're going to do, we're\ngonna go ahead and grab our knife tool.\n\n240\n00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.410\nNow our knife tool by default, you're\ngonna kind of want to work in a curve.\n\n241\n00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.960\nSo the funny thing with the knife tool\nthat kind of throws people off in\n\n242\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.520\nthe beginning is that it feels\nlike it gets really wonky.\n\n243\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.120\nIf I just go down here, you'll see\nhow I have kind of a crooked line.\n\n244\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.884\nStill works, I'm just gonna have kind\nof a crooked appearance by default.\n\n245\n00:11:49.884 --> 00:11:53.976\nBut you will see that it maintained the\ncharacteristics of my original shapes, so\n\n246\n00:11:53.976 --> 00:11:55.740\nit kinda filled in for us.\n\n247\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.040\nSo what I say is make sure\nyou're kinda working in a curve.\n\n248\n00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.880\nSo if I kinda click, hold,\nand drag up from here,\n\n249\n00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.150\nif I kinda work in a curve,\nI can go ahead and get that effect.\n\n250\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.960\nNow there is a way to make it straight and\nwe'll talk about that in a second.\n\n251\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.800\nBut again, I just wanna point out,\nnote how the difference between this and\n\n252\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.930\nour scissors where their scissors\ndid not kind of fill in that path.\n\n253\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.340\nIt didn't enclose it in.\n\n254\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.470\nThis is closing our path and therefore\nmaintaining the characteristics of our\n\n255\n00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.370\noriginal shape because it\ncan add that stroke back in.\n\n256\n00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.094\n&gt;&gt; And maybe one thing you are like,\nthat's like what the eraser did.\n\n257\n00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:30.616\nBut the eraser had a diameter that it\nkind of made a swath through, [LAUGH] and\n\n258\n00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:36.770\na knife, there's not space if you want\nto say, in between where you're cutting.\n\n259\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.020\nAnd I always said if you take a knife and\ncut through a loaf of bread and\n\n260\n00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.780\nyou gotta cut all the way down\nthrough the loaf of bread.\n\n261\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:47.060\nYou don't cut halfway through or\nit doesn't become it's own piece.\n\n262\n00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you didn't kind of lose anything\nin there in the middle with that diameter.\n\n263\n00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.222\nYou've got it all perfectly sliced,\nif you will.\n\n264\n00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:58.020\nSo now what if you do want to cut\nsomething in a straight line, okay?\n\n265\n00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.810\nThis one always throws me, I'll be honest.\n\n266\n00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.750\nSo with the knife tool, in order to cut\nsomething in a straight line you actually\n\n267\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.880\nto hold down your Alt or Option key.\n\n268\n00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.930\nWhy does that throw me?\n\n269\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.730\nBecause in everything else you\nhave to hold down your Shift key.\n\n270\n00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.550\nSo pretty much everything else,\nif you're drawing straight square,\n\n271\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.860\nstraight line, things like that.\n\n272\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.420\nSo if I grab my knife tool and\nthen I hold down my Alt or Option key,\n\n273\n00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.000\nyou'll actually see I didn't\nhold it down quick enough.\n\n274\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000\nIf I hold down the Alt or\n\n275\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.878\nOption key, it's gonna make sure\nthat I have a straight line.\n\n276\n00:13:26.878 --> 00:13:32.180\nSo it's not necessarily saying straight\nin 90 degree, but it's a straight line.\n\n277\n00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.588\nSo I can go ahead and use that.\n\n278\n00:13:33.588 --> 00:13:38.005\nNow, what if I want a straight line and\nI do wanna make sure that it's 90 degrees?\n\n279\n00:13:38.005 --> 00:13:39.755\nThat's when your Shift key comes in handy.\n\n280\n00:13:39.755 --> 00:13:42.535\nWhy is this backwards\nfrom everything else?\n\n281\n00:13:42.535 --> 00:13:43.756\nI don't know.\n\n282\n00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:46.358\nBut [LAUGH] I'm gonna hold down my Alt or\nOption key and\n\n283\n00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:48.444\nI'm gonna hold down my Shift key as well.\n\n284\n00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:50.775\nAnd I'm trying to move my\nmouse from side to side,\n\n285\n00:13:50.775 --> 00:13:53.657\nit's basically just doing I\nthink 45 degree increments.\n\n286\n00:13:53.657 --> 00:13:56.570\nNot 90 degrees, 45 degree increments.\n\n287\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.713\nAnd I can ensure that that's a straight\nline and then also 45 degrees, yeah.\n\n288\n00:14:01.713 --> 00:14:03.433\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I ever knew that.\n\n289\n00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:05.159\nI never knew the Alt.\n\n290\n00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:09.000\nI would always do different ways\nof cutting with straight lines.\n\n291\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.670\nI won't tell you how.\n\n292\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.920\nI did not know about the Alt.\n\n293\n00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.170\nAnd to make it go to a whole other piece,\njust to remind myself,\n\n294\n00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.940\nyou do have to go all\nthe way through the path.\n\n295\n00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:26.910\nIf you go halfway, it'll still do that but\nit doesn't make a separate piece.\n\n296\n00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.927\nIt just made a weird compound path thing,\nall right, yeah.\n\n297\n00:14:31.927 --> 00:14:36.030\nThat was another, going back to my\nhad to cut through a loaf of bread.\n\n298\n00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.460\nYou had to cut all the way down\nthrough to get the slice off.\n\n299\n00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.350\nYou've gotta go all the way through\nit to make it come off, so.\n\n300\n00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.772\n&gt;&gt; I think that's the next little thing.\n\n301\n00:14:44.772 --> 00:14:46.490\nThank you.\n\n302\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.730\nAnd excellent, Vonne's always good for\nthe metaphors I feel like.\n\n303\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.980\nIt's excellent, so yeah.\n\n304\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.342\nI'd definitely say,\njust kinda keep swiping.\n\n305\n00:14:54.342 --> 00:14:56.630\nKeep cutting if you will.\n\n306\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.500\nBut remember kind of the slight variations\nbetween that eraser, scissors, knives.\n\n307\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.470\nFor our eraser, it's gonna have that kind\nof diameter, it's gonna pull through,\n\n308\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.650\nit's gonna add those extra points\nin to close our paths off.\n\n309\n00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.330\nAre scissors, not going to close the path.\n\n310\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.808\nPath eraser, just erasing our path.\n\n311\n00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:15.908\nAnd then our knife, kind of similar\nback to that eraser tool but\n\n312\n00:15:15.908 --> 00:15:19.431\nwe're not having that diameter,\neverything is just a clean cut, so.\n\n313\n00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:20.783\n&gt;&gt; So now you can go back and\n\n314\n00:15:20.783 --> 00:15:24.363\nmake all your rock star logos with\nthat cut out part of the star,\n\n315\n00:15:24.363 --> 00:15:28.370\ncuz now I'm thinking of band names and\nall sorts of different things.\n\n316\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.849\nAnd that should indicate\nthat I need to stop.\n\n317\n00:15:30.849 --> 00:15:32.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.250\n&gt;&gt; So why don't we go ahead and\n\n319\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.360\nwrap this one up.\n\n320\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.110\nSigning off for CREATIVE Pro.TV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n321\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.100\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n322\n00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.314\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n323\n00:15:41.314 --> 00:15:45.696\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n10\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.513\nNo no no, actually our shape runner,\nshape builder, I think to Vonne's point,\n\n11\n00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:42.480\ndon't really sound all that exciting.\n\n12\n00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.520\nBut actually, really pretty cool.\n\n13\n00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.250\nSo what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.810\nstart with shape builder which\nis kind of like, I would say,\n\n15\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.330\nIllustrator's more intuitive\nPathfinder panel really.\n\n16\n00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.550\nAnd both of these are actually\npretty new tools that we can use.\n\n17\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.370\nAnd then our shaper tool is just crazy.\n\n18\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.810\nSo, we'll get into that in a second.\n\n19\n00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.810\nSo, I wanna go ahead and\nstart with my shape builder tool.\n\n20\n00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.386\nI always get the names, It's easy to get\nthe names kinda mixed up on this one,\n\n21\n00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:12.070\neven though they do pretty\ndifferent things here.\n\n22\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.940\nSo, you see with my shape builder tool,\n\n23\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.910\nI'm basically just starting\nout with two different shapes.\n\n24\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.350\nAnd what our shape builder tool does,\nis it allows us to combine shapes.\n\n25\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.939\nA little bit more easily than\nagain that Pathfinder panel does.\n\n26\n00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.444\nIf you can think back, if you watched\nthe episode on the Pathfinder panel,\n\n27\n00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:33.974\nyou almost have to click around to\nsee exactly what each option does.\n\n28\n00:01:33.974 --> 00:01:37.671\nThe shape builder tool they said, makes it\na little bit more intuitive because it's\n\n29\n00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:41.090\ngonna be easier to see as we\nare building something and\n\n30\n00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.200\nmodifying things, it's just gonna\nbe a little bit more visual for us.\n\n31\n00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.160\nSo what I'm gonna do, I need to first\nselect these with our black arrow tool.\n\n32\n00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.660\nExcuse me.\n\n33\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.740\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\ngrab my shape builder tool.\n\n34\n00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.880\nMy shape builder tool, I feel like\nI always I'm losing here on my.\n\n35\n00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.985\n&gt;&gt; You're doing exactly\nwhat I do every time.\n\n36\n00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:00.938\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n37\n00:02:00.938 --> 00:02:02.170\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, where is it located?\n\n38\n00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.165\nThere it is.\n\n39\n00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:07.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The icon explains exactly what it does,\n\n40\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.210\nbut it just gets me every time.\n\n41\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.040\nIt's just not that obvious for\nsome reason.\n\n42\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's also from us being\nold school, like the live paint bucket,\n\n43\n00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.830\nwhich is right underneath\nit where it's hidden.\n\n44\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.220\nThat was what that button in that\nparticular space on the toolbar\n\n45\n00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.410\nalways occupies.\n\n46\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n47\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.670\n&gt;&gt; And so I'm always like,\nI don't know why.\n\n48\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.460\nIt's like this weird mental block\nwhere I can't find that tool.\n\n49\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.320\n&gt;&gt; You feel like, you're like, no,\nthat's where my live paint bucket is.\n\n50\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's not right, that's not right.\n\n51\n00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.720\nThey just, poor live paint bucket\ngot shoved to the back and\n\n52\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.140\nthey put the shape builder\ntool on top of it.\n\n53\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.010\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and grab that.\n\n54\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.820\nNow you'll notice I selected these\nwith my black error tool first.\n\n55\n00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.780\nThat is gonna be essential.\n\n56\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.080\nYou can't actually do anything with\nyour shape builder tool unless you have\n\n57\n00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.700\nboth objects selected with\nyour block area tool.\n\n58\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.000\nAnd with your shape builder tool, when\nyou grab that you see you kinda start to\n\n59\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.280\nhover over those shapes you have selected.\n\n60\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.330\nI can have more than one, it doesn't\nhave to just be these two here and\n\n61\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.800\nwe'll show an example of that.\n\n62\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.470\nYou get these kind of like\nmesh things over it, and\n\n63\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.740\nthat's just basically letting you\nknow the area that you're affecting.\n\n64\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.820\nSo remember when I said it's a little\nbit more intuitive cuz you can\n\n65\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.850\nactually see it.\n\n66\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.530\nBy single click to,\nin the space between them.\n\n67\n00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.322\nYou´ll see how it will go head and\nconnect those two pieces.\n\n68\n00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:26.200\nSo now, this is all kinda like,\nsee how it´s breaking it apart.\n\n69\n00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.186\nIt´s almost taking that and it´s\ntaking that into its individual paths.\n\n70\n00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:34.330\nBut, if I take this,\nthat was just a single click.\n\n71\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.392\nNow I´m gonna select those again,\ngrab my shape motor tool.\n\n72\n00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:40.620\nAnd then what if instead of just\nsingle clicking between those two,\n\n73\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.150\nI'm gonna click hold and drag.\n\n74\n00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.510\nAnd when I click hold and drag,\nyou're gonna see it connect everything.\n\n75\n00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.490\nSo now I can tell because that mesh,\nit's all one piece.\n\n76\n00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.330\nNow when I go to my black area tool,\nI have that all as one piece.\n\n77\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.810\nNow I'm gonna command or control Z,\njust go back a couple of times here.\n\n78\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.380\nSo I get kinda my original shapes back,\n\n79\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.620\ncuz I also wanna point out that when\nI'm working, see I'm losing it again.\n\n80\n00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.720\nWhen I see that shape builder tool,\nokay yes,\n\n81\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.640\nyou have the different areas where\nyou can kinda click and connect.\n\n82\n00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.360\nAnd I can even click hold and\ndrag just to here,\n\n83\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.300\nyou know you don't have to necessarily\nclick hold and drag all the way through.\n\n84\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.910\nSo if I wanted something that just looked\nlike that, you can see there are some\n\n85\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.970\nslight differences depending\non where you actually select.\n\n86\n00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.591\nAnd then I can also\nkinda go in the reverse.\n\n87\n00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:27.302\nSo if you think about back\nwith your path finders,\n\n88\n00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:31.566\nyes you have the option to delete things,\nor I'm sorry to combine shapes, but\n\n89\n00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:34.471\nthen you also have the option\nto do like a minus front or\n\n90\n00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:38.660\nsomething like that where you can\nkinda knock a hole out of something.\n\n91\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.480\nSo what if I go into this space here and\n\n92\n00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.820\nyou see how naturally your cursor\nhas that little plus sign to it.\n\n93\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.530\nIf I hold down my Alt or Option key\nit's gonna turn to that minus sign.\n\n94\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.350\nSo if I go ahead and\ndo the same thing again, single click but\n\n95\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.460\nwhile holding down my Alt or\nOption key, its gonna go ahead and\n\n96\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.820\nbasically kinda knock\nthe hole through the space.\n\n97\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.110\nSo that is an additional option that\nyou have with your shape builder tool.\n\n98\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.090\nSo again, we're just kind of combining and\n\n99\n00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.400\nmodifying shapes from their original\nform with our shape builder tool.\n\n100\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.380\n&gt;&gt; And I think again,\nif you hold that Alt and\n\n101\n00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.750\ndo the drag like you had done instead of.\n\n102\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.070\nNormally it's in the unified\nmode if you wanna call it.\n\n103\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.315\nGo ahead and\nbring together with the click, hold, drag,\n\n104\n00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:19.779\nwith the minus,\nwould take all of that out.\n\n105\n00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:24.428\nYet every single one of those\nPathfinder options that are there,\n\n106\n00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:26.080\nyou can do with this.\n\n107\n00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.820\nWith this tool, which like you're saying,\nit is a little bit more intuitive.\n\n108\n00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.754\nThe only thing would be like,\nremember to hold the Alt, to do the minus.\n\n109\n00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:35.225\nBut we've been doing that Alt for\na couple different tools,\n\n110\n00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:37.960\nlike the symbol sprayer and\nsome other things.\n\n111\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.418\nSo Alt kind of naturally, was gonna say,\nit's always the opposite?\n\n112\n00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:43.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or the alternative.\n\n113\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.832\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:45.832 --> 00:05:46.684\nLook at that.\n\n115\n00:05:46.684 --> 00:05:48.467\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You so clever, yeah exactly.\n\n116\n00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:51.265\nYeah so,\nit's going to do the opposite thing, so\n\n117\n00:05:51.265 --> 00:05:53.942\nyou'll see here I did that click hold and\ndrag.\n\n118\n00:05:53.942 --> 00:05:56.610\nAnd that basically did a minus front for\nus.\n\n119\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.200\nSo it's again it's a newer tool\n\n120\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.400\nthat it's not taking away\nthe Pathfinder panel by any means,\n\n121\n00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.052\nbut it's just kind of almost again,\nI hate to use the word intuitive again.\n\n122\n00:06:07.052 --> 00:06:07.715\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n123\n00:06:07.715 --> 00:06:10.880\nit's a different way to do the same thing,\nyep.\n\n124\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.212\n&gt;&gt; I just had a thought of I never\ndid this very well at all, but\n\n125\n00:06:14.212 --> 00:06:17.476\nwhere would you have like the man,\nwhere you draw a man and\n\n126\n00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:22.180\nnose, all of like the circles to indicate\nlike the leg, and the calf and the foot.\n\n127\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.500\nAnd there were all these ovals,\nthat you kind of overlap, right?\n\n128\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.920\n&gt;&gt; You´re bringing me to my next example.\n\n129\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.520\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n130\n00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.505\n&gt;&gt; Are you kidding me?\n\n131\n00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:30.075\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n132\n00:06:30.075 --> 00:06:31.637\n&gt;&gt; We did not talked\nabout this beforehand.\n\n133\n00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:32.562\n&gt;&gt; You're in my mind.\n\n134\n00:06:32.562 --> 00:06:33.062\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n135\n00:06:33.062 --> 00:06:34.162\nThis is crazy.\n\n136\n00:06:34.162 --> 00:06:34.712\n&gt;&gt; Not, not\n\n137\n00:06:34.712 --> 00:06:35.282\na man.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:06:35.282 --> 00:06:36.567\n&gt;&gt; But we're gonna use some circles.\n\n139\n00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:38.602\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay, and then you can just\n\n140\n00:06:38.602 --> 00:06:43.980\nconnect them all together as you draw.\nAll right, wow, crazy.\n\n141\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.270\n&gt;&gt; I'm so impressed.\n\n142\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.540\nI know, I love it, okay.\n\n143\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.100\nSo, yes,\n\n144\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.380\nI wanted to show you guys a little\nbit more of a practical use for this.\n\n145\n00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.800\nNow, I'm gonna full-on be honest with you.\n\n146\n00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.680\nThis is just something that I saw somebody\nelse do, and I was like, it's really cool.\n\n147\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.831\nI wanna go ahead and do that.\nSo you know, I cannot take full credit for\n\n148\n00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:05.090\nthis I guess I will say for\ncoming up with this idea, but I love it.\n\n149\n00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.320\nSo what I’m gonna do I'm gonna go\nahead and create some circles and\n\n150\n00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.630\nI'm gonna go ahead and do no film, and\nmaybe I'll do like a two-point stroke.\n\n151\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.260\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo something that looks like this.\n\n152\n00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.630\nIt's gonna look a little wonky here.\n\n153\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.347\nI'm gonna take this.\n\n154\n00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:23.700\nI'm doing that selection,\nI'm trying to select from the middle.\n\n155\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.740\nI don't have any fill.\n&gt;&gt; It gets you every time.\n\n156\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.329\n&gt;&gt; It sure does.\n\n157\n00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:30.120\nSo I'm gonna take this,\nI'm going to duplicate this over.\n\n158\n00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.350\nI'm going to duplicate this here.\n\n159\n00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.650\nDuplicate this guy here.\n\n160\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.924\nAnd I'm gonna make this\none a little bit bigger.\n\n161\n00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:43.510\nGonna drag it out like that, and\nthen I'm gonna take a line and\n\n162\n00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.190\nI'm gonna put that little line\nall the way at the bottom.\n\n163\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.739\nI'm gonna kind of move that so\nit fits a little bit more below,\n\n164\n00:07:50.739 --> 00:07:51.980\nkind of zoom in here.\n\n165\n00:07:54.656 --> 00:07:55.804\nAnd you're just using your arrow\n\n166\n00:07:55.804 --> 00:07:56.540\nkeys, just-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n167\n00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.345\n&gt;&gt; In case anybody's like wondering,\nyep, arrows, good, your best friends.\n\n168\n00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:01.471\n&gt;&gt; What magic is happening right now?\n\n169\n00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:02.484\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\n\n170\n00:08:02.484 --> 00:08:05.340\nit's just my arrow keys, just to kind\nof shift things around a little bit.\n\n171\n00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.717\nSo see how I got that to kind\nof tuck in a little bit?\n\n172\n00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:09.076\nNice there.\n\n173\n00:08:09.076 --> 00:08:12.567\nAnd so basically I just have four\ncircles and then I have a plain,\n\n174\n00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:16.200\nstraight line here at the very\nbottom kinda connecting those two.\n\n175\n00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.540\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n176\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.540\nI'm gonna use my shape builder tool\nto connect all of these things\n\n177\n00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.480\ninto one shape.\n\n178\n00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.295\nAnd you may be able to kinda guess what it\nis Mom's like, nope, nope, I got nothing.\n\n179\n00:08:26.295 --> 00:08:28.820\n[LAUGH] So what I'm going to do, I'm\ngoing to take my shape builder tool and\n\n180\n00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.940\nI want to drag through all\nof these open spaces here.\n\n181\n00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.280\nSo I'm going to start off with this circle\non the left, and the cool thing about your\n\n182\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.070\nshape builder tool, as you go, you can\nkind of see how it's actually building.\n\n183\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.020\nSo you kind of see how it's being created,\nand I'm going to take these,\n\n184\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.260\nconnect these pieces, drag in here,\ndrag in here and then I\n\n185\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.050\nneed to grab that space in the middle,\nI don't wanna leave that little guy out.\n\n186\n00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.092\nDrag in here, and it didn't work.\n\n187\n00:08:52.092 --> 00:08:56.880\n[LAUGH] I think I failed to\nselect the line at the bottom.\n\n188\n00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.490\nSo that's a key thing there, make sure\nthat you always have everything selected.\n\n189\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.130\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and do that again.\n\n190\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.900\nJust really killed my\ndramatic effect here,\n\n191\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.830\nbut let me go ahead and do that again.\n\n192\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.720\nI can see click, click, click,\n\n193\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.380\nclick and I even noticed as I was dragging\nhere it's like no, something's selected.\n\n194\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.530\nSomething is not working\nexactly as it should here.\n\n195\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.070\nMaybe just because my line is not\nkind of moved up all the way enough,\n\n196\n00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.540\nI'm not quite sure.\n\n197\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.400\nBut we'll see, okay let's go back,\nlet's try it again.\n\n198\n00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.320\nIt happens to us all.\n\n199\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.710\n&gt;&gt; Maybe because it's a line and\nnot a rectangle?\n\n200\n00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.590\nLike it's not a closed path?\n\n201\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.360\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; That's not it?\n\n202\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.730\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, it's just the nature of.\n\n203\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.735\nBeing in this environment.\n\n204\n00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:39.310\n[LAUGH] Nothing wants to\nwork to work with you here.\n\n205\n00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.860\nMake sure that's selected.\n\n206\n00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.950\nI've bumped that up so\nthat it's connected to the two.\n\n207\n00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.935\nAnd I'm going to take this.\n\n208\n00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:47.285\nNope, something is still\nnot working right,\n\n209\n00:09:47.285 --> 00:09:49.890\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; I think I know the shape\n\n210\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.712\nthat you're going for though.\n\n211\n00:09:51.712 --> 00:09:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cloud.\n\n212\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.772\n&gt;&gt; You're going for a cloud.\n\n213\n00:09:53.772 --> 00:09:54.314\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:09:54.314 --> 00:09:57.304\n&gt;&gt; And that example has never once failed\n\n215\n00:09:57.304 --> 00:09:58.803\nme, until today.\n\n216\n00:09:58.803 --> 00:10:01.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] here we are.\n\n217\n00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.260\nIt's not working, but-\n&gt;&gt; If you try at home, make the line, and\n\n218\n00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.550\nif it doesn't work\n&gt;&gt; Well then, you could make a rectangle,\n\n219\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.520\nI don't-\n&gt;&gt; Blame me.\n\n220\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.580\n&gt;&gt; And that was my only thought\nabout the open versus closed, but\n\n221\n00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.740\nyou're saying it doesn't\nmatter if it's a line and\n\n222\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.520\na closed path and an open path, everything\nshould go ahead and blend all together?\n\n223\n00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.930\nMan!\n&gt;&gt; No, nothing!\n\n224\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.735\n&gt;&gt; Why don't you wanna do that?\n\n225\n00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:29.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's life.\n\n226\n00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.440\nWell, in theory it would have\na pretty cool cloud [LAUGH].\n\n227\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.315\nWell just kind of get that.\n\n228\n00:10:35.315 --> 00:10:37.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Blame\n\n229\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.540\nthe person that I said that\nI stole the idea from.\n\n230\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.060\nSo it's their fault right?\n\n231\n00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.940\nOkay we’ll go ahead and move into\nsomething a little more exciting here.\n\n232\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.340\n&gt;&gt; Where did you get the idea?\n\n233\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.120\nYou could go ahead and combine your\ndifferent paths and be able to take it\n\n234\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.440\njust like that man that you could go ahead\nand draw what looks like the muscles,\n\n235\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.084\nconnect it all together and\nthen make like one whole man, dude, thing.\n\n236\n00:10:59.084 --> 00:11:01.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n237\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.117\nOne whole man dude [LAUGH].\n\n238\n00:11:04.117 --> 00:11:04.991\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One whole man dude,\nwhat's next?\n\n239\n00:11:04.991 --> 00:11:09.300\n&gt;&gt; All right yes, now that I failed you\nI'll try not to let you down again.\n\n240\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.560\nSo what I'm gonna do here, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and grab my Shaper tool,\n\n241\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.090\nmy shaper tool is crazy.\n\n242\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.890\nSo what it does is it's going\nto convert gestures into shapes.\n\n243\n00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.520\nSo what I can do I can kinda go here and\nI can kinda haphazardly draw a circle or\n\n244\n00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.510\nthat was maybe more like an oval.\n\n245\n00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.750\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and\nconvert that to a circle so\n\n246\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.185\nit becomes an actual shape and\nI can do a square or woo.\n\n247\n00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:33.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Polygon.\n\n248\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.590\nI'll just pretend I meant to do that.\n\n249\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.618\nI can do a triangle.\n\n250\n00:11:36.618 --> 00:11:40.860\nYou can kinda just go here and draw and\nI believe if you have a touch screen\n\n251\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.800\nenabled device,\nthis is gonna work out well for you.\n\n252\n00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.390\n&gt;&gt; This is back, harking [LAUGH],\nback to flash again.\n\n253\n00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.210\nI know I made a flash reference when\nwe were talking about the symbols,\n\n254\n00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.286\nof where you had, I think it was the\npencil tool, and if you drew it slightly\n\n255\n00:11:56.286 --> 00:12:00.400\nclose to being a perfect circle,\nit would snap to making a perfect circle.\n\n256\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.300\nSo that's what this is, and\n\n257\n00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.110\nthat's kind of like more of\nthe freehand way of doing things.\n\n258\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.715\nWe just wanna kind of get there, and we'll\nmake it get nice and pretty and straight.\n\n259\n00:12:09.715 --> 00:12:10.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n260\n00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.005\nIt's like, okay.\nOkay, I'm sorry Emily,\n\n261\n00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:12.910\nyou can't draw a circle.\n\n262\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS].\n&gt;&gt; We'll just go ahead and do it for you.\n\n263\n00:12:14.595 --> 00:12:17.615\nSo, that's one of the great\nthings about the shaper tool,\n\n264\n00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:20.115\nis the fact that it will convert\nthose gestures into shapes.\n\n265\n00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:23.035\nBut, I think one of the even like\nthe kinda like the cooler things\n\n266\n00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:24.272\nabout the shaper tool.\n\n267\n00:12:24.272 --> 00:12:27.502\nIs how much you can edit within the tool.\n\n268\n00:12:27.502 --> 00:12:31.162\nSo let's say I'm working on this and\nI did not want that oval.\n\n269\n00:12:31.162 --> 00:12:33.412\nLike I meant to make a circle,\nI didn't mean to make an oval.\n\n270\n00:12:33.412 --> 00:12:37.006\nTo get rid of something\nyou just scribble over it.\n\n271\n00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:40.416\nSo miss scribble over it,\nand it's going to delete it.\n\n272\n00:12:40.416 --> 00:12:44.826\n&gt;&gt; I remember this tool now [LAUGH] cuz\nI'm like there's more than just okay,\n\n273\n00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.676\nmake a perfect circle, or\nmake a triangle, or things that like.\n\n274\n00:12:47.676 --> 00:12:49.056\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just couldn't remember it,\n\n275\n00:12:49.056 --> 00:12:50.936\nthat was nope don't want that.\n\n276\n00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:51.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n277\n00:12:51.446 --> 00:12:52.324\n&gt;&gt; Sony, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n278\n00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:55.596\nI'm bringing you back after\nmy cloud example, right?\n\n279\n00:12:55.596 --> 00:12:58.040\nSo not only do we have that, okay.\n\n280\n00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.910\nNope, I don't want that,\nnope I don't want that.\n\n281\n00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.730\nWe can also use that scribble\neffect to combine things.\n\n282\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.720\nSo it's like okay now I\njust don't want this line,\n\n283\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.260\nI don't want that line that's\nkind of separating them.\n\n284\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.510\nSo I'm gonna scribble there and\nnow I've kind of combined them.\n\n285\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.750\nNow you can see when you hover over it,\nthe math is all still there,\n\n286\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.160\nwhich kinda gets into something a little\nbit different with the shaper tool.\n\n287\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.600\nThe original shapes are still there but\n\n288\n00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.190\nit kinda gives you the appearance\nthat everything is linked together.\n\n289\n00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.840\nSorry.\n\n290\n00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.580\n&gt;&gt; So if you wanted to make like another\ncircle on top of that other circle and\n\n291\n00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.350\nnow it's just like floating on top.\n\n292\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.629\nAm I reading your mind again?\n&gt;&gt; You're just-\n\n293\n00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:34.103\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, I'm getting there.\n\n294\n00:13:34.103 --> 00:13:38.306\nI won't screw it up this time [LAUGH].\n\n295\n00:13:38.306 --> 00:13:39.655\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] excited.\n\n296\n00:13:39.655 --> 00:13:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Not the whole.\n\n297\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.949\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nProceed.\n\n298\n00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:46.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Work my way there.\n\n299\n00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.880\nSo yeah, that's kind of cool thing.\n\n300\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.190\nYou can see I'm kinda jumping around\nhere but I can kinda click on this.\n\n301\n00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.800\nKinda like going in the isolation\nmode if I kinda single click and\n\n302\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800\nthen single click again.\n\n303\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.270\nSee when I said that\nmath is all still there?\n\n304\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.660\nIt has not gotten rid of my shapes.\n\n305\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.990\n&gt;&gt; And,\nyou're still on the shaper tool and never-\n\n306\n00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.164\n&gt;&gt; And, I'm still on the shaper tool.\n\n307\n00:14:05.164 --> 00:14:06.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes, nice.\n\n308\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:11.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can move all of this around and\nreally kind of edit it from there so\n\n309\n00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.360\nthat's kind of leading us into the fact\nthat the shapes are alive, they're alive\n\n310\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.380\nfor you so what I wanna to do I will show\nyou two examples, I'm gonna draw a circle.\n\n311\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.930\nOr best circle I can, you're seeing my\ndrawling skills with my mouse here and\n\n312\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.497\nwhat I wanna do here okay I'm going\nto make this a little bit larger so\n\n313\n00:14:29.497 --> 00:14:30.230\nthat we could see it.\n\n314\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.890\nAgain, all doing this in the shaper tool.\n\n315\n00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.630\nAnd that actually flinch and\nwanna go back to the black arrow.\n\n316\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.230\nYou don't have to.\n\n317\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.970\nSee how when I have my\ntriangle selected here?\n\n318\n00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.550\nWith this particular example, with my\ntriangle, I have okay, not my bar in\n\n319\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:48.120\nthe top right hand corner, but I have this\ndiamond near the top right-hand corner.\n\n320\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.800\nThat diamond again is that\nlive shape aspect to this.\n\n321\n00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.920\nSo I can drag this diamond down.\n\n322\n00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.300\nJust click hold and drag it down and\nit's gonna add sides so\n\n323\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.360\nyou can create a I'm gonna say polygon,\n\n324\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.760\nI know it's not a polygon it's got\ntoo many sides, something like that.\n\n325\n00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.300\nAnd you'll see how that diamond\nmoves as you add sides.\n\n326\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.000\nSo if I click on that again,\nokay it's gonna move and\n\n327\n00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.430\nit's gonna be like all the way down here.\n\n328\n00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.930\nI can click hold and\ndrag that up if I want to get rid of them.\n\n329\n00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.370\nSo all the way down's gonna add,\nall the way up.\n\n330\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.380\nYou're gonna get rid of them.\n\n331\n00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.440\nAnd you can see how that works, so\njust really crazy, cool, I think.\n\n332\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.570\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo a similar thing but\n\n333\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.340\nI'm gonna grab my circle tool here and\nshow you kinda the live aspects of that.\n\n334\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.140\nAgain, not leaving the shaper\ntool to do any of this.\n\n335\n00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.700\nI'm selecting it with the shaper tool\nI'm enlarging it with the Shaper tool.\n\n336\n00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.470\nI'm doing all that.\n\n337\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:45.970\nNow, what happens if you ever,\nyou ever wanted to create a Pac-Man?\n\n338\n00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.610\n[LAUGH] We can very\neasily create a Pac-Man.\n\n339\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.980\nSo what I'm gonna do here,\n\n340\n00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.210\nI'm gonna take this circle that's\nkinda sticking out to the side.\n\n341\n00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.300\nIt almost looks to me like that\narea type versus point type.\n\n342\n00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.426\nIt´s kind of like a similar line\nwith a circle outside of it.\n\n343\n00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:02.162\nClick, hold and drag that down.\n\n344\n00:16:02.162 --> 00:16:04.643\nNow you see how it kind of\nseparates that into two.\n\n345\n00:16:04.643 --> 00:16:06.355\nClick, hold, and drag that up.\n\n346\n00:16:06.355 --> 00:16:10.900\nAnd you're gonna see, okay,\nwell, there's my little Pacman.\n\n347\n00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.690\nBut you can kind of envision\nhow this would come in handy.\n\n348\n00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.540\nSo you're trying to do some\nsort of a pie chart example or\n\n349\n00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.310\nsomething you wanna see\nsomething kinda cut out of that.\n\n350\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.360\nYou can use this live shape aspect of this\n\n351\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.190\nto really edit your shapes and\nkinda create some cool things.\n\n352\n00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.020\nSo again, just really one of\nthe fantastic aspects about this, and\n\n353\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.540\nnow again, I want to get rid of these.\n\n354\n00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.590\nI instinctively want to go back to my\nblack arrow tool to delete something.\n\n355\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.710\nScribble, scribble over it.\n\n356\n00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.120\nYou do have to make sure, okay, you see\nlast time I probably didn't get quite\n\n357\n00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.190\nall of it or\nsomething was a little bit off.\n\n358\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:51.910\nYou saw I had to do it again, so just make\nsure you scribble over the entire thing,\n\n359\n00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.510\nor do a really good scribble there.\n\n360\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.054\nSo I wanna go ahead and delete these guys.\n\n361\n00:16:56.054 --> 00:16:57.269\nAnd then I wanna do something else.\n\n362\n00:16:57.269 --> 00:17:02.232\nHave you ever seen the example of a map\nicon where it kinda has that circle\n\n363\n00:17:02.232 --> 00:17:06.640\nwith the hole in it and\nthere's that triangle below that?\n\n364\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.430\nI wanna go through it and create one\nof those with our shaper tool, and\n\n365\n00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.400\nkind of building upon all these concepts.\n\n366\n00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.100\nSo what I'm gonna do here,\nI'm gonna draw a circle.\n\n367\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:22.330\nAnd then I'm gonna draw another circle\non top of it, move this guy around.\n\n368\n00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.500\nSay okay, you know what?\n\n369\n00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.000\nOops.\n\n370\n00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.330\nGonna go ahead and select that.\n\n371\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.790\nMaybe I'll use my arrows since\nI'm having a hard time dragging.\n\n372\n00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.480\n&gt;&gt; Did you have to like write\non the path like the outline or\n\n373\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.490\nthe stroke will call it the upside?\n\n374\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.775\nYou can't go in the middle and grab it.\n\n375\n00:17:37.775 --> 00:17:38.805\n&gt;&gt; You can,\n\n376\n00:17:38.805 --> 00:17:40.745\nI just was trying to grab the path and-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n377\n00:17:40.745 --> 00:17:42.665\n&gt;&gt; I think that's what was\nthrowing me off there.\n\n378\n00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:45.165\nNow you can see, I can grab here,\nI can select from the middle and\n\n379\n00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:47.295\nI can go ahead and move that there.\n\n380\n00:17:47.295 --> 00:17:49.725\nSo I have the option,\nit's not like something you've taken away.\n\n381\n00:17:49.725 --> 00:17:50.377\nNow.\n\n382\n00:17:50.377 --> 00:17:52.597\nWhat if I go here, okay,\nI'm gonna deselect off of that,\n\n383\n00:17:52.597 --> 00:17:55.517\nand I wanna pop that hole through\nthe circle, I wanna go ahead and\n\n384\n00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:58.897\nmake it look like there is a hole in\nthe middle of it, like a doughnut.\n\n385\n00:17:58.897 --> 00:18:02.037\nWhat I'm gonna do here, I'm just gonna\nscribble through the actual hole part.\n\n386\n00:18:02.037 --> 00:18:06.887\nSo now, I have kind of, it looks like\nwe've just created a compound path\n\n387\n00:18:06.887 --> 00:18:09.867\ntype of thing,\nwhere I'm knocking the hole out of it.\n\n388\n00:18:09.867 --> 00:18:11.997\nAnd then now, okay, I wanna go ahead and\ncreate that bottom part.\n\n389\n00:18:11.997 --> 00:18:16.620\nI'm gonna draw a triangle, we're kind\nof an interesting-looking triangle.\n\n390\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.220\nI instinctively [LAUGH] wanna\ngo back to my Blackberry tool.\n\n391\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.800\nIt's like that old school thing.\n\n392\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.460\nAnd then, okay now,\nI'm going to take this up here, whatever.\n\n393\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.620\nMaybe I'll try to make this a little\nbit smaller, to try and align it.\n\n394\n00:18:28.655 --> 00:18:32.140\nOkay, deselect off of that, and then now\nit's like okay to now to combine these\n\n395\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.970\ntwo, all I have to do is, I want to\nget rid of that line, that, you know,\n\n396\n00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.540\nthat's kind of separating that out,\nscribble over that line.\n\n397\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.470\nAnd you can see that that will\ngo ahead and take it away.\n\n398\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.600\nNow I have a little bit going on here,\nyou might be able to see, okay?\n\n399\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.370\nI've got that little bit\nsticking out from the edge.\n\n400\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.770\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nselect this, drag that in.\n\n401\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.950\nIt's all editable.\n\n402\n00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.030\nAll of the math is still there.\n\n403\n00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:59.210\nYour paths are still here, and you can\nsee when I go ahead and select something,\n\n404\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.600\nthis group ,if you will, this little\narrow in the top right-hand corner,\n\n405\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.400\nif you kind of click on that,\nand it'll flip it up,\n\n406\n00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.940\nthat's kind of when you're in your\nmode that will edit your paths.\n\n407\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.310\nI can see okay I can still select\nthat circle that I had originally,\n\n408\n00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:18.140\nit's not really knocking it out,\nit's still all there.\n\n409\n00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.970\nAnd actually no this is transparent,\nit's not like it added a white fill to it.\n\n410\n00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.100\nI could put something color behind it and\nyou would see through it.\n\n411\n00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.050\nAnd then so you can kind of filter\nbetween the two modes of like, okay,\n\n412\n00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:37.030\nI wanna go and edit this part, and then\nversus just playing with the entire path.\n\n413\n00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:42.040\nSo it's really just kind of crazy\nhow it keeps all of those shapes\n\n414\n00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.240\nthere, originally.\n\n415\n00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.420\nCuz that's just not something we're\nused to seeing in Illustrator.\n\n416\n00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.930\nWe're used to things like the shape\nbuilder tool, or the path finder tool,\n\n417\n00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.670\nwhere it's like once you do it,\nunless you Command or Control Z,\n\n418\n00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.870\nyou're really stuck with that.\n\n419\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.930\nBut all of the math and\nthe paths are still there.\n\n420\n00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:00.250\nSo the Shaper tool, I just think,\nis really, really interesting.\n\n421\n00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.820\nCuz again, you kinda start off a bad idea.\n\n422\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.470\nIt's like, okay, converge gestures\ninto shapes, and it's like.\n\n423\n00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.730\nYeah, it does and that's pretty neat.\n\n424\n00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.920\nBut then,\nlook at all the other things that it does.\n\n425\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.080\nAnd all the editing.\n\n426\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.470\nYou know, you saw me trying to go\nback to that black arrow tool.\n\n427\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.360\nAnd, I don't have to do that.\n\n428\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.080\nI have to get rid of that in my brain.\n\n429\n00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.344\nI can do this all on the Shaper tool.\n\n430\n00:20:18.344 --> 00:20:23.023\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if Tanisha had ever cut\nto my camera, I'm over here like this.\n\n431\n00:20:23.023 --> 00:20:25.472\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz again,\n\n432\n00:20:25.472 --> 00:20:28.840\nmore of an old school person like me.\n\n433\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.710\nThis is newer.\n\n434\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:31.610\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; This is not\n\n435\n00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.910\nsomething that's been around for\nvery, very long.\n\n436\n00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.310\nSo we're getting our old patterns?\n\n437\n00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.780\nI would have done all that\ncompletely different.\n\n438\n00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.960\nWith all the compound patterns\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n439\n00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.850\n&gt;&gt; everything just like you just said,\nI would have done it that way, and\n\n440\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.060\nI'm just watching you do that, that shape.\n\n441\n00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.570\nThe first time, I'm like a map shape.\n\n442\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.510\nYou mean like on our phones,\nlike the little map with the little drop,\n\n443\n00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:55.726\nlike the pin [LAUGH] So I was first\nlike where you going with this and yeah.\n\n444\n00:20:55.726 --> 00:21:00.100\nI'm over here in amazement of,\nhow much easier it is.\n\n445\n00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.500\nIt's like, you can have it so much easier\nnowadays than we had it back in our days,\n\n446\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.340\nso I'm very impressed.\n\n447\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.414\nYou got me.\nYou got another moment out of me\n\n448\n00:21:09.414 --> 00:21:11.484\nof just like, wow, that's amazing.\n\n449\n00:21:11.484 --> 00:21:12.412\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.\n\n450\n00:21:12.412 --> 00:21:13.436\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n451\n00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:14.875\nI'm glad we could roll\nit back after the cloud.\n\n452\n00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:17.436\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n453\n00:21:17.436 --> 00:21:18.257\n&gt;&gt; We'll just all forget that happened.\n\n454\n00:21:18.257 --> 00:21:19.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n455\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.520\nWell, that was awesome.\n\n456\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.745\nThank you so much for all of that.\n\n457\n00:21:22.745 --> 00:21:26.875\nI've learned a lot in this episode,\nso I'm feeling good.\n\n458\n00:21:26.875 --> 00:21:28.325\nThank you very much.\n\n459\n00:21:28.325 --> 00:21:30.665\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n460\n00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:32.155\nWe're signing off for CreativeProTV.\n\n461\n00:21:32.155 --> 00:21:33.995\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n462\n00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:34.865\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n463\n00:21:34.865 -->

CreativeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.800\nI'm your host Vonne Smith, and\nthis is Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n4\n00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.230\nIn this episode we're talking\nabout object, no path right?\n\n5\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n6\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.432\n&gt;&gt; Paths transformation.\n\n7\n00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:29.213\n[LAUGH] And here to help us tell about\nall this cool stuff we're gonna do is Ms.\n\n8\n00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:30.640\nEmily Ramsey, hi.\n\n9\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.820\n&gt;&gt; Hello, hello,\nhow dare you mess up objects with paths.\n\n10\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n11\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.318\ncome on\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:38.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Get it together, no, no,\n\n13\n00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:42.446\nVonne and I we're kinda joking, we didn't\nreally know what to call this episode.\n\n14\n00:00:42.446 --> 00:00:46.760\nCuz usually I just call it cool tools and\nthat's how I kinda link it together.\n\n15\n00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.330\nSo, yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.040\n&gt;&gt; And they are cool tools and\n\n17\n00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.130\nso we're gonna show the coolness of them,\nweren't we?\n\n18\n00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And even the last episode,\n\n19\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.130\nif you're watching in order,\nthe shape builder and the shaper tool,\n\n20\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.920\nyou kinda link that all together\nin your cool tool title, so.\n\n21\n00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.387\n&gt;&gt; But I'm really creative with\nthe adjectives, is what we're saying.\n\n22\n00:01:06.387 --> 00:01:08.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we were struggling like,\n\n23\n00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.410\nwhat do we do?\n\n24\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.450\nHow do we not call this cool tool?\n\n25\n00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.225\n&gt;&gt; How?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So that path transformation.\n\n26\n00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:15.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n27\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.720\nSo what does that mean?\n\n28\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.750\nWhat is kind of cool about this?\n\n29\n00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.110\nOkay, so really like we said,\n\n30\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590\nit's just a couple of cool things\nthat you can do in Illustrator.\n\n31\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.840\nNot only that I think may make\nan interesting effect, but\n\n32\n00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500\nalso things that could also make\nyour life easier at the same time.\n\n33\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.010\nSo, I kind of combined both\nworlds in Illustrator.\n\n34\n00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.900\nA lot of times we talk about\nthings that make your life easier\n\n35\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.580\nlike aligning objects and\nthings that look really cool.\n\n36\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.100\nBrings in a little bit of both I think.\n\n37\n00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.330\nSo we are gonna start off with offset\npath, work our way to the width tool,\n\n38\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.330\nand then we'll also do a little bit of\nenvelope distort which is a fun one so.\n\n39\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.770\nLet's go ahead and get started,\nI've given you some examples here.\n\n40\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.950\nBasically what I'm going through here is,\n\n41\n00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.670\nwe're gonna look at an example of how\nI'm using each of these cool tools.\n\n42\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.180\nI'm just totally foregoing\nthe path transformations.\n\n43\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.990\nI'm sticking with cool tools.\n\n44\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.630\nSo I'm gonna show you what we're gonna do.\n\n45\n00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.230\nWe're just gonna kind of follow along this\npath into making each of these things.\n\n46\n00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.838\nSo, I'm gonna start off\nwith our offset path.\n\n47\n00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:23.870\nNow, while were looking at\nhere in my offset path is that\n\n48\n00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.180\nI have several different squares.\n\n49\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.910\nNow, kind of ignore the color.\n\n50\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.060\nI just did the color\nspecifically like that so\n\n51\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.580\nyou can kind of see how you can make\nsomething look kind of fun or whatever.\n\n52\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.550\nDoesn't matter what the color is but\n\n53\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.090\nbasically I have all these\nsquares on top of one another.\n\n54\n00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.460\nWhy is that exciting?\n\n55\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.580\nBecause if you've ever had a shape and\n\n56\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.910\nyou needed just a slightly larger\nversion of the same shape or slightly\n\n57\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.240\nsmaller version of the same shape,\nthat's what offset path does for us.\n\n58\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.310\nAnd you may be thinking, okay,\nwith a square, whatever.\n\n59\n00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.170\nWhat if you had something that\nyou drew with the pen tool,\n\n60\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.195\nor something that looked\na little bit more wonky, and\n\n61\n00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:04.365\nyou just needed a slightly larger\nversion of the same thing.\n\n62\n00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:07.845\nRather than having to kinda go here,\nduplicate it over, and\n\n63\n00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:09.205\nthen use your align tools.\n\n64\n00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:11.445\nYou know how you have to arrange,\nsend it back, bring to front,\n\n65\n00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:13.315\nall that crazy stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:16.035\nYou can do it very easily with\nthis concept called offset path.\n\n67\n00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:18.225\nSo I'll do something a little more fun.\n\n68\n00:03:18.225 --> 00:03:19.205\nI'll do a star.\n\n69\n00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.850\nAnd then what I'm gonna do here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and select this star.\n\n70\n00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.610\nA lot of things that we're gonna be\ndoing today are actually gonna use our\n\n71\n00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.330\nobject menu.\n\n72\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.306\nSo I'm gonna go into my Object menu and\nthen I'm gonna go to Path and\n\n73\n00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:33.645\nthen I'm gonna go to Offset Path.\n\n74\n00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:36.465\nSo path, object path, offset path.\n\n75\n00:03:36.465 --> 00:03:38.205\nNot to be confused with\nan outline stroke which\n\n76\n00:03:38.205 --> 00:03:39.605\nis what we're gonna\ntalk about in a second.\n\n77\n00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:41.345\nThe o's always get people.\n\n78\n00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:44.865\nSo offset path and what you're see,\nit's gonna pull up a dialog box,\n\n79\n00:03:44.865 --> 00:03:47.765\nand basically it's asking\nyou enter in an offset.\n\n80\n00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:52.565\nSo how much larger, or smaller do\nyou want this other shape to be.\n\n81\n00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.385\nYou see naturally it's gonna go ahead and\nmake it in the same color as well.\n\n82\n00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:56.495\nYou can see that in the preview.\n\n83\n00:03:56.495 --> 00:04:00.370\nSo yeah,\nmaybe I want this to be .013 whatever.\n\n84\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.740\nMaybe I want it .08 larger so\nyou get something like that,\n\n85\n00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.350\nsomething that's a little bit tighter.\n\n86\n00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.620\nNow you'll see, if I go ahead and\nhit OK, because I made a larger shape,\n\n87\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.980\nit instinctively went\nbehind my first shape.\n\n88\n00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.460\nNow if I go back and do the same thing\nagain, Object Path, Offset Path and\n\n89\n00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.520\nlet's say I put a negative in here.\n\n90\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.216\nSo, I do a -.08 no, maybe a little\nbit too large, we'll do a -.02,\n\n91\n00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:31.870\nmaybe something like that will\nshow up a little bit better.\n\n92\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.360\nNope, nope, that's too small.\n\n93\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.820\nLet's go back to that .08.\n\n94\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.200\nSo, if I go ahead and do that and\ngo ahead and hit OK, you'll see,\n\n95\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.790\nbecause I did the negative,\nthe negative immediately goes in front.\n\n96\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.470\nSo that's really part of the beauty of it.\n\n97\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.890\nIt takes away the step of, hey,\n\n98\n00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.730\nthey're having to go into your\nlayers panel or use that arrange.\n\n99\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.120\nBring it to front, send it back,\nyadda yadda yadda.\n\n100\n00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.830\nYou can just keep making this larger or\nsmaller as best you can.\n\n101\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.800\n&gt;&gt; The other cool thing is that you\ncan specify a specific distance.\n\n102\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And I want it to be, each one,\n\n103\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.560\na quarter inch away from each other.\n\n104\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.710\nAnd offset all the entire object.\n\n105\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.620\nAnd I love doing this.\n\n106\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.088\nBecause just like the star,\nI would always do it with the star, too.\n\n107\n00:05:13.088 --> 00:05:18.810\nIt's just need to be able to have that\npinpoint measurement of that much bigger.\n\n108\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.070\nAll the way outside of whatever\nthat object is rather than just\n\n109\n00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.200\nhaving to guess.\n\n110\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.930\nWe go ahead and make a number.\n\n111\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's so nice to be able\nto put in that exact dimension.\n\n112\n00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.060\nSo I've lost whatever\nnumber I used before.\n\n113\n00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.660\nI can't remember.\n\n114\n00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.550\nI'm gonna use 0.5.\n\n115\n00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.350\nYou see when I do 0.5 it's\nlike well that's huge but\n\n116\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.580\nyou can kinda see how the example works.\n\n117\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.600\nSo offset path is one of those things,\nyeah,\n\n118\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.080\nyou can use it to make something\nthat looks kind of cool,\n\n119\n00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.000\nand yes, my alignment got a little\noff when I did this smaller.\n\n120\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.920\nOr when I resized it, but\nthat's why you use this tool, so\n\n121\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.970\nyou don't have to be resizing things.\n\n122\n00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:56.850\nLooks cool but\nthen also makes your life a lot easier.\n\n123\n00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.730\nSo I do find that this is\nsomething that I use quite a bit.\n\n124\n00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.080\nI'm gonna go ahead and delete this\ngigantic orange star just cuz it's gonna,\n\n125\n00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.140\nit keeps getting in my\nway a little bit so.\n\n126\n00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.610\nI wanna move on to this wonky little\nwormy guy, peapod if you will.\n\n127\n00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.330\nHow did I go ahead and create this?\n\n128\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.460\nWell, there are kind of a couple of\ndifferent things that go along with this.\n\n129\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.670\nOne thing with our strokes,\nyou may have noticed, and\n\n130\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.780\nthis can work for a closed path or\nan open path, it just has to be a stroke.\n\n131\n00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.620\nAnytime you go and apply a stroke, you may\nhave noticed just kind of next door to\n\n132\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.890\nthat, you see where it says uniform?\n\n133\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.180\nThat's actually our width profile.\n\n134\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.910\nSo your strokes have the ability to have\nthese kind of crazy shapes to it and\n\n135\n00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.140\ncrazy widths to it.\n\n136\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.530\nSo you can see, and I'm increasing my\nstroke weight as I do this so you can.\n\n137\n00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.310\nYou can see how it works here.\n\n138\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.360\nI can go here and I can select okay,\nall of these different widths and\n\n139\n00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.090\nyou get that one, that one looks kind of\nlike what I have on the top there, and\n\n140\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.150\nI can do some really fun and\ninteresting things.\n\n141\n00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.620\nNow you may be saying, okay great,\nwhy are you pointing this out now,\n\n142\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.780\nhow is that really cool.\n\n143\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.940\nAnd how is that really different\n\n144\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.090\nfrom anything that we just did in our\nin strokes, well I can make my own.\n\n145\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.760\nSo what I can do I can go ahead and\ngrab just a plain old stroke or\n\n146\n00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.200\nmay be I'll just take this one back and\nI'll grab it back to uniform,\n\n147\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.360\nI'll start with the same example.\n\n148\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.090\nAnd then what I wanna do is,\nI wanna go ahead and grab my width tool,\n\n149\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.020\nmy width I feel like again the icon is,\n\n150\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.120\ntheory accurate representation of\nwhat the tool does and how it works.\n\n151\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.680\nBut the icon is just hard to explain.\n\n152\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.260\nSo what I would do, if you can't find\nit just go ahead and hit Shift w.\n\n153\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.020\nMine is just underneath my rotate tool, so\n\n154\n00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.210\nit's just under the one that has the arrow\nthat's kinda going like that, so.\n\n155\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.900\nGo ahead and find it however,\n\n156\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.260\nI'm gonna keep kinda hovering\nover here to help you find it.\n\n157\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.670\nAnd then once you go ahead and select it,\nwhat you're gonna do is you are going to,\n\n158\n00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.980\nsee if I just hover over this, I get\nthese little white dots or white balls.\n\n159\n00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.393\nThose are where I can add width points.\n\n160\n00:07:54.393 --> 00:07:59.778\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nsingle click hold and drag on this And\n\n161\n00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:04.330\nyou can see how I can increase\nthe width of this stroke.\n\n162\n00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.410\nAgain, this could be a close path,\nopen path,\n\n163\n00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.170\nI just need to be doing it on a stroke.\n\n164\n00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:13.220\nSo I can go here, And increase and\ndecrease the width throughout.\n\n165\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.008\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and when you say,\nopen path close path,\n\n166\n00:08:17.008 --> 00:08:22.785\nif you had a square that had a stroke\nthen you can do the same alternating or\n\n167\n00:08:22.785 --> 00:08:26.879\nabnormal widths on each\none exactly by doing that.\n\n168\n00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.180\nAnd it can have a fill in and\neverything like this.\n\n169\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.340\nSo just to kinda clarify\nit's not going on the fills,\n\n170\n00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:37.070\nthis is only a stroke,\nit's the width tool for the stroke.\n\n171\n00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.762\nAnd that, that looks kind of interesting.\n\n172\n00:08:37.762 --> 00:08:38.645\n&gt;&gt; Abstract.\n\n173\n00:08:38.645 --> 00:08:40.441\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n174\n00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:41.670\n[LAUGH] It was pretty interesting.\n\n175\n00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.710\nSo\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] But\n\n176\n00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.240\nyou can see here how you can\nkeep going with your width tool.\n\n177\n00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.427\nAnd you can even edit them,\nthat's kind of a nice thing, too.\n\n178\n00:08:50.427 --> 00:08:51.450\nYou're not necessarily stuck.\n\n179\n00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.915\nIf I just select that one back, you see\nhow I don't wanna say handlebars cuz\n\n180\n00:08:54.915 --> 00:08:57.775\nI don't wanna make you start\nthinking about the bezy curves or\n\n181\n00:08:57.775 --> 00:09:00.790\nanything like that cuz this\nis not interacting that way.\n\n182\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.450\nBut I can go ahead and select that back,\nand you see okay I wanna go ahead and\n\n183\n00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.130\njust edit that point or\neven if I wanna delete a point.\n\n184\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.900\nI can go ahead and select it and I can\njust hit the delete key on my keyboard.\n\n185\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.240\nIf I say okay,\nI really wanna get rid of that.\n\n186\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.900\nAnd you can even kinda edit the start and\nend point which I like to your, you\n\n187\n00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.350\nhave the ability to edit those even though\nI didn't actually add a point on the end.\n\n188\n00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.680\nIt will give you the ability\nto adjust those.\n\n189\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.470\n&gt;&gt; Like how much the kind of\ncurving if you wanna say it,\n\n190\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.820\nnow that would go more towards\nthe bezy handles in a sense.\n\n191\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.110\nThey are like,\nalmost like mini bezy handles.\n\n192\n00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.550\nBut yeah, and you can move the individual\nwith one if you wanna move it down or\n\n193\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.090\nup or what have you so\nyou can kinda change\n\n194\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.870\nhow the width is changing between\nthe different width points.\n\n195\n00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.030\nYou can do that so yeah.\n\n196\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:51.530\nIt is fun, it gives a little bit more\nof a flair to your straight line and\n\n197\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.270\nyou can make peapods.\n\n198\n00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.200\nI like the peapods.\n\n199\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you!\n\n200\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.140\nThank you!\n\n201\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.120\nSo yeah, you can definitely\ncontinue to move and edit this,\n\n202\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.060\nwhich is one of the great\nthings about the whip tool.\n\n203\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.670\nIt's just that editability\nthat's built in for you.\n\n204\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.640\nAnd again, it's one of those things, where\nyou see something like this and you might\n\n205\n00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.550\nthink, I have to go to my pen tool to\ncreate something like that, and you don't.\n\n206\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.040\n&gt;&gt; Yet, to remind myself,\nthat with profile that we\n\n207\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.800\ndid up at the top of the control panel,\ncan't you save this as your own?\n\n208\n00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.170\nAm I reading your mind again?\n\n209\n00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.876\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're reading my mind!\n\n210\n00:10:20.876 --> 00:10:22.931\nYou're going to my next step,\nI love it, okay!\n\n211\n00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:24.870\nI get to shoulder shimmy, I'm so excited!\n\n212\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right?\n\n213\n00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.180\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.750\n&gt;&gt; And we have no scripts over here,\n\n215\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.630\nI honestly, she's just going,\n\n216\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.220\nand I just sit here and make my little\ncomments as, can we do that, okay!\n\n217\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n218\n00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.380\nJust good.\n&gt;&gt; Just good.\n\n219\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.690\nSo all we can do, okay,\nwe went through those width profiles.\n\n220\n00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.190\nPart of the reason I went through those\nwidth profiles is just to point out that\n\n221\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.460\nnow that I have this,\nI can save my own width profile.\n\n222\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.270\nSo I can go all the way into\nmy width profile section here.\n\n223\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.560\nAnd if I go all the way down to\nthe bottom, I can click on add to profile.\n\n224\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.580\nSo if I click add to profiles,\n\n225\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.450\nit kinda looks like a little\nbox with an arrow in it.\n\n226\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.120\nAdd to profile so you can go ahead and\nsee with profile 14.\n\n227\n00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.730\nI've added quite a few over the years so\nI can go ahead and add that and\n\n228\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.510\nnow that is something that and\n\n229\n00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.898\nnow, that is something that I can\nchoose to use on, on another shape.\n\n230\n00:11:11.898 --> 00:11:14.960\nNow it's gonna kinda look a little funny\nat first because you'll see okay I don't\n\n231\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.030\nhave the exact same stroke width.\n\n232\n00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.310\nIn order to get this looking exactly\nlike the other one, I need to go and\n\n233\n00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.020\nchoose that stroke width that I had.\n\n234\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.640\nBut you'll see as I increase the width,\nit starts to look more and more similar.\n\n235\n00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.210\nIt is still the same thing,\nit just changes dependent on the width.\n\n236\n00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:35.540\nNow, this is all still a stroke,\nstrokes are great.\n\n237\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.290\nMany wonderful things about them.\n\n238\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.220\nBut every once in a while you\nwanna have something that\n\n239\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.020\nseems a little bit more like a fill,\nright?\n\n240\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.600\nSo you wanna be able to have those\nlittle editable points to it.\n\n241\n00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.580\nThis to me always comes up when I'm\nchanging a lot of colors all at the same\n\n242\n00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.480\ntime, so a lot of times I get frustrated\nif I'm selecting multiple objects and\n\n243\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.180\nit's like, okay,\nI just wanted to make all those green.\n\n244\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.980\nAnd, it's not working because\none's a fill and one's a stroke.\n\n245\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.930\nIf I try and have multiple things selected\nthat, and my own laziness, basically,\n\n246\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.680\nis what I'm getting at.\n\n247\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.260\nSo, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go\nahead and select this stroke and\n\n248\n00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.830\nI can actually turn this\nstroke into a fill.\n\n249\n00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.450\nYou remember outlining your texts?\n\n250\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.070\nYou know how we used to take our texts and\nconvert it to a shape?\n\n251\n00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.610\nI can take this stroke and\ndo basically the same thing.\n\n252\n00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.130\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect one of these strokes.\n\n253\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.150\nThis has nothing to do\nwith my width profiles.\n\n254\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.260\nThis is just totally separate\nconverting it to essentially a fiddle.\n\n255\n00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.370\nSo I'm gonna go to Object.\n\n256\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.570\nAnd then I'm gonna go to Path and\nnow I'm gonna choose that Outline Strokes.\n\n257\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.700\nSo outlining of stroking will convert\nmy stroke into a fill essentially.\n\n258\n00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.510\nSo gotta outline stroke, and\nyou'll see now I have I can go ahead and\n\n259\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.370\nselect this from my black air tool.\n\n260\n00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.260\nI have all those like points\nthat I can edit if I need to or\n\n261\n00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.130\nagain in my example, it's usually just\nout of me to select a bunch of different\n\n262\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.480\nobjects at the same time.\n\n263\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.810\nAnd go ahead and change their\ncolors a little bit more easily,\n\n264\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:01.540\nrather than having to select fills and\nstrokes, efficiency.\n\n265\n00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:06.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit turns a open path into a closed path.\n\n266\n00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.590\nOne was a line, now one's a shape or\nother terminology that you're saying.\n\n267\n00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:16.140\nAnd that now, the blue guy, it could have\nit's own stroke coincide with that because\n\n268\n00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.680\nit's all closed on the editable points.\n\n269\n00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.970\nI use this a lot,\n\n270\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.120\nI remember when I first learn this\ntechnique when I was first starting out.\n\n271\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.559\nI just like, okay, whatever [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah\n\n272\n00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:28.060\n&gt;&gt; I use it a lot.\n\n273\n00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.500\nYeah definitely.\n\n274\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.360\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n275\n00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.980\nSo, you can see how if I still liked\nboth of these you can start to see\n\n276\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.000\nthe difference between the two,\nokay this one has a line through it.\n\n277\n00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.550\nThis is very clearly a stroke I'm\ntied to that bar and this is not.\n\n278\n00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.000\nSo you wanna just kinda make sure to\npay attention to the difference there.\n\n279\n00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.110\nSo with profiles,\nall that really cool come in handy.\n\n280\n00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.060\nSomething that I actually use a little\nbit more frequently though is my envelope\n\n281\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.670\ndistort.\n\n282\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.790\nSo envelop distort, awesome.\n\n283\n00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.080\nIt just makes some crazy things.\n\n284\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.860\nI'm showing you an example\nof how this works.\n\n285\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.240\nBut then I'm showing you example here\nof how this worked on multiple shapes.\n\n286\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.820\nSo I just wanna kind of give you\na practical example of how to use this,\n\n287\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.600\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\nmake some distortions if you will.\n\n288\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.640\nAnd what I can do, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust create a rectangle.\n\n289\n00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.528\nGo ahead and give it a color,\nit doesn't matter what it is.\n\n290\n00:14:17.528 --> 00:14:21.560\nAnd now I\"m gonna go back\ninto my objects menu.\n\n291\n00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.010\nAnd I am going to go\ndown to Envelope Distort.\n\n292\n00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.365\nThe option that I really prefer\nto use is Make With Warp.\n\n293\n00:14:28.365 --> 00:14:31.637\nYou can Make With Mesh,\nyou can Make With Top Object,\n\n294\n00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:35.810\nI think Warp is probably gonna be\nthe easiest and best bet to go with.\n\n295\n00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.230\nSo Make with Warp and\n\n296\n00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.070\nwhat you'll see here is you get\nthese Warp Options that come up.\n\n297\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.960\nSo go ahead and\njust click through a couple of the styles.\n\n298\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.000\nMine started with the style Arch.\n\n299\n00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.330\nThe option that I had displayed\nthere at the top, if I,\n\n300\n00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.930\nI can't scroll back to my example here.\n\n301\n00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.110\nBut that was flag that you were\nlooking at with my little flag icon.\n\n302\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.518\nAnd you can see here, okay, okay and\n\n303\n00:14:58.518 --> 00:15:00.571\nchange the distortion from\nhorizontal to vertical.\n\n304\n00:15:00.571 --> 00:15:06.560\nI can adjust the bend maybe I wanted to go\nthat way, or I can change the distortion.\n\n305\n00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.580\nThis will kind of skew it a little bit\nmore, if I wanna use that example.\n\n306\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.100\nOr you can just be like, you know what?\n\n307\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.100\nThat's okay.\n\n308\n00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.640\nAnd go ahead and leave it like that.\n\n309\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.000\n&gt;&gt; This is reminding me of Photoshop\nwhere they do the text warp.\n\n310\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.020\nOr the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n311\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.520\n&gt;&gt; I think it's text warp?\n\n312\n00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n313\n00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.200\n&gt;&gt; It's the same dialog box with the arch,\nand the bulge, and the flag,\n\n314\n00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.510\nand stuff, if that looks familiar to you,\n\n315\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.870\nif you're a Photoshop person\nthat's where it comes from.\n\n316\n00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.670\nAnd this is on one object, but\nyou could do this with text too,\n\n317\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.430\nwhich is always fun.\n\n318\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Just throwing that out there for you.\n\n319\n00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, you could, which is\nsometimes help me if I'm trying to,\n\n320\n00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.120\nif I have text that I want to\nsit on this for some reason.\n\n321\n00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.884\nLike, Hello, and I want it to kind\nof look like its on top of this.\n\n322\n00:15:46.884 --> 00:15:49.786\n&gt;&gt; I don't even know,\nyou might be able to do it all in one but\n\n323\n00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:53.357\nI usually do it separately object,\nand then I go to Envelope Distort,\n\n324\n00:15:53.357 --> 00:15:56.100\nMake with Warp and\nyou can kinda get that same effect.\n\n325\n00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.852\nNow that's really distorting my text.\n\n326\n00:15:57.852 --> 00:16:00.800\nI'd probably adjust that way down.\n\n327\n00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.622\nBut you could see how you could\nuse that to your benefit.\n\n328\n00:16:02.622 --> 00:16:06.577\nNow, one thing else I wanted to show\nyou here is like okay, I did this,\n\n329\n00:16:06.577 --> 00:16:09.710\nnow what happens when I\nwant to kind of edit it?\n\n330\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.560\nYou can either edit your envelope\ndistort or you can also just go back and\n\n331\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.590\nsay, I just want it to\nbe a different color.\n\n332\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.620\nWhen you go ahead and select this,\nyou need to look at your control bar here.\n\n333\n00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.920\nSo if I go all the way to the left\nhand side, you know how by default,\n\n334\n00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.870\nit's set at edit envelope, that's\ngonna be editing my envelope distort.\n\n335\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.230\nSo what I'm gonna do here,\nI can go ahead here, and adjust the style.\n\n336\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.146\nI really like fish,\nI just think it's cute.\n\n337\n00:16:32.146 --> 00:16:34.895\n[LAUGH] So you can go ahead and\ndo that, you can change that again, and\n\n338\n00:16:34.895 --> 00:16:37.550\nthat horizontal and vertical,\nI can adjust the bend.\n\n339\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.640\nAll of those options that\ncame up in that dialogue box,\n\n340\n00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.750\nI have the ability to change here.\n\n341\n00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.600\nBut what happens if I want to go here,\nand I want to change the color,\n\n342\n00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.630\nnothing's happening, I'm clicking in\nmy swatches and nothing's happening.\n\n343\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.500\nI need to change this to\nnow edit the content.\n\n344\n00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.540\nSo you have to kinda flip back and\nforth when you're editing, and\n\n345\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.158\nthat all comes with these\ntwo icons right here.\n\n346\n00:16:58.158 --> 00:17:01.500\nThe one that looks like the mesh,\nversus the one that looks like a star.\n\n347\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.000\nSo if I click on edit contents,\nyou'll see now I have the ability\n\n348\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.310\nto start changing my strokes and\nmy fills and all that good stuff.\n\n349\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.650\nSo it definitely changes depending\non what you have selected,\n\n350\n00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.820\nyou need to make sure to go back and\nforth, but\n\n351\n00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.250\nit is nice that I don't have to\ngo back into the dialog box.\n\n352\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.168\nI have the ability to change that style.\n\n353\n00:17:20.168 --> 00:17:23.594\n&gt;&gt; And we went back to the edit\ncontent and if you noticed,\n\n354\n00:17:23.594 --> 00:17:27.171\nit looks still like a rectangle\nwhen you clicked on that,\n\n355\n00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:31.441\nbecause isn't this where it's\nusing a clipping mask weird thing?\n\n356\n00:17:31.441 --> 00:17:34.853\nAnd if you don't want this\nany more you can release it?\n\n357\n00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:36.660\nAm I remembering this correctly?\n\n358\n00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.713\n&gt;&gt; Reading my mind.\n\n359\n00:17:39.713 --> 00:17:40.603\n&gt;&gt; My gosh it's happening again!\n\n360\n00:17:40.603 --> 00:17:42.526\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I wanna show what happens,\n\n361\n00:17:42.526 --> 00:17:44.680\nokay, if I decide I\ndon't want this anymore.\n\n362\n00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.820\nWhat happens when I release it?\n\n363\n00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.428\nThat's kind of an interesting\nthing that happens,\n\n364\n00:17:49.428 --> 00:17:53.534\nso if I go to Object&gt; Envelope Distort,\nand I hit Release.\n\n365\n00:17:53.534 --> 00:17:58.507\nWhat you're gonna see is,\nit's basically made\n\n366\n00:17:58.507 --> 00:18:02.860\na clipping mask, but not, if you will.\n\n367\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.544\nI don't know, I don't really\nknow how else to phase that, but\n\n368\n00:18:05.544 --> 00:18:08.701\nit leaves you with that shape,\nin my case it's leaving me with that fish.\n\n369\n00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:11.835\nAnd this kind of ties in to that\nmake with top object option.\n\n370\n00:18:11.835 --> 00:18:14.443\n&gt;&gt; You just took the words\nright out of my mouth.\n\n371\n00:18:14.443 --> 00:18:16.115\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] [LAUGH] I was like,\nI've got to get it out,\n\n372\n00:18:16.115 --> 00:18:16.809\nI've got to get it out.\n\n373\n00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:17.588\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n374\n00:18:17.588 --> 00:18:20.829\nI know she's just lurking in the corner,\nand\n\n375\n00:18:20.829 --> 00:18:23.259\nshe's gonna say the same thing,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n376\n00:18:23.259 --> 00:18:24.610\n&gt;&gt; That I'm about to say.\n\n377\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.708\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, I've got to say it first.\n\n378\n00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:28.267\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you noticed that when we went to\n\n379\n00:18:28.267 --> 00:18:31.708\nthe object and\nEnvelope Distort &gt; Make with Top Object.\n\n380\n00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:34.594\nThat's kinda where this\nall comes into play,\n\n381\n00:18:34.594 --> 00:18:38.592\nI'm not entirely positive that\nthis release option will work.\n\n382\n00:18:38.592 --> 00:18:43.150\nHopefully it does, you can see, yep, okay,\nthat goes ahead and makes that there, so\n\n383\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:47.396\nI don't really have too many occasions\nwhere I need the make with top object, but\n\n384\n00:18:47.396 --> 00:18:48.280\nit is an option.\n\n385\n00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.910\nNow something else I wanted to point out\nto you is that Expand option that we\n\n386\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:52.520\nsaw in there.\n\n387\n00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.149\nSo it's expanding, I know we've talked\nabout in a couple other episodes, but\n\n388\n00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:59.077\nit'll basically break this away\nfrom that Envelope Distort and\n\n389\n00:18:59.077 --> 00:19:01.970\ngive us those paths to work with,\nor those points to work with.\n\n390\n00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.790\nSo if I go to my Object menu,\nI can just go to Object Expand, but\n\n391\n00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.775\nyou'll also see it under Object\n&gt; Envelope Distort &gt; Expand.\n\n392\n00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:14.545\nAnd you'll see now, that kind of takes\naway, you see my control bar changed.\n\n393\n00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:17.981\nYou can see really what I'm just\nlooking at is a group here,\n\n394\n00:19:17.981 --> 00:19:22.330\njust kinda looks a normal path, and\nnow I can edit those points if I need to.\n\n395\n00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.733\nSo that is one other thing\nto pay attention to.\n\n396\n00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:28.270\nNow I'll just show the make with mesh,\njust so we can see it.\n\n397\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.941\nSo I'm gonna take that rectangle again,\n\n398\n00:19:30.941 --> 00:19:33.930\nObject &gt; Envelope Distort\n&gt; Make with Mesh.\n\n399\n00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.469\nIt's almost that Gradient Mesh or\nthe Mesh Tool,\n\n400\n00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:41.850\nexcept you're taking this,\ngoing ahead and hitting OK, and\n\n401\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:47.670\nthen you're gonna use your white arrow\nto kind of mess it around, if you will.\n\n402\n00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.051\nAgain, there have been occasions\nwhen I've used this, but\n\n403\n00:19:51.051 --> 00:19:54.112\nit's not something that comes\nin to play all the time.\n\n404\n00:19:54.112 --> 00:19:58.407\n&gt;&gt; And it's really, yeah,\nwhen you go to the edge of that, and\n\n405\n00:19:58.407 --> 00:20:02.030\nthen you can kinda take where the fish and\nthe flag,\n\n406\n00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:06.341\nthose are predetermined shapes\nif you wanna say or pattern.\n\n407\n00:20:06.341 --> 00:20:10.220\nI'm using all these different\nwords in different contexts here.\n\n408\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.993\nBut now you can see,\nif I wanted to do that fish on top,\n\n409\n00:20:12.993 --> 00:20:16.201\nI would make sure I just grab\nthe mesh points, move them down,\n\n410\n00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:19.677\nchange the Bezier handles to make\nthem kind of curve differently.\n\n411\n00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:22.760\nSo you could see from\nall our other lessons,\n\n412\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.268\nyou could make that exact\nsame fish from the mesh.\n\n413\n00:20:26.268 --> 00:20:27.117\nBut its a lot more.\n\n414\n00:20:27.117 --> 00:20:29.862\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you wanted to go into this pin\n\n415\n00:20:29.862 --> 00:20:34.828\npoint level accuracy and be able to\ncontrol these different envelope\n\n416\n00:20:34.828 --> 00:20:40.242\ndistortions that you wanna do, then\nthat's the way to go and grab a point.\n\n417\n00:20:40.242 --> 00:20:44.832\nGo on your merry way, but I'll probably\njust go with the fish too, and go.\n\n418\n00:20:44.832 --> 00:20:47.366\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] well, it's just fun.\n\n419\n00:20:47.366 --> 00:20:48.749\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's that example.\n\n420\n00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:52.592\nBut I think you can probably see as we're\nkind of looking at these things and\n\n421\n00:20:52.592 --> 00:20:55.030\nlooking back,\nwhy we call these cool tools.\n\n422\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.864\nThey're just interesting things\nthat you can do in illustrator, so\n\n423\n00:20:58.864 --> 00:21:02.711\nI really think they're fun,\nhopefully, you think they're cool.\n\n424\n00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:03.780\nYeah.\n\n425\n00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Have a good time, and learn something.\n\n426\n00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.135\n&gt;&gt; They're cool.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:21:06.135 --> 00:21:07.890\n&gt;&gt; They are very cool.\n\n428\n00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.516\nBut the coolness doesn't stop here, yes,\n\n429\n00:21:11.516 --> 00:21:16.717\nwe have a few more cool tools to\nshow you in a part two, so [LAUGH].\n\n430\n00:21:16.717 --> 00:21:19.447\n&gt;&gt; Yes! [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So we'll be\ncoming back with even more, but for\n\n431\n00:21:19.447 --> 00:21:22.160\nnow we're gonna go ahead and wrap this up.\n\n432\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.760\nSigning off for CREATIVEPRO.TV,\nI'm your host Vaughn Smith.\n\n433\n00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Emily Ramsey.\n\n434\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.680\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n435\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.548\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No no, it is cool.\n\n11\n00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:41.995\n&gt;&gt; It is!\n\n12\n00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:46.431\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so we're gonna kind of\ncontinue on with this theme of,\n\n13\n00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:50.391\nagain, things that you can\nuse to make things look cool.\n\n14\n00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:53.260\nBut then also things that are gonna\nmake your life easier in Illustrator.\n\n15\n00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.775\nSo I'm actually gonna hop back into the\nsame file that we were using in part one.\n\n16\n00:00:57.775 --> 00:01:01.235\nThis will be available to you guys in the\nexercise files, you can even see, okay,\n\n17\n00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:04.065\nI've got those original things\nthat I was working with over here.\n\n18\n00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:06.760\nI'll just scoot ir over to\na different artboard basically.\n\n19\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.799\nNow what were gonna start,\nwe're gonna start of with this example.\n\n20\n00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.072\nOkay you promised me cool, and\nthis doesn't really lookthat cool, right?\n\n21\n00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:17.493\nBut basically, the way that this is\ninteresting is how we got there?\n\n22\n00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:18.438\nSo basically,\n\n23\n00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:22.738\nwhat I need to do is I need to have\na repeating version of the same thing.\n\n24\n00:01:22.738 --> 00:01:25.868\nSo I used circles at the top,\nmaybe I'll use squares here.\n\n25\n00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:33.598\nAnd basically, why I think this is\ninteresting is, if I need several squares\n\n26\n00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:38.995\nin a row the natural tendency is just\nto take your Alt drag or whatever.\n\n27\n00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:42.836\nMaybe use your own line tools to try and\nmake sure that they're all the same,\n\n28\n00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.286\ndistribute, or whatever.\n\n29\n00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:45.273\nWhatever you wanna use.\n\n30\n00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:48.131\nWell, I can make my life a lot easier.\n\n31\n00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:51.192\nSo, what I'm going to do is, I'm actually\ngoing to go into my Object menu, and\n\n32\n00:01:51.192 --> 00:01:52.348\nI'm going to use Transform.\n\n33\n00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:55.003\nWe've kind of alluded to this guy already,\n\n34\n00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:59.249\nif you watched the episode on patterns,\nwe used this to kind of scale.\n\n35\n00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.346\nNow I want to use this to move.\n\n36\n00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:06.224\nSo I'm gonna Object Transform Move,\nand then, okay,\n\n37\n00:02:06.224 --> 00:02:08.708\nthere's a couple key things here.\n\n38\n00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:12.732\nOne, I want to go ahead and\ndetermine where I want to move and\n\n39\n00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.352\nhow much I want to move.\n\n40\n00:02:14.352 --> 00:02:16.590\nIn my case,\nI'm actually just moving horizontally.\n\n41\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.695\nYou can see right here we\ncould also move vertically.\n\n42\n00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:22.617\nI think it picks up on\nthe last motion that you did.\n\n43\n00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:26.198\nI think I dragged this down a little bit,\nI don't know.\n\n44\n00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:28.780\nYou can go ahead and\njust type in whatever you want.\n\n45\n00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.772\nMaybe I wanna move this by 0.3 inches.\n\n46\n00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:34.995\nWe'll see if that's enough,\nnope, maybe 0.5.\n\n47\n00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:38.217\nThat's where your preview comes in handy,\nwhich is 0.8.\n\n48\n00:02:38.217 --> 00:02:39.934\n&gt;&gt; This also might be\na little bit with your math.\n\n49\n00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:44.061\nIf you knew that your square was exactly\nhalf inch wide, or whatever, and\n\n50\n00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:45.337\nI need to move it over.\n\n51\n00:02:45.337 --> 00:02:49.764\nYou need to make sure it goes more than\nhalf inch, if it's gonna go past it.\n\n52\n00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:51.912\nBut we didn't wanna go with the math.\n\n53\n00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:55.275\nUntil it's visually moves over,\nturn on that preview and you're good.\n\n54\n00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.732\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm visual person.\n\n55\n00:02:56.732 --> 00:02:58.696\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In case we haven't all figure it out\n\n56\n00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:01.366\nhere, so what I'm going to do,\nI'm gonna stick with 0.6.\n\n57\n00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:01.983\nLooks good enough.\n\n58\n00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:06.798\nNow, absolute most essential part of this,\nyou can hit OK, that's great,\n\n59\n00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:11.336\nthat's going to work, but then it's\nonly going to move this one thing.\n\n60\n00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:14.194\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit Copy.\n\n61\n00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.793\nCopy is where the magic and\nthe cool factor comes in.\n\n62\n00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:18.334\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and hit Copy.\n\n63\n00:03:18.334 --> 00:03:24.411\nAnd then now, I can use the keyboard\nshortcut Cmd or Ctrl+D, D as in dog.\n\n64\n00:03:24.411 --> 00:03:28.583\nAnd I can just do this over, and over,\nand over again until my heart's content.\n\n65\n00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.584\nSo, you do it once and\nthen the work is all done for you.\n\n66\n00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:33.893\nWe know that they're\nperfectly spaced apart.\n\n67\n00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:36.792\nIt's repeating the exact same thing, and\n\n68\n00:03:36.792 --> 00:03:41.944\nI don't have to do any of the effort\nof duplicating, trying to align these,\n\n69\n00:03:41.944 --> 00:03:45.585\nusing your measure tool,\nusing your align options.\n\n70\n00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:46.980\nIt's just all don in Transform.\n\n71\n00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.615\nSo really just kind of one of\nthose huge time saver things.\n\n72\n00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:53.522\nNow I want to go in and\nI want to do something similar here.\n\n73\n00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:57.979\nAnd the funny thing is, these two things\nactually use something very similar to\n\n74\n00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.852\nwhat we just did with our circle.\n\n75\n00:03:59.852 --> 00:04:02.488\nSo even though this in\nparticular looks really crazy,\n\n76\n00:04:02.488 --> 00:04:05.023\nit's really not all that\ndifferent of a technique.\n\n77\n00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:08.106\nSo that's, again,\nwhere the cool factor comes in.\n\n78\n00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:10.236\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna start off with this example here\n\n79\n00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:17.122\nI'm gonna take just a line, I'm just\ndoing a stroke Go ahead give it a color.\n\n80\n00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:20.857\nAnd what I want to do,\nI want to do Object Transform again.\n\n81\n00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:23.825\nBut this time, I want to go\ndown to Object Transform Each.\n\n82\n00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:28.184\nI want each to go by a certain degree,\nor in a certain way.\n\n83\n00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.913\nSo I basically want it\nto keep transforming.\n\n84\n00:04:30.913 --> 00:04:34.688\nSo I'm gonna to go to Object Transform,\nTransform Each, and\n\n85\n00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:38.406\nthen what I am gonna do here,\nI'm just gonna pick my rotate.\n\n86\n00:04:38.406 --> 00:04:42.161\nSo yes, you can do Scale, yes you can\ndo Move, I'm just gonna go to Rotate,\n\n87\n00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:43.648\njust to mix it up a little bit.\n\n88\n00:04:43.648 --> 00:04:46.732\nAnd maybe I'll rotate it by 342 degrees.\n\n89\n00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:49.963\nNow I wanna do the same thing,\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Copy.\n\n90\n00:04:49.963 --> 00:04:54.929\nCopy is where the magic comes in,\ndon't forget, don't hit OK, hit Copy,\n\n91\n00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:59.832\nCmd or Ctrl+ D, and it's going to go\nall the way around that circle for me.\n\n92\n00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:04.633\nSo I can kind of just repeat that\nall the way around, fun one.\n\n93\n00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:06.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love this one, and\n\n94\n00:05:06.246 --> 00:05:10.116\nthis exact example that I've\nprobably been teaching for years.\n\n95\n00:05:10.116 --> 00:05:13.895\nAnd that Ctrl+D, it's Transform,\nagain, it's in that Object menu.\n\n96\n00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:15.692\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; In the Object Transform,\n\n97\n00:05:15.692 --> 00:05:17.363\nit's right there at the top.\n\n98\n00:05:17.363 --> 00:05:19.875\nSo just in case you're wondering\nwhere did that come from.\n\n99\n00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:23.331\nIt's just saying anything you did\na transformation, any of these things,\n\n100\n00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:27.273\nthe Move, the Rotate, the Transform Each,\nwhich really just kind of puts everything\n\n101\n00:05:27.273 --> 00:05:29.435\ntogether, you just go ahead and\nnow repeat it.\n\n102\n00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:33.569\nAnd that's pretty cool, cuz I love\nmaking star bursts as well, and so\n\n103\n00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.561\nmy next step I would take all of these,\nI would then outline stroke,\n\n104\n00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:39.539\nwhich we did in the last episode.\n\n105\n00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.121\nAnd then I would probably go to the\nPathfinder panel and then combine them.\n\n106\n00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:47.746\nSo then it is Union, I think it's Union-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:51.420\n&gt;&gt; And then take that, so\nnow it is one shape, but\n\n108\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.430\nI made it from one line,\ntransform, expand, and then union.\n\n109\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n110\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.509\n&gt;&gt; So, just in case you were wondering,\nthat's what I would do.\n\n111\n00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:00.158\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n112\n00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:03.751\n&gt;&gt; Again, just making your life easier,\nthat's really all it comes down to.\n\n113\n00:06:03.751 --> 00:06:08.553\nSo, now we're gonna use basically the same\nmethod to create this just wild and\n\n114\n00:06:08.553 --> 00:06:09.770\ncrazy thing.\n\n115\n00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.806\nAnd we don't really need to make this,\nI'm just doing it so\n\n116\n00:06:11.806 --> 00:06:13.740\nthat you can see kinda the cool\nthings you can do with it.\n\n117\n00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.354\nI need to bump up my cool factor here,\nlive up to the name.\n\n118\n00:06:16.354 --> 00:06:20.089\nSo let me go ahead and do the Star tool.\n\n119\n00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:22.447\nAnd then what I want to do,\njust so I can see this,\n\n120\n00:06:22.447 --> 00:06:25.799\npart of where this comes in is the fact\nthat I have a gradient applied.\n\n121\n00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:28.180\nSo you can if I just kind of\nselect one of these stars,\n\n122\n00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.765\nthere's a subtle gradient to it.\n\n123\n00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:33.444\nSo I need to jump into my Gradient\npanel real quick, just go ahead and\n\n124\n00:06:33.444 --> 00:06:35.201\napply a gradient there, okay.\n\n125\n00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:37.684\nFine, I can just go ahead and\nstick with that, doesn't matter.\n\n126\n00:06:37.684 --> 00:06:41.286\nAnd I'm gonna make this a little bit\nsmaller, or maybe I'll make it big.\n\n127\n00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:43.615\nNo, I'm doing the other one,\nlet me make it bigger.\n\n128\n00:06:43.615 --> 00:06:46.957\nSo I'm gonna start with big, then I'm\ngonna go to Object, Transform, and\n\n129\n00:06:46.957 --> 00:06:48.749\nthen I'm gonna choose Transform Each.\n\n130\n00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:51.276\nSo I'm just starting off\nwith the same method here.\n\n131\n00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:56.040\nNow the only real difference here is that\nI'm gonna combine two different things, so\n\n132\n00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.961\nI'm gonna combine both a scale and\na rotate with it.\n\n133\n00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.274\nSo I'm gonna scale this back by 90%.\n\n134\n00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:06.999\nI'm gonna make sure that my horizontal and\nvertical scales are the same, just so\n\n135\n00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:09.283\nI know that it is gonna\nscale proportionally.\n\n136\n00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:13.340\nThen, I'm gonna go ahead and\nadjust that rotate, so\n\n137\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.040\nmaybe I wanted to rotate by,\nI don't know, 332 degrees.\n\n138\n00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.377\nSo we'll go ahead and go with that.\n\n139\n00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:23.545\nAgain, I'm gonna hit Copy,\nthat's the key thing, Copy.\n\n140\n00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:27.577\nAnd then Cmd or Ctrl+D, or if you wanna go\nto your Object menu, Object, Transform,\n\n141\n00:07:27.577 --> 00:07:30.726\nTransform again, as Vaughn was saying,\nthat's also an option.\n\n142\n00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:36.741\nSo Cmd or Ctrl+D, and just keep going,\nand you got this crazy little flower.\n\n143\n00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:41.644\nSo, simple, looks like it's really\ncomplicated, actually very simple to make.\n\n144\n00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:45.182\n&gt;&gt; And on this one, I'd probably go ahead\nand grab this all and make a symbol.\n\n145\n00:07:45.182 --> 00:07:49.347\nAnd then once I have a symbol, I then can\ngo all, and then make the symbol sprayer.\n\n146\n00:07:49.347 --> 00:07:50.059\n&gt;&gt; Just genius.\n\n147\n00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:50.953\n&gt;&gt; Combing it all together for you.\n\n148\n00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:52.227\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n149\n00:07:52.227 --> 00:07:55.440\nanything that kind of makes\nthings all into one, I think, or\n\n150\n00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.227\nmakes it act as a single unit is gonna\nmake your life a little bit easier.\n\n151\n00:07:59.227 --> 00:08:00.290\nI like that, I like the symbol.\n\n152\n00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.022\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n153\n00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:04.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All righty, so moving right along,\n\n154\n00:08:04.278 --> 00:08:06.791\nwe're gonna go ahead and make a sun.\n\n155\n00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:11.389\nYay, sunshiny, and something simple or\nsomething similar here.\n\n156\n00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:13.667\nBasically all just using my Rotate tool.\n\n157\n00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.930\nSo what I wanna do,\nI'm gonna go ahead and grab a circle.\n\n158\n00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:23.249\nWe'll take off that gradient there,\nand then your Rotate tool,\n\n159\n00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:27.441\nnow your rotate tool could basically\njust be used to rotate a shape.\n\n160\n00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:31.459\nOr we can also do some kinda interesting\nthings with it, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n161\n00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:33.244\ngrab this, I'm gonna do a stroke.\n\n162\n00:08:33.244 --> 00:08:34.648\nNow what I wanna make sure,\n\n163\n00:08:34.648 --> 00:08:37.896\nbecause I have two options right here,\nor two objects rather.\n\n164\n00:08:37.896 --> 00:08:42.311\nI need to make sure that I have the object\nthat I want to rotate selected.\n\n165\n00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:44.407\nSo make sure that you have, in my case,\n\n166\n00:08:44.407 --> 00:08:47.474\nthe line selected if you wanna\ngo ahead and make this sun.\n\n167\n00:08:47.474 --> 00:08:51.914\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\ngrab that rotate tool, by default,\n\n168\n00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:57.029\nyou will notice that the rotate tool has\nthe axes in the center of that line.\n\n169\n00:08:57.029 --> 00:09:00.082\nThat's because it naturally wants\nto rotate around the center of\n\n170\n00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:01.532\nthe line that we have created.\n\n171\n00:09:01.532 --> 00:09:03.782\n&gt;&gt; The center of that line,\nmaybe zoom in a few bumps.\n\n172\n00:09:03.782 --> 00:09:06.306\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; As I was thinking, I'm going to have to\n\n173\n00:09:06.306 --> 00:09:09.494\ndo that crazy zoom tool that I\ncan't never remember how to use.\n\n174\n00:09:09.494 --> 00:09:13.629\nYes, so you see it's teal,\nso it's kind of hard to see.\n\n175\n00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:18.419\nMay even change the stroke color here,\nso we can see it a little bit better.\n\n176\n00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:20.805\nMm, yellow, nope.\n\n177\n00:09:20.805 --> 00:09:22.534\nSomething darker maybe, yes.\n\n178\n00:09:22.534 --> 00:09:24.297\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's in the middle though of\n\n179\n00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:27.005\nthat selected object,\nbecause, like you said,\n\n180\n00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:29.394\nby default it wants to\nfind the center of it.\n\n181\n00:09:29.394 --> 00:09:32.196\nAnd then you're gonna move and\nrotate around, but\n\n182\n00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:34.205\nI know where you're going,\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n183\n00:09:34.205 --> 00:09:36.422\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna rotate around something\n\n184\n00:09:36.422 --> 00:09:38.837\nelse, so we are gonna rotate\naround the center of this circle.\n\n185\n00:09:38.837 --> 00:09:41.850\nSo what I need to do is,\nI need to move that point of access,\n\n186\n00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.705\nI need to move that rotation point.\n\n187\n00:09:43.705 --> 00:09:48.001\nSo what I'm gonna do is, I'm going to\nsingle click in the center of my circle,\n\n188\n00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:51.792\nyou can even see the smart guide's\ncoming in handy, it says center.\n\n189\n00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.119\n&gt;&gt; All I have to do is click?\n\n190\n00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:56.357\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Really, I've been dragging it,\n\n191\n00:09:56.357 --> 00:10:02.670\njust taking the orientation point and\ndragging it down and trying to find it.\n\n192\n00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:03.691\n&gt;&gt; That's funny.\n\n193\n00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:07.017\n&gt;&gt; Just click, that's all I had to do.\n\n194\n00:10:07.017 --> 00:10:09.294\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You got your own way of doing things.\n\n195\n00:10:09.294 --> 00:10:11.580\nThat's one of the things\nthat I enjoy about this,\n\n196\n00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.447\nis even if you're a seasoned Illustrator\nuser, seeing somebody doing something in\n\n197\n00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:18.288\na different way always illuminates-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n198\n00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:19.232\n&gt;&gt; I never knew I could do that.\n\n199\n00:10:19.232 --> 00:10:23.056\nSo now that I moved my point of access\nby single clicking, or dragging,\n\n200\n00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:24.411\nwhatever you want to do.\n\n201\n00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:28.026\nI'm going to go ahead and\nrotate this around, so what I want to do,\n\n202\n00:10:28.026 --> 00:10:31.723\nI want to Alt + drag, cause I'm\ngonna duplicate this around here.\n\n203\n00:10:31.723 --> 00:10:36.046\nSo I'm gonna Alt + drag around, and then\nI need to drag it all the way around, and\n\n204\n00:10:36.046 --> 00:10:37.903\njust kind of drop it about how far.\n\n205\n00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:40.773\nAnd I see Vonne's like what is she doing,\n\n206\n00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:45.529\nabout how far apart I want each of\nmy little sunshine rays to go apart.\n\n207\n00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:48.826\nSo let me go ahead and drop it here,\nagain, I've held down Alt or\n\n208\n00:10:48.826 --> 00:10:50.365\nOption key this entire time.\n\n209\n00:10:50.365 --> 00:10:53.812\nYou can see I'm duplicating,\nI have that in my cursor.\n\n210\n00:10:53.812 --> 00:10:58.808\nNow once I go ahead and\ndrop it I can Cmd or\n\n211\n00:10:58.808 --> 00:11:03.206\nCtrl+D all the way around my sun.\n\n212\n00:11:03.206 --> 00:11:05.604\nA blue and green sun,\nbut a sun nevertheless.\n\n213\n00:11:05.604 --> 00:11:06.373\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:11:06.373 --> 00:11:08.379\n&gt;&gt; My what?\n\n215\n00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:11.023\nYou went all the way to the left,\nand then when this way,\n\n216\n00:11:11.023 --> 00:11:14.745\nI would have just gone to the right, and\nthen duplicated all around, so good.\n\n217\n00:11:14.745 --> 00:11:17.385\nI was like,\nshe's gonna show me something new, again?\n\n218\n00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:20.241\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, as I was thinking it,\n\n219\n00:11:20.241 --> 00:11:22.729\nI bet you could just go to the right\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n220\n00:11:22.729 --> 00:11:24.994\n&gt;&gt; I'll bet you don't have to.\n\n221\n00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:27.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just always the way I've done it, so\n\n222\n00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:28.347\nwhatever, to each his own.\n\n223\n00:11:28.347 --> 00:11:32.177\nAnd the funny thing about this one,\nalmost never in this example when\n\n224\n00:11:32.177 --> 00:11:36.354\nI draw something do those lines actually\ncome out kind of perfect looking.\n\n225\n00:11:36.354 --> 00:11:40.844\nNormally when you do this you get\nsomething, we'll see if I can do it here,\n\n226\n00:11:40.844 --> 00:11:45.075\nyou get something where your lines\nkind of overlap there at the end,.\n\n227\n00:11:45.075 --> 00:11:47.343\nSo if I do this,\nI'm just gonna do this my own way,\n\n228\n00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:50.653\neven if I could just go to the right,\nI'm gonna go all the way to the left.\n\n229\n00:11:50.653 --> 00:11:52.254\nYou get kind of a weird one, yes.\n\n230\n00:11:52.254 --> 00:11:55.228\nOkay, I was like, screw it up, come on!\n\n231\n00:11:55.228 --> 00:11:56.892\nThe one time you want\nsomething to mess up.\n\n232\n00:11:56.892 --> 00:11:58.909\n&gt;&gt; I'm like,\nhow did she do that perfectly,\n\n233\n00:11:58.909 --> 00:12:01.778\nbecause any time I would teach\nthis it would always overlap.\n\n234\n00:12:01.778 --> 00:12:06.165\nAnd I had to say, okay, now if I got\nmy math right, how many I want, no.\n\n235\n00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:07.012\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n236\n00:12:07.012 --> 00:12:09.257\n&gt;&gt; There wasn't any special trick\nyou just magically stumbled on it?\n\n237\n00:12:09.257 --> 00:12:11.477\n&gt;&gt; I just magically-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n238\n00:12:11.477 --> 00:12:12.996\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just that good.\n\n239\n00:12:12.996 --> 00:12:16.849\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what we're gonna do here,\n\n240\n00:12:16.849 --> 00:12:19.749\nokay, if something like that happens and\nyou want to ensure\n\n241\n00:12:19.749 --> 00:12:23.288\nthat it doesn't It's not something\nyou can necessarily fix at the end.\n\n242\n00:12:23.288 --> 00:12:27.919\nBut I can set this up in a way to\nknow that it's gonna work perfectly.\n\n243\n00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:30.271\nSo what I wanna do,\nI'm setting up the exact same way.\n\n244\n00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:33.057\nI have that line selected\nwith my black arrow.\n\n245\n00:12:33.057 --> 00:12:36.594\nNow I'm gonna go into my Rotate tool,\nand now I'm gonna Alt or\n\n246\n00:12:36.594 --> 00:12:39.193\nOption+click on the center of that circle.\n\n247\n00:12:39.193 --> 00:12:42.283\nSo same way I was gonna\nmove my rotation point.\n\n248\n00:12:42.283 --> 00:12:45.743\nI'm gonna, whoops I'm gonna Alt or\nOption+click there.\n\n249\n00:12:45.743 --> 00:12:48.507\nNow I clicked it once,\nokay, we can go back to it.\n\n250\n00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:54.391\nI'm gonna Alt or Option+click as\nI am moving that rotation point.\n\n251\n00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:57.643\nSo see that little TL thing that I\nmoved to the center of my circle,\n\n252\n00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:59.967\nas I'm doing that I'm Alt or Option+click.\n\n253\n00:12:59.967 --> 00:13:02.474\nNow this is where the math comes in.\n\n254\n00:13:02.474 --> 00:13:05.406\nSo we're really pulling\ninto some geometry here.\n\n255\n00:13:05.406 --> 00:13:08.006\nCircle is 360 degrees, right?\n\n256\n00:13:08.006 --> 00:13:13.369\nI have 360 degrees and then I want\nmaybe 12 lines to go around it.\n\n257\n00:13:13.369 --> 00:13:17.682\nSo 360 divided by 12, Copy,\n\n258\n00:13:17.682 --> 00:13:22.301\nhit Copy, don't hit OK, hit Copy.\n\n259\n00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.824\nCmd or Ctrl+D all the way around, and\n\n260\n00:13:25.824 --> 00:13:31.017\nthat way you ensure that you\nhave a perfect rotation so.\n\n261\n00:13:31.017 --> 00:13:37.682\n&gt;&gt; Omg, I don't even know what to say,\nI've never seen that.\n\n262\n00:13:37.682 --> 00:13:40.118\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; I've never ever seen that.\n\n263\n00:13:40.118 --> 00:13:43.986\nI've never seen the Alt+Click on\nthe rotation orientation thing.\n\n264\n00:13:43.986 --> 00:13:46.873\nAnd I would never have thought to do,\nlet's divide.\n\n265\n00:13:46.873 --> 00:13:52.443\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Complete.\n\n266\n00:13:52.443 --> 00:13:55.637\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to lean on me for\nthe math example.\n\n267\n00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:57.304\nI'm not normally the one to go that route.\n\n268\n00:13:57.304 --> 00:14:02.385\nBut, yes, you can actually do that, you\ncan do the math and kinda determine that.\n\n269\n00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:06.073\nNow, I have this example up here,\nit's basically the same thing.\n\n270\n00:14:06.073 --> 00:14:12.017\nAll I did, I kinda created a circle and\nthen just moved the rotation\n\n271\n00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:17.017\npoint over here, maybe Alt or\nOption+click as I do it.\n\n272\n00:14:18.616 --> 00:14:26.008\nThere we go, 360 divided by 7, I don't\nknow, I'm just picking a number at random.\n\n273\n00:14:26.008 --> 00:14:29.346\nCopy, and you can just do\nthat to your heart's content.\n\n274\n00:14:29.346 --> 00:14:30.835\n&gt;&gt; Gosh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:14:30.835 --> 00:14:32.451\n&gt;&gt; Vonne's gonna do it all afternoon long.\n\n276\n00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:34.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:36.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I had no idea.\n\n278\n00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.777\nSo I've taught this lesson a whole bunch\nof times, for years, and years, and years.\n\n279\n00:14:39.777 --> 00:14:41.340\nI had no idea about that.\n\n280\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.763\nI'm so impressed, and I feel so cool.\n\n281\n00:14:45.763 --> 00:14:49.139\nYou definitely brought the cool factor and\n\n282\n00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:53.556\nyou knocked it up,\nyou knocked it out of the park for me.\n\n283\n00:14:53.556 --> 00:14:56.247\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm so excited.\n\n284\n00:14:56.247 --> 00:14:57.335\n&gt;&gt; As long as I can bring the cool,\nthat's all I live for.\n\n285\n00:14:57.335 --> 00:15:00.862\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well you have accomplished your\n\n286\n00:15:00.862 --> 00:15:05.763\nmission, and I think we've\naccomplished our mission of showing\n\n287\n00:15:05.763 --> 00:15:10.228\nyou all the cool path transformations,\nAKA, cool tools.\n\n288\n00:15:10.228 --> 00:15:11.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But thank you so much for that.\n\n289\n00:15:11.915 --> 00:15:14.447\nBut this is the time that\nwe're gonna wrap it on up.\n\n290\n00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:16.518\nSigning off for CreativePro.TV.\n\n291\n00:15:16.518 --> 00:15:17.608\nI've been your host, Vaughn Smith.\n\n292\n00:15:17.608 --> 00:15:18.552\n&gt;&gt;

--> 00:00:15.500\nwelcome back to another exciting\nedition of Creative Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.170\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and we're\ncontinuing on with Illustrator CC 2017.\n\n6\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.858\nAnd today, my fave, we're gonna talk about\nlive trace, image trace, live paint.\n\n7\n00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:28.918\nAnd they haven't switched those\nnames on me just yet, but\n\n8\n00:00:28.918 --> 00:00:30.650\nyou know what,\nI'm sure they will eventually.\n\n9\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.050\nAnd here to help is Ms. Emily Ramsey.\n\n10\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.514\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt; Are you excited?\n\n11\n00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:36.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm so excited.\n\n12\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.608\nWhatever they're called I'm excited,\nyou know?\n\n13\n00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:39.694\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n14\n00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:42.090\n&gt;&gt; This should be kind of\na fun one I think, yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.990\nSo what we're going to be doing,\nat least to get started.\n\n16\n00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.570\nWe're gonna start with our image trace.\n\n17\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.260\nImage trace is awesome.\n\n18\n00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.320\nSo we've been talking about how when you\nplace an image into Illustrator that it's\n\n19\n00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.630\nstill raster based information, correct?\n\n20\n00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.410\nEven though it's in a vector\nfile it's still an image.\n\n21\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.760\nWell, what happens if you wanna\nconvert that image into a vector?\n\n22\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.220\n[SOUND] That is possible, everybody.\n\n23\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.510\nSo what we're gonna do,\nlet's go ahead and jump right in.\n\n24\n00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.640\nAnd then what we're gonna start with,\nwe work on later gonna use for\n\n25\n00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.670\nour live paint, so\nI'll get to that one in a second.\n\n26\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.140\nFor this, for image trace,\nobviously I need to go ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.420\nstart out with an image.\n\n28\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.200\nNow, my recommendation to\nyou is usually to pick\n\n29\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.380\nan image that is a little bit simpler.\n\n30\n00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.400\nI think one of the best uses for our image\ntrace tool is if you are someone who\n\n31\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.910\nactually draws well and\nyou draw something.\n\n32\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.890\nBack in the day when we did\nthings with pencil and paper, and\n\n33\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.070\nthen kind of maybe scan it in or\nsomething like that.\n\n34\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.214\nI think that was kind of one of\nthe real original benefits to this,\n\n35\n00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:44.980\ncuz you kind of think about Illustrator,\nyou're illustrating.\n\n36\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.090\nNow that's not to say that this isn't\ngonna work on a more complex image.\n\n37\n00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.230\nIt certainly will,\nyou're just gonna get different results.\n\n38\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.260\nSo the example that I'm gonna use is just\na black and white flower, we can make this\n\n39\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.780\navailable in the [LAUGH] files for\nyou to test out as well.\n\n40\n00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.472\nSo what I am gonna do,\nI need to go ahead and place that in.\n\n41\n00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:07.606\nJust gonna do a file placement,\nI'm gonna use command shift P,\n\n42\n00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:09.069\nbecause I'm feeling fancy.\n\n43\n00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.647\nAnd I want to use the keyboard shortcut,\nand\n\n44\n00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:16.980\nthen you see I'm gonna go ahead and grab\nFlower.JPG, so this is an actual image.\n\n45\n00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.220\nYes I made this in illustrator,\ntechnically, but\n\n46\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.490\nthen I exported it out as an image.\n\n47\n00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.710\nDon't need to know that.\n\n48\n00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.550\nBasically, where we're just looking at,\nyes, I have a JPEG file.\n\n49\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.212\n&gt;&gt; So someone's like wow,\nyou draw so precisely.\n\n50\n00:02:28.212 --> 00:02:29.265\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I do.\n\n51\n00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:30.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in Illustrator.\n\n52\n00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.774\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, no, no.\n\n53\n00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:36.830\nThere was some curvature tool action\nin this, a couple other things.\n\n54\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.965\nBut yeah, I just exported it out as\nan image so that we could use it for\n\n55\n00:02:39.965 --> 00:02:40.900\nthis example here.\n\n56\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.090\nNow, you may have noticed some of\nthat information that pops up in your\n\n57\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.140\nControl Panel when you have an image.\n\n58\n00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.849\nSo, I see here, okay,\nyou got that linked file, flower.jpg.\n\n59\n00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.892\nI can see the ppi, embed, [SOUND].\n\n60\n00:02:52.892 --> 00:02:56.359\nBut then I stop right here,\ngo down to image trace.\n\n61\n00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.726\nWhat does that mean?\n\n62\n00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:02.416\nWe are actually going to trace this\nimage to create pads out of it,\n\n63\n00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.820\nwhich is so cool, I think.\n\n64\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.380\nAgain, and especially works out well for\nsomething like a black and white image.\n\n65\n00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.060\nBut, if you wanna get crazy and\ndo color and\n\n66\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.870\nsomething a little bit more complex,\nthat will work too.\n\n67\n00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.840\nJust be aware of how\nthe results might change.\n\n68\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.360\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and just single\nclick on this image trace button.\n\n69\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.350\nAnd then what we see here is, okay,\nyou may not have seen much different\n\n70\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.250\nespecially with an example like\nthis because I made this so\n\n71\n00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.380\nI know this one works.\n\n72\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.340\nBut depending on what your image looks\nlike you might see something that looks\n\n73\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.460\ntotally different.\n\n74\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.910\nIf you zoom in we could probably\nsee when it was an image.\n\n75\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.368\nIf we undo or,\nwell I guess it didn't really change much.\n\n76\n00:03:40.368 --> 00:03:42.687\nBecause we have the result on top.\n\n77\n00:03:42.687 --> 00:03:46.778\nShe'll get into the options but\nsometimes, you might be able to,\n\n78\n00:03:46.778 --> 00:03:51.453\nonce we get into the options on how we do\nthe tracing you'll be able to see like\n\n79\n00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:53.865\nthe result versus like the original and\n\n80\n00:03:53.865 --> 00:03:57.690\nyou can see the pixels versus the path but\nwe'll get there so.\n\n81\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.803\nI should tell myself, hold your\nhorses Vonne, we're gonna get there.\n\n82\n00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:02.806\n&gt;&gt; No, I think it, no no no.\n\n83\n00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:04.020\n[LAUGH] I like it, I like it.\n\n84\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.200\nThere's one minor difference\nactually that I have picked up on.\n\n85\n00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.780\nIf I go ahead here it's\ngonna look mostly the same.\n\n86\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.870\nAgain, I created this\nknowing that it would work.\n\n87\n00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.660\nBut if I click on that image trace\nicon just watch kinda right here.\n\n88\n00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.260\nIf I go ahead and hit image trace\nyou see how it's gonna kinda jut\n\n89\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.130\nthat little part out a little bit?\n\n90\n00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.060\nThis is minor.\n\n91\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.970\nAgain you could get\nsomething much more extreme,\n\n92\n00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.230\nbut you're going to see\nsome slight variations.\n\n93\n00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.172\nIt's just gonna happen.\n\n94\n00:04:27.172 --> 00:04:30.540\nSo, what you can do is you can kind of\nfilter through some of the defaults and\n\n95\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.786\nkind of look at things\na little bit differently and\n\n96\n00:04:32.786 --> 00:04:34.890\nchoose which options gonna work best for\nyou.\n\n97\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.300\nSo you see here over here\nwhere it says pre-sets.\n\n98\n00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.890\nI'm just picking on the default.\n\n99\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.830\nYou can go though and see, okay,\nhigh-fidelity photo, low-fidelity photo.\n\n100\n00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.730\nAnd then you see all these color options.\n\n101\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.280\nThis was obviously a black and\nwhite image,\n\n102\n00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.410\nthe color options aren't gonna do much for\nme.\n\n103\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.150\nBut if I had a color image and I wanted\nto make it look like a cool poster or\n\n104\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.620\nsomething like that, I could do that.\n\n105\n00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.660\nBe aware, depending on how large your\nimage is, if you have a lot of pixels and\n\n106\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.150\na lot of information in there,\n\n107\n00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.560\nit's probably gonna kind of slug\nup your machine a little bit.\n\n108\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.210\nIt's definitely gonna be something\nthat's gonna take a little bit longer.\n\n109\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nif you have photograph like Ollie, right?\n\n110\n00:05:09.648 --> 00:05:10.148\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n111\n00:05:10.148 --> 00:05:13.317\n&gt;&gt; Our picture of Ollie, if we brought\nthat in there and we went ahead and\n\n112\n00:05:13.317 --> 00:05:15.330\ndid this image trace right here.\n\n113\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.060\nIt would probably,\nyou'd see the progress bar.\n\n114\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.030\nIt's gonna tax out your machine\nbecause think about how many,\n\n115\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.820\n16 million colors are in a JPEG file.\n\n116\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.850\nHow many million colors are there\nto begin with and the resolution or\n\n117\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.100\nthe pixel dimensions was 2,300 by 3,200 or\nsomething like that.\n\n118\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.870\nThere was a lot of pixels.\n\n119\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.227\nSo that's a lot of information for\nit to look at and then trace,\n\n120\n00:05:38.227 --> 00:05:45.019\nfind where the boundaries of each color\nlives and create little paths out of it.\n\n121\n00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.926\nNow, at first when you bring it in\nthe I think it just goes black and\n\n122\n00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:49.570\nwhite because that's the default trace.\n\n123\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.470\nAnd what she's talking about right here\nwith the presets, if the three, six, and\n\n124\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.630\nthe 16 colors.\n\n125\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.575\nIt's gonna go find Ollie's picture of\nall those 16 millions and go ahead and\n\n126\n00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:02.023\nkind of get all of the ones together and\nthen say,\n\n127\n00:06:02.023 --> 00:06:04.772\nwell these are the 16 colors\nthat are prominent, and\n\n128\n00:06:04.772 --> 00:06:08.920\nthose are the ones that it's going\nto display and make the path out of.\n\n129\n00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.520\nAnd so that's what that means when\nyou're doing the color images and\n\n130\n00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.700\nthat high fidelity photo.\n\n131\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.050\nWow, man.\n\n132\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.981\nI've actually had my\ncomputer crash on that one.\n\n133\n00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:20.272\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n134\n00:06:20.272 --> 00:06:21.316\n[LAUGH] I'm not surprised.\n\n135\n00:06:21.316 --> 00:06:23.919\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz then it's taking all of the,\n\n136\n00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.175\nyou get the tiniest little path and\nyou're just like, [SOUND].\n\n137\n00:06:27.175 --> 00:06:29.505\nYeah, my computer, yeah,\nit was like mm-hm, nope.\n\n138\n00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:30.552\nToo much, can't do it.\n\n139\n00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:31.520\n&gt;&gt; Not happening.\n\n140\n00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.223\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was even thinking as you're talking,\n\n141\n00:06:33.223 --> 00:06:34.609\nI was like, well,\nwe could throw Ollie in there.\n\n142\n00:06:34.609 --> 00:06:37.009\nAnd then I was like, mm no, that's\ngonna make everything crash and burn.\n\n143\n00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:38.342\nAnd we just don't want that to happen.\n\n144\n00:06:38.342 --> 00:06:39.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n145\n00:06:39.278 --> 00:06:40.230\n&gt;&gt; So as she was talking I was kinda\n\n146\n00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.438\nfiltering some of these presets just so\n\n147\n00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:42.840\nyou could kinda see some\nof the differences.\n\n148\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.040\nNow again, they're gonna be fairly minor.\n\n149\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.030\nI guess, as I say that,\n\n150\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.599\nthis is probably the most extreme\none we've seen with line art.\n\n151\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.930\nJust depending on the type\nof image that I have, okay?\n\n152\n00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.830\nBecause I had a pretty simple image,\n\n153\n00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.030\nI'm not gonna get these\nreal extreme differences.\n\n154\n00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.110\nSo I'm just gonna stick\nwith the default for\n\n155\n00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.220\nwhat I'm doing cuz that's fine with me.\n\n156\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.249\nNow I want to jump over to the view,\nso Vonne was mentioning, okay,\n\n157\n00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:05.268\nI can view something.\n\n158\n00:07:05.268 --> 00:07:09.089\nView a result with outlines, I can view,\nwhich will kind of show us those paths.\n\n159\n00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:10.540\nI can just view the outlines,\n\n160\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.100\nagain, just kind of the path\noutlines that I'm looking at.\n\n161\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.640\nOutlines with source images.\n\n162\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.570\nYou can see,\njust depending on what you have.\n\n163\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.910\nI can kind of go back to that source image\nso I can see some of the differences there\n\n164\n00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.870\nbetween the result and\nthe actual image itself.\n\n165\n00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.220\nSo again, depending on how complex your\nimage is, this could be really helpful.\n\n166\n00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.210\nNow I want to jump kind of back,\n\n167\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.800\nbetween those two here and\ngrab our image trace panel.\n\n168\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.480\nSo if I just click on this little, kinda\nlooks like a bulleted list if you will.\n\n169\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.510\nIt's just gonna pull up\nour image trace panel.\n\n170\n00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.870\nNow, this is basically another way to kind\nof filter through some of those options.\n\n171\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.973\nYou see if I kinda am\nfiltering on the top,\n\n172\n00:07:48.973 --> 00:07:51.810\nit's gonna take us back\nthrough some of those options.\n\n173\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.779\nBut something else that you may want to\npay attention to is this all the way at\n\n174\n00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:56.473\nthe bottom.\n\n175\n00:07:56.473 --> 00:07:59.845\nI'm skipping past a lot\nof information here and\n\n176\n00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.380\ngoing to that Ignore White option.\n\n177\n00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.092\nSo see here, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose this out, because I was using,\n\n178\n00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:09.376\nlet me switch that back to default.\n\n179\n00:08:09.376 --> 00:08:12.511\nBecause I was using a a jpeg image here,\n\n180\n00:08:12.511 --> 00:08:17.264\nor even, I think this would\nprobably still happen on a png.\n\n181\n00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:21.296\nBut there's gonna be a lot of white when\nwe end up on kind of the outside edges\n\n182\n00:08:21.296 --> 00:08:22.070\nof our image.\n\n183\n00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.623\nSo, because Illustrator is\nviewing this as a whole,\n\n184\n00:08:24.623 --> 00:08:28.614\nthey're not necessarily viewing it as the\nonly part she cares about is the flower.\n\n185\n00:08:28.614 --> 00:08:30.277\nThey're viewing the entire image.\n\n186\n00:08:30.277 --> 00:08:33.321\nSo what's gonna happen is\nwhen we break this apart,\n\n187\n00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:37.834\nI'm gonna have portions over here and\nportions over here that I don't need.\n\n188\n00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:43.003\nSo that Ignore White option will help\nkind of get rid of some of that for us.\n\n189\n00:08:43.003 --> 00:08:47.315\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we talked about this at\nthe very beginning when we were going\n\n190\n00:08:47.315 --> 00:08:51.791\nover the design 101, about\nthe differences between a jpeg and a png.\n\n191\n00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:55.717\nOne supports transparency,\none doesn't, and like you said,\n\n192\n00:08:55.717 --> 00:09:01.039\nit's not necessarily just because of the\njpeg file format, it's seeing all of that.\n\n193\n00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:04.617\nAnd it will make that kinda,\nwhat we think as like the outside,\n\n194\n00:09:04.617 --> 00:09:06.042\nit'll make that a path.\n\n195\n00:09:06.042 --> 00:09:09.503\nThat will be a shape that if you\nwanted to keep it, you could.\n\n196\n00:09:09.503 --> 00:09:13.822\nLater, when we get down, we're gonna make\nit different colors and things like that,\n\n197\n00:09:13.822 --> 00:09:16.442\nbut the Ignore White,\nthat was a big box they put on.\n\n198\n00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:19.917\nI'm like, so much easier, because it\nwasn't always there, I don't think it was,\n\n199\n00:09:19.917 --> 00:09:21.854\nmaybe it was, and\nI was just doing it the long way.\n\n200\n00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:24.737\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would go through and\n\n201\n00:09:24.737 --> 00:09:28.435\nI would delete all those white parts and\nit was like, this is a huge waste of time.\n\n202\n00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:31.242\nAnd I think one of my students was like,\nyou know you can just do that, right?\n\n203\n00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:32.461\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, light bulb.\n\n204\n00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:33.887\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n205\n00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:36.679\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And back to the panel,\n\n206\n00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:42.542\nthere's all these pre, we're not gonna\ngo over every single one of those.\n\n207\n00:09:42.542 --> 00:09:45.220\nOne of those is, drag it to the left,\ndrag it to the right,\n\n208\n00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.870\nsee what it changes and\njust kind of get familiar with it.\n\n209\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.496\nAnd I don't know if you\nwere getting there, so\n\n210\n00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:50.757\nI don't wanna steal your thunder.\n\n211\n00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:54.789\nBut on this one, we see where it says,\nCreate, Fills vs Strokes,\n\n212\n00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:57.100\ndown towards the bottom right there.\n\n213\n00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.577\nThat's kinda the big one for me,\nwhen I'm doing traces like this.\n\n214\n00:10:01.577 --> 00:10:06.402\nBecause when we go ahead and say, okay,\nwe're done, and now I wanna color it,\n\n215\n00:10:06.402 --> 00:10:08.288\nthis becomes a compound path.\n\n216\n00:10:08.288 --> 00:10:09.426\nRemember, we talked about that?\n\n217\n00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:14.325\nWhere all of those, what we would\nthink of as lines or strokes,\n\n218\n00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:16.460\nthey're actually fills.\n\n219\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.961\nSo that's a nice one for\nif I put it back to strokes,\n\n220\n00:10:20.961 --> 00:10:24.018\nthen all of the lines are strokes.\n\n221\n00:10:24.018 --> 00:10:28.696\nThere's goods and bads, or reasons why\nyou want it, as well as or strokes.\n\n222\n00:10:28.696 --> 00:10:31.098\nBut I just wanted to point that out,\n\n223\n00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:34.713\ncuz it's kind of one that I\nlike to do a lot either way.\n\n224\n00:10:34.713 --> 00:10:37.038\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm glad you pointed that out,\n\n225\n00:10:37.038 --> 00:10:39.631\nespecially with the particular\nimage that we're working with.\n\n226\n00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:42.298\nI'll probably leave this the same,\n\n227\n00:10:42.298 --> 00:10:46.268\njust cuz I kinda like the way\nit looks in the live trace.\n\n228\n00:10:46.268 --> 00:10:46.941\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n229\n00:10:46.941 --> 00:10:49.869\nthat's only my own personal preference,\nso I'm gonna leave it here and\n\n230\n00:10:49.869 --> 00:10:50.784\ngo ahead and set that.\n\n231\n00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:54.257\nBut I would definitely recommend,\ndefinitely check out that Fills vs Strokes\n\n232\n00:10:54.257 --> 00:10:56.792\noption, so I'm so\nglad that you mentioned that as well.\n\n233\n00:10:56.792 --> 00:10:58.907\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose out this panel.\n\n234\n00:10:58.907 --> 00:11:01.165\nAnd again, we're not gonna go\nthrough all that information,\n\n235\n00:11:01.165 --> 00:11:02.406\nthere's simply not enough time.\n\n236\n00:11:02.406 --> 00:11:04.196\nPlay around with it and see what happens.\n\n237\n00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:08.057\nYou're probably thinking, okay,\nthey told me this was the path and\n\n238\n00:11:08.057 --> 00:11:10.865\nI've now converted this\nto vector information.\n\n239\n00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:13.151\nBut I don't really see anything different,\n\n240\n00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:16.109\nremember that expand that we\ntalked about a couple times?\n\n241\n00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:18.350\nWe need to now expand this out, so\n\n242\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.688\nthat it will kind of break away\nfrom this tracing result option.\n\n243\n00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:25.742\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just click\non this Expand button for this one.\n\n244\n00:11:25.742 --> 00:11:28.512\nIt's right here for us,\nwe don't have to go to our Object menu.\n\n245\n00:11:28.512 --> 00:11:34.812\nAnd you can even see when you hover over\nit, Convert tracing objects into paths.\n\n246\n00:11:34.812 --> 00:11:38.798\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and hit Expand,\nand you see when that happens,\n\n247\n00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:41.846\nyou now can kind of see\nthe path outlines showing up.\n\n248\n00:11:41.846 --> 00:11:46.532\nI no longer have that X in my bounding\nbox, kind of making it look like an image,\n\n249\n00:11:46.532 --> 00:11:47.952\nI can start to see that.\n\n250\n00:11:47.952 --> 00:11:52.611\nI can even kind of double-click, and start\nto actually pull out some of my paths,\n\n251\n00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:55.189\nlike you can see here,\nGroup Compound Path.\n\n252\n00:11:55.189 --> 00:11:56.734\nThat's what I'm working with.\n\n253\n00:11:56.734 --> 00:12:00.272\nNow I believe, as a default,\neverything is always grouped.\n\n254\n00:12:00.272 --> 00:12:03.335\nSo what you could do here,\nI could right-click, and Ungroup,\n\n255\n00:12:03.335 --> 00:12:06.299\nif I wanted to start to isolate\nsome of these pieces right now.\n\n256\n00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:08.467\nNot really gonna matter for\nwhat we're doing, or\n\n257\n00:12:08.467 --> 00:12:10.076\nwhat we're kind of going into next.\n\n258\n00:12:10.076 --> 00:12:13.931\nBut obviously, depending on how you wanna\nwork with this, you may wanna go ahead and\n\n259\n00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:14.539\nungroup it.\n\n260\n00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:16.730\nAnd you may have to\nungroup a couple of times.\n\n261\n00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.186\nThere may be a group within a group,\nwithin a group, within a group.\n\n262\n00:12:20.186 --> 00:12:23.352\nAnd I would say that would be where your\nLayers panel would come in handy as well.\n\n263\n00:12:23.352 --> 00:12:26.721\nSo if I look at the layers involved,\nI notice, okay, I have a group, and\n\n264\n00:12:26.721 --> 00:12:28.396\nI've got something else going on.\n\n265\n00:12:28.396 --> 00:12:31.597\nSo I may need to go through that\na couple of different times, again,\n\n266\n00:12:31.597 --> 00:12:33.238\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n267\n00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:38.567\n&gt;&gt; For example, you might want to only\nhave the flower here and not the stem.\n\n268\n00:12:38.567 --> 00:12:41.934\nSo if you wanted to take away the stem,\nfor whatever reason,\n\n269\n00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:45.446\nyou can go ahead and ungroup it,\nselect those paths, lead it.\n\n270\n00:12:45.446 --> 00:12:48.062\nI do that a lot of times, where it's like,\n\n271\n00:12:48.062 --> 00:12:51.135\nI just want a little bit\napart of the traced image.\n\n272\n00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:54.886\nSo that might be a reason why you'll\nungroup or group, like you said, for\n\n273\n00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:57.443\nour purposes,\nit doesn't necessarily matter.\n\n274\n00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:58.500\n&gt;&gt; No, it does not.\n\n275\n00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.052\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yes, I like that example,\n\n276\n00:13:01.052 --> 00:13:04.632\nI like my stem, I was very proud\nof my stem, so I'm gonna leave it.\n\n277\n00:13:04.632 --> 00:13:07.317\nBut if I wanted to go ahead and\ncut that out, I could.\n\n278\n00:13:07.317 --> 00:13:12.226\nNow, we're gonna get into something\nthat I think is even more fun with this.\n\n279\n00:13:12.226 --> 00:13:14.226\nAnd we are going to jump\ninto our live paint, and\n\n280\n00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:16.328\nwe are actually going to\napply some color on this.\n\n281\n00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:18.197\nNow why do I think this is exciting?\n\n282\n00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:22.226\nBecause live paint is basically\nIllustrator's version of paint-by-numbers.\n\n283\n00:13:22.226 --> 00:13:24.541\nSo what we can do, and\nI stole that term from Vonne, thank you.\n\n284\n00:13:24.541 --> 00:13:27.596\n[LAUGH] I can see her like,\nuh-huh, uh-huh, [LAUGH].\n\n285\n00:13:27.596 --> 00:13:31.694\nSo what we can do here is we can now\nkind of just with our lack paint tool,\n\n286\n00:13:31.694 --> 00:13:33.783\nselect all the individual pieces.\n\n287\n00:13:33.783 --> 00:13:38.456\nAnd apply color swatches to them, which\ndoesn't really sound all that exciting.\n\n288\n00:13:38.456 --> 00:13:42.096\nBut I think the method for doing it,\ncompared to having to go through and\n\n289\n00:13:42.096 --> 00:13:43.990\nselect all these individual paths.\n\n290\n00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.143\nAnd things like that,\nis going to be a lot easier.\n\n291\n00:13:46.143 --> 00:13:49.637\nSo I want to go ahead and\nmake sure that I have this shape selected.\n\n292\n00:13:49.637 --> 00:13:53.649\nBecause the first step in this process is\ngonna be actually converting it to a live\n\n293\n00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:55.480\npaint group, is what it's called.\n\n294\n00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.018\nAnd the way I usually do this\nis just by going ahead and\n\n295\n00:13:58.018 --> 00:13:59.469\ngrabbing my live paint tool.\n\n296\n00:13:59.469 --> 00:14:03.366\nNow my live paint tool is hidden\nunder my shape builder tool.\n\n297\n00:14:03.366 --> 00:14:07.142\nIf you saw us in the shape builder\nepisode, we kept getting confused,\n\n298\n00:14:07.142 --> 00:14:10.352\ncuz we're used to the live paint\nbeing here, so we go here.\n\n299\n00:14:10.352 --> 00:14:11.279\nWe're gonna click and\n\n300\n00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:13.771\nhold on our shape builder tool\nto grab the live paint bucket.\n\n301\n00:14:13.771 --> 00:14:17.269\nYou'll see that there's a live paint\nbucket, and a live paint selection tool.\n\n302\n00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:20.791\nI'm just gonna start with my live paint\nbucket, and you're gonna see here,\n\n303\n00:14:20.791 --> 00:14:23.458\nit's gonna say, okay,\nclick to make a live paint group.\n\n304\n00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:26.299\nWe wanna go ahead and do that so that we\ncan actually use our live paint tools.\n\n305\n00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:29.282\nSo I'm just gonna single click on that,\nand you'll see it's gonna go ahead and\n\n306\n00:14:29.282 --> 00:14:30.002\napply some color.\n\n307\n00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:34.156\nNow, what I wanna do is I wanna go\nahead and jump into my swatches panel.\n\n308\n00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:37.580\nAnd you see if I go ahead,\nI just picked a blue kind of at random,\n\n309\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.178\nyou see I'm gonna have\nthat blue on by default.\n\n310\n00:14:40.178 --> 00:14:42.377\nThen we're gonna have the two\ncolors next to it, right?\n\n311\n00:14:42.377 --> 00:14:45.651\nIt's kind of, just looking at our\nswatches panel, if you look and\n\n312\n00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:47.298\nsee how our swatches panel goes.\n\n313\n00:14:47.298 --> 00:14:50.938\nI have green, then I have blue,\nand then I have a darker blue,\n\n314\n00:14:50.938 --> 00:14:54.593\nI can kind of click through here,\nstart applying some color.\n\n315\n00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:58.181\nCuz every time I see that blue,\nI know, okay, if I single click,\n\n316\n00:14:58.181 --> 00:14:59.632\nI'm applying that blue.\n\n317\n00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:02.995\nBut what I can also do,\nwhich is where some of the fun comes in,\n\n318\n00:15:02.995 --> 00:15:06.711\nI can use my right and left arrow\nkeys to filter through my swatches.\n\n319\n00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:11.705\nSo you see here, as I'm clicking my right\narrow key, watch my swatches panel,\n\n320\n00:15:11.705 --> 00:15:14.399\nand watch how the box\nis going to the right.\n\n321\n00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:19.888\nAnd you can see it moving, and\nyou can see how it's filtering through\n\n322\n00:15:19.888 --> 00:15:25.005\non my actual live paint object as well,\nso super, super handy.\n\n323\n00:15:25.005 --> 00:15:29.964\nAnd you can do this, just paint it to\nhowever you think would look good.\n\n324\n00:15:29.964 --> 00:15:35.902\nSo I can go here, and I can say, okay,\nmaybe I want these to be a certain color.\n\n325\n00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:39.909\nThis is where I always get caught up,\ncuz I'm like what colors am I gonna pick,\n\n326\n00:15:39.909 --> 00:15:41.300\nwhat colors am I gonna pick?\n\n327\n00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.333\nThis is gonna be a very blue flower,\napparently,\n\n328\n00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:47.668\nthis is a Smurf of flowers\nthat I'm going for, [LAUGH].\n\n329\n00:15:47.668 --> 00:15:52.120\n&gt;&gt; And you can see when she's\nhovering over those pieces or paths,\n\n330\n00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.356\nit's making that red outline.\n\n331\n00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:58.308\nThat says, this is the place when\nyou click, it's gonna fill in.\n\n332\n00:15:58.308 --> 00:16:02.883\nIt's kind of, it took all of those things\nand then found where the paths make those,\n\n333\n00:16:02.883 --> 00:16:05.800\nwell, they're already shapes so it's done.\n\n334\n00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.660\nIt's really making them anyways.\n\n335\n00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.060\nBut notice if you hover over in between,\nright there.\n\n336\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.480\nSee, that right there,\nwhy is it highlighting all of that?\n\n337\n00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.796\nBecause that whole compound path of how\nwe went ahead and did the live trace.\n\n338\n00:16:18.796 --> 00:16:23.706\nBut if you wanted to make all that black\noutline into pink or [LAUGH] whatever,\n\n339\n00:16:23.706 --> 00:16:24.790\nyou can do that.\n\n340\n00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:29.070\nSo just watch where those red\noutlines are showing up and\n\n341\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.710\nthat's where you're going\nto be applying the fill.\n\n342\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.817\nAnd yes, I agree, I love Live Paint.\n\n343\n00:16:32.817 --> 00:16:35.867\nIt's so much easier like you said,\ninstead of selecting everything and\n\n344\n00:16:35.867 --> 00:16:37.219\napplying swatches, you just.\n\n345\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.113\nBoop, boop, boop, boop, boop, and\nit's yeah, boop, boop, boop, yeah.\n\n346\n00:16:41.113 --> 00:16:41.852\n&gt;&gt; Boop.\n\n347\n00:16:41.852 --> 00:16:42.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n348\n00:16:42.815 --> 00:16:46.649\nNow and I'm glad you pointed out the red\noutline is definitely really something you\n\n349\n00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:47.810\nwanna pay attention to.\n\n350\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.880\nCuz what's gonna happen is\nyou're gonna go click here, and\n\n351\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.735\nyou're gonna be like no, shoot.\n\n352\n00:16:50.735 --> 00:16:52.325\nI didn't mean to change that.\n\n353\n00:16:52.325 --> 00:16:55.015\nAnd so it's definitely something\nthat you're gonna wanna look at.\n\n354\n00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:58.785\nNow, I am using my right and\nleft arrow keys to filter through.\n\n355\n00:16:58.785 --> 00:17:00.215\nYou don't have to.\n\n356\n00:17:00.215 --> 00:17:03.535\nI could go over to my swatchs panel, like\nsay, okay, I wanna jump to green now for\n\n357\n00:17:03.535 --> 00:17:05.025\nmy stem.\n\n358\n00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.585\nRealize that if you don't\nwant to filter through that,\n\n359\n00:17:07.585 --> 00:17:11.595\nyou could just use your right and\nleft arrow keys, or I'm sorry.\n\n360\n00:17:11.595 --> 00:17:13.215\nYou could just click on\nyour swatches panel.\n\n361\n00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:15.180\nAnd now something else I\nwanna point out with this.\n\n362\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.330\nIs the live paint selection tool.\n\n363\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:21.400\nThe live paint selection tool kind of\ngoes along with the live paint tool.\n\n364\n00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.510\nSay what I have here, this example,\nwhere I have several of my pieces,\n\n365\n00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.740\nlike my petals,\nare going to be using the same color.\n\n366\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.910\nMy live paint selection tool,\nif I go ahead and\n\n367\n00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.430\njust single-click and\nthen Shift-click will allow me to select\n\n368\n00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.840\nmultiple items at one time that\nI can then use for Live Paint.\n\n369\n00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.650\nSo if I say, okay, I know I want these to\nbe orange or something like that, it's\n\n370\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.620\ngoing to make it a little easier to select\nmultiple different items all at once.\n\n371\n00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.620\nJust a little bit of a time saver.\n\n372\n00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.130\nSo now I can go here and be like,\nwell I'm missing some pink in this.\n\n373\n00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.120\nClearly, there's something wrong.\n\n374\n00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.280\nSo I need to go and I say, okay,\nI wanna go ahead and add pink and\n\n375\n00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.070\ndo whatever you need to do.\n\n376\n00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.600\nAnd you can kinda balance it back and\nforth between the Live Paint bucket and\n\n377\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.890\nthe Live Paint selection tool.\n\n378\n00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.420\nSo I'm probably gonna go here, okay?\n\n379\n00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.620\nI don't really like this black.\n\n380\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.200\nMaybe the last step I'll do,\nI'll go ahead and select this and\n\n381\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.470\nmaybe I'm just gonna\nmake that one white and\n\n382\n00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:20.290\nit kinda gives the appearance that\nall that is kinda off on its own.\n\n383\n00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.780\nI don't know,\nI think it's kinda fun looking.\n\n384\n00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.940\nSo definitely one to play around with.\n\n385\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.860\nAnd definitely one to think about this is\nnot necessarily tied specifically to our\n\n386\n00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.400\nimage tray.\n\n387\n00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.260\nSo I did not have to trace an image.\n\n388\n00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.820\nTo use my Live Paint tool.\n\n389\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.500\nIt's something that I can do on anything.\n\n390\n00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.860\nSo if you have a kind of a complex\npiece of art that you've created,\n\n391\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.590\nLive Paint it up.\n\n392\n00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or\neven just maybe a couple squares.\n\n393\n00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:46.710\nGo ahead and draw in four squares and kind\nof overlap them and then select them all.\n\n394\n00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.030\nThe biggest thing, like you say,\n\n395\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.710\nyou just have to make sure you\nmake it a Live Paint group.\n\n396\n00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.450\nSo any path, any shapes,\n\n397\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:58.670\nany type of vector paths together,\nwhatever you want to become that group,\n\n398\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.840\nthat live painting group, select them,\nuse the bucket to convert them.\n\n399\n00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.200\nI think you can do it in the object menu\ntoo, I always just go onto the live paint\n\n400\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.340\nbucket to make it that and that's easy and\nso then it will go ahead and find,\n\n401\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.760\nlike if you have squares overlapping,\nit will find where all the pieces are, and\n\n402\n00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.420\nthen you can go ahead and\nfill it in from there.\n\n403\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.180\nSo yeah, definitely not tied\ntogether to the image trace.\n\n404\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.785\nAnd then one more thing,\nI don't know if you are getting there,\n\n405\n00:19:22.785 --> 00:19:26.260\n[LAUGH] with this live paint group,\nit is special.\n\n406\n00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.660\nAnd the way you know that\nit is a live paint group.\n\n407\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.395\nYou see in the corners, and\nyou could just do a normal zoom.\n\n408\n00:19:31.395 --> 00:19:32.856\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to do the fancy zoom.\n\n409\n00:19:32.856 --> 00:19:33.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The fancy zoom\n\n410\n00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.630\nthat makes me nervous every time?\n\n411\n00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:36.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:36.970\n&gt;&gt; No those little,\n\n413\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:42.420\nthey're almost like little asterisks in\nthe bounding box dots, we'll call them.\n\n414\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.070\nAnd that indicates to you that\nthis is a Live Paint group,\n\n415\n00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.090\nnot just a regular group,\nthe Live Paint group.\n\n416\n00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.070\nSo it's special in that sense of how\nit's going to treat the information.\n\n417\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.890\nAnd one last other thing, see that\nexpand button up there at the top.\n\n418\n00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.290\nThis, if you don't want it to act\nas a Live Paint group anymore and\n\n419\n00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:06.120\nyou just want it to go back to\na regular group or what have you.\n\n420\n00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.220\nYou can go ahead and expand that and\nthen it's just normal paths and\n\n421\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.420\nyou can go on your merry way.\n\n422\n00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.940\nThere's no reason why you have to\ntake it out of a Live Paint group.\n\n423\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.160\nIf you're like, I'm good.\n\n424\n00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.440\nThis is set, my flower's done.\n\n425\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.260\nIt's fine, it's just a last step\nif you wanna do other things.\n\n426\n00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n427\n00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.930\n&gt;&gt; Potentially.\n\n428\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.860\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it could help to go ahead and\ntake that out.\n\n429\n00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.030\nAnd that expand option was\navailable in our control bar,\n\n430\n00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.990\nbut it was also available in our object\nmenu, object, live paint, and then expand.\n\n431\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:36.330\nSo, yeah, definitely something that\nyou may want to look at, and I'm so\n\n432\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.802\nglad Vonne is here\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n433\n00:20:37.802 --> 00:20:39.246\n&gt;&gt; To help with things out.\n\n434\n00:20:39.246 --> 00:20:42.470\n&gt;&gt; It's just those little things that\nthey add because people have said,\n\n435\n00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.110\nwhy do I have these little star\nthings in my bounding box.\n\n436\n00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.502\nAnd I'm like it's a Live Paint group.\n\n437\n00:20:47.502 --> 00:20:49.320\nOf course, I would have known that.\n\n438\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:49.995\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] duh.\n\n439\n00:20:49.995 --> 00:20:52.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it just comes from just years,\n\n440\n00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.040\nand years, and years of doing this stuff.\n\n441\n00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.820\nBut yeah, it's so much fun to be able to\ndo the image trace, and the live paint.\n\n442\n00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.875\nIt's just, like you said, it's one of\nthose fun things that makes us a little\n\n443\n00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:07.943\neasier to be able to paint something by\nnumber, just want to say and grab that.\n\n444\n00:21:07.943 --> 00:21:10.570\nDo we have anything else\nwe want to add with this?\n\n445\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.410\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\nY'all can just enjoy my\n\n446\n00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.010\nflower\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n447\n00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.030\n&gt;&gt; To your heart's content to just\n\n448\n00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.180\ntake in the beauty [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then you can take this and make\n\n449\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:23.930\na pattern swatch, you can go ahead and\nmake a symbol and you can make a brush.\n\n450\n00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.110\nMake this into a scatter [INAUDIBLE].\n\n451\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.060\nAll the things that we've been\ndoing through this entire show it's\n\n452\n00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.980\nlike you can go crazy\nwith all of these things.\n\n453\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.170\nBecause it's just vectors.\n\n454\n00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.980\nSo, you wanna make a brush?\n\n455\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.950\nYou wanna make a pattern?\n\n456\n00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.330\nYou wanna make a symbol?\n\n457\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:41.680\nYou wanna do some other things things\n[LAUGH] you're more than welcome.\n\n458\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.590\nAnd it's an easy way to kinda get\nsomething that isn't in image form\n\n459\n00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.770\ninto vector form so yeah.\n\n460\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.740\nAll right,\nwell I think that's about it for this one.\n\n461\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.520\nGreat introduction.\n\n462\n00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.494\nTo these two awesome concepts or\ncommands or things in Illustrator.\n\n463\n00:21:57.494 --> 00:22:00.850\n[LAUGH] All right,\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n464\n00:22:00.850 -->

Yes, I'm bringing the fun.\n\n10\n00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:32.728\nI'm bringing the perspective\non the perspective grid tool.\n\n11\n00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:34.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just thought about that as you\n\n12\n00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:34.764\nwere talking.\n\n13\n00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:36.086\nI was like, I'm so clever.\n\n14\n00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:36.799\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did there.\n\n15\n00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:37.568\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say that.\n\n16\n00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:42.103\n[LAUGH] Now, so what we're gonna be\ntalking about today is the perspective\n\n17\n00:00:42.103 --> 00:00:45.150\ngrid tool, the perspective grid tool.\n\n18\n00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.669\nI feel like is maybe one of those if\nyou've popped into illustrator and you've\n\n19\n00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:52.310\nkinda played around and you open it up and\nyou're like, whoa what is this thing?\n\n20\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.331\nAnd how do I move it?\n\n21\n00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:54.930\nAnd what do I do with it?\n\n22\n00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.905\nHow to get rid of it?\n\n23\n00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:58.225\nIt's kind of that tool for\na lot of people, I feel like.\n\n24\n00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.235\nOr at least it was for me when I was\njust first kind of opening it up and\n\n25\n00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:02.355\nplaying around with illustrator.\n\n26\n00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:05.055\nBut basically,\nwhat our perspective grid tool does,\n\n27\n00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:07.635\nis it's gonna allow us draw\nthings in perspective.\n\n28\n00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:11.588\nSo essentially, it's kind of allowing\nus to draw things more in a 3D.\n\n29\n00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:15.863\nSo if you kind of think about\nthe rendering of a house or\n\n30\n00:01:15.863 --> 00:01:19.957\nsome sort of architectural\nstructure if you will.\n\n31\n00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:21.709\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am not an architect.\n\n32\n00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.560\nYou can kinda think about how this\nwould be used to that advantage.\n\n33\n00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.520\nYou wanna draw that in that dimension.\n\n34\n00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.473\nSo that's basically what\nwe're gonna be doing today.\n\n35\n00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:30.920\nNow, I'm gonna do it on\na much smaller scale.\n\n36\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.549\nMy house is gonna be a little bit less\nrealistic than maybe an architect,\n\n37\n00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.043\nbut same concept, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like a kindergarten house, right?\n\n38\n00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:40.563\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n39\n00:01:40.563 --> 00:01:43.518\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nwe haven't gotten out of kindergarten.\n\n40\n00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:46.819\nWell, we went to first grade for a little\nbit, but now we're back to kindergarten,\n\n41\n00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.557\nand were gonna make\na very primitive house.\n\n42\n00:01:48.557 --> 00:01:50.830\nHow about that?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, exactly.\n\n43\n00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.662\nSo you can even see I've got\nmy little flowers going over.\n\n44\n00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:54.040\nI got My House ready.\n\n45\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.259\nI even have to title My House.\n\n46\n00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.662\nWhat we're gonna do, okay,\nnaturally is the first thing,\n\n47\n00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:00.880\nwe're gonna grab our\nperspective grid tool.\n\n48\n00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.920\nI have these things kinda\nhanging out over here.\n\n49\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.570\nBut that's just something\nI'm gonna deal with later.\n\n50\n00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.865\nSo I want to go ahead and\ngrab my perspective grid tool.\n\n51\n00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:14.240\nIt's gonna be just above the Gradient\ntool, if that helps you, on the toolbar.\n\n52\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.300\nAnd you pull that up, and you're thinking,\nwhoa, what just happened to my screen?\n\n53\n00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.030\nSo I mentioned that this is gonna be\nsomething that I can draw in perspective.\n\n54\n00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.460\nSo I can kinda work with these planes,\nif you will.\n\n55\n00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.760\nYou can kinda think about it going back.\n\n56\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.236\nIs that geometry, what?\n\n57\n00:02:29.236 --> 00:02:32.703\n&gt;&gt; Did you something like that, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some sort of class you took in high\n\n58\n00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:33.590\nschool, right?\n\n59\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.626\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] In drawing,\n\n60\n00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:39.790\ncuz I was always in band, so\nI didn't take art, that was my elective.\n\n61\n00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.332\nBut you know about the vanishing point,\n\n62\n00:02:42.332 --> 00:02:45.545\nright, of where it goes\nback into the horizon, and\n\n63\n00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:50.370\nthose white dots off to the sides,\nyou can see that's the vanishing point.\n\n64\n00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.241\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And there's a whole bunch of, I'm sure,\n\n65\n00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:55.720\ntechnical terminology that goes along with\nperspective and how it all kind of goes.\n\n66\n00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.650\nWe're just gonna use the blue plane,\n[LAUGH] and the orange plane, and\n\n67\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.590\ngo on like that.\n\n68\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.160\nBut there is a whole theory behind this,\nobviously.\n\n69\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.525\nAnd there's, yeah,\nthere's math involved somewhere, [LAUGH]\n\n70\n00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:08.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, more math always.\n\n71\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.460\nAlways bringing the math.\n\n72\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.350\nSo what I wanted to point out\nwith this is you can actually\n\n73\n00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.560\nkind of change your perspective.\n\n74\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.870\nSo see, you're not necessarily\nstuck with the default.\n\n75\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.740\nThis is not your only option\nthat you have to work with.\n\n76\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.500\nSo you see if I kinda drag really any of\nthese, like white diamonds, white boxes\n\n77\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.140\nyou're gonna use here to really adjust\nthat vanishing point, if you will.\n\n78\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.550\nI can drag this down and\n\n79\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.660\nyou can see how it's gonna adjust\nall of my perspectives there.\n\n80\n00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.490\nSo if I wanna kinda drag in that house,\nyou have several different options for\n\n81\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.260\nmoving this.\n\n82\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.708\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthose little gray dots at the bottom.\n\n83\n00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:41.305\nI always call them swinging the gate open.\n\n84\n00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:45.130\nAnd you can push the gate back and\nchange the vantage point.\n\n85\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.825\nIt's really all about how\nthe perspective you wanna have.\n\n86\n00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:54.986\nI know I tend to stay right here\non the defaults cuz after that,\n\n87\n00:03:54.986 --> 00:03:58.510\nI start to get a little\nconfused only because I don't\n\n88\n00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.730\nknow necessarily the whole\nmechanics of that.\n\n89\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.374\nBut you have all of these modifications\nthat you can make within this grid.\n\n90\n00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:13.380\nAnd there's also that plane of the green,\nwhere it's not in perspective.\n\n91\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.545\nIt's like still in perspective but\nflat, it goes pretty crazy.\n\n92\n00:04:17.545 --> 00:04:19.675\nAnd if you know about this stuff,\nyou're probably like, yeah,\n\n93\n00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:21.230\nyou're doing a horrible\njob of explaining it.\n\n94\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.979\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, yes, [LAUGH] that's funny.\n\n95\n00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.237\nSo what I wanna do here to kinda just\ndemonstrate that point that this is not\n\n96\n00:04:28.237 --> 00:04:30.143\nthe only thing that we're gonna set with.\n\n97\n00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:33.524\nI'm gonna hop into a separate document\nhere, and the reason why I'm hopping into\n\n98\n00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:36.815\na separate document is because sometimes\nthis can get a little bit wonky on you.\n\n99\n00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:40.115\nSo I'm gonna go head back and\nturn that perspective grid on here.\n\n100\n00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.304\nHere we go.\n\n101\n00:04:42.304 --> 00:04:44.250\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nturn that perspective grid on.\n\n102\n00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.244\nNow I wanna go into my view menus.\n\n103\n00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:47.430\nSo if go to view.\n\n104\n00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.710\nAnd then, I go down to perspective grid.\n\n105\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.290\nThis one's almost all\nthe way at the very bottom.\n\n106\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.530\nYou can see okay,\nI've got some things at the top.\n\n107\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.005\nBut look at this one point perspective,\ntwo point perspective,\n\n108\n00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:57.041\nthree point perspective.\n\n109\n00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:01.525\nThese are different perspectives that\nyou can use when working with your\n\n110\n00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:03.190\nperspective grid tools.\n\n111\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.450\nIf I do this, I do the One Point\nPerspective, open up that fly out menu and\n\n112\n00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.174\nyou can see how that's gonna change.\n\n113\n00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:12.580\nSo you're not stuck with\njust the three plane option.\n\n114\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you just wanted one,\nI think of them as like, walls, right?\n\n115\n00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:18.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going down a sidewalk and\n\n116\n00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.400\nthis is the one wall and\nthat's the one plane.\n\n117\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.940\nThis is a three plane perspective, and\nthen you have a two plane perspective.\n\n118\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.365\nAnd all the same things we did with\nthe gates and the vanishing points and\n\n119\n00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:28.519\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n120\n00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:33.120\nYou can still move all of that to get what\ntype of one point perspective you want to\n\n121\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.848\nhave, and so on and so forth.\n\n122\n00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:38.630\nSo but as soon as you put the grid on,\nlike that,\n\n123\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.330\nyou can't have multiple\ngrids on the same documents.\n\n124\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.167\nThat's one of like, here's the grid,\nthis is what I got.\n\n125\n00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:51.480\nAnd that's what's going to kinda stay for\nthis particular point in time.\n\n126\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I think that's\na great point to mention too.\n\n127\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.520\nI can only have one option\nhere that I'm working with.\n\n128\n00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.449\nAnd we also have this little circle that\nyou may have been noticing up in the top.\n\n129\n00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.280\nAnd we'll kinda get to that in a second.\n\n130\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.890\nThe way I'm gonna demonstrate that is if I\ngo here, and I go into my rectangle tool,\n\n131\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.940\nnow note when I go into my rectangle tool,\n\n132\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.850\nit's not taking\nthe perspective right away.\n\n133\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.150\nOften times when I'm working with a tool,\nand\n\n134\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.635\nI switch to another tool,\nthat one disappears.\n\n135\n00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:18.770\nSo perspective grid works a little bit\ndifferently because its kind of acting\n\n136\n00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.820\nlike theirs grid lines, if you can kind of\nthink about it when we're using grids and\n\n137\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.240\nguides and things like that.\n\n138\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.660\nSo when I go ahead and\njump into my rectangle tool by default,\n\n139\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.160\nit is gonna draw it that way.\n\n140\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.190\nNow, what if I want my rectangle\nto go kind of on the flip side,\n\n141\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.390\ngo on that orange?\n\n142\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.450\nThat's where that little circle comes in.\n\n143\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.360\nThis is going to activate the specific\nplanes that you're working on.\n\n144\n00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.980\nSo right now, because you see that blue\nthere, I'm working on that blue plane.\n\n145\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:50.027\nNow, I can just single-click over here and\nI can now activate the orange plane.\n\n146\n00:06:50.027 --> 00:06:55.499\nAnd now, when I go to draw a rectangle,\nit's gonna activate my orange side.\n\n147\n00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:59.150\nAnd you can just shift it\ndepending on what you wanna do.\n\n148\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.980\nYou can also select just the circle part,\nand that's gonna choose no active grid.\n\n149\n00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.650\nSo if you don't wanna have an active grid,\n\n150\n00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.210\nmaybe you wanna do something over here,\nkind of separate it out.\n\n151\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.550\nOr you wanted something that actually\nlooked flat, you could go ahead and\n\n152\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.930\nchoose no active grid.\n\n153\n00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.910\nSo that is an option for you.\n\n154\n00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.830\nNow, what I'm gonna do here, I am not\ngonna draw a rectangle, excuse me.\n\n155\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.060\nI'm gonna jump to my block air tool, and\nI'm just gonna start building My House.\n\n156\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.920\nSo I wanna go ahead and\nstart putting these things in place.\n\n157\n00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.828\nShe's like uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:07:29.828 --> 00:07:30.738\n&gt;&gt; And I may need to\n\n159\n00:07:30.738 --> 00:07:35.580\ndo some adjustments here, like you can\nsee My House is getting a little wonky.\n\n160\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.540\n&gt;&gt; And this is because it's not\nsitting in perspective right now,\n\n161\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.600\nbecause you've gone back to the, yes-\n&gt;&gt; This is my mistake.\n\n162\n00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.662\n&gt;&gt; I know, this is like the biggest thing\nwhen working in the prospective grid, and\n\n163\n00:07:47.662 --> 00:07:51.367\nthis tool is that, you're just naturally\ninclined to go back to the black\n\n164\n00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:53.842\narrow tool because that's where we go,\nright?\n\n165\n00:07:53.842 --> 00:07:55.142\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n166\n00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:59.695\n&gt;&gt; Well, the black arrow tool is gonna\njust go ahead and select the object and\n\n167\n00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:01.762\njust select the object, right?\n\n168\n00:08:01.762 --> 00:08:04.097\nAnd if you move it around,\nyou can see it didn't,\n\n169\n00:08:04.097 --> 00:08:07.680\nit stopped kinda staying in the grid and\nwasn't really moving around.\n\n170\n00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.170\nThat's because you don't\ngrab your black arrow tool.\n\n171\n00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.070\nYou have to grab your perspective\ngrid selection tool thing.\n\n172\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.500\nI can't remember its real name, but that's\nthe one that will keep it in perspective.\n\n173\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.680\n&gt;&gt; Gets me every time.\n\n174\n00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.490\n&gt;&gt; Every time.\n\n175\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.154\n&gt;&gt; Clearly, every time.\n\n176\n00:08:20.154 --> 00:08:20.832\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you see,\n\n177\n00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:23.855\nokay, as I was shifting that,\nI was thinking, okay, you know that,\n\n178\n00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:25.000\nsomething's not right.\n\n179\n00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000\nI'm doing something wrong.\n\n180\n00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.083\n&gt;&gt; And also-\n&gt;&gt; It's because I picked\n\n181\n00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:27.598\nmy black arrow tool.\n\n182\n00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:30.818\n&gt;&gt; And also, sorry to jump in,\nif you start moving it,\n\n183\n00:08:30.818 --> 00:08:34.260\nif you want to say down the grid,\nlike the whole square,\n\n184\n00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.120\nyou see right there, it's not staying\nin the actual perspective of the grid.\n\n185\n00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.280\nIt's like, wait, no,\nit's supposed to kind of like, for\n\n186\n00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.750\nlack of a term like, go backwards-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n187\n00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.570\n&gt;&gt; It's not,\nbecause the black arrow tool is\n\n188\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.130\nnot the one you want to use\nto stay in perspective.\n\n189\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.060\nYes, I do it every single time and\nI have to force myself.\n\n190\n00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.050\nNope, that's not what you gotta do.\n\n191\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.630\nYou've gotta get a different tool.\n\n192\n00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.910\nAnd you will do it too.\n\n193\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.550\nAnd so, that is why we're doing that.\n\n194\n00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.542\nWe were just a teachable moment, right?\n\n195\n00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:03.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was doing it on purpose just to see\n\n196\n00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.590\nif Vonne was paying attention.\n\n197\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.252\nDid she have enough coffee today?\n\n198\n00:09:07.252 --> 00:09:08.213\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n199\n00:09:08.213 --> 00:09:11.260\nyeah, you always wanna make sure that\nyou use that perspective selection tool.\n\n200\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.180\nSo I can go here, I can grab that,\nand then now, I can edit\n\n201\n00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.960\nthe dimensions of my shape, and now\nyou'll see okay, if I kind of drag out.\n\n202\n00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.240\nIts gonna go backwards as Mom put it and\ngonna be able to adjust that way.\n\n203\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.100\nI also need my perspective selection tool\nif I wanna grab something that was not\n\n204\n00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.698\nin perspective, so I have these kind\nof things built out here by default.\n\n205\n00:09:32.698 --> 00:09:37.510\nIf I wanna grab that symbol and\nput it into my perspective,\n\n206\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.970\nthen I need to go ahead and\nuse my perspective grid tool.\n\n207\n00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.280\nI can't grab it with the black arrow tool.\n\n208\n00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.567\nIf I go and grab it with the black\narrow tool, and try and drag it here,\n\n209\n00:09:45.567 --> 00:09:47.290\nit's not gonna be in perspective.\n\n210\n00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:47.930\nNow, the layers are a little off.\n\n211\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.970\nThat's why you're not seeing it.\n\n212\n00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.411\nBut I'm just gonna command or control-z.\n\n213\n00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:57.953\nBefore I do this, I'm gonna do an Arrange,\nBring to front on this guy.\n\n214\n00:09:57.953 --> 00:10:00.743\nArrange, Bring to front on this guy.\n\n215\n00:10:00.743 --> 00:10:03.629\nSo now, when I drive these down\nwith my perspective grid tool,\n\n216\n00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:07.545\nthey're actually gonna go in front of\nthe objects that I had there before.\n\n217\n00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:10.305\nAnd you can even see, okay, whoa,\nI hit my shift key and something came up.\n\n218\n00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:14.056\nJust be careful,\nwhen you hit your keys on a keyboard,\n\n219\n00:10:14.056 --> 00:10:17.410\nthis is why it just gets\na little bit wonky on you.\n\n220\n00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.350\nSo it's definitely something you have\nto be aware of as you're working with.\n\n221\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.520\nSo again, I just had my Shift key selected\nby default, cuz I was kinda thinking about\n\n222\n00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.010\nresizing this shape, and\nholding down my Shift key as I did it.\n\n223\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.110\nBut I didn't have the shape selected,\nhit it, it took away that plane.\n\n224\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.280\n&gt;&gt; It hit something,\nlike it hid the plane, and\n\n225\n00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.390\nI don't think I've seen that before, but\nhey, guess what, we found a new shortcut.\n\n226\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.043\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, guess what we\n\n227\n00:10:40.043 --> 00:10:40.896\ndiscovered something new.\n\n228\n00:10:40.896 --> 00:10:44.039\nSo I can go here, I'll be like okay,\nthese are the flowers in my garden.\n\n229\n00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:47.570\nI can Alt drag,\nit's like I duplicate something else.\n\n230\n00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.817\nI can go ahead and draw maybe some\nwindows on this and I can okay,\n\n231\n00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.751\nthat's gonna be my window.\n\n232\n00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:55.950\nOops I have the wrong plane selected.\n\n233\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.970\nGo ahead, get rid of that one.\n\n234\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.421\nI'll just redraw another one.\n\n235\n00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:03.730\n&gt;&gt; We're hitting all the things that\nyou'll do in the prospected grid.\n\n236\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.770\nOops, wrong plane, oops wrong tool.\n\n237\n00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.135\nYes, we really are doing it.\n\n238\n00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.671\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well it just happened, and\n\n239\n00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:14.918\nit's honestly the perspective tools you\ncan probably see is not something that I\n\n240\n00:11:14.918 --> 00:11:15.740\nuse every day.\n\n241\n00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.770\nNow, I'm using the example of a house.\n\n242\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.060\nFor me, what I do as a graphic designer,\nI'm not an architect,\n\n243\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:27.050\nwould be handy for something like,\nif I am trying to display what a clients\n\n244\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.250\nwork would look like on a billboard,\nor something like that.\n\n245\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.644\nAnd if you kinda think about, okay,\nI need it to kind of have that perspective\n\n246\n00:11:32.644 --> 00:11:34.644\nas if it was actually in\na real life scenario.\n\n247\n00:11:34.644 --> 00:11:37.470\nSo that would be why I\nwould use it personally.\n\n248\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.949\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and right,\nthis is the street view but\n\n249\n00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:43.093\nlook at the logo that's going to\nbe in your window of your shop.\n\n250\n00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:48.456\nAnd how that's going to change\nthe visual presence of your business\n\n251\n00:11:48.456 --> 00:11:53.712\nright here on this building if\nyou are changing what you hard.\n\n252\n00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:55.480\nLook up pretty this is.\n\n253\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.510\nThose are different things that I do\nit too, just a kind of get that visual\n\n254\n00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:04.086\nmarkup of the different works that I'm\ndoing for my clients in respective.\n\n255\n00:12:04.086 --> 00:12:07.634\nSo, what I mean,\nI have seen people use this like,\n\n256\n00:12:07.634 --> 00:12:10.788\namazing because they're more of an artist.\n\n257\n00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:11.644\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n258\n00:12:11.644 --> 00:12:13.793\n&gt;&gt; They're more of that type of designer.\n\n259\n00:12:13.793 --> 00:12:15.910\nThey're not necessarily graphic designers.\n\n260\n00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.818\nThey go craziness.\n\n261\n00:12:16.818 --> 00:12:18.772\nI remember I had a student.\n\n262\n00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:20.200\nI was so impressed.\n\n263\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.090\nI was like, how did you do that?\n\n264\n00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.959\nI knew the concept behind-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n265\n00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:26.401\nThis is amazing.\n\n266\n00:12:26.401 --> 00:12:26.924\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n267\n00:12:26.924 --> 00:12:27.711\n&gt;&gt; It was so good.\n\n268\n00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:30.860\nIt had all these trees, and these streets.\n\n269\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.691\nIt blew my mind away.\n\n270\n00:12:32.691 --> 00:12:34.783\n&gt;&gt; I know, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm easily impressed by trees and\n\n271\n00:12:34.783 --> 00:12:36.670\nstreets, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] When you talk about\n\n272\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.070\nthe perspective grid tool.\n\n273\n00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.660\nCuz it's just It's,\nit can be very complicated.\n\n274\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.300\nAgain, as you're seeing here.\n\n275\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.985\nSo I'm messing it up right along with you,\nI promise.\n\n276\n00:12:44.985 --> 00:12:46.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I wanna go ahead and draw my roof.\n\n277\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.880\nSo I just went ahead and\nstarted with the rectangle tool.\n\n278\n00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.520\nNow, I'm gonna grab my\ndelete anchor point tool.\n\n279\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.370\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and just click\nhere, and go ahead and delete that.\n\n280\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.250\nAnd then, I get that kind of\nroof line that I'm going for.\n\n281\n00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.580\nAgain, not an architect.\n\n282\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.606\nRoof line is what I'm gonna say,\n[LAUGH] and\n\n283\n00:13:01.606 --> 00:13:03.700\nthen I'm gonna do\nthe same thing over here.\n\n284\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.956\nI'm gonna draw, oops,\n[CROSSTALK] forgot my plane.\n\n285\n00:13:06.956 --> 00:13:08.003\n&gt;&gt; Which plane are we gonna be on?\n\n286\n00:13:08.003 --> 00:13:10.226\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It gets me every time, every time.\n\n287\n00:13:10.226 --> 00:13:12.493\n&gt;&gt; Actually, aren't there, their hotkeys.\n\n288\n00:13:12.493 --> 00:13:13.692\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; To switch between the plane, right?\n\n289\n00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:17.844\n&gt;&gt; One, two, three, and four will be your\nhotkeys for switching between the planes,\n\n290\n00:13:17.844 --> 00:13:18.730\nyes, thank you.\n\n291\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:23.290\nSo one's gonna be that blue two, you\ncan see, switches to that bottom plane.\n\n292\n00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.570\nThree, four, and\nthen four is that no active grid.\n\n293\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.460\nSo yes,\nI'm definitely glad you brought that up.\n\n294\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's funny cuz as\nsoon as you start doing it,\n\n295\n00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.000\nI'm like wait, I know there is\nsomething that I would always\n\n296\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.670\nkind of hit to make my\nplane shift as I'm going.\n\n297\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.060\nAnd then, wasn't there one,\nI don't want to go too crazy on this,\n\n298\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.720\nlike if I was on one plane and\nI wanted to flip it to the other.\n\n299\n00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.890\nIf I started dragging and while I was\ndragging, if I clicked one of the numbers,\n\n300\n00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.920\nit would turn to that plane?\n\n301\n00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.116\nI think that's how it goes.\n\n302\n00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:50.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYou're like\n\n303\n00:13:50.841 --> 00:13:52.249\n&gt;&gt; Got me there, girl.\n\n304\n00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:53.445\n&gt;&gt; I'm throwing you off.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:13:53.445 --> 00:13:54.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n306\n00:13:54.582 --> 00:13:55.960\n&gt;&gt; This is why they were like, okay,\n\n307\n00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.246\nwe're talking about the things\nwe're gonna discuss and\n\n308\n00:13:58.246 --> 00:14:00.447\nwe got to the perspective grid tool,\nand I was like.\n\n309\n00:14:00.447 --> 00:14:04.893\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yes, tell me,\n\n310\n00:14:04.893 --> 00:14:06.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's just try it.\n\n311\n00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.373\nSo take one of the windows and\nyou are left inside.\n\n312\n00:14:09.373 --> 00:14:14.260\nOkay, start driving it to the right house.\n\n313\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.820\nClick number two while you're driving it,\nhold it down with your mouse.\n\n314\n00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.145\nYour drive gonna hit a three or four.\n\n315\n00:14:21.145 --> 00:14:24.400\nOkay, what I am trying out\nsomething completely, but\n\n316\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.310\nthere is something you can flip in\nthe middle while you're dragging.\n\n317\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.066\n&gt;&gt; Would it be in our view menu?\n\n318\n00:14:29.066 --> 00:14:34.570\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember, I am taking down\nthe wrong path right now, [LAUGH] so\n\n319\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:40.253\ndon't worry about that, proceed, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You see, well, it's okay.\n\n320\n00:14:40.253 --> 00:14:43.309\nI'm sitting over here looking at My House\nlike it looks very Halloween-y, [LAUGH]\n\n321\n00:14:43.309 --> 00:14:44.916\n&gt;&gt; It does, doesn't it?\n\n322\n00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:48.038\n&gt;&gt; But you can go ahead and\ngive your rooms a different color,\n\n323\n00:14:48.038 --> 00:14:49.512\ndo whatever you need to do.\n\n324\n00:14:49.512 --> 00:14:53.600\nJust continue drawing\nyour house if you will.\n\n325\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.690\nAnd you'll see it's just kinda of\na balance between figuring out, okay,\n\n326\n00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.290\nwhat can I do with my\nperspective grid tool?\n\n327\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:03.700\nWhat do I need to use my\nactual regular tools for?\n\n328\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.210\nLike you'll see I jumped to my black\narrow tool just to shift the colors.\n\n329\n00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.135\nCould have done that with my prospective\ngrid selection tool as well.\n\n330\n00:15:10.135 --> 00:15:14.660\nAnd its really just a matter of getting\ncomfortable with it, and again as we said,\n\n331\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.119\ndepending on what you're doing, the type\nof work that you're doing, you may or\n\n332\n00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:20.383\nmay not be using this.\n\n333\n00:15:20.383 --> 00:15:23.238\nThis isn't something that\nI really touch every day,\n\n334\n00:15:23.238 --> 00:15:25.530\nbecause it's just not a nature of my work.\n\n335\n00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.720\nI tend to do a lot of kind\nof flat design style.\n\n336\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.470\nSo, that the way that I work with.\n\n337\n00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.580\nNow, a lot of times what people\nask is how do I get rid of this?\n\n338\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.015\nSo say, I'm done with My House.\n\n339\n00:15:36.015 --> 00:15:37.820\nI didn't use this square over here.\n\n340\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.670\nCool I can go ahead and delete that.\n\n341\n00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.330\nSay, I'm done with it.\n\n342\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.720\nOkay, you have two options.\n\n343\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.494\nOne, I can go ahead and click on this\nx in my circle over here that's gonna\n\n344\n00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:49.013\nselect which planes I'm working on.\n\n345\n00:15:49.013 --> 00:15:51.050\nI'm go ahead and hit that x.\n\n346\n00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.750\nAnd that will get rid\nof my perspective grid.\n\n347\n00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:57.320\nNow, a lot of times for whatever reason, I\nneed to turn that back on after command z,\n\n348\n00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.540\na lot of times for whatever reason\npeople find this difficult to select.\n\n349\n00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.580\nSometimes it's just hard to\nget that x right on the mark.\n\n350\n00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.460\nBecause it can be a little bit small.\n\n351\n00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.350\nJust note that you can\nalso go to your view menu,\n\n352\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.530\ncuz that's definitely happened to me.\n\n353\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.240\nI can go to my view menu, and\nthen I can go down to perspective grid and\n\n354\n00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.680\nI can choose hide grid.\n\n355\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.560\nBecause again, we're accustomed\nto working in Illustrator when,\n\n356\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.520\nokay, I jump between one tool\nto another things go away.\n\n357\n00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.120\nSo when people first pull up\nthe perspective grid tool and\n\n358\n00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.190\nnothing disappears, you're going, wait\na second, how do I get rid of this thing?\n\n359\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.430\nHow do I get rid of this thing?\n\n360\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.240\nThose are the two options that you have.\n\n361\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.120\nSo I have that hide grid\nby selecting the x and\n\n362\n00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.170\nthen go to View menu, Perspective Grid,\nand Hide Grid as well.\n\n363\n00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:46.920\nSo definitely, something that you probably\nwanna be aware of as you're working in it.\n\n364\n00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.460\nAnd note here, okay, now I need to go\nback and jump back to my black air tool.\n\n365\n00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.490\nI had my perspective grid\nselection tool chosen,\n\n366\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.430\nI'm trying to select that,\nit's not working.\n\n367\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.800\nMake sure you go ahead and\njump back into your black arrow tool.\n\n368\n00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.857\nAnd you can see here, okay,\nI'm having a hard time selecting that.\n\n369\n00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.710\nUntil you get rid of it.\n\n370\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.087\nSo it's a tricky one,\nthe perspective grid tool.\n\n371\n00:17:06.087 --> 00:17:09.951\nBut I think it's actually, I joke around\nbut I do think that it's really fun, and\n\n372\n00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:12.040\nit can be relevant and\nuseful to your work.\n\n373\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.843\nAgain, especially if you do need to do a\nlittle bit more 3D modeling I can think it\n\n374\n00:17:16.843 --> 00:17:18.339\ncan be a useful one, so.\n\n375\n00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.645\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI think that's a beautiful house, [LAUGH]\n\n376\n00:17:20.645 --> 00:17:21.349\n&gt;&gt; I thought so.\n\n377\n00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:25.379\n&gt;&gt; And especially if you add strokes to\nsome of these things it might start adding\n\n378\n00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:27.000\na little more dimension to it.\n\n379\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.080\nMaybe on the,\nwhat are those things called?\n\n380\n00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.890\nThe walls, that might give you some more,\nI did look this up,\n\n381\n00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.860\nthe whole moving and\nswitching the planes, it does work.\n\n382\n00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.830\nIt always is supposed to.\n\n383\n00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.013\nIt says, during the drag,\nloop while moving objects,\n\n384\n00:17:43.013 --> 00:17:47.768\nchange the plane using the respective's\nkeyboard change as the object's plane.\n\n385\n00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:52.920\nSo it's one of those things,\nit will flip over if you kind of drag,\n\n386\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.060\nand then hit, I think three well there.\n\n387\n00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.142\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I did before.\n\n388\n00:17:58.142 --> 00:17:58.774\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n389\n00:17:58.774 --> 00:18:00.109\n&gt;&gt; I did not know if it works but-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n390\n00:18:00.109 --> 00:18:01.650\n&gt;&gt; Let see how that's going.\n\n391\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.572\n&gt;&gt; So I'm like, I'm pretty sure,\nI wanna double-check myself and they go,\n\n392\n00:18:05.572 --> 00:18:07.738\nwe might have just kicked it out of there.\n\n393\n00:18:07.738 --> 00:18:08.990\nNo you can't switch over.\n\n394\n00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.323\nAnd I use that with the Alt drag a lot of\ntimes cuz I wanna make another window of\n\n395\n00:18:13.323 --> 00:18:14.220\nthe same size.\n\n396\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.426\nThen flip it over to the other wall,\nAlt drag, hit the two, or three, or\n\n397\n00:18:17.426 --> 00:18:18.225\nfour-\n&gt;&gt; Three.\n\n398\n00:18:18.225 --> 00:18:19.067\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:18:19.067 --> 00:18:19.679\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:20.467\n&gt;&gt; That one I got down.\n\n401\n00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:21.908\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:18:21.908 --> 00:18:22.873\n&gt;&gt; And then, you let go and\n\n403\n00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:24.990\nthen it will go ahead and\nmake that duplicate.\n\n404\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.176\nIt's one of those just like fun little\ntricks that I always though was,\n\n405\n00:18:28.176 --> 00:18:31.694\nthose ones that like just kind of get\nyour fancy like that's really good.\n\n406\n00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:32.832\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I really like that\n\n407\n00:18:32.832 --> 00:18:34.107\nI wanna show people that.\n\n408\n00:18:34.107 --> 00:18:37.155\nSo that's just one of those things\nthat I wanted to throw out.\n\n409\n00:18:37.155 --> 00:18:41.605\nSo yep, it worked, it does work, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You still got it, you still got it,\n\n410\n00:18:41.605 --> 00:18:44.479\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know that's the jury is\n\n411\n00:18:44.479 --> 00:18:47.074\nstill out on that one, but, [LAUGH].\n\n412\n00:18:47.074 --> 00:18:49.959\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Let's jump down into a file,\n\n52\n00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:28.301\nand I'm gonna Vanna for\nyou for now until, yeah,\n\n53\n00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:30.730\nwe get to some other fun stuff at the end.\n\n54\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.318\nSo Vonne's gonna kind of walk us through\nthis first part just because she does love\n\n55\n00:02:34.318 --> 00:02:35.465\nherself some file types.\n\n56\n00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:40.570\nAnd I cannot deny her the opportunity,\nor the joy, to talk about file types.\n\n57\n00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.490\nSo I'm like you go, have your fun.\n\n58\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.810\nSo yeah, what we're going to do is we're\ngonna show the example of a flower shop\n\n59\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.665\nlogo that we've created.\n\n60\n00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:50.228\nIf you can kind of think back\nto the live paint episode,\n\n61\n00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:54.035\nif you're were watching that you'd say,\nhey, this guy's coming back again.\n\n62\n00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:57.865\nAnd now we're acting as if\nthis is the final logo.\n\n63\n00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:02.190\nAnd just like Vonne said, you always give\npeople as many options as they possibly\n\n64\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.790\ncan when it comes to file types.\n\n65\n00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n66\n00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.270\nAnd also, when I'm designing, and\nwe have two art boards here, right.\n\n67\n00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.840\nBecause maybe I have one, I think we have\nthat one as a letter size, we just said,\n\n68\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.170\nokay, let's just make\nit on a piece of paper.\n\n69\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.700\nThe other one is a half,\nit's not necessarily a half paper,\n\n70\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.520\nwe just drew it really quickly.\n\n71\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.090\nBut just to let you know, when I'm doing\nsomething like, back before this ITProTV,\n\n72\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.600\nI know we're in Creative.ProTV, but I\nmade the first iteration logo of ITProTV.\n\n73\n00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.837\nAnd the old one,\nthis one actually is a lot better.\n\n74\n00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:32.337\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.243\n&gt;&gt; But mine was pretty cool too.\n\n76\n00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:36.828\nI literally had 15 different\n\n77\n00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:39.567\nart boards.\nBecause we had ones that needed to go\n\n78\n00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:42.084\nto the Roku channel and\nwe needed ones that went up on our\n\n79\n00:03:42.084 --> 00:03:42.850\nwebsite.\nAnd\n\n80\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.435\nones that were for print.\nAnd\n\n81\n00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:48.155\nI had all my art boards in the dimensions\nthat I needed them to have,\n\n82\n00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:52.970\nand so that huge benefit to\nme is using my art boards.\n\n83\n00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.350\nAnd naming them properly.\n\n84\n00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.670\nAnd then,\nwe have the art board panel, right.\n\n85\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.870\nLet's just throw that up there real quick,\nif you don't mind.\n\n86\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n87\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.350\nLet me go, and just to reiterate,\n\n88\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.660\nthis is exactly something, situations\nwhere I would do the exact same thing.\n\n89\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.344\nIf you're working on\nsomething like a logo,\n\n90\n00:04:07.344 --> 00:04:10.092\nI always have clients with different\ndivision colors that they need, and\n\n91\n00:04:10.092 --> 00:04:11.978\nit's like I just have 20\nart boards in one file.\n\n92\n00:04:11.978 --> 00:04:12.714\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:12.714 --> 00:04:13.466\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n\n94\n00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:14.280\n&gt;&gt; And then knowing the numbers of them.\n\n95\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.360\nYou can see I have art board one is a\nletter, art board two is the half, and so\n\n96\n00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.072\non and so forth.\n\n97\n00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:22.580\nAnd then I do name them properly because\na lot of times when you're doing exports,\n\n98\n00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.210\nit actually keeps the name for you.\n\n99\n00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.920\nPretty good.\n\n100\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.868\nI have the and the RGB and all these\ndifferent dimensions, blah blah blah.\n\n101\n00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:35.582\nBut understanding the numbers does make a\ndifference when we get into the saving and\n\n102\n00:04:35.582 --> 00:04:37.060\nexporting options.\n\n103\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.180\nSo keep that in mind, of knowing what\nartwork is which in your document.\n\n104\n00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.320\nSo lets say that, like I said,\nthe boss wants a JPEG.\n\n105\n00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.310\nThe marketing person wants a TIF file,\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n106\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.880\nRemembering back to transparency\nversus not transparency.\n\n107\n00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.320\nI'm gonna go the old school way,\nbecause I'm\n\n108\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.840\ndying to find out what Emily's gonna tell\nus in this second half of this episode.\n\n109\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.860\nBecause she said it's this whole new\nthing that I know nothing about.\n\n110\n00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.470\nSo let's go to File, and\nwe're gonna go to Export.\n\n111\n00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.300\nBecause remember we're\nin a vector file format,\n\n112\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.510\nwe need to get this out\nin a raster file format.\n\n113\n00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.760\nThe only way we can do that is go\ninto Export, we can't do Save As.\n\n114\n00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.970\nSo we'll go to Export, Export As, cua\nthere's some other new things in there.\n\n115\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.610\nWe'll do that, and then we get into,\njust okay here's my files directory.\n\n116\n00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.550\nWhere do I want to put it?\n\n117\n00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.090\nWhere do I want to go.\n\n118\n00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.630\nDown at the bottom I have my file formats.\n\n119\n00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.840\nThis is where I can choose.\n\n120\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.158\nDo I want a PNG, do I want a JPEG,\ndo I want a TIFF?\n\n121\n00:05:33.158 --> 00:05:37.080\nThere's a whole bunch of other things in\nthere that, I don't really use a lot.\n\n122\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.960\n[LAUGH] So let's go with,\nlet's go with JPEG.\n\n123\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.205\nOkay, we're going to give them\nthe logo with the white background.\n\n124\n00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:47.120\nNow one thing that you do need to be\ncareful about here is you see that little\n\n125\n00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.566\ncheck box down at the bottom where\nit says use artboards, okay.\n\n126\n00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:55.122\nThat's pretty big in a couple\nof different scenarios.\n\n127\n00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:56.538\n&gt;&gt; I'm just so critical.\n\n128\n00:05:56.538 --> 00:06:01.072\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely because if I choose\nthat check box, let's go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:02.940\ncheck it on, use art boards.\n\n130\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.900\nI'm telling it to use the art boards and\nthen look at the two little radio\n\n131\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.630\nbuttons that are right next to it,\nall versus range.\n\n132\n00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.990\nIf I wasn't paying attention to it,\nI'd be exporting all of them.\n\n133\n00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.458\nAnd if I had 15 art boards, guess what,\nall of them are gonna be exported at my\n\n134\n00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:22.260\nJPEG and\nusing the art board dimensions, okay.\n\n135\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.823\nIf I only wanted to give them the white\nbackground one on the big piece of paper,\n\n136\n00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:30.279\nI'll go ahead and choose this,\nand type in the range of 1,\n\n137\n00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.520\nbecause that is the art board number.\n\n138\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.760\nRemember I said,\nremember your art board numbers?\n\n139\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.800\nThat's where it comes into play.\n\n140\n00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.350\nIf I wanted to give them one with\na black background, I'd put it in two.\n\n141\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.520\nAnd that way I'd only give that one\nspecific art board to be exported.\n\n142\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.490\nThe other thing to watch for, say that\nI don't have any art boards, right,\n\n143\n00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.120\nI only have one single art board.\n\n144\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.901\nShe's thinking,\nthat check box doesn't matter.\n\n145\n00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:53.053\nIt does, [LAUGH] it does a lot.\n\n146\n00:06:53.053 --> 00:06:55.208\nBecause remember that flower,\n\n147\n00:06:55.208 --> 00:07:00.084\nwe had it kind of sitting on a big piece\nof white paper, if you want to say.\n\n148\n00:07:00.084 --> 00:07:02.856\nIf you do not check that box off,\n\n149\n00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:07.870\nnone of the white on the art\nboard is going to be exported.\n\n150\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.760\nIt's basically going to find where\nthe pixels stop and make it to that exact\n\n151\n00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.540\ndimensions of wherever the flower and\nflower shop text is at the bottom.\n\n152\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.008\nAnd that's going to be\nthe size of your JPEG or\n\n153\n00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:23.260\nthe raster information\nthat lives in there.\n\n154\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.860\nAnd then you threw out another one\nthat I thought was interesting that\n\n155\n00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.280\nI totally forgot about.\n\n156\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.434\n&gt;&gt; it gets me every time.\n\n157\n00:07:28.434 --> 00:07:32.000\nSo if I'm found working,\nI'm just gonna hit Cancel just right here.\n\n158\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.330\nI am a fan of the paste board,\nlet me tell you.\n\n159\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.510\nSo a lot of times we'll have, maybe like\nI'll have an alternative version just\n\n160\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.860\nkinda sitting off to the side.\n\n161\n00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.785\nThat was like my old way, pretend I\nhave different colors or something, or\n\n162\n00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:46.670\njust something else I was\nplaying with off to the side.\n\n163\n00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.842\nIf you do that export and\nyou don't choose use art boards,\n\n164\n00:07:49.842 --> 00:07:51.990\ngonna pick up all this stuff over here.\n\n165\n00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.004\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna look really weird,\n\n166\n00:07:54.004 --> 00:07:54.850\nlet me tell you.\n\n167\n00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.319\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it's finding all\nthe information that it sees and\n\n168\n00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.982\nmaking the dimension of\nyour file from there.\n\n169\n00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:06.158\nSo that's a big one, There to make\nsure you understand the checkbox,\n\n170\n00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:09.244\nand the importance of why you wanna do it.\n\n171\n00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:13.774\nOne other kind of, my tip,\nI usually will make an artboard\n\n172\n00:08:13.774 --> 00:08:17.942\nto where I give enough of a padding,\nif you wanna say.\n\n173\n00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:20.354\nLike the internal margin\nof where the art sits,\n\n174\n00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:23.731\nit's because I used that, and\nI always check on, use artboards,\n\n175\n00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:27.120\nbecause that's going to be my\nfinal dimension of the file.\n\n176\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.820\nThat's where a lot of times, hey,\nI need a logo that's 600x600 pixels wide.\n\n177\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.963\nI'll just use the artboard tool to make\nan artboard, type in my dimensions,\n\n178\n00:08:35.963 --> 00:08:39.103\nmove the stuff into it,\nby the number, check the box off.\n\n179\n00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:43.960\nI know I've got an exact 600x600 or\n5 inches x 5 inches artboard to know\n\n180\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.260\nthat that's going to be\nthe dimension of the files was huge.\n\n181\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.077\nReally, again,\nthis is the boring stuff but it's so\n\n182\n00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:54.089\nimportant to make sure you\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n183\n00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:56.656\nNow let's just go ahead and\nsay, yeah, that sounds good\n\n184\n00:08:56.656 --> 00:09:00.150\neven if we have all checked off,\ncuz we're gonna cancel this anyways.\n\n185\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.520\nThe next part when you hit OK from here,\n\n186\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.640\nit's this dialogue box that\nmakes a big difference as well.\n\n187\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.280\nThis dialogue box is going to come up for\nif you choose a TIFF,\n\n188\n00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.400\nif you choose a PNG, if you choose\nany of these in the export options.\n\n189\n00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.930\nIt's gonna come into, okay,\n\n190\n00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:22.230\nwell with this particular file format,\nthese are the JPEG options.\n\n191\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.590\nYou get this a lot in Photoshop.\n\n192\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.423\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's my resolution?\n\n214\n00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:23.309\nIf I'm setting it for a web, then I would\nchoose the small, the 72, or the high,\n\n215\n00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:26.786\nthis goes back to the whole like\niPhone stuff and sending pictures,\n\n216\n00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:29.580\ndo you want it to be small,\nmedium, or large?\n\n217\n00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.950\nSame idea here.\n\n218\n00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.937\nSo you know 72 web, 300 print,\nyou check those off.\n\n219\n00:10:35.937 --> 00:10:37.673\nYou would normally click OK, and\n\n220\n00:10:37.673 --> 00:10:42.160\nthen you’d have your files wherever you\nhad designated it in your file directory.\n\n221\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.580\nWe’re gonna click Cancel right here,\njust because that’s what we got.\n\n222\n00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.600\nAnd that’s what your gonna do.\n\n223\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.040\nLike I said TIFF will have TIFF options,\nPNG will have PNG options, and so on and\n\n224\n00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.230\nso forth.\n\n225\n00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.161\nOne other thing, if we're talking\nabout print and having files.\n\n226\n00:10:55.161 --> 00:10:58.556\nSomebody says, hey,\nI need an EPS version of our logo\n\n227\n00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:02.510\ncuz we need to send it to\nthe t-shirt shop and make t-shirts.\n\n228\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.880\nThat's not an export,\n\n229\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:09.150\nthat is a Save As, because vector\nto vector, we're going up to there.\n\n230\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.740\nAnd you can see when you do File\n&gt; Save As, we have the same\n\n231\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.600\noptions down at the bottom, but\nthey're all in the vector formats.\n\n232\n00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.250\nI think we kinda touched on this-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n233\n00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.576\n&gt;&gt; In the File &gt; New,\nwhen we did the file options.\n\n234\n00:11:18.576 --> 00:11:23.130\nBut same thing like if we do EPS,\nor PDF, if I click that and\n\n235\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.590\nsay, I wanna an EPS there, you can see\nyou still have the same artboards,\n\n236\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.070\nthe range, the which ones,\nthe all so be careful of that.\n\n237\n00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:36.220\nSometimes with PDFs, if you're making\nyour artboards like pages or different\n\n238\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:41.250\nversions, it's the same idea here, you've\ngotta make sure you choose the range.\n\n239\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.900\nAnd then PDF has your PDF options,\nwhether you do your high quality print.\n\n240\n00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.690\nChecking off your bleeds,\noptions if you need to go ahead and\n\n241\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.850\nhave a file set up with bleeds,\nyou always need to, where it's over?\n\n242\n00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.050\nMarks and bleeds, right?\n\n243\n00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, marks and bleeds,\nit gets me every time because it's\n\n244\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.410\ndifferent in InDesign\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n245\n00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.080\n&gt;&gt; Gets me every time\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so and again,\n\n246\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.320\nif you have a file set up, with crop marks\nthat you needed that 8 of an inch bleed\n\n247\n00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.760\ndefinitely in your PDF options, make sure\nyou go to that side, the one on the left.\n\n248\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.790\nCheck off the use document bleed settings.\n\n249\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.008\nJust to make sure it's on there,\nyou can see with the Illustrator default,\n\n250\n00:12:16.008 --> 00:12:17.106\nI think it's on there.\n\n251\n00:12:17.106 --> 00:12:19.430\nNo, ALT printer marks,\nthat's what we need to check off, right?\n\n252\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n253\n00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.760\n&gt;&gt; If you need those.\n\n254\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you need the\nprinter marks, you need to go ahead and\n\n255\n00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.090\nadd them on there.\n\n256\n00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.491\nUse document bleed settings is\non by default in Illustrator.\n\n257\n00:12:28.491 --> 00:12:31.033\nIt is InDesign that it is not, I believe,\n\n258\n00:12:31.033 --> 00:12:34.200\nand the difference between\nthe two throws me off.\n\n259\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.270\n&gt;&gt; And that's why I'm just\ninstinctively telling you to go here.\n\n260\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n261\n00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.610\n&gt;&gt; Because of all the stuff I've\ndone in end design as well.\n\n262\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.690\nAnd again,\nif you need to have the printer mark,\n\n263\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.694\nI usually say,\njust check off all printer marks.\n\n264\n00:12:44.694 --> 00:12:45.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n265\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.123\n&gt;&gt; We can go into all sorts of crazy\ndetails of like why you wanna take off\n\n266\n00:12:48.123 --> 00:12:50.107\none thing versus the other,\n[SOUND] no, okay.\n\n267\n00:12:50.107 --> 00:12:55.300\nJust note,\nyou need to send a Print-Ready file, PDF.\n\n268\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.300\nIllustrator options is fine, but\njust check off the mark simply is,\n\n269\n00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.410\nyou save the PDF, and\nthen you're on your way, and that's it.\n\n270\n00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.406\n&gt;&gt; Better to have too many\nmarks than not enough.\n\n271\n00:13:03.406 --> 00:13:03.974\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n272\n00:13:03.974 --> 00:13:05.694\n&gt;&gt; Cuz then you can always take off and\n\n273\n00:13:05.694 --> 00:13:09.084\nmake edit from there, like in\nthe PDF three flights of everything.\n\n274\n00:13:09.084 --> 00:13:10.237\nYou're like, what are you talking about?\n\n275\n00:13:10.237 --> 00:13:11.920\nDon't worry, they can do stuff.\n\n276\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n277\n00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think I'm done\ntalking about all my fun stuff,\n\n278\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.190\nof like the old school way.\n\n279\n00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.595\nBut I know you have some specific things\nthat we need to look for when we're\n\n280\n00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:27.096\ntalking about doing files for web with\nthe pixel grids and pixel previews.\n\n281\n00:13:27.096 --> 00:13:30.946\nYou're gonna cover that in just a second,\nand\n\n282\n00:13:30.946 --> 00:13:35.696\nthis asset export thing,\nI'm so excited, [LAUGH] okay.\n\n283\n00:13:35.696 --> 00:13:36.750\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna lie.\n\n284\n00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.010\nOkay, so,\nthis is one of those things where,\n\n285\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.890\nif you've been working in Illustrator for\na while, you're probably use to that\n\n286\n00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.530\nfile export, or file save for\nweb, or something like that.\n\n287\n00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.060\nBut there are kinda some other\nnew exciting things going on.\n\n288\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.720\nSo I'm gonna jump into a different file.\n\n289\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.770\nYou see I have my flower shop example\nhere cuz I wanna show you how that works.\n\n290\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.835\nNow, one thing that I wanna point out real\nquick, and I'm just gonna close out my\n\n291\n00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:59.280\nartboard panel,\nis just talking about our pixel grid.\n\n292\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.330\nSo, if I'm doing something web-specific,\nyou wanna make sure that you,\n\n293\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.380\nobviously, have it aligned as closely\nas you can to the pixel grid.\n\n294\n00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.180\nCuz that's gonna help keep\nthings from appearing fuzzy.\n\n295\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.820\nIt's just gonna get you exported\nout crisper, cleaner graphic.\n\n296\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.348\nSo what I wanna do,\nI need to zoom in past 600%.\n\n297\n00:14:20.348 --> 00:14:22.135\nSo you see here, and I'm not even,\n\n298\n00:14:22.135 --> 00:14:25.662\nI should have used my alternative\nzooming method, but I use the hand.\n\n299\n00:14:25.662 --> 00:14:30.865\nAnd you can see when I zoom in past 600%,\nit's gonna give me that pixel preview.\n\n300\n00:14:30.865 --> 00:14:33.165\nNow when I do that,\nI can see a couple things here.\n\n301\n00:14:33.165 --> 00:14:34.439\nSpecifically if I look at my box.\n\n302\n00:14:34.439 --> 00:14:37.205\nSee how those edges\nare a little bit fuzzy?\n\n303\n00:14:37.205 --> 00:14:38.895\nWhat I can do,\nI can go ahead and grab this.\n\n304\n00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:42.698\nAnd there are two fairly newer options\nthat illustrators has added in the top\n\n305\n00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:44.170\nright-hand corner.\n\n306\n00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.090\nI kind of hover over here,\n\n307\n00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.820\nit's just right underneath where\nit says search Adobe stock.\n\n308\n00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.340\nSee how it says align selected\nart to pixel grid, or\n\n309\n00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:56.490\nyou have this option to align art to pixel\ngrid on creation and transformation.\n\n310\n00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.120\nSo, basically, I have the option to\ntake this and align to the pixel grid.\n\n311\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.930\nYou'll see as I go ahead and click that,\nit's gonna get a much more crisp effect.\n\n312\n00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:10.209\nSo now when I go ahead to export this out\nas an image, it's gonna look a lot better.\n\n313\n00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:14.118\n&gt;&gt; It's falling in the actual pixel moat,\nI call it.\n\n314\n00:15:14.118 --> 00:15:16.045\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Because otherwise,\n\n315\n00:15:16.045 --> 00:15:19.620\nit's kinda hanging on, it's got on\nleg in the moat, one leg on the land.\n\n316\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.964\nAnd when you send it out,\n\n317\n00:15:20.964 --> 00:15:24.676\nbecause everything's gonna be in\npixels and screen pixels as well,\n\n318\n00:15:24.676 --> 00:15:27.470\nthat's where it can get a little weird.\nAnd\n\n319\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.370\nthis is one of those ones I've\nalways kind of overlooked.\n\n320\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.290\nAnd then when I started really needing to\ndo stuff for web, and I'm like this makes\n\n321\n00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.170\nit so much easier and so much cleaner-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n322\n00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.770\n&gt;&gt; On the end result.\n\n323\n00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.939\n&gt;&gt; Right, your not taking all this time\ndrawing something that looks great in\n\n324\n00:15:44.939 --> 00:15:48.425\nIllustrator and then exporting it out and\nthen finding it to be a little bit fuzzy.\n\n325\n00:15:48.425 --> 00:15:50.122\nYou do wanna make sure that you use that.\n\n326\n00:15:50.122 --> 00:15:53.284\n&gt;&gt; And your just doing this one square but\nyou could have select all and\n\n327\n00:15:53.284 --> 00:15:54.540\ndo aligned to pixel grid.\n\n328\n00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.773\n&gt;&gt; Or I could do align to pixel grid on\ncreation and transformation, turn that\n\n329\n00:15:58.773 --> 00:16:03.359\non And that's going to do everything,\nas I draw it, it's going to align it all.\n\n330\n00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:06.188\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so,\nno matter where you're drawing it,\n\n331\n00:16:06.188 --> 00:16:08.709\nit's gonna put it in\nthe moat automatically.\n\n332\n00:16:08.709 --> 00:16:09.496\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the moat.\n\n333\n00:16:09.496 --> 00:16:12.830\n[LAUGH] The moat ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's what we're going with.\n\n334\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.410\nNow, I wanted to show you real quick,\n\n335\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.270\njust the difference between how that\nworked on my square, which had very\n\n336\n00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.540\nstraight edges to it, versus if I try and\ndo that on this little wave here, so,\n\n337\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.420\nI'm gonna to turn off the aligned\non creation and transformation.\n\n338\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.540\nIf I try and align selected art to\npixel grade, selected art contains,\n\n339\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.081\nselected art cannot be made\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n340\n00:16:34.081 --> 00:16:35.159\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna learn\n\n341\n00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:37.188\nto read one of these days, so.\n\n342\n00:16:37.188 --> 00:16:39.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can see it, yeah.\n\n343\n00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you got what it said,\nbasically, they cannot happen.\n\n344\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.990\nAnd the reason why is that doesn't have\nany straight edges to it, so, just know\n\n345\n00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.260\nthat this is something that's gonna\nwork a little bit better on something\n\n346\n00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.110\nthat can actually fit into a grid,\nright, this wave cannot fit into a grid.\n\n347\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.960\nSo, we have that, that's kind of one thing\nwe're working with, now the other thing,\n\n348\n00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.840\ntalking about, kind of the, I'm not gonna\nsay the newer way to save our files,\n\n349\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.675\ncuz I'm not trying to make Vonne\nfeel like an old lady here, but-\n\n350\n00:17:05.675 --> 00:17:07.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.110\n&gt;&gt; Tomorrow is my birthday and\n\n352\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:14.985\nI'm not gonna tell you, well, I'm not very\nhappy about this one, so, yes, proceed.\n\n353\n00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:18.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Girl, you know, you're just getting\n\n354\n00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.310\nwiser, so, [LAUGH] what I have here\nis I have the flower shop logo.\n\n355\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.150\nNow a couple things I want to look at,\nfirst, let's go ahead and go back into our\n\n356\n00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:31.250\nfile export, but this time, I'm gonna\nchoose Export for Screens, so if I\n\n357\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.870\ndo File, Export, Export for Screens, this\nis gonna be Illustrator's newer version,\n\n358\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.852\nessentially, of Save for Web, if you're\naccustomed to that in any other programs,\n\n359\n00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:42.620\nit was in Photoshop and\na couple other places, as well.\n\n360\n00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.090\nSo if I do File, Export for\nScreens, you're gonna see here,\n\n361\n00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:50.900\nokay, it's gonna pull up my art boards,\nit's also gonna give me all of these,\n\n362\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.100\nthere's a lot of things\nwe're looking at here.\n\n363\n00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.010\nSo, first of all,\nyou remember that all arrange\n\n364\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.670\nthat Vonne mentioned in our last example\nwith just a regular file export as?\n\n365\n00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.320\nThat's also an option here.\n\n366\n00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.901\nExport to, this is going to be where\nsomething is saved on my computer, so,\n\n367\n00:18:05.901 --> 00:18:10.627\nyou can see, okay, mine's user ZDavis\n06 [SOUND] You can click on that folder\n\n368\n00:18:10.627 --> 00:18:13.562\nicon if you need to choose\na different location,\n\n369\n00:18:13.562 --> 00:18:16.314\nthis is one that I feel\nlike is easy to ignore.\n\n370\n00:18:16.314 --> 00:18:20.470\nI do it all the time cuz it's not\nthe common way that we're accustomed to\n\n371\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.720\nsaving files.\n\n372\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.190\nAnd so what happens is I'll go and\nI'll save something and\n\n373\n00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.220\nI'll realize it's in a totally\ndifferent place, so make sure,\n\n374\n00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.360\neven though this seems kinda subtle,\nmake sure that you have that there.\n\n375\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.200\nNow, it does also have this Open Location\nafter Export, option, which can be nice,\n\n376\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.700\nso, what I can do now, going down to this\nbottom section here, I can go ahead and\n\n377\n00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:44.020\nchoose my formats that I want and\nVonne is freaking out over here.\n\n378\n00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.370\nI can choose my formats that I\nwant everything to be exported in,\n\n379\n00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.180\nso, kinda way the Vonne\nwas doing it before,\n\n380\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.010\nwe had to kinda do each of\nthese individually, right?\n\n381\n00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.010\nI had to do a JPEG, as 300 PPI,\nthen I had to do, something else,\n\n382\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:02.340\na PNG as such and such resolution.\n\n383\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.070\nI can go through here,\nI can pick, okay, one time,\n\n384\n00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.140\none x that's gonna be the scale,\nthat it is beginning, I can do 2x,\n\n385\n00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:13.340\nwhich would be twice the size,\nI can do to the width, height, resolution.\n\n386\n00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.250\nGo ahead and type in something\nlike 72 PPI, go ahead and\n\n387\n00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:22.070\ntype in you know maybe I want a jpeg 100\nand I can choose all of these export ops,\n\n388\n00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.630\nI'm really just loving watching\nVonne freak out right here.\n\n389\n00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can choose all of these\n\n390\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.935\nexport options,\nwhich saves you a lot of time.\n\n391\n00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm over here almost crying\n\n392\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.580\nbecause I don't know if\nit's tears of joy or\n\n393\n00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.190\nsadness that I've been doing\nit the wrong way for so long,\n\n394\n00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:44.470\nit's just like, this is a great birthday\npresent, I wanna tell you right now.\n\n395\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.130\n&gt;&gt; Happy birthday.\n\n396\n00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.340\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, this is crazy.\n\n397\n00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.664\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nI'm glad I could get you something good.\n\n398\n00:19:48.664 --> 00:19:49.564\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.\n\n399\n00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.744\n&gt;&gt; This is all I got you,\nI hate to say that.\n\n400\n00:19:51.744 --> 00:19:52.938\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n401\n00:19:52.938 --> 00:19:57.990\nas you can see we're working with here, we\nalso, have these iOS and Android settings,\n\n402\n00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.630\nso, if you have, if you are going\nto be working on those devices,\n\n403\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.790\nit kinda has those presets available for\nyou.\n\n404\n00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.160\nNow you also have here,\n\n405\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.240\nyou have this prefix that's just\ngonna help you with your file naming.\n\n406\n00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.080\nYou still wanna make sure that you\nhave your files named properly in\n\n407\n00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.960\nyour art board panel, because that's\ngonna impact how they're saved, so,\n\n408\n00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.560\nsee how they're calling\nthis artboard1 here?\n\n409\n00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.470\nEven though you can\nactually change it now,\n\n410\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.650\nwhich again is gonna freak Vonne out, too?\n\n411\n00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.560\nSo, I can go ahead and\ncall this flowers whole, I don't know,\n\n412\n00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.040\ncuz I'm using the whole artboard.\n\n413\n00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.760\nI could change that there, but\nI could also add a prefix to this,\n\n414\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.300\nso if I had multiple files, there's\ndifferent things, now see, we're working\n\n415\n00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.544\non artboards right now, you see also this\nother little guy over here called Assets?\n\n416\n00:20:37.544 --> 00:20:40.530\nSomething else that's pretty fun, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Cancel, but\n\n417\n00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.210\nyou could see how this would work for\nexporting out an entire art board.\n\n418\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:48.550\nNow, my Asset Export panel,\nthis is like going back to\n\n419\n00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.230\nthe things that Taylor was asking us, what\nare our favorite things in Illustrator?\n\n420\n00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.070\nAnd we were like, yeah, we kinda like\nthe lame thing, well I don't know, I like\n\n421\n00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.640\nthe colors, but, this one is pretty cool\nbecause it's gonna save you a lot of time.\n\n422\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.610\nSo, what I can do, is I can, basically,\nnow take graphics individually and\n\n423\n00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.658\njust tell Illustrator,okay, I want this\nas one, I want this as another one,\n\n424\n00:21:08.658 --> 00:21:14.280\nthis, so on and so forth and just drag and\ndrop them into this Asset Export Panel.\n\n425\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.910\nAnd it's basically just a way for\n\n426\n00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.650\nyou to define each of your different\ngraphics that you have working with.\n\n427\n00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.100\nYou can go ahead and give them a name, so\nI can click on where it said asset two,\n\n428\n00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.170\nand give that a name and\nI can call that Flower Shop.\n\n429\n00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.920\nAnd that will, basically, be again,\nthe same thing that we will use when we\n\n430\n00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.120\nare exporting our files, so, we'll go\nahead and title that file, Flower Shop.\n\n431\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.910\nNow, yes, you can see the export settings\ndown below here and that's basically gonna\n\n432\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.620\nbe the same thing that we were looking\nat here, so, I have those dimensions,\n\n433\n00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.330\nyou can add a suffix, I can also see\nall of the different file types.\n\n434\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:52.240\nNow, we call this the newer method, now,\nnote some of these file types are missing,\n\n435\n00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.350\nso, there's not like a TIF option that you\nhave there, so, now if you still need to\n\n436\n00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.870\nexport in those types of files, you're\nstill gonna have to do the file export as.\n\n437\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:07.540\nSo, Vonne's way, is still very much alive,\nso, I do really want to point that out.\n\n438\n00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.620\nBut, what I really, really like about\nthis, okay and you can add scale and\n\n439\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.090\nthere is an IOS and Android.\n\n440\n00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.610\nWhat I really,\n\n441\n00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:17.330\nreally like about this is, this does\nnot have to be a finished product.\n\n442\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.983\nI can go here and let's say, I'm working\nin a live paint group here, so, maybe I'll\n\n443\n00:22:21.983 --> 00:22:28.280\njust change the, This color rather\nthan having jumped into my Live Paint.\n\n444\n00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.530\nYou see, how that,\nwhen I change the color,\n\n445\n00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.810\nit's updating in my Asset Export Panel?\n\n446\n00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:39.290\nSo, as I continue to work,\nit will continue to update,\n\n447\n00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.640\nnow, here's the only caveat.\n\n448\n00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.450\nIf I have exported this out,\nso, if I've selected this and\n\n449\n00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.440\nyou can actually export right from this\npanel you don't have to go to a file save\n\n450\n00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.580\nas, see all the way at\nthe bottom where it says export,\n\n451\n00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.440\nI can choose that option now without\nhaving to go into my file export.\n\n452\n00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.420\nIf I had exported this out and\nI've already saved it as a jpeg,\n\n453\n00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.740\nit's not gonna resave my jpeg but\nwhat I do is if I'm working on something.\n\n454\n00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.090\nI would go ahead and\nmaybe just drag that over and\n\n455\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.670\nthen as I continue to work and let's be\nhonest, I fiddle with colors all day long.\n\n456\n00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:16.290\nI'll probably change something 25\ntimes before I feel good about it,\n\n457\n00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.940\nit's constantly updating\nin my asset export panel.\n\n458\n00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.840\nSo, I don't have to worry about saying,\nokay That's gonna change.\n\n459\n00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.510\nAnd then the nice thing about\nit is if I go ahead and\n\n460\n00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.620\nsave my native file,\nI save my AI file, next time I open up\n\n461\n00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.500\nmy AI file all of those assets are still\ngonna be there for me to work with.\n\n462\n00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.860\nSo I can if I need to if my\nclient says you know what\n\n463\n00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.480\nWe're gonna ditch the blue on the logo.\n\n464\n00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.390\nWe need to go ahead and\nupdate it to red or whatever.\n\n465\n00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.720\nI can go ahead and change that,\nand then it's still gonna be in my\n\n466\n00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.800\nasset export panel for\nme to very easily update that.\n\n467\n00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.250\nThe export settings are usually\nstill there as well, so\n\n468\n00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:57.240\nif I had 20 different things here and\nI wanted to go ahead and\n\n469\n00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.130\njust use the same ones It's gonna\nkeep all that there for me.\n\n470\n00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:07.716\nSo, I basically just tell you this so\nI can shock Vaughn is what I'm going for.\n\n471\n00:24:07.716 --> 00:24:13.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is amazing.\n\n472\n00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.740\nI mean, I'm so,\n\n473\n00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:19.140\nI'm actually really glad that we left,\nwe made this the last episode.\n\n474\n00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.790\nBecause I think I might cry.\n\n475\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.560\nI think [LAUGH].\n\n476\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.760\nOnly because this is so just amazing and\nbecause this is right up my alley.\n\n477\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.730\nI love file formats.\n\n478\n00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.490\nI love all this stuff.\n\n479\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.860\nI almost don't know what to do with\nmyself, that this is Like I said,\n\n480\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.300\nall these things I've been doing for\nall these years and\n\n481\n00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.585\nthe long way I was doing it, it's like\nAdobe knows how we're doing this stuff.\n\n482\n00:24:41.585 --> 00:24:42.881\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they pay attention.\n\n483\n00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:44.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n484\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.660\nI know that you're going to be doing all\nsorts of stuff with your illustrator files\n\n485\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.250\nand where you're going to be exporting\nthem to and pieces of it and logos, and\n\n486\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.550\nthey just made it so\nmuch easier for us, and that's\n\n487\n00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:02.375\nAbsolutely mind-blowing to me and\nI'm so excited.\n\n488\n00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:04.290\n[LAUGH] I just can't hide it!\n\n489\n00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.135\nI'm about to lose control and\nI think I like it.\n\n490\n00:25:07.135 --> 00:25:09.040\n[LAUGH] I know, I'm sorry,\nI couldn't help it.\n\n491\n00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You had to go there.\n\n492\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.635\n&gt;&gt; I did, I did, well, I\n&gt;&gt; I'm so\n\n493\n00:25:11.635 --> 00:25:17.545\nglad that you were here to show\nan old girl

Vaughn.\n\n496\n00:25:23.834 --> 00:25:25.615\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So anytime I can I'm\n\n497\n00:25:25.615 --> 00:25:26.315\nlike\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n498\n00:25:26.315 -->
