Hello.\nI'm feeling very expert-y.\n\n12\n00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Y'all make me feel so\n\n13\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.310\nsmart with that title.\n\n14\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.260\nI love it.\n\n15\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.960\nI love it.\n\n16\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.830\nBut yes, so excited.\n\n17\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.580\nI love Illustrator.\n\n18\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n19\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.740\nYou know, I know,\n\n20\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.970\nIllustrator is Is our fave.\nWe've been together for a while.\n\n21\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.100\n&gt;&gt; We have a history.\n\n22\n00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo you know how much I love this product\n\n23\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.340\nand I know how much you love this product\nand this is our introduction Correct.\n\n24\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna start from scratch\n\n25\n00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.287\nlike assuming no knowledge,\nyou don't know what even does.\n\n26\n00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:06.098\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n27\n00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:09.658\nwell, you are going to help that.\n\n28\n00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:12.238\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's your job now string over.\n\n29\n00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, take over here.\n\n30\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.252\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n31\n00:01:15.252 --> 00:01:18.890\nTalk about She is great about\ninterjecting and adding her own tips.\n\n32\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.230\nAnd Vonne was my teacher first, so\nthat's kind of the funny story here,\n\n33\n00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.600\nthat the student becomes the teacher.\n\n34\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.550\nBut yes, as we discussed,\nIllustrator is just a fantastic program.\n\n35\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.390\nIt's definitely something where, if I can\njump into one of the Adobe programs, and\n\n36\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.190\nI can do anything In any program, each\none of them kinda has their own niche.\n\n37\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.730\nWe'll get into that.\n\n38\n00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.360\nIllustrator is always\ngonna be my first choice.\n\n39\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.190\nIt's just gonna be kinda my go-to program.\n\n40\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.080\nBecause it's just fun.\n\n41\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.800\nIt's fun, and\n\n42\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.560\nfeel like it's one of the ones that\ncan be a little bit easier to learn.\n\n43\n00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.890\nSo that's kind of a nice thing with it.\n\n44\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.070\n&gt;&gt; It's slightly more\nintuitive in the sense that\n\n45\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.990\n&gt;&gt; Paint, you know when we all first got\n\n46\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.580\nour computers back in the day, gosh,\nI'm showing my age already [LAUGH] Well,\n\n47\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.970\nyou know you had to like,\nI can draw with a paint brush and\n\n48\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.980\nyou go ahead and pick a color and\nthings like that.\n\n49\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.970\nSo I feel like it's kinda\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like the new\n\n50\n00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.350\ngraduated person if you want to say\nfrom like the little baby Paint and\n\n51\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.110\nnow it's in illustrator and\nwhat you can do with it.\n\n52\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.160\nSo I think that's the thing that people\nmaybe feel more comfortable with.\n\n53\n00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; If you've grown up with computers or\n\n54\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.330\nanything like that.\n\n55\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think that's a great example.\n\n56\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.760\nTo kind of explain what that means let's\ngo ahead and take a look at my screen now.\n\n57\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.160\nI don't have Illustrator open.\n\n58\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.920\nWe are looking at something\nthat I created in Illustrator,\n\n59\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.460\nbut we're just gonna look at\nit as a PDF for right now.\n\n60\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.140\nSo you kind of are seeing some words,\nvector, raster.\n\n61\n00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.820\nIt's like, what does that mean?\n\n62\n00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.250\nAnd if you've never opened up\nIllustrator before, You may not know.\n\n63\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.100\nEven if you have, you may not\nnecessarily know what you're creating.\n\n64\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.000\nSo Illustrator is a vector based program.\n\n65\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.540\nNow what does that mean?\n\n66\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.060\nBasically, the reason why we use\nIllustrator, especially for something like\n\n67\n00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.310\na logo is because With a vector-based\nprogram, it's all based up on math.\n\n68\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.560\nWhich you're probably thinking,\nlike I am, no, I'm in the wrong spot.\n\n69\n00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.970\nThis is not why I came to\nthis job was to do math.\n\n70\n00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.550\nWell, the computer program\ndoes all the math for you, but\n\n71\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.310\nit makes everything infinitely scalable.\n\n72\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.670\nNow compare that to\nsomething like an image.\n\n73\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.680\nSo if I'm making an image in Photoshop,\nAll that is based on pixels.\n\n74\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.330\nSo if you kinda look at\nthis raster versus vector.\n\n75\n00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.810\nKinda looking at what that means.\n\n76\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.350\nSo raster based images,\nalso known as bitmap,\n\n77\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.750\nare all gonna be things that\nreally depend on resolution.\n\n78\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.720\nAnd you can think about, okay,\nit's built up on this many pixels.\n\n79\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.130\nIf I try and blow it up you're\ngonna get that pixellated effect.\n\n80\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.910\nEven if you're new to the concept of\nresolution you've probably seen something\n\n81\n00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.230\nthat looks a little bit\npixellated before in your life.\n\n82\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.300\nRight?\n\n83\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n84\n00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.800\n&gt;&gt; And you might even see this on social\n\n85\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.970\nmedia or anywhere that you\nhave images on a screen or\n\n86\n00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.940\neven in a printed material\nwhere it just looks.\n\n87\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.950\nFuzzy-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n88\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.800\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look clear and\nit's pixellated.\n\n89\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.840\nAnd these are just kind of, I feel,\ncommon terms that nowadays that we\n\n90\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.295\nhave with anything that involves an image,\nthat maybe you've even heard of a j.\n\n91\n00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:14.205\nFile we threw some file formats up there.\n\n92\n00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:16.725\nDon't have to worry about what\neach one of them means, but\n\n93\n00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:20.375\nyou might of heard of a jpg file because\nwe're always sharing pictures and\n\n94\n00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:23.935\nposting them on Instagram or\nFacebook or anywhere else like that and\n\n95\n00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:28.340\nsharing it like that So,\nhopefully you're somewhat familiar with\n\n96\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.930\nthat type of information of\nthat particular type of file,\n\n97\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.205\nand now you have a fancy term,\nthat that is a raster based file format.\n\n98\n00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:38.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah we're just here for\n\n99\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.655\nthe fancy terms, really.\n\n100\n00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:40.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, exactly,\n\n101\n00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.080\nI think Vonne made a good point,\n\n102\n00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.900\nin the digital age, you\n&gt;&gt; Probably have something like\n\n103\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.450\na smart phone.\n\n104\n00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.340\nSo if I take a picture on my iPhone,\nI'm taking a JPEG image to share.\n\n105\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.415\nI think it's a JPEG,\nI'm gonna go with a JPEG.\n\n106\n00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:53.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those that\n\n107\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.060\nyou're looking at here, basically.\n\n108\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.515\nSo it is something.\n\n109\n00:04:56.515 --> 00:04:59.215\n&gt;&gt; Something that you're probably\nare seeing a little bit more commonly now\n\n110\n00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.045\nthan maybe even 10 years ago.\n\n111\n00:05:01.045 --> 00:05:03.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and maybe,\nas we keep on this train, right.\n\n112\n00:05:03.895 --> 00:05:08.185\nI don't know, with my phone I go\nto share picture or I send it,\n\n113\n00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:13.205\nsometimes it pops up with like, do you\nwanna send it as small, medium or large.\n\n114\n00:05:13.205 --> 00:05:16.895\nYou see that a lot, and\nyou are like, I don't know.\n\n115\n00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:18.885\nThat goes back to the whole\nthing that you talked about,\n\n116\n00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:24.070\nthe resolution, All of these\npixels that make up your image.\n\n117\n00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.850\nWell there's amount of pixels, and\n\n118\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.170\nhow much stuff it has in it\nmakes the file size bigger.\n\n119\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.750\nAnd so that's why it's asking you what\nsize, of the small, medium, and large,\n\n120\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.540\nbecause it does something\nthen it's resampling.\n\n121\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.830\nJust go okay sure, that's fine.\n\n122\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.770\nWhatever that means.\n\n123\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.690\nIt's just gonna change\nthe number of pixels but\n\n124\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.660\nit does equate to how large\nthe file itself goes.\n\n125\n00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.270\nSo even if you don't know anything about\n\n126\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.860\nall that stuff you've probably seen\nthat and that's what it's talking about.\n\n127\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyeah exactly that's was a great example.\n\n128\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.630\nThat was the moment I was thinking of\nwhen I thought of you've probably said\n\n129\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.180\nthe JPEG.\n\n130\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.700\nSo yes I'm glad you expanded on that.\n\n131\n00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.950\nSo yeah that's all our\nroster based information.\n\n132\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.840\nNow- Illustrator,\n\n133\n00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.700\nthe one program we're talking about\nhere is a vector-based program.\n\n134\n00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.170\nSo it's basically kind of\nlike the opposite of that.\n\n135\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.230\nNow there is some rounds and\n\n136\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.120\nstuff that can go in there but\nthat's a different story.\n\n137\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.730\nWe'll just leave it at that.\n\n138\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.000\nSo with our vectors, we have everything\nknown as Pass, there are no pixels.\n\n139\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.010\nAnd as I mentioned,\nthis is resolution independent.\n\n140\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.060\nAnd also fun fact, I just noticed that\nthis is spanning onto two lines, and\n\n141\n00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.580\nit's driving me crazy [LAUGH].\n\n142\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.280\nSo we do not have to work with resolution\nlike we do in our raster based images.\n\n143\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.350\nSo it's very different from an image\nthat you take on your phone or\n\n144\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.640\nsomething like that.\n\n145\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.760\nAnd Illustrator is going to be\nthe program that we would use.\n\n146\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.510\nTo create these raster graphics.\n\n147\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.730\nNow, when we look at something like that,\nokay,\n\n148\n00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.920\nif I kinda move over here we have our\nvectors, as I said, vectors are all based\n\n149\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.720\non a mathematical formula that is going\nto allow them to be infinitely scalable.\n\n150\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.340\nSo, I kinda mentioned this example before,\n\n151\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.930\nbut, Illustrator is a common program\nthat I would use to create a logo.\n\n152\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.660\nNow why would I use\nIllustrator to create a logo?\n\n153\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.170\nThat's probably something that I need to\nhave in several different sizes, right?\n\n154\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.170\nSo, you can think about a logo on\nsomething as small as a pen, and then,\n\n155\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.880\nokay, a pocket square of a T-shirt,\nor kinda labeled on a T-shirt.\n\n156\n00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.670\nThen I need something as\nlarge as a billboard.\n\n157\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.740\nI can create that infinitely,\nscalable graphic in Illustrator.\n\n158\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.720\nIf I were trying to make that\nup with pixels in Photoshop,\n\n159\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.220\nit would get pixellated.\n\n160\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.190\nYou know,\nthat resolution would start to look fuzzy.\n\n161\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.240\nI think fuzzy is a great word for\ndescribing it.\n\n162\n00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.100\nAnd a lot of times,\njust kind of a fun fact,\n\n163\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:39.340\noften times this utilizes a smaller file\nsize because we don't have those pixels.\n\n164\n00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.180\nAnd that resolution that information for\nthe computer to kind of remember\n\n165\n00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.880\nwe are basically all just\nworking of mathematical formula.\n\n166\n00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.780\nNow I have this graphic here don't\nlet this you know scare you or\n\n167\n00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.090\nanything like that but I basically just\nwanna explain the types of things that we\n\n168\n00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.360\nare gonna be looking at in illustrator.\n\n169\n00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.900\nSo I think I mentioned the word\nalready illustrator, in.\n\n170\n00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.170\nBleh.\n[LAUGH] Illustrator creates what's known\n\n171\n00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.800\nas paths.\n\n172\n00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.830\nSo, typically when we're referring\nto an object like a triangle,\n\n173\n00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.370\nlike what we're looking at here.\n\n174\n00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.490\nTechnically it's going to\nbe referred to as a path.\n\n175\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.830\nYou may hear us use the word object,\nor something kind of similar to that.\n\n176\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.980\nAnd then our paths are based off of these.\n\n177\n00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.120\nPoints, so you're going to see that we\nhave this point here, this point here.\n\n178\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.710\nthis point here.\n\n179\n00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.140\nA triangle's naturally going to be\nthree points, a square might be four,\n\n180\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:25.800\nsomething like that.\n\n181\n00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.320\nYou can kind of see how that would work,\n\n182\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.600\njust based of the idea of just drawing\na square, you have four corners.\n\n183\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.560\nYou're probably gonna have\na corner in each point.\n\n184\n00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.580\nYou could have more,\nwe'll kinda get into that.\n\n185\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.390\nAnd then we also,\n\n186\n00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.230\nwith our color, we typically have\nwhat's known as a fill versus a stroke.\n\n187\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.640\nSo what we're looking at here,\nthis is known as our Fill color,\n\n188\n00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.900\nwhere we have kinda that teal there.\n\n189\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.060\nAnd then we also have this stroke\nwhere we have that kind of\n\n190\n00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.940\noutside border along there with it.\n\n191\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.820\nSo this is predominantly the type\nof thing that you're gonna\n\n192\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.980\nbe looking at in Illustrator.\n\n193\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.770\n&gt;&gt; And here we're really just trying\nto introduce you to the terms.\n\n194\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.710\nFill.\nStroke.\n\n195\n00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.350\nPoints.\n\n196\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.620\nPaths.\n\n197\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.590\nLike she said, we'll kinda refer to\nthem as shapes, cuz it is a shape.\n\n198\n00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.400\nA triangle is a shape, but\ntechnically it's a path.\n\n199\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.890\nAnd even more technically,\n\n200\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.700\nit's a closed path versus an open path,\na line that has two points.\n\n201\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.880\nThen that's an open path and\nthis is a closed path.\n\n202\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.590\nSo you can see in the inside fill,\noutside stroke.\n\n203\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.170\nAnd we even say the inside\ncolor sometimes.\n\n204\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.910\nWe kind of use it interchangeably\nof We commonly referred to in our\n\n205\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.630\nregular vocabulary versus\nthe technical definitions of\n\n206\n00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.730\nthe make up a path and everything.\n\n207\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.150\nAnd if this is harking back to some of\nyour geometry lessons and everything and\n\n208\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.700\nmaybe you're like, gosh I'm so scared.\n\n209\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.980\nGeometry actually my favorite\n\n210\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.248\nmath class ever because\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n211\n00:09:49.248 --> 00:09:50.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; we made shapes.\n\n212\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.820\nSo I was kinda excited.\n\n213\n00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.275\nThe proofs were a little weird but\nI still like those too.\n\n214\n00:09:54.275 --> 00:09:56.752\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Geometry was not my favorite\n\n215\n00:09:56.752 --> 00:09:57.270\nsubject\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.290\n&gt;&gt; In school, and I still like working in\n\n217\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.545\nIllustrator Working in Illustrator, so\neven if you're not crazy like Vonne and\n\n218\n00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:06.935\nlove geometry, you will still,\nI think, enjoy it.\n\n219\n00:10:06.935 --> 00:10:11.275\nTrust me and I really think Vonne made a\ngreat point earlier, it kind of harks back\n\n220\n00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:14.670\nto some of that almost childhood\n&gt;&gt; Painting,\n\n221\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.070\ndrawing a square, drawing a triangle.\n\n222\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.030\nThat's a lot of the stuff, especially\nwhen we're first getting started in\n\n223\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.610\nIllustrator, that we're gonna be doing.\n\n224\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.200\nSo I really think that it will\nbe kinda fun in that regard.\n\n225\n00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.190\nNow I'm sure we'll have a couple\nother things to add, but\n\n226\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.400\nI don't wanna miss the common uses here.\n\n227\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.860\nTypically, a lot of times people want\nto know the common uses of the various\n\n228\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.110\ndifferent programs, so we went ahead and\nlisted a couple of them here.\n\n229\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.610\nObviously, I have a lot more for\n\n230\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.200\nIllustrator just cause we're\ntalking about Illustrator.\n\n231\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.120\nI'm not saying that Photoshop and\nInDesign are just limited to those\n\n232\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.060\nThose couple things nor is illustrator\nlook-limited to just these couple things.\n\n233\n00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.650\nBut all right, typically, your gonna\nuse illustrator to create graphics, so\n\n234\n00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.780\nyou can think about okay,\na logo, I've got a map.\n\n235\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.560\nIllustrations, if I'm doing some\nsort of a cartoon Soon or drawing.\n\n236\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.820\nInfographics, you might use Illustrator to\ncreate the infographic in its entirety or\n\n237\n00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.720\nmaybe you use Illustrator to create just\nthe little pieces of an infographic.\n\n238\n00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.350\nAnd then kind of compile it in\na different program, which is yeah.\n\n239\n00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.200\n&gt;&gt; A little more complicated but yeah,\nit is something that you could do.\n\n240\n00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nif your like what's an infographic?\n\n241\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of all the rage right now or\n\n242\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:27.510\nmaybe it's all rage for\nus cuz we're in the design world but\n\n243\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.850\nyou see them even in social media.\n\n244\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.810\nWhere it's A lot of times like a long\ngraphic and it's being able to\n\n245\n00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:40.420\nmake information into\na visual format where it\n\n246\n00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.850\nhas chats and graphs and\nlike 40% of all bunnies are gray.\n\n247\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.170\nThose types of things and then it has like\nlittle bunnies here and like little furs\n\n248\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:54.340\nand everything all colors and It's very,\nwhat you call, flat colors all the time.\n\n249\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; When we say flat colors,\n\n250\n00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.560\nthere's no shading and\ngrades, like right here.\n\n251\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.540\nThis is flat colors.\n\n252\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.084\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's all flat colors.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's all teal,\n\n253\n00:12:03.084 --> 00:12:05.023\nyou got some purples in the corners and\n\n254\n00:12:05.023 --> 00:12:07.758\nsome yellows Again we're\nthrowing up design terms.\n\n255\n00:12:07.758 --> 00:12:09.803\nThat maybe you haven't heard of but\n\n256\n00:12:09.803 --> 00:12:12.975\njust trying to get you talking\nthe lingo of a designer.\n\n257\n00:12:12.975 --> 00:12:15.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like, is she gonna go lingo?\n\n258\n00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.480\nHow far out is she gonna go?\n\n259\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.480\nI like it, I like it.\n\n260\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.940\nOkay, but yeah I agree.\n\n261\n00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.753\nThose are all just kinda terms that we\nwill probably discuss throughout this\n\n262\n00:12:23.753 --> 00:12:27.641\nshow, talking about all those things,\nlike flat color and stuff like that.\n\n263\n00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:31.518\nAnd you can see, we have some other\nexamples listed here, T-shirts, flyers,\n\n264\n00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:33.182\na lot of times for a business card.\n\n265\n00:12:33.182 --> 00:12:36.543\nI'll mock up the initial\nbusiness card in Illustrator And\n\n266\n00:12:36.543 --> 00:12:41.385\nthen maybe move it into In Design and\nuse some of the skills that you can there.\n\n267\n00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:46.294\nInDesign to kind of lead into that is\nmore of a multi page layout program.\n\n268\n00:12:46.294 --> 00:12:49.418\nIt is something where if I was\ntasked with designing a book or\n\n269\n00:12:49.418 --> 00:12:52.800\nreally anything that was more\nthan probably two or three pages.\n\n270\n00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.510\nI would definitely use In Design for\nthat because that's What it's set up for.\n\n271\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.650\nIt's set up to handle a lot of text and\n\n272\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.100\na lot of content, including images and\nthings like that.\n\n273\n00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.730\nNow Photoshop, Photoshop I feel like is\nalways the name people know, right and so\n\n274\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.760\na lot of times people kinda have\nan idea about that program.\n\n275\n00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.000\nWell Photoshop at it's core\nis an image Editing programs.\n\n276\n00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.180\nI think a lot of times\npeople do use Photoshop for\n\n277\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.330\nthings that they really\nshould use Illustrator for.\n\n278\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.660\nEspecially, if they're just starting\n[INAUDIBLE] kinda new to the program.\n\n279\n00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.640\nHopefully, we can kinda show you.\n\n280\n00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.790\nAnd may be if you are one of those\nphotoshoppers we can kinda take\n\n281\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.960\nyou from that.\n\n282\n00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.660\nAnd take you into Illustrator at least for\n\n283\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.030\nthe things that Illustrator\nshould be used for.\n\n284\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.162\nI am definitely an advocate for\nusing each program properly.\n\n285\n00:13:39.162 --> 00:13:42.588\nYou know if I am working on a logo then\nthat's something I'm gonna make in\n\n286\n00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:45.239\nIllustrator and\nthen you know maybe if I wanna go ahead.\n\n287\n00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:48.653\nAnd add that to an image or\nadd that to a website mock up,\n\n288\n00:13:48.653 --> 00:13:52.400\nwhich I could do a website\nmock up in Illustrator too.\n\n289\n00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.830\nI just know a lot of people use that for\n\n290\n00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.260\nPhotoshop maybe then I would\ntake that into Photoshop, but\n\n291\n00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.205\nyou have to use each thing properly for\nwhat it What it was designed for.\n\n292\n00:14:01.205 --> 00:14:03.346\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, I couldn't agree more.\n\n293\n00:14:03.346 --> 00:14:06.632\nLike Photoshop, I would do,\nsay I took some pictures, but\n\n294\n00:14:06.632 --> 00:14:09.674\nthey're kind of dark and\nI wanna change the contrast.\n\n295\n00:14:09.674 --> 00:14:14.271\nAnd the shadow and highlights and\nI need to get rid of that big old\n\n296\n00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:16.067\npimple on my face [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n297\n00:14:16.067 --> 00:14:18.336\n&gt;&gt; You go ahead and\nuse Photoshop to edit the image.\n\n298\n00:14:18.336 --> 00:14:21.335\nI would use illustrator\nto create the logo for\n\n299\n00:14:21.335 --> 00:14:25.850\nthe company in it's vector format like\nyou said, to be able to put on a T-shirt,\n\n300\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.250\na pen, all of our logos,\nthey're all done in Illustrator.\n\n301\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then put it onside a building but\n\n302\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.310\nthen designing a four page
