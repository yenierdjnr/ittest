00:00:17.847\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:20.620\ntoday we're gonna be going\nover Adobe Illustrator CC.\n\n5\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.760\nOne of many programs available Within\nthe good old Creative Cloud suite.\n\n6\n00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.920\nAnd here to help us tell us all\nabout the program, what we can do,\n\n7\n00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.050\nand how to use it, is Ms.\nVonne Smith, how's it going Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.450\n>> Good, I'm so excited to be\nhere to talk about Illustrator\n\n9\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.050\nwhich is one of my favorite programs.\n\n10\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.010\nIt actually truly is one of my favorite\nprograms, I use it constantly.\n\n11\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.610\nAnd, it's awesome so I'm really glad\nto be able to share this all with you.\n\n12\n00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.570\nFirst of all, what is Illustrator?\n\n13\n00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.800\nIllustrator is the vector editing\nprogram within the creative suite.\n\n14\n00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.255\nIt is It is used to edit vector artwork,\n\n15\n00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.295\ncreate vector artwork, everything\nvectors is what you use Illustrator for.\n\n16\n00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:05.875\nSo, what is a vector?\n\n17\n00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:09.105\n>> That was my next question,\nVonne, what the heck is a vector?\n\n18\n00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:12.840\n>> Exactly, so,\nwhen you hear the word vector,\n\n19\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.700\nyou actually think of math which\nusually starts to scare people.\n\n20\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.220\nYou know, [LAUGH] I don't wanna\ndo addition or subtraction or\n\n21\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.270\nany of that kind of stuff.\n\n22\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.642\nSo, it's actually more like geometry.\n\n23\n00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:23.776\nDo you remember geometry?\n\n24\n00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:24.670\n>> Way back when.\n\n25\n00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.278\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:26.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're going a little back on that one.\n\n27\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.590\nBut, that was actually one of my\nfavorite math classes because it was\n\n28\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.423\nmore spatial and it was drawing shapes.\n\n29\n00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:38.980\nRemember drawing the isosceles\ntriangle is that one right there?\n\n30\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.850\n>> That is an equal something triangle.\n\n31\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.763\n>> We'll go with that yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:44.902\n[LAUGH] We'll go equilateral.\n\n33\n00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:46.123\n>> I told you-\n>> I think that's what it was.\n\n34\n00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:47.710\n>> It's been a long time\nsince I did geometry.\n\n35\n00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.254\n>> Exactly so we'll go with that so\n\n36\n00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:52.067\nthe equal sides I think that's\nan equilateral triangle.\n\n37\n00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:52.764\nAll right, wonderful.\n\n38\n00:01:52.764 --> 00:01:54.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n39\n00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.520\nthat's basically what you're creating\nwhen you're creating Illustrator.\n\n40\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.380\nYou're creating shapes,\nyou're creating lines and curves and arcs.\n\n41\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.680\nAnd the word that you always use\nwith vectors is the word path,\n\n42\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.740\nwe're creating vector paths in\nIllustrator, and those path have points\n\n43\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.110\nalong the way and you can have open paths,\nclose paths, all things like that.\n\n44\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.560\nWhen you're working with shapes,\nyou have insides and outsides.\n\n45\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.520\nLike if I'm looking at this triangle,\nI would say that it has a blue inside and\n\n46\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.010\na darker blue outside.\n\n47\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.307\nThe technical term is fills and strokes,\nyou have the insides and the outsides.\n\n48\n00:02:34.307 --> 00:02:41.270\nSo that's what you use when you're talking\nabout vector graphics within Illustrator.\n\n49\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.130\n>> Okay.\n\n50\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.030\n>> The cool thing about\nvector graphics is that\n\n51\n00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.920\nyou don't have any resolution like\nyou have with raster graphics\n\n52\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.690\nwhich we'll talk a little more in\nthe next slide about the differences.\n\n53\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.620\nSo you use vectors to\nwhere you can scale up.\n\n54\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.800\nActually, let's move on\nto vectors vs raster.\n\n55\n00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.240\nWhen I say the word raster,\nyou're thinking of an actual picture.\n\n56\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.830\nLike a picture of a cat, or a bunny,\nor anything to that effect.\n\n57\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.840\nIt is made up of pixels and when you have\npixels you are resolution dependent.\n\n58\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.575\nIt depends on the resolution of\nwhatever space you’re going into.\n\n59\n00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.800\nWhen I mean space I'm talking about\nwhether you’re working in web or\n\n60\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.350\nyour working in print and that depends.\n\n61\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.970\nAnd have you ever taken a picture, like\noff the Internet or off your camera and\n\n62\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.360\nthen you put it somewhere else and you\ntry to make it bigger and it does what?\n\n63\n00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.280\n>> And it gets all grainy and\nit just loses detail, it gets horrible.\n\n64\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.780\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you try to go too big if\n\n65\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.980\nit starts out too small.\n\n66\n00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.010\n>> Exactly, yes so that's the whole\nthing about raster graphics\n\n67\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.780\nis that you have that resolution and\nthat total number of pixels\n\n68\n00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.710\nthat occupy that space\nof that photograph file.\n\n69\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.510\nThat's all you got for the most part, and\n\n70\n00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.580\nwe use Photoshop to edit\nthose raster graphics.\n\n71\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.660\nIllustrator is used to edit\nthe vector graphics, and\n\n72\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.940\nI have some of those kind of\ncommon file formats on this slide.\n\n73\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.485\nJPG, do these all look\nsomewhat familiar to you?\n\n74\n00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:13.217\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n>> I'm sure JPG is probably one that-\n\n75\n00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:13.720\n>> JPG, GIF, TIFF, yeah.\n\n76\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.500\n>> Everybody probably, now with\ntheir mobile phones and everything,\n\n77\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.230\nyou've got your jpgs, your gifs,\nyour tiffs, your pngs and your bmps.\n\n78\n00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.750\nSo those are all raster graphic formats.\n\n79\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.650\nIllustrator, you have the eps file,\nwhich is an encapsulated postscript file.\n\n80\n00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.306\nThat is probably the most famous,\nif you want to say,\n\n81\n00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:38.870\nof the vector-capable,\nor vector-compatible.\n\n82\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.410\nIt can hold vector information,\nbasically, is the EPS file.\n\n83\n00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.260\nThere's another file format when you're\ntalking about vectors, is the SVG,\n\n84\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.540\nit's a scalable vector graphic.\n\n85\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.610\nAnd also pdf, usually when you're\nthinking of pdfs, you're thinking, right.\n\n86\n00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.710\n>> It makes sense now though,\nbecause I know that I can take a PDF and\n\n87\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.820\nI can scale it up and\nI don't lose the detail.\n\n88\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.638\nNow I know why,\nbecause it's a raster graphic.\n\n89\n00:05:01.638 --> 00:05:02.774\n>> Other one.\n\n90\n00:05:02.774 --> 00:05:03.866\n>> Is it sort of, sorry,\nis it a vector graphic.\n\n91\n00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:05.278\n>> [LAUGH] A vector graphic, yeah.\n\n92\n00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:08.460\nYeah, actually a PDF, a lot of times\nwhen people think of PDFs, its like,\n\n93\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.830\nI'm sending you a file like a Word file or\na contract or something to that effect.\n\n94\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.360\nSo I think people usually equate\nPDFs with text documents.\n\n95\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.840\nBut the PDF file format can actually\nhold a whole bunch of information and\n\n96\n00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.160\nit can support vector graphics.\n\n97\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.100\nSo depending on what is actually in\nthat PDF that you're talking about,\n\n98\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.670\nit could scale but that file format\ncan also hold raster information so\n\n99\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.450\nit does have it's kinda\nlike a both type of thing.\n\n100\n00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.540\nBut on the other side, like a JPEG file,\n\n101\n00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.600\nthat doesn't support vectors like you\ncan not have any vector information\n\n102\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.980\nin that file format, as along with any\nof those other raster file formats.\n\n103\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.430\nThe vector files formats\ncan support vectors.\n\n104\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.510\n>> Good.\n>> That's how it works.\n\n105\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.520\n>> Nice.\n>> All right.\n\n106\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.420\nWonderful.\n\n107\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.440\nSo, I wanted to talk a little bit about\nsome of the other products that are in\n\n108\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.580\nthe Adobe Suite,\nbecause these three products\n\n109\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.820\nto me are the trifecta of everything for\ngraphic design.\n\n110\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.365\nThere's others in the creative suite.\n\n111\n00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:16.680\nBut these to me are like the big guys\nwhen you're talking about actual\n\n112\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.510\ngraphic design,\nI think I just said that twice.\n\n113\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.444\nOkay, so you have Photoshop right,\nI think we had mentioned that before.\n\n114\n00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:26.797\nThat is your raster editing program,\nyou take your files or\n\n115\n00:06:26.797 --> 00:06:30.953\nyou take your photographs, you edit,\nyou put the mustache on your cat and\n\n116\n00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:32.310\neverything like that.\n\n117\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.690\nYou put the bunny ears on your friends and\nyou swap faces or whatever you're doing.\n\n118\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.650\nAnd so you edit those in Photoshop.\n\n119\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.290\nThen you can take any type of\nraster images that you create\n\n120\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.070\nin Photoshop and you can use them as\n\n121\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.250\nthose images within your different\npublications that you might create.\n\n122\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.200\nOkay so then on the other side we\nhave InDesign versus Illustrator.\n\n123\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.230\nWell, you can see in this kinda list down\nthere that I have flyers and business\n\n124\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.300\ncards under Illustrator, but I also have\nflyers and business cards under InDesign.\n\n125\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.870\nSo, this is kinda the age old, well,\nwhich one do I use when I'm doing that?\n\n126\n00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.210\nI've actually used both, but it really\njust depends on what you need out of that\n\n127\n00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.290\nparticular publication\nthat you're creating.\n\n128\n00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.370\nAnd this could be either for print or web.\n\n129\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.330\nIt's just like, which one am I designing?\n\n130\n00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.970\nAnd so you can see that here we have\nIllustrator is really great for\n\n131\n00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.990\nsingle page layout.\n\n132\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.500\nYou don't really do multi-page\nlayouts within Illustrator.\n\n133\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.290\nIt just doesn't work that way.\n\n134\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.890\nIt doesn't have those capabilities.\n\n135\n00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.420\nInDesign is definitely for\nmulti-page layouts.\n\n136\n00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.350\nYou wanna do a four page brochure?\n\n137\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.570\nGo with InDesign.\n\n138\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.100\nIf you're talking about a single page,\nit's really depending on what you need.\n\n139\n00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.340\nIf you're going for lots of text,\nvery text heavy documents,\n\n140\n00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.420\nI would lean towards InDesign because\nInDesign has a lot more capabilities with\n\n141\n00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.140\nhow you can style text with style.\n\n142\n00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.040\nIllustrator has styles but\nit just doesn't work as well.\n\n143\n00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.000\nAnd I would not create a logo in InDesign.\n\n144\n00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.570\nI would create it in Illustrator because\nIllustrator has a lot more what I call\n\n145\n00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.070\ncrayons.\n\n146\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.120\nIt's got a lot more things\nthat you can play around with.\n\n147\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.690\nAnd it's just got really great stuff.\n\n148\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.190\nInDesign, page layout, text heavy.\n\n149\n00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:33.105\nIllustrator, more creative, more crayons,\nmore things you can do with it.\n\n150\n00:08:33.105 --> 00:08:38.570\nAnother factor that would always determine\nto me whether I would use InDesign\n\n151\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.160\nversus Illustrator was\nthe package function.\n\n152\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.080\nNow that's kind of old school now,\nbecause package is actually\n\n153\n00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.800\nin Illustrator starting in version CC6 and\nabove, like, what is package?\n\n154\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.070\nWhen you think of a package,\nwhat do you think about?\n\n155\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.060\nWhat's a package?\n\n156\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.090\n>> A Christmas present.\n\n157\n00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.230\n>> A Christmas present, right?\n\n158\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.430\nSo, you have all the goodies\ninside the present and\n\n159\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.940\nyou can take it around and move it.\n\n160\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.730\nThat's exactly what package\nmeans within these two products\n\n161\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.030\nbecause if you think about a flyer,\nyou're going to have some pictures,\n\n162\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.230\nyou're going to have some logos,\nyou're going to have some text.\n\n163\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.930\nSo you're going to be using files\nfrom other places if you wanna say\n\n164\n00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.610\nwithin your computer and so,\nif you're ready to transport that.\n\n165\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.040\nLet's say send it to a printer or\n\n166\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.790\nI'm sending it to you because you're\ngoing to take over editing my brochure or\n\n167\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.240\nsomething like that, you need everything\nthat comes along with that publication.\n\n168\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.900\nAnd I might have put it on one hard drive,\nand one folder here, one folder there.\n\n169\n00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.970\nPackage basically packages it all together\nin a nice little package, in a folder.\n\n170\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.040\nAnd that way that folder\nbecomes the single unit\n\n171\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.390\nof all of the elements that I need for\nthat design.\n\n172\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.020\nSo it's really great.\n\n173\n00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.260\n>> Makes it portable almost.\n\n174\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.190\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n175\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.380\nAnd so that was a huge determination for\n\n176\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.940\nme of which product that I\nwas used back in the day.\n\n177\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.738\nNow you got it in Illustrator and\nit's super great.\n\n178\n00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:05.784\nAll right,\nwhat do I have on my next slide?\n\n179\n00:10:05.784 --> 00:10:06.730\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n180\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.688\n>> I actually forgot what I was\n\n181\n00:10:07.688 --> 00:10:08.192\ndoing there.\n\n182\n00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:13.070\nAll right, so another important thing\nto know about when you're working\n\n183\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.870\nwith Illustrator is what version of\nIllustrator, well, do you have for\n\n184\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.797\none thing, and how that relates to others.\n\n185\n00:10:20.797 --> 00:10:25.460\nIf I have Adobe CC and you have Adobe Cs5.\n\n186\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.540\nI create this awesome logo and\nyou're like can you send me that logo,\n\n187\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.020\nbecause I wanna put it in our magazine or\nsomething like that.\n\n188\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.606\nSo I send it to you,\nyou won't be able to open it.\n\n189\n00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:41.283\nSo old does not open new, okay, but\n\n190\n00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:46.431\nnew can open old like if you\nsent me the logo that you\n\n191\n00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:51.231\ncreated in CS5, me in CS6, no what I'm in?\n\n192\n00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:52.200\nCS, CC.\n>> Creative Cloud?\n\n193\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.470\n>> That's what we're in.\n\n194\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.300\nIf I'm in CC I can open that file format.\n\n195\n00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.913\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay so\n\n196\n00:10:56.913 --> 00:11:00.991\nit is something that you always need\nto be aware of as a designer or\n\n197\n00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:05.085\nin creating anything in Illustrator\nis who else needs to use it.\n\n198\n00:11:05.085 --> 00:11:10.240\nSo it's always also better to stay\nin the native version that you have.\n\n199\n00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.000\nSo, if you create the logo in CC,\n\n200\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.910\nyou should keep editing it in CC,\nif at all possible.\n\n201\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.520\nThe reason I say that is because,\nwhen you go down\n\n202\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.150\nto lower versions of Illustrator,\nyou can lose some functionality, because,\n\n203\n00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.652\nof course, the evolution of the product,\nthey've added a lot more crayons.\n\n204\n00:11:29.652 --> 00:11:32.450\nThey've added a lot more tools,\na lot more functionality.\n\n205\n00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.610\nAnd so those newer versions support\nall these great new things.\n\n206\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.810\nThe older versions don't\nsupport all of that.\n\n207\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:44.601\nSo you could lose some of that formatting,\nI guess you could say, and even more than\n\n208\n00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:50.595\nthat, you wouldn't be able to edit those\nthings in an older version of Illustrator.\n\n209\n00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:54.543\nBut one thing I can do in\nnewer versions of Illustrator,\n\n210\n00:11:54.543 --> 00:12:00.110\nsuch as Adobe Illustrator CC, is I can\nsave down in compatibility for you.\n\n211\n00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.390\n>> So if you knew somebody had\nan older version of the program,\n\n212\n00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.510\nyou could save it as an older version\nthat they could then work with and edit.\n\n213\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.020\n>> Correct, yeah I was,\nI would actually take and do a Save As and\n\n214\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.150\nsave it as an Illustrator CS,\nwhat do we say you're on five?\n\n215\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.435\n>> Five.\n>> You're on five, okay so\n\n216\n00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.230\nI would save it as an Illustrator 5.\n\n217\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.710\nIt's still gonna show up\nto you as an AI file.\n\n218\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.380\nI see it as an AI file,\nyou see it as an AI file.\n\n219\n00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.740\nSo the file format doesn't change.\n\n220\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.590\nIt's just the compatibility\nof who can actually open it.\n\n221\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:30.850\nIt's not like the DOC,\n\n222\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.850\nDOCX thing that you have in-\n>> Like Office.\n\n223\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:33.570\n>> In Office.\n>> Yeah.\n\n224\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.050\n>> That was like a long time ago,\nwasn't it?\n\n225\n00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:35.610\nOkay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.440\nWell that's where I'm pulling from, so.\n\n227\n00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.630\nSo yeah, so you can see that as I haven't\ntoo far, you might lose some features.\n\n228\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.220\nAnd the different versions\nI have over there on the,\n\n229\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.640\ncan we pop that slide there for a second.\n\n230\n00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.420\nThere we go.\nI just have some different versions\n\n231\n00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.600\ndown here.\n\n232\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.120\nWe're in CC it goes all the way down to CS\nand then is actually starts the numbers.\n\n233\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:57.880\nSo then it goes 10 to.\n\n234\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.110\n>> Way back when.\n\n235\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.974\n>> Yeah and do you know that I have\na little note here that illustrator 1.0\n\n236\n00:13:03.974 --> 00:13:05.822\nwas realized in 1987.\n\n237\n00:13:05.822 --> 00:13:06.634\n>> Really?\n\n238\n00:13:06.634 --> 00:13:08.095\nWow.\n>> Yes.\n\n239\n00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:09.625\nLet's not talk about\nwhere we were in 1987.\n\n240\n00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:10.134\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:13:10.134 --> 00:13:12.530\n>> So we'll just go with that,\n\n242\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.810\nso all right.\n\n243\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.560\nSo let's move on to Tips and Tricks.\n\n244\n00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.430\nThis is just me trying to give you\na little bit of insight that I have\n\n245\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.160\nfound from teaching this product for\nover ten years,\n\n246\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.249\nusing the product for over ten years.\n\n247\n00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.520\nIt's all about your mouse cursor icon.\n\n248\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:36.310\nYou got to watch that little guy wherever\nit's going on your screen, whatever you're\n\n249\n00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:42.150\ndoing in Illustrator, that's the key to\nwhat's gonna happen when you click, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.070\nPeople get in and start clicking\nall over the place and are like,\n\n251\n00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:44.590\nwhy didn't it work,\n\n252\n00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.830\nwhy didn't it work and I'm like well\nwhat did the mouse cursor look like?\n\n253\n00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.840\nI don't know.\n\n254\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.040\nThat's gonna be your tried tale true,\nhow do we say that?\n\n255\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.860\n>> Tried and true?\n\n256\n00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.820\n>> Yes, tried and\ntrue method of what's gonna happen.\n\n257\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.850\nSo always watch your mouse cursor icon.\n\n258\n00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.280\nNext thing, single click versus double\nclick, they do different things.\n\n259\n00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.185\nSo if you get all click happy,\n\n260\n00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:08.616\nyou'll get to some places where you\nmight not know how you got there.\n\n261\n00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:10.282\nSo, but we'll explain all of these and\n\n262\n00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:13.362\nI'll show you all these different pit\nfalls to know how you can kinda back\n\n263\n00:14:13.362 --> 00:14:16.010\nyourself out of a corner when\nyou double click too many times.\n\n264\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.742\nMy biggest key, learn your shortcuts,\nkey, did you get that?\n\n265\n00:14:20.742 --> 00:14:23.574\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Learn your keyboard shortcuts,\n\n266\n00:14:23.574 --> 00:14:28.070\nit'll make you an extremely\nefficient user of Illustrator.\n\n267\n00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.350\nI didn't start out with\nkeyboard shortcuts.\n\n268\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.670\nI had to evolve to it.\n\n269\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:37.065\nBut now that I do that like\nall the time I can't go back.\n\n270\n00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:38.950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And I think you've actually,\n\n271\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.781\nyou've watched me.\n\n272\n00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:42.650\n[LAUGH]\n>> I have watched you make some documents\n\n273\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.762\nin here and it's the most\namazing thing you've ever seen.\n\n274\n00:14:45.762 --> 00:14:46.768\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One hand on the keyboard,\n\n275\n00:14:46.768 --> 00:14:47.385\none hand on the mouse.\n\n276\n00:14:47.385 --> 00:14:49.690\nAnd things are flying all over the screen.\n\n277\n00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.810\nBut without those keyboard shortcuts\nyou wouldn't be able to do that.\n\n278\n00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.470\n>> Yeah.\n\n279\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.970\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n280\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:54.770\n>> So very impressive.\n\n281\n00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.313\n>> And it makes you look like you\n\n282\n00:14:56.313 --> 00:15:01.003\nknow what you're doing [LAUGH].\nNo, it just makes you look like a master\n\n283\n00:15:01.003 --> 00:15:05.670\nbehind the keyboard, it's just [SOUND].\nSo learn your shortcuts.\n\n284\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.610\nThere are tons of resources out there.\n\n285\n00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.610\nSo they're everywhere.\n\n286\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.040\nThe Internet is filled with them and\nlots of great tips and tricks.\n\n287\n00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.840\nAlways keep learning.\n\n288\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.150\nThis product always evolves.\n\n289\n00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.840\nYou can never learn\neverything about Illustrator,\n\n290\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.980\nI just learned something like a couple\nmonths ago, I was like are you serious?\n\n291\n00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.940\nAnd it was like the smallest little thing,\n\n292\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.640\nI don't remember what it is right now, but\nit was like the tiniest little thing that\n\n293\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.499\nwas just like-\n>> Could have saved you some time\n\n294\n00:15:30.499 --> 00:15:31.106\nand, yeah.\n\n295\n00:15:31.106 --> 00:15:33.825\n>> Yeah, and\nwe were just talking about that today,\n\n296\n00:15:33.825 --> 00:15:38.110\nsomething in the select menu which\nwe'll go over in another episode.\n\n297\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.620\nThat I didn't learn for years, years.\n\n298\n00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.660\nAnd I was like why didn't I do this?\n\n299\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.195\nSo I'll show you all that.\n\n300\n00:15:44.195 --> 00:15:45.050\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.130\n>> The other thing,\n\n302\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.060\neverybody does it different.\n\n303\n00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.890\nI use Illustrator a certain way.\n\n304\n00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.900\nYou, well I'm not sure if\nyou use Illustrator [LAUGH],\n\n305\n00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.260\nbut you would use it a different way.\n\n306\n00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.040\nI use it for both print and web.\n\n307\n00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.031\nSome people use it just for\nprinting or just for t-shirt design.\n\n308\n00:16:01.031 --> 00:16:04.934\nSo whatever way you use Illustrator\nis the way that you know it and so\n\n309\n00:16:04.934 --> 00:16:10.027\nit's funny when you start talking to other\npeople that know Illustrator really well,\n\n310\n00:16:10.027 --> 00:16:13.395\nand they'll like I never do\nit that way I do it this way.\n\n311\n00:16:13.395 --> 00:16:16.235\nI'm like I didn't even know\nyou could do it that way, so\n\n312\n00:16:16.235 --> 00:16:19.840\nit's like you can get to the same\nend result so many different ways.\n\n313\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.310\nAnd just keep that in mind, that it's\nnot a one size fits all type of product.\n\n314\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.190\nJust like any of these Adobe products,\nreally.\n\n315\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.360\nI mean Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator,\n\n316\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.320\nit's all everybody's own bag,\nif you want to say it.\n\n317\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.480\nI know my stuff,\nif somebody came behind me,\n\n318\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.280\nthey'd be like,\nwhy did they do it that way?\n\n319\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.410\nThat's just the way I do it, so\njust kinda keep that in mind.\n\n320\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:47.000\nAnd [COUGH] PDF files,\nwe mentioned that a couple times.\n\n321\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:53.650\nYou can do some amazing things by\nopening PDFs in Illustrator, but\n\n322\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.290\nit all depends on where it came from.\n\n323\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.310\nIf it is a PDF created from Word,\n\n324\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.110\nyou're not gonna be able to do too much\nwith it opening up in Illustrator.\n\n325\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.290\nIf it was created from another Adobe\nproduct, to be created into a PDF,\n\n326\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.140\nthere's some really cool\nthings you can do with it,\n\n327\n00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.490\nthings that you would never think that,\nI need to get that out of that file.\n\n328\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.366\nIf you open up in Illustrator,\nyou'd be surprised what you can do.\n\n329\n00:17:16.366 --> 00:17:19.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it will, just a little point.\n\n330\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.190\nIt creates a ton of clipping masks,\n\n331\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.320\nyou probably don't know what that is\nright now, but it's just clipping mask\n\n332\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:30.255\nheaven when you get into some PDFs\nwhen you open up with Illustrator.\n\n333\n00:17:30.255 --> 00:17:36.479\nYou drill down enough in there,\nyou can get a lot of stuff out of the PDF.\n\n334\n00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:39.000\n>> Wow, can't wait to see it.\n\n335\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.693\nVonne thanks for that information, a great\nlook or overview of what we can expect\n\n336\n00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:48.110\nwith Adobe Illustrator in the upcoming\nepisodes that we've got lined up for\n\n337\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.020\nyou out there.\n\n338\n00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.675\nSo I hope everybody out there\nis as excited as I am and\n\n339\n00:17:51.675 --> 00:17:53.390\nVonne is to continue on.\n\n340\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.560\nLook forward to seeing you back for\nfuture episodes.\n\n341\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.950\nFor now, signing off.\n\n342\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.350\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n343\n00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.120\n>> I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n344\n00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.230\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n345\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.986\n>> Bye.\n\n346\n00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:07.460\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.370\nI'm your host,\n\n4\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.090\nMike Rodrick, today we're gonna be going\nover Adobe Illustrator Creative Cloud.\n\n5\n00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.120\nAnd specifically in this episode,\ngonna be focusing on the user interface,\n\n6\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.850\ngetting the program launched and\nlearning our way around so\n\n7\n00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.230\nthat we can be efficient\nworkers with Adobe Illustrator.\n\n8\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.620\nAnd here to help guide us through\nthat is Ms. Vaughn Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.740\nHow's it going Vaughn?\n\n10\n00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.110\n>> Hello, I'm here to, like Mike said,\n\n11\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.730\nI'm here to take you\nthrough Adobe Illustrator.\n\n12\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.590\nWe're gonna go through the environment so\n\n13\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.630\nwe can get comfortable with all\nthe basics of what we're looking at.\n\n14\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.030\nWhat are our tools,\nwhat are our workspace, preferences,\n\n15\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.910\nthings like that so we can start creating\nsome super awesome vector graphics.\n\n16\n00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.640\n>> I like it.\n>> So I guess we should start by opening\n\n17\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.530\nup Illustrator.\n\n18\n00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.150\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nget that fired up.\n\n19\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.100\nAnd it's probably going to take just\na little bit for it to start up because\n\n20\n00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.660\nthe good old Mac is a little old so-\n>> Little tired but still kicking it.\n\n21\n00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.500\n>> Yeah, got a new hard drive in,\n\n22\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.690\nit working like a charm\n>> Beautiful.\n\n23\n00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.420\n>> All right so\nwhen we start up Illustrator CC,\n\n24\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.710\nit's always going to default to\nstarting at your start screen.\n\n25\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.120\nI don't really have much\ngoing on on here because I,\n\n26\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.800\nactually right before this episode,\nI cleared all my preferences.\n\n27\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.750\nI wanted to start clean so you could\nsee it almost like a fresh install.\n\n28\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.520\n>> Cuz this is your everyday computer that\nyou've used and you've already done a lot\n\n29\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.730\nof customizations to the interface and\nthings like that?\n\n30\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.280\n>> Correct, yeah.\n\n31\n00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.368\n>> So we'll have to reset all that.\n\n32\n00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:42.470\n>> [CROSSTALK] I was\ndoing some practicing.\n\n33\n00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.976\nMake sure I have everything ready to\ngo to show y'all the great things about\n\n34\n00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:47.110\nIllustrator.\n\n35\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.220\nSo I wanted to reset it.\n\n36\n00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.610\nAnd if you're curious of\nhow you actually do that,\n\n37\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.470\nbefore you open Illustrator,\nif you hold down, what is it?\n\n38\n00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.740\nCommand, Option, Ctrl, Shift.\n\n39\n00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.240\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah.\n\n40\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.950\n>> Now that's a keyboard\n\n41\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.630\nshortcut.\n[LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.390\n>> Exactly,\n\n43\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.810\nand, of course, any time I say Command,\nthat really is Ctrl.\n\n44\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.610\nSo you might have to look up\nthe exact Window shortcut.\n\n45\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.750\nI might have thrown in an extra\nkey in there actually.\n\n46\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.690\nBut I held down a punch of keys, and\n\n47\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.700\nit reset all my preferences so\nI could show you it as it kind of starts.\n\n48\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.850\nSo anyways, that's what I did.\n\n49\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.080\nWe should probably look up the exact\n[LAUGH] Key combinations somewhere.\n\n50\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.340\n>> We'll put that in the notes for\nyou guys.\n\n51\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.030\n>> It worked in there.\n\n52\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.200\nSo, here's the start screen.\n\n53\n00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.195\nI don't really like the start screen.\n\n54\n00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:36.530\n[LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n55\n00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.830\nMaybe I'm old school, we never had a start\nscreen in older versions of Illustrator,\n\n56\n00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.118\nso it's just to me,\njust not how I roll with it, really.\n\n57\n00:02:46.118 --> 00:02:51.519\n[LAUGH] So it's up to you,\nI mean I can see the benefits of it, 100%.\n\n58\n00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.370\nIt's just how I go with it.\n\n59\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.610\n>> What kinda things do they have\non the start screen that we can-\n\n60\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.755\n>> It can show you the most recent\n\n61\n00:02:56.755 --> 00:02:58.535\nitems like all the different files, so\n\n62\n00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:03.725\nif you are doing a lot of different files\nwithin a project it's all right there.\n\n63\n00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:07.905\nYou can also check, I have one single\nfile going on, you can do some previews.\n\n64\n00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:09.192\n>> Nice.\n>> And so you can change the,\n\n65\n00:03:09.192 --> 00:03:10.992\nlist view versus the icon view.\n\n66\n00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:13.497\nSo it's almost like your file browser.\n\n67\n00:03:13.497 --> 00:03:14.582\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay so\n\n68\n00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:17.492\nmaybe it's just that I need to\nget used to it a little bit more.\n\n69\n00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:22.352\n[LAUGH] But I just wanted to give you that\noption if you don't want the start screen,\n\n70\n00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:24.082\nyou can change the preferences.\n\n71\n00:03:24.082 --> 00:03:28.222\nAnd it's actually right here on the start\nscreen in the upper right hand corner.\n\n72\n00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:31.040\nThere is the little wheel guy up here.\n\n73\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.370\nTo where it actually\nkinda gives you like hey,\n\n74\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.520\nif you don't wanna see this start menu-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n75\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.400\n>> When you start, you can go into\nyour preferences and change it.\n\n76\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.750\n>> Okay, so just kinda gives you a little\nheads up that that's what you want to do.\n\n77\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.710\nSo, and let's talk about\nthe preferences for a brief moment.\n\n78\n00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.470\nIf you're on a Mac, you're preferences\n\n79\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.842\nare always going to be in your Illustrator\nmenu, so illustrator preferences.\n\n80\n00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:01.500\nIf you're on a Windows machine, your\npreferences are always in your edit menu.\n\n81\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.970\nSo it's always done on the bottom, so\nedit preferences goes to that same thing.\n\n82\n00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.380\nSo you can see that right here from\nmy Illustrator preferences and\n\n83\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.220\nif I go in general,\nyou can see right there.\n\n84\n00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.610\nThat is the show start workspace\nwhen no documents are open.\n\n85\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.680\nSo that's the checkbox that's on by\ndefault, so you can turn them off.\n\n86\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.910\n>> Nice.\n>> And just an overview about preferences.\n\n87\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.020\nIt's exactly what it sounds like,\n\n88\n00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.840\nit's the preferences of your program,\nand there's a lot of things in here.\n\n89\n00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.710\nI mean, half of them, honestly,\nI probably don't even know what they do.\n\n90\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.250\nBut, it's things that we'll probably be\ngoing through as we go through episodes.\n\n91\n00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.250\nI'll pull up, hey, this is a really good\npoint to point out, this preference,\n\n92\n00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.240\neither turn it on or turn it off.\n\n93\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.600\nBut you can see over here\non the left hand side,\n\n94\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.540\nit has all the different topics,\nthe units, and the guides.\n\n95\n00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.870\nGreat, one thing I would like to\npoint out right from the start,\n\n96\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.850\nis the user interface.\n\n97\n00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.640\nYou see right now everything\nis very medium dark.\n\n98\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.040\nThis is a newer feature that they started\ndoing in some of the CC products, or\n\n99\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.550\nmaybe even CS 6, where you can actually\nchange the background color for\n\n100\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.090\nyou overall look of what\nyou've got going on.\n\n101\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.100\nSo you can see if I make it lighter,\neverything turns light, or\n\n102\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.710\nyou can go with a darker view.\n\n103\n00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.250\n>> Nice.\n\n104\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.080\n>> Yeah, so it's that kind of contrast,\nwhether you want white on dark, or\n\n105\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.825\ndark on white.\n\n106\n00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:24.550\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n107\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.070\n>> It really is a personal preference I\ntend to like it a little bit lighter for\n\n108\n00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.190\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n109\n00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.710\nBut see, it's got that kind of,\nright at 50, it goes,\n\n110\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.360\nlike ooh, way too much and way too dark.\n\n111\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.070\nSo I try to keep it on the lighter-ish\ngray side, if that's a color.\n\n112\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.610\n>> I think so.\n\n113\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.150\n>> Yeah, so we'll go with that.\n\n114\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.310\n[LAUGH] So I just kind of wanted to point\nthat out for you before we get started.\n\n115\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.980\n>> That can be very handy, I know a lot\nof times if I'm working in a low-light\n\n116\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.920\nenvironments, I don't want that white\nbackground because it almost makes you\n\n117\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.140\nsnow blind and\nreally it becomes very strenuous.\n\n118\n00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.950\nYour eyes start hurting, you get\na headache from staring at the screen, so\n\n119\n00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.685\nnice that I can darken that up if I need\nto, or brighten that up if I need to.\n\n120\n00:06:03.685 --> 00:06:07.265\n>> Yeah, like your auto brightness\npreferences and everything?\n\n121\n00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:07.955\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n122\n00:06:07.955 --> 00:06:09.185\n>> So that's that.\n\n123\n00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:13.455\nI'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to turn off,\n\n124\n00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:16.575\nI just told you where that preference\nis and I actually didn't turn it off.\n\n125\n00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:19.415\nI'm going to uncheck that Show Start\nWorkspace when No Documents are Open\n\n126\n00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:22.165\nbecause I would like to\nexplore that interface\n\n127\n00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:25.070\nwith you without having a file open.\n\n128\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.070\nSo that's why I'm going to turn that off,\nto show you,\n\n129\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.460\nhere we go, here is Illustrator.\n\n130\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.060\nAll right, so what you're looking at\nright now is considered the work space.\n\n131\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.120\nThat's what all of your Adobe products\nrefer to your work environment.\n\n132\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.110\nThe things we're gonna go over right\nnow are actually the same in Photoshop,\n\n133\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.310\nInDesign, all of your Adobe products.\n\n134\n00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.990\nSo if you've seen this or you've\ngone over workspaces in one product,\n\n135\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.130\nyou've kind of gone over in all of them.\n\n136\n00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:58.340\nSo this is like a multifaceted\na multiplatform type of tutorial.\n\n137\n00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:04.300\nSo you've got over here on the right-hand\nside, what are called panels.\n\n138\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.900\nWhen you start with them\nthey're in just a single strip\n\n139\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.570\nwith the little icons right there.\n\n140\n00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.460\nWhat are they?\n\n141\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.920\nI don't know what this little\nwheelie thing looks like.\n\n142\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.930\nWell, if you hover to discover,\n\n143\n00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.950\nyou can get a little tool tip that lets\nyou know exactly what that panel is.\n\n144\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.600\nAnd if you single click it, it will,\nas I call pull it out of the drawer.\n\n145\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.300\nIt pulls that panel out of that little\ndrawer, you see what that is, and\n\n146\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.270\nthere's the color, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.470\nIt's not gonna show you any of\nthe options within the color right now,\n\n148\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.020\nbecause we don't have any document open,\nso it's not gonna show you everything.\n\n149\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.250\nIf I want to push the drawer back in,\nyou click the little button once, and\n\n150\n00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.740\nit pushes the drawer back in.\n\n151\n00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.669\nSo pull out, push it back in,\nthat's great.\n\n152\n00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:49.332\nAnd so all of these icons, if you like\nthat area of where you're actually\n\n153\n00:07:49.332 --> 00:07:53.919\nworking to be maximized as much as\npossible, then you can go ahead and,\n\n154\n00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:56.071\nyou can keep it in this icon mode.\n\n155\n00:07:56.071 --> 00:07:59.046\nAnd just pull the drawers out when\nyou want it, and push them back in.\n\n156\n00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:03.864\nThat's fine, I’ve memorized these\nicons and I use them in that way.\n\n157\n00:08:03.864 --> 00:08:08.523\nBut sometimes when I'm working on products\nor working on designs I wanna see all of\n\n158\n00:08:08.523 --> 00:08:09.324\nthe panels-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n159\n00:08:09.324 --> 00:08:11.570\n>> I kinda just gonna click through them.\n\n160\n00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.750\nAnd this also goes back to the way\nthey used to have panels organized in\n\n161\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.720\nsome of the older products of illustrator.\n\n162\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.420\nIs that they are in what's\nknown as expanded view.\n\n163\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.420\nSo that little tiny\ntriangle guy right there.\n\n164\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.820\nThe the two triangles right there.\n\n165\n00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.220\nThat is your expand panels button.\n\n166\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.510\nSo if you single click on that it just\ngoes ahead and pulls them all out.\n\n167\n00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:35.302\nAnd they become in this kind of stacked,\ntabbed format.\n\n168\n00:08:35.302 --> 00:08:39.330\nAnd each of these panels are in\nwhat are called panel groups.\n\n169\n00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.760\nSo the swatches, the brushes and\nthe symbols are all in one group.\n\n170\n00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.769\nAnd then the color, the color guides and\nthe color themes are in another group.\n\n171\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.940\nThese panels can be completely customized.\n\n172\n00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:58.630\nYou can move them, you can hide them,\nyou can change them, anything you want.\n\n173\n00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.590\n>> So if you get some you use more often\nthan others you want to make those\n\n174\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.620\nmaybe up towards the top or\na little more accessible.\n\n175\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.440\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n176\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.330\nOr if maybe there's some that you\njust never use, or like I'm not using\n\n177\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.190\nThis particular panel and this product,\nor this project, you can close them.\n\n178\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.790\nBut then what if you're\nworking on another project and\n\n179\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.800\nyou do use that panel from time to time.\n\n180\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.550\nAll of this stuff that we're working on,\nthe panels, and\n\n181\n00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.320\nthen when we go over to the left hand\nside and we talk about the tools.\n\n182\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.410\nThese are in predefined work space, okay.\n\n183\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.410\nSo up here at the top, you can see there's\nsomething called, it says essentials.\n\n184\n00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.720\nOkay, that's just the name\nof this particular workspace\n\n185\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.550\nthat always is on by default\nwhen you start Illustrator.\n\n186\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.380\nIt's the Essentials workspace.\n\n187\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.260\nAnd that just means that\nthe type of panels that are open,\n\n188\n00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.540\nhow they're Arranged.\n\n189\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.740\nAre the expanded or not expanded?\n\n190\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.650\nThat type of stuff.\n\n191\n00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.480\nSo, this is the essentials.\n\n192\n00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.890\nAnd if you click on that,\nthere's some other drop-downs and\n\n193\n00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.570\nthere's a drop-down that has\nother pre-determined workspaces.\n\n194\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.880\nSuch as the layout workspace and\n\n195\n00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.870\nyou see how this one,\nyou've got some expanded panels over here.\n\n196\n00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.800\nBut then you also have\na whole other docked\n\n197\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.110\nStation here that has all\nthe panels in icon mode.\n\n198\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.900\nSo you get a whole bunch of them in there.\n\n199\n00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.570\nAnd then if you go over to tracing,\nwhich we'll talk when we do image tracing,\n\n200\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:24.460\ndifferent panels, typography, when we're\nworking a lot with text, you're gonna have\n\n201\n00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.490\npanels such as the character, the open\ntype panel styles, things like that.\n\n202\n00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.440\nSo lots of different\nconfigurations of panels\n\n203\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.460\nthat are predetermined by Illustrator.\n\n204\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.090\nAnd you can switch through\nthem however you want.\n\n205\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.030\nSo let's go back to\nthe essentials just for fun.\n\n206\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.210\nBecause I had already expanded this out.\n\n207\n00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.460\nLet's just play around with this.\n\n208\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.730\nNow, are you going to do this every\ntime that you work with Illustrator?\n\n209\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:53.020\nIt all depends on how you want\nto Set up your environment,\n\n210\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.600\nthat these panels that\nare now in expanded mode,\n\n211\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.470\nyou can pull them out and\nundock them from this docking station.\n\n212\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.560\nSo I can grab this color panel and if I\nclick hold and drag, just drag it out.\n\n213\n00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.290\nYou can see I can drag it out from that\ndocking station and put it out over here.\n\n214\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.980\nmaybe then I want to drag out the gradient\npanel and drag out the art boards, and\n\n215\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.610\nso you can see that each one of them can\nbe independent from the docking station.\n\n216\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:24.300\nI can then collapse this down, I mean\nthe possibilities are honestly endless.\n\n217\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.660\nI mean, however you want to do it.\n\n218\n00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.180\nI'm just giving you some\nideas of what you can do.\n\n219\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:37.500\nNow when they're out in the wild,\nyou can then organise each panel\n\n220\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.930\ndifferently out here, if you want, you can\ngroup it, you can pull this art board.\n\n221\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.970\nNow the thing you've got to watch for\n\n222\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.460\nwhen you start moving all this\nstuff round- you've got to look for\n\n223\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.630\nthe little blue lines.\n\n224\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.650\nBecause if I go here,\nyou see that blue line right there?\n\n225\n00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.790\nThat's different than if\nI put it right there.\n\n226\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.840\nSee the blue line around the whole thing,\nversus the blue line around the bottom.\n\n227\n00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.060\nIf I put it here, I'm grouping it\nto become like a middle tabs, so\n\n228\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.480\nif I take this gradient over\nhere I can group that there, so\n\n229\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.410\nnow I have a group of\nthese three panels here.\n\n230\n00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.710\nIf I take this gradient and\npull it down there,\n\n231\n00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.870\nthere is a blue line there\nNow it becomes stacked.\n\n232\n00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.770\nIt's stacked on top.\n\n233\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.500\nThey're in a group but\nthey're stacked okay.\n\n234\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.710\n>> Nice.\n>> Keep on going right\n\n235\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.580\nendless possibilities around here.\n\n236\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.170\nA few little points do you see on this\none particular the gradient panel\n\n237\n00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.938\nit has two little.\n\n238\n00:12:31.938 --> 00:12:32.962\narrow-y things.\n\n239\n00:12:32.962 --> 00:12:34.330\n>> Chevron-y looking things.\n\n240\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.625\n>> Chevrons!\nThere we go.\n\n241\n00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:38.230\nArrow-y things,\nI tend to make up a lot of words.\n\n242\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:44.110\nSo we got arrow-y things and\nwhat this means here, and just to show you\n\n243\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:49.640\nthe difference in the colors themes, we\ndon't have any arrow-y things or Chevrons.\n\n244\n00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:57.570\nThat just lets you know that there are\noptions in this panel that can be shown or\n\n245\n00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.520\nHidden and almost had hide it [LAUGH] Now,\nwhat you could do here\n\n246\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.370\nis if you double click, single click\nversus double click different things.\n\n247\n00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.120\nHere, if I double click you see it kind of\ncollapses it and double click it again,\n\n248\n00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.260\nit collapses it again Double-click,\nall the way open.\n\n249\n00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.270\nSo it's like there's two steps,\ntwo stages if you want to say.\n\n250\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.760\nWith the color themes there's\nno little chevron thing.\n\n251\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.910\nSo if I double-click,\nall that's going to do is collapse.\n\n252\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:31.700\nSo double-clicking on any of your\nexpanded panels collapses them, and/ or\n\n253\n00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.920\nChanges it to the different steps that you\nhave within the options of each panel.\n\n254\n00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.430\nNow that's just me clicking around.\n\n255\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.900\nLike okay, double-click, single-click,\nokay, change all that down.\n\n256\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.935\nBut what if I didn't know about\nclicking them or whatever.\n\n257\n00:13:45.935 --> 00:13:50.630\nThere's this little guy over on the right\nhand side of any of your panels.\n\n258\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.275\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n259\n00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:53.960\n>> I call this the four lines and\na triangle button.\n\n260\n00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is gonna be the whole series so.\n\n261\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But that's-\n\n262\n00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.880\n>> Don't they call that the hamburger icon\n\n263\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.656\nI believe, yeah.\n\n264\n00:14:02.656 --> 00:14:03.540\n>> [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n265\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.115\n>> I do, I think.\n\n266\n00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:05.380\n[LAUGH]\n>> You're actually right.\n\n267\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.435\nAnd web design, when you have that\ncollapsible menu, and responsive design.\n\n268\n00:14:08.435 --> 00:14:09.610\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> You have that hamburger menu\n\n269\n00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.910\non the top, or on the right, or\nwherever the hamburger wants to be.\n\n270\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.435\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n271\n00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:14.580\n>> So, this\n\n272\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.723\nhamburger with some fries on the side?\n\n273\n00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:17.624\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n274\n00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:18.253\n>> A fry?\nUn fry?\n\n275\n00:14:18.253 --> 00:14:18.880\n[LAUGH].\n\n276\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.520\nThis is the Panel Options button.\n\n277\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.600\nSo you can see over on the side that\nthat Show Options, if I click it,\n\n278\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.910\nnow it becomes Hide Options.\n\n279\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.620\nOkay.\nSo, and see, notice,\n\n280\n00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:36.740\nsince there's a two stage in this\nparticular panel, when I Hid the options.\n\n281\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.310\nIt just did that one stage.\n\n282\n00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.160\nNow you've got the show and\nso you got that.\n\n283\n00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.940\nCause, that's just where it goes.\n\n284\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.290\nAnd all of the panels have them.\n\n285\n00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.450\nSo I can come over here to the swatches.\n\n286\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.300\nAnd even though it's docked I\ncan go into that four lines and\n\n287\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.530\na triangle button and I can pull up.\n\n288\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.100\nNow you're saying, wow there's\na lot more things going on here.\n\n289\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.730\n>> Yeah, because this panel has a lot\nmore options available than the gradient.\n\n290\n00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.980\nThe gradient just has the gradient.\n\n291\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.960\nThere's nothing else really going on\nin there except show and hide options.\n\n292\n00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.400\nThe swatches, you've got tons of\nstuff going on in the swatches.\n\n293\n00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.730\nYou can see lots of\ndifferent options here.\n\n294\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.830\nBut if I go to say the Stroke panel.\n\n295\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.550\n>> That just has show options\nin that contextual menu,\n\n296\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.440\nI think they call that, right?\n\n297\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.540\nOr drop down,\nwhatever we're calling that thing.\n\n298\n00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.322\nThe four lines.\n\n299\n00:15:24.322 --> 00:15:24.822\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n300\n00:15:24.822 --> 00:15:27.349\n[LAUGH] So you can see that every panel is\n\n301\n00:15:27.349 --> 00:15:29.710\ngoing to have something different.\n\n302\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:35.490\n>> In that panel options depending on\nthe functionality of that panel, okay.\n\n303\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.300\nAnd we can move them around and\ndo whatever we want.\n\n304\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.380\nYou can undock this entire\nthing that comes out here, and\n\n305\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.440\nthen you can expand it.\n\n306\n00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.230\nAnd you can do all this weird stuff, and\n\n307\n00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:49.073\nyou might be like okay I'm just,\nI've really messed this thing up.\n\n308\n00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.697\n[LAUGH] Can I just start over?\n\n309\n00:15:50.697 --> 00:15:53.436\nCan I go back to make it all pretty?\n\n310\n00:15:53.436 --> 00:15:54.669\nYes you can.\n\n311\n00:15:54.669 --> 00:15:57.117\nYou can reset your work space.\n\n312\n00:15:57.117 --> 00:15:58.681\nBecause if you close Illustrator,\n\n313\n00:15:58.681 --> 00:16:01.978\nI'm not going to close it cause it'll\ntake a while to get this baby back up.\n\n314\n00:16:01.978 --> 00:16:03.744\nBut if you close this and\n\n315\n00:16:03.744 --> 00:16:09.020\ncome back all of your last panel\nlocations are going to stay.\n\n316\n00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.910\nSo you can come back to here and you see,\nsince Essentials is the one I'm working,\n\n317\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.180\nyou can reset Essentials.\n\n318\n00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.230\nOr any of your predefined\nworkspaces that you started with.\n\n319\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.030\nIf I reset Essentials, you see\neverything gets tucked back nice and\n\n320\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.190\nneat on over to the side,\nand I'm good to go, yay.\n\n321\n00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:25.786\n>> Nice.\n>> And\n\n322\n00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:27.780\nI haven't messed up anything too bad,\nright?\n\n323\n00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.940\n>> Always good to have an exit strategy,\nright?\n\n324\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.540\nIt's fun to play around and\nkind of experiment and explore, but\n\n325\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.018\nyou get to point where\nnow I know what I want.\n\n326\n00:16:36.018 --> 00:16:38.771\nSo let me put everything back and\nI'll bring out just the ones I want and\n\n327\n00:16:38.771 --> 00:16:39.860\narrange them how I need it.\n\n328\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.990\n>> Yes put-\n>> So very handy.\n\n329\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.410\n>> Yeah, put your toys back.\n\n330\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.810\n>> Yes.\n>> Right, make mom happy.\n\n331\n00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.716\nAnd then you can pull them\nout when she leaves [LAUGH]\n\n332\n00:16:46.716 --> 00:16:47.491\n>> That's right\n\n333\n00:16:47.491 --> 00:16:48.254\n[LAUGH]\n>> A good thing.\n\n334\n00:16:48.254 --> 00:16:52.804\nSo I did kind of want to point out a few\nquick things here, is that you can see I\n\n335\n00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:57.010\nhave Test1 and Test1 with Tool,\ncuz I was doing some testing here.\n\n336\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.320\nYou can create your own workspaces,\nwhich is pretty awesome.\n\n337\n00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.500\nBecause I don't have exact,\nlike any of the predefined workspaces,\n\n338\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.522\nthey don't always give\nme exactly what I need.\n\n339\n00:17:07.522 --> 00:17:10.740\n>> Right, like features from one and\nsome features from the other and\n\n340\n00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.710\ncan we combine them.\n\n341\n00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.566\nAnd I guess you can,\nby making your own custom player.\n\n342\n00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:16.530\n>> Exactly, but I like a lot of\nthe things that Essential gives me.\n\n343\n00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.340\nAnd I do like to have it expanded,\nbut there is things that I am missing.\n\n344\n00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.530\nLike, I'm missing the Character panel.\n\n345\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.130\nI'm missing the Paragraph panel.\n\n346\n00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.240\nThere's the Pathfinder panel.\n\n347\n00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.120\nI use that all the time.\n\n348\n00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.050\nWhere are they?\n\n349\n00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.820\nLike, they're not in these presets.\n\n350\n00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.135\nSo, where do I go to find them?\n\n351\n00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:35.930\nIn all of your Adobe products,\nyou always go to your Window menu.\n\n352\n00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.915\nYour Window menu is where you can go and\n\n353\n00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:40.718\nfind every panel that you\ncould ever think of, okay.\n\n354\n00:17:40.718 --> 00:17:43.694\nSo that you're kind of, it's weird,\nbecause you say, you think View,\n\n355\n00:17:43.694 --> 00:17:45.340\nlike I want to see what I'm looking at.\n\n356\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.940\nIt's not, it's your Window, okay?\n\n357\n00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.758\nSo you can see here,\nthat I've got all sorts of things in here.\n\n358\n00:17:50.758 --> 00:17:53.990\nAnd because my resolution's down\na little low so you guys can see it,\n\n359\n00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.820\nI have to scroll through that,\nthere are a ton of panels in Illustrator.\n\n360\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.520\nSo you can see in the Type group,\nI have Character right there.\n\n361\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.320\nSo I can bring up this Character,\nwhich brings up these three.\n\n362\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.260\nI don't always need the open type.\n\n363\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.420\nI did ten I'll keep it there,\nwe'll keep it.\n\n364\n00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.240\nBut I want to,\nI don't want it free flowing.\n\n365\n00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.910\nSo I just pull it into here.\n\n366\n00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.790\nNow I can put it in with that same group.\n\n367\n00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.350\nRemember the blue lines where\nI can put it in between, so\n\n368\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.685\nI can kinda give it it's own little space.\n\n369\n00:18:19.685 --> 00:18:20.670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n370\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.400\n>> I can close out other things.\n\n371\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.988\nI mean,\nI actually use a lot of this stuff, so.\n\n372\n00:18:24.988 --> 00:18:28.210\n[LAUGH] Maybe we'll cut out the Libraries,\njust because.\n\n373\n00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.000\nAnd I can click on the Panel Options, and\n\n374\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.478\nI can delete the Library, or\nI can just pull this out here.\n\n375\n00:18:37.478 --> 00:18:39.032\nAnd I can then close that there,\n\n376\n00:18:39.032 --> 00:18:43.290\nthere's a whole bunch of ways that you can\nkind of take panels out and put them in.\n\n377\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:49.748\nSo maybe this is exactly how I\nwant to have my panels arranged.\n\n378\n00:18:49.748 --> 00:18:54.416\nI can come into here, and\nI can go to New Workspace.\n\n379\n00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:56.337\nAnd this does include your tools,\n\n380\n00:18:56.337 --> 00:19:00.458\nplacement stuff that we haven't gone\nto that side of the screen just yet.\n\n381\n00:19:00.458 --> 00:19:03.188\nBut we'll get there in a second,\nbut I wanted to point that out.\n\n382\n00:19:03.188 --> 00:19:08.168\nYou go to New Workspace and\nI can say Vaughan, right?\n\n383\n00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:09.148\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n384\n00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:14.058\n>> And now I have a workspace\nthat is part of the program.\n\n385\n00:19:14.058 --> 00:19:16.614\nClose it, come back three weeks later,\n\n386\n00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:20.988\nit's still gonna be in my list of\npreset workspaces from here on out.\n\n387\n00:19:20.988 --> 00:19:21.600\n>> Nice.\n\n388\n00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.218\n>> So I could switch to Essentials, okay.\n\n389\n00:19:24.218 --> 00:19:26.490\nWell, wait, why didn't it switch back?\n\n390\n00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.624\nWhy didn't that change?\n\n391\n00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:28.301\n>> I don't know.\n\n392\n00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:29.595\n>> [LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n393\n00:19:29.595 --> 00:19:30.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's because that's what\n\n394\n00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.570\nwe started with.\n\n395\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.635\nWe started with Essentials.\n\n396\n00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:33.220\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n397\n00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.980\n>> We customized it.\n\n398\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.700\n>> And it's still remembering all of\nthose like, on the fly customizations.\n\n399\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.630\n>> So\nwe need to reset Essentials at this point.\n\n400\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.430\n>> Bingo.\n\n401\n00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.340\nSo if I reset Essentials, that goes\nback to the way Essentials looks.\n\n402\n00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.536\nI go to mine, and then it goes\nback to the way that I like it.\n\n403\n00:19:49.536 --> 00:19:51.070\n>> Gotcha, very nice.\n\n404\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.060\n>> Yeah, it's great.\n\n405\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.789\nSo that's where if you have different\nprojects that you are working on that you\n\n406\n00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:59.307\nneed some panels for some things and\ncertain panels for the other things.\n\n407\n00:19:59.307 --> 00:20:01.690\nJust save them as workspaces and\nyou can do that.\n\n408\n00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.110\nSo I’ve done project specific workspaces,\n\n409\n00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:09.348\njust my specific workspaces\nthe way that I like things.\n\n410\n00:20:09.348 --> 00:20:13.390\nAnd that’s what you can do with\nyour workspaces in Illustrator, and\n\n411\n00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.310\nall of your Adobe products.\n\n412\n00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.076\n>> Nice.\n>> So, let's move over to tools.\n\n413\n00:20:17.076 --> 00:20:20.156\nLet's go to the left-hand\nside of the screen.\n\n414\n00:20:20.156 --> 00:20:21.914\nKind of the same stuff right here.\n\n415\n00:20:21.914 --> 00:20:24.890\nActually, I changed this before\nwe started this episode.\n\n416\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.770\nI'm almost positive that it starts\nas one single column when you start\n\n417\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.690\nIllustrator by default.\n\n418\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.860\nThe two little triangles there on\nthe left-hand side can take it into two\n\n419\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.770\ncolumns versus a single column.\n\n420\n00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.264\nAgain, I'm used to seeing\nmy tools in two columns, so\n\n421\n00:20:41.264 --> 00:20:46.220\nthat's just where I know where\ntools are in a two column layout.\n\n422\n00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.688\nI don't know where they are when\nthey're in single columns.\n\n423\n00:20:47.688 --> 00:20:48.698\n>> Yeah, you gotta hunt and find them.\n\n424\n00:20:48.698 --> 00:20:50.098\n>> Yeah, it's like muscle memory, right.\n\n425\n00:20:50.098 --> 00:20:51.830\nI just know where they are.\n\n426\n00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.620\nSo I like to keep them\nin the two column setup.\n\n427\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.640\nThere's some cool, new things\nthat you can do with your tools.\n\n428\n00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.420\nYou can actually make\nyour own toolbars now.\n\n429\n00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.887\nWhat they've done,\n\n430\n00:21:03.887 --> 00:21:08.868\nis they've like separated out the panels\nfrom the tools in a workspace.\n\n431\n00:21:08.868 --> 00:21:10.540\nIt was always one entity.\n\n432\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.800\nLike your workspace was the whole shebang.\n\n433\n00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.250\nNow you can separate your tools\nseparate from your panels and\n\n434\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.088\nput them in your workspaces.\n\n435\n00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:21.920\nThey're in your Window menu,\nand you go to Tools,\n\n436\n00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.010\nyou can see you can actually\nmake a New Tools Panel.\n\n437\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.250\nAnd it starts out,\nI'm just gonna go for it now.\n\n438\n00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.821\nSo let's just go Test2,\ncuz I might have a Test1 in there.\n\n439\n00:21:32.821 --> 00:21:39.178\n[LAUGH] So you can see that it's just\nkind of got the start of a tools panel.\n\n440\n00:21:39.178 --> 00:21:44.638\nAnd then what you can do is you can\njust drag and drop tools that you like,\n\n441\n00:21:44.638 --> 00:21:50.190\nlike maybe I only use the pen, the brush,\nthe seahorse tool as I call it.\n\n442\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:51.150\n[LAUGH] It's the width tool.\n\n443\n00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.750\nAnd maybe like the black arrow or\nsomething like that.\n\n444\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.660\nThose are the only tools I ever\nuse in Illustrator, like ever.\n\n445\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.630\nThat's your tool now.\n\n446\n00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:06.170\nSo you could take this guy and\nyou could close this guy out and\n\n447\n00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.230\nthen this is my tool.\n\n448\n00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.975\nAnd then that's all I need.\n\n449\n00:22:08.975 --> 00:22:13.120\nAnd if I wanted too I could switch\nback and go back to my default.\n\n450\n00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.870\nAnd then, my other guy is still there, and\nthen I can just bring back, I close them.\n\n451\n00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:18.730\nAnd I can bring them back.\n\n452\n00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.330\nSo it's like you can\ncustomize your toolbox.\n\n453\n00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.040\n>> Wow.\n>> Specifically to what you want.\n\n454\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.200\n>> So you can really customize this\ninterface to exactly what you need, and\n\n455\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.940\njust make it more efficient,\nand really easier and\n\n456\n00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.430\nalmost pleasurable to work with.\n\n457\n00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.670\nBecause you know where everything is,\nit's right where you want it.\n\n458\n00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.580\nYou're not stuck using somebody\nelse's idea of where stuff should be.\n\n459\n00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.940\n>> It's all about you.\n\n460\n00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.630\nAll about you and what you want.\n\n461\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.142\nAdobe will give it to you.\n\n462\n00:22:45.142 --> 00:22:48.292\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclose that little tools panel out.\n\n463\n00:22:48.292 --> 00:22:51.110\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust reset my tools.\n\n464\n00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.170\nActually I'm just gonna\ndock it back in here.\n\n465\n00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.530\nSo see, it's kind of got that,\nsee that little blue line?\n\n466\n00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.650\nThat lets me know that I've docked it.\n\n467\n00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.350\nBecause people will undock things and\nthey kind of freak out and\n\n468\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.250\nthey don't know what happened, so\njust know that you've got that.\n\n469\n00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.100\n>> Been there, done that.\n\n470\n00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.230\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n471\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.540\nAnd we'll go over all the tools and\ndetails as we go through these episodes,\n\n472\n00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.170\nso we don't need to go\nover every single name.\n\n473\n00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.170\nYou do have the hover to discover\non any of your tools here.\n\n474\n00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.990\nSo if I hover over,\nthis is the rectangle tool.\n\n475\n00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.040\nOne thing I would like to point out now,\nis that you see how,\n\n476\n00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.288\nI'm trying to get the little guy,\nthat's not gonna let me go.\n\n477\n00:23:22.288 --> 00:23:23.296\nI was trying to zoom in so\nyou guys could see it.\n\n478\n00:23:23.296 --> 00:23:28.289\nBut in the parentheses after every\ntool tip name that you get when you\n\n479\n00:23:28.289 --> 00:23:31.892\nhover to discover,\nin parentheses is a letter.\n\n480\n00:23:31.892 --> 00:23:34.092\nThat letter indicates the hotkey.\n\n481\n00:23:34.092 --> 00:23:39.458\nOkay, so the black arrow tool is the V,\njust straight up V.\n\n482\n00:23:39.458 --> 00:23:42.878\nAnd like the hand tool,\nwhat do you think the hand tool might be?\n\n483\n00:23:42.878 --> 00:23:43.458\n>> H.\n\n484\n00:23:43.458 --> 00:23:48.378\n>> Yes, if you click the h it's going to\nactually, now I tell you that and well,\n\n485\n00:23:48.378 --> 00:23:50.860\nwhy isn't it working?\n\n486\n00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.520\nWell anyways.\n\n487\n00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.401\nIt will work, so [LAUGH].\n\n488\n00:23:53.401 --> 00:23:57.016\nWhen you go ahead and do your hotkeys,\nbut for some reason mine's not,\n\n489\n00:23:57.016 --> 00:23:57.929\nwe'll fix that.\n\n490\n00:23:57.929 --> 00:23:59.064\nWe'll just click on it for now.\n\n491\n00:23:59.064 --> 00:23:59.977\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n492\n00:23:59.977 --> 00:24:01.091\n>> Whoops, that backfired.\n\n493\n00:24:01.091 --> 00:24:05.683\nAnyways, start recognizing them,\nstart learning those hot keys.\n\n494\n00:24:05.683 --> 00:24:09.071\nBecause that's another one of those things\nwhere you can switch to different tools by\n\n495\n00:24:09.071 --> 00:24:11.422\njust using your keyboard, and\nyou don't have to go over and\n\n496\n00:24:11.422 --> 00:24:12.850\nclick to get the tool that you need.\n\n497\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.460\nBut it is all about what tool\nis in my hand to be able My-\n\n498\n00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.020\n>> And we don't have a document open, so\n\n499\n00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.410\nit's probably not letting us\nswitch to some of those tools.\n\n500\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.296\n>> My gosh, I think you're right.\n\n501\n00:24:23.296 --> 00:24:24.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n502\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.635\n>> Hey, point for you!\n\n503\n00:24:25.635 --> 00:24:27.048\n>> [NOISE]\n>> Yay, good job.\n\n504\n00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:28.873\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Thank you.\n\n505\n00:24:28.873 --> 00:24:29.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> Awesome.\n\n506\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.920\nSo, that is the interface overall.\n\n507\n00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.925\nMaybe just a few little points and\nthen we'll wrap this up.\n\n508\n00:24:36.925 --> 00:24:37.770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n509\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.470\n>> One thing I, the tear off.\n\n510\n00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.650\nTear off right.\n\n511\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.990\nThis rectangle tool.\n\n512\n00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.520\nThis has multiple tools within it.\n\n513\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.350\nAs I call it under it.\n\n514\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:52.230\nYou know this because of the little\ntriangle that's on the bottom right hand\n\n515\n00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.955\ncorner of that tool, so\nthat let's you know that there's more.\n\n516\n00:24:55.955 --> 00:24:56.565\nSo if you click and\n\n517\n00:24:56.565 --> 00:25:00.795\nhold on your mouse it actually\nkind of flies out the other tools.\n\n518\n00:25:00.795 --> 00:25:03.575\nAnd this is very similar\nto all your products.\n\n519\n00:25:03.575 --> 00:25:07.305\nBut if I get there, okay that's great,\nso if I want to come down and\n\n520\n00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:08.095\nget the polygon tool.\n\n521\n00:25:08.095 --> 00:25:10.785\nBut now, what if I want to come back and\nget the circle tool.\n\n522\n00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:16.450\nGotta click and hold and I go there\nagain this little guy right at the end,\n\n523\n00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.940\nthat, that is called a tear off.\n\n524\n00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.690\nOkay, now I'm holding my mouse down as I'm\nhovering over this because if I hold my\n\n525\n00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.990\nmouse and let go over the tear off,\n\n526\n00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:30.910\nit actually tears off this little tool.\n\n527\n00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:37.620\nThis little tool box of those particular\nembedded or underneath or inside, tools.\n\n528\n00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.280\nLike if I go over here to the seahorse,\n\n529\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.710\nthere's a lot of,\nagain sorry, the width tool.\n\n530\n00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.650\nThe width tool actually has\na lot of cool tools in here so\n\n531\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.920\nif I could just tear this off,\nthen I can pull this up here.\n\n532\n00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.450\nYou know the pen tool, I use these all\nthe time when we talk about the pen, and\n\n533\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.270\nyou can actually see they kind\nof snap next to each other.\n\n534\n00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:02.140\nSo you can tear off these part of\nthe tools are these multiple tools and\n\n535\n00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.010\nhave them available for you there.\n\n536\n00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.660\n>> Nice.\n\n537\n00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:09.310\nSo then again, fully customizing\nthat interface to whatever you need.\n\n538\n00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.960\n>> Exactly.\n\n539\n00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.580\nSo.\nAll right.\n\n540\n00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.460\nSo it brought us a lot of information.\n\n541\n00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.340\nAgain, learning that interface.\n\n542\n00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.080\nAlways important with any program and\n\n543\n00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.070\nespecially with this because\nthere's a lot to it.\n\n544\n00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.510\nWe've got panels, we've got tools,\n\n545\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.750\nwe haven't even opened up\nour first document yet.\n\n546\n00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.230\nWe've got menus across the top.\n\n547\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.270\nSo thanks for that.\n\n548\n00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.420\nAppreciate all that information.\n\n549\n00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.000\nAnything else you want to throw in for\nthis episode?\n\n550\n00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.800\nI don't think so,\n\n551\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.980\nI think we've covered enough we'll\nprobably make a part two of this one too.\n\n552\n00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.050\n>> Okay, so we've got more to go.\n\n553\n00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:39.350\nAll right, well there you go ladies and\ngentleman we've got more to cover with\n\n554\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.850\nthat user interface, but we're gonna have\nto come back for a part two for that.\n\n555\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.390\nSo, for now I hope you guys\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n556\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.140\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n557\n00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:47.920\n>> I'm Vaughn Smith.\n\n558\n00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.554\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n559\n00:26:49.554 -->

host\n\n3\n00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:17.490\nMike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.840\nToday we're doing our\nAdobe Illustrator Creative Cloud.\n\n5\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.260\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.400\nwe're going to be taking\na look at the user interface.\n\n7\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.100\nNow we've already done a part\none of this there's a lot to\n\n8\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.360\nthe interface in Adobe Illustrator.\n\n9\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.280\nSo if you missed that one or\n\n10\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.020\nif you haven't watched some of it yet\nmake sure you go back and check that out.\n\n11\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.180\nIt goes over a lot of the basics and we're\njust going to be continuing on from there.\n\n12\n00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.110\nAnd here to help us is Vonne Smith.\n\n13\n00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.120\nHow's it going Vonne?\n\n14\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.960\n>> Good.\nHello again.\n\n15\n00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.817\nWe're going to continue on as Mike\nsaid with part two of the interface.\n\n16\n00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:47.968\nYou're thinking two episodes for\njust the interface alone?\n\n17\n00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:48.550\nYeah.\n\n18\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.490\nThere's a lot to it.\n\n19\n00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.510\n>> It is a pretty complex interface.\n\n20\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.630\n>> Yes.\n>> But very customizable.\n\n21\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.550\nThat's what's really cool about it is\nyou can set it up any way you want\n\n22\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.110\nit to make it work for you.\n\n23\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.050\nLike they designed it with you in mind.\n\n24\n00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.550\n>> Exactly.\n\n25\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.090\nIt's all about me.\n\n26\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.880\nIt's all about how I, you,\nwant to set up your environment\n\n27\n00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.870\nto have everything in front of you,\nhave all of your crayons,\n\n28\n00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.900\nnicely arranged so\nyou can pick them up when you need to and\n\n29\n00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.980\nbe able to access everything you need\nto create super awesome graphics.\n\n30\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.580\n>> Fantastic.\n\n31\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.990\nAll right, well where do we start next?\n\n32\n00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.600\n>> All right.\n\n33\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.640\nTwo things that I wanted to mention but\n\n34\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.470\njust kinda slipped my mind as we were\ngoing through because we were having so\n\n35\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.650\nmuch fun moving these panels around and\ndocking them, and and closing them, and\n\n36\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.610\ndouble clicking and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n37\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.500\nThe Window menu as we mentioned earlier\nis where you can find all of your panels.\n\n38\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.280\nOkay?\n\n39\n00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.570\nIf you're a Photoshop user,\nif you're looking for\n\n40\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.450\nthe History panel,\nit doesn't live in Illustrator.\n\n41\n00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.750\nIt doesn't exist.\n\n42\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.240\nSo, there is no History,\nyou just have to Undo.\n\n43\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.060\nAnd the History panel.\n\n44\n00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.360\n>> Yeah,\nthat was pretty convenient I know,\n\n45\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.580\nbecause it lets you jump\nback to a specific point.\n\n46\n00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.080\nYou can kinda see all the steps and\n\n47\n00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.230\ngo to a specific one where you now go,\nthat's where I want to go to.\n\n48\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.900\nNo more of that.\n\n49\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.000\nYou just have to undo, undo, undo, undo\nuntil you get to where you want to be.\n\n50\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.580\n>> Pretty much.\n\n51\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.090\n>> Yeah.\n>> Keep on.\n\n52\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.290\nClick, click, click, click,\nclick with that keyboard shortcut.\n\n53\n00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.790\n>> Yup.\n>> So, yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.520\nYou can't just jump back.\n\n55\n00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.170\nSo that's something.\n\n56\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.810\nAnd while we're still on this Window menu,\n\n57\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.310\nI wanted to mention the application\nframe and what is it.\n\n58\n00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.360\nIt's always on in CC by default.\n\n59\n00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.030\nSo you probably won't ever see this off.\n\n60\n00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.980\nBut in case it ever does turn off by\nsome reason, why don't I do it so\n\n61\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.792\nI can show you?\n\n62\n00:02:27.792 --> 00:02:30.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's see through.\n\n63\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.214\nYeah.\n>> It looks\n\n64\n00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:32.895\nlike half your program is missing.\n\n65\n00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:34.135\n>> Right?\nYeah.\n\n66\n00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:37.595\nAnd I remember because I'm bilingual.\n\n67\n00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:39.335\nI can work on both Windows and Mac.\n\n68\n00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:41.445\nI have been that way for a long time.\n\n69\n00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:46.385\nBut I did start out using Illustrator\nlong ago just on a Windows machine and\n\n70\n00:02:46.385 --> 00:02:48.807\nthen I got a Mac, you know,\nhad to get a Mac.\n\n71\n00:02:48.807 --> 00:02:49.485\n>> Had to.\n>> Yeah.\n\n72\n00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:52.785\nAnd then I loaded up\nIllustrator on my computer,\n\n73\n00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:54.555\nI don't even remember what version it was.\n\n74\n00:02:54.555 --> 00:02:57.350\nThen it's just like, where's the back?\n\n75\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.050\nLike I was so used to having that back,\nthat it was just weird.\n\n76\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.185\nI was like, I can see my mountains.\n\n77\n00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:08.560\n[LAUGH] I'd like to not see that\ncuz it was just throwing me off.\n\n78\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.990\nAnd then I had to look it up\ncuz I couldn't figure it out.\n\n79\n00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.490\nAnd it was the application frame.\n\n80\n00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.880\nAs soon as I click that I'm like,\nthat's what I want.\n\n81\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.060\nIt's like, okay there's my back.\n\n82\n00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.660\nI don't need to see my desktop.\n\n83\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.530\nAnd half my program isn't missing and\nI can just move on my merry way.\n\n84\n00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.190\n>> Fantastic.\n\n85\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.332\n>> So two little notes that I wanted\nto point out about history and\n\n86\n00:03:28.332 --> 00:03:29.400\napplication frame.\n\n87\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.570\n>> We appreciate that.\n\n88\n00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.070\n>> You're welcome.\n\n89\n00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.760\nSo, let's move on.\n\n90\n00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.350\nLet's open up a file now, because\nwe're looking at all the panels and\n\n91\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.420\ntools and everything and they're all\nkind of empty, so let's do that.\n\n92\n00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.440\nYou can do a file menu and\nthen go to open and all of your menus.\n\n93\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.350\nYou can always see on the right hand\nside that you have the keyboard shortcut\n\n94\n00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.020\nover to the right of what\nthat command equates to.\n\n95\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.060\nSo here since I'm on a Mac\nit is showing the command o.\n\n96\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.540\nIn Windows you would see the,\nwhatever the control sign looks like.\n\n97\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.407\nI actually forgot what\nit looks like right now.\n\n98\n00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:06.700\n.\n>> I was just trying to think of it while\n\n99\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.300\nyou're talking about it, but I'm not sure.\n\n100\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.450\n>> Right?\nGood, okay I'm not alone then.\n\n101\n00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.130\n>> Wait, I think it's a chevron.\n\n102\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.010\n>> Is that what it is?\n\n103\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.015\n>> I think, yes.\n\n104\n00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:13.650\nBut I'm not, eh.\n\n105\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.424\n>> It'll say, it'll,\n\n106\n00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:16.797\njust whatever it looks like in Windows,\nthat's what it looks like.\n\n107\n00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:17.553\n[LAUGH]\n>> Buy a Mac.\n\n108\n00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:21.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just come on over.\n\n109\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.880\nSo you can see that it is Cmd+O and,\nactually,\n\n110\n00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.770\nsince I am bilingual and\nI did kind of start on Windows,\n\n111\n00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.990\nyou'll probably hear me interchange\nCmd and Ctrl all the time.\n\n112\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.090\nCuz it was my when I was teaching this for\nmany, many years I would teach on\n\n113\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.300\na Windows machine and so I learned all\nthe Windows shortcuts, it's just Ctrl.\n\n114\n00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.520\nAnd so it's.\n\n115\n00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.330\n>> So interchange Cmd, Ctrl when we're\ntalking about those keyboard shortcuts.\n\n116\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.140\n>> Yeah and really when you go back and\n\n117\n00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.620\nforth with a Mac it's just you know\ndo you go in or do you go out.\n\n118\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.665\nYou know Ctrl is on the outside.\n\n119\n00:04:56.665 --> 00:05:01.840\nCtrl or Cmd is on the inside so it takes\na little muscle memory to remember that.\n\n120\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.750\nSo anyways, long story about file open but\none of the little\n\n121\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.760\nfun thing, if you want to say, if you\ndouble click in the application frame,\n\n122\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.060\nin this open area of any of your Adobe\nproducts is actually the shortcut,\n\n123\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.530\nif you want to say, to file open as well.\n\n124\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.460\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah, so you can just double click,\n\n125\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.290\nthere you go.\n\n126\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.940\nI'm opening up to a folder that I\nhave some exercise files ready for\n\n127\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.428\nthis class or episode or tutorial,\nwhatever we wanna call these things.\n\n128\n00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:33.780\n[LAUGH] And,\nI went to go do my favorite shortcut.\n\n129\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.180\n>> I saw your hand on the keyboard.\n\n130\n00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.400\nIt's habit, wasn't it?\n\n131\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.700\n>> Exactly, yeah,\nit's like open a file Cmd+O.\n\n132\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.080\nWell, actually it's not O it's zero,\nsorry.\n\n133\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.560\nO, zero, yeah,\ncuz they actually do different things.\n\n134\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.731\n>> So what does Cmd+0 do?\n\n135\n00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:52.000\n>> Cmd+0 is fit to screen.\n\n136\n00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.130\nIt's in all of your Adobe products,\nso it's, It's always there.\n\n137\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.230\nIt's in your View menu, so let's look\nat this View menu for a little bit.\n\n138\n00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.260\nNow do I actually go to\nthe View menu to do this?\n\n139\n00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.680\nNo, I'd use the shortcuts,\nobviously, like I just said.\n\n140\n00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.030\nBut I wanted to just point them out right\nhere, is that you have Fit All in Window.\n\n141\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.120\nThere's also something called\nFit Artboard in Window, but\n\n142\n00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.700\nthat's, that's actually the command\nthat I'm talking about.\n\n143\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.890\nWe'll talk about what an artboard\nis in just a little bit.\n\n144\n00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.700\nBut then there's this other command.\n\n145\n00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.160\nSorry, I'm getting\na little ahead of myself.\n\n146\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.560\nBut we will talk about artboards and\n\n147\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.530\nwhat they all mean in much\nmore detail in later episodes.\n\n148\n00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.980\nBut there is Zoom In,\nthere's Zoom Out, there's Ctrl+0 or,\n\n149\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.860\nsee I already did it, Cmd+0 and\nthose are your big ones.\n\n150\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.400\nOkay, so if I go ahead and say Ctrl or\n\n151\n00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.720\nCmd+0 it fits this whole\nartboard in my screen.\n\n152\n00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.170\nOkay, so Artboard, right?\n\n153\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.450\nIt's really the document that you have.\n\n154\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.480\nLike, this is the space.\n\n155\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.640\nYou can actually see that this\nblack line all the way around\n\n156\n00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.035\nthat is the size of\nthe document that I have here.\n\n157\n00:07:00.035 --> 00:07:02.080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This is actually an 8.5 by 11,\n\n158\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.180\njust regular paper size that,\nthat's what I got.\n\n159\n00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.690\nThere's my artboard.\n\n160\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.560\nYou can actually have multiple\nartboards on Illustrator.\n\n161\n00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.490\nBut that's later.\n\n162\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.220\n>> Okay.\n\n163\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.400\n>> And if you can see we have some little\nred lines, figure I'd just go ahead and\n\n164\n00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.000\npoint this out.\n\n165\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.768\nSee I'm already using shortcuts and\nI'm not telling you guys what I'm doing.\n\n166\n00:07:19.768 --> 00:07:24.320\n[LAUGH] But there are these\nlittle red lines around those,\n\n167\n00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.720\nthis guy, those are known as bleeds\nbecause this document is set up\n\n168\n00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.420\nas a print document,\nand, long story short,\n\n169\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.145\nbleeds are the colored edge to\nthe printed edge of a paper.\n\n170\n00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:39.995\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I'm sure you see it all the time.\n\n171\n00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:41.200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If the color goes all\n\n172\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.965\nthe way to the edge.\n\n173\n00:07:41.965 --> 00:07:42.890\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Is, actually,\n\n174\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.430\nwhen you set up the artwork,\nyou're setting it up with bleeds.\n\n175\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.820\n>> Okay.\n>> You can't get it on a regular\n\n176\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.685\ndesktop printer.\n\n177\n00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:49.535\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> For the most part\n\n178\n00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:50.798\n>> But high end printers,\n\n179\n00:07:50.798 --> 00:07:54.334\nthey can print to the very edge of\nthe paper where you don't have any\n\n180\n00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:55.165\nmargin at all.\n\n181\n00:07:55.165 --> 00:07:58.786\n>> And when you're sending things to, for\ncommercial printing where you're going to\n\n182\n00:07:58.786 --> 00:08:02.369\nhave like you know A thousand copies made,\nand all the nice flyers and everything.\n\n183\n00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:05.937\nYou have to set up your artwork to\nhave bleeds that go all the way out to\n\n184\n00:08:05.937 --> 00:08:07.270\nthe side.\n\n185\n00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.120\nAnd normal bleeds about\nan eighth of an inch.\n\n186\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.810\nUsually, you have to actually ask your\nprinter for their specific specifications.\n\n187\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.829\nBut that's usually the industry standard.\n\n188\n00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:19.022\nI've got some other things going on\nin those documents specifically,\n\n189\n00:08:19.022 --> 00:08:19.760\nwith this white stuff.\n\n190\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.100\nBut, we don't have to\nworry about that [LAUGH].\n\n191\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.110\nOkay, so those are your shortcuts that\nI said, control zero, fit and screen.\n\n192\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:35.110\nControl plus or remember back in the view\nmenu or command plus that's zoom in.\n\n193\n00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.890\nSo, I can zoom in and\nI can move in or I can do command or\n\n194\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.410\ncontrol minus, and that zooms out.\n\n195\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:47.050\n>> Okay.\n>> So out, in, all.\n\n196\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.840\nAnd they're all right next to each other,\nup there on the top row of your keyboard.\n\n197\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.920\nSo the zero, the minus, the plus,\nthey're all right there.\n\n198\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.189\nSo, it's kinda like a second\nnature to me to do those.\n\n199\n00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.330\nBut, if you wanted to have other ways\nof doing it, cuz of course there's\n\n200\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.200\nmillions of these, well not millions but\nthere's a couple of ways.\n\n201\n00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.050\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> You also have your zoom tool over in\n\n202\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:08.960\nyour toolbox.\n\n203\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.282\nRemember that hockey thing\nthat wasn't working?\n\n204\n00:09:11.282 --> 00:09:11.828\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n205\n00:09:11.828 --> 00:09:15.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's working now because it is.\n\n206\n00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.590\n>> The fact that it's open.\n\n207\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.680\n>> Yeah, so I actually clicked the z\non the keyboard and it jumped over to\n\n208\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.810\nthe zoom tool, just show you the h,\ncuz you guess the hand tool, right?\n\n209\n00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.190\nIt switches over to the h and the z.\n\n210\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.680\nSo, you can use your hotkeys, or you can\nclick the tool, and it becomes your zoom.\n\n211\n00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.462\nAnd it has the little plus sign, and\nthen you can go ahead and just click,\n\n212\n00:09:35.462 --> 00:09:36.336\nclick, click.\n\n213\n00:09:36.336 --> 00:09:40.480\nAnd it's actually zooming in\nto wherever I'm clicking on.\n\n214\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.324\nSo, it's kinda focusing or\ncentralizing on that section.\n\n215\n00:09:43.324 --> 00:09:46.141\nNow, zooming out with the zoom tool,\n\n216\n00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:51.260\nit's all about that keyboard,\nthe alt-key or the option key.\n\n217\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.968\nSo, alt or option, you turns the minus\nsign in the zoom and then you just click,\n\n218\n00:09:55.968 --> 00:09:58.550\nclick, click and it zooms out.\n\n219\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:05.140\nLet go of the alt or option, click,\nclick, click, and you can zoom it.\n\n220\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.878\nThe, sorry, I did Ctrl+0 again.\n\n221\n00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:11.781\n[LAUGH] The hand tool,\nthe hand tool, it's kinda of like,\n\n222\n00:10:11.781 --> 00:10:16.253\nif this is a piece of paper,\nme taking my hand and moving it around.\n\n223\n00:10:16.253 --> 00:10:18.268\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n224\n00:10:18.268 --> 00:10:23.380\n>> I'm not moving items in the document,\nI'm moving what I'm seeing.\n\n225\n00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.374\n>> Especially useful when you're\nzooming in and working on things,\n\n226\n00:10:26.374 --> 00:10:27.982\nyou can slide the document around.\n\n227\n00:10:27.982 --> 00:10:30.547\n>> Yeah, let's demonstrate.\n\n228\n00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:34.592\nSo, I'm going to use my keyboard\nshortcuts of Ctrl + plus, plus, plus, or\n\n229\n00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.168\nwhatever way you wanna do it.\n\n230\n00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:40.334\nSo, I'm kinda focused or\ncentralized on Spring Festival, but\n\n231\n00:10:40.334 --> 00:10:42.430\nI want to kinda move down.\n\n232\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.090\nSo, if I use my hand tool\nwhich I have right now.\n\n233\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.730\nAnd I just click and just kinda click,\nhold and drag and just kind of move it up.\n\n234\n00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.100\nMove it up and so,\nI can kinda come down here.\n\n235\n00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.375\nLet's say that we're going to,\nMay 14th is where we're going,\n\n236\n00:10:56.375 --> 00:10:58.380\nthe date of the spring festival.\n\n237\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.810\nClick, hold and drag, click, hold and\n\n238\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.660\ndrag, come over here to this\nother side of the document.\n\n239\n00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.360\nDo whatever I need to do around there and\nthen I can do that.\n\n240\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.970\nThere is another little shortcut,\nif you want.\n\n241\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.730\nIf you double-click the hand tool, and\n\n242\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.870\nyou can't see me doing it with all these\nthings, but here, let me zoom in again.\n\n243\n00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.898\nI just double-clicked [SOUND] over here.\n\n244\n00:11:18.898 --> 00:11:22.253\nDouble-click on the hand tool actually\nis a shortcut for Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0.\n\n245\n00:11:22.253 --> 00:11:23.229\nIt's actually fit in screen.\n\n246\n00:11:23.229 --> 00:11:24.450\nSo, if you wanna do that.\n\n247\n00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.407\n>> But like you said, obviously there's\nmore than one way to do everything.\n\n248\n00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:29.110\n>> Yep, yeah [LAUGH] A lot of ways.\n\n249\n00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.150\nI never use those tools,\nI never use those menu commands.\n\n250\n00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.590\nI still do them,\nI just do it all through shortcuts.\n\n251\n00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:43.050\nSo, control zero, control minus,\ncontrol plus then the other ones that\n\n252\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:48.240\nI call part of the big six is\nthe toggles as we call it.\n\n253\n00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.820\nIt's like, I wanna temporarily use that\ntool without actually switching to\n\n254\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.680\nthe tool and having to switch back\nto the tool I have in my hand.\n\n255\n00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.150\nI just wanna zoom in, move around, but\n\n256\n00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.130\nalways stay in this black arrow\ntool that I have right now.\n\n257\n00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.720\nCuz right now, I just have the select\ntool that I've got going on, and\n\n258\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.470\nso, don't wanna switch.\n\n259\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.820\nYou hold your command and a spacebar down.\n\n260\n00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.860\nSo, you keep those keys held down.\n\n261\n00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.447\nSo, command or control spacebar, it\nactually shows the mouse cursor icon that\n\n262\n00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:22.480\nyou have a zoom and then I can click,\nclick, click, click and kinda move around.\n\n263\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.700\nI let got of my keys and\nnow I'm still in the black tool.\n\n264\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.306\nI used the zoom and I stayed in the tool.\n\n265\n00:12:31.306 --> 00:12:33.190\n>> Nice.\n>> Very, very handy, so\n\n266\n00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.010\nCtrl+0 to zoom back out.\n\n267\n00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.230\nSomething you can do with that\nzoom tool instead of click, click,\n\n268\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.290\nclick is you can do what\nI call a zoom marquee.\n\n269\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.852\nYou click, hold and drag with\nthe zoom tool to make a rectangle or\n\n270\n00:12:46.852 --> 00:12:49.316\nwhatever a space that you want to.\n\n271\n00:12:49.316 --> 00:12:54.459\nThat becomes my zoom, and it just goes.\n\n272\n00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:57.153\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> So, I'm gonna use my toggle again,\n\n273\n00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:58.748\nI'm gonna use my control spacebar.\n\n274\n00:12:58.748 --> 00:13:00.490\nI'm gonna click hold and drag.\n\n275\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.260\nSo, I'm dragging a little box\naround that arts and crafts.\n\n276\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:09.810\nI let go of my mouse, I let go of\nmy keyboard and now I've zoomed in.\n\n277\n00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.230\nNow I'm doing that very, very slowly,\nbut I did wanna emphasize.\n\n278\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.847\nI let go of the mouse first and\n\n279\n00:13:13.847 --> 00:13:17.693\nthen let go of the keys because if\nyou don't keep the keys held down,\n\n280\n00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:21.829\nit's gonna stop toggling, and\nthen it's gonna kinda do weird things.\n\n281\n00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:26.421\nSo, I can get to a specific zoom\nmagnification that I wanna get to by\n\n282\n00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:31.431\ntoggling to the zoom tool, get in\nthat marquee, going where I wanna be.\n\n283\n00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:32.011\nAnd there you go.\n\n284\n00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:35.730\nNow, while I'm here,\nI wanna, I'm zoomed in.\n\n285\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.160\nI like the zoom magnification, but\n\n286\n00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.800\nI wanna kinda move over to the,\nsomething with the treats.\n\n287\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.220\nI can't remember what's over there.\n\n288\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.550\nSo, my temporary toggle to access\nmy hand tool is just the space bar.\n\n289\n00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:53.070\nSo, I hold the space bar down, got that\nlittle hand, I click hold and drag.\n\n290\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.003\nTasty Treats that's what it says [LAUGH].\n\n291\n00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:58.330\nSo, we've got Tasty Treats right here,\nI let go of the mouse.\n\n292\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.100\nI let go of the key and now I'm here.\n\n293\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.950\nSo, use that space bar.\n\n294\n00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.950\nI can kinda drag round until\nI'm where I need to be.\n\n295\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.030\nI move over here, now I'm there.\n\n296\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.080\nI need to zoom out just a little bit,\ncontrol minus,\n\n297\n00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.730\nbecause I need to see all the flowers.\n\n298\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:13.830\nOkay, I do what I need to do.\n\n299\n00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.856\nNow, I need to see the whole\ndocument again, so control zero.\n\n300\n00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.709\nNow I need to zoom back down in here\non Lucky's Orchard, command space,\n\n301\n00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:25.010\nhold those keys, click hold and drag,\nmake a box, okay little too much.\n\n302\n00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:30.257\nSo, you can see that just using\nthose alone can just move your.\n\n303\n00:14:30.257 --> 00:14:32.440\nHalf a time and you're like,\nwow you're doing so many things.\n\n304\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.230\nI'm like, I'm just zooming.\n\n305\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.250\n[LAUGH] I'm actually not doing anything.\n\n306\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.810\nI'm just moving around the documents.\n\n307\n00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.663\n>> Don't tell everybody that.\n\n308\n00:14:38.663 --> 00:14:39.174\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n309\n00:14:39.174 --> 00:14:43.400\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nyou can look pretty great that way.\n\n310\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.051\nSo that was, I said six, didn't I?\n\n311\n00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.100\n>> Mm-hm, the big six.\n\n312\n00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:47.901\n>> If you're counting.\n\n313\n00:14:47.901 --> 00:14:48.986\n>> Let's see, we've got.\n\n314\n00:14:48.986 --> 00:14:50.588\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can't remember now.\n\n315\n00:14:50.588 --> 00:14:51.238\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n316\n00:14:51.238 --> 00:14:52.760\n>> You've got the Ctrl+0, right?\n\n317\n00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.510\nWe talked about that.\n\n318\n00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:58.180\nYou've got the Ctrl+minus and\nthe Ctrl+plus, we've got the zoom tool.\n\n319\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:58.960\n>> Toggle to the zoom.\n\n320\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.925\n>> Toggle to the zoom, toggle to the hand.\n\n321\n00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:01.970\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n322\n00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:02.690\nWe're one short.\n\n323\n00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.559\n>> Exactly.\n\n324\n00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:04.261\n>> That's our last one.\n\n325\n00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:10.183\n>> [LAUGH] Our last one that you can\nuse to zoom in is if you have a mouse,\n\n326\n00:15:10.183 --> 00:15:15.919\nnow if you're on a touchpad it's\nnot gonna necessarily work.\n\n327\n00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:18.677\nBut, I know now you can do it\nwith gestures and everything, but\n\n328\n00:15:18.677 --> 00:15:20.980\nif you are using a mouse\nbecause I like to use a mouse.\n\n329\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.447\nIf you hold your alt key or option,\nhold the ALT OPT key and scrolly wheel up.\n\n330\n00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:32.079\nYou can actually scrolly in, like zoom in,\nand the technical term is scrolly.\n\n331\n00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:34.625\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so you scrolly wheel up,\n\n332\n00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:37.820\nyou scrolly wheel down and\nyou can zoom in and out.\n\n333\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.420\nAnd it will actually focus\nwherever your mouse is located.\n\n334\n00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.330\nSee I'm zoom there, move my mouse down and\nsee how I'm kinda focusing down on there.\n\n335\n00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.586\nSo, holding that alt and scrolling with\nyour mouse will actually move you to that\n\n336\n00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:53.651\nspecific [INAUDIBLE] So,\nthat's the sixth one.\n\n337\n00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:54.989\n>> There we go.\n\n338\n00:15:54.989 --> 00:15:56.495\nThe suspense was killing me.\n\n339\n00:15:56.495 --> 00:15:57.475\nI'm glad you got that one out.\n\n340\n00:15:57.475 --> 00:16:00.647\n>> [LAUGH] Good, I'm glad, I'm glad.\n\n341\n00:16:00.647 --> 00:16:03.372\nSo that's all the basics of zooming,\n\n342\n00:16:03.372 --> 00:16:08.070\nwanted to do one last thing with\nwork with multiple files, okay.\n\n343\n00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.810\nAnd these little tear offs are kind of\nin the way, so let me just go ahead and\n\n344\n00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:12.320\nclose this off.\n\n345\n00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.850\nAnd I know since it's a tear off,\nthe tool's still here.\n\n346\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:21.210\nI'm not actually removing it out\nof the tool dock, it's just a,\n\n347\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.770\nit's almost like a copy if you wanna say,\nlike a tear, a tored off, tored?\n\n348\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:25.619\n>> Torn off?\n>> Torn.\n\n349\n00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:26.282\nYeah, thank you.\n\n350\n00:16:26.282 --> 00:16:29.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Torn off copy of those tools.\n\n351\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.120\nAll right, so\nlet's open up a couple more files.\n\n352\n00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.540\nI did Cmd+ O right there.\n\n353\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.830\nSo let's open up this one,\nand let's go there,\n\n354\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:41.590\nand then maybe we'll open\nup one more just for fun.\n\n355\n00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.970\nLet's go with the Orchard logo, okay.\n\n356\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.930\nSo I have three files that\nare open in Illustrator.\n\n357\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.730\nHow do I know, because I've\ngot three tabs across the top.\n\n358\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.860\nOkay, so I can see they're in the tabs,\n\n359\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.980\njust like you have the tabs\nof the panels over there.\n\n360\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:02.080\nIt tabulates or, yeah it just goes,\nit actually is called consolidating,\n\n361\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.450\nI think, and\nit puts all of the files in tabs.\n\n362\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.460\nYou just click on them,\nyou can double click,\n\n363\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.160\nbut it doesn't really matter in there.\n\n364\n00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.510\nYou can close them and all that,\nthat's fine, that's cool.\n\n365\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.910\nYou can undock them, and\nthat will throw people off sometimes.\n\n366\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.240\nPeople will actually undock, whether\nit's a multiple file or a single file,\n\n367\n00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.290\nyou undock it from this area and then it\nbecomes its own free-floating window.\n\n368\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:35.253\nAnd I've had people where they'll go ahead\nand they're like, I've lost everything.\n\n369\n00:17:35.253 --> 00:17:36.551\n>> Yes, the happy face is gone.\n\n370\n00:17:36.551 --> 00:17:39.930\n>> Yeah, exactly, I'm like where\nare my tools and what is going on?\n\n371\n00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.520\nIt's just because you've\nactually un-docked the file and\n\n372\n00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.360\nthen like, you've made it big,\n\n373\n00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.160\nso you've got to kind of just, well,\nactually I did it a little too quickly.\n\n374\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.340\nBut you can just take that title bar,\nof that file and\n\n375\n00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.050\njust kind of, bring it and dock it back\nin just like we're docking the panels.\n\n376\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.248\nAll right, so\nyou can dock your files there too.\n\n377\n00:17:58.248 --> 00:18:00.630\n>> That would be useful then with\nmultiple monitor setup maybe?\n\n378\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.280\n>> Yeah.\n\n379\n00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.100\n>> Where I could move that into\nits own monitor or something.\n\n380\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.300\n>> Yeah, I work on 2 monitors too, so\nI mean, there are times where I wanna pull\n\n381\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.095\none file out of another and\njust kind of move them off to the side.\n\n382\n00:18:10.095 --> 00:18:11.500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n383\n00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.120\nAnd you can still use\nyour interface with it.\n\n384\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.000\nIt's just really however\nyou want to do it.\n\n385\n00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.960\nBut it is something to take notice of.\n\n386\n00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.910\nAnd that actually prompted me for this.\n\n387\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.920\nIt just popped in my head.\n\n388\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.420\n>> Something that you should be careful of\nwhen working in actually a lot of Adobe\n\n389\n00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.340\nproducts, is because remember I just like,\nI took that so let me just back up.\n\n390\n00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.690\nI know, suspense, right?\n\n391\n00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.280\n>> Yep.\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n392\n00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.680\nI expanded it and you're like,\nwhere are my tools?\n\n393\n00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.850\nAnd I don't know where to go and\nI've lost all my tools.\n\n394\n00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.520\nWell, you can also lose all your tools,\nas you wanna say, by hitting the tab key.\n\n395\n00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.420\n>> Yeah, like, by itself.\n\n396\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.970\nYeah, so it's what happened?\n\n397\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.370\nSo just be careful if you ever hit\nthe tab key while you're working.\n\n398\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.710\nIt's just kinda hiding everything.\n\n399\n00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:55.530\nJust hit it again, it comes back so.\n\n400\n00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.020\n>> Just giving you a little more real\nestate to temporary look at your\n\n401\n00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.390\ndocument that you're working with maybe?\n\n402\n00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.280\n>> Yeah, and it scares people\nwhen you're like, what happened?\n\n403\n00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.620\nAnd so that's what you do.\n\n404\n00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.890\nBut you can always,\nif you ever need to, remember,\n\n405\n00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.090\nyou can always reset your work space.\n\n406\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.310\nYou can always go back\nto your window menu.\n\n407\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.860\nSo you do have your your fallbacks.\n\n408\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.440\n>> Yeah, so don't panic, all is not lost.\n\n409\n00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.110\n>> Exactly, just calm, breathe, and\n\n410\n00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.270\nremember this really long episode\nabout the interface of Illustrator.\n\n411\n00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.470\nSo a few more things about open files.\n\n412\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:27.290\nThey're in tabs.\n\n413\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:34.770\nYou can arrange them very similarly\nto what you can do in Photoshop.\n\n414\n00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.885\nYou can put them next to each other,\nlet me just show you.\n\n415\n00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.300\nSee this guy right up here,\nacross the top?\n\n416\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.340\nThere is this arrange documents button,\n\n417\n00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.750\njust like the same documents\nbutton in Photoshop.\n\n418\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:49.920\nAnd it has the same command, so\nyou can see that If I put them two up,\n\n419\n00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.510\nor vertical, or horizontal, so\nif I have three files, I can do three up.\n\n420\n00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:58.090\nAnd then it arranges all\nof my files in this order.\n\n421\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.060\nOr I can put them next to each other.\n\n422\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.042\nNow two up, but I have three, so\nsee, it puts two of them on one and\n\n423\n00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:04.540\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n424\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:09.060\nSo you can use all of these different\nways of arranging you files or\n\n425\n00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.510\nyour multiple open files within\nIllustrator with that button.\n\n426\n00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.450\nAnd you can see, remember we talked\nabout consolidating, I said,\n\n427\n00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:20.260\nthat's because that top item or\nthat top option of consolidate\n\n428\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.270\nall means bring that all together\nin that tab format, across the top.\n\n429\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.062\n>> Very good, well all right, Van.\n\n430\n00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:30.610\nThat's again, a lot of information or\na part two about this interface.\n\n431\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:31.500\nThere's just a lot to it,\n\n432\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.120\nand a lot of ways that you can customize\nit it to make it work best for you.\n\n433\n00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.520\nCan you think of anything else you want\nto throw out there for our viewers?\n\n434\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.940\n>> One last little shortcut,\nif you're working on multiple files and\n\n435\n00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.880\nyou want to cycle through them,\nlike, instead of clicking on them.\n\n436\n00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.700\nCuz I'm all about keyboard shortcuts,\nright?\n\n437\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:54.280\nYou can do a Cmd+ ~, the enye,\nremember the little tilde button up there?\n\n438\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.428\nSo if you do Ctrl+ or Cmd+ ~, you see it\njust actually cycles me through all of my\n\n439\n00:20:58.428 --> 00:21:02.759\nopen files, and there's sometimes where I\nhave a lot of files and it's like [SOUND],\n\n440\n00:21:02.759 --> 00:21:03.866\ngo right through it.\n\n441\n00:21:03.866 --> 00:21:05.866\nAnd that's my last tip.\n\n442\n00:21:05.866 --> 00:21:07.003\n>> Fantastic, love it.\n\n443\n00:21:07.003 --> 00:21:07.910\n>> And I'm done.\n\n444\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.690\nLove all the customization you do,\n\n445\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.700\nlove all the keyboard shortcuts\nthat you're teaching us.\n\n446\n00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.910\nLike I said, watching Vonn work\non these programs is amazing,\n\n447\n00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.550\nthe keyboard shortcuts that she uses,\nyou can just tell,\n\n448\n00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.445\nsomebody like me that's new to this\nprogram, I'm using the mouse and\n\n449\n00:21:22.445 --> 00:21:25.060\nI'm clicking on each one of\nthose those tools one at a time.\n\n450\n00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.200\nIt'll take me 15 minutes to do something,\n\n451\n00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.890\nVon's done in 3 because she's doing these\nkeyboard shortcuts and all the other\n\n452\n00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.070\nmagic that she's gonna share with you guys\nthroughout the rest of these episodes.\n\n453\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.570\nSo we thank you for that, Von.\n\n454\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:36.270\nWe appreciate it.\n\n455\n00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.260\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n456\n00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.240\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n457\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.970\n>> I'm Von Smith.\n\n458\n00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.072\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:21:43.072 --> 00:21:50.740\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:16.895\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:21.062\nAnd today we're going over\nAdobe illustrators CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:23.240\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.290\nwe're gonna be focusing in on how we\ncan select items within our file.\n\n7\n00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.230\nAnd we've gotta be able to select\nthe item if we wanna manipulate it,\n\n8\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.520\nwork with it, and all of that fun stuff.\n\n9\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.970\nSo, a very important part of\nbeing efficient with illustrator.\n\n10\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.210\nSo, here to help us with all that is Ms.\nVaughn Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.870\nHow's it going Vaughn?\n\n12\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.208\n>> Good, glad to be back.\n\n13\n00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:44.600\nYes, we are gonna go over selecting\nitems and think selecting items, there's\n\n14\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.180\na whole episode about just selecting\nthat are just click on something, right?\n\n15\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.220\nClick it, done.\n\n16\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.150\n>> We're done, right?\n\n17\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.730\nThat's it.\n\n18\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.660\n>> Yeah,\nit goes a little deeper than that.\n\n19\n00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.380\nSo, and I really wanna make sure that\nyou guys understand everything there is\n\n20\n00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.710\nto navigating, and not necessarily\nnavigating, just working within a file.\n\n21\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.430\nAnd what do all these items do?\n\n22\n00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.400\nWhat are all these colors going on?\n\n23\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.240\nSo, let's just jump right into it.\n\n24\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.300\n>> These Illustrator documents\ncan start getting complex.\n\n25\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.110\nA lot of different pieces within it.\n\n26\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.390\nAnd if you select the wrong thing and\ndrag it the wrong way,\n\n27\n00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.050\nyou can end up goofing up\nyou whole project, right?\n\n28\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.780\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.090\nAnd it's always those super basic\nthings that always trip people up,\n\n30\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.080\nthat's what I find.\n\n31\n00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.870\nAnd so that's why we're gonna go\nover it really in depth [LAUGH].\n\n32\n00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.770\n>> Fantastic, I like it,\nlet's get started.\n\n33\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.840\n>> All right, so,\nI've already got a file opened here.\n\n34\n00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.434\nIt is the select basic that I've\ngot going in my exercise files.\n\n35\n00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:41.375\nSo, you can see lots of pretty\ncolors in here and it's like,\n\n36\n00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:44.106\nwow this is a really nice\nlooking document, isn't it?\n\n37\n00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:44.639\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, yes.\n\n38\n00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:45.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n39\n00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.540\nSo, but this is really just for\ndemonstration purposes,\n\n40\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.400\nso I can let you all know.\n\n41\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.120\nSo I did already a CTRL 0 or CMD 0 so\n\n42\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.860\nI can go ahead and fit the document in\nmy screen so that's all I'm seeing.\n\n43\n00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.250\nThis document or I guess we should really\nstart talking about this as the art board.\n\n44\n00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.420\nOkay, cuz this is the place\nwhere all of my stuff is on.\n\n45\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.090\nOkay.\n\n46\n00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.670\nAnd right now I'm just\nseeing this one art board.\n\n47\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.310\nWell, actually this particular\nfile has multiple art works.\n\n48\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.810\n>> Really?\n>> Yes.\n\n49\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.800\n>> It doesn't look like it.\n\n50\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.740\n>> It doesn't, does it?\n\n51\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.830\nI did that on purpose [LAUGH] so\n\n52\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.930\nyou wouldn't be distracted like\nwhat's that kind sitting over there?\n\n53\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.320\nSo, how do I know that there\nis multiple art boards?\n\n54\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.610\nWell, I created the files.\n\n55\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.170\nI know it's in there.\n\n56\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.650\nBut, that's something you should always\nkinda look for in your documents.\n\n57\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.840\nAnd one place that you can find out\nright now, I know it's on number 2.\n\n58\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.940\nWouldn't it usually start with 1?\n\n59\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.510\n>> Yes.\n>> Yeah, because this area right here is\n\n60\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.100\nactually where you can navigate\nacross multiple art boards.\n\n61\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.336\nAnd so you can see I did a really good\njob of naming Art Board Number Three.\n\n62\n00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.960\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n63\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.780\n>> So, nothing.\n\n64\n00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.130\nSo you can switch back and\n\n65\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.630\nforth between these multiple\nart boards by going down here.\n\n66\n00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.560\n>> So this is still one file.\n\n67\n00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.700\nJust multiple art boards within that file.\n\n68\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.440\n>> Correct.\n\n69\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.040\nSo, this is just a way that if I'm doing,\n\n70\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.740\nlet's say I'm doing a project where\nI'm doing a business card and\n\n71\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.210\na flyer at the same time like that's\nthe something I'm gonna print.\n\n72\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.730\nInstead of having two separates files\nwith one having the business card and\n\n73\n00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.420\none the flyer, you can have it in\none file with multiple art boards.\n\n74\n00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.920\n>> So you can send that one file at\na printer and you're good to go?\n\n75\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.480\n>> Yes and\n\n76\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.550\nif you think about it the business card is\nprobably gonna have a logos, addresses,\n\n77\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.230\nthings that are going to be shared across\nmultiple projects that you wanna save.\n\n78\n00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.380\nSo you can keep it all together.\n\n79\n00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.190\nNow, there's nothing wrong with keeping\none file as a business card and\n\n80\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.730\nkeeping one file as a flier\nif you wanted to do that way.\n\n81\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.660\nIt's really how you wanna organize and\n\n82\n00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.290\nhow kind like your brain thinks,\nif how you wanna approach it.\n\n83\n00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.660\nBut I love art boards.\n\n84\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.570\nThey're really great.\n\n85\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.420\nIt's kind of like a newer,\nif you wanna say, feature.\n\n86\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.350\nSo, coming from a place where I never\nhad multiple art boards in my files.\n\n87\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.840\nIt took me a while to kind of embrace\nthem if you wanna say because\n\n88\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.050\nthat's just the way I always did it.\n\n89\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.900\nBut now it's awesome, so yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.030\n>> Really, great.\n\n91\n00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.160\n>> And we'll talk about like how\nyou actually create an art board,\n\n92\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.970\ncuz you're probably thinking that right\nnow like, well show me how to make one.\n\n93\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.180\nHow do I make multiple art boards?\n\n94\n00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.190\nWell we'll get there when we actually\nstart getting into creating files and\n\n95\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.320\ncreating the items.\n\n96\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.150\nRight now I just wanna identify\nthese things for you so\n\n97\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.965\nyou can kinda know what to look for\nwhen you open up a file.\n\n98\n00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.696\n>> Very good Keep us in suspense.\n\n99\n00:04:27.696 --> 00:04:30.550\n>> Yes,\nexactly [LAUGH] gotta keep you guessing.\n\n100\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.440\nSo, we've talked about\nthis area down here,\n\n101\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.190\nof one way that you can go\nacross your multiple art boards.\n\n102\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.710\nThe other thing is you actually\nhave a panel called art boards.\n\n103\n00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.710\nSo, you can see that from here I've\ngot my 1, 2, 3, and the names and\n\n104\n00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.940\neverything like that.\n\n105\n00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.810\nSo I can click on the names of the art\nboards here in my, whoops, actually,\n\n106\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.367\nsorry, you gotta click the numbers,\nwrong place I was clicking [LAUGH].\n\n107\n00:04:53.367 --> 00:04:57.956\nSo if you click the numbers you can, well\nmaybe, how about we double click [LAUGH]?\n\n108\n00:04:57.956 --> 00:04:58.930\nWell that renames it.\n\n109\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.340\nWow, I'm just all over the place.\n\n110\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.510\nAnyways, you can go ahead and\nclick on these art boards, and\n\n111\n00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.357\nit will take you to the place\nthat you want to go, all right.\n\n112\n00:05:06.357 --> 00:05:09.720\nSo, double clicking on the numbers\nwill take you to the art boards.\n\n113\n00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.163\nThere we go, so double click the numbers.\n\n114\n00:05:11.163 --> 00:05:12.260\n>> Double click the numbers, got it.\n\n115\n00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.409\n>> Yes, don't fumble around like I am.\n\n116\n00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:15.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n117\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.760\n>> All right, so,\n\n118\n00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.710\nthat's one way that you can do this.\n\n119\n00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.640\nI can't do this keyboard shortcut on\nmy Mac because I don't have a page up,\n\n120\n00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.920\npage down butt But if you have a full size\nkeyboard, you can also do Shift+Page Up\n\n121\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.000\nand Shift+Page Down, and that will cycle\nyou thru your different art boards.\n\n122\n00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.548\n>> Very good.\n>> Like when I'm actually designing things\n\n123\n00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:39.390\nat home, even though I have my laptop,\nI plug in a full size Apple keyboard.\n\n124\n00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.151\nBecause I need the number\npad a lot of times.\n\n125\n00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:45.991\nAnd I do use a lot of those keys that\nare not on my Mac ready to go, but\n\n126\n00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:50.215\nalways like to show you those short cuts,\nshift page up,\n\n127\n00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:54.510\nshift page down takes you\nacross all of your art boards.\n\n128\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.510\nSo, I'm gonna go back to art board number\ntwo and kind of take you here because,\n\n129\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.400\nif I wanted to do something with\nthis yellow square or whatever.\n\n130\n00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.450\nWhat tool do you think\nyou should probably have?\n\n131\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.690\n>> I'm going to guess the select\ntool if there is one.\n\n132\n00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.500\n>> There is a select tool.\n\n133\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.650\nYes, that is the tool I'm currently on.\n\n134\n00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.900\nAnd that is up here in the upper right\nhand corner, the selection tool.\n\n135\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.408\nHotkey is v.\n\n136\n00:06:22.408 --> 00:06:24.640\nAnd it's the black arrow tool.\n\n137\n00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.300\nOkay.\n\n138\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.384\nIt's probably the most important tool,\nI think,\n\n139\n00:06:28.384 --> 00:06:31.695\nin Illustrator or\nany product cuz you gotta select it.\n\n140\n00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:33.200\n>> Select to effect, right.\n\n141\n00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.140\n>> Yeah, remember.\n\n142\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.520\nYes, select to effect.\n\n143\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.642\nWe had those rules.\n\n144\n00:06:36.642 --> 00:06:37.525\nWhat were the rules?\n\n145\n00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:39.275\n>> Select to effect.\n\n146\n00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:42.745\nHover to discover,\nwhich we talked about on your tools.\n\n147\n00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:44.625\nAnd then, when in doubt, right click.\n\n148\n00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:46.635\nWe couldn't come up with\na clever rhyme for that one.\n\n149\n00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:48.465\n>> Yeah.\nThere's nothing clever about that.\n\n150\n00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:50.245\nThere's no rhyme to make it fun.\n\n151\n00:06:50.245 --> 00:06:52.072\nBut the same thing applies here.\n\n152\n00:06:52.072 --> 00:06:56.882\nSo we have the hover to discover, to see\nthe tool tips like what is the hotkey for\n\n153\n00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:58.632\nthe selection tool.\n\n154\n00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:00.202\nAnd select to effect.\n\n155\n00:07:00.202 --> 00:07:01.822\nGotta select before I can do anything.\n\n156\n00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:04.326\nSo, I got the black arrow tool and\nthat’s great.\n\n157\n00:07:06.196 --> 00:07:09.706\nBe the watch what the black\narrow tool actually looks like.\n\n158\n00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:14.306\nRemember, the mouse cursor icon is\nprobably the most important thing that\n\n159\n00:07:14.306 --> 00:07:18.068\nyou always need to watch for\nin working in any Adobe product.\n\n160\n00:07:18.068 --> 00:07:22.636\nSo, right now, hang out now in like\nnowhere land if you wanna say like a blank\n\n161\n00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:24.284\narea of this document.\n\n162\n00:07:24.284 --> 00:07:28.430\nIt's just the regular black arrow,\nwith what I call, it has a tail, right?\n\n163\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.810\nIt's got the tail at the end of the arrow.\n\n164\n00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.260\nAnd there's nothing else with it.\n\n165\n00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.370\nIf I just hover,\nnow I'm not clicking anything.\n\n166\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.100\nIf I just hover over this square do you\nsee how there's a dot at the end of it.\n\n167\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.840\nThat's what I call it.\n\n168\n00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.410\nIf you get a dot at the end of the tail,\n\n169\n00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.750\nyou know that you're over\nsomething that can be selected.\n\n170\n00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.310\n>> Okay.\n\n171\n00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.140\n>> Okay, so no dot, dot.\n\n172\n00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.410\nSo, nothing, something.\n\n173\n00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.382\nSo those are the things\nthat you need to watch for.\n\n174\n00:07:53.382 --> 00:07:56.134\nThen the last mouse cursor icon,\n\n175\n00:07:56.134 --> 00:08:01.161\nwhen you're working with\nthe black arrow tool, is No tail.\n\n176\n00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:06.950\nAnd what that means is, when I'm over\nthis I single-click, select this item.\n\n177\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.690\nAnd that's actually a small item, so\nlet me click over here, so there we go.\n\n178\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.355\nI'm trying to get it where it\ndoesn't have any other icons.\n\n179\n00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:14.321\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n180\n00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:15.825\n>> So you can see that it's missing\n\n181\n00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:16.620\nits tail.\n\n182\n00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.330\nIf there's no tail, you're over something\nthat is selected and you can move it.\n\n183\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.378\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay, so you don't get four point\n\n184\n00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:26.510\narrows, or anything like that\nlike you do in Photoshop,\n\n185\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.400\nyou actually have the move tool.\n\n186\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.619\nThis is the move tool, if you wanna say.\n\n187\n00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:32.856\nSo you can watch that.\n\n188\n00:08:32.856 --> 00:08:36.140\nSo this particular thing, let me zoom in\na little bit so you can kind of see that.\n\n189\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.120\nSo there's a lot of different things that,\nwhen you hover,\n\n190\n00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.630\nyou get a lot of different icons.\n\n191\n00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.170\nWe'll go over each one of those\nindividually, when we start doing some\n\n192\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:49.050\nmajor modifying of items,\nbecause we're just selecting them.\n\n193\n00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:55.740\nIf you select something, the other biggest\nthing to me is always deselecting.\n\n194\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.060\n>> Yeah, how do I unselect it?\n\n195\n00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.545\nI didn't mean to select it, or\nI wanna select something else now.\n\n196\n00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:02.790\n>> Mm-hm, it's that you gotta click off,\nyou just click on and off.\n\n197\n00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.850\nYou just click in some blank area,\ndon't have a dot at the end of the tail.\n\n198\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.880\nIf I just click off into a blank area,\n\n199\n00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.410\nthen I have deselected anything,\nand then I'm good to go.\n\n200\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.230\nSo always click off, always make\nsure I'm done with that thought, or\n\n201\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.220\naction, or whatever you wanna say.\n\n202\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.110\nAnd that's it, so.\n\n203\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.590\n>> Click away from the item\nyou have selected.\n\n204\n00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.420\n>> Exactly, so very basic stuff, but\nalways watch those mouse cursor icons.\n\n205\n00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.780\nSo now we've done a basic selection of our\nyellow square, we know what to look for\n\n206\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.250\nwith our mouse cursor icons.\n\n207\n00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.290\nSo we've got that out of the way,\n\n208\n00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.470\nlet's start exploring the different items\nwhen we're just hovering over things.\n\n209\n00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.562\nSo we know how we just single click it\nto select it, so what are we looking at?\n\n210\n00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:47.630\nAll right, when I hover over things,\nyou're going to start to see all sorts\n\n211\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.220\nof different things on your screen\nwhen you're hovering over things.\n\n212\n00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:57.030\nLike, I can see a little blue outline\nalmost, of that yellow square.\n\n213\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.140\nIf I hover over the text,\nits got a little line underneath it.\n\n214\n00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.168\nSo there's different things here.\n\n215\n00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:07.240\nAnd, let me come over here.\n\n216\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.950\nI'm using my toggle of\nholding my space bar.\n\n217\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.110\n>> I remember that one.\n\n218\n00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.780\n>> Do my move.\n\n219\n00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.980\nOkay, so you can see that I've got some\ndifferent things hovering around and\n\n220\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.460\nif I had a much more complicated file, I\ncould actually show you some other things.\n\n221\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.310\nOkay let me just do that really quick,\nlet me open up another file.\n\n222\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.285\nRemember this gem?\n\n223\n00:10:24.285 --> 00:10:25.130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n224\n00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.200\n>> Yeah, so\non this one you can see a lot more.\n\n225\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.740\nYou see when I hover\nover the white flowers,\n\n226\n00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.052\nsee this is what I wanted to show you, you\ncan see a lot of the pink outlines, right?\n\n227\n00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:36.630\nYeah?\n\n228\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.030\nSo if I hover over here.\n\n229\n00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.320\n>> Can you zoom in any closer?\n\n230\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:39.890\n>> Yeah.\nOver here?\n\n231\n00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.380\n>> Yeah, we wanna see it.\n\n232\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.140\nThat's good.\n>> There we go.\n\n233\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.040\nSee there's the pink.\n\n234\n00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.100\nYeah I guess it's kinda hard to see the\npink on the pink background, can't you?\n\n235\n00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.260\nWell one thing I did wanna note, is back\non this particular file, you see when I\n\n236\n00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.495\nwas hovering over something like this,\nthat's kind of a hard one to show you.\n\n237\n00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:57.280\n[LAUGH] Hey, let's go over here.\n\n238\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.350\nLets go to this one.\n\n239\n00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.480\nSee?\nThat's blue, right?\n\n240\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.430\nThis one's blue, but the white flower is\npink, so what does that color indicate?\n\n241\n00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.830\nWell, that color indicates\nwhat layer that item is on.\n\n242\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.830\nAnd each layer has a color\ncoding if you wanna say.\n\n243\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.750\nSo in here, if I single click on this,\nit's pink, if I come over to my layers\n\n244\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.740\nyou can see that this particular item\nis on a layer called white flowers.\n\n245\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.830\nI actually did a pretty good job of\nnaming my layers in this file for\n\n246\n00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:30.920\nthis particular purpose.\n\n247\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.550\nAnd you can see right there,\nsee that little pink?\n\n248\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.350\nThat indicates the color of the layer.\n\n249\n00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.110\nSo there's blue, there's yellow, there's\ngreen, and all sorts of things like that.\n\n250\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.340\n>> So you can tell what layer an object\nis on, just by selecting it and\n\n251\n00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.796\nseeing what color the outline is?\n\n252\n00:11:43.796 --> 00:11:44.645\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n253\n00:11:44.645 --> 00:11:45.213\n>> Nice.\n\n254\n00:11:45.213 --> 00:11:49.600\n>> Yep, and we'll go over a lot more\nwith layers and how we create them.\n\n255\n00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.080\nJust like how we're creating art boards.\n\n256\n00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.080\nAgain, we're just doing identifying.\n\n257\n00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.190\nAnd over here, [LAUGH] I didn't do\na very good job of naming these layers,\n\n258\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.640\nlayer one, layer two.\n\n259\n00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.910\nNot very descriptive.\n\n260\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.550\nHaving descriptive files of your layers\nwill probably help a little bit.\n\n261\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.990\nBut you can see that I've got the blue and\nthe red.\n\n262\n00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.620\nMost of this stuff is going\nto be on the layer one, and\n\n263\n00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.500\nyou can even see in tiny\nthumbnail that there's a lot.\n\n264\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.100\nYou can almost see the three art boards\nit's really hard to see on this one\n\n265\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.380\nprobably but that's what you got going on.\n\n266\n00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.590\nSo that's colors ff the hovering\nwhen you're on an item.\n\n267\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.170\n>> Okay.\n\n268\n00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.280\n>> 'Cuz that's the layer that it's on.\n\n269\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.760\nSo we know what layer\nthings are on by the color.\n\n270\n00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.590\nSo if I do some simple selections and\neverything.\n\n271\n00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.420\nSo I've selected this pink square.\n\n272\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.380\nAnd let me zoom in so\nyou can see it a little bit better.\n\n273\n00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.190\nSo I've selected this pink square.\n\n274\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.330\nSo I can go ahead.\n\n275\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:45.830\nAnd if I wanted to do something with this,\nmove it, whatever.\n\n276\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:50.540\nI can do that obviously, I can move it, I\ncan change it's color, and this is where I\n\n277\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.860\nwanted to point out that when you actually\nhave something selected on your art board,\n\n278\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.130\nor anywhere in Illustrator that\nyou should always look up here.\n\n279\n00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.230\nSo this is an area we haven't really\ntalked about is this big old bar\n\n280\n00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.500\nacross the top.\n\n281\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.250\nThis is known as the control panel, okay?\n\n282\n00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:10.780\nAnd so this is going to tell you\nwhat this item is, so always look in\n\n283\n00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.820\nthe upper left hand corner,\nhere to say well, what am I selected on?\n\n284\n00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.380\nThis is a rectangle and\nit actually tells me that.\n\n285\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:26.470\nIf I click on this circle right\nhere then that says its an ellipse.\n\n286\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.210\nAnd if I'm clicked on it,\nit says its a picture.\n\n287\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.090\nSo that's another big indication,\nwhat am I on?\n\n288\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.670\nWhat am I working with?\n\n289\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.380\nMm.\n>> And just something to notice.\n\n290\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.350\nSo if I have this purple circle selected.\n\n291\n00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.215\nI think we started with the square, but\nnow we've changed over to the circle.\n\n292\n00:13:43.215 --> 00:13:44.070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n293\n00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.490\n>> So this ellipse,\nit shows me that it has a\n\n294\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:51.500\n>> Purple fill and a black stroke.\n\n295\n00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.120\nRemember, insides and outsides.\n\n296\n00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.850\nWhoops sorry.\n\n297\n00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.270\nI kind of moved that around, didn't I?\n\n298\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:55.790\nOkay, there we go.\n\n299\n00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.880\nSo there's the fill and\nthere's the stroke.\n\n300\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.980\nAnd you can see it cross all the way.\n\n301\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.330\nIt's got a five point stroke, it doesn't\nhave a specific brush or an opacity.\n\n302\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.060\nBut you can change a lot of the different\n\n303\n00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.590\nproperties of the items\nwithin the control panel.\n\n304\n00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.150\nSo, you don't always have to go to\nthe different panels and everything,\n\n305\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.410\nyou can just access everything from there.\n\n306\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.910\nAnd since I didn't mention panels,\n\n307\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.150\nI wanted to show you that\nin this control panel,\n\n308\n00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.550\nthere are some of the Titles, I guess\nwe'll say, of this particular option.\n\n309\n00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.340\nThey're orange and underlined.\n\n310\n00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.910\nThat means that if you click on that,\nit actually pops up with more\n\n311\n00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:42.270\noptions than just the stroke weight\nin this little drop-down right here,\n\n312\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.480\nit shows you all the different\nthings that are in here.\n\n313\n00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.920\nAnd it actually mirrors all of\nthe items you have in your stroke.\n\n314\n00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.470\nWhoops, there you go.\n\n315\n00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.410\nDouble click in your panel.\n\n316\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.220\nSo instead of me going all the way over\nto my panel and changing the different\n\n317\n00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.910\noptions of the stroke, I can actually\njust shortcut if you want to say.\n\n318\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.320\nRight here within the control panel and\ndo all the things I need to do with it.\n\n319\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.870\n>> Nice, I can see where that\nwould be real convenient.\n\n320\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.660\n>> Yes, yeah.\n\n321\n00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.960\nI work a lot across the control panel,\n\n322\n00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.200\ncuz a lot of the things that\nI need are right there.\n\n323\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.970\nSo the transform actually that's a panel,\nthe opacity that's a specific panel,\n\n324\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.210\nbut I can just access\nthe stuff right there for you.\n\n325\n00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.530\nSo control panel super handy,\ngets you everything you need to do.\n\n326\n00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.530\nSo, for this one,\nwe got our purple circle.\n\n327\n00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.820\nPurple circle?\n\n328\n00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.910\n>> I like that.\n>> Yeah,\n\n329\n00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.495\nwe should probably change the color, so\nI can actually get that out of my mouth.\n\n330\n00:15:34.495 --> 00:15:36.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you can see there's a little drop\n\n331\n00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.240\ndown, a little triangle\nnext to the fill color.\n\n332\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.700\nWhere I can take this down,\nit's gonna show me a bunch of swatches.\n\n333\n00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.490\nI can say,\nall right let's not make it purple.\n\n334\n00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.684\nLet's make it blue.\n\n335\n00:15:48.684 --> 00:15:50.490\nOkay, so now I have a blue circle.\n\n336\n00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.367\nBut I want more colors,\nwe'll get to that too.\n\n337\n00:15:55.367 --> 00:15:59.804\nAnd if I wanna change the color of the\nstroke then I can just come over here and\n\n338\n00:15:59.804 --> 00:16:03.484\nmaybe I'll make a yellow,\nit's not a very good color to see.\n\n339\n00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:06.457\nSo maybe we'll make a red\nstroke color there.\n\n340\n00:16:06.457 --> 00:16:08.025\nAnd you can go across the board and\n\n341\n00:16:08.025 --> 00:16:11.920\nstart changing all the different things\nthat you want to with the stroke.\n\n342\n00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.030\nThe brushes and the width profiles and\nthings like that.\n\n343\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.540\n>> Very good.\nSo\n\n344\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.870\na lot of the more commonly\ndone properties that we modify\n\n345\n00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.190\non a shaper right there\non our control panel.\n\n346\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.550\nSaves us from having to go to the panels,\n\n347\n00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.870\nmaybe we got those collapsed\nup to give us more work space.\n\n348\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.070\nVery convenient,\ndoesn't matter which way I do it.\n\n349\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.990\nI'm still effecting the same,\nthere's only one stroke, one fill.\n\n350\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.080\nWhether I do it in the control panel or\ndo it in panel.\n\n351\n00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.984\nOr use the toolbar down the side.\n\n352\n00:16:36.984 --> 00:16:39.850\nWell, you actually just brought\nup a really good point of like,\n\n353\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:40.820\nwell there's only one fill.\n\n354\n00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.360\nThere's only one stroke and\nI wanted to say, well no, not really.\n\n355\n00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.930\nYou can have multiple strokes and\nmultiple fills that gets and who knows.\n\n356\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.080\nAnd again, all that suspense of\nlike where is that coming at.\n\n357\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.250\nSo that's when we get into.\n\n358\n00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.520\n>> Well hold that thought,\nwe'll come back to it.\n\n359\n00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.260\n>> Yeah, when we get into our appearance\npad and we can have multiple strokes.\n\n360\n00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.970\nBut for now, in this episode,\nyes, there's just one.\n\n361\n00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:00.910\nYeah, okay.\n>> Fill in one stroke.\n\n362\n00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.290\nSo that's what we've-\n>> And it doesn't matter where I change it\n\n363\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.930\nas far as-\n>> Correct.\n\n364\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.340\nYes.\nYou can change it in the panel.\n\n365\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.810\nSo for example.\n\n366\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.615\nThat's a really good point\nthat you brought up.\n\n367\n00:17:09.615 --> 00:17:10.850\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Cuz that's something\n\n368\n00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.400\nthat we cover right here,\nis that with this circle.\n\n369\n00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:19.340\n>> Right here, I went ahead and\nchange it up here but in the toolbox.\n\n370\n00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.530\nYes, tools, the tools over here,\nyou see these two guys right here.\n\n371\n00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:28.040\nOkay, that's where and if you're a\nPhotoshop user you probably used to kinda\n\n372\n00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.710\nseeing that you've got the fill\n>> And the stroke.\n\n373\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.450\nAnd you see how, right now,\nthe corner of this top guy,\n\n374\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.370\nif you want to say, is on top.\n\n375\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.560\nWhat I mean by that is let\nme show you this once.\n\n376\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.440\nSee if I click there?\n\n377\n00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.720\nYou see how now the red is like,\non top of that?\n\n378\n00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.220\n>> It's overlapping the blue.\n\n379\n00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.570\n>> Exactly.\nAnd that's going to indicate to you what\n\n380\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:57.420\npart of the item you are affecting\nif you go to the swatches panel.\n\n381\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.580\nYeah, up here it's like,\nokay there's the fill in the stroke.\n\n382\n00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:05.688\nHere, it's like, all right, whatever\nbox is on top if you wanna say,.That's\n\n383\n00:18:05.688 --> 00:18:10.190\ngoing to determine if I go into\nthe swatches, let's go here.\n\n384\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.720\nI mean, collapse that so\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n385\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.910\nSo if I click on the purple,\n\n386\n00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:20.990\nyou see how it's changing the fill of\nthat circle or if I go to yellow or to.\n\n387\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.440\nThere's also really cool things\nwith the patterns and gradients,\n\n388\n00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.510\nand everything like that.\n\n389\n00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.510\nAnd so that's where you can change.\n\n390\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.600\nBut if I come over here.\n\n391\n00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.370\nIt's, like, well, now I want to go ahead\nand change the color of the stroke.\n\n392\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:32.660\nI want to make the stroke green.\n\n393\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.320\nSo if you're going ahead,\nand just start, like.\n\n394\n00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.480\nWell, this will make it green.\n\n395\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.090\nWait, why hasn't that changed?\n\n396\n00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.940\nWell, that's because I need to.\n\n397\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:46.570\nBut, the stroke box on top and then I can\ngo ahead and change it from the switches.\n\n398\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.390\nBut you see right there I mean I've gone\nfrom one side of the screen to the other\n\n399\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.410\nside of the screen and change and that.\n\n400\n00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.220\nSo it's me and the control panel\njust makes it so much easier.\n\n401\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.080\nIt's a kind of like a one stop shop.\n\n402\n00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.950\nIt doesn't always fulfill all your\nneeds because sometimes you need\n\n403\n00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.700\nmore than just the basic stuff.\n\n404\n00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.000\nSo you do have the panels and\n\n405\n00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.310\nthings like that that can go into\nmore of your options for you.\n\n406\n00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.650\nSo let's move on.\n\n407\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.120\nRight here, if I've got a green stroke and\na purple fill,\n\n408\n00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.390\nbut I didn't want to do that.\n\n409\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.986\nUndo.\nWhat do we do?\n\n410\n00:19:17.986 --> 00:19:19.290\n>> Ctrl+Z.\n\n411\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.606\n>> Ctrl+Z.\n\n412\n00:19:20.606 --> 00:19:24.880\nYes, and if it's not a keyboard shortcut,\nyou can always go to the edit menu.\n\n413\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.300\nSo, you have edit and you can see,\nof course, undo swatch.\n\n414\n00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.640\nApply swatch,\ncuz that was the last thing we did.\n\n415\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.380\nSo let me go ahead and undo that,\nControl-Z, and then maybe do it again.\n\n416\n00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.240\nYou can see I can keep on going back and\nkeep on going back and\n\n417\n00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.232\nkeep on going back, right?\n\n418\n00:19:39.232 --> 00:19:43.138\nWait, no, I didn't wanna go that far back,\nI wanna go forward.\n\n419\n00:19:43.138 --> 00:19:44.119\nDo you remember what\n\n420\n00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:45.966\nthe keyboard shortcut for-\n>> Control-Y.\n\n421\n00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:47.990\n>> Control-Y, and where do we do that?\n\n422\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.450\n>> In most of my applications,\nI do it a lot in Office.\n\n423\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.200\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n424\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.910\nSo the keyboard shortcut for\nredo In offices why,\n\n425\n00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.300\nI just repeated what you just said.\n\n426\n00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.790\nBut I just wanted to point out,\n\n427\n00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:05.000\nthat if you try to do that in Illustrator,\nyou're gonna get this.\n\n428\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.310\n>> Yeah, well, yeah, and\nthat's what a lot of people say.\n\n429\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.130\nWhat happened?\n\n430\n00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.490\n>> What did I just do?\n\n431\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.040\n>> Yes, well,\nthen they come up here and they try and\n\n432\n00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.796\nchange the color, and it's like,\nnothing's changing, what's going on?\n\n433\n00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:18.840\nThat's because CTRL+Y n Adobe products,\n\n434\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.710\nspecifically this one,\nis showing an outlines.\n\n435\n00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.510\nBecause remember we're\ntalking about vectors.\n\n436\n00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.845\nWe're talking about vector paths.\n\n437\n00:20:26.845 --> 00:20:32.480\nAnd the fills and are just\nthe attributes of that particular path.\n\n438\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.050\nBut, it's still just a path.\n\n439\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.710\n>> So this is stripping out all the pretty\nstuff that we might add to that path,\n\n440\n00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.180\nthis is showing you just the raw paths.\n\n441\n00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.980\n>> Just the paths,\nwhich can be very handy,\n\n442\n00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.910\nI work in this view a decent amount.\n\n443\n00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:48.380\nNot all the time, but it does help\nespecially with really complex\n\n444\n00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.530\ndrawings that you just need to see\nthe wire frames, or the outlines of this.\n\n445\n00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.860\nThat's what this is, and\nthis is in the view menu by the way.\n\n446\n00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.160\nSo if I go to View, there it is.\n\n447\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.000\nNow, it says preview because\nI'm in Outline views.\n\n448\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.400\nSo if I do control y again.\n\n449\n00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.490\nYou can see, now my view says Outline.\n\n450\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:09.200\nSo, that will throw people off if you're\na keyboard shortcut person from Office.\n\n451\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.070\n>> Yes, cuz I would do the control y,\nhave goofed things up and\n\n452\n00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.990\nthen try to do control z a couple\ntimes to get back and it.\n\n453\n00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.095\nWouldn't help me because that's not\ngonna change it from Preview to Outline.\n\n454\n00:21:19.095 --> 00:21:20.110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n455\n00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:20.680\nYeah.\n>> Wow.\n\n456\n00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:28.780\n>> So the keyboard shortcut for Redo in\nAdobe products is Ctrl + Shift + Z, okay?\n\n457\n00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.200\nSo, you can see right there\nthe Redo is Ctrl + Shift + Z.\n\n458\n00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.840\nSo, it's like Undo is Ctrl + Z.\n\n459\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:41.607\nRedo or go forward you wanna say is\nCtrl+Cmd+Shift and I can move forward.\n\n460\n00:21:41.607 --> 00:21:42.621\n>> Nice.\n>> Exactly.\n\n461\n00:21:42.621 --> 00:21:44.414\n>> Very important to know.\n\n462\n00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:46.560\n>> It is very important.\n\n463\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.930\nSo if we're going over selecting\nthings that's, always the left mouse.\n\n464\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.740\nRemember we always have to clarify it.\n\n465\n00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.905\nI didn't actually say that but\nI should probably.\n\n466\n00:21:55.905 --> 00:21:57.700\n>> Left-click, normal click, maybe?\n\n467\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.870\nNo, probably not, left-click.\n\n468\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.375\n>> Well I'm left handed so\nit's definitely normal.\n\n469\n00:22:02.375 --> 00:22:06.305\n[LAUGH] But then the other\nthing is you're right-clicking.\n\n470\n00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:08.580\nBecause right-click What did we say?\n\n471\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.550\nWhen in doubt, right click.\n\n472\n00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.440\nGives you your options.\n\n473\n00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.480\nSo you can select something first,\nthen right click on it.\n\n474\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.820\nSo, I just want to\ndemonstrate that if I'm not,\n\n475\n00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.190\nI don't have anything selected\ncuz I'm off over here.\n\n476\n00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.120\nI've clicked off.\n\n477\n00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.320\nIf I right click right now,\n\n478\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.600\nit's going to show me a specific\ncontextual menu of whatever I'm on.\n\n479\n00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.880\nAnd, you see things like lock guides,\nhide guides.\n\n480\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.790\nBut, if I click on a square,\nand then right click.\n\n481\n00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.430\nYou see how I have a lot of different\nthings, like arrange and transform.\n\n482\n00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.100\nSo, if you're right clicking on something.\n\n483\n00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.440\nMake sure that you have\nthe item selected first.\n\n484\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.520\nFor example, if I go here, if I select the\ntext and right-click on that you see how I\n\n485\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.700\nhave font and things associated\nwith formatting the text.\n\n486\n00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.520\nBut If I wasn't paying attention and\nI'm like, well, let me go ahead and\n\n487\n00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.310\nright click here.\n\n488\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.350\nAnd I'm like wait, why is that on fonts?\n\n489\n00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.100\nWhy is that on fonts?\n\n490\n00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.300\nIt's because you still have that selected.\n\n491\n00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.520\nYeah, so that's the whole like, click\noff of it, make sure you're on the item,\n\n492\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.410\nthen right click.\n\n493\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.799\nSo, it can start to get.\n\n494\n00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.460\nYou can almost get a little lost.\n\n495\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.360\nI still do it,\nafter all these years [INAUDIBLE].\n\n496\n00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:24.567\nIts something I just wanted to pull up for\nyou guys.\n\n497\n00:23:24.567 --> 00:23:30.310\nSo, I can select a single item, but\nwhat if I want to select multiple items?\n\n498\n00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.060\nI want both of these squares\nselected because I want to\n\n499\n00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.255\nchange both of their colors or\nsomething like that.\n\n500\n00:23:35.255 --> 00:23:38.000\nSingle-click to select one.\n\n501\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.980\nYou can hold your shift key\nto select multiple items.\n\n502\n00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.520\nSo if I would single-click on this,\nnow I've selected that.\n\n503\n00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.230\nI can keep holding that shift key and\nthen I can click over here.\n\n504\n00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.760\nAnd you see how it kinda\nmakes a bounding box across\n\n505\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.400\nall of the items that you have selected.\n\n506\n00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.911\nSo, shift click, and\nI can get all of these.\n\n507\n00:23:53.911 --> 00:23:58.174\nIt says there's a question\nmark in there because there\n\n508\n00:23:58.174 --> 00:24:02.073\nare multiple fill colors\nthat you've selected.\n\n509\n00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:05.974\nI just want to show you that\nmaybe I want them all orange or\n\n510\n00:24:05.974 --> 00:24:09.377\nsomething like that So\nI can go ahead and do that,\n\n511\n00:24:09.377 --> 00:24:14.370\nI did Cmd+Z to undo, click off to\ndeselect, Shift+click to go here.\n\n512\n00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:18.170\nBut then maybe it's like I didn't want\nthat pink one, I selected too many.\n\n513\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.900\nJust keep holding that Shift key,\nand if Shift+click on that again it\n\n514\n00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.600\ntakes it out of the selecting of\nthe multiple items that you want.\n\n515\n00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.690\nOkay, so that's always good.\n\n516\n00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:34.960\nAnother thing that you can do to select,\nsay these three squares right here, is you\n\n517\n00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.740\nmake a I call it a selection marquee, if I\nsay it, still have the blank arrow tool.\n\n518\n00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:44.210\nAnd if I just click, hold,\nand drag, and see as long as\n\n519\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:50.110\nthe the selection marquee\njust like touches the pieces.\n\n520\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:54.270\nSee I am not fully around the purple\nsquare, I'm just like that.\n\n521\n00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.460\nAs long as its touching and\n\n522\n00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.420\nlet go it selects all of those items\n>> That was my question because I know\n\n523\n00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.900\nsome programs you have to get all\nthe way around the shape to select it,\n\n524\n00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.589\nothers you get just a little bit\nof it in that selection marquee,\n\n525\n00:25:04.589 --> 00:25:05.976\nand it's gonna include it.\n\n526\n00:25:05.976 --> 00:25:09.430\nAnd that can get you in\ntrouble sometimes in a crowded\n\n527\n00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:13.010\ndocument with lots of items on it,\nit can be really hard to select that way.\n\n528\n00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.540\n>> Definitely, so you can yeah, so\nyou can just click, hold, and drag.\n\n529\n00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.980\nAnd I do this all the time.\n\n530\n00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.020\nJust okay,\nI want all these guys right here.\n\n531\n00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.520\nCuz I wanna move them over there.\n\n532\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.050\nOr I wanna kinda go like this and\nthen move these guys.\n\n533\n00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.610\nYou can see right here while I'm\nmoving I should probably point out,\n\n534\n00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.700\nyou see all these little pink\nlines going all over the place?\n\n535\n00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.530\nThey're crazy.\n\n536\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.590\nThey're awesome.\nThese are smart guides.\n\n537\n00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.180\nOkay, so what's going on when I do this?\n\n538\n00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.740\nIt's separating the spaces and\nthen this is aligning with this.\n\n539\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.872\nThey can get a little overwhelming cuz\nit's like [SOUND], it's spazzing out and\n\n540\n00:25:44.872 --> 00:25:45.443\neverything.\n\n541\n00:25:45.443 --> 00:25:50.570\nBut it does help you when you\nstart getting into aligning.\n\n542\n00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.340\nLike this right here,\nif I kinda, I know that the tops\n\n543\n00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:58.910\nof these squares are going to be aligned\nbecause the smart guides have done that,\n\n544\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.900\nI don't have to actually\nhave to do a lined command.\n\n545\n00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.580\n>> Very convenient.\n\n546\n00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.057\n>> Very great so that's what you're\nseeing when we're going through\n\n547\n00:26:06.057 --> 00:26:09.046\nall of those pink stuff that's\ngoing all over the place and\n\n548\n00:26:09.046 --> 00:26:11.744\nif you wanna know where that\nis it is in the view menu.\n\n549\n00:26:11.744 --> 00:26:13.183\n>> So we turn it off?\n>> And you can see that smart, yeah.\n\n550\n00:26:13.183 --> 00:26:14.940\nAnd right there actually the command.\n\n551\n00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:20.068\nIt is Cmd+U, so if you did that and\nthen where are all my cool little helper\n\n552\n00:26:20.068 --> 00:26:24.720\nthings, where are all my smart guys,\nit might have turned it off.\n\n553\n00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.911\nOkay, so the View menu is a good place to\nstart at least getting familiar with those\n\n554\n00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:30.997\nlittle things that sometimes can hide.\n\n555\n00:26:30.997 --> 00:26:33.845\nWhile I'm over hiding,\nthis Hide Edge thing,\n\n556\n00:26:33.845 --> 00:26:38.826\nthat can get you sometimes to where if I'm\nhere, and I selected these two squares,\n\n557\n00:26:38.826 --> 00:26:42.800\nI know that there's that kind of-\n>> Bounding box?\n\n558\n00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.860\n>> Yeah, it's showing me that these\nare the things that are selected, so\n\n559\n00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.360\nI've got all of these items.\n\n560\n00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.060\nIf you go to that View and\nyou go to Hide Edges, see,\n\n561\n00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.580\nit actually, it shows the big box,\nbut doesn't show the individual\n\n562\n00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.100\nedges that those are the things that are,\nit can throw you off.\n\n563\n00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.500\nSo it's-\n>> Now you're not sure if that yellow box\n\n564\n00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.150\nthere is part of the selection or not.\n\n565\n00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.800\nIt's inside the outer bounding box, but\nit might not be part of your selection.\n\n566\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.400\n>> Yeah, and\nit's thrown me off from time to time.\n\n567\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.290\nSo I figure since I'm in this View menu\nI'll go ahead and throw that in for\n\n568\n00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.590\nyou too, so.\n\n569\n00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.830\nWe thank you for that\n>> You're welcome [LAUGH].\n\n570\n00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.426\nSo I we know how to select multiple\nitems I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n571\n00:27:18.426 --> 00:27:20.810\nswitch over to my art board here.\n\n572\n00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:22.650\nWe talk about the control panel right?\n\n573\n00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.775\nAnd that's going to indicate\nto you what you’re on and\n\n574\n00:27:25.775 --> 00:27:29.780\nwhat you're working with and\nI wanted to show you this.\n\n575\n00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.170\nRight here with these three,\nthose aren't squares, those are circles.\n\n576\n00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:37.290\nThese three circles right here,\nthey're all selected, but\n\n577\n00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.540\nI single-clicked on just this top one,\nright?\n\n578\n00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.270\nSo why did it give me all of them?\n\n579\n00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.410\nWell, this is a group.\n\n580\n00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.790\nI know it's a group, again,\nbecause I made this, but\n\n581\n00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.890\nup here it just says ellipse, doesn't it?\n\n582\n00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.680\nBut how is that one\ndifferent than that one?\n\n583\n00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.860\nSee, that one says group, right?\n\n584\n00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.250\nHere let me pull that up so\nyou can see it.\n\n585\n00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:59.270\nThat says group, but\nthis one says ellipse.\n\n586\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:05.300\nI find this a little distracting because\nbefore it was always a group is a group.\n\n587\n00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.948\nIt doesn't matter if it was circles or\nsquares or what have you.\n\n588\n00:28:07.948 --> 00:28:12.521\nBut I've just noticed that's what they\ndo now if it's something I created with\n\n589\n00:28:12.521 --> 00:28:15.316\na shape tool,\neven if it's grouped, it names,\n\n590\n00:28:15.316 --> 00:28:19.920\nup there in the control panel the shape or\nthe tool that it was made from.\n\n591\n00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.670\nSo I thought that was a little weird.\n\n592\n00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.950\n>> That's good to know for sure.\n\n593\n00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.620\n>> Yeah, so\nthat's something with the groups.\n\n594\n00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.860\nWhy am I pulling that out?\n\n595\n00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.032\nBecause single-clicking, right?\n\n596\n00:28:30.032 --> 00:28:33.040\nYou single-click to get on something,\nI want just this item.\n\n597\n00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:39.110\nI want the group but if you start\ndouble-clicking on things it takes\n\n598\n00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:42.200\nyou somewhere where you probably don't\nknow where you're going unless I tell you.\n\n599\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.950\nAll right so, it's not isolation mode.\n\n600\n00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:50.130\nif I'm like in this group, we know\nit's a group I'll stay on this one.\n\n601\n00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:56.700\nSo here's my group, if I wanted to change\njust the color of this pink square, right.\n\n602\n00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.990\nBut I didn't want to ungroup it.\n\n603\n00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.160\nBecause you can always ungroup it.\n\n604\n00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.810\nDo what you need to do.\n\n605\n00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.011\nSelect it back together and\ngroup it back together.\n\n606\n00:29:01.011 --> 00:29:01.670\nBut that's too many steps.\n\n607\n00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:02.506\n>> It is.\n>> Right?\n\n608\n00:29:02.506 --> 00:29:03.283\nAnd I said that really fast.\n[LAUGH]\n\n609\n00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:04.752\n>> Especially if it's a complex group with\n\n610\n00:29:04.752 --> 00:29:05.491\na lot of items in it.\n\n611\n00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:08.120\nI don't wanna have to select them\nall again and group them up.\n\n612\n00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.190\n>> Yeah, just keep it as a group but\nI want to edit one thing in particular.\n\n613\n00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:16.530\nIf you double-click,\nto notice two things happen.\n\n614\n00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.240\nThis little guy across the top,\n\n615\n00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.960\nthis comes up to let you know\nthat you are isolation mode.\n\n616\n00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.040\nAnd the other thing,\n\n617\n00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.670\nlet me zoom out, everything else\non the outboard gets dimmed down.\n\n618\n00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:34.220\nSo it's like I'm only on this,\nso I'm inside this group, okay?\n\n619\n00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.900\nNow let me zoom in a little bit more.\n\n620\n00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.000\nSo if I single-click here, see now\nI can single-click on that one item\n\n621\n00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.930\nwithin that group and\nmaybe change it to blue or something.\n\n622\n00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:47.400\nIf I single-click on this guy,\nwell there's another group.\n\n623\n00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.290\nSo I mean you can have a group inside of a\ngroup inside of a group inside of a group.\n\n624\n00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.270\nIt really just depends on\nhow you want to organize it.\n\n625\n00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:56.530\nBut if I double-click one more time\nbecause I'm on a group, if I double-click,\n\n626\n00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:01.950\nnow I'm in a group which is in a group,\nwhich is in Layer 1, okay?\n\n627\n00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.040\nSo it's like a drill-down.\n\n628\n00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.580\n>> Or kinda like a breadcrumb trail or\nsomething.\n\n629\n00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.540\n>> Yeah, breadcrumbs, there you go,\nthat's a good example [LAUGH].\n\n630\n00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:14.350\nSo I'm down in here, so I'm in there, and\nI can change this one or what have you.\n\n631\n00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.360\nIf I want to get out of\nisolation mode altogether,\n\n632\n00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.210\nif I double-click off to the side, right?\n\n633\n00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.090\nRemember?\n\n634\n00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.540\nOr actually, yeah,\ndouble-click cuz we're in isolation mode.\n\n635\n00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.360\nIf I double-click it takes\nme all the way out, okay?\n\n636\n00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.520\nReally quickly, last little part.\n\n637\n00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.500\nIf I'm inside my group you\ncan also go up one level or\n\n638\n00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.350\nkind of go back up your levels.\n\n639\n00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.940\nIf you click back on your breadcrumbs,\n\n640\n00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:39.030\nlike I wanna just go back up to where\nI'm inside the group but where I can\n\n641\n00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.870\nedit this bottom square because I wanna\nmake that purple or something like that.\n\n642\n00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.180\nSo now I can be one level up,\n\n643\n00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.440\ninstead of completely coming all\nthe way out of it by double-clicking.\n\n644\n00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.289\nSo these little guys kinda let you\nknow how you can navigate inside\n\n645\n00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.110\na group within isolation mode.\n\n646\n00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.610\nAnd one last thing,\n\n647\n00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:01.090\nis that you can actually go into isolation\nmode without it being in a group.\n\n648\n00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:05.070\nLike, this is in a group, right,\nthis is just straight up ellipse.\n\n649\n00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.630\nAnd it's red because it's\nin a different layer.\n\n650\n00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.430\nAnd, if I double-click on this,\nthat's another thing\n\n651\n00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.710\nthat throws people off is they\nstart double-clicking on things.\n\n652\n00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.010\nI'm like why did everything dim down?\n\n653\n00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.060\nWhy am I in this place?\n\n654\n00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.660\nWhere am I?\n\n655\n00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.885\nIt always takes you to isolation mode but\nit's only one piece.\n\n656\n00:31:20.885 --> 00:31:23.700\n>> Is there a reason to go\ninto isolation mode like that?\n\n657\n00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.990\nWhat is it preventing?\n\n658\n00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:30.260\n>> Well, it's preventing you from\nediting anything else around it.\n\n659\n00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.180\nSo, say you have just like a whole bunch\nof circles, like really complex artwork\n\n660\n00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.590\nthat's all these different pieces, and\nyou just want to change one part of it.\n\n661\n00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.490\nEven though it's not in a group,\nif you just double-click it,\n\n662\n00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:45.370\nyou're not gonna, see, if I come over\nhere, I can't select any of this stuff.\n\n663\n00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:50.540\nNothing else is selected so\nI only want to work on you, just you.\n\n664\n00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:53.530\nDo something then I can\ndouble-click get out of it.\n\n665\n00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.160\nSo it doesn't have to be in a group,\n\n666\n00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.480\nit's just I want to just\nisolate you by yourself.\n\n667\n00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.710\n>> So I don't accidentally select any\nother shapes or modify anything else,\n\n668\n00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:01.920\njust that one I'm working on.\n\n669\n00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.598\n>> Yup.\n>> Fantastic.\n\n670\n00:32:03.598 --> 00:32:04.190\nAll right, Vonne,\n\n671\n00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:08.260\na lot of great information on how we can\ngo about selecting items in Illustrator.\n\n672\n00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.940\nThere's a lot more to it than\nwhat we might of thought, right?\n\n673\n00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.810\nThere's a lot of different tricks.\n\n674\n00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:17.431\n[SOUND] One more time.\n\n675\n00:32:17.431 --> 00:32:20.485\n[LAUGH] What are you, keeping a tally?\n\n676\n00:32:20.485 --> 00:32:21.490\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, it's always like, god.\n\n677\n00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.839\nIt makes me feel so much better,\nwhen I'm not the only one fucking up.\n\n678\n00:32:25.839 --> 00:32:27.579\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n679\n00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:28.975\n>> All right, Vonne, thanks for that.\n\n680\n00:32:28.975 --> 00:32:31.550\nA lot of great information\nthere on selecting items.\n\n681\n00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.680\nWho would've thought there would be so\nmuch on how we can select, but really,\n\n682\n00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.580\na lot of different ways we can select,\na lot of different things we can select,\n\n683\n00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.980\nand obviously a very important part\nof being efficient with Illustrator.\n\n684\n00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.018\nAnd I know you've got more to show us.\n\n685\n00:32:44.018 --> 00:32:44.715\n>> I do.\n\n686\n00:32:44.715 --> 00:32:47.571\n>> But, unfortunately,\nwe're out of time for this episode so\n\n687\n00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:49.139\nwe're gonna have to cut it here.\n\n688\n00:32:49.139 --> 00:32:51.780\nBut we'll come back for a part two.\n\n689\n00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.520\nSo hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n690\n00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.416\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n691\n00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:57.081\n>> I'm Vonne Smith.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n692\n00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:57.847\n>> Bye.\n\n693\n00:32:57.847 --> 00:33:02.978\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.560\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.069\ntoday we're going over\nAdobe Illustrator CC 2015, and\n\n5\n00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:25.490\nspecifically in this episode we're\ngoing to do some more selecting items.\n\n6\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.930\nNow, this is a part two, so if you missed\npart one, make sure you go back and\n\n7\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.810\nwatch that one first because we\ncovered a lot of stuff there.\n\n8\n00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.210\nWe're just going to kind of round out\nsome thoughts about selecting items, and\n\n9\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.220\nhere to do that for us is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.080\nHow's it going Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.660\n>> Good, back for more.\n\n12\n00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.280\nSo just wanted to throw in a few\nmore things about selecting items.\n\n13\n00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.700\nBecause we didn't cover\nthe other selection tool,\n\n14\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.780\nI only showed you the black arrow tool.\n\n15\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.430\n>> There's more.\n\n16\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.530\n>> There is, there is.\n\n17\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.370\nSo I, yeah, so I just want to show you\nthe different ways that I use them,\n\n18\n00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.540\nhow you can use them and\nsee which way is most comfortable for you.\n\n19\n00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.990\nSo let's get right into it, so,\nblack arrow tool, we got that and\n\n20\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.770\nwe're doing that.\n\n21\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.480\nWe did our click, hold, and\ndrags, and all of that.\n\n22\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.590\nIf I wanted to select, here, let's\nactually go over to this other artboard,\n\n23\n00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.650\nlet me move over here, so I can go here.\n\n24\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.316\nThat's the wrong one,\n[LAUGH] this one, okay, there we go.\n\n25\n00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:26.294\nI've got this, what if I wanted\nto select all the items on\n\n26\n00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.095\nhere that have yellow fills, or\n\n27\n00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:34.308\nall the things that have pink fills or\nsomething like that?\n\n28\n00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:37.671\nSo over in your toolbox you\nhave the black arrow tool, but\n\n29\n00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:41.315\nunderneath it you have the magic\nwand tool and the lasso tool,\n\n30\n00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.350\nwhich are tools that you\nfind in Photoshop as well.\n\n31\n00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.340\nAnd they work pretty much the same, but\n\n32\n00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.580\nit's the same but different, my favorite\nsaying, [LAUGH] which makes no sense.\n\n33\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.310\nSo we're gonna go with the magic wand,\nbecause what does that do?\n\n34\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.660\nIt selects items of similar color,\nI guess we could say it that way.\n\n35\n00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.820\nThat's how we talk about it in Photoshop,\nbut it's like, things that are the same.\n\n36\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.960\nSo, if I take my magic wand and\nI single click on this yellow square,\n\n37\n00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.380\nyou can see that selects this one,\n\n38\n00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.620\nthis one, this one, and this one,\nall by me just clicking on one part.\n\n39\n00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.750\nIf I single click on the pink you can\nsee that it selects one, two, three.\n\n40\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.435\nIt's kind of hard because I got a blue\noutline on that but they are selected.\n\n41\n00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:29.060\nSo, you can kind of see that\nway that you're selecting.\n\n42\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.730\nAnd so it's got that, so that's kind\nof a nice way to select multiple items.\n\n43\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.960\nOkay, and that's all well and good.\n\n44\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.010\nIf you go to the lasso tool, okay, let me\njust click off of this so I can deselect.\n\n45\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.340\nIf I wanted to grab this guy,\nall of these guys,\n\n46\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.510\nyou could just click, hold and\ndrag around these weird shapes.\n\n47\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.180\nI couldn't really draw, I couldn't\nmake a selection marquee with drawing\n\n48\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.060\na box with a black arrow tool around these\ntwo items because it would grab the text.\n\n49\n00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.810\n>> It was touching those other items.\n\n50\n00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.610\n>> Yeah, exactly, so\nyou can make some kind of weird\n\n51\n00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.840\nselection patterns basically, [LAUGH] I\ndon't know how else to really say it.\n\n52\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.650\nSo you can just lasso up what you want.\n\n53\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.510\n>> That can be very handy.\n\n54\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.360\n>> Yeah, so just different ways you\ncan select these different pieces.\n\n55\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.580\n>> I got a question for you.\n\n56\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.070\nIf we go back to that magic wand, you\nclicked on something that was yellow, and\n\n57\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.060\nit selected all the other yellow items,\nbut yellow is kinda vague,\n\n58\n00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.340\nwe can have lots of\ndifferent shades of yellow.\n\n59\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.300\nHow does it handle that kind of thing?\n\n60\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.730\n>> Great point, because the magic wand\nworks on something known as tolerance,\n\n61\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.070\nwhich is the exact same thing\nthat you had in Photoshop.\n\n62\n00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.480\nSo let me demonstrate one of them here.\n\n63\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.490\nWe have this select flowers file,\nso this is kind like what\n\n64\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.900\nthe example you're talking about, it's not\nyellow, but it's like this peachy color.\n\n65\n00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.020\n>> And there's different shades.\n\n66\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.430\n>> There are different shades, right.\n\n67\n00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.400\nSo if I clicked on this, you're like okay,\nso that's all that same color, and just to\n\n68\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.800\nchange the color so you can see it's like,\nwait, I thought there was multiples.\n\n69\n00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.180\nSo it was grabbing what it\nsaw within its tolerance\n\n70\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.610\nof what varying shades of this peach color\nit's allowed or it's going to select.\n\n71\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.310\n>> So by default it's not exact,\n\n72\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.860\nit'll give you a little leeway\neither way on that color.\n\n73\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.650\n>> With the default tolerance set.\n\n74\n00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.830\n>> Okay.\n>> So it's,\n\n75\n00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.240\nwell then how do I change the tolerance?\n\n76\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.890\n>> What if I wanted to get all of those\nand it was outside of the tolerance?\n\n77\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.010\n>> Or if you were saying,\nI did want it to be exact or less or more.\n\n78\n00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.610\nIt's changing the preference\nof the tool and\n\n79\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.750\nthat's how you get to it is by\ndouble clicking on that tool.\n\n80\n00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.580\nSo if I double click on the magic wand\ntool, that actually brings up the magic\n\n81\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.010\nwand options and you can see that this\ngives you a couple things right here.\n\n82\n00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.100\nSo I can go over the fill or\n\n83\n00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.020\nthe stroke because this always\ngonna select the same fills,\n\n84\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.600\ncuz that's what the tool option and by\ndefault and the tolerance has set at 20.\n\n85\n00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.380\nAnd you can change that less or\n\n86\n00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.580\nlower times means more exact color,\nso not as wide range of colors.\n\n87\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.070\nThe higher the tolerance,\nthe wider range of colors or\n\n88\n00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.530\nthings that it's going to\nbe selecting on there.\n\n89\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.960\nSomething to just point out,\n\n90\n00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.330\nbecause a lot of people are like, it's\njust gonna select this exact, not really.\n\n91\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.860\nBut our other file, the colors are so\n\n92\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.060\nfar apart from each other and so different\nthat it didn't make that distinction.\n\n93\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.520\nSo, that is the magic wand, like that.\n\n94\n00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.560\nSomething else that I like to do,\n\n95\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.760\nbecause the magic wand just wasn't my tool\nto go to, when I was in Illustrator, so,\n\n96\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.910\nI use the select menu, which I actually\ndiscovered long, much further down\n\n97\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.790\nthe road of using Illustrator, and came\nback and, man, why didn't I know that?\n\n98\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.020\nSo I'm gonna show you.\n\n99\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.850\nSo if I have this particular\npetal of this flower selected,\n\n100\n00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.530\nand I want to select all of the ones\nthat have the same color, I can make it\n\n101\n00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.300\nselect first so it has to have something\nto base itself upon, this is what I want.\n\n102\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.160\nView the select menu, you can go to same\nand you can see I can say same fill.\n\n103\n00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.020\nAnd notice tere's a lot of different\noptions in here so this is really,\n\n104\n00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.830\nreally great.\n\n105\n00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.620\nSo if I go to select same fill color,\nit's gonna select just that particular\n\n106\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.610\nfill color cuz I said\nall right I want that.\n\n107\n00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.790\nAnd then maybe just for fun we'll\nlike change that to that color blue.\n\n108\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.240\nSo now I wanna change this particular one,\nso let me select all the same fill color,\n\n109\n00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.210\nand we can keep on going I\nthink you get the idea here\n\n110\n00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.870\nis that I can just keep on\nselecting the same things.\n\n111\n00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.740\n>> Nice.\n\n112\n00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.572\n>> Now I have to finish this flower,\njust because I have to.\n\n113\n00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:44.101\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Now,\n\n114\n00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:46.900\nis that based on any type of tolerance,\nor that's doing the exact color?\n\n115\n00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.220\n>> That's the exact same, the exact.\n\n116\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.810\n>> Okay.\nSo you can actually use that instead of\n\n117\n00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.518\nchanging your tolerance on the magic wand.\n\n118\n00:06:52.518 --> 00:06:53.722\n>> Yeah, yeah,\n\n119\n00:06:53.722 --> 00:06:58.780\nexactly, perfect that's exactly why I did\nit and it's a one to one type of match.\n\n120\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.270\nAnd if you come over here,\nthis is where it's not just the fill,\n\n121\n00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.600\nthere's a whole bunch of\nother things you can do.\n\n122\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.210\nLike the same opacity,\n\n123\n00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.695\nmaybe everything's at a different opacity\nrating or the same fill and stroke,\n\n124\n00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:17.670\nthey have to have both, so it's like\ncriteria of what you want it to select.\n\n125\n00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.210\n>> Wow that's nice.\n\n126\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.330\n>> And another thing in this select menu\nthat I always like is in this object, so\n\n127\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.990\nnow I have nothing selected by the way,\nnothing is on, if I go to select object\n\n128\n00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.080\nand say maybe all text objects, that's\nkind of cool, so give me all the text.\n\n129\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.850\n>> So if I wanna change all the fonts\nat one time I don't have to go around\n\n130\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.730\nclicking on each instance of a text.\n\n131\n00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.870\n>> Yeah.\n\n132\n00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.130\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah, and\n\n133\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.078\nthis is one that straight points.\n\n134\n00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:46.686\nHuge.\n>> Yeah.\n\n135\n00:07:46.686 --> 00:07:49.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah, so that is really,\n\n136\n00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.850\nreally great.\n\n137\n00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.480\nI use this a lot, especially when I'm\nmodifying logos or if I've done traces and\n\n138\n00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.430\nthings like that, I just need to get\nall of the stray points away from it.\n\n139\n00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.360\n>> Those can be really\nhard to find sometimes.\n\n140\n00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.880\n>> Yes.\n\n141\n00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.960\nVery, yeah, they don't exist because they\ndon't have any, they exist, but not in\n\n142\n00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.102\nthis preview mode because it doesn't have\na color a lot of times, it's just a point.\n\n143\n00:08:10.102 --> 00:08:12.790\nBut that's pretty nice,\nI wanted to show you guys that.\n\n144\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.532\nAnd since we're talking about a point,\nthe other thing in this kinda\n\n145\n00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:22.330\ngroup up of selection tools, cuz you\nsee in our tool bar, our tool box, it\n\n146\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.030\nhas these little kind of separation lines\nlike there's these and then there's these.\n\n147\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.920\nThese top four tools are the selection\ntool and the one we didn't go\n\n148\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.010\nover was the white arrow, there's\na black arrow and there's a white arrow.\n\n149\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.120\nSo what does the white arrow do?\n\n150\n00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.850\nThe white arrow is for points, so\n\n151\n00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:43.690\nthe points on a vector path because like\nover here let's go with this square.\n\n152\n00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:49.630\nThis yellow square, it has four points,\nbecause there's on the corners,\n\n153\n00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.790\nand the then path or\nlines are in between those points, so\n\n154\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.720\nif I black arrow it gives me everything,\nthat's my whole thing.\n\n155\n00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.560\nThe white now, notice that I clicked\noff first, my white if I hover,\n\n156\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.040\nyou still gotta look for\nthe end of the dot, the end of the tail,\n\n157\n00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.635\nthat's a little bit different on this one.\n\n158\n00:09:06.635 --> 00:09:12.130\nSee if I hover over here, you see how\nits showing me with the smart guides,\n\n159\n00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:17.230\nor the kind of helper guide thingies,\nguide thingies, yeah, it says that\n\n160\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:22.850\nI'm hovered over an anchor, and the dot\nat the end of the white arrow is hollow.\n\n161\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.140\nVersus here, see how that's solid?\n\n162\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:33.570\nThat's not a point, I'm on the path,\nif I'm on a point, it's gonna go hollow,\n\n163\n00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.590\nand it kind of highlights itself,\nif you wanna say, on the path that you do.\n\n164\n00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.700\nSo if I single click it,\nthat is my selected point.\n\n165\n00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.570\nIt's kinda hard, it might be hard to\nsee but see how that little tiny.\n\n166\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.750\n>> That one corner is now\na little bit highlighted.\n\n167\n00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.670\n>> Yeah, and\nthen this one over here on the left,\n\n168\n00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.050\nI don't know if I can make it any bigger,\nthat one is hollow.\n\n169\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:10:00.050\nOkay, so I've selected,\nthis is my selected point that I have.\n\n170\n00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.360\nAnd if I'm over that selected point,\nI can do things like move it,\n\n171\n00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.810\nbecause if I have, oops, too far up.\n\n172\n00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.710\nIf I have a square, if I take this and\n\n173\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.770\nI move this anchor point,\nwell I could make it into a triangle.\n\n174\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:16.985\n>> Yeah, pretty fancy.\n\n175\n00:10:16.985 --> 00:10:18.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you can move and\n\n176\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:23.995\nyou can select your points, so\nblack is for whole, white is for point.\n\n177\n00:10:23.995 --> 00:10:26.290\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Or a piece, whole or piece,\n\n178\n00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:30.350\nthat's how I've always described it,\nas the black and the white arrow tool.\n\n179\n00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.830\nThat's what we got.\n\n180\n00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.160\n>> All right, Vonne, again a lot of great\ninformation about selecting objects,\n\n181\n00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.120\nkind of round it out\nthe thought process there about\n\n182\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.290\nhow we can select different objects so\nthat we can turn around and affect them.\n\n183\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.290\nSo thank you for that,\nthank you for sharing that with us.\n\n184\n00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.970\nI know we enjoyed shooting this episode,\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n185\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.900\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n186\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.578\n>> I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n187\n00:10:53.578 --> 00:10:58.391\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n188\n00:10:58.391 --> 00:10:59.019\n>> Bye.\n\n189\n00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:00.899\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:21.068\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today,\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:25.267\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be focusing in on creating basic\n\n5\n00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:27.830\nshapes and doing some basic formatting.\n\n6\n00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.930\nAnd here as always is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.960\nHow's it going Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.870\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.181\nGlad to be back to actually creating\nsome items in our Photoshop documents.\n\n10\n00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:41.086\nCuz up until now, we've just been\nkind of exploring the environment and\n\n11\n00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:41.988\ngetting ready.\n\n12\n00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:45.578\nAnd I've been giving you all those teasers\nof like well, that's coming up now.\n\n13\n00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:46.918\nSo we're gonna start again.\n\n14\n00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:48.118\n>> That's kinda deflating,\nlet's get in there.\n\n15\n00:00:48.118 --> 00:00:52.645\n>> Yes, now I can actually show you how\nto create some of those awesome shapes,\n\n16\n00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:55.348\nand how to organize them and\nall of that, so.\n\n17\n00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:56.780\n>> Sounds good.\n\n18\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.218\n>> Why don't we just jump right in to it?\n\n19\n00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:01.436\nAnd I figure before we actually\nstart creating some basic shapes,\n\n20\n00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:04.138\nwe have to go over how to\nactually make a new file?\n\n21\n00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:07.999\nSo we're gonna go over the new file\nsettings, give you kind of a quick\n\n22\n00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:11.338\noverview, get into those art boards and\ndraw some shapes.\n\n23\n00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:12.276\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n24\n00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:13.490\n>> Let's go.\n\n25\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.949\nSo I've got Illustrator\nalready opened up for me and\n\n26\n00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:19.548\nI've got my workspace all organized.\n\n27\n00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:21.319\nI try to minimize it a little bit, so\n\n28\n00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.740\nI'm only focusing on panels that\nwe'll probably be working with right.\n\n29\n00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.160\nSo we're gonna go to File > New or\ncommander Ctrl+N is for File,\n\n30\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.230\nNew here and\nhere's the New Document settings.\n\n31\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.078\nThere's not too much going on in here, so.\n\n32\n00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:39.628\nSo we don't have a lot to really go over,\nbut when I'm making something new in\n\n33\n00:01:39.628 --> 00:01:42.988\nIllustrator, you do have to\nthink of the final product.\n\n34\n00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:43.788\nWhere am I going?\n\n35\n00:01:43.788 --> 00:01:44.468\nWhat am I creating?\n\n36\n00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:45.928\nAm I creating a logo?\n\n37\n00:01:45.928 --> 00:01:49.366\nAm I creating a web banner?\n\n38\n00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:53.236\nAlmost like taking out a piece of paper\nand drawing, do I really even have\n\n39\n00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:57.050\nto constrain myself to a specific size\nthat the document needs to be in?\n\n40\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.470\nBut if you are working in a web banner you\n\n41\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.770\ndo need to know the dimensions\nthat you're going to end up in.\n\n42\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.350\nLike if I need a web banner that's\ngonna be 500 pixels by 200 pixels,\n\n43\n00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.690\nthen I should know that and set that here.\n\n44\n00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.490\nIf I'm doing a half page ad,\n\n45\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.325\nthen I need to to a half page if its\na half letter size and that's, what?\n\n46\n00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:18.350\nThat's eight and\na half by four and a half.\n\n47\n00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.353\nWait, no.\n\n48\n00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:20.533\n>> Five and a half.\n\n49\n00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:21.353\n>> It's just half of letter.\n\n50\n00:02:21.353 --> 00:02:24.155\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so you have to kinda think of\n\n51\n00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:29.090\nthat unit of measurement that you're\ngonna be working in, and then the size.\n\n52\n00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.713\nSo right here,\nwhen you start with Illustrator,\n\n53\n00:02:31.713 --> 00:02:34.528\nalways defaults to measuring\neverything in points.\n\n54\n00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:37.578\nNow there's nothing wrong\nwith measuring endpoints, but\n\n55\n00:02:37.578 --> 00:02:40.448\nI usually think of things\nmostly in inches or in pixels.\n\n56\n00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:44.048\nBecause those are the two\nmediums I normally work in.\n\n57\n00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:46.350\nThey don't actually have picas in here,\n\n58\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.655\nwhich I lied as soon as put down the-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:49.775\n>> Drop down for the unit,\n\n60\n00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:50.735\nthey do have picas.\n\n61\n00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:51.375\n>> We'll put it back.\n\n62\n00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:53.076\n>> But yeah, so\nlet's pretend I didn't do it.\n\n63\n00:02:53.076 --> 00:02:55.693\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes, they do have picas so\n\n64\n00:02:55.693 --> 00:02:57.270\nif you wanna do that thing, that's fine.\n\n65\n00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.600\nSo the units right over here,\nall the ones that we wanna do.\n\n66\n00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.621\nI'm gonna stay in inches for now for this\nparticular file that we're gonna create\n\n67\n00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.892\ntoday, because it is really like\njust drawing on a piece of paper.\n\n68\n00:03:08.892 --> 00:03:11.146\n>> Right.\n>> I don't have to constrain myself\n\n69\n00:03:11.146 --> 00:03:11.710\nto that.\n\n70\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.220\nAnd I can put in the width and the height.\n\n71\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.130\nThey do have some predetermined\nsizes that I'm working in.\n\n72\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.620\nBut the reason that it's showing these\nparticular sizes of paper that you would\n\n73\n00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.450\nnormally think of, is because I actually\nstarted out with a specific profile.\n\n74\n00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.080\nBecause I changed the units, it actually\nwent back to Custom right here.\n\n75\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.029\nBut it did start off on Print and\nyou can see once I put it back to Print,\n\n76\n00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.728\nthat it does default to the measurement\nsystem being in points.\n\n77\n00:03:40.728 --> 00:03:43.768\nSo let's go over just a few\nof those basic profiles.\n\n78\n00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:46.806\nIf I am working in web,\nsee I can go ahead and\n\n79\n00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:50.698\nswitch the units by changing\nthe profile or the units.\n\n80\n00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:55.591\nBut also, when you change the profile,\nyou are gonna change the predetermined\n\n81\n00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.378\nsizes that are available\nto you as an option.\n\n82\n00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:02.429\nSo you can see now,\nI have screen resolution sizes.\n\n83\n00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.140\nThe 1024x768, things like that.\n\n84\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.020\nIf I switch this back up to a device,\nwell let's actually choose Device.\n\n85\n00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.035\nWhen I choose that,\n\n86\n00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:15.150\nyou can see it actually shows\nyou the different device sizes.\n\n87\n00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.850\nWhich is kinda cool.\n\n88\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.084\n>> Right.\n>> If you're going to be creating graphics\n\n89\n00:04:18.084 --> 00:04:20.430\nor anything for these particular devices.\n\n90\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.760\nI think you get the idea that with\nthe video, is going to go ahead and\n\n91\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.690\ngive you specific video sizes there.\n\n92\n00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.208\nSo you can start with a Profile and\nmodify from there.\n\n93\n00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:33.790\nAnd then type in your own things that\nyou want, so it's really up to you.\n\n94\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.700\nYou control what you want\nyour document to start off.\n\n95\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.558\nTwo other things we should probably\npoint out, well maybe three.\n\n96\n00:04:40.558 --> 00:04:45.233\nNumber of art boards, the art board\nis what you're drawing on and\n\n97\n00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:47.440\nit always starts with one.\n\n98\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.760\nIf I know I'm going to be\ncreating maybe a half page ad and\n\n99\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.680\na banner, why do it in two separate files?\n\n100\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.840\nJust do it all in one.\n\n101\n00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.340\nYou can start saying, like I want two\nart boards right from the beginning.\n\n102\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.310\nYou can do that, but\nmaybe you don't know that far ahead.\n\n103\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.178\nYou can always create art boards after the\nfact, which is what I'm gonna show you.\n\n104\n00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:06.878\nSo we're just gonna keep it at one and\nthe bleeds.\n\n105\n00:05:06.878 --> 00:05:08.118\nYeah?\n\n106\n00:05:08.118 --> 00:05:11.830\n>> Say you did two art boards,\ndo you preset the sizes differently for\n\n107\n00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.417\neach one of those or do they both\ntake the same sizes and options?\n\n108\n00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:16.496\n>> You know what?\n\n109\n00:05:16.496 --> 00:05:17.236\nI don't even know.\n\n110\n00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:18.134\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n111\n00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:19.974\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think they take the same size.\n\n112\n00:05:19.974 --> 00:05:22.054\n>> Gosh.\n>> Let's try it, how about that.\n\n113\n00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:23.374\n>> And then you could change it up later.\n\n114\n00:05:23.374 --> 00:05:24.430\n>> Yeah, you're right.\n\n115\n00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.388\n[LAUGH] So we'll take the same size.\n\n116\n00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:28.849\nGreat to give me a question\nthat I don't know-\n\n117\n00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:29.488\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n118\n00:05:29.488 --> 00:05:30.868\n>> The answer to, thanks you so much Mike.\n\n119\n00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:31.488\n>> That's what they pay me for.\n\n120\n00:05:31.488 --> 00:05:32.128\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n121\n00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:34.428\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To pester me.\n\n122\n00:05:34.428 --> 00:05:38.708\nSo we'll go with two just to see what\nhappens when Mike throws me a curve ball.\n\n123\n00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:43.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Bleeds, bleeds are areas that\n\n124\n00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.408\nare beyond the sides of the paper\nthat go for a printing.\n\n125\n00:05:50.408 --> 00:05:52.949\nSo if you're doing a full page ad and\n\n126\n00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.350\nyou want the color to go\nall the way to the edges.\n\n127\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.530\nNow we're talking like\ncommercial printing.\n\n128\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.060\nYou're gonna send this off to\nsomewhere and have it nicely done.\n\n129\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.745\nYou want to set color or anything\nthat does have color to a specific\n\n130\n00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:08.470\namount of space past your art board for\n\n131\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.858\nwhen in the commercial printing process\nwhere it actually cuts the paper.\n\n132\n00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:15.858\nSo you get that full color at the edge.\n\n133\n00:06:15.858 --> 00:06:19.138\n>> Otherwise you might not get the color\nall the way to the edge of the art.\n\n134\n00:06:19.138 --> 00:06:22.676\n>> Exactly, it doesn't just\nhappen automatically, paper and\n\n135\n00:06:22.676 --> 00:06:24.810\nink just goes all the way there.\n\n136\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.810\nIt does require making paper\nthat is bigger than what your\n\n137\n00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.730\nactual artwork looks like, and\nthen it trims it down to it.\n\n138\n00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.168\nSo you have your bleeds.\n\n139\n00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:38.839\nNormally, commercial Bleeds settings\nare about an eighth of an inch.\n\n140\n00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.508\nAlways talk to your printer\nbefore you even start designing.\n\n141\n00:06:41.508 --> 00:06:44.406\nAs I always say, design backwards,\nmake sure you know where you're going.\n\n142\n00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:46.718\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nput them in there just for fun.\n\n143\n00:06:46.718 --> 00:06:49.450\nI use a little bumpy arrow,\nand they are constrained.\n\n144\n00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.522\nAnd so if you only had a bleed on say,\nthe right side and not the other side,\n\n145\n00:06:53.522 --> 00:06:56.428\nyou could set that by unchecking or\nunlocking that.\n\n146\n00:06:56.428 --> 00:07:01.220\nAnd then each one of your bleeds could\nbe set differently from each other.\n\n147\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.508\nBut I usually keep them constrained for\nthese demonstration purposes.\n\n148\n00:07:04.508 --> 00:07:07.590\nReally quickly,\nover these Advanced settings.\n\n149\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.800\nThese are settings that you normally\nwouldn't have to worry about, but\n\n150\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.650\nI think you should at least go over it.\n\n151\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.680\nBecause I guess in some senses\nyou could worry about it.\n\n152\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.900\nIn the print profile that we started with,\n\n153\n00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.820\nit is going to default that\nwe're in a CMYK color mode.\n\n154\n00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.062\nAnd that is of course for\n\n155\n00:07:27.062 --> 00:07:29.888\nthe color space that you would\nwork with in commercial printing.\n\n156\n00:07:29.888 --> 00:07:34.968\nIf you change this over to Web,\nthis would be changing into RBG.\n\n157\n00:07:34.968 --> 00:07:37.628\nSo I said it actually doesn't matter,\nactually it matters a lot.\n\n158\n00:07:37.628 --> 00:07:40.448\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right-\n\n159\n00:07:40.448 --> 00:07:41.668\n>> But you kinda decide for,\n\n160\n00:07:41.668 --> 00:07:44.275\nif you don't open up the Advanced\noptions you pick Web,\n\n161\n00:07:44.275 --> 00:07:45.940\nit knows what's best for Web.\n\n162\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.531\n>> There you go,\nthat's a much better explanation than-\n\n163\n00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:48.331\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:07:48.331 --> 00:07:50.261\n>> It matters well yeah, it does,\n\n165\n00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.908\nit does matter but it does.\n\n166\n00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:55.342\nLike you're saying, it picks\nthe formatting or settings by default for\n\n167\n00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:56.637\nwhatever profile you are,\n\n168\n00:07:56.637 --> 00:08:00.202\ncuz if your working on web you do probably\nwanna stay in your RGB color mode.\n\n169\n00:08:00.202 --> 00:08:04.762\nAnd the raster effects for\nwhen your actually adding raster graphics,\n\n170\n00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:07.658\nsay you're adding images to your creation.\n\n171\n00:08:07.658 --> 00:08:12.658\nThen any effects that you would do in the\nEffect menu would be at this particular\n\n172\n00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:13.580\nresolution.\n\n173\n00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.900\nA lot of times, if you're going to be\nworking in both mediums, like, say,\n\n174\n00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:22.880\ncreating a logo or\ncreating an advertisement or whatever,\n\n175\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.250\nand you are going to both spaces,\nI would stay in commercial print first.\n\n176\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.080\nBecause you always wanna design for\nlike the lower gamut of color ranges,\n\n177\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.770\nrather than the higher gamut and that way,\n\n178\n00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.910\nyou don't get kind of mixed up when\nyour colors clip and everything.\n\n179\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.480\nBut we go over colors in great\ndetail in other episodes.\n\n180\n00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.065\nSo anyways,\njust wanna throw that out there.\n\n181\n00:08:41.065 --> 00:08:44.080\nOkay, so, that's your new file settings.\n\n182\n00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.950\nSo let's go back to inches just\nbecause I want to do that, all right.\n\n183\n00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.488\nAnd we weren't gonna do two art boards\ncuz you wanted me to do two art boards.\n\n184\n00:08:51.488 --> 00:08:52.195\nAnd they're the same size.\n\n185\n00:08:52.195 --> 00:08:54.890\n[LAUGH] Perfect, okay, good.\n\n186\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.120\nSo let's actually jump\ninto art boards now.\n\n187\n00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.540\nBecause what if I had not set two\nart boards, and I only had one?\n\n188\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.480\nOr maybe here, since Mike wanted\nme to do two art boards, and\n\n189\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.800\nI really only wanted one?\n\n190\n00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.980\nHow do I get rid of that second one?\n\n191\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.320\nWell, I go to the art board tool.\n\n192\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.150\nOkay, there's a couple ways over it,\nyou do have an art board panel, so\n\n193\n00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.670\nI'm gonna kind of show you both ways.\n\n194\n00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.550\nBut you can see in the art board panel and\nthe art board tool\n\n195\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.835\nthat it brings up like the,\nit's almost like the crop in Photoshop?\n\n196\n00:09:21.835 --> 00:09:25.240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it brings up the bounding boxes, and\n\n197\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.650\nthen your control panel up at the top\nis going to give you the settings for\n\n198\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.410\nart boards.\n\n199\n00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.670\nOkay, and if I click once over here,\nyou can see that this is highlighting or\n\n200\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.351\nselecting art board to changes\nover here in the art boards panel.\n\n201\n00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:42.131\nAnd I can do things like take this\nart board that's already created and\n\n202\n00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:43.100\nchange its size.\n\n203\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.680\nMaybe I'll change art board too.\n\n204\n00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.562\nYou can change the presets, so\nmaybe I'm doing a tabloid size.\n\n205\n00:09:50.562 --> 00:09:54.790\nIt kinda went over my other art board,\nso you can move your art board over.\n\n206\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.480\nIf I wanted to change it\nto maybe like a screen size\n\n207\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.210\nlike that because maybe I'm doing\na screen thing, I can do that.\n\n208\n00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.950\nOr I can type in the specific measurements\nover here in the width and height.\n\n209\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.298\nMaybe I know I'm gonna be doing\nlike a 5 inch by 5 inch sticker or\n\n210\n00:10:10.298 --> 00:10:11.790\nsomething like that.\n\n211\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.670\nSo I can type that in.\n\n212\n00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.510\nOr you can actually take the two pointed\narrows on the corners or the edges.\n\n213\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.983\nAnd you can free form size whatever\nsize art board that I want to do.\n\n214\n00:10:20.983 --> 00:10:21.598\n>> Easy.\n\n215\n00:10:21.598 --> 00:10:22.530\n>> Yeah, it's pretty awesome.\n\n216\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.500\nAnd then you can move this over and\ndo whatever you want.\n\n217\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.910\nNow while I'm still on the art board tool,\nmaybe I want a third art board, right?\n\n218\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.440\nWell, then you just go somewhere down in\nthis new area, and you can click, hold,\n\n219\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.540\nand drag, just like when we're\ngoing to be making our rectangles,\n\n220\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.770\nyou can click, hold, and drag.\n\n221\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.769\nYou could also come over here, some of\nthese buttons up here, there it is.\n\n222\n00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:46.480\n[LAUGH] A little piece of paper,\nyou can click on this new art board.\n\n223\n00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.940\nAnd then it will go ahead and\ngive you whatever set you had last time.\n\n224\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.160\nAnd I can kinda like put it there.\n\n225\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.706\nIt's kind of off, not really wanting\nthem on top of each other, so\n\n226\n00:10:53.706 --> 00:10:54.870\nI can move it over there.\n\n227\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:01.600\nAnd you can rename them, we can be like 4,\ncuz I can't think of anything else.\n\n228\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.780\nClick on art board 3,\nand so on, and so forth.\n\n229\n00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.450\nThe naming of your art board, while it\nmight not seem very important to you,\n\n230\n00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.709\nbecause you know like I know what\nI'm doing on each art board.\n\n231\n00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:16.140\nWhen you get into your export options, and\nwe can actually export your art boards,\n\n232\n00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.500\nit will make it a little bit easier for\n\n233\n00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.870\nyou if you know that I'm gonna\nhave to name that particular\n\n234\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.410\nfile that's gonna come out of these art\nboards a specific way, just do it there.\n\n235\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.357\nSo it's kind of cool that way.\n\n236\n00:11:26.357 --> 00:11:28.229\n>> So it picks up the name of\nthe art board when you export it,\n\n237\n00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.365\nit makes that the name of the file?\n\n238\n00:11:29.365 --> 00:11:29.944\n>> Correct.\n\n239\n00:11:29.944 --> 00:11:31.384\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n240\n00:11:31.384 --> 00:11:35.480\nAnd you could also control your\nart board naming from over here.\n\n241\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.252\nLike if I wanted to rename\nmy art board from my panel,\n\n242\n00:11:38.252 --> 00:11:40.153\nI can double click on the name here.\n\n243\n00:11:40.153 --> 00:11:45.102\nAnd I can just name this 2,\nand so on and so forth, and 3,\n\n244\n00:11:45.102 --> 00:11:48.234\nI think you get the idea here, okay.\n\n245\n00:11:48.234 --> 00:11:51.340\nSo the art board tool and\nthe art board panel are really great.\n\n246\n00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.320\nI'm zooming in and out so\n\n247\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.840\nI can move around, what if I don't\nwant this art board anymore?\n\n248\n00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.694\nI can just hit the Delete key or the,\nwhat's the other thing for delete?\n\n249\n00:11:58.694 --> 00:11:59.194\n>> Backspace?\n\n250\n00:11:59.194 --> 00:12:00.356\n>> Backspace, thank you,\n\n251\n00:12:00.356 --> 00:12:04.080\n[LAUGH] since it's labeled the same,\nI'm staring at it on my Mac.\n\n252\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.860\nSo you could go ahead and delete these\ndifferent art boards and move on.\n\n253\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.030\nAnd there you go.\n\n254\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.600\nSo a lot of times, I don't know\nI need art boards until later.\n\n255\n00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.480\nSo just create them, you kind of draw\non your piece of paper that we're gonna\n\n256\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.560\ndraw on, and\nthen I know I'm gonna need other things.\n\n257\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.460\nI make my art boards, copy what I\nneed over, and do what I need to do.\n\n258\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.375\n>> Nice, very good.\n\n259\n00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:27.382\nAll right, so we got our art boards down,\nthat gives us our surface basically that\n\n260\n00:12:27.382 --> 00:12:30.330\nwe can now start maybe\ncreating some basic shapes on.\n\n261\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.230\n>> That's what we're gonna do.\n\n262\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.720\n>> All right.\n>> Yeah, so let's go ahead and\n\n263\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.330\nstart with our basic shape tools box,\ntools box?\n\n264\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.910\nYeah, all right, this guy,\n[LAUGH] the rectangle tool,\n\n265\n00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.580\nthat I'm gonna take the little\ntear off and take these tools.\n\n266\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.278\nNow all of these that are in\nthis tools guy [LAUGH],\n\n267\n00:12:48.278 --> 00:12:53.900\ndoing really good right now,\nthese are all closed paths.\n\n268\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.181\nOkay, they have the insides and\nthe outsides that we talked about in some\n\n269\n00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:01.180\nother episodes to where\nthey're not open paths.\n\n270\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.640\nThose are going to be these tools over\nhere, the line, the arc, and the spiral.\n\n271\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.290\nSo we'll go over those after\nwe go over the closed paths.\n\n272\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.110\nSo closed, insides and outsides.\n\n273\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.230\nOpen, it just has the outside,\nif you wanna say, the stroke.\n\n274\n00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.410\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna take the rectangle tools,\n\n275\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.580\nwe're gonna click on this guy,\nthe hot key is m.\n\n276\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.590\nAnd we're gonna go over a lot of the basic\nthings you can do with just a rectangle.\n\n277\n00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.140\nCuz a lot of all these things I'm gonna\nshow you is gonna apply to all of\n\n278\n00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.722\nthe tools.\n\n279\n00:13:28.722 --> 00:13:30.860\nAnd then we'll just kinda go through\neach one of them pretty quickly.\n\n280\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.794\nAll right, so I just zoomed in so\nyou could see this.\n\n281\n00:13:32.794 --> 00:13:37.430\nEasiest way to draw a rectangle is to,\nwell, draw with your mouse.\n\n282\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.230\n>> Hm.\n>> You take the tool,\n\n283\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.830\nyou got the crayon in your hand,\nas I say, you click, hold, and drag.\n\n284\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.516\nAnd you draw a little square and\nI'm keeping on holding my mouse right now\n\n285\n00:13:44.516 --> 00:13:49.210\nbecause with the smart guides that we have\nin CC, it will constrain the proportion\n\n286\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.190\nfor you automatically by putting\nthat pink line on a diagonal.\n\n287\n00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.330\nSo you know that right there,\nI know that's a perfect square.\n\n288\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.851\nIf I go there, then that's more of\na rectangle, but it will kinda and\n\n289\n00:13:58.851 --> 00:14:01.551\nyou can almost feel it snap\nalmost when it does that.\n\n290\n00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:03.571\nSo I just click, hold,\nand drag, and let go.\n\n291\n00:14:03.571 --> 00:14:06.265\nAnd then I've got this shape,\nthere's my rectangle.\n\n292\n00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:07.565\n>> Easy.\n\n293\n00:14:07.565 --> 00:14:10.771\n>> If you do know that I\nwant a perfect square,\n\n294\n00:14:10.771 --> 00:14:15.770\nI'm old school, like these smart\nguys weren't as smart before.\n\n295\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.360\nAnd they weren't as awesome to kind of\nmake this happen automatically for me.\n\n296\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.440\nSo to constrain your proportions\nwhile dragging any shape,\n\n297\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.880\nyou just hold your Shift key.\n\n298\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.510\nShift is always to constrain proportions.\n\n299\n00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.410\nSo you can see I can move my\nmouse any which way I want, and\n\n300\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.820\nI know that that's a perfect square\nbecause I am holding the Shift key.\n\n301\n00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.120\nNow, I let go when I'm done,\nand there's my square.\n\n302\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.580\nSo you can click, hold, and drag,\nand make rectangles all day long.\n\n303\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.320\nI'm still in my marquee tool and so this\nis actually the second way that you can\n\n304\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.940\ndraw a shape, but a lot of times,\npeople do it by mistake because remember,\n\n305\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.310\nI talked about clicking off, like,\nyou always wanna deselect something?\n\n306\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.170\nSo, people will have this.\n\n307\n00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.100\nThis is my like selected square right now,\nand so\n\n308\n00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.570\nI tried to click off of it, and I click\nand it says, wait, what just happened?\n\n309\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.030\nI actually brought up the dialogue box for\ndrawing a rectangle.\n\n310\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.690\nOkay, that's the second\nway that you can do it.\n\n311\n00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.361\nSo and you'll probably see me do this\nby mistake a lot through these lessons.\n\n312\n00:15:10.361 --> 00:15:12.846\nLike oops, I was trying to click off,\n\n313\n00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:16.310\nI wasn't trying to\nactually draw a rectangle.\n\n314\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.300\nBut this is kind of nice because\nwhen you click with that tool,\n\n315\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.980\nyou can type in the measurements.\n\n316\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.399\nLike if I know I need a 2\ninch by 2 inch square,\n\n317\n00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:27.700\nlike I know that without a shadow of\na doubt, I just click, I type it in.\n\n318\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.930\nAnd then there you go,\nthere's my 2 by 2 square.\n\n319\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.090\n>> So if you get the exact\nmeasurements rather than click and\n\n320\n00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.270\ndrag and hope you get it right and\nthen have to go back and adjust it,\n\n321\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.080\nyou can just click and not drag, get\nthe dialogue box, punch in the numbers.\n\n322\n00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.735\n>> Exactly.\n>> Perfect.\n\n323\n00:15:40.735 --> 00:15:43.545\n>> So, click, hold, and\ndrag, or click and type in.\n\n324\n00:15:43.545 --> 00:15:48.585\nOkay, and that does go back to my\nfavorite saying is always back to black.\n\n325\n00:15:48.585 --> 00:15:52.245\nOkay, you gotta go back to black because\nif you wanna move anything or select it,\n\n326\n00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:53.965\nyou gotta go back to\nthat black arrow tool.\n\n327\n00:15:53.965 --> 00:15:55.755\nSo don't just click off, nope.\n\n328\n00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:57.927\nNow, if you do, and you didn't want\nthat to happen, just hit the Escape key.\n\n329\n00:15:57.927 --> 00:15:59.426\nSelect nope, or click the Cancel.\n\n330\n00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:01.040\nSo it's like, no,\nI didn't wanna draw a shape.\n\n331\n00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.211\nI wanted to go back to\nthat black arrow tool.\n\n332\n00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:07.213\nAnd now that I have the Black Arrow Tool,\nnow I can go ahead and move things around,\n\n333\n00:16:07.213 --> 00:16:10.270\nand that's where, remember,\nyou don't want the tail.\n\n334\n00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.150\nYou just want the no tail because\nthat means you're over something\n\n335\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.660\nthat is selected, and\nthen I can move this over.\n\n336\n00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.510\nYou know, you're over something that can\nbe selected if you've got the dot at\n\n337\n00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.580\nthe end of the tail.\n\n338\n00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.560\nYou can click and you can move it and\nyou can do all the things.\n\n339\n00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.510\nAll those smart guides keep coming up like\nright now it's showing me that I have\n\n340\n00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:30.630\nequal distance between that top square and\nthe bottom square which is pretty awesome.\n\n341\n00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.440\nSo I can kind of move that around.\n\n342\n00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.700\nHere I can make it a little smaller,\nright, so\n\n343\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.200\nsay I want to get the corners and\nthe two point errors.\n\n344\n00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.400\nYou can actually go from the sides too,\nit doesn't matter but I am just gonna grab\n\n345\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.610\nthis corner so you can see I can resize\nthis, I can make it a little smaller.\n\n346\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.480\nI know it's perfect right there.\n\n347\n00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.530\nYou can also hold that \"Shift\" key\nwhile you're resizing something.\n\n348\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.300\nSo that way you know it\nwill stay constrained, and\n\n349\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.950\nthat doesn't mean it's going\nto be a perfect square.\n\n350\n00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.870\nLike here this is a rectangle that's\nnot an equal sided square, but\n\n351\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.560\nif I want to keep that proportion and\nresize it.\n\n352\n00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.560\nYou can hold that Shift key and\nI know that it's just gonna stay within\n\n353\n00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.360\nproportion as I make it bigger or\nmake it smaller.\n\n354\n00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.710\nSo, the shift is a very handy tool or\n\n355\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:21.510\nvery handy key you always should do when\nyou're doing anything in graphic design.\n\n356\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.270\nThere was one other thing that I forgot\nto mention cause I went to go do it and\n\n357\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.890\nI realized I didn't show you what it was.\n\n358\n00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.010\nAnd that's, I'm going to go\nback my rectangle tool, and\n\n359\n00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.400\nthat's drawing from the center.\n\n360\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.250\nBecause when I said click, hold, and drag\nit was always corner to corner, right, or\n\n361\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.820\nif I'm going, I can go up, I guess but\nit's always one side to one side.\n\n362\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.950\nWhat if I wanted to go from the middle?\n\n363\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.929\nThat's Alt or your Option key.\n\n364\n00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:45.601\nIf you hold Alt or Option,\n\n365\n00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:50.237\nit kind of makes this square looking\nthing with your cursor, you click,\n\n366\n00:17:50.237 --> 00:17:54.723\nhold and drag up and out and you see\nhow it's going from the inside out.\n\n367\n00:17:54.723 --> 00:17:57.281\nYou can hold your Shift key\nwhile you're doing that and\n\n368\n00:17:57.281 --> 00:17:59.461\nthat's going to constrain the proportions.\n\n369\n00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:03.257\nSo, Alt is always center,\nShift is always constrained.\n\n370\n00:18:03.257 --> 00:18:07.604\nOkay, and the same thing happens,\nim switching over to my Black Arrow Tool\n\n371\n00:18:07.604 --> 00:18:12.320\nright now, is if I wanted to size this and\nkeep it centered while I sized it.\n\n372\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.270\nTwo pointed arrows, hold the Alt key, hold\nthe Shift key, and then I can go in and\n\n373\n00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:21.700\nkeep it proportioned from that way,\ninstead of not holding the alt and\n\n374\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.850\ngoing from a corner to corner.\n\n375\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.440\nSo Alt is centered,\nShift to constrain which is great.\n\n376\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.110\nAll right, you can also take what\nI call the bendy arrows, okay?\n\n377\n00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.920\nThe bendy arrows as we go\noutside of the corner.\n\n378\n00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.190\nActually, any corner.\n\n379\n00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.330\nYou get the bendies and\nyou can then rotate it.\n\n380\n00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.992\nSo I can take this, select a square.\n\n381\n00:18:40.992 --> 00:18:44.588\nYou can see that it gives me a little\ntool tip of the angle that I'm actually\n\n382\n00:18:44.588 --> 00:18:48.307\nrotating that and then I can move that\ndown and do all of that kind of one step.\n\n383\n00:18:48.307 --> 00:18:49.583\nWonderful things.\n\n384\n00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:54.320\nNow if you want more accuracy\nwhen changing the size of any of\n\n385\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.490\nyour items you can always\ngo to the Transform menu.\n\n386\n00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.380\nIf you have a wider monitor you'll\nprobably actually see the Transform\n\n387\n00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.100\nfields up in that control panel.\n\n388\n00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.790\nYou'll see here x,y and\nyou're WNH for those types of things.\n\n389\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.090\nSince I'm a small resolutions\nyou guys can see this.\n\n390\n00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:16.340\nI don't see my panel so\nI'm gonna go over to my window menu and\n\n391\n00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.500\nscroll down and go to transform.\n\n392\n00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.190\nSo this is again this is same\nthing you would see right here\n\n393\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:26.130\nby this actually have a lot more options\nbecause I went to, if you don't see them,\n\n394\n00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:26.920\nit's probably like that.\n\n395\n00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.040\nSo just go ahead and show the options.\n\n396\n00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.270\nSo you could type in\nyour measurements here.\n\n397\n00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.843\nYou can change that rotation here.\n\n398\n00:19:32.843 --> 00:19:34.243\nSay maybe I want it at, well,\n\n399\n00:19:34.243 --> 00:19:37.392\nI guess a 90 degree on a square\nreally doesn't change anything.\n\n400\n00:19:37.392 --> 00:19:38.878\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:19:38.878 --> 00:19:40.074\n>> Let's go with 150.\n\n402\n00:19:40.074 --> 00:19:40.713\nThere we go.\n\n403\n00:19:40.713 --> 00:19:43.680\nSo now you can actually see it change.\n\n404\n00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.660\nAnd anyways just keep that in mind when\nyou're going over things, a Transform\n\n405\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:54.710\npanel will give you a lot more accuracy\nwhen doing any of those things that I did.\n\n406\n00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:59.860\nSo now that you can move and change, maybe\nwe'll make some different colors, maybe\n\n407\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:04.350\nwe'll make a pink one, we'll make a blue\none and a yellow one, so on and so forth.\n\n408\n00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.000\nSo just basic fills, right.\n\n409\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.090\nBasic inside.\n\n410\n00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.280\nNow on something I wanna change\nthe outside color I'll take the stroke.\n\n411\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.680\nSo fills and strokes.\n\n412\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.720\nMaybe I'll change the stroke color\nto purple, something like that.\n\n413\n00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.860\nThis is the stroke weight.\n\n414\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.460\nSo I can go ahead and change this to\nmake a thicker stroke right there.\n\n415\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.049\nSo all these basic formatting things that\nI can do with this particular shape.\n\n416\n00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.070\nMaybe we should go into just a little bit\nof what's going on in the Stroke panel\n\n417\n00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:38.230\njust so you can see that because you\nhave an orange title under stroke, you\n\n418\n00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:43.890\ncan go ahead and do different things and\njust change the thickness of the stroke.\n\n419\n00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:48.640\nYou can change things like the corners and\nI got a pretty thick stroke on here,\n\n420\n00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.150\nso you'll be able to see this.\n\n421\n00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.620\nWell, what do you think a corner is,\nwell, it's the corner.\n\n422\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:57.960\nSo you can see that right here that\nthis shape actually has a rounded corner\n\n423\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.960\nrather than a pointy corner.\n\n424\n00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.940\nOver here.\n\n425\n00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.540\nSo, and you've got the or the Bevelled\njoin and all this kind of stuff.\n\n426\n00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.970\nThis is one that I really like\nto do because you can see that\n\n427\n00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.860\nin the shape that I have.\n\n428\n00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:16.260\nThe blue highlighted or selected area,\nthat's the shape I made, but\n\n429\n00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:21.180\nthe stroke is going like half on and\nhalf in, half out half in, and that\n\n430\n00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:25.110\ncan throw you off especially if you wanted\nthat to have an 18 or 20 point stroke.\n\n431\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:29.780\nBut, I need it to line up to something but\nnot hang over it.\n\n432\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.110\nSo we have where the stroke\nis actually aligned.\n\n433\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.090\nLike, inside,\nsee how it goes all the way inside?\n\n434\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.580\nVersus outside, so\nthat can be super, super handy.\n\n435\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.340\nI use this feature a lot.\n\n436\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:45.731\n>> So normally, the stroke is applied\non top of the path kind of equally.\n\n437\n00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:49.168\nIf it's wider than the past itself but you\ncan make it inside or outside the path.\n\n438\n00:21:49.168 --> 00:21:49.749\n>> Yes.\n\n439\n00:21:49.749 --> 00:21:54.559\nSo that's very nice, and just sort of\na few more little things you could\n\n440\n00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:59.448\nalways make dash lines which is kind\nof fun and you can control the dash and\n\n441\n00:21:59.448 --> 00:22:05.280\nthe gap so I can type in how thin or thick\nthat dash is and then how wide the gap is.\n\n442\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.350\n>> And then I can even do all\nsorts of variations on it too.\n\n443\n00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:14.230\nIt's kind of, you start getting in\nsome really interesting stripiness.\n\n444\n00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.870\nStripy?\n\n445\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.195\nI guess dashy, we'll go with dashy.\n\n446\n00:22:16.195 --> 00:22:17.900\n>> [LAUGHS] There we go.\n\n447\n00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.850\nAnd then also where the dashes\nalign to it versus the corners.\n\n448\n00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.490\nThat can be some of your options.\n\n449\n00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.300\nSo I'm gonna turn that off.\n\n450\n00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.380\nYou see how some of this is grayed out\nbecause some of the options that you're\n\n451\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.610\ngoing to see in your panel\nonly allow you if you\n\n452\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:38.400\nhave the align stroke on just like\nthe default with the half in half out.\n\n453\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.564\nNow arrowheads are usually, you can\nprobably see them a little bit more on\n\n454\n00:22:41.564 --> 00:22:44.879\nan open path, but we can just go ahead and\ndo it now, that's kind of big, so\n\n455\n00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:48.063\nwhy don't we go ahead and make this\nstroke a little thinner so you can see.\n\n456\n00:22:48.063 --> 00:22:50.437\nSo it actually makes an arrowhead.\n\n457\n00:22:50.437 --> 00:22:53.697\nOkay, it finds where the beginning and\nending of that path remember where I\n\n458\n00:22:53.697 --> 00:22:57.060\nclicked, held and\ndragged from the left down to the right.\n\n459\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.150\nSo it does that and you can change\nthe actual scale of the arrow heads and\n\n460\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.190\nthere's all sorts of\ndifferent little icons and\n\n461\n00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.180\ndifferent things, little handy guys.\n\n462\n00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.470\nAnyways, when you get to\nthe lines where it's an open path,\n\n463\n00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.950\nthen it actually will look like\narrow heads on an open path.\n\n464\n00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.710\nBut you can do it on closed path and\nthat's why I wanted to at least\n\n465\n00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:18.060\nthrow that in there for now so\nyou can see what's going on there.\n\n466\n00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.500\nAnd you also have some width profiles\nwhich are kinda fun of where you don't\n\n467\n00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.690\nhave to have a even stroke\naround the whole thing.\n\n468\n00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.950\nI'm gonna take the arrow heads off and\nmaybe make this a little thicker so\n\n469\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:31.540\nyou can see this.\n\n470\n00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.990\nAs you see how it's uneven,\nlike it's actually going to the width of\n\n471\n00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:40.930\nthe stroke is different in different\nplaces, yeah, it's pretty awesome.\n\n472\n00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.879\nNow these are all predetermined\nwith profiles that you can use, and\n\n473\n00:23:43.879 --> 00:23:45.856\nthey're kind of fun to\nplay around with now.\n\n474\n00:23:45.856 --> 00:23:49.122\nYou can make your own widths,\nlike custom widths, and\n\n475\n00:23:49.122 --> 00:23:53.453\nwe'll maybe go over that a little bit\nlater when we get into the open pass I\n\n476\n00:23:53.453 --> 00:23:56.027\nthink it might show it\na little bit better.\n\n477\n00:23:56.027 --> 00:24:01.221\nSo those are some of your\nbasic formattings for\n\n478\n00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:06.825\nour basic rectangle shape and\nwe can go like that.\n\n479\n00:24:06.825 --> 00:24:08.406\nOkay let me go ahead and come out here.\n\n480\n00:24:08.406 --> 00:24:12.220\nFew last things while I'm\nstill on this black arrow,\n\n481\n00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.625\nif you wanted to make a copy,\nlike I wanted to duplicate this,\n\n482\n00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:20.810\nI didn't want to have,\nnow you can do copy and paste.\n\n483\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.940\nBut I don't wanna have\nto draw another one.\n\n484\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.330\nYou can select it,\nyou can hold the Alt key.\n\n485\n00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.116\nSo if you hold the Alt or\noption while it's selected and drag.\n\n486\n00:24:29.116 --> 00:24:31.693\nAlt-drag is always make a duplicate or\n\n487\n00:24:31.693 --> 00:24:35.528\ncopy so that's kind of a nice\nlittle handy-dandy thing.\n\n488\n00:24:35.528 --> 00:24:36.054\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\n\n489\n00:24:36.054 --> 00:24:38.158\nyou might spend a lot of time getting\nthat shape just the way you want it,\n\n490\n00:24:38.158 --> 00:24:39.189\nyou might need an exact copy of it.\n\n491\n00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:40.980\nDon't try to recreate it, just copy it.\n\n492\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.630\n>> Exactly.\n\n493\n00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.440\nSo we got that, all right.\n\n494\n00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.434\nSo let's get a few more things in here,\nkinda just going over all\n\n495\n00:24:49.434 --> 00:24:54.706\nthe all the basics stuff that\nwe can do with created items and\n\n496\n00:24:54.706 --> 00:24:59.079\nbecause I just feel like it's begging for\nme to save it.\n\n497\n00:24:59.079 --> 00:25:01.438\nSo it's like here, here's a company logo.\n\n498\n00:25:01.438 --> 00:25:04.523\nBut I got purple blue and yellow.\n\n499\n00:25:04.523 --> 00:25:08.265\nNow the order in which I drew these items.\n\n500\n00:25:08.265 --> 00:25:11.060\nIt's stacking on top of each other, okay?\n\n501\n00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.830\nSo the yellow is behind the blue,\nwait, yes.\n\n502\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.360\nAnd then the blue is behind the purple,\nokay?\n\n503\n00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.550\nSo that's the order.\n\n504\n00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.940\nWell, I really wanted the yellow to be\ncome forward a little bit more, right?\n\n505\n00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.310\nSo you can actually change this.\n\n506\n00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.929\nI have left-clicked and\nthen I right-clicked.\n\n507\n00:25:25.929 --> 00:25:30.090\nAnd then I go to the arrange, so you could\nactually sent it front, forward, backward.\n\n508\n00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.910\nWhat's the difference between forward and\nbackward, or front and forward?\n\n509\n00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:38.040\nLike all the way up front,\nversus all the way to, or just one level?\n\n510\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.970\nIf you don't know right now,\n\n511\n00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.500\nand we haven't really gotten\nsuper deep into layers.\n\n512\n00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.850\nBut it does kind of go\nalong that principle.\n\n513\n00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.070\nSo for right now,\nI just wanna bring it up.\n\n514\n00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.700\nSo you bring it to the front.\n\n515\n00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.850\nAnd then it comes to the front of it.\n\n516\n00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:55.240\nSo you can change that\nstacking order from there.\n\n517\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.040\nAnd I feel like I can't really say\nthat without getting into the layers,\n\n518\n00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.000\nat least for a little bit.\n\n519\n00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.450\nSo I might as well go there\nbecause I'm sure you're wondering.\n\n520\n00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.830\nSo you can see that everything\nthat I have is in layer one.\n\n521\n00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.390\nAnd in this layer you can see that\nthis is the item that I have selected.\n\n522\n00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:15.390\nThe reason I know that it is selected, and\nit might be a little bit above my head so\n\n523\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.660\nlet me bring this up.\n\n524\n00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.140\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n525\n00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.140\nOkay, so let's kind of go there.\n\n526\n00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:25.490\nSo you can see that this is the item\nthat I have on, well there we go.\n\n527\n00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.440\nSo because there's a little\nblue dot next to it.\n\n528\n00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.940\nMight be hard to see right there so,\nlet me see if, yeah there we go.\n\n529\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.000\nThere's a little blue dot that let's me\nknow that that is the item that I have\n\n530\n00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.550\nselected.\n\n531\n00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:38.030\nIf I click on the purple\narrow at the purple square,\n\n532\n00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:42.260\nyou can see over here a layers panel,\n\n533\n00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:47.270\nthat that little blue dot is next\nto the purple rectangle layer.\n\n534\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.690\nOkay, so that indicates where we're at.\n\n535\n00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.250\nSo I know that the yellow is on top.\n\n536\n00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.810\nThe purple is underneath it.\n\n537\n00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.390\nThe blue is all the way\ndown at the bottom, okay.\n\n538\n00:26:55.390 --> 00:27:00.230\nSo if I wanted to change the stacking\norder, and the arrangement from the layers\n\n539\n00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:05.950\npanel, you can take this and I can click,\nhold, and drag, and move this up.\n\n540\n00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.640\nCome on, let's go up, there we go.\n\n541\n00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.250\nOkay, and now I go right there,\nsee now I'm between.\n\n542\n00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.130\nYou always gotta look for\nthe line when you're doing that.\n\n543\n00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:21.310\nSo the blue rectangle is now\nbetween the yellow and the purple.\n\n544\n00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:27.400\nAnd so if I wanted the purple to come\nup I can pull the purple rectangle up.\n\n545\n00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.030\nGotta look for those lines.\n\n546\n00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.300\nAnd I can change the stacking\norder like that.\n\n547\n00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.830\nSo it's all based upon where those\nitems are within the layers.\n\n548\n00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.250\nAnd then of course the layers also\nhave their own stacking order.\n\n549\n00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:43.840\nBut we'll get into a little bit more of\nthat when we go directly into layers.\n\n550\n00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.017\nA little bit more in depth.\n\n551\n00:27:46.017 --> 00:27:46.517\nSo.\n\n552\n00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.308\nAll right, so we've got a few things here.\n\n553\n00:27:49.308 --> 00:27:52.647\nJust maybe a few more little items.\n\n554\n00:27:52.647 --> 00:27:54.628\nCuz I can tell you're starting to say,\nwe're starting to get a little long.\n\n555\n00:27:54.628 --> 00:27:55.805\nWe should kinda move on.\n\n556\n00:27:55.805 --> 00:27:59.720\nAll right, and\nI only got to the rectangles.\n\n557\n00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.551\n>> Well that's what I was getting excited\nabout was the other tools in there.\n\n558\n00:28:02.551 --> 00:28:04.092\nWe haven't seen circles and other.\n\n559\n00:28:04.092 --> 00:28:08.925\n>> [CROSSTALK] I know, because the other\nthings will apply to all the other tools.\n\n560\n00:28:08.925 --> 00:28:12.176\nSo, we'll kind of go through\nkind of covering a lot at once.\n\n561\n00:28:12.176 --> 00:28:13.514\n>> You've learned one,\nyou've learned them all.\n\n562\n00:28:13.514 --> 00:28:14.810\n>> Exactly, yes.\n\n563\n00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:19.589\nSo, let's go to the black arrow tool,\nremoving this, we've done alt-drag, so\n\n564\n00:28:19.589 --> 00:28:21.590\nnow I'm kind of going over this.\n\n565\n00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:28.200\nI know what I wanted to show you is\nthe black arrow versus the white arrow,\n\n566\n00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.030\nokay that's another basic principle\nwhen we're talking about path.\n\n567\n00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.940\nThe black arrow's always for the hole,\nthe white arrow's always for the points\n\n568\n00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:42.370\nbecause I'm moving this whole square,\nI'm changing the size of the whole square.\n\n569\n00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:47.350\nI'm rotating the whole square but\nthis path has\n\n570\n00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:52.000\npoints along the way and if I wanted\nto move this point in because this\n\n571\n00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.990\nrectangle could actually look like\na triangle, if I really wanted it to.\n\n572\n00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:02.840\nThe white arrow or direct selection a is\nthe hotkey that is for your points, okay?\n\n573\n00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.570\nSo if I hover over this and I get right\nthere you can see it right there with that\n\n574\n00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:11.830\nanchor point that actually tells me if I\nclick on that, I just clicked it once.\n\n575\n00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:16.620\nThat becomes my selected point and\nI can move this point in.\n\n576\n00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.080\nSo I can move this here,\nI can move this here.\n\n577\n00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.680\nI can put it there.\n\n578\n00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.800\nAnd so now I actually have a triangle.\n\n579\n00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.130\nSo white is for point, black is for hold.\n\n580\n00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:33.930\nAnd I can make some very\ninteresting shapes like that.\n\n581\n00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:38.990\nAll right and then one last thing with the\nrectangle because it will come up on some\n\n582\n00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.680\nother tools cuz you're probably wondering\nwell you went over almost every single\n\n583\n00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.760\ndot that's on this rectangle except those\nlittle circle things in the corners.\n\n584\n00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.600\nThis is actually something newer to CC.\n\n585\n00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.855\nThese are known as live corners.\n\n586\n00:29:55.194 --> 00:29:56.420\n>> Right here?\nYeah, right there.\n\n587\n00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.000\nThese little guys.\n\n588\n00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.610\nThat?\n\n589\n00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:59.890\nThat's what you're looking at, yeah.\n\n590\n00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.310\nSo those little,\nlooks like an eyeball almost or something.\n\n591\n00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.980\nSo we've got these little guys.\n\n592\n00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.310\nThese are our live corners.\n\n593\n00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.730\nThis is where you could take this\nlive corner, click, hold, and\n\n594\n00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:14.470\ndrag, and make rounded corners on the fly.\n\n595\n00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:19.520\nWhich was kind of not as\neasy to do back in the day.\n\n596\n00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.920\nYou had to do like effects and\nall these different things.\n\n597\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.390\nSo this is kind of a newer feature and\nit is all like that.\n\n598\n00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.420\nNow you can see that it's moving together.\n\n599\n00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.410\nRight.\nThey're all moving at once.\n\n600\n00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:36.395\nBut, what if I wanted to maybe just change\nthe roundness, the cornerness as it were.\n\n601\n00:30:36.395 --> 00:30:38.430\n[LAUGH] The corners of just this one.\n\n602\n00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:42.120\nIf you select, click, hold,\ndrag as well, click it again.\n\n603\n00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.040\nClick once and you see how it almost\nmakes it a little darker versus that one.\n\n604\n00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.710\nSo this is the darker one, which means\nthat this is the only one that it's going\n\n605\n00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:55.320\nto be affecting when I click, hold, and\ndrag in, so I can just make that one\n\n606\n00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.010\ncorner different than the other one,\nwhich is pretty fun.\n\n607\n00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.838\nAll right, so\nI think that's probably enough for now and\n\n608\n00:31:03.838 --> 00:31:06.246\nwe can go over the rest of the tools.\n\n609\n00:31:06.246 --> 00:31:09.349\n>> All right Bon, I know we've got more\nshapes to go over, but unfortunately,\n\n610\n00:31:09.349 --> 00:31:12.404\nwe're out of time for this episode so\nwe're gonna have to wait for part two,\n\n611\n00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:15.353\nwhich means you guys are gonna have to\nmake sure you come back and join us.\n\n612\n00:31:15.353 --> 00:31:17.770\nSo that's gonna do it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n613\n00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.510\nWe hope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n614\n00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.120\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n615\n00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.800\n>> I'm Bon Smith.\n\n616\n00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.056\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n617\n00:31:25.056 --> 00:31:31.680\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.925\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:20.694\nToday, we are doing\nAdobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:25.058\nSpecifically in this episode, we're\nactually continuing a thought process on\n\n6\n00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:28.470\ncreating basic shapes and\ndoing some basic formatting.\n\n7\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.300\nThis is part two so if you missed\npart one you should go back and\n\n8\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.010\nwatch that and then come back and\njoin us for part two.\n\n9\n00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.000\nHere, as always, is Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.830\nHow's it going, Von?\n\n11\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.798\n>> Good.\n\n12\n00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:41.594\nI had so much I had to tell you guys in\nthe first part that I had to come back for\n\n13\n00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:43.440\npart two we're gonna-\n>> Yeah, we like it.\n\n14\n00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.560\nWe're gonna keep on moving,\nkeep on trucking, we\n\n15\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.045\nwere going over rectangles and I thought\nwe would actually get a lot farther.\n\n16\n00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:51.658\nAgain, I had so much to tell you about.\n\n17\n00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:52.838\n>> That's great information.\n\n18\n00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:57.704\n>> Yes, so lots of good things, so let's\nkeep on going with these good things and\n\n19\n00:00:57.704 --> 00:00:58.310\nmove on.\n\n20\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.580\nI actually have the exact file that\nI left off on, from the part one.\n\n21\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.778\nSo we've got these really, really\nawesome looking things going on here.\n\n22\n00:01:07.778 --> 00:01:11.149\n[LAUGH] So I want to basically\njust wipe the slate clean and\n\n23\n00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.880\nmove on to our other shapes.\n\n24\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.690\nSo I'm going to do a Cmd+A or\nCtrl+A for select all, all right?\n\n25\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.690\nAnd that's also in your Edit menu.\n\n26\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.230\nIf you ever want, no, I lied,\n\n27\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.050\nthat's in the Select menu,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.180\n>> Wrong one.\n\n29\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.430\nSo your Select menu would probably be\nwhere you want to Select All on there.\n\n30\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.510\nSo, I did that, and I'm just gonna get rid\nof it, so I'm just gonna hit the Delete\n\n31\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.360\nkey, or the Backspace key, to say okay,\nwe're done, we're gonna move on.\n\n32\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.840\nAll right, so, brand new file,\nit's not really a brand new file.\n\n33\n00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.550\n>> Clean slate though.\n\n34\n00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.794\n>> Thank you, there we go.\n\n35\n00:01:39.794 --> 00:01:42.070\n>> Yes, and now we can give the other\nshapes the attention they so deserve.\n\n36\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.754\n>> Yes, because they've been\nreally wanting to come out and\n\n37\n00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:46.610\nshow you what they can do.\n\n38\n00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.344\nSo Rounded Rectangle Tool,\nit almost explains itself.\n\n39\n00:01:49.344 --> 00:01:51.046\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:51.751\n>> Yeah, it's gonna be\n\n41\n00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:52.830\na rounded rectangle.\n\n42\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.160\nSo then they go.\n\n43\n00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.910\nAnd it's already got the little\ndots that we were doing for\n\n44\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.210\nthe live corners already there.\n\n45\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.750\nIt's a tool that's always been there, so\n\n46\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.970\nit's like they can't really get\nrid of the rounded rectangle tool.\n\n47\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.213\n>> Really don't need it as much any more\nsince you've got the live corners on\n\n48\n00:02:06.213 --> 00:02:07.536\nthe normal rectangle?\n\n49\n00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:09.260\n>> Yeah, it kind of is.\n\n50\n00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.590\nWe'll keep it in there,\nit can do some things for us.\n\n51\n00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.863\nIt's got some predetermined\nroundness to it.\n\n52\n00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:16.590\nOkay, good.\n\n53\n00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.615\nSee?\nLook at how fast that tool was.\n\n54\n00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:22.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> All the other things still apply to it.\n\n55\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.430\nWe can grab a corner and\n\n56\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.580\nwe can hold down Shift to constrain it or\nAlt to pull it from the middle.\n\n57\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.810\n>> Exactly and Shift, and\nAlt is all still applied here.\n\n58\n00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.770\nMaybe I'll use it on the other\none just to demonstrate.\n\n59\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.620\nCuz I kinda forgot about those for\nright now.\n\n60\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.301\nSo I can kinda move these around.\n\n61\n00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:39.640\nYep, everything is the exact same.\n\n62\n00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.510\nIt's just a different tool to create\na different predetermined closed path.\n\n63\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.240\n>> Okay, so the path is different but\nit still has a fill,\n\n64\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.150\nstill has a stroke,\nall the same properties everything.\n\n65\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.027\n>> Yep, we can make this blue and,\nwell, that's green,\n\n66\n00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:57.250\nor whatever color you feel like doing and,\nthere you go.\n\n67\n00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.715\nSo, let's take all those little\nrounded rectangles guys off and\n\n68\n00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:02.830\nlet's go to the circle tool.\n\n69\n00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.710\nSo with circle tools, same idea.\n\n70\n00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.720\nI can hold my Alt key and go from the\ncenter so I'll just click hold and drag.\n\n71\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.160\nI can hold that Shift key to go ahead\nmake that constrained proportions,\n\n72\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.440\nmake a perfect circle.\n\n73\n00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.030\nWhen you're holding down your keys one\nlittle thing you should always let go of\n\n74\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.720\nyour mouse first before\nyou let go of the keys.\n\n75\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.997\nI do it almost the same, but when you're\nfirst starting out, I know people, they're\n\n76\n00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:30.118\nconcentrating so much, and they'll let go\nof the keys and then let go of the mouse.\n\n77\n00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:31.460\nAnd it's like, what just happened?\n\n78\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.080\nIt's not remembering, it's not completing\nthe thought, if you want to say,\n\n79\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.010\nwhen you let go of the mouse.\n\n80\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.830\nSo just kinda be aware of that\nwhen you first start out.\n\n81\n00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.800\nAfter a while it just\nbecomes second nature.\n\n82\n00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.720\nYou don't even think about it really,\nit just happens.\n\n83\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.414\nSo we've got all of our wonderful circles.\n\n84\n00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:52.977\nOne thing that I would like to show\nyou about the circle tool particularly\n\n85\n00:03:52.977 --> 00:03:59.771\nis that it's got some some new icons\nin it that weren't there before in CC.\n\n86\n00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:02.990\nAnd it almost is like the Pac-Man,\nit's the pie making tool or\n\n87\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.893\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n88\n00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:08.104\nI honestly don't know its real name,\nit just makes it a pie.\n\n89\n00:04:08.104 --> 00:04:12.819\nSo you can see that right here on any\ncircle on the right hand side there's\n\n90\n00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.560\nthis little notch sticking out.\n\n91\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.310\nRight there.\n\n92\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.610\nSo that little guy right there,\nthat's my handle for\n\n93\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.370\nwhen you hover over it actually\nputs like a little Pac-Man.\n\n94\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.930\nI'm referring to it to a Pac-Man but it's\na little pie guy, and if you click, hold,\n\n95\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.605\nand drag, you can actually open\nup the circle to make well,\n\n96\n00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:36.110\na pie pr a Pac-Man.\n\n97\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.980\n>> Which before we would have\nhad to create another shape and\n\n98\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.910\ntry to cut it out.\n\n99\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.968\n>> Yeah, you would have to go into\nmore advanced Shape combinations to-\n\n100\n00:04:45.968 --> 00:04:47.025\n>> Merging paths.\n\n101\n00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:51.536\n>> Yes, yes, which we can go over with\nthe path finder panel, so [LAUGH].\n\n102\n00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:54.205\nGood segue into advanced modifications.\n\n103\n00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:56.695\nAnd so\nyou can kinda change things like that.\n\n104\n00:04:56.695 --> 00:05:01.328\nYou also have the same\ncorner modification but\n\n105\n00:05:01.328 --> 00:05:05.023\nthere's some newer guys in the top.\n\n106\n00:05:05.023 --> 00:05:09.140\nThere's like this little circle guy,\nwe got right here, hold on here we go.\n\n107\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.620\nThat guy right there,\nit's a different icon.\n\n108\n00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.740\nI think it's just indicating that\nyou have a pie circle going on,\n\n109\n00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.800\nor actually just kinda saying\nthat you're on just the one side\n\n110\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.200\nof the circle rather than\njust the two pointed arrows.\n\n111\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.610\nSo there's just some new guys.\n\n112\n00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.570\nThis is the one that I wanted to show you\nthough here is on the right hand side,\n\n113\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.930\nit's got these kinda little\ncircle-y dot things.\n\n114\n00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.735\nAnd you see how it's gonna just\nchange the shape of that pie,\n\n115\n00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:38.474\nkeep it in that center and\nyou can kinda move it in like that.\n\n116\n00:05:38.474 --> 00:05:44.210\nSo some kinda newer mouse\npointer icons that you'll see.\n\n117\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.011\nAnd notice that I'm actually changing it\nfrom that new icon is keeping it center so\n\n118\n00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:52.952\nit doesn't even have to\nbe like a pie guy or\n\n119\n00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:55.998\nnot is just let's size it from the center.\n\n120\n00:05:55.998 --> 00:05:58.685\nSo it's actually your shortcut for\ninstead of holding Alt,\n\n121\n00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:00.640\nyou can actually go to\nthat right hand side.\n\n122\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.540\nI'm still the old school mentality\nthat that's just where I go to\n\n123\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.560\nchange is the corner,\nhold Alt then you re-size from the center.\n\n124\n00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.770\n>> Do you still get your rotation?\n\n125\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.250\nI know with a circle, a rotation\nwouldn't make a lot of sense but\n\n126\n00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.700\nonce I put that pie shape out of there,\nnow rotation might come in handy.\n\n127\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.515\n>> Or if it's not a perfect circle.\n\n128\n00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:21.440\n[LAUGH] like this guy right here.\n\n129\n00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.109\nYes, you can go ahead and\nrotate that anywhere.\n\n130\n00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:29.132\nYeah, a perfect circles isn't\ngoing to matter, but pie's and\n\n131\n00:06:29.132 --> 00:06:33.540\nnon-perfect circles would go ahead and\nbenefit from your rotation.\n\n132\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.268\nAnd you still have your Alt and so\nmaybe I could you know take this and\n\n133\n00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:39.435\nrotate it that way and so and so forth.\n\n134\n00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:42.194\nCuz now we got some little Easter eggs or\nthings like that\n\n135\n00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:43.580\n>> Very good.\n\n136\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.228\n>> Okay, so circle tool, great.\n\n137\n00:06:45.228 --> 00:06:49.364\nCtrl + A or Cmd + A, hit Delete, go away.\n\n138\n00:06:49.364 --> 00:06:51.556\nLets move on.\n\n139\n00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.874\nI'm gonna skip the polygon tool just for\n\n140\n00:06:53.874 --> 00:06:57.290\nnow to go to the star tool because\nthe star tool is super fun.\n\n141\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.500\nEverybody loves the star tool,\nI love stars.\n\n142\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.450\nSo if I click, hold and\ndrag or remember the other way?\n\n143\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.970\nWhat was the other way\nthat I could draw a shape?\n\n144\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.900\nDo you remember?\n\n145\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.300\n>> Click and not drag and\nyou get the dialog box and\n\n146\n00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.250\nyou can fill in the property.\n\n147\n00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.205\n>> Yay.\n\n148\n00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:11.463\nSo yes definitely.\n\n149\n00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:16.431\nAnd I want to kinda point this out for now\nbecause I'm going to show you some options\n\n150\n00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:20.480\nthat you can do with the star tool and\nalso the polygon tool as well.\n\n151\n00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:27.460\nBut you can get the star\ninto a weird looking thing.\n\n152\n00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.530\nIt's great cuz you know how you like,\nyeah, I got it in this funky thing, but\n\n153\n00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.920\nI don't know how to get it back.\n\n154\n00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.960\nSo, I just wanted to point out that\nI'm gonna show you how you can reset\n\n155\n00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.640\nthe default star settings once you\nkinda make it all sorts of weird.\n\n156\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.928\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n157\n00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:44.026\nI'm gonna click, hold, and\ndrag with my star tool, and\n\n158\n00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:45.260\nI'm not gonna let go of my mouse.\n\n159\n00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.716\nThat's the key right here,\nmy mouse button is down.\n\n160\n00:07:48.716 --> 00:07:52.661\nWhile it's down, I'm gonna hit\nthe up arrow key on my keyboard.\n\n161\n00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:55.542\nAnd as soon as I hit the up arrow key,\ndo you see how,\n\n162\n00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:57.561\nooh, we start making more points.\n\n163\n00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:59.221\nOn the star.\n\n164\n00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:02.780\nAnd so, this is where people like just\nhold the up arrow and like, yeah!.\n\n165\n00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.040\nSo just keep on going and\nthat's kind of fun.\n\n166\n00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.698\nThat's great.\n\n167\n00:08:05.698 --> 00:08:11.221\nNow I'm going to let go for here, just to\nshow you that I just made like a soupy,\n\n168\n00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:14.430\nsoup soupy super multi-pointed star here.\n\n169\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.880\nAnd if I click, hold and drag again,\n\n170\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.530\nit's gonna remember those\nlast settings that I had set.\n\n171\n00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.920\nSo that's why it's always, you can\nstart getting like so far from center,\n\n172\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.300\nif you want to say that you\ndon't know how to get back and\n\n173\n00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.660\nyou don't know the settings to start with.\n\n174\n00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.860\nBut i'll get you there.\n\n175\n00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.540\nI'm gonna just delete, so\nyou can kinda get a better idea.\n\n176\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.345\nI'm gonna start again, I'm gonna click,\nhold and drag, so there's another thing\n\n177\n00:08:37.345 --> 00:08:41.080\nyou can do while holding that mouse\ndown as if you hold the control or\n\n178\n00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.483\ncommand key while I'm still\nholding the mouse and drag out,\n\n179\n00:08:44.483 --> 00:08:48.510\nyou see how you can actually extend\nthe legs, as I call it, of the star?\n\n180\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.290\n>> Without resizing\nthe circle in the center.\n\n181\n00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:56.040\n>> Yeah, you make longer rays or legs or\nwhatever you wanna call the Now,\n\n182\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.180\nI'm gonna let go here, of my mouse.\n\n183\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.986\nI'm also gonna change the color of it, so\nyou can gonna see how that it goes there.\n\n184\n00:09:03.986 --> 00:09:04.620\nYeah.\n\n185\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.290\nIt's pretty.\nSo\n\n186\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:10.180\nthat's where you name when you start\ngo ahead and making some other stars.\n\n187\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.910\nYou can get to where, you've got it so\n\n188\n00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:17.510\nout of what that you don't\nreally know how to get it back.\n\n189\n00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.880\nWell, you can if you know all the tricks.\n\n190\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.280\nIf you just don't hold your mouse.\n\n191\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.320\nHit the down arrow key, because if you can\nincrease the legs or the number of points,\n\n192\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.760\nyou can decrease it.\n\n193\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.250\nAnd then, if you hold your control key.\n\n194\n00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.760\nSo I can do all of these things while\nI keep that mouse pointer down,\n\n195\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.200\nor the mouse cursor.\n\n196\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.480\nMouse button, sorry.\n\n197\n00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.970\nThe mouse button down.\n\n198\n00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.490\nAnd so if you, you can get it\nback to where it's like, okay,\n\n199\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.040\nthat's kind of normal.\n\n200\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.478\nThat's good, maybe a little bit okay\nthere, there's my perfect star again.\n\n201\n00:09:47.478 --> 00:09:51.230\nAnd so you can get it back by just\nkind of messing around with those.\n\n202\n00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:56.790\nBut if you get it really far off,\nlike let's just kind of go crazy and\n\n203\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.700\ngo here and just kind of do this.\n\n204\n00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.420\nAnd then the next time you draw it,\nit's just this weird thing like that,\n\n205\n00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.396\nwhich actually,\nI think is kind of cool looking.\n\n206\n00:10:06.396 --> 00:10:07.970\n[LAUGH]\n>> It really is.\n\n207\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.750\n>> But with the star tool,\nif you click, you can reset it but\n\n208\n00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.870\nthe basic premise is that your radius 1\nis always double what your radius 2 is.\n\n209\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.688\nOkay, so you could do four and\ntwo or you can do two and one.\n\n210\n00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:25.330\nOr you can do one and .5 and\nI think you got the idea.\n\n211\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.400\nYou just half the radius two, and\nthen the five of the points and\n\n212\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.350\nthat will create like close\nenough to a perfect star.\n\n213\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:40.440\nAnd then it just went ahead and\ndecided to go back to that, but [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.210\nYou get the idea.\n\n215\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.020\nJust half it that will\nget you on your way.\n\n216\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:44.930\nSo\n>> Very good\n\n217\n00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.430\n>> That's\n\n218\n00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.950\n>> Always good to know because, you know,\n\n219\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.700\nyou do get a little crazy sometimes\nplaying around with those then,\n\n220\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.720\nyou just need that basic star again and\n\n221\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.900\nrather than have to remember how to\nundo each thing I did, just reset.\n\n222\n00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.400\n>> Exactly.\n\n223\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.890\nSo, and you can do this same\nthing with the polygon tool.\n\n224\n00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.770\nThe polygon start off with just the,\nthat's a six, that's a hexagon, right?\n\n225\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.140\nAnd you can keep the alt to the shift and\ndo all that stuff, but\n\n226\n00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.040\nif your mouse cursor,\n[LAUGH] gosh I keep saying cursor.\n\n227\n00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.590\nIf my mouse button is down,\nI can use the up and down arrows to create\n\n228\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.710\nthe different number of\nsides on my polygon.\n\n229\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.514\nSo now the control doesn't\nreally do anything here,\n\n230\n00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.291\nbecause it doesn't have like legs and\npoints, so.\n\n231\n00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:25.090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n232\n00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.970\nI wanted at least show you the up and\ndown arrows.\n\n233\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.960\nThat's the polygon tool.\n\n234\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.395\nNow this last one, the flare tool.\n\n235\n00:11:32.395 --> 00:11:36.593\nThe flare tool is just a flare tool.\n\n236\n00:11:36.593 --> 00:11:39.190\nThere are actually reasons\nwhy you can do it.\n\n237\n00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.086\nI've actually looked up tutorials like,\nwhy would you use the flare tool?\n\n238\n00:11:42.086 --> 00:11:43.694\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Besides making some really cool\n\n239\n00:11:43.694 --> 00:11:45.550\nlooking things.\n\n240\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.990\nIt's, let me just do it.\n\n241\n00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.250\nSo the first flare is,\nI'm just going to click, hold and drag and\n\n242\n00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.440\nI make this kind of little starburst thing\nand it makes this like brown dot thing.\n\n243\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.300\nThat's one.\nAnd then the next one that you drag,\n\n244\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:03.400\nif I click hold and drag, it's making this\nkind of drop, do you know like, sunflares?\n\n245\n00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.100\n>> Yeah, it's trying to Imitate on a\npicture or you got the glare from the sun,\n\n246\n00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.190\nor bright light or\nstreet light or something.\n\n247\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.968\n>> Hm-mm, you see, I seen in commercials\nlike for cars that are driving and\n\n248\n00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:18.376\nlike they're driving by\nthe nice meadow and [NOISE].\n\n249\n00:12:18.376 --> 00:12:21.567\nIt's the little dots down from the sun\nthat's like catching your eye and\n\n250\n00:12:21.567 --> 00:12:22.750\nit's so pretty.\n\n251\n00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.420\nAnd that's.\n\n252\n00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.548\nThat is what it's trying to do.\n\n253\n00:12:25.548 --> 00:12:27.380\nNow, when it's just by itself.\n\n254\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.180\nI'm on a blank piece of paper right here.\n\n255\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:34.329\nYou just start making these kind\nof amazing looking psychedelic,\n\n256\n00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:37.650\ntrippy [LAUGHS] that's fun, right.\n\n257\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.290\nIt just looks like this celestial\nbeing poster or something like that.\n\n258\n00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.000\nSo by itself,\nthey are kind of neat looking.\n\n259\n00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.930\nAnd I just did a control error command and\nhit Delete.\n\n260\n00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.630\nSo you could always kinda play around\nwith that, but let me show you,\n\n261\n00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.750\nwhere you might see it\na little bit better.\n\n262\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.790\nIt is on a colored square here,\n\n263\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.780\nand I take my flare tool and\nI draw flares on top of it.\n\n264\n00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.585\nYou see how it's not really, oops,\nthose are the options of the flare tool.\n\n265\n00:13:10.585 --> 00:13:13.096\nBut, why are you doing that?\n\n266\n00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:14.900\nThere we go.\n\n267\n00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.621\nSo you can see that once you\nkind of create that, stop.\n\n268\n00:13:18.621 --> 00:13:20.220\n[LAUGH].\n\n269\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.930\nIt's white, it's not really brown.\n\n270\n00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:29.680\nAnd if I change the color of the square,\n\n271\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:37.390\nyou can see it's just really kind\nof making these flares in this guy.\n\n272\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.840\nSo and\nI don't know my libraries just came up.\n\n273\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.330\n>> That's actually really cool, because\nyou can imagine trying to create one of\n\n274\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.440\nthese from scratch with all the different\nshapes that are involved in that.\n\n275\n00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.770\nCould be a very tedious process and\n\n276\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.640\nnow you can do it with just a click and\na drag.\n\n277\n00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.764\n>> Yeah, and\nit creates cool looking graphics.\n\n278\n00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:52.004\n>> Mm-hm, it really does.\n\n279\n00:13:52.004 --> 00:13:56.152\n>> So you can just add a little\npiece of flare to your artwork.\n\n280\n00:13:56.152 --> 00:13:58.176\n>> [LAUGH] Gotta have pieces of flare.\n\n281\n00:13:58.176 --> 00:13:59.890\n>> Gotta have at least five.\n\n282\n00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:00.815\n>> That's right.\n\n283\n00:14:00.815 --> 00:14:03.060\n[LAUGH]\n>> At least five pieces of flare.\n\n284\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:09.520\n[LAUGH] Okay, anyways, so\nwe just went over all of the closed path.\n\n285\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.154\nI don't think the flares was\nactually a closed path but\n\n286\n00:14:13.154 --> 00:14:13.874\nit is\n>> Included there.\n\n287\n00:14:13.874 --> 00:14:15.620\n>> In the shape group,\nso we should go there.\n\n288\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.330\n>> I have a question for\n\n289\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.360\nyou, so I saw like with the rectangle or\nthe square tool, you were able to\n\n290\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.570\ntake one of those corners with the white\narea drag it in make a triangle.\n\n291\n00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.380\nYou're also able to take your polygon\ntool and drop a number of size, so\n\n292\n00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.350\nyou have a triangle.\n\n293\n00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.470\nAny difference between this two end\nup with the triangle either way.\n\n294\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.750\n>> True.\nYou can exactly.\n\n295\n00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.740\nYou can take your polygon tool and\n\n296\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.850\ndrop the number of side down to\nmake a triangle and there you go.\n\n297\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.320\nAnd, just so you know,\n\n298\n00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.670\nyou do have this little guy here to make\nyour rounded, your live corners in that.\n\n299\n00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.050\nI wasn't completely pointing that\nout in some of the other ones, but\n\n300\n00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.360\nI can go back and show you.\n\n301\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.470\nSo you can do that.\n\n302\n00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.400\nNow, I guess the biggest\ndifference would be,\n\n303\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.480\nthat if I did this polygon right,\nwith three sides versus the square.\n\n304\n00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.960\nAnd then I take my white arrow tool,\ncuz we wanna take the white arrow tool,\n\n305\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.900\nI clicked off everything first,\nso you could see this.\n\n306\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.660\nAnd I select this point,\nhow many points are on a square?\n\n307\n00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.160\n>> Four.\n\n308\n00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.080\n>> Four.\nHow many points are on a triangle?\n\n309\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.780\n>> Three.\n\n310\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.640\n>> Three.\n\n311\n00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.770\nSo.\n\n312\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:19.530\nYou really-\n>> So\n\n313\n00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.130\neven though you've made a triangle shape,\nit still has four points.\n\n314\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.610\nThere's one somewhere in\nthe middle of one of those legs.\n\n315\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.090\n>> Correct.\n\n316\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.130\nVisually, is it gonna make any difference?\n\n317\n00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:28.680\nNo.\n\n318\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.140\nI mean, Oops, I just did it the wrong way.\n\n319\n00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.170\nSo I'm gonna take that.\n\n320\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:35.640\nAnd if I did here, there is my\ntriangle and then I can move it.\n\n321\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.590\nBut so see how I'd have to actually\ntake this and move it here.\n\n322\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.600\nHere I just have three points.\n\n323\n00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.720\nOne, two, three.\n\n324\n00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:45.680\nNow.\n\n325\n00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.488\n>> Yes.\n>> You've actually kind of gone on to,\n\n326\n00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:50.404\nwell, then can I get rid of that\nother point in this four point.\n\n327\n00:15:50.404 --> 00:15:51.344\n>> We won't go that far.\n\n328\n00:15:51.344 --> 00:15:52.946\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll save that.\n\n329\n00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:54.027\nWe'll leave a cliff hanger.\n\n330\n00:15:54.027 --> 00:15:54.711\n>> A little teaser.\n\n331\n00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:55.651\n>> Yes.\n\n332\n00:15:55.651 --> 00:15:56.546\nYeah, you can.\n\n333\n00:15:56.546 --> 00:15:59.080\nYou can delete points, and\nthat's all with the pen tool and\n\n334\n00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.968\nwe'll cover the pen\ntool a little bit more.\n\n335\n00:16:00.968 --> 00:16:01.936\nOkay, very good.\nBut you can use it.\n\n336\n00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:05.108\nDelete Anchor Point Tool, if you wanna\ngo searching for it right now, so\n\n337\n00:16:05.108 --> 00:16:06.358\nthat's where you can do it.\n\n338\n00:16:06.358 --> 00:16:10.792\nBut that would be\nthe significant difference.\n\n339\n00:16:10.792 --> 00:16:12.720\n>> All right, so let's take a look at,\n\n340\n00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.100\nwe've taken a look at these closed path\ntools and that's really where the path\n\n341\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.030\nends up where it started so you end\nup with a fill because it's closed.\n\n342\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.467\nBut, we also have a bunch of tools that\nmake open paths where the ends don't\n\n343\n00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:26.705\ntouch, and\nyou don't get a fill out of that, but\n\n344\n00:16:26.705 --> 00:16:28.358\nyou still have stroke properties.\n\n345\n00:16:28.358 --> 00:16:30.770\n>> Mm-hm, you were listening, good job.\n\n346\n00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, yes,\n\n347\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.000\nlet's go over the open path tools.\n\n348\n00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.128\nThis line segment tool right here,\nis your line segment tool.\n\n349\n00:16:40.128 --> 00:16:44.018\nThe things, notice up here in\nMy Properties before I even start,\n\n350\n00:16:44.018 --> 00:16:47.450\nI have a purple fill and\nI have a black stroke.\n\n351\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.987\nWell, when I click, hold, and drag, and\nmake this line, there's no purple there.\n\n352\n00:16:51.987 --> 00:16:53.070\n>> Right.\n\n353\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.960\n>> Like you said, there is no fill.\n\n354\n00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.723\nOkay, there is no fill.\n\n355\n00:16:56.723 --> 00:16:57.763\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n356\n00:16:57.763 --> 00:17:00.443\n>> So, you just have stroke properties.\n\n357\n00:17:00.443 --> 00:17:07.390\nAnd actually it deferrals back to its\ndefault settings of no fill black stroke.\n\n358\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.709\nOne thing to start thinking\nabout when you do,\n\n359\n00:17:10.709 --> 00:17:15.728\nactually any path whether it's open and\nclose, if you come up here and\n\n360\n00:17:15.728 --> 00:17:20.491\nthere's a none in your stroke, and\nthere's a none in your fill and\n\n361\n00:17:20.491 --> 00:17:24.858\nyou start drawing stuff and\nyou're like why am I [CROSSTALK].\n\n362\n00:17:24.858 --> 00:17:28.298\nYeah, you come back over your\nrectangle tool, and you're like, why?\n\n363\n00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:29.870\nWhat's going on here?\n\n364\n00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.016\nI'm gonna do that Ctrl + A to show you,\nthere are a whole bunch of paths in here.\n\n365\n00:17:33.016 --> 00:17:33.876\n>> Wow.\n\n366\n00:17:33.876 --> 00:17:35.900\n>> And remember that Ctrl + Y?\n\n367\n00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.998\nCtrl + Y is to go into\nOutline Mode in the View Menu.\n\n368\n00:17:40.998 --> 00:17:43.878\nYou see like in Outline Mode,\nit is showing you, there are paths.\n\n369\n00:17:43.878 --> 00:17:46.040\nYou did create, paths exist there.\n\n370\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.195\nThey just don't have any fill or\nany stroke, so to you,\n\n371\n00:17:49.195 --> 00:17:50.748\nit looks like it's blank.\n\n372\n00:17:50.748 --> 00:17:51.408\nOkay, so,\n\n373\n00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:54.881\nanother reason why I always like-\n>> If the path is still there, that could\n\n374\n00:17:54.881 --> 00:17:58.288\ncause problems, interactions with other\nshapes possibly, or stacking orders.\n\n375\n00:17:58.288 --> 00:17:59.388\n>> Mm-hm, it does exist.\n\n376\n00:17:59.388 --> 00:18:03.420\n>> Wow, [LAUGHS]\n>> There are paths there.\n\n377\n00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.370\nSo that Preview Mode is really great\nto double check with everything, and\n\n378\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.710\nI always like to do a Ctrl + A too,\nbecause then I can kind of pick up,\n\n379\n00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.370\nit's actually showing me things\nthat are selected that I don't see.\n\n380\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:21.100\nAnd then you can always come to here and\njust throw a black stroke on everything,\n\n381\n00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.380\nso then when I click off of this,\nI can see, yep, they do exist.\n\n382\n00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.280\n>> Make ease of finding it,\nget rid of it if you need to.\n\n383\n00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.884\n>> Definitely, so\nalways watch your default properties, and\n\n384\n00:18:30.884 --> 00:18:34.426\nif you actually have something\nthere to show you what it is.\n\n385\n00:18:34.426 --> 00:18:39.490\nSo, the line tool, same shift constrain,\nstraight, up and down.\n\n386\n00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:43.220\nAlt from the center versus going\nfrom one side to one side.\n\n387\n00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.380\nSo you have all those same properties\nhere and they do create, like if I create\n\n388\n00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:55.080\nsomething like this, these are four\nseparate paths, this is not one path.\n\n389\n00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.860\nThey are by themselves.\n\n390\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.730\nThey don't touch each other.\n\n391\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:02.380\nEven if I take this, and remember we\ncan go to our white arrow tool, right?\n\n392\n00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.878\nOur white arrow tool for that one point,\nand I could get that there.\n\n393\n00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:08.190\nWhoops, I clicked off the wrong way.\n\n394\n00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:13.278\nOkay, so this right here, this and\nthis, those are two separate paths.\n\n395\n00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:17.730\nIt might look like it's like an L there,\nit's not, it's two separate ones.\n\n396\n00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.150\nSo just, make sure you know\nthat that's what's going on.\n\n397\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:29.110\nLet's go with this art tool, just like\nthe star, you can do some things with it.\n\n398\n00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.088\nIf you click, hold, and drag.\n\n399\n00:19:30.088 --> 00:19:32.390\nYou see,\nit's making some kind of an ark here.\n\n400\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.719\nKeeping the mouse held down,\narrow up, arrow down,\n\n401\n00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:41.638\nyou see how it's actually changing\nlike the bend in the arc.\n\n402\n00:19:41.638 --> 00:19:44.818\nSo you can kind of make it more like that.\n\n403\n00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:45.540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n404\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.710\n>> Instead of curvy.\n\n405\n00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:54.990\nSo that's kind of a cute little shortcut\nor modification you can do with Arc Tool.\n\n406\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.978\nAnd then the spiral tool.\n\n407\n00:19:57.978 --> 00:19:59.270\nI really love the spiral tool.\n\n408\n00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:04.377\nThis is another that can get very,\nit can get out of hand really quickly,\n\n409\n00:20:04.377 --> 00:20:09.233\nso before I start, you should write\nthis down, I actually have it for\n\n410\n00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:11.278\nyou guys to be able to see it.\n\n411\n00:20:11.278 --> 00:20:16.034\nYou always want to start off with\na .6944 inch radius, 80% decay and\n\n412\n00:20:16.034 --> 00:20:19.155\n10 segment, and\na left swirly thing selected,\n\n413\n00:20:19.155 --> 00:20:23.096\nbecause that's the default because\nyou can do some cool things\n\n414\n00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:27.730\nwith the Spiral Tool if you hold\nthe mouse down, click, hold, and drag.\n\n415\n00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.690\nHere, let me start over so\nyou can see this a little better.\n\n416\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.190\nClick, hold, and drag,\ndon't let go of the mouse.\n\n417\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:37.700\nIf I hold the Control or Command key, hold\nthat down, move your mouse in, you see\n\n418\n00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:43.030\nhow it actually kind of constricts, if you\nwant to say, the space between the lines,\n\n419\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.620\nI'm not letting go of my mouse,\nbut I'm letting go of the control.\n\n420\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.248\nThen might use my up arrow, here, you\nsee how I can [SOUND] go on down there.\n\n421\n00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:56.370\nAnd then you can hold the control,\nmake it more spaced, less spaced.\n\n422\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.495\nPeople they start going crazy in here and\nthey start going all these crazy segment,\n\n423\n00:21:01.495 --> 00:21:03.618\nand you're like yeah, and that's cute.\n\n424\n00:21:03.618 --> 00:21:05.329\nAnd then you go to the next one, and\n\n425\n00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:08.471\npeople get it all to where it's\njust like this one little hoop.\n\n426\n00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:10.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I have no idea what I did.\n\n427\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.450\nI'm like yeah, you just went crazy\nwith all these modifications.\n\n428\n00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:17.373\nSo if you just keep that default setting\nsomewhere handy in the back of your mind,\n\n429\n00:21:17.373 --> 00:21:19.678\nor if you really wanted\nto completely reset it,\n\n430\n00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:23.570\nbecause you could start a new file,\nit's still gonna stay.\n\n431\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.148\n>> You have to close\nIllustrator all the way down.\n\n432\n00:21:25.148 --> 00:21:27.004\n>> Okay.\n>> And then open Illustrator back up and\n\n433\n00:21:27.004 --> 00:21:28.064\nthen it will reset.\n\n434\n00:21:28.064 --> 00:21:28.840\n>> Wow.\n\n435\n00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.960\n>> So, it's not like an easy reset.\n\n436\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.548\nSo, unless you know the numbers.\n\n437\n00:21:33.548 --> 00:21:34.828\n>> Which we do now, thanks to you.\n\n438\n00:21:34.828 --> 00:21:35.994\n>> Yes, yes, good.\n\n439\n00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:38.566\nIt's always a good reference,\nI think ahead for you guys.\n\n440\n00:21:38.566 --> 00:21:43.114\nThe last two here rectangular\ngrid tool and polar grid,\n\n441\n00:21:43.114 --> 00:21:49.010\nthey're just grid tools and\nyou can use them some kind of fun ways.\n\n442\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.650\nFor right now,\nwe're just gonna create them.\n\n443\n00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.568\nIf you just click, hold,\nand drag with that.\n\n444\n00:21:52.568 --> 00:21:55.978\nDon't let go of the mouse, because,\nwell, let me just do it first.\n\n445\n00:21:55.978 --> 00:21:57.710\nNow, don't let go of the mouse.\n\n446\n00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.160\nUp arrow will create more rows.\n\n447\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.320\nLeft and right create more columns,\nor less columns.\n\n448\n00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:12.350\nSo, I can create just a few,\ncouple more, so up, down,\n\n449\n00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:17.380\nleft, right controls your rows and your\ncolumns of your rectangular grid tool.\n\n450\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.330\nAnd then you can do fun\nthings like Live Paint.\n\n451\n00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.300\nOr, you can actually\nmake grids out of them,\n\n452\n00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.140\nwhen we go over grids in\nanother episode as well.\n\n453\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.260\nWhen you make a rectangle grid or\n\n454\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.440\na polar grid, might as well go over\nthat before I tell you what they are,\n\n455\n00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.930\nThey're gonna be groups,\nthey're made into groups by default.\n\n456\n00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.235\n>> Okay.\n\n457\n00:22:42.235 --> 00:22:46.520\n>> So, let's do the polar grid, so\nif I click, hold, and drag, same idea.\n\n458\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.160\nUp arrow, more rings.\n\n459\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.360\nLeft and right arrow, more pie pieces.\n\n460\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.910\nSo maybe less and a few things there.\n\n461\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.408\nAnd hold the Shift key,\nlet go, and then it's there.\n\n462\n00:22:58.408 --> 00:23:01.790\nBut notice over here it does say,\ngroup, okay?\n\n463\n00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.530\nThis is a group, this is a group.\n\n464\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.540\nIt's just the way the tool works.\n\n465\n00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:11.304\nSo if you can have something that is\na group, you can also ungroup it,\n\n466\n00:23:11.304 --> 00:23:15.116\nokay, which is Cltr + Shift + G,\nor Cmd + Shift + G.\n\n467\n00:23:15.116 --> 00:23:18.250\nAnd once I've ungrouped it,\nI have to click off it,\n\n468\n00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.060\nbecause it always still\nremembers all the pieces so\n\n469\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:26.400\nyou can see that this is\nactually separate than this.\n\n470\n00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.850\nBut now this, that's a group as well.\n\n471\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.110\n>> Wow.\n>> It's telling me up there.\n\n472\n00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:33.320\nSo if I ungroup this again,\nclick off of it,\n\n473\n00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.540\nand now I can see I've got\nall of these different path.\n\n474\n00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:43.372\nSo you can break it down, if you needed\nto, by creating it and then grouping it.\n\n475\n00:23:43.372 --> 00:23:46.461\n>> So it's made up of several\ndifferent paths grouped together, and\n\n476\n00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:48.899\nthen grouping it then allows\nus to treat it as a unit.\n\n477\n00:23:48.899 --> 00:23:50.222\nAnd we can create our own groups right?\n\n478\n00:23:50.222 --> 00:23:50.873\n>> We can.\n\n479\n00:23:50.873 --> 00:23:51.662\nYeah, so.\n\n480\n00:23:51.662 --> 00:23:54.239\nPoint, ha ha.\n\n481\n00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:56.421\n>> You're so clever.\n\n482\n00:23:56.421 --> 00:23:57.943\n>> I know, I'm punny.\n\n483\n00:23:57.943 --> 00:23:59.298\nSo we go here.\n\n484\n00:23:59.298 --> 00:24:05.067\nIf I wanted to make my own group,\nlet's just make a couple rectangles.\n\n485\n00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:08.931\nAnd this is a good a learning point\nhere for the black arrow tool,\n\n486\n00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:13.605\nbecause if I want to select this you\nnotice how, what's going on right here?\n\n487\n00:24:13.605 --> 00:24:14.244\nWhat's the problem?\n\n488\n00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:15.184\nWhy can't I select this?\n\n489\n00:24:15.184 --> 00:24:16.183\nThere's no dot.\n\n490\n00:24:16.183 --> 00:24:17.088\n>> We don't have a dot.\n\n491\n00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:18.168\nThere's no dog in the field.\n\n492\n00:24:18.168 --> 00:24:18.946\n>> Exactly.\n\n493\n00:24:18.946 --> 00:24:20.966\nYou got to make sure you find it there.\n\n494\n00:24:20.966 --> 00:24:25.017\nThe other thing is we are selecting\nitems that don't have fills.\n\n495\n00:24:25.017 --> 00:24:28.619\nYou can go into the center, and\nsee when I hover over the center,\n\n496\n00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:31.500\nit actually does end up at\nthe point end of the tail.\n\n497\n00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:36.198\nSo you can get it there, and\nif you stay kind of around that area,\n\n498\n00:24:36.198 --> 00:24:41.418\nit gets the kind of circle dot,\nthe big circle dot at the end of the tail,\n\n499\n00:24:41.418 --> 00:24:44.471\nthere's no tail here and you can move it.\n\n500\n00:24:44.471 --> 00:24:47.246\nBut if you come out here,\nsee how I got the tail back again?\n\n501\n00:24:47.246 --> 00:24:49.081\nNow it's going to not let me do anything,\n\n502\n00:24:49.081 --> 00:24:52.400\nbecause it doesn't recognize that\nI'm over something that is selected.\n\n503\n00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.240\n>> So without the fill you're almost\nlike you're clicking through it and\n\n504\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.399\nclicking behind it.\n\n505\n00:24:57.399 --> 00:25:00.404\n>> Yes, or whatever item is underneath it,\nyes, exactly.\n\n506\n00:25:00.404 --> 00:25:05.040\nSo it can really throw you off, but\nalways watch that mouse cursor icon,\n\n507\n00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.183\nit will help you.\n\n508\n00:25:06.183 --> 00:25:09.992\nOr you just go to the actual stroke,\nor the outside of a path,\n\n509\n00:25:09.992 --> 00:25:11.729\nand you can move it like so.\n\n510\n00:25:11.729 --> 00:25:16.225\nSo let's throw some fills in there so\nit's a little bit easier for\n\n511\n00:25:16.225 --> 00:25:18.452\nme to grab them and move around.\n\n512\n00:25:18.452 --> 00:25:21.323\nSo we're going this way, there we go.\n\n513\n00:25:21.323 --> 00:25:25.997\nSo, if I wanted these guys to be together,\nbecause, see right there?\n\n514\n00:25:25.997 --> 00:25:26.914\nThrow some text on it.\n\n515\n00:25:26.914 --> 00:25:27.761\nThere's a logo.\n\n516\n00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:32.927\n[LAUGH] You go here, you select the item\nthat you want to become a group.\n\n517\n00:25:32.927 --> 00:25:34.110\nSo, select all the items.\n\n518\n00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.088\nIf I can right click the un-group,\nyou can right click the group.\n\n519\n00:25:38.088 --> 00:25:39.380\nYou can also to control+G.\n\n520\n00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.792\nYou could also go into\nyour Object menu and\n\n521\n00:25:42.792 --> 00:25:46.117\nthere's Cmd + G over there on the side.\n\n522\n00:25:46.117 --> 00:25:50.583\nSo I go into Group, and then I've just\nmade a group, and then there you go.\n\n523\n00:25:50.583 --> 00:25:53.908\nOne thing to point here in the layers,\njust to show you, is that,\n\n524\n00:25:53.908 --> 00:25:58.213\ncuz I looked at those before on the other\nepisode, is we've got the three together.\n\n525\n00:25:58.213 --> 00:26:03.420\nIf I expand out this Layer 1, you see how\nit's created, it's like a subset now.\n\n526\n00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.822\nIf I expand out the group, you see how\nthose are the individual layers that\n\n527\n00:26:07.822 --> 00:26:10.594\nare within the group\nthat's within Layer 1.\n\n528\n00:26:10.594 --> 00:26:13.409\nBecause, if I go over here and\nstart making,\n\n529\n00:26:13.409 --> 00:26:17.719\nI'm gonna change the color first\nbefore I start drawing some stars.\n\n530\n00:26:17.719 --> 00:26:21.117\nYou see how all of these\nare underneath Layer 1.\n\n531\n00:26:21.117 --> 00:26:22.790\nCuz they're in the main layer.\n\n532\n00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:27.306\nAnd then the three squares\nare indented a little bit\n\n533\n00:26:27.306 --> 00:26:30.885\nbecause they are all part of that group.\n\n534\n00:26:30.885 --> 00:26:33.041\n>> Fantastic.\nNow once you get this grouped together,\n\n535\n00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:35.367\nthat gives me the ability to\nkinda treat them as a unit.\n\n536\n00:26:35.367 --> 00:26:38.021\nAnd that I can resize\nthe whole thing if I want.\n\n537\n00:26:38.021 --> 00:26:38.577\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n538\n00:26:38.577 --> 00:26:39.716\nYeah, I can move it.\n\n539\n00:26:39.716 --> 00:26:41.318\nSo see I'm just single clicking.\n\n540\n00:26:41.318 --> 00:26:44.719\nI can alt drag to duplicate this.\n\n541\n00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:47.632\nI can It, yeah,\nit's just treating them together,\n\n542\n00:26:47.632 --> 00:26:50.893\nbecause you know that you always\nwant those to be together.\n\n543\n00:26:50.893 --> 00:26:54.577\nI could take these three stars, cuz I\nknow these guys are always gonna need to\n\n544\n00:26:54.577 --> 00:26:56.551\nstay together, so I select those guys.\n\n545\n00:26:56.551 --> 00:26:59.833\nControl or Command G to go ahead and\ndo the groups that way.\n\n546\n00:26:59.833 --> 00:27:03.925\n>> And then as we saw with the polar tool,\nwe can actually group groups as well.\n\n547\n00:27:03.925 --> 00:27:07.499\n>> Mm-hm.\nI could say that these guys right here.\n\n548\n00:27:07.499 --> 00:27:12.393\nSo now, this is my logo or whatever I\nwant, so, I select, just click, hold and\n\n549\n00:27:12.393 --> 00:27:17.219\ndrag there, Control+G there and so now,\nI've got a group inside of a group,\n\n550\n00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:19.949\nwell, two groups inside of another group.\n\n551\n00:27:19.949 --> 00:27:23.074\n>> And then, refresh my memory,\nI think you've told us this once before,\n\n552\n00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:24.508\nbut we can still go in and modify or\n\n553\n00:27:24.508 --> 00:27:27.911\nwork with an individual shape within\nthe group without destroying the group.\n\n554\n00:27:27.911 --> 00:27:28.468\n>> Yes.\n\n555\n00:27:28.468 --> 00:27:31.138\nThere's a couple ways you could do it.\n\n556\n00:27:31.138 --> 00:27:33.183\nThe one I showed you before is,\nyou can just double click.\n\n557\n00:27:33.183 --> 00:27:34.932\nWhen you double click,\nyou go into isolation mode.\n\n558\n00:27:34.932 --> 00:27:35.535\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n559\n00:27:35.535 --> 00:27:38.589\n>> So you can see that right now\nI'm inside the group of layer one.\n\n560\n00:27:38.589 --> 00:27:41.724\nAnd actually,\nsince we're talking about the layers,\n\n561\n00:27:41.724 --> 00:27:45.740\nyou see how I'm in my layers panel,\nit actually shows isolation mode.\n\n562\n00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.624\n>> Nice\n>> So I can come into here, and\n\n563\n00:27:48.624 --> 00:27:53.739\nI can modify, like now I need to\ngo into those purple stars again,\n\n564\n00:27:53.739 --> 00:27:56.808\njust double click here, change that,\n\n565\n00:27:56.808 --> 00:28:01.111\nbecause I'm now inside the group,\ninside the group.\n\n566\n00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:02.956\nMaybe I'll make it a different color,\nI'll make it green.\n\n567\n00:28:02.956 --> 00:28:03.500\nOkay.\n\n568\n00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.860\nAnd if I double click or.\n\n569\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:05.638\nYeah.\n\n570\n00:28:05.638 --> 00:28:07.055\nDouble-click outside,\n\n571\n00:28:07.055 --> 00:28:10.861\nthen I'm coming all the way out of\nisolation mode instead of going up.\n\n572\n00:28:10.861 --> 00:28:13.320\nMight as well throw this in there, because\nwe talked about layers a little bit.\n\n573\n00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.372\nThere is one more other way\nthat you could do this.\n\n574\n00:28:15.372 --> 00:28:21.117\nAnd you can control how you can select and\nmodify things from in your layers panel.\n\n575\n00:28:21.117 --> 00:28:23.464\nIf I expand out this group here, and\n\n576\n00:28:23.464 --> 00:28:27.699\nhere you can see it in the thumbnail\nthat these are my stars here.\n\n577\n00:28:27.699 --> 00:28:28.478\nLittle, oops.\n\n578\n00:28:28.478 --> 00:28:31.697\nSorry, I was trying to\nget to my zoom tool.\n\n579\n00:28:31.697 --> 00:28:34.030\nHod on, let me back up.\n\n580\n00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.177\nOkay.\n\n581\n00:28:37.177 --> 00:28:38.453\nLet's back up a few more times.\n\n582\n00:28:38.453 --> 00:28:39.255\nNow let's redo.\n\n583\n00:28:39.255 --> 00:28:40.636\nThere we go.\nNow we go.\n\n584\n00:28:40.636 --> 00:28:41.878\nSorry, I had to get myself there.\n\n585\n00:28:41.878 --> 00:28:43.875\nI was trying to do this,\nI just hit the wrong key.\n\n586\n00:28:43.875 --> 00:28:45.233\nSo I'm in the layer one.\n\n587\n00:28:45.233 --> 00:28:45.999\nI'm in the group, and I've expanded.\n\n588\n00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:52.456\nSo, there's my purple and\ngreen stars right?\n\n589\n00:28:52.456 --> 00:28:54.184\nOkay, from here I can take,\n\n590\n00:28:54.184 --> 00:28:58.955\nnow if you just single click on the layer\nthat's not actually doing anything.\n\n591\n00:28:58.955 --> 00:29:03.289\nOkay you're just kind of getting into that\nparticular place within the layers panel.\n\n592\n00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:07.294\nThis little circle guy\nover here to the right.\n\n593\n00:29:07.294 --> 00:29:08.676\nRight there.\n\n594\n00:29:08.676 --> 00:29:16.045\nIf you click on that you're actually\nselecting that item on the art board.\n\n595\n00:29:16.045 --> 00:29:20.832\nSo it's kind of a neat way of saying\nI only want to be on that one thing\n\n596\n00:29:20.832 --> 00:29:24.180\nthat's all the way down\nwithin those layers.\n\n597\n00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.540\nSo I click that, I know that I'm on it and\nnow I can just come over here and\n\n598\n00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.914\nI can change this to like,\nred or black, or whatever.\n\n599\n00:29:31.914 --> 00:29:33.795\nSo I don't even have to\ngo into isolation mode.\n\n600\n00:29:33.795 --> 00:29:36.011\nI don't have to go ahead and ungroup.\n\n601\n00:29:36.011 --> 00:29:36.779\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n602\n00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:40.034\nI should select that particular\nthing from the layers panel,\n\n603\n00:29:40.034 --> 00:29:43.237\nby going over to that left hand side and\nclicking the circle.\n\n604\n00:29:43.237 --> 00:29:46.931\n>> In a complex logo, or diagram that\ncould be a lot easier than trying to drill\n\n605\n00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:49.347\ndown through the shape by\ndouble clicking on it.\n\n606\n00:29:49.347 --> 00:29:49.941\n>> Yeah, this is huge.\n\n607\n00:29:49.941 --> 00:29:51.044\nI use this a lot.\n\n608\n00:29:51.044 --> 00:29:53.006\nComplex drawings.\n\n609\n00:29:53.006 --> 00:29:55.559\nYou have layers upon layers and layers,\n\n610\n00:29:55.559 --> 00:30:00.075\njust path after path and there\nare groups and they're all the way down.\n\n611\n00:30:00.075 --> 00:30:04.730\nAnd sometimes, I'll just actually,\nif I'm getting somebody else's work or\n\n612\n00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:08.132\nI just start clicking on\nthe circles on the layers panel and\n\n613\n00:30:08.132 --> 00:30:12.805\nI'm watching what's out there on the art\nboard and seeing what's turning on.\n\n614\n00:30:13.815 --> 00:30:14.395\nThere's that.\n\n615\n00:30:14.395 --> 00:30:16.277\nOkay, now I know what that is.\n\n616\n00:30:16.277 --> 00:30:19.079\nI know that's in a group,\nwithin a group, that's in layer one.\n\n617\n00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:20.078\n>> Wow.\n\n618\n00:30:20.078 --> 00:30:21.274\n>> So\nyou just kinda click up those circles.\n\n619\n00:30:21.274 --> 00:30:22.191\n>> Alright Vaughn.\n\n620\n00:30:22.191 --> 00:30:26.927\nLot of great information there on doing\nsome basic shapes and basic formatting,\n\n621\n00:30:26.927 --> 00:30:29.240\nas well as, some extra tips on layers.\n\n622\n00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.118\nAnd some cool little tricks that\nwe can use in the future and\n\n623\n00:30:32.118 --> 00:30:35.727\nwe'll go over layers and much more\ndepth obviously in future episodes.\n\n624\n00:30:35.727 --> 00:30:37.131\nSo we thank you for that, enjoyed it.\n\n625\n00:30:37.131 --> 00:30:38.641\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n626\n00:30:38.641 --> 00:30:41.764\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n627\n00:30:41.764 --> 00:30:42.704\n>> I'm Vaughn Smith.\n\n628\n00:30:42.704 --> 00:30:43.981\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n629\n00:30:43.981 -->

--> 00:00:20.659\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.811\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be looking\nat how we can arrange and place.\n\n5\n00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:30.340\nAnd order and space and really lay out\nour different objects in Illustrator.\n\n6\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.410\nAnd here to help us, of course,\nis Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.240\nHow's it going Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.070\n>> Great, glad to be back yet\nagain to talk about aligning.\n\n9\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.720\nAnd gridding, and guiding, and making sure\nthat everything is in its proper place.\n\n10\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.240\nCuz we could build shapes all day long and\n\n11\n00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.400\nput all sorts of wonderful paths and\ncolors on it.\n\n12\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.750\nBut making sure our art project or\n\n13\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.100\nwhatever document that we're\nworking on is aligned to the T.\n\n14\n00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.780\nOr to the point I should say,\nis very important, so\n\n15\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.350\nthis is why I wanted to make this\nepisode that covers everything.\n\n16\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.820\nGrids, guides, snaps, aligning,\neven throw in some layers in there,\n\n17\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.760\nbecause I feel like they all go together.\n\n18\n00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.910\nI think we've covered or touched a few\nof these things on other episodes.\n\n19\n00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.190\nBut I wanted to get it in one central\nlocation to go over all of these points.\n\n20\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.320\n>> Perfect I like it.\n\n21\n00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.170\n>> Yeah, all right so\nlet's just jump right in.\n\n22\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.920\nAnd I've got Illustrator open.\n\n23\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.410\nWe have gone over the new\nfile dialog box before and\n\n24\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.560\nthe different profiles and\nit does start with our unit.\n\n25\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.476\nSo let's just say that I wasn't\nreally paying attention.\n\n26\n00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:37.330\nAnd I went to go make a document and\nI said okay,\n\n27\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.470\nhere we go let’s just go for it.\n\n28\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.470\nAnd then I realize when I start\nmaking something, I see my square or\n\n29\n00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.390\nanything like that.\n\n30\n00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.090\nWhen I'm go into my x and y or\nmy width and height in my transform panel.\n\n31\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.420\nIt's not in the measurement that I want it\nto be in I'm not wanting to be in points.\n\n32\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.700\n>> Delete it, start all over.\n\n33\n00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.780\n>> Well you could, at this point yeah,\nit might be a good option.\n\n34\n00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.580\nAnd I did show you in the File >\nNew Document, the document settings, wait,\n\n35\n00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.750\nlet me get out of here first.\n\n36\n00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.000\nThere we go, and if I go into\nthe Document Setup, you could go ahead and\n\n37\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.590\nchange the units right there,\nso that's fine.\n\n38\n00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.732\nBut you can do it one more way,\nof course there's always 15\n\n39\n00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:19.255\nways to do things in Illustrator,\nand that's through the rulers.\n\n40\n00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:24.592\nAnd let's bring up the rulers first, and\ntalk about what we can do with them.\n\n41\n00:02:24.592 --> 00:02:28.885\nCuz it's not just changing the units,\nit's actually using the rulers to make\n\n42\n00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:32.370\nguides into measure things,\nif you wanna say.\n\n43\n00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.210\nSo if we're looking for\nsomething to see, it's in the view menu.\n\n44\n00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.200\nSo you can go to View Rulers, but\n\n45\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.670\nthe keyboard trick is Control+R or\nCommand+R for Show Ruler.\n\n46\n00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.160\nSo I wanted to show you that before\nI actually did it on the keyboard.\n\n47\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.500\nSo I have my rulers and it's in the pi,\nno, it's not in the pica, we're in points.\n\n48\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.620\nThe measurement system so\nif you right-click on your rulers\n\n49\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.627\nyou can actually change\nthe measurement system from here.\n\n50\n00:02:57.627 --> 00:02:58.471\n>> Convinient.\n\n51\n00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:02.050\n>> Yeah right, so I can go up to here and\nreally want to be in inches or\n\n52\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.680\nin pixels and I go there and\nyou can see that changes on both.\n\n53\n00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.630\nFor Illustrator it does do both your x and\ny rule at the same time.\n\n54\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.200\nIn some other products,\nit actually does them independently.\n\n55\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.950\nSo if you're in other Adobe products,\n\n56\n00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.770\njust watch to make sure that\nit catches both of them.\n\n57\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.080\nIn Design actually has it separately also.\n\n58\n00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.790\nSo I've got my rulers in\nthe measurement system that I want.\n\n59\n00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.550\nAnd so you can see that when I'm\nmoving it around, it's hard to see.\n\n60\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.690\nBecause it's, you see that little dotted\nline that's moving across on my ruler?\n\n61\n00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:44.810\nThat's indicating to me about where it's\nhitting on the document, on the ruling.\n\n62\n00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.420\nIt's kind of hard to see on that one,\nbut just look for\n\n63\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.120\nthe little dotted line when you're moving\naround, so you know where you're at.\n\n64\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.342\nWhoops, I just hit the wrong\nkeyboard shortcut.\n\n65\n00:03:54.342 --> 00:03:57.550\n[LAUGH] I hit Ctrl+O or\nCmd+O instead of Cmd+0.\n\n66\n00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.070\nAnd I do that a lot,\n\n67\n00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.045\nactually, cuz they're very close together,\nright on top of each other.\n\n68\n00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:04.250\n[LAUGH] So that's what I did there.\n\n69\n00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.930\nBut, the other thing that I use\nthe rulers for is to make guides.\n\n70\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.552\nGuides, what would a guide be?\n\n71\n00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:16.630\nI wanna make sure that I have\nthings within a specific area or\n\n72\n00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.400\nsomething that I wanted to align to.\n\n73\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.590\nFor example,\nin Illustrator you don’t have margins.\n\n74\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.250\nSo If I’m doing a page layout that\nrequires half inch margins all around\n\n75\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.310\nI don't just go into the margin command,\nit doesn't exist.\n\n76\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.980\n>> Okay.\n>> So you have to make them for you,\n\n77\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.030\nyou have to make those margins or guides.\n\n78\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.510\nOr I wanna do a half page ad where I wanna\nmake sure I know exactly where that half\n\n79\n00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.800\npage split is gonna go,\nall those types of things.\n\n80\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.590\nSo to make ruler guides,\nyou drag a guide out from the ruler.\n\n81\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.970\nSo if I start from my x ruler and\nI click, hold and\n\n82\n00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.360\ndrag down you can see that this\nline comes down on my y axis.\n\n83\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.980\nSo I wanna make, and\nI'm gonna guesstimate here,\n\n84\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.040\nmaybe that's about a half inch on here,\nand then I let go.\n\n85\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.100\nAnd you can see that your guides\nalways show up in this bright cyan or\n\n86\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.670\nbright blue.\n\n87\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.210\nWhatever color we want to talk about what\nthat is and that becomes my ruler guide.\n\n88\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.420\nAnd let me just drag one out and\nI don't know if I'm being exactly\n\n89\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.180\naccurate right now but\nI'll get to that in just a second.\n\n90\n00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.510\nSo now I'll grab another guide out here so\nI've made this guide.\n\n91\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.190\nSo if I take a square and\n\n92\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.930\nmove it close you can almost feel it\nkind of snap right to that guide.\n\n93\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.050\nAnd I can put it up here, boop,\nand then it goes right there.\n\n94\n00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.960\nSo it's just another way of\nsaying I know that this is\n\n95\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.160\nhitting those guides right on those x and\ny axis.\n\n96\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.170\nI know that this is where\nit's supposed to be.\n\n97\n00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.225\nNow of course that's if I\nknow where the guides are.\n\n98\n00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:52.700\n[LAUGH] On the ruler, because I don't know\nif that's exactly half inch it doesn't\n\n99\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.280\nreally look like it right now.\n\n100\n00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.180\nSo how can I make sure that this guide\nis in the place that I want to be?\n\n101\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.834\nSo just like if I had a square or any\nitem on my art board I would select it.\n\n102\n00:06:04.834 --> 00:06:10.600\nSo I go to take this guide and I click and\nI click and it won't, I can't select it.\n\n103\n00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.800\nThat's because guides are locked by\ndefault, which is a good thing because\n\n104\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.970\na lot of times you don't want\nto accidentally move your guide.\n\n105\n00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.260\nBecause it's supposed to be a fixed point\nof stay on there, yeah, don't move.\n\n106\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.355\nSo they're locked which is great, how do I\nnot lock them, I guess we can say unlock?\n\n107\n00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:32.510\n[LAUGH] Okay, so if I wanna unlock\nthis guide the easiest way that\n\n108\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.070\nI do it if I have nothing else\nselected on my art board.\n\n109\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.950\nIf you right click in a blank area you\ncan see that you've got your options for\n\n110\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.130\nyour guides right here.\n\n111\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.790\nSo it says lock guides is checked,\nand so I can click on that and\n\n112\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.420\nI can unlock my guides.\n\n113\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.820\nAnd now when I select this guide\nI can actually drag it, and\n\n114\n00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.480\nI can move it around and\nI can do what I want with it.\n\n115\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.740\nAnd while I have it selected,\njust like if I had any other shape or\n\n116\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.000\nanything else selected.\n\n117\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.520\nI can type in the coordinates\nthat I want this guide to be at.\n\n118\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.240\nNow because of the resolution on my\nmonitor, you can't see my transform,\n\n119\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.160\nit will usually be up\nin that control panel.\n\n120\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.020\nSo I'm just gonna go to Window,\nand go to the Transform Panel.\n\n121\n00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.606\nBecause the Transform Panel is where you\ncan pick up all of those different things\n\n122\n00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.280\nthat you have.\n\n123\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.130\nThe x, y, h, and w and\nsome other things like that.\n\n124\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.030\nSo here, I've got my guide selected,\n\n125\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.244\nI know I want that to be on\nmy x axis exactly 0.5 in.\n\n126\n00:07:34.244 --> 00:07:38.550\nSo now I know that this selected margin.\n\n127\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.130\nWell I'm calling it a margin because I\nsaid it when we were doing an example that\n\n128\n00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.825\nit would be a margin.\n\n129\n00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:46.700\n[LAUGH] but this guide is exactly\nat that x coordinate of 0.5, so\n\n130\n00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.080\nI know that that's good.\n\n131\n00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.511\nSo I can then take this guide here,\nyeah, there we go, now it's selected.\n\n132\n00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:57.968\nAnd now I can say that this right here,\nsee, it's at 0.5202.\n\n133\n00:07:57.968 --> 00:07:59.628\nYeah, we're just a little off.\n\n134\n00:07:59.628 --> 00:08:01.010\nSo then I can go again and\nmanually type it in.\n\n135\n00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.579\n>> It was pretty close.\n\n136\n00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:02.902\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, pretty close, yeah,\n\n137\n00:08:02.902 --> 00:08:03.646\nI was good on that one.\n\n138\n00:08:03.646 --> 00:08:06.000\n>> But when you send these off to\nprinters and things like that,\n\n139\n00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.347\nclose is usually not good enough.\n\n140\n00:08:07.347 --> 00:08:10.590\n>> Yeah, you wanna make sure that\nyou're accurate on anything.\n\n141\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.850\nWhether it's print or Web.\n\n142\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.840\nI'm very OCD about making sure that it is.\n\n143\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.020\nAre we aligned in the right place?\n\n144\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.753\nAre we all in the right segment?\n\n145\n00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:22.422\nSo once you've unlocked your guides,\nset them in the place that you wanna be,\n\n146\n00:08:22.422 --> 00:08:24.064\nyou wanna lock them again.\n\n147\n00:08:24.064 --> 00:08:25.650\nYou can Right-click again, but\n\n148\n00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.000\nI should probably show you where\nthe other options are in the menu.\n\n149\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.170\nIt's in the View menu still.\n\n150\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.344\nSo if you go into View and you go to\nGuides, you have the Hide Guides,\n\n151\n00:08:33.344 --> 00:08:34.033\nLock Guides.\n\n152\n00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:38.000\nWe haven't got into the hides yet\nbut the Lock Guides is not checked.\n\n153\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.845\nSo if I click it, just to go back to\nthat View menu again so you can see it.\n\n154\n00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:46.500\nYou can see you've got Lock Guides, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.528\nThat's, lovely.\n\n156\n00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:52.350\nAnd with that hide guides, cuz sometimes\nyou might not want to see these.\n\n157\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.270\nBecause especially if you're\nwanting to clear everything off so\n\n158\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.310\nyou can see it in Preview mode almost.\n\n159\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.870\nYou can hide the guides, so\nif you go to View and you go to Guides and\n\n160\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.680\nyou go to Hide Guides,\nnotice that there is a shortcut for that.\n\n161\n00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.360\nThere is a Cmd-; or Ctrl-; to hide them.\n\n162\n00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.280\nI actually use that quite often.\n\n163\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.770\nSo if I hide them,\nyou can kind of see them without it and\n\n164\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.030\nthen of course you can bring it back.\n\n165\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.010\nI'm Right-clicking on this one.\n\n166\n00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.900\nWhoops, there we go.\n\n167\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.805\nI actually just hid the rulers.\n\n168\n00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:27.789\n[LAUGH] Let me show the ruler again and\nthen I want to show the guides,\n\n169\n00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:29.960\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n170\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.082\n>> Hiding them didn't change them in any\nway, it's just that they're not visible,\n\n171\n00:09:32.082 --> 00:09:33.709\nyou bring them back,\nthey're still right where you set them.\n\n172\n00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:34.232\n>> Yep.\n\n173\n00:09:34.232 --> 00:09:35.091\n>> Perfect.\n\n174\n00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:40.232\n>> And I would like to point out\nhere that any time you make a guide,\n\n175\n00:09:40.232 --> 00:09:44.460\nit is an item in your\nIllustrator document.\n\n176\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.670\nJust like the square or\nif I drew a circle or\n\n177\n00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.120\nanything like that,\nthat's an item as well.\n\n178\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.130\nAnd any items, they do go in a layer,\nokay, and we're gonna get to,\n\n179\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.380\nat the end of this episode we're gonna go\nover layers a little bit more in depth.\n\n180\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.700\nBut I just wanted to\npoint that out right now.\n\n181\n00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.950\nIs that right here, you can see that I've\ngot a guide here and a guide here and\n\n182\n00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.080\na rectangle there within my Layers panel,\nokay?\n\n183\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.450\nSo every guide is an item in a layer.\n\n184\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.000\n>> Very Good.\n\n185\n00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.300\n>> So just as a kind of note,\n\n186\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.860\na lot of times I'll put all\nmy guides in its own layer.\n\n187\n00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.230\nAnd then keep that layer all by itself.\n\n188\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.810\nAnd then put all my other\nitems in other layers\n\n189\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.280\nto keep it a little bit more organized.\n\n190\n00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.170\nAnd that's kind of part of this\nepisode is how to best organize\n\n191\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.810\nall of the things within your document,\nnot just aligning them.\n\n192\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.980\n>> That kinda makes sense so\nyou can easily hide them all at once, but\n\n193\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.360\nwhat you showed is pretty easy way to do.\n\n194\n00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.720\nBut you can also just hide the layer?\n\n195\n00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.390\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or at the end of your project,\n\n196\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.830\nif you wanna get rid of them all,\njust delete the layer?\n\n197\n00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.360\n>> Yeah.\n>> Rather than have to delete each guide?\n\n198\n00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.240\n>> Yeah, exactly yeah,\n\n199\n00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.120\nso it's just kind of knowing\nwhere everything is in its place.\n\n200\n00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.190\nIf we're placing items on our\ndocument in exact coordinates.\n\n201\n00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.440\nHaving everything organized\nwithin the layers and for\n\n202\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.560\nyou to be able to access them is\njust kind of part of best practices.\n\n203\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.810\nI mean, everybody has their own way\nof organizing things, and my way of\n\n204\n00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.670\norganizing might not be the way you\norganize, but it's just how it kinda goes.\n\n205\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.660\nI just wanted to point\nthat out from right here.\n\n206\n00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.050\nSo ruler guides,\ngreat way to keep aligned.\n\n207\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.350\nSome other ways that you can\nknow that you're aligning\n\n208\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.200\nspecifically to wherever you\nwant it to be are the grids.\n\n209\n00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.570\nOkay, so you have guides and\nyou have grids.\n\n210\n00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.920\nGrids, well, it's in the View menu still.\n\n211\n00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.700\nOkay, so you can see that you have\nShow Grid and Snap to Grid, and\n\n212\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.040\nSnap to Point, which is always on.\n\n213\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.120\nSnap to Point is, just so\nI can cover it really quickly.\n\n214\n00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.720\nIt's what you've,\nit's almost like when you feel that\n\n215\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.150\nwhen it's snapping to a ruler or\nsnapping to something else.\n\n216\n00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:47.810\nOr the smart guys where it's kinda\nlike you can feel it kinda snap.\n\n217\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.150\nThat's what it's doing with\nthe Snap to Point, okay,\n\n218\n00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.870\nyou always, I always wanna keep\nthat on honestly, so that's there.\n\n219\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.640\nSo back to the grid, kind of went off\non a little tangent, I tend to do that,\n\n220\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.350\nso if you show the grid\nit's just this grid.\n\n221\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.030\nIt's like graph paper, right?\n\n222\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:11.490\nIt's just a gridded piece of paper now\nthat I have all of these little squares\n\n223\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:16.650\nthat I can use to say,\nall right now am I right there?\n\n224\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.560\nAnd so\nas you can see they're in an increment.\n\n225\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.740\nI think it's eight subdivisions per inch.\n\n226\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.230\nNow how do I know that?\n\n227\n00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.530\nBecause I'm pretty sure I'm\nremembering it properly.\n\n228\n00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:29.960\nBut just like anything,\n\n229\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.660\nif you wanna change it, you can\nalways change it in the Preferences.\n\n230\n00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.050\nLet me throw that in there right now too.\n\n231\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.330\nSo if I go to Preferences,\n\n232\n00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.080\nyou can see there's a whole section for\nGrids and Guides.\n\n233\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.410\nRemember that color of the guide?\n\n234\n00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.140\nIt's right here,\nI could change it if I want to.\n\n235\n00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.740\nAnd there, yep it is,\nevery inch there is eight subdivisions.\n\n236\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.270\nSo if you wanted to change that.\n\n237\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.759\nIf you wanted to do four 16s.\n\n238\n00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:52.183\nYou can have 16ths of an inch and\nthings like that, that's fine too.\n\n239\n00:12:52.183 --> 00:12:55.435\nBut I'm just gonna keep it on\nthe default for now cuz it's good to go.\n\n240\n00:12:55.435 --> 00:13:03.780\nNow I can't see through this white\nsquare because it has a white fill.\n\n241\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.569\nOkay, so I'm gonna turn that fill off,\nlike a none fill, so\n\n242\n00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:08.970\nyou can hopefully see\nit a little bit better.\n\n243\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.480\nSo I can kinda make sure that\nif I know that I want this to be\n\n244\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.790\ntwo inches by two inches,\nI can use this grid to align everything.\n\n245\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.463\nBut just showing the grid does\nnot give you the Snap to Grid.\n\n246\n00:13:21.463 --> 00:13:24.680\nSo they're two separate entities really.\n\n247\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.260\nThey work independently from each other.\n\n248\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.259\nSo, if I go back to the Snap to Grid.\n\n249\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.910\nNow that it's showing you see it's kinda\nboop, boop, it's gonna hit on every one of\n\n250\n00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:42.040\nthose grid lines and actually snap to\nthat increment that I want it to be.\n\n251\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.700\nSo it's kind of another thing.\n\n252\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.512\nBut they do run independently\nfrom each other, so\n\n253\n00:13:47.512 --> 00:13:52.617\nif I wanted to hide the grid,\nlet's go ahead and say Hide the grid.\n\n254\n00:13:52.617 --> 00:13:54.190\nAll right, so,\nyou think it's not there, right?\n\n255\n00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.260\nIf I start moving this square,\nyou can kind of see it's like [SOUND].\n\n256\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.954\nIt's still snapping to the grid,\nbut I turned it off.\n\n257\n00:14:01.954 --> 00:14:06.074\nBut again, independently.\n\n258\n00:14:06.074 --> 00:14:10.117\nSo, one or the other, or\nboth, they do that okay.\n\n259\n00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:14.085\nAnd the keyboard shortcuts there, I do use\nthis a lot because there's a lot of times\n\n260\n00:14:14.085 --> 00:14:16.710\nwhere I want to be really accurate and\nI have this grid.\n\n261\n00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:17.730\nIt's okay, there, there, there.\n\n262\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.680\nI know that everything is like five\nlittle tick marks apart from each other,\n\n263\n00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.950\nsomething like that.\n\n264\n00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.390\nBut then I wanna take off the snap.\n\n265\n00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.610\nSo I've memorized these shortcuts and\nuse them all the time.\n\n266\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.910\nSo you can see it's a Cmd,\nwhat is that thing?\n\n267\n00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.482\nApostrophe?\n\n268\n00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:35.558\nYeah, [LAUGH] I'm like,\nwhat is that little thingy?\n\n269\n00:14:35.558 --> 00:14:39.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then Shift-Cmd- ', or\n\n270\n00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.396\nCtrl if you're using a PC for Cmd, so.\n\n271\n00:14:43.396 --> 00:14:44.637\n>> Very cool.\n>> Yes, great stuff.\n\n272\n00:14:44.637 --> 00:14:49.622\n[LAUGH] This is a little side note that\nI know we haven't gotten into the Pen\n\n273\n00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:53.624\ntool just yet, or\nat least in the filming of this episode,\n\n274\n00:14:53.624 --> 00:14:56.421\n[LAUGH] I haven't gotten to the Pen tool.\n\n275\n00:14:56.421 --> 00:14:57.640\nYou might already have seen the Pen tool.\n\n276\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:02.436\nBut the Pen tool,\nwhen you have your anchor points,\n\n277\n00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:06.750\nand you have your Bezier\nhandles like this.\n\n278\n00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:11.873\nWhen you had that Snap to Grid on\nback before, so I have Snap on.\n\n279\n00:15:11.873 --> 00:15:13.590\nAnd I'll show the grid so you can see.\n\n280\n00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.972\nThese handles used to snap to\nthe grids as well and it was awesome.\n\n281\n00:15:18.972 --> 00:15:19.702\nRemember?\n\n282\n00:15:19.702 --> 00:15:20.467\n>> I mean its fantastic right?\n\n283\n00:15:20.467 --> 00:15:22.801\nThey've taken it away.\n\n284\n00:15:22.801 --> 00:15:25.066\n>> I was going to say,\nthat would be horrible.\n\n285\n00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:26.923\n[LAUGH] If they snap to the grid.\n\n286\n00:15:26.923 --> 00:15:27.561\n>> Yeah.\n\n287\n00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:28.304\n>> So you like it.\n\n288\n00:15:28.304 --> 00:15:28.855\n>> No, no it's great.\n\n289\n00:15:28.855 --> 00:15:31.105\nI thought you meant it's\nhorrible they took it away.\n\n290\n00:15:31.105 --> 00:15:34.107\nYeah, it's really horrible to\nme because I relied on that.\n\n291\n00:15:34.107 --> 00:15:37.595\nBecause if you think about I need\nto know the curvature of this path.\n\n292\n00:15:37.595 --> 00:15:40.950\nAnd I wanna make sure that this\nhandle is four ticks up and\n\n293\n00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.120\nthis handle is four ticks up.\n\n294\n00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.931\nSo I can know that I have\nan accurate curve of the exact same\n\n295\n00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:49.046\nBezier handley things.\n\n296\n00:15:49.046 --> 00:15:50.485\nAnd now it's all gone, what?\n\n297\n00:15:50.485 --> 00:15:52.703\nAnd there was this huge debate.\n\n298\n00:15:52.703 --> 00:15:55.494\nJust look it up on the internet and\nlook on the forums and\n\n299\n00:15:55.494 --> 00:15:58.786\nits just bring this back now, and\nthey freak out about it and so.\n\n300\n00:15:58.786 --> 00:16:00.829\nWhen I-\n>> I'd have thought that would be one\n\n301\n00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:04.515\nthing you wouldn't want to snap to\nthe grid cuz you get a nice control over\n\n302\n00:16:04.515 --> 00:16:08.764\nexactly how that curve looks and you don't\nwant it to pop too far or too little, so.\n\n303\n00:16:08.764 --> 00:16:11.667\n>> I'm sure that's the argument\nthat Adobe is going with, too.\n\n304\n00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:12.502\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n305\n00:16:12.502 --> 00:16:13.780\n>> And I don't know why they took it off.\n\n306\n00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.245\nBut there's forum boards all over,\nit gets nasty.\n\n307\n00:16:17.245 --> 00:16:19.790\n>> And there's no way to turn it back on,\nit's actually removed?\n\n308\n00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.660\n>> It's gone,\n>> Okay.\n\n309\n00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.292\nYeah, I mean,\nI've researched this for a while, and\n\n310\n00:16:25.292 --> 00:16:29.510\nI'm like, what, why isn't this working?\n\n311\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.610\nSo yeah, that's.\n\n312\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.220\n>> Bummer.\n\n313\n00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.221\n>> Yeah, I don't like it, but who knows?\n\n314\n00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:37.100\n[LAUGH]\n>> There was enough people that complained\n\n315\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.800\nabout it to Adobe that they took it away,\nso.\n\n316\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.242\nMaybe that's the next version,\nthey'll bring it back or something.\n\n317\n00:16:41.242 --> 00:16:41.980\nMaybe [LAUGH].\n\n318\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.020\n>> We can hope.\n\n319\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.710\nJust wanted to throw that in,\nsince I was already on the grid part and\n\n320\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.820\nthe snapping, and one part that I was\nvery upset that they took it away.\n\n321\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.620\n>> Well, after they watch these videos,\nmaybe they'll bring it back.\n\n322\n00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.600\n>> Yeah, there we go, I think we can\nstart a new revolution on some forum.\n\n323\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.730\n>> We'll put a petition somewhere,\n\n324\n00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.150\neverybody out there that's\nwatching can sign it [LAUGH].\n\n325\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.640\n>> Exactly, that sounds good,\nso all right, so\n\n326\n00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.220\nthat's the snap to grids,\nand wonderful things.\n\n327\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:14.994\nSo, let's go over the Transform\npanel just a little bit more.\n\n328\n00:17:14.994 --> 00:17:18.135\nLet me turn some of these things off,\nso you can me actually do it,\n\n329\n00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:19.234\nlet me hide the grids.\n\n330\n00:17:19.234 --> 00:17:23.941\nAnd let me turn off the snap to grids\nbecause It's just what I want to do right\n\n331\n00:17:23.941 --> 00:17:26.580\nnow and I will delete all of these things.\n\n332\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.860\nSo with the Transform panel you\ncan accurately put in the x and\n\n333\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.836\ny coordinates,\nwhich we have probably gone over before.\n\n334\n00:17:35.836 --> 00:17:43.590\nBut one thing that you need to be somewhat\naware of is this little guy right here.\n\n335\n00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:48.050\nAnd this is the point of reference as\nto when you're typing in your x and\n\n336\n00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:53.190\ny coordinates of where you want something\nto be, you have to watch what dot\n\n337\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.890\nis on in this box because that's where\nit's going to reference whatever x and\n\n338\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.190\ny coordinate you're going to be typing in.\n\n339\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:06.250\nSo if I know that I wanted the top left\nof this square to be a half inch in,\n\n340\n00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:11.280\nhalf inch down, then make sure\nthat the left point is on there.\n\n341\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.540\nI think it's in default by in the middle.\n\n342\n00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.130\nSo if you type that in, then the middle;s\ngonna go to wherever your and x and\n\n343\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.610\ny is gonna be.\n\n344\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.560\nOkay, and then, of course,\nyou can type in your width and\n\n345\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.350\nyour height, and you can do that and\nthat's wonderful.\n\n346\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.340\n22, I'm sorry, it was hiding.\n\n347\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.843\nSo while we're still in\nthis Transform panel,\n\n348\n00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:35.464\nthere is one other thing I\nwanted to point out that really\n\n349\n00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:40.086\nkinda got me when I started\nworking in Illustrator, and\n\n350\n00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:46.504\nthat was making the Stroke Scale when\nyou change the size of an object, okay.\n\n351\n00:18:46.504 --> 00:18:49.468\nI just wanted to show you in the Transform\npanel here that it's right there,\n\n352\n00:18:49.468 --> 00:18:50.501\nScale Stroke & Effects.\n\n353\n00:18:50.501 --> 00:18:54.930\nThis is also in the Preferences menu.\n\n354\n00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.480\nSo let me just go there really quickly.\n\n355\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.840\nIt's in the general,\nI keep always clicking there.\n\n356\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.490\nSo General, it's right there.\n\n357\n00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:06.040\nOkay, Scale Stroke & Effect, so\nit's an option right there that\n\n358\n00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.390\nonce I found this it's like, gosh, now I\nknow why it's actually not doing that, so.\n\n359\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.110\n>> So before if you had an object and\nyou had a, say,\n\n360\n00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.410\na stroke on there that was\nproportionate to the object and\n\n361\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.680\nyou scaled the object, the stroke would\nnot scale with it, is what you're saying.\n\n362\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.210\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay.\n\n363\n00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.410\n>> And that would kind of throw me off,\nI'm like, but I made the square smaller.\n\n364\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:28.340\nLet me just demonstrate really quickly so\nyou can see with it off.\n\n365\n00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.400\nCuz I don't have it on right now, do I?\n\n366\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.390\nLet me double-check.\n\n367\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.910\nOkay, I don't have it on [LAUGH].\n\n368\n00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.690\nSo I have over here, let's say,\nI have like a 20 point stroke.\n\n369\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.954\nAnd on this size square, maybe that's\nwhat I want it to be and it's fine.\n\n370\n00:19:42.954 --> 00:19:49.640\nWell, I take this and then I size it down\nand it just doesn't look the right way.\n\n371\n00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.800\nOr if I make it really,\n\n372\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.810\nreally big, see it's not the,\nit's just not the same anymore.\n\n373\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.540\nSo if I go like really small, there,\n\n374\n00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.070\nthat's where you can\nreally kind of see it.\n\n375\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.720\nBecause if I had made that smaller,\nit should scale with it, okay?\n\n376\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.360\nSo that's where if you take, well, I don't\nknow why I just deleted that [LAUGH].\n\n377\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.060\nLet me take this off and\nlet's go with the 20 point scale, and\n\n378\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.440\nI turn that scale Stroke & Effects on,\nthere we go.\n\n379\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.948\nAnd now I make this here,\nwhy did it turn off?\n\n380\n00:20:17.948 --> 00:20:19.560\nThere we go, so I make that smaller.\n\n381\n00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.830\nYou see how, now, the stroke-\n>> Much better.\n\n382\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.810\n>> Is proportionate.\n\n383\n00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:28.770\nNow, it gives me this weird, what is it,\n4.615 point stroke on there.\n\n384\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.825\nSo, it will give you some\nodd measurements, but\n\n385\n00:20:31.825 --> 00:20:35.195\nit does scale proportionately\nto however I drew it.\n\n386\n00:20:35.195 --> 00:20:36.605\nAnd whatever that stroke is,\n\n387\n00:20:36.605 --> 00:20:39.455\nit's going to be that way when I\nmake it smaller or make it bigger.\n\n388\n00:20:39.455 --> 00:20:39.955\n>> Very nice.\n\n389\n00:20:39.955 --> 00:20:41.405\n>> It can be a good thing,\nit can be a bad thing.\n\n390\n00:20:41.405 --> 00:20:44.215\nIt just really depends on which\nway you wanna go with it.\n\n391\n00:20:44.215 --> 00:20:47.545\nSo, just turning it on or off, or\nat least knowing what it is and\n\n392\n00:20:47.545 --> 00:20:51.355\nwhere to find it, was a big deal for\nme when I first started.\n\n393\n00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:52.570\n>> I can see.\n\n394\n00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.370\n>> So there we go.\n\n395\n00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.100\nSo that's the Scale Stroke & Effects.\n\n396\n00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.460\nSo I wanted to go over aligning\nobjects because that's another thing.\n\n397\n00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:07.010\nIf I have multiple items on a file,\nI want to work with it.\n\n398\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.250\nSo I actually have a file\nthat's already created\n\n399\n00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.420\nin my files, so let's go over here.\n\n400\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.370\nSo you can see that I've got some\nreally pretty, colored squares and\n\n401\n00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.230\ncircles in here.\n\n402\n00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:27.400\nAnd I have all of these and\nI want to align them in some way.\n\n403\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.210\nNow, I wanna align them going across and\nI want all of the tops to be the same or\n\n404\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.330\nall the bottoms to be the same.\n\n405\n00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.330\nSo if take all of these selected squares,\nI'm just gonna click hold and\n\n406\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.730\ndrag around them.\n\n407\n00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.506\nYou do have an aligned panel,\nwhich is great, so\n\n408\n00:21:41.506 --> 00:21:46.140\nwe are going to stay here, and it will go\nacross the top with a larger resolution.\n\n409\n00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.778\nThese are for the ones across, you can\nsee the little icons there that align\n\n410\n00:21:49.778 --> 00:21:53.674\nthe vertical tops, align the vertical\nmiddles, align the vertical bottoms.\n\n411\n00:21:53.674 --> 00:21:57.764\nAnd then if you were going this way,\nyou can say go ahead and, say,\n\n412\n00:21:57.764 --> 00:22:02.020\ntake the horizontal edges and\nthen go head and align them from there.\n\n413\n00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.493\nYou also have them distribute,\nhow you can distribute the the spaces, and\n\n414\n00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:11.179\nit's going to distribute based upon where\nin the object that you want it to be,\n\n415\n00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:14.738\nwhich is a little bit different\nthan actually spacing out.\n\n416\n00:22:14.738 --> 00:22:16.037\nHere, I've lost where I'm going.\n\n417\n00:22:16.037 --> 00:22:18.290\nSorry, I forgot,\nI've gotta show the options.\n\n418\n00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.900\nThat's why I was like,\nwhere's my other guy?\n\n419\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.330\nWhich is also different than\ndistribute the spacing.\n\n420\n00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.220\nSo that's different.\n\n421\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.740\nCuz if I have different sized objects,\n\n422\n00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.550\nthen the space between\nthem's gonna be different.\n\n423\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.740\nIf I take each one of the tops and\nspace them according to that\n\n424\n00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.680\nversus take the actual space between them-\n>> And make it equal.\n\n425\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.944\n>> Exactly.\nSo that's something to notice.\n\n426\n00:22:35.944 --> 00:22:39.185\nAnd note, I did have to show the options\non it, so if you're not finding it,\n\n427\n00:22:39.185 --> 00:22:42.120\nmake sure you show the options\nin the Align panel.\n\n428\n00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.241\nSo I've got my, what is this, five?\n\n429\n00:22:44.241 --> 00:22:46.250\nI've got my five rectangles selected, and\n\n430\n00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.720\nI am just gonna go ahead and\nalign it to the top.\n\n431\n00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.650\nAnd I, actually [LAUGH], well,\n\n432\n00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.580\nI put a preference on here that,\nyou were like, well, where did it go?\n\n433\n00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.540\nIt aligned them all at the top\nof the art board, right?\n\n434\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.702\n>> Yeah, it did, where'd my guy go?\n\n435\n00:22:58.702 --> 00:23:00.455\n>> Yeah, that's a different file.\n\n436\n00:23:00.455 --> 00:23:01.320\n>> That's right [LAUGH].\n\n437\n00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:01.880\n>> We switched files.\n\n438\n00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.695\nPay attention Mike, come on [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:23:02.695 --> 00:23:07.870\nThe reason is because in this\none I forgot to turn it back\n\n440\n00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:12.160\nto its default because I was, obviously,\nworking in Illustrator before this.\n\n441\n00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.870\nIt is normally aligned to selection.\n\n442\n00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.680\nRight now, I have it aligned to artboard.\n\n443\n00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.630\nSo, my Illustrator got a little ahead\nof me and how I wanted to explain it,\n\n444\n00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:26.030\nbut now you know that you have different\nthings of where it will align to.\n\n445\n00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.810\nLet's undo that so\nI can go back to show you what it would\n\n446\n00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.580\ndo if you did not have any of\nthese different options on.\n\n447\n00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.390\nBy default it aligns to selection.\n\n448\n00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:41.470\nSo if take the align to tops you can\nsee it aligns the tops of all of these\n\n449\n00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:48.910\nsquare rectangly things to the top of the-\n>> Is it the first selected item or?\n\n450\n00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.480\n>> It's the highest.\n\n451\n00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.090\n>> Okay.\n\n452\n00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:55.048\n>> So just to kind of point this out,\nif I took this guy, right?\n\n453\n00:23:55.048 --> 00:23:55.950\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Notice cuz\n\n454\n00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:59.836\nthe blue one is the one I selected first,\nif you wanna say.\n\n455\n00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:01.649\n>> Right.\n>> If I check that, see,\n\n456\n00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:03.539\nit takes it to the Toppest top.\n\n457\n00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:04.073\n>> Gotcha.\n\n458\n00:24:04.073 --> 00:24:05.176\n>> Which-\n>> The highest high.\n\n459\n00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:05.676\n>> Yeah.\n\n460\n00:24:05.676 --> 00:24:09.340\n[LAUGH] So,\nthere I go making my words again.\n\n461\n00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:14.500\nThat's what it does, which is fine,\nif that's what you want it to be.\n\n462\n00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:19.200\nBut what if I wanted to take all\nthese items and align it to, say,\n\n463\n00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.360\nthe purple line of the square, right?\n\n464\n00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.130\nHow can I do that?\n\n465\n00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:28.260\nThat's something that is select key which\nis a pretty awesome thing that they added,\n\n466\n00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.620\nbecause they didn't have this\nbefore you had to all rearrange.\n\n467\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:37.930\nSo that's in that option that I have\nhere see it's a line to key object.\n\n468\n00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:42.610\nNow if I check that and just say Well\nwhat happened, that's not the purple one,\n\n469\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:48.630\nI didn't actually show you that how\nyou can select the key object, okay.\n\n470\n00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.200\nSo, first let me go with\nthe line to key object.\n\n471\n00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.530\nNow that I have all these selected.\n\n472\n00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.110\nOnes that I single click in\nthose selected items of which\n\n473\n00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.830\none I want to become the key.\n\n474\n00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:05.980\nAnd it makes this kind of like a darker\nblue outline on that versus that.\n\n475\n00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:11.360\nSo that I've indicated that is my key item\nand because it's a line to key object\n\n476\n00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.370\nwhen I go to top you can see that it's\ngoing to align to the top of the purple.\n\n477\n00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.120\n>> That is handy.\n\n478\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.210\n>> It is very handy.\n\n479\n00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:22.070\nYes, it's a lovely little Little item so\nalign to key object versus align to\n\n480\n00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:27.100\nselection and you saw from the first one,\nalign to art board means\n\n481\n00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.860\nthat if I want to take these and align\nthem to the top of the art board it goes.\n\n482\n00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.005\nIf I want to take them all and align\nto the bottom and so on and so forth.\n\n483\n00:25:34.005 --> 00:25:35.240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n484\n00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.596\n>> That is a handy thing [CROSSTALK] if\nyou want something to go to the edge.\n\n485\n00:25:38.596 --> 00:25:43.430\nJust make sure you know which\nalign to option that you have on.\n\n486\n00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.930\nWithin the transform panel\nof how you want it to go.\n\n487\n00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.210\nSo that's just something\nto take into consideration.\n\n488\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:50.840\nAnd you can do the same thing vertically.\n\n489\n00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.840\nI'll just do it really quickly.\n\n490\n00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:58.800\nYou can see like align all the lefts or if\nI wanted to distribute the equal spacing.\n\n491\n00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.870\nThat, oops, why did it do that?\n\n492\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.770\n>> That's gonna be to the art board.\n\n493\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.380\n>> Exactly.\nSo that is again very\n\n494\n00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.370\nhandy if you want these\nthings evenly spaced out with\n\n495\n00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.310\nthe same spacing between them\nall across the art board.\n\n496\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.430\nSo that's pretty awesome if\nthat's what you're wanting to do.\n\n497\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.930\nAnd I have, you can see that I\nobviously do this all the time.\n\n498\n00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:22.740\nIs like I forgot whatever I had left on\nbefore I started doing whatever work.\n\n499\n00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.410\nAnd with this one you can also just for\na fun little guy you can see that I have\n\n500\n00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.450\nthis align center, center, right, and\nit makes, it almost looks like the top of\n\n501\n00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.710\nlike a drink, like with the [INAUDIBLE]\n>> A strange eyeball.\n\n502\n00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.150\n>> Yeah or a strange eyeball.\n\n503\n00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:40.430\nSo I've got them to work cuz they're all\ncircles and they all have centers so\n\n504\n00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.460\nthey align center center.\n\n505\n00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.800\nIs, it was like a little handy guide.\n\n506\n00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.550\nAnd the reason I know that the yellow and\nthe purple and the blue and\n\n507\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:53.230\nthe pink are in this particular order\nis because I set them that way.\n\n508\n00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.840\nOkay?\n\n509\n00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.220\nSo having those stacking orders,\nwhich we've gone over somewhere else, but\n\n510\n00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.620\nI'll just kind of go over again here.\n\n511\n00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.110\nIt is based on the layers panel so\n\n512\n00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:06.510\nit's kind of a nice little segue\ninto working with the layers panel.\n\n513\n00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.010\nOkay, I wanna kind of cover\nthat more in depth here.\n\n514\n00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:16.260\nSo if I have this red rectangle,\nyou see the red is on top of the blue And\n\n515\n00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.770\nit all is in the order that I draw things,\nokay?\n\n516\n00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.350\nSo that's what we've got, and you can\nsee over here in the stacking order\n\n517\n00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.930\nthat from the bottom that's\nwhere we're going to to top and\n\n518\n00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.985\neverything has its Particular layer or\n\n519\n00:27:30.985 --> 00:27:35.375\ndistribution, whatever you want to say,\nstacking order within the document.\n\n520\n00:27:35.375 --> 00:27:39.393\nAnd if I wanted to take\nthis guy right here,\n\n521\n00:27:39.393 --> 00:27:44.235\nthis green guy,\nnow I showed you in some other\n\n522\n00:27:44.235 --> 00:27:49.780\nplaces where you can take your arrange and\nif I send back word,\n\n523\n00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.070\nlet me just show you and watch that\nlayers panel over there above my head.\n\n524\n00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.380\nYou can see that now, the green,\nlet me just undo so you can see that.\n\n525\n00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:01.480\nSee it was here, oops no,\nlet me go forward.\n\n526\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.270\nThere we go, and so\n\n527\n00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:06.490\nnow it's gone below the purple\nbecause I said send backward, okay.\n\n528\n00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.830\nIf I had said send to back,\n\n529\n00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:14.360\nit's gonna go all the way down to\nthe bottom of the stacking order here.\n\n530\n00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.350\nSo that's send to back of\nthat particular layer.\n\n531\n00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:19.060\n>> Hm.\n\n532\n00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.930\n>> Okay.\nWhen we start getting into multiple\n\n533\n00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:26.030\nlayers, then it's only gonna go to\nthe bottom of the whatever it live,\n\n534\n00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:26.810\nit, it lives.\n\n535\n00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.470\nAnd each layer.\n\n536\n00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.220\nHas its own stacking order as well.\n\n537\n00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.030\nSo it's something to always watch for and\n\n538\n00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:39.680\nyou always have layer one when\nyou're designing something.\n\n539\n00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.130\nSo and that's fine I I usually don't\n\n540\n00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:47.030\nstart making layers unless I really\nknow that I need to have one.\n\n541\n00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.790\nSo let's go there now.\n\n542\n00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.640\nAll right, so layer one is layer one.\n\n543\n00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.380\nI know that I'm going to need to have\nanother layer separate from these guys\n\n544\n00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.960\nthat are gonna be for the stars.\n\n545\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.520\nOkay, cuz I wanna make some stars and\nI want them by themselves.\n\n546\n00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.780\nSo I wanna start organizing my thoughts if\nyou wanna say and organizing my design.\n\n547\n00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.840\nSo let me go over here to the star tool.\n\n548\n00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.280\nAnd if I start drawing a star it's like,\nwell where is it going?\n\n549\n00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.020\n>> On the existing layer.\n\n550\n00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.495\n>> Yeah, see,\nbecause I started just going, right?\n\n551\n00:29:14.495 --> 00:29:15.670\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I forgot like, wait,\n\n552\n00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:17.770\nI just told them I was gonna make a layer.\n\n553\n00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.800\nSo Let me back up on that, let me undo.\n\n554\n00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.150\nHow do I make a new layer?\n\n555\n00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:25.420\nThere's a couple ways you can\ngo to the new layer button.\n\n556\n00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.170\nYes sorry.\n\n557\n00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:26.735\nI was hiding it.\n\n558\n00:29:26.735 --> 00:29:28.310\n[LAUGHING] I was covering it up.\n\n559\n00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.960\nYou can go to the new layer button down\nthe button most like a piece of paper.\n\n560\n00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.700\nYou can also go to the layers menu,\n\n561\n00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.890\ngo to layered, a new layer there and\nyou see its just a layer to.\n\n562\n00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.590\nOkay.\nBecause I gone to the options\n\n563\n00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.980\nin the Panel options.\n\n564\n00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.050\nIt did give me the layer options\nof where I could name it.\n\n565\n00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.050\nI'm just gonna keep it layer two for\nnow so I can show you later.\n\n566\n00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:52.020\nSo I've actually created a new layer for\nme to start working in.\n\n567\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.540\nSo now, if I start drawing my stars,\n\n568\n00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:59.650\nyou can see that all of my\nstars live in layer two.\n\n569\n00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.420\nAnd if I wanted to make another new layer,\nso now I've got layer three.\n\n570\n00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.980\nThree, and maybe I wanna make\nsome hexagons, or whatever.\n\n571\n00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.620\nSo now my hexagons live in layer three.\n\n572\n00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.070\nNow why would I wanna do this?\n\n573\n00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.990\nOkay, it's just for\norganization purposes, okay.\n\n574\n00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:16.470\nYou don't ever have to use the layers\nif you don't want to, but I do.\n\n575\n00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.760\nI mean, if I'm gonna do my text objects,\nI like to keep my text on my text\n\n576\n00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.050\nobjects and my shapes on my\nshapes on my shapes objects.\n\n577\n00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.350\nAnd things like that if\nyou wanted to do it.\n\n578\n00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.870\nNow each of these layers,\nyou can see I can collapse down.\n\n579\n00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:35.850\nAnd if I take, let's say,\nall of the items in the stars.\n\n580\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.830\nSo, I just clicked on them,\nI kind of know that they all live there.\n\n581\n00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:43.280\nYou can see that it's above\nthe eyeball-looking guy,\n\n582\n00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.310\nthat's layer one, but it's behind.\n\n583\n00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.420\nIf I change the color\nyou can really see it.\n\n584\n00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.700\nIt's behind the hexagons,\nbecause, that's again,\n\n585\n00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.160\nthe whole layer has a stacking order.\n\n586\n00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.920\nIf I really wanted layer two, everything\nin layer two to be above layer three,\n\n587\n00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.660\nyou just click, hold, and\ndrag all the way up, make the line go.\n\n588\n00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:06.750\nAnd actually, I didn't go high enough, and\nthis is a point to see that I actually\n\n589\n00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.980\ngrouped, if you want to say, or sub\nlayered, layer to inside of layer three.\n\n590\n00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.180\n>> Kind of nested in there.\n\n591\n00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.330\n>> Nested, thank you,\nthat was the right word.\n\n592\n00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.390\nSo be careful about that.\n\n593\n00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.420\nYou've gotta watch that line\nthat goes all the way up.\n\n594\n00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.438\nSometimes it's actually easier to bring\nthings down than it is to bring things up.\n\n595\n00:31:23.438 --> 00:31:23.946\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes.\n\n596\n00:31:23.946 --> 00:31:24.534\n[LAUGH] Especially for\n\n597\n00:31:24.534 --> 00:31:25.590\nthat very top one anyway.\n\n598\n00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.230\n>> Yeah, and for demonstration purposes so\nyou can actually see me doing it.\n\n599\n00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:33.430\nSo that layer two is\ncompletely above layer three.\n\n600\n00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:34.810\nNow layer one, layer two, layer three,\n\n601\n00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:39.730\nis not very easy to start referring to,\nso you can rename them.\n\n602\n00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.570\nOkay, so you can just double click on\nlayer two, and we can name this stars.\n\n603\n00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.480\nWe can double click on layer three and\nwe can name this hexagons.\n\n604\n00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.605\nI'm just gonna go with hex so\nI don't misspell it.\n\n605\n00:31:49.605 --> 00:31:50.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n606\n00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.520\nthen layer one we can go with,\n>> Squares.\n\n607\n00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.500\nNow, you're saying,\naren't there circles on that layer?\n\n608\n00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.580\nI did that on purpose.\n\n609\n00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.859\n[LAUGH] Because a lot of times\nwhen I'm designing I don't know,\n\n610\n00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:08.621\nthat I even want a new layer,\nI'm just drawing, just going, going,\n\n611\n00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:12.494\ngoing, going, going, so,\nI want to put this eyeball,\n\n612\n00:32:12.494 --> 00:32:17.400\nthese circles that I have already\nexisting in this square layer.\n\n613\n00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.910\nI wanna separate them out, I wanna,\nbut I don't wanna have to delete them,\n\n614\n00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.370\nor copy, there's an easier way to do this,\nokay, so\n\n615\n00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.920\nthis is where moving items from a layer\ninto a new layer after the fact.\n\n616\n00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.490\nSo, I know I wanna new layer,\nso let's make a new one, okay?\n\n617\n00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:37.400\nAnd we'll name this circles, off the bat,\nand we'll say, these are my circles.\n\n618\n00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:42.600\nIn the layers,\nanytime you have a layer you can\n\n619\n00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.360\nsee that you have items selected\nby the little dots over here.\n\n620\n00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.100\nThose little dots indicate that you are,\nthat is the selected item that you have,\n\n621\n00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.300\nokay, just like if I click on\nthere there's a little dot, and\n\n622\n00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.480\neverything right that, the other,\nyou can do it in reverse.\n\n623\n00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.210\nIf you wanted to select\nan item from the layers panel,\n\n624\n00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.090\nyou don't just click on the layer.\n\n625\n00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:09.640\nYou have to click on the little circley\nguy, little circle guy next to that layer\n\n626\n00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.770\nitem, and so I'm holding the shift key\nover here, so I can click on the circles\n\n627\n00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:19.320\nof each one of those layer items, and so\nnow I know that I have all the ellipses.\n\n628\n00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:24.570\nThis is really good to be able to isolate,\nand select things in a very complex\n\n629\n00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:29.080\ndesign, so you can have it ready to go,\nso I've got all these dots going on here.\n\n630\n00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.670\nNow, I don't go from the sub layers,\n\n631\n00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:36.950\nif you wanna call it, you see there's that\ntop one, see, that's the squares layer.\n\n632\n00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:41.680\nSo, it's basically saying that all\nof the selected items within this\n\n633\n00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:47.040\nlayer when I take this little dot,\nand I click hold, and drag it.\n\n634\n00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.870\nYou can see how it goes from\nthere to there, then I let go,\n\n635\n00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:56.260\nand all of those things just\nmoved up into the circles layer.\n\n636\n00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.540\n>> Okay.\n>> It's super handy,\n\n637\n00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.210\nI use this all the time.\n\n638\n00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.620\n>> So it's not saying you're\ngonna move that entire layer,\n\n639\n00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.590\nit's saying I'm gonna move all your\nselected objects from this layer.\n\n640\n00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.830\n>> From this, yeah, exactly, and\nI mean you can do it individually,\n\n641\n00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.500\nbecause if I was like,\nlet's say I'm on the hexagon layer.\n\n642\n00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.610\nRight, I know I'm on the hexagon layer,\ncuz you can see it's kinda highlighted,\n\n643\n00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:14.660\nif you wanna say.\n\n644\n00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.820\nThat's where, if you start making layers\nyou gotta be very aware of where am I?\n\n645\n00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.830\nWhat layer am I on, what do I need to\nbe on, so If I'm on the hexagon layer,\n\n646\n00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:27.280\nand I start drawing a circle like this,\nwait nope,\n\n647\n00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.240\nyou're in the wrong layer\nthere little circley guy.\n\n648\n00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.670\nYou need to be down in the circle layer,\nso in this sense, I could draw, since\n\n649\n00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.700\nit's just one item, I could just take that\nlittle dot here, drag it down into there,\n\n650\n00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:44.600\nand now it's in here, and so now I've\ngot my circles hanging out over there.\n\n651\n00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.480\nSame thing with stacking order,\n\n652\n00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.150\nif I take this guy and\narrange it to the back, right?\n\n653\n00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:55.370\nIt's going to the back of the circles\nlayer, it's not going down in the squares,\n\n654\n00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:59.950\nor anything like that,\nit's just staying within it's layer, okay?\n\n655\n00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.790\nAnd I know we're like,\nprobably need to go soon Sam, but\n\n656\n00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:03.602\njust give me two more seconds.\n\n657\n00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:04.142\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, no.\n\n658\n00:35:04.142 --> 00:35:05.892\nNo hurry, it's good stuff.\n\n659\n00:35:05.892 --> 00:35:06.512\n>> It is, right?\n\n660\n00:35:06.512 --> 00:35:07.342\nI just get, so excited and\n\n661\n00:35:07.342 --> 00:35:12.280\nI want to complete the thought, so this\none right here with these two hexagons, if\n\n662\n00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.610\nI take this, I just want to give you some\nmore examples of what happens in layers,\n\n663\n00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.370\nif I group those two,\n\n664\n00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:23.830\nyou can see that, I've got a group\nwithin that hexagon layer.\n\n665\n00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:28.550\nSo, groups will come into\nlayers like that, and I can\n\n666\n00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.360\nsee where they are, and I can go down\ninto each one of them, and I can go, so I\n\n667\n00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.630\njust want to show that if you group stuff\nand you can put layers inside of layers.\n\n668\n00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:42.000\nYou can put groups inside of groups,\nso you just have to kind of watch for\n\n669\n00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.700\nthat organizational structure,\nwhere are you in that layers panel,\n\n670\n00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:50.990\nwhat layer do I have selected, and\nall of that kind of wonderful stuff.\n\n671\n00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:55.450\nYou can also lock layers which is really\ngood, so let's just say like I wanted to\n\n672\n00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:58.180\ntake this, and make like, for example I\nwanna make like a colored background,\n\n673\n00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.150\nright, I wanna make a green maybe green's\nnot good, cuz I've got green on the other\n\n674\n00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.455\ngreen stuff, there we go,\nno let's go with this guy, I'm sorry.\n\n675\n00:36:05.455 --> 00:36:07.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just pick something Bon,\n\n676\n00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.293\nokay there we go.\n\n677\n00:36:08.293 --> 00:36:12.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so I've got this in here,\n\n678\n00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.410\nif I put this down, because I want\nthis to be the colored background,\n\n679\n00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.090\nwell if I start selecting things, and\n\n680\n00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:23.560\nI'm trying to click off, I keep\naccidentally selecting that background.\n\n681\n00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.590\n>> Right.\n>> That's where using layers,\n\n682\n00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:28.820\nyou can say lock this little guy here,\nokay?\n\n683\n00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.890\nSo, I got this layer locked,\n\n684\n00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:36.530\nnow I'm never actually selecting it on\nthe document, so I can move things around,\n\n685\n00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.040\nclick off of it, and that guy's there,\ndoes it have to be in its own layer?\n\n686\n00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:45.050\nNo, you can actually take individual ones,\nlike if I don't want to be\n\n687\n00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:51.020\nable to select that, you can lock it\nwithin sub layers within a layer,\n\n688\n00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.440\nso it doesn't have to be by itself,\nbut, if you lock a layer,\n\n689\n00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:59.870\nnotice that it will lock all of\nthe items within the layer that it's in.\n\n690\n00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:05.540\nSo just kind of be aware of that option,\nand be careful about turning them on,\n\n691\n00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.960\nand off, but, those are different things,\nlike why can't I select it?\n\n692\n00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.190\nLook in the layers panel.\n\n693\n00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.480\nWhere is all of these things?\n\n694\n00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.840\nWhat's missing?\n\n695\n00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.560\nAlways, look at your layers panel, because\nthat will tell you everything that's in\n\n696\n00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.360\nyour document, and you can go through it,\nand really pinpoint exactly,\n\n697\n00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.977\nwhat is where you want it to be, and\nhow to select it to move around,\n\n698\n00:37:24.977 --> 00:37:27.970\nthere we go [LAUGH]\n>> Wow, fantastic,\n\n699\n00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:32.980\nwell a lot of great information there, on\nhow we place objects, or how we organize\n\n700\n00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:37.440\nthe objects within our document aligning\nthem to the grid turning on our rulers,\n\n701\n00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.450\ncreating those guides, as well,\nas organizing the document itself, right?\n\n702\n00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.320\nWith the different layers,\ngrouping, locking them, so\n\n703\n00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.220\nwe don't accidentally move them,\nlots of great information.\n\n704\n00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.706\nThank you for that, hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching, signing off for\n\n705\n00:37:50.706 --> 00:37:51.895\nnow, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n706\n00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:52.696\n>> I'm Bon Smith.\n\n707\n00:37:52.696 --> 00:37:54.019\n>> And we'll see you next

--> 00:00:19.370\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC2015.\n\n4\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.400\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.360\nwe're gonna be doing some\nadvanced shapes and paths.\n\n6\n00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.410\nNow, we've already taken\na look at some basic work,\n\n7\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.660\nwe're gonna be doing some\nbasic work with shapes.\n\n8\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.620\nAnd now we're just going\nto kick it up a notch.\n\n9\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.530\nAnd here to help us with that is Ms.\nVaughn Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.570\nHow's it going Vaughn?\n\n11\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.010\n>> Good, back for more shaping.\n\n12\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.640\nWe did some basic shapes.\n\n13\n00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.050\nWe can draw circles and\nsquares all day long.\n\n14\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.540\nBut how we can use those simple shapes\nto create more advanced shapes, or\n\n15\n00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.482\nhow do I modify my existing shapes to do\nmore than just be a circle or be a square.\n\n16\n00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:55.674\nWhat if I wanna make a Christmas tree,\nor some moons, or some mountains,\n\n17\n00:00:55.674 --> 00:00:56.453\nor what have you?\n\n18\n00:00:56.453 --> 00:00:59.360\n>> So shapes can grow up\nto be whatever they want.\n\n19\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.927\n>> Yeah, they start baby and\nthey get bigger.\n\n20\n00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:04.037\n>> All right.\nSo we're gonna do things with that, and\n\n21\n00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:08.637\nhow it can combine all of our paths\nbecause shapes really are paths.\n\n22\n00:01:08.637 --> 00:01:13.512\nSo that's probably something we should\nstart off right from the beginning is\n\n23\n00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:17.787\njust reiterating and clarifying\nan open path versus a closed path.\n\n24\n00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:19.515\nAgain, back to that basics.\n\n25\n00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:23.285\nSo, let's just jump in\nhere with our circles.\n\n26\n00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:27.983\nI have file that I've already created\nwith a bunch of shapes called pathfinder.\n\n27\n00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:33.725\nSo this is a closed path that\nwe had talked about before.\n\n28\n00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:35.725\nIt has an inside and it has an outside.\n\n29\n00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:39.180\nIt has a fill and a stroke,\nokay, and it's closed.\n\n30\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.050\nThen I have an open path,\noops wrong one, there.\n\n31\n00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.840\nThis is an open path,\nthere is no fill here.\n\n32\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.600\nAll I have is a stroke because this\nwas created with a line segment tool.\n\n33\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.860\nSo just the stroke, not the fill.\n\n34\n00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.800\nOkay, so open and closed.\n\n35\n00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.920\nAnother thing you'll hear me say,\nand this is just me talking,\n\n36\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.450\nthe whole path versus pieces of a path.\n\n37\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.530\nFor example, if I go here and this, to me,\n\n38\n00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.372\nlooks like, well,\nlooks like a thing [LAUGH].\n\n39\n00:02:10.372 --> 00:02:14.442\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It just looks like lines together, but\n\n40\n00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:17.850\nthis is two separate segments, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.360\nSo there's this guy and then there's\nthis guy, they're not the same.\n\n42\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.410\nThey're not the whole path, as I say it.\n\n43\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.664\nSo you'll probably hear me referring\nto that throughout this episode.\n\n44\n00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:34.432\nAnd that's what I mean,\nthe whole versus parts of it.\n\n45\n00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:35.222\n>> Okay.\n\n46\n00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:36.499\nOkay.\n\n47\n00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:37.970\nAll right, so if I got this circle.\n\n48\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.735\nWe're gonna go over the erase,\nknife, and scissors tool,\n\n49\n00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:45.580\nokay, all of these things right over here.\n\n50\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.350\nCuz they do different things,\nobviously, cuz they're different tools.\n\n51\n00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.860\nSo what do they do?\n\n52\n00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.010\nAnd I'm gonna click off of everything so\nyou can see this.\n\n53\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.300\nWhen I have my eraser tool,\nyou think it erases things, right?\n\n54\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.860\nAnd that's exactly what it does.\n\n55\n00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.500\nBut I wanted to show you how it works with\nclosed paths versus open paths, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.580\nSo if I have this closed path,\nyou can see that there's like, well, you\n\n57\n00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.020\ncan't really see it too well, but I got\na little circle with a crosshair over it.\n\n58\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.797\nBecause it does have a diameter just\nlike you would have an eraser in some of\n\n59\n00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:21.897\nyour other products, like Photoshop,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n60\n00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:24.528\nAnd if I just take this, and\nI'm not holding Shift or anything,\n\n61\n00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:26.005\nI'm just gonna kinda freehand it.\n\n62\n00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:30.745\nIf I just click, hold and drag and\njust kind of drag all the way through,\n\n63\n00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:35.090\nthrough this shape,\nyou could see that it's actually cutting,\n\n64\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.514\nif you wanna say, or erasing whatever\nis between that open path and\n\n65\n00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:42.810\nclose, sorry, that's not an open path.\n\n66\n00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.650\n>> Right.\n>> I just told you that\n\n67\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.330\nthat's a closed path.\n\n68\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.455\nThat is so a closed path.\n\n69\n00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:50.500\n[LAUGH] And I'm trying to show you that\nwhen you use the eraser on a closed path\n\n70\n00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.780\nit makes a closed path.\n\n71\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.740\n>> So it didn't leave you with two open\npaths like you might have thought,\n\n72\n00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.410\nit actually said, all right I'm gonna\ngo ahead and close these two halves up.\n\n73\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.490\n>> Exactly, yeah, so it's still\njust saying, okay, here you are,\n\n74\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.480\nyou are going to be closed off, okay.\n\n75\n00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.027\nLet's give another example so\nmaybe you can see this.\n\n76\n00:04:08.027 --> 00:04:14.304\nIf I take the eraser tool here, okay,\nand I just take and erase this, right.\n\n77\n00:04:14.304 --> 00:04:16.614\nI'm kind of erasing that thinking okay,\n\n78\n00:04:16.614 --> 00:04:21.237\nwell I'm gonna make this an open path with\na fill, so it's gonna be one whole path.\n\n79\n00:04:21.237 --> 00:04:23.322\nNo, you see how it actually\nbrings it back, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:23.322 --> 00:04:26.194\n>> Right.\n>> But see if I get it there, it's still\n\n81\n00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:32.261\nclosing it off enough, so you can see that\nit will always close off your closed path.\n\n82\n00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.710\n>> Okay.\n>> That's just kinda what it does.\n\n83\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.476\nAnd it does have a diameter, okay,\nso that's something to watch for.\n\n84\n00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:41.780\nIf you wanted to change the diameter\nof your eraser, I use my hotkeys,\n\n85\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.820\nthe bracket keys, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.960\nSame as in Photoshop,\n\n87\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.610\nyou can right bracket up and\nyou see how it makes the diameter bigger?\n\n88\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.070\nLeft bracket makes it smaller.\n\n89\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.400\nYou could also double-click on\nyour tool and you can go ahead and\n\n90\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.010\nchange the size of it.\n\n91\n00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.969\nAnd you can also see that it can be a\nrandom size, I'm not sure if I want that.\n\n92\n00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.797\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the angle on the roundness,\n\n93\n00:05:02.797 --> 00:05:05.194\nit doesn't have to be a perfect circle for\n\n94\n00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:07.877\nyour eraser,\nyou can do other things, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:07.877 --> 00:05:09.988\nBut that's basically what it does.\n\n96\n00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:14.826\nSo if I wanna create a big open space,\nif you wanna say I wannna cut it out\n\n97\n00:05:14.826 --> 00:05:18.769\nwith my eraser,\nthen that's what the eraser tool does.\n\n98\n00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:23.410\nAnd it will work on a closed, sorry,\nI keep mixing this up, don't I?\n\n99\n00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.243\n>> Easy to do.\n\n100\n00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:30.343\n>> This open path, see if I erase,\nit's just gonna take out an entire\n\n101\n00:05:30.343 --> 00:05:35.190\nsection of that open path and still just\ngive me the pieces of that open path.\n\n102\n00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.550\n>> So, basically, with the eraser,\nif it starts as an open path it stays.\n\n103\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.340\nIf it starts as a closed path,\nit'll remain a closed path.\n\n104\n00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.291\n>> Yes, perfect, good job [LAUGH].\n\n105\n00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:46.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, now, you also have the knife and\n\n106\n00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.690\nthe scissors.\n\n107\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.660\nNow, the knife is not extremely accurate,\nokay, but it does what it does.\n\n108\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.440\nSo let me go through this.\n\n109\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.290\nIt basically will cut through something,\nbut\n\n110\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.290\nit's not gonna give you a gap like\nyou have with the eraser tool, okay.\n\n111\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.918\nLet's go with this.\n\n112\n00:06:05.918 --> 00:06:09.396\nYou don't have to have it selected, if you\nhave it selected, you're basically saying,\n\n113\n00:06:09.396 --> 00:06:11.850\nI don't want you to cut anything else but\nthe thing that I have.\n\n114\n00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.680\nBut I wanted to show you\nthat it works without it.\n\n115\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.540\nSo if have this knife and I click,\nhold and drag, and you can see\n\n116\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.550\neven if I hold my Shift key, which I'm\ndoing right now, it doesn't stay straight.\n\n117\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.170\nIt just cuts it, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.300\nBut do you see how it does not make\nthat space that the Eraser tool did?\n\n119\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.890\nSo, if I go back to my black arrow tool,\nyou can see, and I clicked off first.\n\n120\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:39.610\nYou see how it's creating,\nit's cutting it, not very accurately,\n\n121\n00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.000\nand it's making that closed\npath with a closed path.\n\n122\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.420\n>> Right, kinda makes sense.\n\n123\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.650\nSo I'm thinking of the eraser with my\nkindergarten pencil, big fat thing.\n\n124\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.723\nIt's gonna leave a pretty\nwide swath through there.\n\n125\n00:06:51.723 --> 00:06:54.910\nBut if I take that really sharp knife edge\nand cut through that, it's nice and fine.\n\n126\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.161\n>> Yes [LAUGH],\nthat's a great description, thank you.\n\n127\n00:06:59.161 --> 00:07:02.006\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then just really quickly,\n\n128\n00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:03.637\ncome on over here.\n\n129\n00:07:03.637 --> 00:07:08.369\nI had selected this thing\nthat I got over here now.\n\n130\n00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:10.220\nAnd I just wanna show you that if\nI take this knife and cut through,\n\n131\n00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.870\nit's only gonna cut.\n\n132\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.632\nSee I went all the way across, see I\nknifed all the way through these shapes.\n\n133\n00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:18.594\nBut because I had selected\nthat one on the left,\n\n134\n00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:21.730\nits not going to cut through anything but\nthat.\n\n135\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.235\n>> Convenient.\n\n136\n00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:27.490\n>> So you can select an item before,\nor if you don't have it selected,\n\n137\n00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.675\nthen its just gonna go ahead and\ndo everything, just like that.\n\n138\n00:07:30.675 --> 00:07:34.890\nSo nothing selected first, so\njust kind of throwing that out there.\n\n139\n00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:40.470\nWith the knife,\nthe knife doesn't like to cut open paths.\n\n140\n00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.570\nSo if I take this, and I try to cut it,\nit just doesn't do that.\n\n141\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.810\nThe way I always used to\ndescribe this it's like,\n\n142\n00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:53.360\nI think of spaghetti or hair, right?\n\n143\n00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.360\nYou don't take a knife and\ncut your hair with it.\n\n144\n00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.225\nBut you could take some scissors and\nit just snaps it right off.\n\n145\n00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:02.824\n>> So I'm gonna guess that the scissors\ntool would work with our open paths.\n\n146\n00:08:02.824 --> 00:08:03.773\n>> It does.\n\n147\n00:08:03.773 --> 00:08:05.871\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It actually works with both, but\n\n148\n00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:10.220\nthat's one thing specifically with open\npaths like why won't the knife work?\n\n149\n00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.540\nIt's because you don't use\na knife to cut a string.\n\n150\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.775\nNow we're getting off.\n\n151\n00:08:15.775 --> 00:08:18.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You get the idea.\n\n152\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.590\nSo with the scissors, the scissors is\ngoing to take something like this and\n\n153\n00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.660\nit's not going to create the hole\nlike we did with the eraser, and\n\n154\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.480\nif I click on this Open\npath right in the middle.\n\n155\n00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.170\nI'm gonna toggle back to my black here\ntill I hit the V key right there.\n\n156\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:38.140\nAnd you see that now,\nI have two separate paths with that\n\n157\n00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:43.300\nscissors that I cut an open path in half\nor whatever increment that you want to.\n\n158\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.140\nBut it does work on closed paths, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.840\nSo, if I took this square and\nI took my scissors tool right here and\n\n160\n00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.540\nI went like right,\nit doesn't have to be on a specific point.\n\n161\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.860\nBut if I clicked right there and\nthen I clicked right there, so\n\n162\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.420\nI clicked on the actual path.\n\n163\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.570\nI'm not gonna click in the fill,\ncuz it doesn't work with fills.\n\n164\n00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.630\nIt's the path itself.okay,\n\n165\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.780\nswitch back to the black arrow\ntool with the toggle with the V.\n\n166\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.780\nAnd you see how it just cut that path.\n\n167\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.100\nBut now in this sense,\nthis is now an open path.\n\n168\n00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.760\nSo scissors can take a closed path and\ncut it, and\n\n169\n00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.680\nit's still a whole path\nbecause it's one path.\n\n170\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.860\nBecause it's not a straight one segment,\nit will allow for a fill in that space.\n\n171\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.170\nIt's just not closed off anymore.\n\n172\n00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.580\nThis is an open path\n\n173\n00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.950\nwith a fill which is weird because\nI said open paths don't have fills.\n\n174\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:45.330\nYeah, well that's because if it's just\na single segment, one segment two points.\n\n175\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.170\nTwo single points on one path,\nthere, you can't have a fill.\n\n176\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.140\nOkay?\n>> Interesting.\n\n177\n00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.450\n>> But if I start adding, if I took this\nand added more points and made any type of\n\n178\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.340\nangle where there could be a fill, then it\nwould actually take on a fill property.\n\n179\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.610\nSo that's, yeah,\nI guess that would be a little confusing.\n\n180\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.710\nLike, but you said no.\n\n181\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.030\n>> Yeah, that makes sense though.\n\n182\n00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.600\nSo it doesn't really have to\nbe completely closed to fill.\n\n183\n00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.910\nBut you can have something to fil.l it's\nkinda like to say you can't fill a line.\n\n184\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:17.970\nBut if you take that line and bend it and\nmake it into a bowl now you can fill it.\n\n185\n00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.928\n>> That's another great example [LAUGH]\n>> A good teacher.\n\n186\n00:10:20.928 --> 00:10:22.535\nYeah you are just batting\na thousand over here.\n\n187\n00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:24.805\nBatting 1,000's good, right?\n\n188\n00:10:24.805 --> 00:10:25.555\n>> I think so.\n\n189\n00:10:25.555 --> 00:10:28.205\n>> Okay, is that how that saying goes?\n\n190\n00:10:28.205 --> 00:10:30.775\nI don't know, all right, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:31.935\n>> Megan's our resident baseball.\n\n192\n00:10:31.935 --> 00:10:33.275\nAnd she's giving us the thumbs up.\n\n193\n00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:36.295\nBut she's the baseball expert.\n\n194\n00:10:36.295 --> 00:10:37.995\nI think that's perfect.\n\n195\n00:10:37.995 --> 00:10:39.455\n>> Yeah, I'm a hockey fan.\n\n196\n00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:40.830\nSo yeah, so yes.\n\n197\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.500\n>> Go hockey.\n\n198\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.652\n>> We'll go points per game.\n\n199\n00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:47.270\n>> All right now actually talking\nabout those points, right,\n\n200\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.400\nwe say that a line segment,\na line has two points.\n\n201\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.440\nThere is another command that I want\nto show you, that's the join command.\n\n202\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.150\nSo what do you think a join means?\n\n203\n00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.930\nWe are going to join.\n\n204\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.610\n>> Two paths.\n\n205\n00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.170\nPoints, yes, points on a path.\n\n206\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.240\n>> Thousand batting average.\n\n207\n00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.450\n>> You're fired,\nyou're kicked off the team.\n\n208\n00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.590\nSo let's come down here,\nI'm gonna zoom into here.\n\n209\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.420\nSo this guy right here I've got a path,\n\n210\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.490\nand I've got a point, now black arrows for\nthe whole path, the white arrows for\n\n211\n00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:22.490\nthe point, or the piece of the point,\npiece of the It's for the piece, okay.\n\n212\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.990\nIf I take this point right here and\nI want to join it with this, right.\n\n213\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.090\nNow to select multiple things or\nyou hold your shift key.\n\n214\n00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.540\nSo I'm gonna shift click.\n\n215\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.590\nSo you can see here that\nthat's my selected point.\n\n216\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.610\nThat's my selected point.\n\n217\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.540\nAs opposed to the hollow dot.\n\n218\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.080\nThe hollow dot means it's not selected.\n\n219\n00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.500\nSo just trying to show\nyou that differentiation.\n\n220\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.590\nI got my two points and\n\n221\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:50.150\nif I go to my object menu and\nyou go to path, you go to join.\n\n222\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.712\nBecause this is the old school\nway before they had icons and\n\n223\n00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.180\nall different things like that.\n\n224\n00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.440\nYou can go to path join or\na command of Ctrl+J and\n\n225\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.880\nyou can see that it actually joined\ninto a nice little lightening bolt.\n\n226\n00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.540\n>> Perfect.\n\n227\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.690\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n228\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.245\n>> Go Bolts.\n>> [LAUGH] Definitely.\n\n229\n00:12:05.245 --> 00:12:06.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.040\n>> So we've got our points on our path,\n\n231\n00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.080\nand that's how you can join them.\n\n232\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.830\nSo I could take these, and notice one\nthing here, I can click, hold, and\n\n233\n00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.730\ndrag when I make a marquee selection.\n\n234\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.010\nYou can do the same thing with\nyour white arrow tool with points.\n\n235\n00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.260\nSo if I click, hold, and drag,\nI know that that selector marquee is\n\n236\n00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.480\ngonna grab those two points but\nnow there's no other points on this paths.\n\n237\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.970\nI grab those two and\n\n238\n00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:31.060\nthen I can do that command J and\nit will go ahead and now have this.\n\n239\n00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.020\nThis is now a whole path.\n\n240\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.780\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay.\n\n241\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.400\nIt's open still but\nit's a whole path, okay.\n\n242\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.040\nAnd just for fun It will take on a fill.\n\n243\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.050\nLike you said, the bolt, right?\n\n244\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:49.400\nSo you've got a space for\nsomething to have a fill and an open path.\n\n245\n00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.980\nThat's the join command in Illustrator.\n\n246\n00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.860\nThere's something new in\nCC that's pretty sweet.\n\n247\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.370\nI've got multiple art boards over here so\nlet me show you.\n\n248\n00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:07.620\nThis guy on this third art board,\nthese are three individual segments, okay.\n\n249\n00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.070\nSo you can see, one, two, three and\n\n250\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.530\nI want to make this one whole path.\n\n251\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:24.270\nSo I'm gonna select the guys that I want\nand if you go over here to the join tool\n\n252\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:30.030\nit's hiding in with the pencils and\nshape builder tool.\n\n253\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.060\nSo I got this and\nactually they deselected but\n\n254\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.630\nthat's okay because I wanted to show you.\n\n255\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.390\nI just take this and kind of take that,\nyou see how it actually takes\n\n256\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.550\nwhere two paths overlap and\nyou can say, just take that out.\n\n257\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.900\nIts really really cool.\n\n258\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.870\nSo i just say okay now i don't\nwant you guys so i take that out.\n\n259\n00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.105\nIts kind of like nope i don't want you.\n\n260\n00:13:50.105 --> 00:13:52.645\nIt's almost like an eraser joiner tool.\n\n261\n00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:53.415\n>> Wow.\n>> Because\n\n262\n00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:56.195\nnow if I go back to the black arrow tool,\nthis is one whole path.\n\n263\n00:13:56.195 --> 00:13:56.805\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n264\n00:13:56.805 --> 00:13:59.005\n>> Yeah.\nIt's super, super cool.\n\n265\n00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:02.125\nAnd just to show one other thing.\n\n266\n00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:05.425\nIf I took this and, whoops,\nsorry I double-clicked on it.\n\n267\n00:14:05.425 --> 00:14:08.595\nSo if I took this and\nkind of went a little farther off.\n\n268\n00:14:08.595 --> 00:14:10.270\nSee, they're not overlapping each other?\n\n269\n00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n270\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.970\nI can still take that join tool and\nI can say,\n\n271\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.430\njust kinda get these two together and\nit will join them.\n\n272\n00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.040\nSo, they're in close proximity\nto each other, just like I had\n\n273\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.100\nin the first example, selected two\nof the points and said join them.\n\n274\n00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.720\nThis join tool just like go together.\n\n275\n00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.840\nIt's really, really neat.\n\n276\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.460\nSo you can take all of those you can,\nyou know draw your line segments with your\n\n277\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.090\nline tool and then use this command\nto kind of put them all together.\n\n278\n00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.220\n>> Very cool.\n>> And make one whole path,\n\n279\n00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.020\nwhether it's closed or open,\nit doesn't matter but it's one path.\n\n280\n00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.130\n>> Nice.\n>> So, yeah, super neat and\n\n281\n00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.430\nthat's new in CC.\n\n282\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.700\n>> Very good.\n\n283\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.130\n>> Nice.\n>> And let me correct myself,\n\n284\n00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.310\nI think I said that Megan was our resident\nbaseball expert and it's not Megan.\n\n285\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.185\nIt's Ashley.\n\n286\n00:14:52.185 --> 00:14:53.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So Ashley's manning the switcher\n\n287\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.430\nfor us tonight.\n\n288\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.173\nAnd she is a baseball fanatic.\n\n289\n00:14:56.173 --> 00:14:57.600\nSo [LAUGH]\n>> Nice.\n\n290\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.260\nI'm glad that she's here to keep\nus in check because obviously we\n\n291\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.008\ndon't know anything about baseball.\n\n292\n00:15:02.008 --> 00:15:02.516\n[LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n293\n00:15:02.516 --> 00:15:03.614\n[LAUGH] >> So.\n>> So thank you for\n\n294\n00:15:03.614 --> 00:15:04.574\nthat Ashley.\n>> Yeah,\n\n295\n00:15:04.574 --> 00:15:06.544\nlet's not start talking about hockey.\nThen I'll.\n\n296\n00:15:06.544 --> 00:15:07.729\n>> I'll go forever.\n\n297\n00:15:07.729 --> 00:15:10.210\n[LAUGH] All right so\n\n298\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.220\nlet's move on to the path finder panel.\n\n299\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.000\nBecause this is the name of the file right\nso I've obviously named it for a reason.\n\n300\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.720\nThe path finder, it is a panel\nlike I just said so let's go and\n\n301\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.450\nfind it in our window menu so\nI can at least pull it up for you.\n\n302\n00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.140\nIt doesn't find paths.\n\n303\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.210\nOkay, actually where we could find\npaths would be in layers panel but\n\n304\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.062\nit's a very misleading statement.\n\n305\n00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:32.567\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like why did you named as a path\n\n306\n00:15:32.567 --> 00:15:33.449\nfinding panel.\n\n307\n00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:36.465\nI just honestly I don't really\nknow I think path finding panel.\n\n308\n00:15:36.465 --> 00:15:41.705\nBut it is a way that you can start\ncombining shapes together, okay.\n\n309\n00:15:41.705 --> 00:15:47.015\nAnd if you hover, because we have a tool\ntips, so you can see that this is Unite,\n\n310\n00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:49.332\nthis is Minus Front, this is Intersect.\n\n311\n00:15:49.332 --> 00:15:53.305\nAnd my zoom is not showing you,\nbut this is exclude.\n\n312\n00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:55.548\nAnd you can see by these\nlittle icons that,\n\n313\n00:15:55.548 --> 00:15:58.422\nokay well obviously I think\nI get what Unite and Minus.\n\n314\n00:15:58.422 --> 00:15:59.087\n>> Kinda shows you, yeah.\n\n315\n00:15:59.087 --> 00:16:02.095\n>> Yeah, okay, so where they intersect\nis gonna leave me what it is.\n\n316\n00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:08.295\nAnd so, this top buttons are going to\nbe how you can combine shapes, okay?\n\n317\n00:16:08.295 --> 00:16:12.879\nSo for example, here,\nif I have this, right, and\n\n318\n00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:16.292\nif I took these two shapes right here,\n\n319\n00:16:16.292 --> 00:16:20.897\nI got the smart guys\nI'm a little off okay.\n\n320\n00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:21.640\nLet go, let go.\n\n321\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.009\n[LAUGH] Just demonstrate, okay.\n\n322\n00:16:24.009 --> 00:16:26.794\nOr I'll be here all night\naligning everything.\n\n323\n00:16:26.794 --> 00:16:31.753\nIf I take these three paths,\nthese three closed paths that is,\n\n324\n00:16:31.753 --> 00:16:35.792\nokay, and I took them and\nI wanted to combine them.\n\n325\n00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:38.416\nNow, since we are in Florida, that is?\n\n326\n00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:39.089\n>> That's Mickey Mouse.\n\n327\n00:16:39.089 --> 00:16:42.179\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, maybe everybody,\n\n328\n00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:43.425\nI don't know.\n\n329\n00:16:43.425 --> 00:16:46.606\nWe're Floridians so\nthat's automatically what we think of.\n\n330\n00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:48.701\nSo that becomes our Mickey Mouse.\n\n331\n00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:52.280\nI took my three shapes and I combined\nthem and now this is one whole path.\n\n332\n00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.040\nYou can see it says path and I can\nchange and do whatever I want with it.\n\n333\n00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.540\nOkay.\n>> Mm.\n\n334\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.680\n>> That's how that works.\n\n335\n00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.483\nIf, just for fun, if I took these two\nguys right here and then I wanted to,\n\n336\n00:17:03.483 --> 00:17:08.674\nsince they are in the, notice that these\ntwo shapes are in the front of this one,\n\n337\n00:17:08.674 --> 00:17:13.659\nsince we can see it, if I take this\nIt's almost like a hole puncher.\n\n338\n00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:18.935\nIt doesn't have to just be one, but they\ndo have to be overlapping closed paths.\n\n339\n00:17:18.935 --> 00:17:20.285\nThat's something to keep in mind.\n\n340\n00:17:20.285 --> 00:17:23.647\nOverlapping closed paths.\n\n341\n00:17:23.647 --> 00:17:25.995\nI think you can get the idea that, woops,\n\n342\n00:17:25.995 --> 00:17:29.800\nthat doesn't allow you to do more\nthan one, so let's go with here.\n\n343\n00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.010\nOkay so these two shapes,\nyou can see this leaves that, and\n\n344\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.450\nI think you get the idea of goes ahead and\nknocks a hole out of this,\n\n345\n00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.710\nwhich we'll get to a little bit more\nabout of what this is actually doing.\n\n346\n00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.130\nIts making a group when you do\nit through the shape modes, but\n\n347\n00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:48.130\nknocking holes out of overlapping paths\nis something known as compound paths,\n\n348\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.630\nwhich we'll get into into\njust a little bit, but\n\n349\n00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:54.100\nbefore we get into compound paths,\nI did want to point out one thing.\n\n350\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.106\nAbout these shape modes and\nhow you can use it as the compound\n\n351\n00:17:59.106 --> 00:18:05.014\nshape because if you hover over it,\nit gives you this little tooltip,\n\n352\n00:18:05.014 --> 00:18:10.020\nit says,\noption click to create a compound shape.\n\n353\n00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.700\nThat a mouthful.\n\n354\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.400\nOkay, what is that mean?\n\n355\n00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.079\nLet's go with the unite,\nI think that's the easiest one to show,\n\n356\n00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:21.612\nwhen I don't have anything down, it just\nmake the whole path like we said, if I ALT\n\n357\n00:18:21.612 --> 00:18:26.082\nor option click on this button, it creates\nwhat still looks like a Mickey Mouse,\n\n358\n00:18:26.082 --> 00:18:28.608\nlooking more like a bear\nright now actually.\n\n359\n00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:29.791\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n360\n00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:32.183\n>> But this bear we got going on here.\n\n361\n00:18:32.183 --> 00:18:35.540\nIt's saying over here, whoops.\n\n362\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.146\nSorry.\n\n363\n00:18:37.146 --> 00:18:38.423\nI did the wrong shortcuts over there.\n\n364\n00:18:38.423 --> 00:18:40.730\n[LAUGH] It says compound shape.\n\n365\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.950\nIt's not a path anymore.\n\n366\n00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.580\nWhat does that mean?\n\n367\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.260\nIt is uniting, but it's not fully merging,\nif you want to say.\n\n368\n00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.553\nIt is not one path, and\nyou can almost see it.\n\n369\n00:18:52.553 --> 00:18:53.551\nYou can see the outlines.\n\n370\n00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:56.292\n>> You still see the individual paths\nwith the original closed path items.\n\n371\n00:18:56.292 --> 00:18:57.900\n>> Yeah.\nAnd if you can see them,\n\n372\n00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.311\nwhat do you think you can do?\n\n373\n00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:00.866\n>> Probably edit them, move them.\n\n374\n00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:03.467\n>> Yes, yes, so I could take this.\n\n375\n00:19:03.467 --> 00:19:05.530\nAnd how do I get into that?\n\n376\n00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.700\nI go into isolation mode.\n\n377\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.510\nSo if I double click into here,\nso I can get into here.\n\n378\n00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.860\nAnd see, I could go ahead and\nbring these out and\n\n379\n00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.400\nmake them a little bit\nmore Mickey Mouse like.\n\n380\n00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.650\nNow we got a mouse.\n\n381\n00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.164\nIt's not a bear anymore.\n\n382\n00:19:19.164 --> 00:19:23.765\nSo that's a neat feature of,\nyou still see it and\n\n383\n00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:27.140\nit still behaves like a whole path.\n\n384\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.660\nBut it really is a compound shape.\n\n385\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.550\nSo that's something interesting.\n\n386\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.122\nAnd just to show you in the Layers Panel\ncuz I like the Layers Panel.\n\n387\n00:19:35.122 --> 00:19:36.730\nWow, I got a whole bunch\nof stuff down here.\n\n388\n00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:37.530\nYou see right there?\n\n389\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.504\nIt actually says compound shape.\n\n390\n00:19:40.504 --> 00:19:41.600\nIt's hard to see.\n\n391\n00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.340\nBut if I expand that out, you see\nthose are my three circles in there.\n\n392\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.873\nSo it doesn't actually\nsay that it's a shape.\n\n393\n00:19:48.873 --> 00:19:52.550\nBut now if I took this and\nI actually did want to combine it,\n\n394\n00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.378\nthere's actually something if\nI wanted this to be for real,\n\n395\n00:19:56.378 --> 00:20:00.876\nthere's something known as Expand and\nit's not gonna let me do it.\n\n396\n00:20:00.876 --> 00:20:03.590\nWell that's a spheric appearance\nhow would you do that?\n\n397\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.401\nThere we go, all right.\n[LAUGH] That works enough though.\n\n398\n00:20:07.401 --> 00:20:08.933\n>> Now, it's just one path.\n\n399\n00:20:08.933 --> 00:20:09.675\n>> Yes.\n\n400\n00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:12.360\nIt's actually, Tommy, it's a group but\nthen we can go ahead.\n\n401\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.830\nAnd actually if it's a group,\n\n402\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.320\nthen I can actually use the unite\nthen I know it's a real path.\n\n403\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.169\nOkay.\nSo actually,\n\n404\n00:20:17.169 --> 00:20:19.380\nthey had to take two steps to do that one.\n\n405\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.810\nI have to expand the appearance, which\nwe'll go over appearance in another time.\n\n406\n00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.475\nBut I had expand it,\nthat was the only option it gave me.\n\n407\n00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:27.505\nAnd then I unite it, and\nthen it becomes a whole path.\n\n408\n00:20:27.505 --> 00:20:29.955\n>> Gotcha.\n>> Okay, so there wasn't any option or\n\n409\n00:20:29.955 --> 00:20:32.379\nAlt clicking on the Shape Modes button.\n\n410\n00:20:32.379 --> 00:20:35.480\nOkay, so that is our shape modes.\n\n411\n00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.360\nNow I didn't go over these bottom\nones here in the path finder.\n\n412\n00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.910\nThey have the same things,\nthe divide, trim, merge, crop.\n\n413\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.050\nI think the one to show you, because we\ncan go through every single one of them.\n\n414\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.505\nBut really just take two shapes and\nsee what it does.\n\n415\n00:20:47.505 --> 00:20:49.783\nBecause it makes sense like trim,\n\n416\n00:20:49.783 --> 00:20:54.571\nit's gonna trim out what parts of\na merge but they're not and this your,\n\n417\n00:20:54.571 --> 00:20:59.201\nand a lot of them, you're actually\njust dividing, if you wanna say,\n\n418\n00:20:59.201 --> 00:21:04.407\nyou're not really merging, so here's\nthe example I was like to show, okay?\n\n419\n00:21:04.407 --> 00:21:09.584\nThese two circle and square, thats not a.\n\n420\n00:21:09.584 --> 00:21:10.948\n>> Or star\n>> Or a star, I was like,\n\n421\n00:21:10.948 --> 00:21:12.632\nare you going to catch that?\n\n422\n00:21:12.632 --> 00:21:18.284\nAll right, so you've got this, and\nif I select these two together,\n\n423\n00:21:18.284 --> 00:21:21.415\nall right, and I go with this divide.\n\n424\n00:21:21.415 --> 00:21:25.649\nAlways watch that upper corner of your\ncontrol panels, it says its a group, so\n\n425\n00:21:25.649 --> 00:21:27.135\nit's always grouping it.\n\n426\n00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:31.765\nSo if I ungroup this, just to show you\nwhat it does, is now this, this, this,\n\n427\n00:21:31.765 --> 00:21:35.695\nit's actually dividing all the paths,\nit's finding the paths,\n\n428\n00:21:35.695 --> 00:21:40.466\nooh maybe thats why they call it pathing,\nso it's finding all the path and says,\n\n429\n00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:43.660\nlets divide it out and\nI can make these kind of things.\n\n430\n00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.183\nAnd if I was all in some really good\nalignments, that it looks kinda ool and\n\n431\n00:21:46.183 --> 00:21:48.764\nyou start to changing the colors and\nit's like, all right, there you go.\n\n432\n00:21:48.764 --> 00:21:55.600\nSo the divide is when I do actually use\nquite frequently for fun little designs.\n\n433\n00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.207\nSo that is the path finder panel.\n\n434\n00:21:59.207 --> 00:22:03.457\nWe talked about combined shapes in here,\nand I mentioned compound.\n\n435\n00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:04.780\nI didn't say [INAUDIBLE] I said compound.\n\n436\n00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.474\nMan, all these words\nare blending into one.\n\n437\n00:22:06.474 --> 00:22:08.007\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n438\n00:22:08.007 --> 00:22:09.099\n>> Compound shapes.\n\n439\n00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:10.330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n440\n00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.740\n>> Now let's talk about a compound path,\nokay?\n\n441\n00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.050\nYou see compound paths\na lot in Illustrator\n\n442\n00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.340\ndown the road when we start getting\ninto outline texts and everything,\n\n443\n00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.120\nso, it comes up more frequently\nthan you probably are going to\n\n444\n00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.220\nrealize at first because at first, you're\nlike, okay, just knock out the holes.\n\n445\n00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.730\nBut just watch it,\nthey'll creep up on you and so\n\n446\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.600\nit's really important to understand\nwhat exactly is it, okay.\n\n447\n00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.070\nA compound path is where you\ntake two overlapping path and\n\n448\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.110\nit will knock out the holes in between it,\nit's just minusing it.\n\n449\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:49.730\nSo, I have this little group, it's not\na group but it's four circles, okay.\n\n450\n00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:55.450\nAnd if I select them, you can see where\nthey're overlapping by when I select them.\n\n451\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.800\nSo if these two are overlapping,\n\n452\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.180\nthese two are overlapping, tadada, if I\nright click, you can make a compound path.\n\n453\n00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.360\nIf you don't know how to right click or\nI'm sorry,\n\n454\n00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.240\nif you don't like to right click,\nI should say that, it is in object menu.\n\n455\n00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.050\nSo you can go to object,\ncompound path, make.\n\n456\n00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.390\nAnd so when I go there, it creates holes.\n\n457\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.730\nBut I said it's creating holes\nout of each overlapping path.\n\n458\n00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.470\nThat didn't do it, did it?\n\n459\n00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.830\nCuz these two are overlapping.\n\n460\n00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:23.790\nThese two are overlapping.\n\n461\n00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.570\nWhy aren't there any holes then?\n\n462\n00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:31.300\nThis is a little hidden\nsecret of compound pathing.\n\n463\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.770\nIt took me a while to figure this out.\n\n464\n00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.781\nSo, I'm gonna give you\nthe shortcut way to.\n\n465\n00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:35.570\n>> Share your wisdom.\n\n466\n00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.335\n>> Yes, I am here.\n\n467\n00:23:37.335 --> 00:23:41.847\n[LAUGH] So there's something\nknown as a zero winding fill and\n\n468\n00:23:41.847 --> 00:23:46.620\nan odd even fill when you're\ntalking about compound paths.\n\n469\n00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.250\nWhat is that?\n\n470\n00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.220\nOne gets all the holes, one doesn't.\n\n471\n00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.950\nThat's the easy way to say it.\n\n472\n00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:57.749\nWhere you control is where I found you\ncontrol it is in the Attributes panel.\n\n473\n00:23:57.749 --> 00:24:00.954\nSo if you go to this Attributes panel,\nand you have to show the options.\n\n474\n00:24:00.954 --> 00:24:04.097\nCuz we don't show the options,\nor show all in this sense.\n\n475\n00:24:04.097 --> 00:24:06.053\nIt's not gonna give you what you need.\n\n476\n00:24:06.053 --> 00:24:07.947\nSo here is my selected compound path.\n\n477\n00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:11.770\nIt's these two guys right here,\nthat one and that one.\n\n478\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.450\nSo you see it says\nUse Non-Zero Winding Fill.\n\n479\n00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.050\nOr I might have said zero,\nit's that thing.\n\n480\n00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.860\nAnd then there's this one,\nwhich is the Even-Odd Fill Rule.\n\n481\n00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.304\nOkay, that's the one you want to,\nbloop, there you go,\n\n482\n00:24:26.304 --> 00:24:31.586\nnow all of the overlapping paths\nare going to have knocked out holes.\n\n483\n00:24:31.586 --> 00:24:36.359\nI'm gonna close this,\nit's still keeping that,\n\n484\n00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:40.355\nit still sees that's it's four circles,\n\n485\n00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:44.698\nit's not merged completely\nit is still four.\n\n486\n00:24:44.698 --> 00:24:47.810\nNow I just know that because that's\nthe way compound paths work.\n\n487\n00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:52.700\nBut if I double-click on this you can see\nthat I'm inside of this compound path,\n\n488\n00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:58.090\nand if I start moving these you\nsee how it's going to keep itself.\n\n489\n00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.800\nSo if I take this, and\nthen this, and then this.\n\n490\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.620\nThen that's something.\n\n491\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.790\nAnd now notice right here,\nsee in this middle part right here?\n\n492\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.370\nThat's three overlapping paths.\n\n493\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.260\n>> That's odd instead of even so.\n\n494\n00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.750\n>> And also it's three instead of two,\n\n495\n00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.310\ncuz the holes only come for\ntwo overlapping paths.\n\n496\n00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.950\nIf you have three, then it's not.\n\n497\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.386\n>> Yeah, okay.\n>> Yeah, that's the other thing.\n\n498\n00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:22.647\nSo, good guess, but close enough.\n\n499\n00:25:22.647 --> 00:25:24.235\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But not really.\n\n500\n00:25:24.235 --> 00:25:25.786\n[LAUGH] So it is, yeah,\n\n501\n00:25:25.786 --> 00:25:32.130\njust because it's two overlapping paths\nthat create the holes in a compound path.\n\n502\n00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.560\nSo I'm gonna double-click\nto get out of that.\n\n503\n00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.950\nAnd so that's what you've got.\n\n504\n00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.230\nNow, if you can make a compound path,\n\n505\n00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.660\nyou can also release it from\nits compound pathness, okay?\n\n506\n00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.470\nSo if I right-click on here,\nyou can see Release From Compound Path,\n\n507\n00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:51.240\nand it's still four separate circles,\nokay?\n\n508\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.170\nSo that's it's kind of a good thing, and\n\n509\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:26:00.720\nyou will see compound paths as a result\nof quite a few things in Illustrator.\n\n510\n00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.289\nSome different tools that we're gonna\nuse and outlining text that comes up.\n\n511\n00:26:05.289 --> 00:26:06.642\nSo just watch for it.\n\n512\n00:26:06.642 --> 00:26:10.410\nAlways watching that upper left hand\ncorner of, why is this happening or\n\n513\n00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.539\nhow is this working?\n\n514\n00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:15.630\nYou know it's a compound path and\nwhy and how it works.\n\n515\n00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.244\nKnocking holes out of\ntwo overlapping paths.\n\n516\n00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:17.763\n>> Very good.\n\n517\n00:26:17.763 --> 00:26:18.878\n>> Perfect.\n\n518\n00:26:18.878 --> 00:26:24.809\nSo we've got that, let's move on to\noutline stroke because I was actually\n\n519\n00:26:24.809 --> 00:26:31.600\ntalking about outlining text, which we\nhaven't gotten to the text just yet.\n\n520\n00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.816\nSo we'll go over that a little bit later,\nbut let's demonstrate over here, okay?\n\n521\n00:26:35.816 --> 00:26:37.699\nSo let say I have this.\n\n522\n00:26:37.699 --> 00:26:43.225\nI've got my circle, and\nI've got my open path, okay.\n\n523\n00:26:43.225 --> 00:26:47.030\nCome on, I'm going too fast,\nslow down, okay.\n\n524\n00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:55.310\nSo, I take this and I want to do what I\ndid with the Mickey Mouse bear guy, right.\n\n525\n00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.310\nI wanna use the Pathfinder panel.\n\n526\n00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:01.670\nSo I come over here and I go to Unite,\nand it does this weird thing,\n\n527\n00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.680\nit's what is that in the minus front and\nit's, what is going on here?\n\n528\n00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.390\nThey work with closed paths.\n\n529\n00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.040\nThis is not a closed path, is it?\n\n530\n00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.860\nIt's an open path, okay.\n\n531\n00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:19.013\nSo you can take strokes, something that\nhas a stroke, and you can outline it,\n\n532\n00:27:19.013 --> 00:27:23.327\nbasically making this into a closed\npath instead of an open path.\n\n533\n00:27:23.327 --> 00:27:27.172\nAnd I wanted to throw in something\nthat I thinkIi actually forgot in\n\n534\n00:27:27.172 --> 00:27:28.280\nanother episode.\n\n535\n00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.320\nSo I wanted to throw this in here now.\n\n536\n00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.695\nI wanna throw in the width tool, okay.\n\n537\n00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:38.304\nBecause, we did talk about\nthe width profiles like here.\n\n538\n00:27:38.304 --> 00:27:40.900\nWell let me go ahead and select that\nfirst so we can go ahead and apply.\n\n539\n00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.520\nWe talked about these different width\nprofiles because you can have different\n\n540\n00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.474\nvarying width, Strokes.\n\n541\n00:27:48.474 --> 00:27:51.560\n[LAUGH] Within one stroke, okay.\n\n542\n00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.190\nAnd these are just kinda pre-made ones.\n\n543\n00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.920\nBut you do have the seahorse tool,\nas I call it, or\n\n544\n00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.680\nthe width tool, that you can take here.\n\n545\n00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:06.880\nAnd if you have this one stroke,\nyou can make points on that,\n\n546\n00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.680\nand you can click, hold, and drag, and\nyou can actually change the width here.\n\n547\n00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.030\nAnd if I wanted to make another one and\nmake it a little smaller, and\n\n548\n00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.390\nthen take this one and\nmake it a little bigger.\n\n549\n00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.810\nAnd then maybe take this one and\nmake it a little smaller again.\n\n550\n00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:25.330\nSo you can actually make these\nwidth points on a stroke\n\n551\n00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.620\nand make your own width profile,\nif you want to say.\n\n552\n00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.200\nAnd it doesn't have to be an open path.\n\n553\n00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.347\nJust to show you that if I'm\nover here on a closed path, and\n\n554\n00:28:34.347 --> 00:28:37.496\nI go back to the width tool,\nyou see the way I can go ahead and\n\n555\n00:28:37.496 --> 00:28:40.353\nmake a point here and\nmake that something like that.\n\n556\n00:28:40.353 --> 00:28:42.405\nThat's kinda cool looking actually.\n\n557\n00:28:42.405 --> 00:28:45.597\nSo you can go ahead and\ndo things like that, so\n\n558\n00:28:45.597 --> 00:28:48.625\nit doesn't have to be just an open path.\n\n559\n00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:52.045\nBut that is the width tool,\nmaking width points, making it bigger.\n\n560\n00:28:52.045 --> 00:28:55.885\nSo, kinda back to where I was\ngoing with the outline stroke.\n\n561\n00:28:55.885 --> 00:28:59.875\nSo, if I've got this as a stroke but\nI want to make this into a shape,\n\n562\n00:28:59.875 --> 00:29:04.785\nlike a closed path, so I can merge it or\ndo whatever I want to do with it.\n\n563\n00:29:04.785 --> 00:29:08.042\nYou can have it selected,\nyou can go to the Object menu.\n\n564\n00:29:08.042 --> 00:29:11.451\nYou go to Path and\nyou go to Outline Stroke,\n\n565\n00:29:11.451 --> 00:29:15.260\njust like tracing\nthe outline of the stroke.\n\n566\n00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.400\nSo if I click it,\nnow you can see it becomes a closed path.\n\n567\n00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.400\nThe black that was the stroke when\nit was a open path is now the fill\n\n568\n00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.110\nof a closed path.\n\n569\n00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.170\nSo, that's kind of Fun there.\n\n570\n00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:34.860\nAnd then I can take this stroke, and\nI can do whatever I want with it.\n\n571\n00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.380\nI can use it to cut something out.\n\n572\n00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.490\nAnd so now I've got something like this,\nbecause I used the minus front,\n\n573\n00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:42.850\nbecause this now is a shape.\n\n574\n00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.450\nAnd so it creates this little\nguy going on right here.\n\n575\n00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.450\n>> Very cool.\n\n576\n00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.200\n>> Okay?\n\n577\n00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.800\nAll right, so that's outline stroke,\na few other little\n\n578\n00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.820\nguys here that we've got,\nthe shape builder tool.\n\n579\n00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:03.080\nThis is something that you can use to,\nwell, combine shapes.\n\n580\n00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.690\nDon't really know how else to say it\nbesides, that's the shape builder tool.\n\n581\n00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:10.340\nSo, if I wanted to take something like\nthis, let me get a fill on this so\n\n582\n00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.220\nthat we can see it.\n\n583\n00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.480\nI'm going to select these guys.\n\n584\n00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.825\nThis tool over here that's\nthe shaper tool, wrong one, sorry.\n\n585\n00:30:20.825 --> 00:30:24.880\nCuz there's a shape builder and\nthere's a shaper tool, they're different.\n\n586\n00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.220\nSo, the shape builder tool takes this and\n\n587\n00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.220\nif I hover over, it's taking all\nof those intersecting paths,\n\n588\n00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:36.000\nand it's saying, there's this part,\nthis part, that part, that part.\n\n589\n00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.960\nIt's almost like a cutting it all out in\na sense, but it's not really cutting.\n\n590\n00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:46.800\nAnd if I wanted to say have these\ntwo pieces right here work together.\n\n591\n00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.560\nCuz right now I have a plus\nsign on the mouse pointer.\n\n592\n00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:54.010\nI can just click, hold and drag across,\nand then it says, here is this one, okay.\n\n593\n00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.610\nAnd notice it turned orange, right?\n\n594\n00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.400\nWhy'd it turn orange?\n\n595\n00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.205\nBecause that's the color of the path,\nor the fill that I had before I started\n\n596\n00:31:01.205 --> 00:31:05.940\nusing the shape builder tool.\n\n597\n00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.000\nI get them all mixed up.\n\n598\n00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.210\nOkay, now what if I\nwanted to take away this.\n\n599\n00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.580\nYou can take it out by holding Alt or\nOption key here, and\n\n600\n00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.100\nit turns a little minus.\n\n601\n00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.800\nAnd I can say let's go ahead and\ntake this out, and\n\n602\n00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.070\nit minuses that,\nmaybe I want to minus this guy out.\n\n603\n00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.020\nHolding that Alt or Option.\n\n604\n00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.500\nMaybe I want to add these two in together.\n\n605\n00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.480\nSo you can start creating\nsome interesting thing.\n\n606\n00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.240\nI can hold that, that's actually\nmaking a compound path, right,\n\n607\n00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.200\ncuz it's knocking the holes out\nof these two overlapping things.\n\n608\n00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.300\nSo, then I can create some, right now,\n\n609\n00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.080\nsome pretty weird looking-\n>> Modern art?\n\n610\n00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.000\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n611\n00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.050\nBut again, you can see,\nlook it's still individual pieces.\n\n612\n00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:49.503\nSo when I do that shape builders,\nactually kinda cutting it all apart but\n\n613\n00:31:49.503 --> 00:31:52.507\nalso creating whatever\nthings that I need to do.\n\n614\n00:31:52.507 --> 00:31:55.293\nKind of a fun little tool that\nyou can play around with and\n\n615\n00:31:55.293 --> 00:31:57.550\ndo the things that you wanna do.\n\n616\n00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.450\nNow the shaper tool.\n\n617\n00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.522\nThe shaper tool is new.\n\n618\n00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:06.316\nAnd this is going to be really\ngood if you have a tablet or\n\n619\n00:32:06.316 --> 00:32:09.671\nsome type of Graphics stylus or something?\n\n620\n00:32:09.671 --> 00:32:13.322\n>> Yeah, something with a stylus and\nyou could actually have a touch display,\n\n621\n00:32:13.322 --> 00:32:15.100\nthat's what I'm trying to go with.\n\n622\n00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.280\nThe Shaper tool is right there.\n\n623\n00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.340\nSo this is new.\n\n624\n00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.510\nIt's like, if I take my pencil, and\n\n625\n00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:27.340\nI wanna draw a circle it's not\ngoing to be very accurate, is it?\n\n626\n00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.400\nWell, if you do this with the Shaper tool\nand I click, hold and drag, and kinda,\n\n627\n00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.680\nlike, okay,\nthat's somewhat like a circle, right?\n\n628\n00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.520\nSo, it'll actually make a circle for me.\n\n629\n00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.220\n>> Wow.\n>> Or if I draw a square, okay,\n\n630\n00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.160\nand sometimes it's like okay,\nwhat is that?\n\n631\n00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.000\nOkay, I guess that's an ellipse or\nwhatever.\n\n632\n00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.490\nI want to draw a triangle.\n\n633\n00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.660\nSo, it will kind of detect\nwhat you're drawing.\n\n634\n00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.920\nAnd make that, okay?\n\n635\n00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.520\nSo I can do the straight lines, so\nit's actually going to draw your shapes.\n\n636\n00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.870\nI guess that's a hexagon,\nor whatever I did.\n\n637\n00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:58.865\n>> The circle was so bad.\n\n638\n00:32:58.865 --> 00:33:00.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it says, it's gotta be a hexagon.\n\n639\n00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's like, what are you doing?\n\n640\n00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.982\nSo, if I take here at, okay,\nI guess it's liking my hexagons,\n\n641\n00:33:07.982 --> 00:33:12.950\nand let's make a triangle,\ngood, okay, I drew a triangle.\n\n642\n00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:17.590\nAnd so you can see this, with this Shaper\ntool, I'm not changing tools right now.\n\n643\n00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.205\nI can, say all right,\n\n644\n00:33:19.205 --> 00:33:23.720\nwell I really wanted these two\npieces right here to take it out.\n\n645\n00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.247\nSo if I just kind of draw,\nsee it's like [SOUND],\n\n646\n00:33:26.247 --> 00:33:28.660\nI'm saying no, no, no, it's like erase.\n\n647\n00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:33.548\nOr if I wanted these two pieces to\nact as one I just kinda draw like\n\n648\n00:33:33.548 --> 00:33:37.530\na squiggly line across them and\nnow it becomes one.\n\n649\n00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:41.186\nMaybe I want this part\nto take things out and\n\n650\n00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:46.070\nthen I can, wait, there we go,\nwell, close enough.\n\n651\n00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.660\nSo okay, there we go, it takes it out.\n\n652\n00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.230\nBut still, you can see the dotted\nlines are still there.\n\n653\n00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:54.210\nSo it thinks that it's still,\nit's almost like the compound shape.\n\n654\n00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.080\nSo it's still there.\n\n655\n00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.910\nAnd I can say let's grab this guy.\n\n656\n00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.250\nAnd I'm not changing tools again.\n\n657\n00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:04.590\nAnd I can move this, and let's go\nahead and move this in a little bit.\n\n658\n00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.870\nMaybe I can round the little corners here.\n\n659\n00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:12.160\nSo it's a lot more lifelike and\nlife gesture like that you can do.\n\n660\n00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:18.810\nAnd so maybe I can come over here to\nthis guy right, come on, there we go.\n\n661\n00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:22.240\nAnd then I can move this or\nround the corners here.\n\n662\n00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.480\nAnd then I can kinda do that.\n\n663\n00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.560\nSo it's trying to mimic lifelike drawing.\n\n664\n00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.330\nWith one single tool, so\nyou don't have to keep going back.\n\n665\n00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.343\nYou don't have to do the pathfinder panel,\nyou don't have to make a compound path and\n\n666\n00:34:33.343 --> 00:34:35.757\ngo back and isolate it,\nit's all within one tool.\n\n667\n00:34:35.757 --> 00:34:39.904\nThat you can play around with and\nmake some drawings more natural,\n\n668\n00:34:39.904 --> 00:34:41.320\nI guess you could say.\n\n669\n00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.530\n>> Yeah, I can definitely see doing\nthis with a tablet and a stylus.\n\n670\n00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.010\n>> Yeah, a little harder for\nme with my mouse cuz it's,\n\n671\n00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.860\nI'm not doing what it's, I'm not exactly.\n\n672\n00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.930\nYeah, it's much harder to do that.\n\n673\n00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:54.690\nAnd I'm a little bit\nmore old school anyway.\n\n674\n00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.610\nSo that's how I roll, that's how I go.\n\n675\n00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:03.040\nAnd the last couple of little things that\nI wanted to show you, they're just fun.\n\n676\n00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.450\nI call them the Play Doh tools.\n\n677\n00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.189\nThey're not really called\nthe Play Doh tools.\n\n678\n00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.926\nHonestly, I not sure if I know\ntheir real names anymore.\n\n679\n00:35:09.926 --> 00:35:13.958\nThe warp tools over here,\nthe warp, all of these little guys.\n\n680\n00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:17.790\nSo, I have a selected path, let me go\nahead and move this over a little bit so\n\n681\n00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.370\nyou can see it.\n\n682\n00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:26.190\nThis warp tool, it's like taking\nyour finger and smudging it.\n\n683\n00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:32.750\nOkay, so if I take it from the outside and\njust drag it in I can pull it in there.\n\n684\n00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.140\nAnd if I come from the inside and\npull up, I can pull out.\n\n685\n00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.170\nAnd so,\nyou can do some really neat things.\n\n686\n00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.400\nThat's why I call it, it's like Play Doh.\n\n687\n00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.080\n>> I can see why you call\nit the Play Doh tool.\n\n688\n00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:47.431\n>> Right, remember taking it and squishing\nit, and expanding, and twirling it?\n\n689\n00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:50.011\n>> Yeah, all of these tools\nremind me of Play Doh, and\n\n690\n00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:52.910\nI loved playing with\nPlay Doh when I was a kid.\n\n691\n00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:57.440\nAnd it does have a diameter,\nlike the eraser, but you change\n\n692\n00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.340\nit by double clicking on the tool and\nyou can change the width and the height.\n\n693\n00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.830\nSo I could do something like that.\n\n694\n00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.220\nAnd it doesn't have to be the same.\n\n695\n00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.410\nOops, click OK.\n\n696\n00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:13.340\nAnd you see how it's a lot smaller now and\nso it's a much more exact\n\n697\n00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.210\narea that it's going to start\npulling things in or doing whatever.\n\n698\n00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.800\nThey can get the idea\nwith the rest of them.\n\n699\n00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.120\nPretty much just go down the line.\n\n700\n00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.510\nThe Twirl tool, it's kind of fun.\n\n701\n00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.889\nYou just click, hold, and [NOISE].\n\n702\n00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:25.364\nThat's it.\n[NOISE] You can make little curly cues,\n\n703\n00:36:25.364 --> 00:36:28.485\nyou can make some really weird\nblobby things coming out.\n\n704\n00:36:28.485 --> 00:36:29.950\nSo, that's kind of fun.\n\n705\n00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.800\nThe Pucker tool will\npucker together points.\n\n706\n00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.177\nSo, kind of [SOUND] sucks it in.\n\n707\n00:36:35.177 --> 00:36:36.802\nThat's a [SOUND] come on, suck it in.\n\n708\n00:36:36.802 --> 00:36:40.944\nThen you've got the, [LAUGH],\nI just saw you do that.\n\n709\n00:36:40.944 --> 00:36:41.689\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n710\n00:36:41.689 --> 00:36:44.017\nyou've got the Bloat tools\nkinda [NOISE] right?\n\n711\n00:36:44.017 --> 00:36:46.910\nSo you've gotta make the sound\neffects while you do it.\n\n712\n00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:47.865\n>> Absolutely.\n\n713\n00:36:47.865 --> 00:36:51.420\n>> [LAUGH] So you get some kind of,\nit just bloats it out.\n\n714\n00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.330\nThis little guy,\nthe Scallop tool will scallop the edges.\n\n715\n00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.098\nRight, this little guy,\nthe Crystallize is kinda fun.\n\n716\n00:36:58.098 --> 00:37:02.169\nIt's like [NOISE], it's kind of\nlike explosion, you just do that.\n\n717\n00:37:02.169 --> 00:37:06.342\nAnd then the Wrinkle tool\nwill just go ahead and\n\n718\n00:37:06.342 --> 00:37:11.053\nwrinkle the edges and\nnot make it straight anymore.\n\n719\n00:37:11.053 --> 00:37:14.581\nAnd then you get this, well I don't\neven know what this guy is, but\n\n720\n00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:16.780\nsome really weird blob amoeba thing.\n\n721\n00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.520\nSo, the the Play Doh tools\nthey're really fun and\n\n722\n00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.400\nit can create some like weird\norganic looking things.\n\n723\n00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.140\nAnd then the last guide\nthat I'd like to show you.\n\n724\n00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.890\nWow, we've really messed this pile up.\n\n725\n00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.300\nIs the Blob tool.\n\n726\n00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.350\nThis is where it's more like drawing and\n\n727\n00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:41.880\npainting to create organic, closed path.\n\n728\n00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.267\nAnd I'm just erasing some of this stuff so\nyou can see.\n\n729\n00:37:44.267 --> 00:37:48.070\nSo where is the Blob tool?\n\n730\n00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.840\nIt's over,\nit's under the paint brush, sorry.\n\n731\n00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.350\nSo we've got the Blob tool,\nright here, and\n\n732\n00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:56.950\nI'm just gonna show you that I'm going to\nmake this blue or something for my fill.\n\n733\n00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:02.090\nCuz it will create closed paths, okay.\n\n734\n00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:03.750\nSo it has a fill and a stroke.\n\n735\n00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:08.950\nSo if I maybe take this, right?\n\n736\n00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:10.980\nIt decides it's gonna be black,\nokay, that's fine.\n\n737\n00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.560\nAnd then I go ahead and\nthen kinda create this and that, and\n\n738\n00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.880\nthen maybe make some\nlittle deer looking guy.\n\n739\n00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.380\nI don't really know.\n\n740\n00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.890\nAnd so I'm just kind of drawing this out.\n\n741\n00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:25.170\nMedusa right?\n\n742\n00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:25.910\n>> Yes.\n\n743\n00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:27.985\n>> There we go, [SOUND], scary.\n\n744\n00:38:27.985 --> 00:38:31.060\nI need to stop.\n\n745\n00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.810\nSo if I go back to the black\narrow tool and I click on this.\n\n746\n00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:38.300\nDo you see that this is a whole path,\nit says it's a group but\n\n747\n00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.880\nI'll tell you why in a second.\n\n748\n00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.420\nSo I can just then change\nall of the fill color.\n\n749\n00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.510\nIt has a stroke around it, and\n\n750\n00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:50.190\nI can do all sorts of things that I\nreally would do with any other shape.\n\n751\n00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:56.790\nAnd it's just a little bit more\norganic looking and weird now.\n\n752\n00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:01.980\nAnd if I un-group this,\nyou can see that it's actually,\n\n753\n00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.930\nwhat did I say,\ncompound path look at that.\n\n754\n00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.860\nWhy is it a compound path, Mike?\n\n755\n00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.020\n>> Because it has more than\none path intersecting.\n\n756\n00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.340\n>> And it also has, what's this area?\n\n757\n00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.835\nIt's got a big old?\n\n758\n00:39:16.835 --> 00:39:17.355\n>> Hole.\n\n759\n00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.230\n>> Yes, it's a hole, yes.\n\n760\n00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.491\nIt creates a hole within two paths.\n\n761\n00:39:21.491 --> 00:39:23.752\n>> Yes, yes, I'm close.\n\n762\n00:39:23.752 --> 00:39:24.913\n>> You're on the right path.\n\n763\n00:39:24.913 --> 00:39:25.765\n>> Thank you.\n\n764\n00:39:25.765 --> 00:39:30.320\n>> Okay, so just to show you that\nif I release this compound path,\n\n765\n00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.410\nwhat it made when I was\ndrawing with that blob tool.\n\n766\n00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:38.680\nIt just made it in Illustrator's mind\nlike, there's a circle and I'm gonna cut\n\n767\n00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.870\nthe whole out of it, because you did not\ndraw within the Blob tool right middle.\n\n768\n00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.590\nSo that's again, see, compound paths,\nthey will show up a lot.\n\n769\n00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:47.690\n>> They pop up everywhere.\n\n770\n00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:48.630\n>> They will so,\n\n771\n00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:53.560\nI think that about covers everything that\nI wanted to cover with advanced shaping.\n\n772\n00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.840\n>> Fantastic,\nlot of great information there.\n\n773\n00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.343\nLot of really cool tools that we can use\nwhere we get into some of those later one,\n\n774\n00:39:59.343 --> 00:40:02.759\nthe Play Doh tools, as you like to call\nthem, the Warps and things like that.\n\n775\n00:40:02.759 --> 00:40:08.240\nAnd as well as the Blob brush we had,\nand then back towards the beginning.\n\n776\n00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.110\nLearning how to combine those shapes and\n\n777\n00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.420\nworking with the open paths\nas well as the closed paths.\n\n778\n00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.090\nSo fantastic, thank you for that Von.\n\n779\n00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.100\nHope everybody out there\nhas enjoyed watching.\n\n780\n00:40:17.100 -->

00:00:17.205\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:21.420\ntoday we're going to be doing\nAdobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.790\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\n\n6\n00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.500\nsome of the tools, more specifically\nwe're gonna be looking at the pen tool.\n\n7\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.940\nOne of the very important\ntools within illustrator.\n\n8\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.621\nHere to guide us through how to use\nthis pen tool successfully, here's Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:35.376\nVaughn Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:36.258\nHow is it going Vaughn?\n\n11\n00:00:36.258 --> 00:00:39.351\n>> Great, good to be back\nagain to tell you all about\n\n12\n00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:41.850\nthe fascinating world of the pen tool.\n\n13\n00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.040\nSo the pen tool is probably one of\nthe most important tools in Illustrator.\n\n14\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.960\nI'll probably say that about\nanother tool as well, but\n\n15\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.120\nI really do feel that the pen tool is\neverything that there is in Illustrator.\n\n16\n00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.330\nIt's all about creating paths,\nand mastering the pen yool\n\n17\n00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.240\nin all the ways that you can modify a path\nis extremely important in illustrator.\n\n18\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.820\nSo you need to become\na pen proficienado or\n\n19\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.480\nwe sure we can make some\nother fun little sayings.\n\n20\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.000\n>> A Pen professional.\n\n21\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.120\n>> A Pen professional.\n\n22\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.609\n>> Yes, there we go so.\n\n23\n00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:16.221\n>> Certification.\n\n24\n00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:17.732\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well it's gonna be important for\n\n25\n00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:19.337\ndedicating an entire episode to this guy.\n\n26\n00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:19.870\n>> Yes.\nYes.\n\n27\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.790\nSo, it's awesome.\n\n28\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.650\nIt can be a little scary,\nwhen I've taught this many, many years.\n\n29\n00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.800\nPeople are like I don't understand,\nit's going this way,\n\n30\n00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.220\nbut it's moving it that way and you're\npulling it up and it's going left and\n\n31\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.080\nright and it's like I don't understand.\n\n32\n00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.450\nSo, it does take awhile to get used to,\n\n33\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.670\nsome people see it right away like,\nI can get it all.\n\n34\n00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.460\nBut It sometimes it maybe\ntakes a little bit used to of\n\n35\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.706\nwhy am I doing up when it's going down or\nvice versa?\n\n36\n00:01:49.706 --> 00:01:51.177\n>> Okay.\nSo you're gonna explain all that\n\n37\n00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:51.760\nfor us, right?\n\n38\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.272\n>> I am.\n\n39\n00:01:52.272 --> 00:01:58.530\nSo I actually have this document ready to\ngo in illustrator that I've opened up.\n\n40\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.520\nSo these are basically all my notes for\nthis exercise, and so\n\n41\n00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.860\nyou can follow along with it,\nI'm sure you'll be provided the files for\n\n42\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.583\nyou to follow along.\n\n43\n00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:13.900\nSo it's kind of all over the place so\nI want to try and\n\n44\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.770\nkeep it concise but kind of jump\naround probably a little bit too.\n\n45\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.370\nSo the pen tool is, well it looks like the\npen tool and so you have it right in here.\n\n46\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.440\nAnd it's in this group of tools,\nso you've got the regular pen.\n\n47\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.840\nI actually, in my notes the pen\nis upside down, other way around.\n\n48\n00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.430\n>> Oops, you're getting the wrong way.\n\n49\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.890\n>> Okay, we'll just reorient ourself.\n\n50\n00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.405\nIt'll be fine.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:35.060\n>> [LAUGH] So we've got.\n\n52\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.690\nWait, that's why.\n\n53\n00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.810\nSee, look at my mouse cursor icon.\n\n54\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.784\nThat's why I did it.\n\n55\n00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:39.540\n>> There you go.\n\n56\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.095\n>> I knew I had a reason why.\n\n57\n00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:47.020\n[LAUGH] Wow anyway so back to\nthe tools for here and you can see it\n\n58\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.260\nis in this group where you have\nthe regular pen tool with a hot key of P.\n\n59\n00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.080\nAnd then you have your add anchor points,\ndelete anchor point,\n\n60\n00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.030\nand the convert tool, which I don't know\nwhy that's saying anchor point tool but\n\n61\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.580\nit's always the convert tool,\nthat's how I know it.\n\n62\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.530\nSo I've made a little cheat sheet here for\nyou to follow along,\n\n63\n00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.830\nto understand about the mouse cursor icon,\nso that's probably one of the most\n\n64\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.360\nimportant things to know about when\nworking with the pen tool modifying paths\n\n65\n00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.630\nwith the ads attracting to convert like,\nwhat is it doing?\n\n66\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.290\n>> Yeah, and you've told us several times\nthat paying attention to your cursor\n\n67\n00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.350\nis an important part of being successful\nat this, because that's how you know what\n\n68\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.680\nit's gonna do when you clear it or\nwhen you let go.\n\n69\n00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.200\n>> Exactly.\nYes, so making sure you watch it,\n\n70\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.330\nlike he said, I'm repeating it,\nI'm like a parrot, I'm a parrot pen tool.\n\n71\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.840\nOkay, so if you have the pen\nwith the star looking thing.\n\n72\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.870\nOr, it used to be,\nin older programs, it was an x.\n\n73\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.470\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, that was the,\n\n74\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.750\nyou're starting a new path.\n\n75\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.500\nAnd, all of these other icons, of like\nthere's no pen, or sorry, there's nothing\n\n76\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.260\non the pen icon, then it means continuing\nthe path, to close the anchor point.\n\n77\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.230\nYou can see through my notes of\nadd is pretty self explanatory.\n\n78\n00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.310\nIt means add, subtract, and\nthis little carrot thing.\n\n79\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.665\nI think it's probably best to demonstrate\nwhat I say by pick up and convert.\n\n80\n00:04:02.665 --> 00:04:03.540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n81\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.130\n>> But we'll, we'll get along to that and\n\n82\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.600\nthen the actual convert\ntool is just this carrot.\n\n83\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.090\nSo all the different things\nthat you will see in your mouse\n\n84\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.490\ncursor icons once we actual start\ngetting into using the pen tool itself.\n\n85\n00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.550\nAnd we've gone over this part before\nin some of our other episodes\n\n86\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.730\nthat we have the black arrow, well that's\nalways for the main selection tool.\n\n87\n00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.270\nThe, I want this thing to go\nback to black arrow tool.\n\n88\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.470\nAnd then the white arrow tool always for\nthe parts of the item you are selecting,\n\n89\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.910\nand more specifically we have selecting\nthe points and or the segments.\n\n90\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.080\nSo that's like whole and parts.\n\n91\n00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.920\nSo that one,\nwe've pretty much already gone over too.\n\n92\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.390\nThese are things that we can go\nover once we start getting into it.\n\n93\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.210\nBut there are just some different things\nto always keep in mind when using the pen\n\n94\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.640\ntool and some toggles that you can go to,\nlike the alt/option to go to convert.\n\n95\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.690\nI'm sure that doesn't mean anything to\nyou right now, cuz we haven't done it.\n\n96\n00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.490\nBut I'm just trying to at least\nprep you for the different things.\n\n97\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.160\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then the ctrl/cmd to toggle to\n\n98\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.400\nthe black arrow,\n[INAUDIBLE] you can all see this.\n\n99\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.270\nThis is something that I wanted to point\nout right now, since it's on this slide,\n\n100\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.888\nif we'll call it.\n\n101\n00:05:14.888 --> 00:05:17.478\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n102\n00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:21.020\n>> Is that in the pen tool in your\nnewer versions of Illustrator and\n\n103\n00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.030\nespecially in Illustrator CC,\nthere is a preference that you can\n\n104\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.230\nturn on which is called the rubber\nband and it's in the preferences under\n\n105\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.510\nthe section anchor display and I wanted\nto show you where that is right now.\n\n106\n00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.380\nAnd I always do that, let's go to.\n\n107\n00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.340\n>> So here and they will rubber band\ntool for pen tool or the curvature tool.\n\n108\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.480\nI have it unchecked right\nnow because I'm trying to.\n\n109\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.720\nWhat I always teach is kind of\nshow it in the old school way but\n\n110\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.820\nI want to turn it back on once we get\na little bit further down the line so\n\n111\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.200\nyou can see the difference.\n\n112\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.470\nIt's it's very helpful I really\ndo think it's helpful for\n\n113\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.780\nme it's almost distracting.\n\n114\n00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.856\n>> C uz its not what youre used to.\n\n115\n00:06:04.856 --> 00:06:05.570\nYeah.\nBut if you're\n\n116\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.970\nnew to this its something you definitely\nwant to try to use because its very handy.\n\n117\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.000\n>> I can kind of give you a little guide,\nand show you where the path is going\n\n118\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.060\nwhen youre doing these\n>> So just want to point out that to\n\n119\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.250\nyou guys right now okay, and\nthe other thing that's on this slide\n\n120\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.450\nis this wonderful I did this nice fancy\nfont right as Bezier Curves right.\n\n121\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.270\n>> Very curvy appropriate.\n\n122\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.280\n>> But it is yes, it's very curvy fun.\n\n123\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.053\nSo Bezier curves is.\n\n124\n00:06:33.053 --> 00:06:37.070\n>> That's actually what we're doing here,\nwhen we're creating something\n\n125\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.300\nlike this over here right, this little\nhoopy this or this S thing right,\n\n126\n00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.680\nthat is a Bezier curve, and\nI actually have some little\n\n127\n00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.790\nnotes that I wanted to read from because\n>> It was created by a French\n\n128\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.440\nengineer named Pierre Bezier in 1962.\n\n129\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.720\nAnd he worked for\nthe automobile company called Renault.\n\n130\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.460\nIs that how I pronounce it?\n\n131\n00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.090\nYeah, it's French, right?\n\n132\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.320\nOui, si, si, wait, wrong language.\n\n133\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:12.920\nAnyways, he was in charge of creating the\nauto body designs for the different cars.\n\n134\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.820\nAnd He was the one who\nwas using these curves.\n\n135\n00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.780\nYou think about a car, its got all\nthese curved edges and its super fancy.\n\n136\n00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.071\n>> Right, not those like,\nboxy little things.\n\n137\n00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:25.370\nMm-hm.\nHe actually was the one who started using\n\n138\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.560\nit and he was the one that actually\npopularized this Bezier curve.\n\n139\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.740\nAnd it was popularized, and\nthat is actually what is used, and\n\n140\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.490\nit has been adopted it is a standard\ncurve in the postscript language, and\n\n141\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.450\nsubsequently was adopted by vector\nprograms like Adobe Illustrator.\n\n142\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:45.750\n>> Yea you see them everywhere, or\nlike you said, in a lot of programs.\n\n143\n00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.480\nAnd it's because it's a curve based\non a mathematical formula, right?\n\n144\n00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.410\n>> Yeah, remember all that fun stuff in,\nwas it trigonometry?\n\n145\n00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.100\n>> Yes, plotting those curves.\n\n146\n00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.590\n>> Yeah, all those curves, yeah, and\nthe lines, and this, and the sines and\n\n147\n00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.170\nthe tangents and something like that.\n\n148\n00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.000\n>> Unfortunately.\n\n149\n00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.763\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You can see how much I\n\n150\n00:07:59.763 --> 00:08:01.823\nremember, that was a long time ago.\n\n151\n00:08:01.823 --> 00:08:03.286\nBut it is a All of this is math.\n\n152\n00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:07.376\nWe're dealing with math, and\ncurves are part of math.\n\n153\n00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:10.270\nAnd so\nthat's where it kind of came around.\n\n154\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.448\nBut he, French, [FOREIGN],\nwho are we talking about?\n\n155\n00:08:14.448 --> 00:08:17.880\nPierre, Pierre Bezie was\nthe one who popularized it,\n\n156\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.230\nbut it was actually first developed\nin 1959 by Paul de Casteljau, and\n\n157\n00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.360\nI'm doing a really bad job\nof pronouncing his name.\n\n158\n00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.335\nYou can look up the Wikipedia article\nas well and see how we can do that.\n\n159\n00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:31.095\nBut it is talking about the algorithm,\n\n160\n00:08:31.095 --> 00:08:34.385\nan a-numerically stable method\nto evaluate busy curves and\n\n161\n00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:38.755\nthe computer curves are widely using\ncomputer graphics to model smooth curves.\n\n162\n00:08:38.755 --> 00:08:41.872\nAnyways, these are the people\nIt's all about math.\n\n163\n00:08:41.872 --> 00:08:44.652\nLook it up.\nThere's all sorts of crazy numbers.\n\n164\n00:08:44.652 --> 00:08:47.622\nE's over N's and C's and\nstuff that I don't understand.\n\n165\n00:08:47.622 --> 00:08:50.192\n>> It's very important in just about\neverything we do in computers from video\n\n166\n00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:53.510\ngame design to what we're doing here,\nso definitely important.\n\n167\n00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.310\nYes.\n>> Not so\n\n168\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.945\nmuch that we understand the algorithms or\nanything like that, right?\n\n169\n00:08:56.945 --> 00:08:58.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we just have to know\n\n170\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.510\nthat's what we're creating.\n\n171\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.250\n>> Yeah, because we're gonna\ncreate things like squares and\n\n172\n00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.970\nshapes, and I don't know, I've got\na little guy over here back on my notes.\n\n173\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.680\nI don't, what are we, is that a dog?\n\n174\n00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.720\n>> I was thinking that might've been\na dinosaur from the French cave paintings.\n\n175\n00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.080\nHo ho, there you go\n>> Just like we have Bezie.\n\n176\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.790\nwe'll stick with the French theme.\n\n177\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.430\n>> Okay so we'll name him Bezzie?\n\n178\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.940\n>> There we go.\n\n179\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.080\n>> Bezzie the?\n\n180\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.900\n>> Bezzie the Brontosaurus\n>> There we go.\n\n181\n00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.910\nBezzie the Brontosaurus.\n\n182\n00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.272\nWe can use the pen tool to create Bezzie\n>> All right\n\n183\n00:09:30.272 --> 00:09:30.973\n>> Right here,\n\n184\n00:09:30.973 --> 00:09:33.076\nso I'm just giving you some examples,\n\n185\n00:09:33.076 --> 00:09:37.660\nwe've again probably gone over a lot of\nthis with this rectangle tool, right?\n\n186\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.750\nWell, the rectangle tool is really what?\n\n187\n00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.530\nIt's one, two, three, four.\n\n188\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:48.390\nThere are four points along this path,\nand it is a closed path.\n\n189\n00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.730\nAnd, if we have a triangle,\nthen that's just three points.\n\n190\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.440\nAnd I think you get the idea here, is that\nthese are all points along these closed\n\n191\n00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.620\npaths, and\nthey have straight segments in between.\n\n192\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.960\nSo, what's the different between\nthe square and the circle?\n\n193\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.180\nWell, in us it's like,\nwell it's a totally different shape.\n\n194\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.190\nBut really it still has one,\ntwo, three, four.\n\n195\n00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.690\nIt has four points, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.565\nIt's just that in-between those points,\nthe segments are not straight.\n\n197\n00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:17.895\nThey are curved, and there's that bezie.\n\n198\n00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:23.285\nAnd the way that this works is that\nthis is the actual point, but when we\n\n199\n00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:27.345\nget in the pen tool, I'll demonstrate as\nsoon as I get off this little red stuff,\n\n200\n00:10:27.345 --> 00:10:33.749\nis that it actually has handles, these\ncontrol handles, that control how the path\n\n201\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:40.730\nbends when it exits the point [CROSSTALK],\nand how it travels into the next point.\n\n202\n00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.691\nSo, it's all about the directions of\ntravel, you're leaving going one way,\n\n203\n00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:49.245\nyou're coming in to the point and\ngoing another way, and\n\n204\n00:10:49.245 --> 00:10:51.261\nthat's how you get these path.\n\n205\n00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:53.942\nAnd let me just show you that I've\nswitched back to the white arrow\n\n206\n00:10:53.942 --> 00:10:54.840\ntool on this.\n\n207\n00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.210\nSo, I'm using this to be able\nto select points on the paths.\n\n208\n00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.700\nYou can see right here that\nwhen I selected one point,\n\n209\n00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.940\nso there's the anchor point,\nI can move the point itself, right?\n\n210\n00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.540\nBut then you have these little guys,\nthese handles,\n\n211\n00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.350\nI call them seesaws, because they're,\nwell it looks like a seesaw.\n\n212\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.780\nAnd if I take the handle of the seesaw and\nmove it this way,\n\n213\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:24.830\nyou can see that I'm actually changing the\ncurve between this point and this point.\n\n214\n00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.720\nSo, I can change, and I can grab it see?\n\n215\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.990\nAnd this maybe kinda shows it here, you\nsee it's going out this way, right, and\n\n216\n00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.510\nthen kind of coming back through this way.\n\n217\n00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.570\nSo, it has to kind of come out a little\nbit and then come around the track.\n\n218\n00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.915\nIt's kind of like a racecar.\n\n219\n00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:42.230\n>> Because the points don't change\nwhen you're moving those handles.\n\n220\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.270\nIn the end result, the line still\nhas to make it back to that point.\n\n221\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.120\nYou're just changing\nits path to get there.\n\n222\n00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.960\n>> Yeah, and sometimes it might\nextend it because if I take this,\n\n223\n00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.190\nbecause there's also the proximity of\nthe end handle to be originated in point.\n\n224\n00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.270\n>> And the length of that bar there.\n\n225\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.820\n>> If I extend, and\nif I take the handle and\n\n226\n00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.260\nextend further at out from\nthe point you see has,\n\n227\n00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.660\nthis is it's trajectory if you wanna say,\nhere's how far you've gotta go out.\n\n228\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.010\nBut you also have to come\nback around here, and\n\n229\n00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.290\nso you've gotta go out a little bit\nfurther and then come back around.\n\n230\n00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.870\n>> Right.\n\n231\n00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.510\n>> If I take this and make it closer to\nthe originating point, see it doesn't have\n\n232\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:29.160\nas much travel, and so it just kind of\ngoes along to that next destination.\n\n233\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.100\nAnd so this is all the pen tool,\nwell its not necessarily the pen tool,\n\n234\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.700\nbut its path, and\nhow you can modify the points, and\n\n235\n00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.110\nthe handles that\nare created by the pen too.\n\n236\n00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.720\nThat is how I should probably say, this\nparticular example we're doing right now.\n\n237\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.360\nSo, you can see something like this Bezzy\nthe Brontosaurus, you could see that\n\n238\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.950\nI've got these different points along the\nway, and each one of them has different\n\n239\n00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.760\ndegrees of curvatureness, if that's\na word, that you see it goes out.\n\n240\n00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.770\nBut then it has to come in here and\ncome like that.\n\n241\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.700\nAnd that's why you get that what looks\nlike his little mouth, his little face,\n\n242\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.000\nhis little nose.\n\n243\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.400\nAnd see I can change it and\nmake it like so.\n\n244\n00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.460\nSo, Bezzy the Brontosaurus is created.\n\n245\n00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.170\nI actually created this\nwith the pen tool and\n\n246\n00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.730\ndifferent ways that I can move him around.\n\n247\n00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.710\nSo, that's the curved points.\n\n248\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:32.750\nNow, I've put this in the next part of my\nnotes, because we can get to where you can\n\n249\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.820\nmake straight points to curves and\ncurves to straights.\n\n250\n00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.120\nThat's the whole going back to the\nconvert, because what is the difference\n\n251\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.900\nbetween this shape and this shape,\nit's still four points.\n\n252\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.000\n>> Yeah, the points with the straight\npaths don't have the little see-saws or\n\n253\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.470\nthe busy A-handles.\n\n254\n00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.050\nIt's right here, so\nyou can see that this is still, oop,\n\n255\n00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.280\nI changed the wrong color, sorry.\n\n256\n00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.530\nI went back to the brush tool, which we\nhaven't covered yet, but it will be later.\n\n257\n00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.310\nSo we've got here,\nthe same thing, same here.\n\n258\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.680\nI think I might have moved them around,\nand the same idea here.\n\n259\n00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.235\nThe points in the circle are here, and\nthe points on the diamond are here.\n\n260\n00:14:10.235 --> 00:14:12.972\nWe've just made them\nfrom curved to straight.\n\n261\n00:14:12.972 --> 00:14:17.565\nAnd that really does go back to,\nlook at all these,\n\n262\n00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:21.020\ngoes back to using this\nconvert tool to be able to say\n\n263\n00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.050\nmake a straight into a curve or\nmake a curve into a straight.\n\n264\n00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.220\n>> Well that makes perfect sense.\n\n265\n00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:26.900\n>> It does.\n\n266\n00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.430\nAnd then I just got\na couple of more examples\n\n267\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.770\nover here about we have open paths.\n\n268\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.730\nOkay, all concepts that we've talked\nabout, closed and open paths.\n\n269\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.600\nSo here, of course, it's just gonna\nbe point, point, point, point,\n\n270\n00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.450\nso straight and then curves here.\n\n271\n00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.300\nThis is just two points.\n\n272\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.210\nOkay?\n\n273\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.520\n>> You might, you could, okay?\n\n274\n00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.870\nYou could put a point here, but\n\n275\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.300\nin this particular example,\nit's only one, and one.\n\n276\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.450\nIt's only two points, so\nsame idea straight versus curved.\n\n277\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:01.300\nThis guy really demonstrates the,\nit goes, it leaves this first point.\n\n278\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.210\nSo, this is point number one.\n\n279\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.960\nThis is point number two.\n\n280\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.670\nThis is point number three.\n\n281\n00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.110\nAlright?\nIt leaves this point going up,\n\n282\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:12.010\nand it comes into this\npoint going down and\n\n283\n00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.190\nthat’s for you go up, and then you’re\ngo down and it makes the curve.\n\n284\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.720\nNow keeps on going because from\npoint two to three, it goes down and\n\n285\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.500\nit then goes back up.\n\n286\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:27.890\nIt keeps continuing along its trajectory,\nyeah, we'll go with that.\n\n287\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.760\nThe direction of which you're moving.\n\n288\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.020\nYou're going up and\nyou're up and you're down and\n\n289\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.790\neverything's just kind of the same\nas back on good old Bezzie.\n\n290\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.550\nHe was the same way too.\n\n291\n00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.170\nWe just kept on kind of moving around and\ngoing which way.\n\n292\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.830\nThere wasn't any corner points, so that's\nthe next thing I want to talk about.\n\n293\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.610\nBecause look at this one is different,\nit's one two, three, four.\n\n294\n00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.825\nA little off in that third one, right?\n\n295\n00:15:51.825 --> 00:15:55.137\n>> [LAUGH] Well, now this one,\nI see the line comes in, but\n\n296\n00:15:55.137 --> 00:15:57.519\nit doesn't go back out the other side.\n\n297\n00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:00.609\nSo we have point one,\ntwo, three, four, okay?\n\n298\n00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:04.228\nAnd in this one,\nit leaves point one going up And\n\n299\n00:16:04.228 --> 00:16:09.130\ncomes into point two coming down,\njust like the other example.\n\n300\n00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:14.309\nBut then in the same point\nin same point number\n\n301\n00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:19.910\ntwo it turns around and\nthen it goes out this way.\n\n302\n00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.270\nSo it comes in one way and\n\n303\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.850\ntravels out a separate way it’s like\ngoing into the corner of the room, right.\n\n304\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.350\nYou can a go in and\nthe only way to go out is the other way,\n\n305\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.730\nthat's what they call a corner point.\n\n306\n00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:38.510\nSo then the same thing here from\ntwo to three it goes up comes in\n\n307\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.310\ndown and then turns around and\nI'm running out of colors.\n\n308\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.753\nAnd then goes back out and\nso on and so forth.\n\n309\n00:16:45.753 --> 00:16:52.880\nSo changing the directory\nof a point is something\n\n310\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:58.380\nthat kind of going back over here,\nis where you can\n\n311\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.750\ntoggle to what's known as the convert\npoint, because i have to convert it.\n\n312\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:08.370\nt's not just, let me backup on that one\nbecause when I say convert, we just said,\n\n313\n00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:13.673\nstraight to curve well in that seesaw\nthere was two handles, weren't they?\n\n314\n00:17:13.673 --> 00:17:18.092\nSo it's not just going straight to\ncurve it's actually breaking the seesaw\n\n315\n00:17:18.092 --> 00:17:20.684\nto where one handle-\n>> Can move independently than\n\n316\n00:17:20.684 --> 00:17:21.414\nthe other one.\n\n317\n00:17:21.414 --> 00:17:26.383\n>> Yes, move independently than this one\nso that's another reason why you want\n\n318\n00:17:26.383 --> 00:17:30.511\nto use that convert Anchor point tool or\nwhile you're drawing,\n\n319\n00:17:30.511 --> 00:17:34.420\nyou toggle to that tool,\ncuz then you can say do it like this.\n\n320\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.812\nNot just like this,\nlike that [CROSSTALK] kind of.\n\n321\n00:17:37.812 --> 00:17:39.685\nLike my little demonstrations?\n\n322\n00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:43.670\n[LAUGH] So, so that's the idea about\na corner point and so we're gonna do, and\n\n323\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.330\nI'm gonna show you how to, how I\nactually made all of these paths, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:46.870\nOkay.\nBut\n\n325\n00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.490\nI like to be able to explain the concepts\nbehind it cause it makes it,\n\n326\n00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.270\nI think makes a little bit more sense.\n\n327\n00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.130\n>> I agree.\n\n328\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:59.470\n>> Okay and then we have ways\nthat we can modify a shape and\n\n329\n00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.540\nI maybe kind of did this in the shapes\nwhere we actually just move the points,\n\n330\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.510\nlike we move that one point here.\n\n331\n00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.140\nAnd we just say okay.\n\n332\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.310\nWe'll just move it in like that.\n\n333\n00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.810\nWe made a triangle.\n\n334\n00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.170\nSo this is still four points.\n\n335\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.830\nBut you could just take this guy.\n\n336\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.290\nAnd you could just minus that one point.\n\n337\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.880\nAnd if I subtract this\npoint now I have three.\n\n338\n00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.430\nI have this, or the same thing over here.\n\n339\n00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:28.020\nIf I wanted to take this little guy and\nmake it like this.\n\n340\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.770\nWell I could just add a point.\n\n341\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.340\nI forgot I made these cute little brushes.\n\n342\n00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.595\nSo I can add a point here.\n\n343\n00:18:32.595 --> 00:18:34.470\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, and then take this point,\n\n344\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.300\nand then just move it up.\n\n345\n00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:36.800\n>> Mm.\n\n346\n00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.130\n>> And then I could add another point\nhere, and then just move that down.\n\n347\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.650\nSo it's taking one tool to add or\nsubtract,\n\n348\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.340\nand then going back to\nthat white arrow tool,\n\n349\n00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.750\nbecause that's the one that you can\nuse to actually select your points.\n\n350\n00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.470\nAnd then moving them around.\n\n351\n00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:55.670\nAnd then the same idea here would be,\nI can take this straight point,\n\n352\n00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.020\nand I can convert it into\na roundy point or a curvy point.\n\n353\n00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.730\nSo, actually, there we go,\nthere's the handle.\n\n354\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.740\nSo there's the see-saw, straight to curve.\n\n355\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.390\nAnd then let me kind of go back over here.\n\n356\n00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.755\nThese guys I've done it on\nthe wrong layer, whoops.\n\n357\n00:19:11.755 --> 00:19:15.040\nOkay.\n[LAUGH] You can see that this one might\n\n358\n00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.970\nbe, this one's okay.\n\n359\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.120\nThis ones not the best example,\nlet me here.\n\n360\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.580\nSorry let me move this over for you guys.\n\n361\n00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.110\nWhoops, what did I do wrong?\n\n362\n00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.950\nWhy can't I move this\nwhole path right now?\n\n363\n00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.660\n>> Do you have the, you have the white\narrow and not the black arrow.\n\n364\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.180\n>> Good job.\n\n365\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.750\nSee, I did that on purpose so\nI could quiz you,\n\n366\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.361\nto see if you're paying attention there,\nMike.\n\n367\n00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:35.718\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So you can see that over here,\n\n368\n00:19:35.718 --> 00:19:41.020\nthat if I go back to this, you see\nthere's the leave comes in this way.\n\n369\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.780\nIt's kinda weird to see\nbecause it comes in this way.\n\n370\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.830\nAnd then it goes that way.\n\n371\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.960\nSo you see that the seesaw is broken.\n\n372\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.050\nThis moves different than this.\n\n373\n00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.170\n>> Independent.\n\n374\n00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.260\n>> Exactly,\nwhich is different than this guy moving.\n\n375\n00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.130\nIf I move one it moves the other.\n\n376\n00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:57.770\n>> Very cool.\n\n377\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.650\n>> With all of my demonstration\nstuff on top of it, so.\n\n378\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:06.310\nSo, that's where we got\nwith the pen tool and\n\n379\n00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.910\nhow we explain all the different tools.\n\n380\n00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.360\nSo, I think now what\nwe'd like to do is show\n\n381\n00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.100\nyou how to actually make\nthat with the pen tool and\n\n382\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.560\ngo along with it but maybe we\nshould save that for our part two.\n\n383\n00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.480\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n384\n00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.450\nI think we'll do that.\n\n385\n00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:22.380\nSo, we will come back in a part two and\nactually put all of these great tips and\n\n386\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.800\ntechniques that Von has been teaching\nus to use, using her pen tool and\n\n387\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.570\nplay around with some busy a curves.\n\n388\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.870\nSo, hope everybody enjoyed\nwatching this one.\n\n389\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.440\nSigning off for IT Pro TV.\n\n390\n00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.336\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n391\n00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:33.055\n>> I'm Von

00:00:17.476\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:20.977\ntoday we're going to do\nan Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.977 --> 00:00:22.829\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.111\nwe're actually continuing our\nthought process on pen tools.\n\n7\n00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:27.670\nSo that means we had a part one.\n\n8\n00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.400\nIf you haven't seen that yet,\nmake sure you go back and\n\n9\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.690\nwatch it, where we talked about a lot of\nthe things we could do with the pen tool.\n\n10\n00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.380\nSome of the foundational knowledge about\nthe pen tool that we need to have.\n\n11\n00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.310\nNow we're ready to actually use\nthe pen tool in Illustrator.\n\n12\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.300\nAnd here for\nus with me is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n13\n00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.090\nHow's it going Vonne?\n\n14\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.210\n>> Good, ready to continue on\nwith our path on the pen tool.\n\n15\n00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.040\n>> All right.\n\n16\n00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.730\n>> This is our part two as he was saying.\n\n17\n00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.770\nShould we say part deux?\n\n18\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.915\n>> To stick with our French theme\nI think we probably should.\n\n19\n00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:56.774\n>> Oui, oui.\n\n20\n00:00:56.774 --> 00:00:59.664\n>> With our bezier curves and our-\n>> Yes.\n\n21\n00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:00.462\n>> Little french dinosaur.\n\n22\n00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:04.854\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly, so we're gonna\nactually use this episode to show you how\n\n23\n00:01:04.854 --> 00:01:07.950\nto create our little Bessie\nthe Brontosaurus, and\n\n24\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.720\nall of our different paths.\n\n25\n00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.778\nSo first episode was more theory,\nwe could say, and\n\n26\n00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:15.567\nnow we're going to actually\nget into doing it.\n\n27\n00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:20.176\nSo let's get started, so\nsame file that we started with,\n\n28\n00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:24.138\nI cleaned off all of my notations and\neverything.\n\n29\n00:01:24.138 --> 00:01:28.482\nJust to give you a little background,\nI am using the demo layer.\n\n30\n00:01:28.482 --> 00:01:31.287\nYou can see that right now I have,\nwhy did I zoom in on this?\n\n31\n00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:34.192\n[LAUGH] Well, I've got the demo layer and\nthe content layer.\n\n32\n00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:36.561\nEverything that I have\non here is the content,\n\n33\n00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:40.778\nand the demo has some different little\nnotes and everything that I'm going to do.\n\n34\n00:01:40.778 --> 00:01:45.936\nThe other thing I'm going to turn off for\nnow is the Smart Guides\n\n35\n00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:50.718\nbecause all the pinks are gonna\nbe going on all over stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:53.565\nAnd when we were kind of going over\nit while we are prepping this it\n\n37\n00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:56.360\nwas little distracting, so\nI'm just gonna turn them off, but\n\n38\n00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.800\nI wanted to show you guys\nthat's what I'm actually doing.\n\n39\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.098\nAnd let me just check one more thing\nbecause I think I already turned it on,\n\n40\n00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:04.460\nyep I did.\n\n41\n00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.270\nAnd also before we turned this\nepisode on I wanted to turn on\n\n42\n00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.170\nthe rubber band option\nthat I mentioned before,\n\n43\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.015\nI'm gonna turn it off for now so\nI can show you the difference.\n\n44\n00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:20.010\nOkay, so, we've got right here\nall of our different icons of our\n\n45\n00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.090\nmouse cursor that we need to pay attention\nto and the black and white arrow.\n\n46\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.200\nNow this square right here or the\nrectangle whatever you want to call it,\n\n47\n00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.340\nwe could use the rectangle tool\nvery easily, and that's fine but\n\n48\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.410\nwe're using the pen tool.\n\n49\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.976\nSo we're gonna use the pen tool and\n\n50\n00:02:32.976 --> 00:02:36.173\nright now my mouse cursor icon looks\nlike a star means it's a new path.\n\n51\n00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:40.461\nSo if I'm making straight paths,\nstraight points, straight closed, open,\n\n52\n00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:44.040\ndoesn't matter, it's just click,\nclick, click, click.\n\n53\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.710\nJust like I was kind of demonstrating with\nthe there's a point here, point here,\n\n54\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.640\npoint here, point here.\n\n55\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.690\n>> Okay.\n>> Just click.\n\n56\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.570\nSo I click once and then I move over.\n\n57\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.700\nYou can see that now the circle, or\nactually there's nothing there on the pen.\n\n58\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.790\n>> It's gone, right.\n\n59\n00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.040\n>> Yes, so\nthat means that it is continuing on\n\n60\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.790\nwith this path that I'm going on.\n\n61\n00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.745\nSo if I click one more time, and\nthen that's not really straight, is it?\n\n62\n00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:05.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n63\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.460\nif I wanted to make it straight,\nyou would hold the Shift key, okay.\n\n64\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.420\nJust like I constraining proportions and\nanything we do.\n\n65\n00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.860\nIf I hold the Shift and then click,\n\n66\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.935\nnow it actually made a straight\npoint from point two to point three.\n\n67\n00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:16.490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n68\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.640\n>> I hold the shift key one\nmore time coming on over.\n\n69\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.520\nAnd then, to complete this,\nyou just move right back up.\n\n70\n00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.110\nAnd you see how I'm hovering over\nthe first point that I started with,\n\n71\n00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.680\nand it gives me that little\ncircle at the bottom of the pen.\n\n72\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.850\nWhich means that yes, I found the first,\nI'm going to now close the path, and\n\n73\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.920\nif I click it, and move off, you can see\nthat I'm back to the pen with the star,\n\n74\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.050\nwhich means that I am\nready to make a new path.\n\n75\n00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.049\n>> Very cool.\n>> So, that's how that was created.\n\n76\n00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.859\nOkay, I wanted to make the triangle,\nyou could just click, click, click, click.\n\n77\n00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.490\nAgain it's not very straight but\nyou get the idea.\n\n78\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.364\nSame thing here as that I can just click,\nclick, click, click,\n\n79\n00:03:55.364 --> 00:04:00.780\nclick, obviously not using any type of\ngrid and just kinda free flowing around,\n\n80\n00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.350\nbut I could at least show you\nthat that's how you make it.\n\n81\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.270\nJust keep on clicking, watch for\nyour cursors and so on and so forth.\n\n82\n00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.110\nOne thing that I am going\nto do before we move,\n\n83\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.970\nI'm gonna make this stroke a little\nbit thicker so you can see,\n\n84\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.800\nthat's the wrong arrow, I'm gonna make\nthat a little thicker so you can see it.\n\n85\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.250\nI'm also gonna take the fill off,\n\n86\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.130\nthis is something I probably\nshould have done to begin with.\n\n87\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.480\nNow, why would I do that?\n\n88\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.780\nBecause if I was going to do this over,\n\n89\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.035\nlet me show you that if I\nwas going to use this pen.\n\n90\n00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:30.946\nWhoops, sorry, hold on, there we go.\n\n91\n00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:34.460\nBack to the pen with the white\nfill like it was before.\n\n92\n00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.010\nIf I was trying to show you how to do some\nof this, if I click, you can see that if I\n\n93\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.040\nstart moving over, it's gonna create\na fill that I couldn't show on top of it.\n\n94\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.940\nSo I wanted to take that fill off for\n\n95\n00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.420\nwhen I'm trying to make maybe\nrecreate our friend Bessie over here.\n\n96\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.960\nIt's gonna look all weird if I have a fill\n\n97\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.520\nthat is being created while\nI make these paths, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.940\nSo just kind of throwing that out there.\n\n99\n00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.910\nAnd I can change the color as I go\nalong and everything like that.\n\n100\n00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.840\nOkay, so\nnow I want to hold off on this one.\n\n101\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.620\nI want to hold off on\nthe closed circle path and\n\n102\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.100\nour bezi guy because I want\nto go over to our open path.\n\n103\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.668\nI think I think it's easier to demonstrate\nthe idea about using the curves\n\n104\n00:05:21.668 --> 00:05:26.025\nwith pen on open path first before\ngoing back on the close, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.555\nSo I think you guys can get the idea here\n\n106\n00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:30.695\nwith the open straight\npath is gonna be what?\n\n107\n00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:31.975\nJust-\n>> Two clicks?\n\n108\n00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:34.215\n>> Yeah, click, click, click, go on over.\n\n109\n00:05:34.215 --> 00:05:36.649\nSo click, click, but\nthis is something I would like to,\n\n110\n00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:40.122\nhere let me undo let me Ctrl+Z and hold\nthat Shift key so at least it's straight.\n\n111\n00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:45.610\nOkay [LAUGH] this is where I have\nthe pen and I has the nothing on it.\n\n112\n00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.664\nAnd if there is nothing it means\nthat it's gonna continuing, so\n\n113\n00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:52.847\nthis is something everybody always kind of\ndoes when they first start, they're like,\n\n114\n00:05:52.847 --> 00:05:55.100\nokay I'm done, I know I'm done.\n\n115\n00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.120\nSo you go over here, and\nthen what's gonna happen?\n\n116\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.540\n>> Well you might think you're done,\nVaughn, but\n\n117\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.780\nI don't think Illustrator\nknows you're done.\n\n118\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.850\n>> You're correct, yeah.\n\n119\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.510\nSo we need to have Illustrator know\nthat I'm ready to make a new path.\n\n120\n00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.490\nCuz if I go right,\nit's just gonna keep on going, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.710\nSo now I can, of course, undo,\nright, Ctrl+Z, and go back, but\n\n122\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.150\nhow do I stop an open path,\nand move on to the new one?\n\n123\n00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.880\nOkay, now there's a couple\nof ways you could do this.\n\n124\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.990\nI'm just gonna tell you that I think\nthe easiest way is just hit the Enter or\n\n125\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.790\nthe Return key.\n\n126\n00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.460\nSo I have the pen with the nothing\nright now which means continue,\n\n127\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.390\nI hit Enter and\nthen move my mouse a little bit and\n\n128\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.840\nit goes back to-\n>> Yeah, that's kinda neat.\n\n129\n00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.320\nAnd that's kind of a, at least I\nthink it's a newer shortcut that\n\n130\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.525\nwasn't available, or\nmaybe it always was and I never knew it.\n\n131\n00:06:45.525 --> 00:06:48.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I was gonna show you the way that I\n\n132\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.050\nwas brought up,\nif you want to say, on this.\n\n133\n00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.730\nBut I just go click,\nclick, and I make my path.\n\n134\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:59.162\nI would hold my Ctrl or Cmd key,\nand any time you hold your Ctrl or\n\n135\n00:06:59.162 --> 00:07:03.700\nCmd in really almost any tool, it always\ntoggles back to the black arrow tool.\n\n136\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.463\nNow with the black arrow tool I would just\nclick off into nowhere, like deselect,\n\n137\n00:07:08.463 --> 00:07:12.348\nlet go of the Ctrl or Cmd key, and\nthen I'm back to the pen with the.\n\n138\n00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:15.510\nI keep wanting to say pen with an x\nbecause that's how I always used to teach\n\n139\n00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.442\nthis as pen with an x.\n\n140\n00:07:16.442 --> 00:07:19.065\nSo it's really hard for\nme to get back into the pen with a star.\n\n141\n00:07:19.065 --> 00:07:21.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the pen with the star.\n\n142\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.870\nSo the Enter is a really quick\nway to stop an open path.\n\n143\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.390\n>> Yes.\n\n144\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.320\n>> I think you can also, I think you\ncan go back and hit the pen tool.\n\n145\n00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.420\nNope.\nThere\n\n146\n00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.130\nwas another way you can do it\n>> Escape?\n\n147\n00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.218\n>> Is it Escape?\n\n148\n00:07:34.218 --> 00:07:35.495\nNo.\n\n149\n00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:41.820\nWell Delete's gonna delete a point so\nthat's not a very good point.\n\n150\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.380\nMaybe going on that part that I was\nkind of messing up a little bit.\n\n151\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.860\nIf I click click click and then,\nwhoops I wasn't supposed to do that right?\n\n152\n00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.380\nYou can hit the Delete or the Backspace\nkey and it's going to backspace over.\n\n153\n00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.750\nWell, it deleted all of them.\n\n154\n00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.100\nIt will go ahead and backspace\nover that last point that you did.\n\n155\n00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.925\nI don't know why it's doing all of them.\n\n156\n00:08:01.925 --> 00:08:03.039\nBut it usually should, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.713\nSo that's something to know.\n\n158\n00:08:05.713 --> 00:08:08.419\nOf course you can always undo,\nand then just keep on going, and\n\n159\n00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:09.880\ndo what you need to do that way.\n\n160\n00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.650\nSo I think you can get the consonant V's.\n\n161\n00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.082\n>> The consonant V's.\n\n162\n00:08:15.082 --> 00:08:17.010\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] The consonant.\n\n163\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.690\nIt's a old Internet strongbad.\n\n164\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:19.230\n>> Strongbad.\n\n165\n00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.625\n>> Strongbad, yeah.\n\n166\n00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.031\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Typing with the gloves.\n\n167\n00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:22.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n168\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.070\nif you don't know what I'm talking about,\njust Google it.\n\n169\n00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.645\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n170\n00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:27.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's old school too.\n\n171\n00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.680\nSo click, click, click and you can make\nthe consummate Bs with the Trogdor.\n\n172\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.735\nBurning down the thatch-roofed villages.\n\n173\n00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:35.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n174\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.470\nOnly some of you all are gonna get that.\n\n175\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.000\nOkay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.390\n>> It's still out there by the way.\n\n177\n00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:39.930\n>> It is.\n\n178\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.300\n>> I have looked recently and\nit's still out there.\n\n179\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.950\n>> Yes.\n>> Impressive stuff.\n\n180\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.640\nSo go look that up.\n\n181\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.520\n>> So yeah.\nIf you wanna know what Trogdor is.\n\n182\n00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.490\nWe'll see,\nit probably made him with the pen tool.\n\n183\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.720\n>> Probably.\n\n184\n00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.980\n>> All right, so now if we're going\non to our open paths with the curves.\n\n185\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.440\nBecause everything's been straight so far.\n\n186\n00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.220\nAnd I said I wanted to\ndemonstrate on this first.\n\n187\n00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.300\nSo here we go, we have two points, right?\n\n188\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.190\nSo this first one, it's not just a click.\n\n189\n00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:08.650\nYou have to click, hold and\ndirect where you want it to go.\n\n190\n00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.940\nOkay?\nSo, I'm gonna click hold,\n\n191\n00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.490\nholding my mouse down,\nand I'm gonna drag up.\n\n192\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.260\nOkay?\n\n193\n00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.870\nSo, I'm moving up, and I'm saying\nI want this path to start here and\n\n194\n00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.303\nleave going this way and then let go.\n\n195\n00:09:21.303 --> 00:09:22.573\nNow, this is not a path.\n\n196\n00:09:22.573 --> 00:09:27.550\nRight.\nThis is not a path, this is just a single\n\n197\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.230\npoint right now with\na Bezier directional handle\n\n198\n00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.655\nthat I I know that I started going up.\n\n199\n00:09:33.655 --> 00:09:35.080\nOkay.\n\n200\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.370\nSo then I come over here my\nother point click hold and\n\n201\n00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.630\ndrag down to see you that's where\nthat whole I'm pulling down but\n\n202\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.410\nit's actually pulling the car up and so\nI am directing the path through this\n\n203\n00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:53.060\npoint to come down, and\nthen I let go, and it makes that.\n\n204\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.700\n>> Very cool.\n>> And that's how you work with it.\n\n205\n00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.260\n>> So, really what you're doing there,\nlike that second one,\n\n206\n00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.470\nI can see where some people can\nget confused, you're drawing down,\n\n207\n00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.580\nand the curves going up.\n\n208\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.360\nBut, what you're really drawing is where\nis this path gonna go when it leaves\n\n209\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.620\nthis point that I've just drawn?\n\n210\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.325\n>> Yep, how it leaves, how it comes in.\n\n211\n00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:10.040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n212\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.950\n>> All about that.\n\n213\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.090\nSo I'm gonna go back to\nthe white arrow tool just to,\n\n214\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.900\nI just hit the A key for my hot key.\n\n215\n00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.540\nSo you can see that here's my point.\n\n216\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.560\nSee I can move this point, right?\n\n217\n00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.690\nAnd I can move this point,\nwhoops, let's start that again.\n\n218\n00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:29.040\nI'm gonna move this point and then I can\nalso change the direction of the handle.\n\n219\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.020\nI can take the handle and move this here.\n\n220\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.990\nAnd move this here.\n\n221\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.960\nSo you see how it kinda\ngoes out like that.\n\n222\n00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.140\nOr, if I wanted to maybe have\nit go straight up and down.\n\n223\n00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.000\nI would say like, Increase the amplitude\nof the curve if you wanna say.\n\n224\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.170\nIf I wanna make this curve even more,\n\n225\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:52.310\nthen you pull the handle further\naway from its originating point up.\n\n226\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.240\nBut why didn't I pull it down?\n\n227\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.040\nWell, you could, but\nit doesn't really do anything.\n\n228\n00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.550\nThis is almost like two\nhalves of the see-saw.\n\n229\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.770\nIt's like it's coming in, so\nthis handle, oops, hold on.\n\n230\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.830\nThis handle controls this part.\n\n231\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.450\n>> Coming in.\n\n232\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:15.100\n>> Yeah, and let me just demonstrate on\nhere before we start actually creating it.\n\n233\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.620\nSee this handle here for\nthis middle dot, right, so\n\n234\n00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.070\nit's a see-saw,\nI can go ahead and twirl it.\n\n235\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.460\nBut if I pull this one,\n\n236\n00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.530\nsee it's only affecting this part,\nnot this between point two and three.\n\n237\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.770\nIt's only controlling\nbetween points one and two.\n\n238\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.180\nThis bottom part of\nthe see saw handle thing,\n\n239\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.430\nthat's going to control how it is\nfrom point two to three, okay.\n\n240\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.910\nSo they are together yet\nseparate, they're independent but\n\n241\n00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:46.750\ndependent, all that kind of wonderful\nthings that I love to say, okay.\n\n242\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.470\nI'm just going to undo\nthat a couple of times.\n\n243\n00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.910\nSo, we can go back to\nwhere I'm at right here.\n\n244\n00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.910\nLet me zoom in.\n\n245\n00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.530\nAnd let's go back to the pen tool.\n\n246\n00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.000\nSo, my hot key is P.\n\n247\n00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.600\nSo with this one,\nthink we got the idea right?\n\n248\n00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.180\nClick hold, drag up.\n\n249\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.570\nDon't click, click drag.\n\n250\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:02.440\nThat's not what you do.\n\n251\n00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.890\nClick hold, drag, it's all one motion.\n\n252\n00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:09.840\nLet go, click, hold, drag,\ndesignate there, let go, click,\n\n253\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.890\nhold, drag, and there you go.\n\n254\n00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:17.150\nHit the enter, or you can toggle to the\nblack arrow too by holding the control.\n\n255\n00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.010\nClick off, let go, and\nyou're back to the pen with an X, okay?\n\n256\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:20.740\n>> Very neat.\n\n257\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.930\n>> I said pen with an X, didn't I?\n\n258\n00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.330\n>> You did.\n>> I meant to say star.\n\n259\n00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:23.940\nOkay, sorry.\n\n260\n00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.000\nStar, X, this kind of thing.\n\n261\n00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.780\nYou know, actually when I say that I\nshould tell you something really quickly.\n\n262\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.690\nIs when you have the pen tool,\nif you ever have your caps lock on,\n\n263\n00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.420\nif your caps lock is on,\nlook at what the mouse cursor looks like.\n\n264\n00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.858\n>> An X.\n>> It looks like an X.\n\n265\n00:12:39.858 --> 00:12:40.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n266\n00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.200\n>> Yeah so be careful about that.\n\n267\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.450\nAnd I can click and\nit's always gonna be an X.\n\n268\n00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.913\nAnd you see it kinda gives you that\nexact place of where that path is\n\n269\n00:12:48.913 --> 00:12:50.954\ngonna come out, [CROSSTALK].\n\n270\n00:12:50.954 --> 00:12:54.862\nYeah, they call it a precise cursor but\nI, it always serves me off so\n\n271\n00:12:54.862 --> 00:12:58.566\nthe caps lock and that's actually\nin a lot of different tools and\n\n272\n00:12:58.566 --> 00:13:01.350\nacross a multiple\napplications in the derby.\n\n273\n00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.460\nIt's the caps lock will give you, always\ngive you an X in a lot of your tools, so\n\n274\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.810\nkeep that in mind.\n\n275\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.280\nOkay, so\nnow we're on to the corner points, right?\n\n276\n00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.830\nOkay, now this one's fun.\n\n277\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.520\nAll right, one, two, three, four.\n\n278\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.570\nWe talked about all of these.\n\n279\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:16.440\nHow am I going to do this?\n\n280\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.580\nI'm going to move this up to the side so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n281\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.120\nSo, I'm going to start with my pen tool.\n\n282\n00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.490\nI'm going to click, hold, and\ndrag up because I know I want to go up.\n\n283\n00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.200\nNow, I'm going to click,\nhold, and drag down.\n\n284\n00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.030\nAnd then I'm gonna let go.\n\n285\n00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.375\nAnd I'm like, wait,\nI didn't complete this.\n\n286\n00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:32.270\nBecause where is it going?\n\n287\n00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.520\nIt's leaving point two going down.\n\n288\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.780\nSo if I started to try to do\nthis it's still gonna go down.\n\n289\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.600\nSo this is where if you already let go,\nyou're fine.\n\n290\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.350\nThis is where you can now Hold your ALT or\nyour Option key.\n\n291\n00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.510\nAnd you see how it automatically,\nsee if I let go, now there it is.\n\n292\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.590\nI'm holding my ALT key because\nbasically what this is going to say is\n\n293\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.470\nI want to convert.\n\n294\n00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.075\nRemember whole break the seesaw?\n\n295\n00:13:58.075 --> 00:13:59.510\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I want to break the seesaw,\n\n296\n00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.030\nI don't want it to travel\nout of point to going down,\n\n297\n00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.890\nI want it to leave going back up.\n\n298\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.390\nSo holding that ALT.\n\n299\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.430\nI grab just that handle,\nbroken the seesaw,\n\n300\n00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:14.280\nand now I want to say leave that way,\ngo up, and there you go.\n\n301\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.320\nLet go of the Alt, and so\nnow I can click, hold, drag down.\n\n302\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.810\nNow if you want, you can let go, okay?\n\n303\n00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.720\nSo I'm just gonna let go so you can see.\n\n304\n00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.940\nHold the alt, get the handle,\npull it back up.\n\n305\n00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.350\nLet go of the mouse first,\n\n306\n00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.230\nbefore you let go of the alt,\nbecause you want to stay in that toggle.\n\n307\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.540\nbut you could do it all in one motion.\n\n308\n00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.790\nYou can click hold and drag down.\n\n309\n00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.310\nI'm still holding the mouse\ncursor down hold the Alt and\n\n310\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.320\nthen you see how it just goes ahead and\nbreaks it down.\n\n311\n00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.960\nIt's kind of the same thing one way or the\nother it just depends on if you let go or\n\n312\n00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:47.610\nnot let go you're still going to toggle\nto the Alt key and then you go, like so.\n\n313\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.650\nYou hit enter to finish the path.\n\n314\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.600\nYou take your white arrow tool to start\nmoving your points around to where exactly\n\n315\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.110\nwhere you want.\n\n316\n00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.610\nBecause even if you don't get it right,\n\n317\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.470\nI will say, get the general direction,\nget it close.\n\n318\n00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.660\nCuz then you can come back and use all of\nthese to move all of these straight up and\n\n319\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.890\ndown and get it all perfect throw\nyour grids on, throw your snaps and\n\n320\n00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.250\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n321\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.232\nThis is that point where back in that\ngrid episode there I told you that these\n\n322\n00:15:11.232 --> 00:15:15.778\nBezier, or the handles, don't snap that to\nthe grid anymore which is not fun for me,\n\n323\n00:15:15.778 --> 00:15:19.040\nit's really bad and\nI don't know why they took that away.\n\n324\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.070\nAnyways, just throwing that in there.\n\n325\n00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.375\nNow this one kind of throws people.\n\n326\n00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:25.630\nOkay.\n\n327\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:30.150\nBecause If you see here, we've got it\ngoing up, we got it going down and\n\n328\n00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.190\nthen it just goes straight, right?\n\n329\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.860\nMm-hm.\nAnd then from here it's straight but\n\n330\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.990\nthen it goes up and that's that.\n\n331\n00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.260\nLet me go up to that brush.\n\n332\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:44.940\nSo one, two, three, four,\nwow those are kind of a fat brushes there.\n\n333\n00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.210\nBut that a two.\n\n334\n00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.170\nOkay.\n\n335\n00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.900\nSo between two and\nthree it's straight right?\n\n336\n00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.891\nBetween three and four is not straight.\n\n337\n00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:57.219\nSo it's all about using that Alt key so\n\n338\n00:15:57.219 --> 00:16:01.670\nlet me go back to pen and\nlets kind of move it over.\n\n339\n00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:09.064\nSo I'm going to click and drag up Let go,\nclick on drag down get that first part.\n\n340\n00:16:09.064 --> 00:16:10.460\nOkay?\n\n341\n00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.890\nNow hold ALT, everybody loves to do this.\n\n342\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.170\nThey love to take this and put this here.\n\n343\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.809\nRemember what did I say about\nthis little handle guy?\n\n344\n00:16:18.809 --> 00:16:20.179\n>> It's not going to do it.\n\n345\n00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:23.267\n>> It's not a path\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n346\n00:16:23.267 --> 00:16:24.318\n>> That's close enough to what\n\n347\n00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:24.846\nI was saying.\n\n348\n00:16:24.846 --> 00:16:26.520\nIt's not going to do it.\n\n349\n00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.150\nSo, all you have to do is just\npoint it in the right direction.\n\n350\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.450\nAll you gotta do is point\nit to like there, okay?\n\n351\n00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.130\nNot out there.\n\n352\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.950\nThis is not a path, this is not a point,\nthis is a handle, this is a direction.\n\n353\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.560\nSo, if I just point it there,\nlet go of the mouse.\n\n354\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.990\nSo now I've pointed this way, I click.\n\n355\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.565\nWell, let's try that again.\n\n356\n00:16:44.565 --> 00:16:46.120\n[LAUGH] I go ahead and click.\n\n357\n00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.440\nThere we go.\n\n358\n00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.450\nAnd now, I've clicked, but\nit's going to keep on going straight.\n\n359\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.470\nSo, I hold the Alt, I direct it up.\n\n360\n00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.560\nSo, there's the direction up, and\nthen I click hold and drag down, and\n\n361\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.180\nthen I get that.\n\n362\n00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.580\n>> So, you're really just converting\nfrom curve to straight point, or\n\n363\n00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.520\ncorner point back to curved.\n\n364\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.670\n>> Yeah.\nIn this, really,\n\n365\n00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.080\nwe're actually breaking the seesaw.\n\n366\n00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.920\n>> Okay.\n>> We're changing the direction.\n\n367\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.260\nWe're converting the handles,\nif you want to say,\n\n368\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.540\nto be independent from each other, so it\nchanges the direction of the corner point.\n\n369\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.779\nNow, actually talking about what you were\njust saying of actually converting it.\n\n370\n00:17:20.779 --> 00:17:23.472\nThat would be something like over here.\n\n371\n00:17:23.472 --> 00:17:29.500\nOkay, so this we know is a straight,\nstraight, straight.\n\n372\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.470\nWell here if I want to convert,\nlet me actually get the convert tool,\n\n373\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.860\nwhich is Shift+C which seems like a weird\nhot key, but if you use this enough,\n\n374\n00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.020\nI use it all the time.\n\n375\n00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.210\nSo, there's the convert anchor point tool.\n\n376\n00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:44.653\nI know that this right here, If I want\nto convert it, if I just click on it,\n\n377\n00:17:44.653 --> 00:17:49.271\nclick and hold because holding is gonna\ngrab the directions an go like that.\n\n378\n00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:52.919\nNow, I could make it go back,\nbecause this is a curve right,\n\n379\n00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:56.353\nI want to make it go back to\nstraight you just click on it and\n\n380\n00:17:56.353 --> 00:18:01.920\nthere it goes back to straight, so same\nwith over here because I can click on it.\n\n381\n00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.740\nGo like that.\n\n382\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.210\nNow another thing if I did here.\n\n383\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.460\nIf I'm' still on the convert anchor\npoint tool, I'm in the actual tool not\n\n384\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.880\nin the toggle I was doing, I could\ntake this, and if I wanted to change\n\n385\n00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.900\nthe one seesaw then I could go ahead and\nbreak this in like that.\n\n386\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.030\nThen I create something like this.\n\n387\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.820\nNow once I've broken it, but\nnow I want to change it a little bit more,\n\n388\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.045\ndon't stay in that tool.\n\n389\n00:18:23.045 --> 00:18:27.320\nBecause that tool is only used\nto convert or break the handles.\n\n390\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.040\nThen you just go back to\nthe white arrow tool.\n\n391\n00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.600\nYou've already got it in the right\ndirection to actually change how you want\n\n392\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.460\nto do it is with the white arrow now,\nand I could make a cool surf's up\n\n393\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.811\nlogo type thing, and\nhit the beach or something like that.\n\n394\n00:18:41.811 --> 00:18:43.550\n>> [LAUGH] Now, I don't know, okay, well,\n\n395\n00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.976\nI saw a wave in there somewhere,\nnow I've lost it.\n\n396\n00:18:45.976 --> 00:18:46.837\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n397\n00:18:46.837 --> 00:18:47.570\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n398\n00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.000\nthat's the convert anchor point tool.\n\n399\n00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.840\nWhile I'm still on this, and when,\n\n400\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.370\nI haven't forgot about our good\nold friend Bezieay, or no?\n\n401\n00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.270\n>> Not good.\n>> Bezzie.\n\n402\n00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.940\n>> Bezzie.\n>> Bezzie.\n\n403\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.140\nGood old Bezzie, okay?\n\n404\n00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.390\nHere, going along the same\nidea of modifying a path.\n\n405\n00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.970\nWell, we've got the add and then subtract.\n\n406\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.180\nThat makes pretty much sense.\n\n407\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.530\nSo, if I wanted to make\nthis turn into this,\n\n408\n00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.460\nyou get the subtract anchor point tool.\n\n409\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.650\nAll I gotta do is just hover over that,\nyou're gonna get this all the time,\n\n410\n00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.730\nit's because of my mouse cursor is so\nbig, because I'm doing the demonstration,\n\n411\n00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.800\nthat this will always show up because,\nsaying that you can only use the delete\n\n412\n00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.030\nanchor point tool if you're\nactually on a point on a path.\n\n413\n00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.040\n>> So you might have clicked\njust slightly off of it?\n\n414\n00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.050\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n415\n00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:34.880\nAnd sometimes, instead of me just kind\nof going in blind, going in cold.\n\n416\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.250\nYou might want to use like the white arrow\ntool first to just at least get to where,\n\n417\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.720\nI can see that, that is the point\nthat I want it to go, and\n\n418\n00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.430\nkind of like select it, almost.\n\n419\n00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.860\nI'm selecting before I effect,\nright, select effect.\n\n420\n00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.530\nSo, I can go over here now.\n\n421\n00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.670\nAnd now I can actually,\nI hope I can pick it up.\n\n422\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:52.500\nThere we go.\nPerfect.\n\n423\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.740\nSo, I clicked on like the very tip of\nthe pen and that's where, honestly,\n\n424\n00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.440\nthat caps lock might actually work\na little bit better because right there on\n\n425\n00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.990\nthat crosshair, that's where I'm going\nto be using to delete an anchor point.\n\n426\n00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:07.760\nThe same idea goes for\nthe adding an anchor point.\n\n427\n00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.570\nIf I just go to the add anchor point tool,\nand\n\n428\n00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.480\nthen I take the tip of the pen and\nadd a point there, add a point there, and\n\n429\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.860\nmaybe just for\nfun we can just add a couple points.\n\n430\n00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.530\nNow, adding points, I'm not gonna move it.\n\n431\n00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.660\nRight?\nWhat tool do you go back to move points?\n\n432\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.140\n>> We need a white arrow tool.\n\n433\n00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.600\n>> Correctomundo.\n\n434\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.660\nSo, now I go ahead and take these,\nand then I can move them out, oops,\n\n435\n00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.380\ngotta get the point, and\nthen you can move them in and out and\n\n436\n00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.960\ndo all sorts of wonderful things.\n\n437\n00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.740\n>> Very neat.\n>> So that's that.\n\n438\n00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.230\nAnd then just one last thing,\n\n439\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:41.095\nso we told you I'd come back to\nour friend Bezzie and our circle.\n\n440\n00:20:41.095 --> 00:20:43.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if I wanted to create this,\n\n441\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.455\nnow let's see if I can recreate this,\nhonestly.\n\n442\n00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:47.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know I can, it's just my\n\n443\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.757\n>> Not look like a Brontosaurus anymore.\n\n444\n00:20:49.757 --> 00:20:52.780\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> So, here, I can start, let's say,\n\n445\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.770\nstart about like right here.\n\n446\n00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.930\nBy the end, and I'm going to click,\nhold, and drag up,\n\n447\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.400\nbecause I know I'm going across the tail.\n\n448\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.060\nSo, I want the tail to go up, and\n\n449\n00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.450\nthe next one, I want to do is I\nkind of come down here, right?\n\n450\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.630\nNow, this is where I could\ncreate like a little whoop.\n\n451\n00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.010\nOkay, well that, there we go.\n\n452\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.760\nAnd, I can kind of come around here,\nmaybe go around there.\n\n453\n00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.890\nSee, it's just kinda following along.\n\n454\n00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.720\nAnd then I can go here.\n\n455\n00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.120\nMake my little hoofs.\n\n456\n00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.000\nWell, now it's turned into a horse.\n\n457\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.990\nSo we go here and\njust kinda curve around and camel.\n\n458\n00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.840\n>> I think a camel will work.\n\n459\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.516\n>> A camel with a long tail.\n\n460\n00:21:34.516 --> 00:21:35.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know, with this key\n\n461\n00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.600\npaintings it is often hard to tell what\nthey were trying depict so, we're good.\n\n462\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.530\n>> Now of course I can go back\nto my white arrow tool and\n\n463\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.970\nstart moving things around and ow,\nthere we go, now it's a real camel.\n\n464\n00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.720\nThat's a two-hump camel, there we go.\n\n465\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.187\nSo now we've got a Convert tool camel.\n\n466\n00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:55.750\n[LAUGH] I don't know,\nI'm just making it up.\n\n467\n00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.100\nAll right, so\nas you can see that you just go along.\n\n468\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.310\nNow, this is actually a good point to\nshow you about the rubber band option,\n\n469\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:09.470\nbecause I couldn't really tell where\nI was going and what was going on.\n\n470\n00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.880\nSo, if I'm go back to my regular pen tool,\nand\n\n471\n00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.030\nI go back to the preferences that I was\nshowing you, because it didn't show me\n\n472\n00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.395\nany preview of where the path\nmight go if I kept on, right.\n\n473\n00:22:22.395 --> 00:22:22.980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n474\n00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.210\n>> So if I take the rubber band option on,\nI'm just gonna click, hold, and drag up.\n\n475\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:31.610\nAnd I'm gonna go like, do you see how\nit's showing me like where I'm going,\n\n476\n00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:36.910\nand then I can kind of go here and\nthen I can,\n\n477\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:42.220\nnow here I know I want to go back up,\nso you still have to\n\n478\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.820\nknow the mechanics of a pen tool, but at\nleast here it kind of gives you a little\n\n479\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:52.040\nbit more guidance as to where it's going.\n\n480\n00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.990\nAnd I'm kinda creating a couple\nmore points along the way.\n\n481\n00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.204\nNow I think I'm gonna go for a turtle.\n\n482\n00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.440\nThere, there's my turtle.\n\n483\n00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.280\nSo that's a neat feature\nthat's on the pen tool.\n\n484\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.610\nBut if you don't understand the pen at\nall, It's not gonna make any sense, okay?\n\n485\n00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.460\nAnd then, of course, I can go back\nover to my convert anchor point\n\n486\n00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.570\ntool if I really wanted to and\nconvert that to a straight point, see?\n\n487\n00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:21.050\nNow it actually kind of\ncomes in a little bit more.\n\n488\n00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:25.030\nAnd then I can go back to my white arrow\ntool and start moving things around and\n\n489\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.815\nmake him,\nhe's looking more like a dinosaur again.\n\n490\n00:23:27.815 --> 00:23:29.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there you go.\n\n491\n00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.090\nThere's this\n>> There it is\n\n492\n00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:36.300\n>> One thing that I'd like to add right\n\n493\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.860\nnow is we've been using the pen tool,\nand to me the pen tool is where you can\n\n494\n00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:46.310\nreally control every single curve,\nthe breaking, all of that.\n\n495\n00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.445\nThere is the pencil tool, now the pencil\ntool, It does the same idea of like,\n\n496\n00:23:51.445 --> 00:23:55.874\nyou have the pencil with the star and\nthen the pencil with nothing.\n\n497\n00:23:55.874 --> 00:23:58.583\nBut it is a free form path drawing tool,\nand\n\n498\n00:23:58.583 --> 00:24:01.760\nit's going to make all of\nyour points as you draw.\n\n499\n00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.763\nIts like taking an actual pencil and\njust drawing.\n\n500\n00:24:04.763 --> 00:24:07.824\n>> So it's freeform, okay.\n\n501\n00:24:07.824 --> 00:24:13.100\nSo if I take the pencil which is\nover here, okay, there's the pencil.\n\n502\n00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.134\nNow you also have the smooth tool,\nwhich is pretty awesome, I will show you.\n\n503\n00:24:17.134 --> 00:24:24.620\nBut the pencil, still gotta keep along the\nsame idea that if I click hold and drag.\n\n504\n00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.110\nAll right, it's just gonna make a line.\n\n505\n00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.780\nAnd there's that, right?\n\n506\n00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.264\nSo I can make my little turtle or\nbrontosaurus guy, and\n\n507\n00:24:33.264 --> 00:24:38.670\njust works like you would think that\nyou were drawing with a pencil, okay?\n\n508\n00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.300\nNow it does make paths along the way,\ndoesn't it?\n\n509\n00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.749\n>> It looks like what it's\ndoing is putting the paths and\n\n510\n00:24:43.749 --> 00:24:46.920\nadjusting those bezier handles for\nyou based on what you've drawn.\n\n511\n00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.335\n>> Yeah, and\nit's making all the points along the way.\n\n512\n00:24:49.335 --> 00:24:53.741\nSo, and you still have all the same\nediting capabilities, it's still there.\n\n513\n00:24:53.741 --> 00:24:55.972\nOkay, and I can use my add and subtract.\n\n514\n00:24:55.972 --> 00:24:57.945\nOkay, hello.\n\n515\n00:24:57.945 --> 00:25:03.250\nI didn't really want this guy,\nlike maybe I don't want this point.\n\n516\n00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.760\nI watch all of them are good.\n\n517\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.170\nMaybe that one right there,\nsomething like that.\n\n518\n00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.880\nSo I can take the minus and\nI can delete that point.\n\n519\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.560\nAnd I can add a point, and I can do all of\nthe same stuff that I would normally do.\n\n520\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.240\nIt's just that you draw it freeform, okay?\n\n521\n00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:23.110\nNow the only thing that I would just\nkind of caution you guys on is here.\n\n522\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.040\nI'm trying to get a blank space.\n\n523\n00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.860\nIf I was I don't know, just drawing\nthe flower or something, right?\n\n524\n00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.820\nOkay, there's that.\n\n525\n00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.396\nNow, if I come here look at what happens\nto the pencil, it has nothing, right?\n\n526\n00:25:35.396 --> 00:25:40.977\nWhich means if I think I'm just gonna draw\na leaf or a petal, it is continuing on.\n\n527\n00:25:40.977 --> 00:25:45.376\nSo that's something you got to be\nkinda careful about is if I'm drawing\n\n528\n00:25:45.376 --> 00:25:50.300\nsomething like this and then wanna make\nlike another offshoot off of that.\n\n529\n00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.581\nIf I take this,\nI'm actually just redoing it.\n\n530\n00:25:52.581 --> 00:25:56.850\nWhich is kinda good if you wanted to,\nwait, let's go this way now.\n\n531\n00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:02.320\nAnd it's gonna keep on taking that\nsame path and continue along.\n\n532\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:09.700\nBut if I wanted to create a flower and\na stem, if I say okay, here's my, wow.\n\n533\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.640\nThere's my flower and\nI want the stem to be separate.\n\n534\n00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.200\nI'm not gonna go here.\n\n535\n00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:19.120\nI'm gonna go a little bit further down so\nI get the star.\n\n536\n00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.688\nMake my little stem and then I can go back\nto the black arrow tool and, so on and so\n\n537\n00:26:23.688 --> 00:26:26.666\nforth and take this and\nmake it a different color and\n\n538\n00:26:26.666 --> 00:26:28.766\nthat is a messed up looking flower.\n\n539\n00:26:28.766 --> 00:26:31.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the idea is if you want two\n\n540\n00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:35.760\nseparate paths you got to look for\nthe pencil with the star.\n\n541\n00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.657\n>> Right, cuz if it sees you,\nif you're drawing on top of another path,\n\n542\n00:26:38.657 --> 00:26:40.540\nit thinks that you wanna\ncontinue that path.\n\n543\n00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.890\n>> Mm-hm, yep,\nit's always about the mouse cursor icons.\n\n544\n00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.910\nBut the pencil is really,\nit's very nice because it is freeform.\n\n545\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.228\nSo especially if you have a stylus and\nyou're actually drawing on your tablet,\n\n546\n00:26:50.228 --> 00:26:52.710\nit can be really great,\nand you're freeforming.\n\n547\n00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.845\nAnd then you're like,\nwell then I don't wanna use the pen.\n\n548\n00:26:54.845 --> 00:26:58.262\nYou still will use the pen, I promise you,\nyou will learn how to use the pen.\n\n549\n00:26:58.262 --> 00:27:00.072\nAnd you might fight against it, but\n\n550\n00:27:00.072 --> 00:27:03.870\nyou will come around to it cuz\nit's an awesome, awesome tool.\n\n551\n00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:04.680\n>> Very good, all right, Vonne.\n\n552\n00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.530\nWell thanks for all that information,\nI know I'm ready to dive in,\n\n553\n00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:08.684\nstart using that pen tool.\n\n554\n00:27:08.684 --> 00:27:11.550\nHopefully everybody out\nthere is ready as well.\n\n555\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.370\nDon't be scared of the pen.\n\n556\n00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.390\nAll right, we thank you for that.\n\n557\n00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.040\nWe hope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n558\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.550\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n559\n00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:19.092\n>> I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n560\n00:27:19.092 --> 00:27:21.229\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n561\n00:27:21.229 --> 00:27:28.900\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:19.300\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.340\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.610\nwe're going to be looking\nat transforming objects.\n\n6\n00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.580\nWe've learned how to create\nobjets several different ways.\n\n7\n00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.980\nAnd a lot of really cool objects we\ncan create with the tools that we've\n\n8\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.940\nseen so far.\n\n9\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.080\nBut sometimes, the object can maybe\nbe not exactly what you want and\n\n10\n00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.910\nthat's when these other\ntools come into play.\n\n11\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.820\nAnd here to help us with that is Ms.\nVaughn Smith.\n\n12\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.570\nHow you doing, Vaughn?\n\n13\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.430\n>> Great.\n\n14\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.520\nYes, we are going to be\ntransforming objects.\n\n15\n00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.020\nAnd I've actually kind of blended quite\na few different things together in this\n\n16\n00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.530\nepisode.\n\n17\n00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.270\nBecause almost all the things we're going\nto cover falls under the object menu.\n\n18\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.090\nSo that's why we're transforming objects.\n\n19\n00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.800\nBut we're also going to look at\nsome tools, and some neat things.\n\n20\n00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.293\nWe're going do some blends.\n\n21\n00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:02.651\nAnd some gradient meshes.\n\n22\n00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:07.455\nAnd we're going to scale, and\nwe're going to move all over the place.\n\n23\n00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:08.810\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sounds exciting.\n\n24\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.690\n>> Yes, it's going to be very exciting.\n\n25\n00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.670\nSo, why don't we jump on in.\n\n26\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.580\nSo I've got a file here.\n\n27\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.600\nWith quite a few different\nart boards to just\n\n28\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.240\ngive the examples of all the different\ntechniques that I want to show you.\n\n29\n00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.010\nSo we have what we've learned\nabout our black arrow tool, right?\n\n30\n00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.480\nWe go ahead and take the black\narrow tool to select things.\n\n31\n00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.900\nAnd I mean, we can move things around.\n\n32\n00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.300\nWe can rotate it, so I've got the black\narrow with this square selected.\n\n33\n00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.400\nWe can rotate with the bendies.\n\n34\n00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.510\nWe went ahead and used our shift\nkey to go ahead and size it.\n\n35\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.570\nWe can use our alt key or\nour option key to keep it center.\n\n36\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.330\nThere's a lot of things that we can\ndo just with the black arrow tool.\n\n37\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.870\nSo why would we need a command to move or\n\n38\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.950\nwhy do we have a scale tool if\nI can just scale it right here?\n\n39\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.490\nWell, it's really just options.\n\n40\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.600\nI mean different ways to do it.\n\n41\n00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.230\nSo that's what I want to go ahead and\ngo through with you.\n\n42\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.320\nBecause, yes, rotate scale, move.\n\n43\n00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.630\nAll the black arrow tool, but\n\n44\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.270\nwhat if I want to turn it over,\nokay, like reflect, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.000\nSo that's one of the transformations\nthat you could do.\n\n46\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.280\nI mean, you could turn it around and\nflip it this way,\n\n47\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.110\nbut it's just easier if I can\nsay just flip horizontal, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.390\nIn Photoshop, I know there's\nthe flip horizontal, flip vertical.\n\n49\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.190\nIt's the exact same thing, basically.\n\n50\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.680\nJust in Illustrator so let me show you.\n\n51\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.555\nI have this arrow that I created and\nI'm going to ahead and select.\n\n52\n00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:29.080\nSo I'm going to go to the Object menu.\n\n53\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.875\nSee Object.\n\n54\n00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:31.780\n[LAUGH] We got our transform.\n\n55\n00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.990\nAnd you can see,\nthere's a couple different ones we can do.\n\n56\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.070\nMove, rotate, reflect, scale and shear.\n\n57\n00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.130\nWell, since I said we were going to\nreflect, we're going to choose that one.\n\n58\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.120\nAll right?\nSo then, what can I do with this?\n\n59\n00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.470\nAgain, flip on horizontal or\nthe vertical axis.\n\n60\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.690\nYou could also specifically choose\nwhich angle you want to go with.\n\n61\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.670\nBut the biggest thing to remember,\nI think, is to just turn on the preview.\n\n62\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.680\nBecause you could change\nall these options, but\n\n63\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.340\nit's like, what is it actually doing?\n\n64\n00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.690\nBecause I can't remember.\n\n65\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.500\nAm I supposed to go up or down, vertical?\n\n66\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.430\nWhich way?\n\n67\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.750\nThat's exactly what I wanted.\n\n68\n00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.360\nI wanted to flip it over, so\nthat way I chose vertical.\n\n69\n00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.770\nThat's what I want to do.\n\n70\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.530\nYou can see that you can\nchange your different options.\n\n71\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.290\nYou can change the angle.\n\n72\n00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.580\nNope.\nI just wanted to go ahead and\n\n73\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.060\nflip it over, and that's great.\n\n74\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.860\nAnd that's all I have to do,\nand I can click OK.\n\n75\n00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.892\nBut then there's another option\nif you wanted to copy it.\n\n76\n00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:24.670\nOkay so just do the transformation\nto that option, or\n\n77\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.140\nto that object, or\ncopy it over to another one.\n\n78\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.640\nSo just for fun,\nI'm going to go ahead and copy it.\n\n79\n00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.420\nAnd then I can go ahead and\nmove this over.\n\n80\n00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.335\nAnd now I have two\narrows pointed together,\n\n81\n00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:35.150\nbecause maybe that’s what I wanted to do.\n\n82\n00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.625\n>> So, did the transformation but\ncreated a new object.\n\n83\n00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:38.390\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n>> And\n\n84\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.220\nthen applied the transformation to that,\nbut not the original object.\n\n85\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.060\n>> Cool.\n\n86\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.745\n>> Hence,\nI’ve always loved to use the word hence.\n\n87\n00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:45.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hence the copy.\n\n88\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.670\nAll right and I think you can get the idea\n\n89\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.900\nhere from the other arrow\n>> I did want to show\n\n90\n00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.390\nyou that once you have it selected with\nthe black arrow, you can right click.\n\n91\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.130\nInstead of going into the object menu.\n\n92\n00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.490\nAnd, you can go to the transform,\nand I can go through reflect here.\n\n93\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.670\nAnd because I have that preview on,\n\n94\n00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.370\nI can say that verticals' definitely\nnot the way I want to go.\n\n95\n00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.200\n>> And then I go with horizontal,\nthat's what I want.\n\n96\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.870\nAnd just to keep on going with that copy,\nI'll copy that and\n\n97\n00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.170\nnow I'll go ahead and\nhave that arrow that way.\n\n98\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.970\nSo, really a quick command.\n\n99\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.660\nAnd I have to use it a lot, so\nnow you guys know where it's at.\n\n100\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.790\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n101\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.365\nthen there's some fun ones to\ndo with this Transform again.\n\n102\n00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:29.160\nBecause what if I took this square,\nand I went ahead and made it smaller?\n\n103\n00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.210\nAnd I'm just using the black arrow tool.\n\n104\n00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.710\nI'm not using any of the transform\ncommands in the object menu,\n\n105\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.140\nI just made it smaller, right?\n\n106\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.760\nWell, there is,\nI'm selecting the other square.\n\n107\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.260\nThere is an option to transform again,\nexactly what it sounds like.\n\n108\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.520\nDo the same transformation that I just did\n\n109\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.390\nagain to this other object\nthat I have selected.\n\n110\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.010\n>> Wow!\n>> So I've selected the second one,\n\n111\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.400\nI'm going to go to show you in\nthe Menu where the command is.\n\n112\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.260\nIt's transform again.\n\n113\n00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.380\nIt's command D or control D,\nwhich is duplicate.\n\n114\n00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.950\nSo you can kind of think of it that way.\n\n115\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.280\nSo control, there you go.\n\n116\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.260\nSo now I've done that, and\nI can even select this one.\n\n117\n00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.435\nAnd I'm going to do the shortcut.\n\n118\n00:05:09.435 --> 00:05:10.710\nCommand D, and that just goes forward.\n\n119\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.110\nSo that's where it's really cool.\n\n120\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.340\nDo the same thing.\n\n121\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.910\nI made everything smaller, but\nall these other guys need to be smaller.\n\n122\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.910\nAnd I could have selected\nall of those two together.\n\n123\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.340\nJust to show you one more time,\nI did this.\n\n124\n00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.040\nAnd then I can go ahead and\nsay, yep, do that again.\n\n125\n00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.830\nAnd I can have them both\nselected at the same time.\n\n126\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.480\nSo that's another really handy\ncommand that I use frequently.\n\n127\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.190\nIt's like nope,\nI just gotta get it a little bit more.\n\n128\n00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.930\nSo that command or control D is\nreally fun for the transform again.\n\n129\n00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.713\nAnd then there's\nthe transform each option.\n\n130\n00:05:44.713 --> 00:05:49.770\nAnd that's where you don't want to just\nmove or just scale or just rotate.\n\n131\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.940\nYou can do it all in one dialogue box.\n\n132\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.560\nAnd that's where it can get a lot easier\nso I'm going to select this square.\n\n133\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.220\nI'm going to go to the object.\n\n134\n00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.830\nI'm going to go to transform and\ntransform them each.\n\n135\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.020\nOkay.\nIt means like each option.\n\n136\n00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.710\n>> Mm.\n>> If you want to say.\n\n137\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.600\nSo you see, there's scale, move, rotate.\n\n138\n00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.220\nThe reflect we were doing\nwith the reflect command.\n\n139\n00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.160\nThey're all in one dialogue box.\n\n140\n00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.520\nSo it's like, okay.\n\n141\n00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.790\nSo I'll check that Preview back on.\n\n142\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.030\nAnd I can maybe scale it down and\nscale it down horizontally.\n\n143\n00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.400\nAnd of course I could type it in if\nI want it 75% of the original size.\n\n144\n00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.000\nI can move it over a little bit maybe,\n\n145\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.590\nMove it up a little bit,\nrotate it on an angle, so on and so forth.\n\n146\n00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.840\nI think you get the idea, I can just\ngo ahead and change each one of these.\n\n147\n00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.170\nAnd, of course, you do have that copy.\n\n148\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.910\nOkay, just like before I'm just going\nto go ahead and click OK for this one.\n\n149\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.030\nAnd there you go, I did a whole\nbunch of transformations in one\n\n150\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.410\nshot rather than individually\nwith some of the other ones.\n\n151\n00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.120\nThere’s some fun things you\ncan do with the repeat.\n\n152\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.440\nAnd this is always one of my favorite\nexamples, because it’s very colorful and\n\n153\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.880\nit’s always with stars and\nI love stars and color.\n\n154\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.120\nSo we're going to go back\nto that transform each.\n\n155\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.700\nOkay, oops,\nI don't want to have all of these.\n\n156\n00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.650\nSo, I'll just go back and let's type in.\n\n157\n00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:11.130\nWe'll do 80% of the original on both\nthe horizontal and the vertical scaling.\n\n158\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.860\nSo, I'm just going to\nmake it a little smaller.\n\n159\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.990\nI don't want to move it, okay?\n\n160\n00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.530\nSo, I'm just going to\nput those back to zero.\n\n161\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.120\nAnd because I don't want that.\n\n162\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.330\nI'll make it rotate just a little bit,\neverything else is fine.\n\n163\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.940\nNow I'm going to go ahead and\nclick copy and it makes this.\n\n164\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.650\nAnd if you do that command D,\nit just kind of makes it.\n\n165\n00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.530\nSee?\n\n166\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.706\nIsn't that pretty?\n\n167\n00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:34.510\n>> Very cool.\n\n168\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.520\n>> This is where I could just go on and\non and on.\n\n169\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.450\nIf you just supply a gradient and\njust do the scaling and rotate it,\n\n170\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.550\nnow it looks like a beautiful flower.\n\n171\n00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.896\n>> It does.\n>> All right.\n\n172\n00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:49.388\nSo fun with command or control d.\n\n173\n00:07:49.388 --> 00:07:51.161\nAnd transformations.\n\n174\n00:07:51.161 --> 00:07:55.745\nNow there's another command that I\nwanted to show you called off set path.\n\n175\n00:07:55.745 --> 00:08:01.707\nWhich will look similar to what I was\ndoing here without the rotate part but\n\n176\n00:08:01.707 --> 00:08:04.970\nwhy is it different and why do we use it?\n\n177\n00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.064\nIt's just a different way of doing it,\nright.\n\n178\n00:08:07.064 --> 00:08:07.883\nOption, options.\n\n179\n00:08:07.883 --> 00:08:15.140\nAnd I can specify how far I\nwant this path to be offsetted.\n\n180\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.110\nAnd it can either go bigger or smaller.\n\n181\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.860\nIt's easiest to just demonstrate.\n\n182\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.640\nSo let's take this star,\nI'm going to go to object, and\n\n183\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.970\nI'm going to go to path, and I'm going\nto go to, there it is, offset path.\n\n184\n00:08:29.558 --> 00:08:30.270\nAll right.\n\n185\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.230\nNow, again that preview.\n\n186\n00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.700\nYou're gonna see why I'm\ntrying to pre balance.\n\n187\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.060\nI'm just offsetting this shape.\n\n188\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.985\nA whole, or however many,\nhowever much distance?\n\n189\n00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And space I want to go ahead and\n\n190\n00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.780\ngo off that original path.\n\n191\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.340\nSo if I go ahead and\nsay that I want it to be .15, or whatever,\n\n192\n00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:53.090\nyou can see that it’s\nexactly .15 inches off of it.\n\n193\n00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.800\nNow, if it’s a positive,\nit’s going to go bigger.\n\n194\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.480\nI’m going to click okay so you can see it.\n\n195\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.160\nAnd it goes behind it.\n\n196\n00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.210\nI’m going to change this color right here.\n\n197\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:06.090\nIt’s just like a, it’s basically\nduplicating it, and offsetting it.\n\n198\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.890\nThat's just what offset path means.\n\n199\n00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:14.920\nOkay, and so you can specify how far off\nthat whole shape is going to come off.\n\n200\n00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.730\n>> Very cool.\n>> So\n\n201\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.920\nit's very similar to that\ntransform scale and do a copy.\n\n202\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.120\nBut you can't do a Cmd+D.\n\n203\n00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.290\nYou cannot transform again,\ntransform again on an offset path.\n\n204\n00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:29.310\nSo that is one big differentiating factor,\nso and\n\n205\n00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.950\nyou can do an offset path in a negative,\nand it will go small and on top.\n\n206\n00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:40.240\nSo positive bigger beneath,\nnegative smaller on top.\n\n207\n00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.660\nSo just to show you I'm clicking\nback on my original yellow star.\n\n208\n00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:50.970\nGo back to the offset path and\nthis time I can do a negative .15.\n\n209\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.650\nI can preview so you can see it goes in.\n\n210\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.850\nSo you can go ahead and\nmake something like that.\n\n211\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:58.510\n>> Very cool.\nSo\n\n212\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.980\nagain you can have more fun with\nmodifying an original object and\n\n213\n00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.720\nhow you can transform it,\ntransforming objects.\n\n214\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.335\n>> Nice.\n\n215\n00:10:06.335 --> 00:10:09.210\n[LAUGH]\n>> So those are the few,\n\n216\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.940\nthat's the first art board with\na few examples I wanted to show you.\n\n217\n00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.960\nSo I'm gonna come over, whoops,\nI'm gonna come over here [LAUGH] sorry.\n\n218\n00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.840\nAnd just wanted to show you how you could\nuse that move command, not just with using\n\n219\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.160\nyour black arrow tool, but use it cuz you\nwant to make a specific grid of something.\n\n220\n00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.340\nLike I want four circles across and\n\n221\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.000\nten circles down that all need to\nbe .25 inches away from each other.\n\n222\n00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.960\nOkay.\n\n223\n00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.280\nSo I'll select this circle,\ngo to that move, and,\n\n224\n00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.820\nI don't really want it to go down.\n\n225\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.400\nGot that preview, love that.\n\n226\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.270\nSo I want that horizontal to be .25,\ndid I say that?\n\n227\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.700\nMaybe we'll do, actually that's\nnot enough so we'll do this.\n\n228\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.140\nWe're gonna do a 0 on the vertical because\nyou can see that 0.25 is not far enough,\n\n229\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.410\nso I actually should have took\ninto accommodation the actual\n\n230\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.650\nwidth of the shape to\nknow exactly how far.\n\n231\n00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.145\nBut this is why the preview's so\ngreat and you can do the math.\n\n232\n00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:08.730\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna go ahead and\nlet's do a 2.5.\n\n233\n00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.830\nThat's a little too much.\n\n234\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.704\nSo maybe 1.5?\n\n235\n00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.740\nThat's close enough.\n\n236\n00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.434\nI think you guys can get the idea\nthat I want it to be 1.5 inches\n\n237\n00:11:17.434 --> 00:11:19.660\naway from that middle point.\n\n238\n00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.799\nSo it's moving over exactly 1.5.\n\n239\n00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:27.414\nSo actually the space in between,\nagain, gotta think about how far away,\n\n240\n00:11:27.414 --> 00:11:31.520\nsorry, how wide the object\nis that you're moving.\n\n241\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.830\nFor here we're just going to go ahead and\nclick copy, and this is where I can do\n\n242\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:40.250\nthat command D and then duplicate that and\nthen if I wanted it to go\n\n243\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:45.740\ndown the same amount, you can select\nall of them and then do the same thing.\n\n244\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.290\nThat's, we are going to the move.\n\n245\n00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.490\nSo we are going to move and I'm going to\nsay I'm not going to go horizontally this\n\n246\n00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.600\ntime, I want to go down, right?\n\n247\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.318\nSo I'll make a 0 on the horizontal.\n\n248\n00:11:55.318 --> 00:11:57.870\nA 1 .5 on the vertical.\n\n249\n00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.270\nI can see that it’s that\nexact measurement down,\n\n250\n00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.580\nI click copy and\nI could just do that again.\n\n251\n00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:11.360\nSo you can quickly start making grids of\nitems that you want a specific measurement\n\n252\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.330\napart from each other, or moving it\nover a specific amount that you want.\n\n253\n00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:22.340\n>> Definitely trying to click and drag and\nmake those exactly the same distance\n\n254\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.640\napart can be very tedious work, whereas a\ntool like that, you can do it very quick.\n\n255\n00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.660\n>> Yep.\nMove, move, move, move.\n\n256\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.740\n>> And there exact.\n\n257\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.730\n>> Copy, copy, copy, copy.\n\n258\n00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.860\n>> So people like us that are a little\non the OCD side on that stuff,\n\n259\n00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.740\nwe got it exactly, yes.\n\n260\n00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.650\n>> Yes.\nNumbers.\n\n261\n00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.670\nNumbers never lie.\n\n262\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.490\n>> That's right.\n\n263\n00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.820\n>> So.\nSometimes we want them to but,\n\n264\n00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.875\nthey never lie.\n\n265\n00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:42.650\n[LAUGH].\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.460\nI have another command I can be really\nhandy and this is really good if\n\n267\n00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.150\nI need for I need to say break things\nup into six quadrants so cuz I\n\n268\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:56.009\nalways think about this when I'm basically\nimpositioning something on my own and\n\n269\n00:12:56.009 --> 00:13:00.375\nimpositioning, what that means in\nprinting terminology is how they take\n\n270\n00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:03.965\nmultiple pages of let's say like a book or\n\n271\n00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:09.215\nsomething and position them up on a large\nsheet of paper that's going to be printed\n\n272\n00:13:09.215 --> 00:13:13.280\nthat will then come around and be chopped\ninto individual pieces to be put together.\n\n273\n00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.340\nSo in positioning is just a layout.\n\n274\n00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.530\nYou can buy those business card\ntemplates they can print on your own\n\n275\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.480\nthat have the perforated sides and\neverything.\n\n276\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.000\nIt’s kind of like that how many\nup on a page to you want to have.\n\n277\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.940\nSo if I was doing nametags or something\nthat I know was going to be printed out\n\n278\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.270\nand cut, you can do the split into grid,\nwhich can be really handy.\n\n279\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.760\nSo I'm going to take, and\nI'm not being accurate on this one so\n\n280\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.080\nyou can get the idea.\n\n281\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.030\nI just have this square and\nI want to well, split it into a grid.\n\n282\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.740\nSo we go to object and we go to path.\n\n283\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.450\nAnd we go to split into grid.\n\n284\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.250\nAnd this is where having\nthat preview is always good.\n\n285\n00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.960\nHow many rows do I want?\n\n286\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.670\nYou can see it actually breaks it up.\n\n287\n00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.150\nHow many columns do I want?\n\n288\n00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.360\nMaybe I want three.\n\n289\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.536\nSo we have nine squares.\n\n290\n00:13:57.536 --> 00:14:02.790\nThe gutter is the space between the items.\n\n291\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.740\nSo if I bump up this gutter to be 0.3 and\n\n292\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.190\nthis is 0.3 you can see that it's\nactually taken that original size and\n\n293\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.769\nthen breaking it up and\naccommodating all the grids that I have.\n\n294\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.750\nThose are the gutters that\nI have designated and\n\n295\n00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.750\nnow I have a 3 x 3 in a nice little grid.\n\n296\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.030\nYou can even add some guides,\nwhich can be really good.\n\n297\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.440\nSo you could just use this just\nto even make column guides.\n\n298\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.450\nWhich you can't really do quickly in Well,\n\n299\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.980\nwe can still do it,\nthis is another way, sorry.\n\n300\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.140\nCuz in InDesign you can go ahead and\nset that really quickly,\n\n301\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.590\nyou can still do it,\nit's just this is one other way, so.\n\n302\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.250\n>> Very cool.\n>> So there you go,\n\n303\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.655\nyou can see I've got my guides here and\nI've got my grids.\n\n304\n00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:49.255\nAnd then if I, you know,\nif you really wanted to,\n\n305\n00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:50.905\nyou could just delete all these.\n\n306\n00:14:50.905 --> 00:14:53.075\nActually I should probably\nlock my guides first.\n\n307\n00:14:53.075 --> 00:14:55.035\nThere you go.\nKeep the guides,\n\n308\n00:14:55.035 --> 00:14:56.275\nget rid of all the squares.\n\n309\n00:14:56.275 --> 00:14:59.510\nAnd I don't know why that just happened\nagain, even though I tried to lock them.\n\n310\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.500\nOkay.\n\n311\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.730\nThere we go.\nI'll have to do one individually.\n\n312\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.090\nBut you can go ahead and get rid of them.\n\n313\n00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.640\nJust leave the guides there by\nusing that split to grip command.\n\n314\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.356\nMake sure all your math adds up.\n\n315\n00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:11.503\nThat's important.\n\n316\n00:15:11.503 --> 00:15:12.042\nOkay.\n\n317\n00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:15.440\nAll right, so\nwe were doing some rotating and\n\n318\n00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.770\nreflecting using the menu commands,\nwhich you also have Tools that can do it.\n\n319\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.510\nIt seems like an overkill.\n\n320\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.810\nI've got tools, I got black air,\nI got a transform menu.\n\n321\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.680\nHence just options.\n\n322\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.740\nSo you could go through here and\nuse your tools you have right over here.\n\n323\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.030\nYou have a Scale,\nyou also have a shear tool, and\n\n324\n00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.570\nthen over next to it you have a rotate and\nreflect.\n\n325\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:39.840\nSo it's really just kind of,\n\n326\n00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.590\nit's almost like a free form\nrather than using a dialog box.\n\n327\n00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:47.430\nOkay, so if I wanted to, again it seems\nlike overkill, I can use rotate, and\n\n328\n00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.800\nthen I can go ahead and\nrotate it, and that's fine.\n\n329\n00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.549\nJust like I would with the black arrow,\nbut a big difference here would be,\n\n330\n00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:55.406\nyou see that little guy right there?\n\n331\n00:15:55.406 --> 00:16:00.293\nThat's your point of origin of where\nit's actually rotating Around.\n\n332\n00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.665\nAnd by default, with the black arrow tool,\nit's always gonna go ahead and\n\n333\n00:16:03.665 --> 00:16:04.850\njust rotate from itself.\n\n334\n00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.000\nBut here what you can do,\nis you're gonna actually click.\n\n335\n00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.160\nSo I've clicked off of it.\n\n336\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.130\nSo see now this guy's off that way.\n\n337\n00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.867\nAnd now if I reposition the orientation\nof where the rotation's gonna happen, so\n\n338\n00:16:17.867 --> 00:16:21.918\nwhen I move this star you see how it's\ngonna rotate based on that anchor\n\n339\n00:16:21.918 --> 00:16:24.340\npoint of where I want to rotate it around.\n\n340\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.990\nSo that's an advantage of\nwhy I'd want to use a tool.\n\n341\n00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.040\n>> Can you show us that again?\n\n342\n00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.900\nI missed where you got the actual\ncenter point to move it way out\n\n343\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.620\nthere in the first place.\n\n344\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.260\n>> Perfect.\n\n345\n00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.930\nHere.\nHere, I will start over.\n\n346\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.980\nSo I've got this, I just went to\nthe black arrow tool and I got my star.\n\n347\n00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.500\nWhen I go to the tool here,\nyou really just have to click.\n\n348\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.990\nYou don't have to drag it.\n\n349\n00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.710\n>> You don't have to select\nthe center point first or anything?\n\n350\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.470\n>> No, you don't have to.\n\n351\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.570\nYou're just saying, I want it here.\n\n352\n00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.620\nWait nope, there, nope there,\nthere, okay that's where I want it.\n\n353\n00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.960\nSo you just click where you\nwant that orientation to be and\n\n354\n00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.730\nthen it will go ahead and\nrotate around that.\n\n355\n00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:02.250\nAnd it's the same thing with\nthe rest of the tools as well.\n\n356\n00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.130\nThey have that orientation\nthat you could do.\n\n357\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.330\nSo if I wanted to do this shear.\n\n358\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.440\nSo now I'm shearing, right?\n\n359\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.190\nI'm shearing based on that origin.\n\n360\n00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:18.560\nBut I could click off over here, and\nthen shear it with that origin over there.\n\n361\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.350\nSo that's a nice little advantage.\n\n362\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:25.789\nAnd there's one that I always like to do,\nthis little trick-\n\n363\n00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:26.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.595\n>> Because again,\n\n365\n00:17:27.595 --> 00:17:31.820\nit was the whole thing about duplicating\nand making flowers and things like that.\n\n366\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.317\nIt goes along the same lines here.\n\n367\n00:17:33.317 --> 00:17:35.950\nSo I have this circle, right?\n\n368\n00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.310\nAnd I'm gonna go with the rotate tool.\n\n369\n00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.570\nAnd because we know we know can\nchange the orientation, this is where\n\n370\n00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:45.370\nif I had perfect grids and the exact size\nof the circle you could get it just right.\n\n371\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.801\nAgain there's that math coming back in.\n\n372\n00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:51.360\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna move\nthe point of origin a little bit.\n\n373\n00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.970\nMaybe I'll move it a littler further,\nI'll move it over here.\n\n374\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.950\nSo now, I'm going to use that Alt+drag,\nlike the duplicate, right?\n\n375\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.020\nSo I'm gonna Alt+drag, hold the Alt,\nand I'm gonna drag the circle and\n\n376\n00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.860\nit's gonna rotate round.\n\n377\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.784\nAnd then I'm gonna use that Cmd+D or\nCtrl+D, to go ahead and\n\n378\n00:18:06.784 --> 00:18:10.948\n[SOUND] make it all, see that's,\nit didn't match up to exactly.\n\n379\n00:18:10.948 --> 00:18:14.610\nBut then you could go ahead and you know,\ndraw another circle or something.\n\n380\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.282\nThis is where I'll stop because I'll start\ngetting carried away with making pretty\n\n381\n00:18:19.282 --> 00:18:20.672\ncolors and everything.\n\n382\n00:18:20.672 --> 00:18:25.232\nSo then you can move this over here,\nand this is where if you had the right\n\n383\n00:18:25.232 --> 00:18:28.813\ngrid and I knew exactly where\nthat rotation was back on.\n\n384\n00:18:28.813 --> 00:18:32.885\nI'm not gonna get it exact here,\nbut I think you get the idea.\n\n385\n00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:37.757\nOkay, and there's somewhat of a center,\nAlt+drag, and then you can go ahead and\n\n386\n00:18:37.757 --> 00:18:38.461\njust hold.\n\n387\n00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:43.092\n[SOUND] And then you can make some\nreally interesting looking patterns or\n\n388\n00:18:43.092 --> 00:18:44.875\njust flowers, in my mind.\n\n389\n00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:47.305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we can just keep on making flowers.\n\n390\n00:18:47.305 --> 00:18:50.500\nBut that's my fun little\ntrick too that I'll stop now.\n\n391\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.020\n>> It looks great, I love all the tips\nyou've shown us because some of those\n\n392\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.110\nshapes that you come up with are really\ncool and really complex and would have\n\n393\n00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:00.750\nspent me days to figure out how you made\nthat shape or trying to recreate that.\n\n394\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.400\nAnd in reality, there's some cool little\ntricks you can do to come up with those.\n\n395\n00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.740\n>> And you see these things.\n\n396\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.121\nI mean, you see this in vector\ngraphics and everything.\n\n397\n00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:08.308\nIt's like, that's how they make that.\n\n398\n00:19:08.308 --> 00:19:08.974\n>> Yeah.\n\n399\n00:19:08.974 --> 00:19:10.702\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n400\n00:19:10.702 --> 00:19:14.090\nAll right, so\nlet's move over to Envelope Distort.\n\n401\n00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.360\nOkay, just different ways that we\ncan make things look different.\n\n402\n00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.398\nThere's Make With Warp and Make With Mesh,\nyou can see these two options.\n\n403\n00:19:20.398 --> 00:19:22.760\nNow you could do it on text or\nyou can do it on just the shapes.\n\n404\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.610\nSo that's why I have\nboth of these options.\n\n405\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.130\nWe'll start with the text.\n\n406\n00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.180\nAnd I will go to Object and\nEnvelope Distort.\n\n407\n00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.370\nWarp and Mesh.\n\n408\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.671\nIf you do the Make With Warp,\n\n409\n00:19:33.671 --> 00:19:36.522\nif you're familiar with Photoshop\nthis will look familiar.\n\n410\n00:19:36.522 --> 00:19:42.880\nI mean this looks exactly like\nthe text options, like the text warp.\n\n411\n00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.500\nText wrap?\n\n412\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.450\nYeah, text warp.\nSo\n\n413\n00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.680\nit's almost the exact same dialogue box.\n\n414\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.700\nPreview.\n\n415\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.000\nGotta turn that preview on.\n\n416\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.020\nSo you can see, I can use an Arc,\nor I can do the Bulge, or the Rise.\n\n417\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.070\nYou can just go through\nthe different styles of text.\n\n418\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.750\nSorry, it's not text.\n\n419\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.830\nIt's just warp options.\n\n420\n00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.450\nSee, I'm going to back to Photoshop.\n\n421\n00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:05.080\nAnd I can make with my Arc, and\nthen I can change the type of bend.\n\n422\n00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.700\nI can change the vertical distortion,\nand I can kinda.\n\n423\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.900\nThat's a little bit much.\n\n424\n00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.050\nOkay, I think you get the idea.\n\n425\n00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:12.020\nYou just start.\n\n426\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:12.630\nDrag it left.\n\n427\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.820\nDrag it right.\nSee what it does.\n\n428\n00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.740\nMake some fun stuff.\n\n429\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.940\nMaybe I'll make this a little less.\n\n430\n00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:22.480\nAnd there's my style, my arc warp,\nand I'm gonna click OK.\n\n431\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.770\nNow what did it actually do?\n\n432\n00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.200\nIt's taken the object that you have and\n\n433\n00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.870\nthen applying the shape and\nthen mashing it up into it.\n\n434\n00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.860\nThat's the easiest way I can explain it.\n\n435\n00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:38.690\nBut this is where, now that I have it,\nwhat if I wanted to change the text or\n\n436\n00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.820\nchange the type of warp?\n\n437\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.860\nLike I wanted it to bend less or\nbend more.\n\n438\n00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.950\nThat's up here.\n\n439\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.750\nYou can see that now it shows me\nthat I do have an envelope warp and\n\n440\n00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.190\nthere's these two buttons\nright next to it, okay?\n\n441\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.100\nOne is the object itself,\nand one is the warp.\n\n442\n00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.700\nI'm going to turn that off.\n\n443\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.910\nSo you can see right now,\nthat this left one is on.\n\n444\n00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.280\nYou can see that I can\nchange the style right here.\n\n445\n00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.780\nIt's actually controlling.\n\n446\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.210\nThere's that bend again that I can go\nahead and make that different, and so\n\n447\n00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:07.380\non and so forth.\n\n448\n00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.345\nSorry, wrong keyboard stroke.\n\n449\n00:21:09.345 --> 00:21:13.960\n[LAUGH] But if I wanted to change\nthe text, maybe I want a different color.\n\n450\n00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.810\nIf I click the Edit Contents button,\n\n451\n00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:19.950\nyou can see that now this is\nshowing the character panel.\n\n452\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.410\nI could go ahead and change the font.\n\n453\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.870\nBecause maybe I want it to be like that,\nor I can change the color.\n\n454\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.150\nSo it's like,\nwhich one do you want to change?\n\n455\n00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.090\nThe distortion, or the content?\n\n456\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.230\nAnd that's what those two\nbuttons will do for you.\n\n457\n00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.920\nAnd because I'm on the content,\nif I wanted to actually change the text,\n\n458\n00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.690\nif I just double click on this.\n\n459\n00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:45.690\nSee it's actually going to get me\ninto that drilldown, Isolation mode.\n\n460\n00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.680\nAnd then I can come into here,\njust double click with that, and\n\n461\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.000\nI can say, Hello, or whatever.\n\n462\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.380\nSo I can change the text by going\ndown into it because it's showing,\n\n463\n00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.960\nand I'm just double clicking off of it.\n\n464\n00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.910\nIt's the distortion and the text\ntogether and they are still separate.\n\n465\n00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.590\nSo you can modify them differently, okay?\n\n466\n00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.866\nAnd if you go back to the Object menu,\nand because I had it selected, and\n\n467\n00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:10.449\nI go back to the Envelope Distort,\n\n468\n00:22:10.449 --> 00:22:14.236\nyou can see that I could release it if I'm\nlike nope, I don't want that to happen.\n\n469\n00:22:14.236 --> 00:22:19.632\nSo if I release it, now you can actually\nreally see how it took this shape,\n\n470\n00:22:19.632 --> 00:22:24.260\nand then use that to put this text\ninside of it if you want to say.\n\n471\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.242\nOr use that as a container in\nthe type of transformation and\n\n472\n00:22:28.242 --> 00:22:30.200\nmodification that it does.\n\n473\n00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:37.130\nYou can always release a Envelope's\nDistort if you wanted to, or a Mesh.\n\n474\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.180\nIt doesn't matter which one.\n\n475\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.441\nAnd just really quickly, I wanted to\nshow you what it means to expand.\n\n476\n00:22:42.441 --> 00:22:45.889\nSo let's just say I made with Warp, and\nI'll just keep the same options and\n\n477\n00:22:45.889 --> 00:22:46.400\nclick OK.\n\n478\n00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.810\nI want it to now just be, okay?\n\n479\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.420\nAnd that's what the Expand\ncommand actually does.\n\n480\n00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.742\nWe talk about it later\nwhen we do the live trace.\n\n481\n00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:58.460\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n482\n00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.720\n>> There's a couple things in\nhere that you will see expand,\n\n483\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.320\nespecially with the live trace,\nwhere we expand it out.\n\n484\n00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.530\nSo this is where I want to,\nwell you can either go here,\n\n485\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.740\nthere is an Expand command, but\nit also is in the Angle of Distort.\n\n486\n00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.890\nYou can see Expand,\nit means like really just take hold, like,\n\n487\n00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.680\ndo not keep it separate.\n\n488\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.480\nThis is one item so\nnow it's it's just a path, okay?\n\n489\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.283\nIt's just, this is what I got,\nand here's my weird looking star.\n\n490\n00:23:22.283 --> 00:23:25.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, a few more.\n\n491\n00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.400\nWith Mesh, same idea,\njust different technique.\n\n492\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:33.610\nThe Make With Warp is\nalmost like pre-sets, okay?\n\n493\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:37.406\nHere, if I go to the Make With Mesh,\n\n494\n00:23:37.406 --> 00:23:42.270\nyou're actually putting in a mesh\ngrid of where you can edit\n\n495\n00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:47.440\nindividual points to distort the object.\n\n496\n00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.900\nSo I'm gonna Make With Mesh, and\nthat sounds good, 4 and 4, and\n\n497\n00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.690\nI'll show you why.\n\n498\n00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:52.530\nThere we go.\n\n499\n00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:57.360\nSo we've got, there's one, two, three,\nfour, columns, if you want to say,\n\n500\n00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.401\none, two, three, four, rows.\n\n501\n00:23:59.401 --> 00:24:00.964\nand where those rows and\n\n502\n00:24:00.964 --> 00:24:04.960\ncolumns intersect become a point\nof what I can use to modify.\n\n503\n00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.810\nSo if we're ever gonna modify points,\nwhat are we gonna use?\n\n504\n00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.120\n>> The white arrow tool.\n\n505\n00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.992\n>> Yes, you paid attention.\n\n506\n00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:12.869\n[LAUGH] And\nI didn't tell you it was coming.\n\n507\n00:24:12.869 --> 00:24:17.520\n[LAUGH] So yes, if I go to the white\narrow tool, you can see that I can click\n\n508\n00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.730\na specific point, and then I can,\nindividually, make those points,\n\n509\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.750\nand I can move them over, and\nI can do some really weird things here.\n\n510\n00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.600\nAnd you see how because of the grid,\nhow far apart columns,\n\n511\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.500\nif you wanna say, that's where you could\nsee where it's kinda going on each side,\n\n512\n00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.420\nthen stopping at this particular point.\n\n513\n00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.350\nSo the more mesh, you just have more\npoints that she can be able to manipulate.\n\n514\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.450\nAnd the space between those points\n\n515\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:49.140\nbecomes like how much is distorted between\npoint A and point B, if you wanna see it.\n\n516\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.910\nAnd it goes along with the same things\nwe did with the pen tool, right?\n\n517\n00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.480\nWe're just finishing that.\n\n518\n00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.910\nSo the pen tool, you have your bezier\nhandles, and then you can go ahead and\n\n519\n00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.450\nuse any of the pen tool options.\n\n520\n00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.875\nYou could so\nthe breaking of the see-saws, I call it.\n\n521\n00:25:03.875 --> 00:25:06.630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you can use some of those same\n\n522\n00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.320\noptions here.\n\n523\n00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:13.940\nSo you can make some really interesting,\ncrazy types of distortions with the mesh.\n\n524\n00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.610\nOkay?\n>> Cool.\n\n525\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.238\n>> And so that looks really weird.\n\n526\n00:25:16.238 --> 00:25:16.960\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes.\n\n527\n00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then the same thing.\n\n528\n00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.830\nYou could go ahead and either expand it,\nor you can release it and\n\n529\n00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.810\nthen you can move on from that way.\n\n530\n00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.040\nSo make it happen or take it off, right?\n\n531\n00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.060\nSo amp or distort.\n\n532\n00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.250\nLots of different ways that you can\nmanipulate or transform your objects.\n\n533\n00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.560\nOkay, a few more blends?\n\n534\n00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.267\nThis is another one of my favorites,\n\n535\n00:25:39.267 --> 00:25:41.477\nbecause you can do some\nreally fun color stuff.\n\n536\n00:25:41.477 --> 00:25:44.101\nSo what is a blend, and\nit's not a gradient, but\n\n537\n00:25:44.101 --> 00:25:47.754\nit will kinda look like one because\nI'm using colors but it blends.\n\n538\n00:25:47.754 --> 00:25:55.910\nIt's basically like morphing if you\nwant to say from one object to another.\n\n539\n00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.010\nBest to show.\n\n540\n00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.110\nI'm going to add these two\nsquares blue and yellow.\n\n541\n00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.960\nI want to blend them together.\n\n542\n00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.640\nSo I'm going to select\nthe items that I want to blend.\n\n543\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.810\nI'm gonna go to object, I'm going to go\nto blend, and I'm going to go to make.\n\n544\n00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.480\nAnd it's.\n\n545\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.070\nIsn't that pretty?\n\n546\n00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.760\nIt gets better.\n\n547\n00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.970\nSo I just did the default one.\n\n548\n00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.080\nJust make.\n\n549\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.580\nAnd now as you can see up in the control\npanel it does tell me that this is\n\n550\n00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:29.400\na blend, and it's just doing\nthe specific blend option that we chose.\n\n551\n00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.610\nWell, which one is that?\n\n552\n00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:31.773\nWell, let's go back.\n\n553\n00:26:31.773 --> 00:26:34.024\n[INAUDIBLE] Got it selected.\n\n554\n00:26:34.024 --> 00:26:36.800\nObject, blend, blend options.\n\n555\n00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.310\nSo if I go to the Blend Options,\nand here's that preview again, so\n\n556\n00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.890\nI can see it.\n\n557\n00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.850\nYou can see the different types\nof they call it, spacing.\n\n558\n00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.200\nThe different types of blend objects.\n\n559\n00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.160\nThis is smooth color, so it's just going\nto smoothly go all the way through.\n\n560\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.870\nBut you can also choose,\nI like specified steps,\n\n561\n00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:55.230\nbecause that's where you can really start\nseeing the morphing if you want to say.\n\n562\n00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.070\nNow it's giving me a specific number.\n\n563\n00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.970\nI'm going to go really small,\nso you can see this.\n\n564\n00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.790\nI hit the tab key.\n\n565\n00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.940\nSee that bump, bump, bump, bump, bump?\n\n566\n00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.930\nYou can change that, so\nyou can actually see the steps.\n\n567\n00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.020\nI like the steps part,\n\n568\n00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.990\nbut there’s definitely reasons why\nyou want to use the smooth color.\n\n569\n00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.910\nOr the end of the specified\ndistance would be,\n\n570\n00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.420\nof course,\nstarting to play around with that.\n\n571\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.340\nSo, if I did point one,\nyou can see that it starts to,\n\n572\n00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.210\nthe spacing increases 0.5,\nso on and so forth.\n\n573\n00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.590\nSo a specified step and\nspecified distance is similar.\n\n574\n00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.195\n>> Same but different, that kind of thing.\n\n575\n00:27:28.195 --> 00:27:30.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll go with the specified steps,\n\n576\n00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.050\nand I'm gonna click OK.\n\n577\n00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:36.680\nNow this is it's,\nthis goes along the same idea of\n\n578\n00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.910\nusing the white arrow tool to edit\npoints or specific parts of a whole,\n\n579\n00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.690\nso if I'm using the black arrow tool,\nit's gonna give me everything.\n\n580\n00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.720\nIf I go to the white arrow tool,\nI'm gonna click off of this, so\n\n581\n00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.640\nI can kind of deselect it.\n\n582\n00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.590\nSee how it's letting me\nselect that yellow square,\n\n583\n00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.940\nor select that blue square, and\nyou can see up in the transform.\n\n584\n00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.880\nSo if I want to change this to pink,\nI can change that.\n\n585\n00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.770\nOr I could change this particular,\nwell, where it's actually coming from.\n\n586\n00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:09.410\nI can make it closer together,\nor I can move it around.\n\n587\n00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.780\nOkay, so I can change some\ndifferent things about this, or\n\n588\n00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.830\nI can change this one point.\n\n589\n00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:19.100\nYou can see I still have the editing\ncapabilities of the two objects, and\n\n590\n00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.850\nyou're not editing those\nindividual pieces between them.\n\n591\n00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:29.240\nYou're only editing the one or the two,\nthe two objects that you used to blend.\n\n592\n00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.350\nNow that line or that path of where it's\nblending, you can see that's where that\n\n593\n00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:37.930\nhovering over, that's the path\nthat it's following to blend.\n\n594\n00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:39.470\nWell, that's editable as well.\n\n595\n00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:40.000\n>> No way.\n\n596\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.640\n>> Yeah,\n>> So I want it instead of being straight,\n\n597\n00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.060\nI want to curve,\njust back to those pen tools, right?\n\n598\n00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.050\nWe can go to that anchor point tool, and\n\n599\n00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:53.580\nI can convert this from a straight\npoint to a curved point.\n\n600\n00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.430\nI push it this way, there we go.\n\n601\n00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.680\nNow I can curve it around.\n\n602\n00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.710\n>> I could add a point on the path.\n\n603\n00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.560\nSo it's just right here.\n\n604\n00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.800\nWait there we go.\n\n605\n00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.530\nWell you can add a point,\nwell actually you would add an object.\n\n606\n00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.100\nAnyways you can do all the options.\n\n607\n00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.270\nOkay so you can go here,\nyou can move it, I can change that.\n\n608\n00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.920\nI can use the convert.\n\n609\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.720\nIt's lots of fun.\n\n610\n00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.950\nSo it is still a path, and\nyou can blend them together.\n\n611\n00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:25.380\nAnd you don't have to blend just one item.\n\n612\n00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.810\nSo, that's why we have three.\n\n613\n00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.180\nSo I could go ahead and take this.\n\n614\n00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.620\nI can go ahead and blend them,\nand I can say Make.\n\n615\n00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.790\nIt's still using that smooth, but now\nit's got some, It is just for fun, okay.\n\n616\n00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:42.361\nSo you can add as many shapes as you want,\nand different items,\n\n617\n00:29:42.361 --> 00:29:46.071\nand you can blend them,\nyou can change the steps and\n\n618\n00:29:46.071 --> 00:29:50.399\nthe paths, and all that fun staffs,\nand then back to here.\n\n619\n00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:55.062\nRemember you do have that release\nlike I don't want them to blend or\n\n620\n00:29:55.062 --> 00:29:58.490\nexpand fully come together and\nbecome one item.\n\n621\n00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.080\n>> Mm.\n>> So you have those same options that you\n\n622\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.620\nhave with the envelope sort\nwith the blend option as well.\n\n623\n00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.538\n>> Those are pretty cool.\n\n624\n00:30:05.538 --> 00:30:08.160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then we have the gradient mesh.\n\n625\n00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.940\nSo this is where I thought about should\nI put gradient mesh with the gradients,\n\n626\n00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.680\nor when we go into color or should I\nkeep them with all the transforms?\n\n627\n00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:24.680\nBecause this is really isn't a menu\noption, but it's the same but different.\n\n628\n00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.800\n>> But different.\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah and\n\n629\n00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.010\nit kind of goes with color and\nkind of goes with transform, so\n\n630\n00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.250\nI just went ahead and put it here.\n\n631\n00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.180\nAll right?\nSo here we go.\n\n632\n00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:36.180\nA gradient mesh is whenever\nwe make with mesh, like,\n\n633\n00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.230\nthe actual envelope to store it where it\ncreated a grid, and it just went ahead and\n\n634\n00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:45.437\nmade a block grid formation over that\nstar or that text that I've used,\n\n635\n00:30:45.437 --> 00:30:49.170\nand that's how many defining columns and\nrows that I have.\n\n636\n00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.340\nWhen you do a gradient mesh, it's still\ngonna do the mesh, and you're still gonna\n\n637\n00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:58.610\nbe able to edit individual points,\nbut you can apply color, which you\n\n638\n00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:04.610\ncan't do with the envelope distort, make\nwith mesh, there are no color changes.\n\n639\n00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:07.240\nAnd the mesh that we're doing here,\n\n640\n00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.440\nthe gradient mesh, it's actually going\nto follow the shape of the path.\n\n641\n00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.530\nIt's not just going to be in\na regular grid formation.\n\n642\n00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:18.230\nIt's going to be based upon the shape\nthat you're applying it to.\n\n643\n00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.080\nSo let me show you.\n\n644\n00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.840\nI've got my black square selected.\n\n645\n00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.120\nAnd I'm going to come over here to.\n\n646\n00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.190\n>> Or star.\n\n647\n00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.657\n>> Did I?\n[LAUGH] I'm glad you're paying attention.\n\n648\n00:31:29.657 --> 00:31:31.185\n[LAUGH]\n>> We knew what you meant.\n\n649\n00:31:31.185 --> 00:31:34.345\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, the is a star.\n\n650\n00:31:34.345 --> 00:31:37.790\n[LAUGH] Because that's\nwhat I thought I said.\n\n651\n00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.730\nAlright, so we'll go with\nthe mesh tool right over here.\n\n652\n00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.240\nIt just looks like a little spiderweb.\n\n653\n00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.000\nAnd it is right next tot he gradient tool,\nso it's the mesh tool.\n\n654\n00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.536\nSo I'm gonna take this, and all I'm gonna\ndo is I'm going to click, and the very\n\n655\n00:31:49.536 --> 00:31:53.885\nfirst click that I make is I'm making\na point on the intersection of the grid.\n\n656\n00:31:53.885 --> 00:31:56.776\nSo if I just click [NOISE]\nyou see how it added But\n\n657\n00:31:56.776 --> 00:31:59.372\nit didn't just go straight up and down.\n\n658\n00:31:59.372 --> 00:32:05.495\nIt actually follows there's the star,\nand that just where it follows the path.\n\n659\n00:32:05.495 --> 00:32:06.150\nPretty neat.\n\n660\n00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.770\nSo maybe I'll add another one.\n\n661\n00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:08.780\nThere's two.\n\n662\n00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.750\nSo now I added two points, but\n\n663\n00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.495\nit's actually making multiple grid points\nbecause of where they're intersecting.\n\n664\n00:32:14.495 --> 00:32:15.820\nOkay, so maybe I'll put like one up there,\n\n665\n00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.450\nand you can see now it's\nmaking a couple others.\n\n666\n00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:19.410\nBack to the white arrow tool,\n\n667\n00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.420\nbecause that's where we go\nto select individual points.\n\n668\n00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.558\nAnd you can still go ahead and move\nthem around like you did with the warp.\n\n669\n00:32:25.558 --> 00:32:27.876\nIt's not gonna make any sense\nuntil I actually apply color, so\n\n670\n00:32:27.876 --> 00:32:29.503\nI'm going to just undo\nthat a couple times.\n\n671\n00:32:29.503 --> 00:32:31.130\nI've selected the one point.\n\n672\n00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.350\nI'm gonna come over to my swatches.\n\n673\n00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.330\nAnd then i'm just going to pick a color.\n\n674\n00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.830\nOoh!\n\n675\n00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:42.158\nThat's where you can say I'm applying\nthat pink to just that one point.\n\n676\n00:32:42.158 --> 00:32:43.590\nAnd I could come up to here, and\n\n677\n00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.690\nI can apply color to just\nthat one point as well.\n\n678\n00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:47.240\nCome over here.\n\n679\n00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.540\nSo you can make some really,\n\n680\n00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.870\nreally interesting color gradient\npatterns if you want to say.\n\n681\n00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:56.100\nIts not really patterns,\nit's just shading, really.\n\n682\n00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:02.250\nI'm telling, if you look up gradient\nmesh illustrations in Illustrator,\n\n683\n00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.620\nthere's the most amazing lifelike things.\n\n684\n00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.290\nIt looks like a photograph.\n\n685\n00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.540\nIt doesn't look flat.\n\n686\n00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.580\nYou can do so much with just the colors\nand the shading of something.\n\n687\n00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:17.204\nIt makes it look like an actual 3D object,\nand it's not vector, it's really,\n\n688\n00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:18.029\nreally cool.\n\n689\n00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.947\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n690\n00:33:18.947 --> 00:33:23.410\n>> I think if you look up, I think it\nis gradient mesh flower, you'll see.\n\n691\n00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.960\nIt's so pretty, it's so neat.\n\n692\n00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.311\n[LAUGH] Very intense.\n\n693\n00:33:26.311 --> 00:33:30.340\nYou have to have that artistic eye.\n\n694\n00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:37.240\nI don't think I could ever recreate what I\nhave seen people do with gradient meshes.\n\n695\n00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:37.800\nBut it's amazing.\n\n696\n00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.228\nSo yep, grab your points,\nmove them around.\n\n697\n00:33:40.228 --> 00:33:43.953\nYou can go ahead and start applying\ncolors, and this is where, yeah,\n\n698\n00:33:43.953 --> 00:33:47.425\nyou can go ahead and move these points and\nthis is where it starts,\n\n699\n00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:50.330\nI start thinking about,\nremember those marbles?\n\n700\n00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.606\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n701\n00:33:51.606 --> 00:33:53.260\n>> The colored marbles?\n\n702\n00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:57.080\nMy aunt had a whole collection of them,\nI just love playing with those things.\n\n703\n00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.880\nSo you can see when I click off of them,\nI mean, I don't know\n\n704\n00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.210\nexactly if that's a real looking marble,\nbut it just reminds me of that idea.\n\n705\n00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.980\nThese kind of swirling colors together,\nand you can do some really neat\n\n706\n00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.590\noptions with gradient meshes, and\nthat's what I got for you in this episode.\n\n707\n00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.562\n>> Fantastic, some really cool\nthings you can do, above and\n\n708\n00:34:15.562 --> 00:34:18.353\nbeyond what we were used to\nwith our normal transform,\n\n709\n00:34:18.353 --> 00:34:21.886\nreally cool things that we can do\nto our objects within Illustrator.\n\n710\n00:34:21.886 --> 00:34:24.006\nSo, is that right?\n\n711\n00:34:24.006 --> 00:34:24.714\nAre we doing Illustrator?\n\n712\n00:34:24.714 --> 00:34:26.157\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n713\n00:34:26.157 --> 00:34:26.732\n>> Yeah, let's do that again.\n\n714\n00:34:26.732 --> 00:34:29.097\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n715\n00:34:29.097 --> 00:34:30.255\n>> I can't believe I haven't\n\n716\n00:34:30.255 --> 00:34:30.914\nfucked up yet.\n\n717\n00:34:30.914 --> 00:34:33.516\nSo I'm very proud of myself.\n\n718\n00:34:33.516 --> 00:34:35.230\n>> [COUGH] [SOUND] Excuse me.\n\n719\n00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.481\n>> I realize I went a little over, but-\n>> No, that was fine.\n\n720\n00:34:37.481 --> 00:34:43.302\n>> [SOUND] I'm so glad it was you,\ngotta end on a bang.\n\n721\n00:34:43.302 --> 00:34:45.526\n>> I didn't want to do the last\nepisode with no edits.\n\n722\n00:34:45.526 --> 00:34:47.091\nMegan wants something to do tomorrow.\n\n723\n00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:49.735\n>> Right?\n\n724\n00:34:49.735 --> 00:34:51.894\nWe're looking out for you Megan.\n\n725\n00:34:51.894 --> 00:34:55.552\nWe want to give you work.\n\n726\n00:34:55.552 --> 00:35:00.860\n[LAUGH] Cuz we're bastards.\n\n727\n00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.920\n>> Because we suck.\n\n728\n00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.920\n>> Pretty much.\n\n729\n00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.040\n>> For the life of me I couldn't remember\nthe name of any of the freaking tools,\n\n730\n00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.615\nwe just went over.\n\n731\n00:35:07.615 --> 00:35:08.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was just like,\n\n732\n00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.340\nwe can do cool things with shapes and\nsuch that we saw.\n\n733\n00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.360\n>> We blended, we transformed,\nwe used menu options and tools.\n\n734\n00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.937\n>> Yeah.\n>> You did some cool things with\n\n735\n00:35:15.937 --> 00:35:17.022\nthe blends and the warps.\n\n736\n00:35:17.022 --> 00:35:17.823\n>> That's right.\n\n737\n00:35:17.823 --> 00:35:18.609\nWarps too.\n\n738\n00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:20.738\n>> Yeah, warps and blends and\nsomething about envelopes.\n\n739\n00:35:20.738 --> 00:35:22.759\n>> Yeah, there we go, okay.\n\n740\n00:35:22.759 --> 00:35:25.070\n>> See,\nI'm gonna end up doing your work now.\n\n741\n00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.670\n>> I know, right?\n\n742\n00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:30.690\nCan we just put her voice over my face,\nand I'll just go, ba ba ba ba.\n\n743\n00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.860\nWow, found some really cool things we

00:00:20.857\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:24.512\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at color, and\n\n5\n00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:25.600\ncolor theory.\n\n6\n00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.330\nBelieve it or not,\nthere's a lot more to it than just\n\n7\n00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.810\nrandomly picking some color\nfrom your color palette.\n\n8\n00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.940\nHere to help explain color and\ncolor theory is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.750\nHow you doing, Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.170\n>> Great, good to be here to\ntalk to you about colors.\n\n11\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.460\nAs Mike was saying, it's not just let\nme just pick some random color and\n\n12\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.373\nthrow it in my production.\n\n13\n00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:48.040\nIt means something, and so\nthat's what we're here to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.970\nNow, color theory is\na subject that is huge.\n\n15\n00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.018\nWhole books are written\non just this one subject.\n\n16\n00:00:56.018 --> 00:00:58.460\nWe're just gonna try to\nhit the main points and\n\n17\n00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.280\nall the things that you will be seeing\nin your Illustrator environment\n\n18\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.920\nlater when we actually get into\nthe color panel, into the swatches.\n\n19\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.385\nBut for now, we're just here to\ntalk about the theory behind it and\n\n20\n00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:13.655\nget some vocabulary and\nsome topics covered, so\n\n21\n00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:19.099\nwe can understand what these numbers mean\nand what are these colors saying to us.\n\n22\n00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:20.490\nSo we're gonna go with that.\n\n23\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.080\n>> Sounds fun!\n\n24\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.222\n>> And we're gonna start off with\ntalking about our good friend ROYGBIV,\n\n25\n00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:26.750\nremember who ROYGBIV is?\n\n26\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.840\n>> I haven't heard his\nname in a long time, but\n\n27\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.300\nI do, I remember him from gosh,\nelementary school, I believe.\n\n28\n00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.110\n>> Yeah, there was always some song\nwe had to sing to remember it.\n\n29\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.860\nAnd what was ROYGBIV about?\n\n30\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.410\n>> It was the colors of the rainbow.\n\n31\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.500\nLet's see, you had ROYGBIV.\n\n32\n00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.580\nYou have red, orange, yellow,\ngreen, blue, indigo, violet.\n\n33\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.503\n>> Yeah.\n>> If I remember.\n\n34\n00:01:49.503 --> 00:01:50.394\n>> Good job.\n\n35\n00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:51.122\n>> That was a long time ago.\n\n36\n00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:52.640\n>> [LAUGH] It was.\n\n37\n00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.405\nSo let me bring up a little\ndocument to help us along and\n\n38\n00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:59.221\nremember our notes from kindergarten or\nwherever we learned about this.\n\n39\n00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:05.250\nSo yes, ROYGBIV, is exactly what Mike was\nsaying, it's the colors of the rainbow.\n\n40\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.570\nWhoops, sorry,\njust didn't mean to zoom out.\n\n41\n00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.916\nWe have these colors, and it's funny,\ncuz I remember being like what's indigo?\n\n42\n00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:15.654\nViolet, it's purple, yes, that's true.\n\n43\n00:02:15.654 --> 00:02:18.692\nWe think of it as purple but\nif you actually Google this,\n\n44\n00:02:18.692 --> 00:02:22.506\nthere's all sorts of different\narticles about indigo is not a color,\n\n45\n00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:25.176\nand violet's not here,\nand it's like, what?\n\n46\n00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:25.997\nI don't know.\n\n47\n00:02:25.997 --> 00:02:30.179\nThere's a lot of misconceptions\nof whether this is a color,\n\n48\n00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.951\nbecause the way that we think\nabout color has changed so\n\n49\n00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:37.969\nmuch from when these types of\ntheories became dogmas, and\n\n50\n00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.500\nthis is what we talk about\nwhen we talk about color.\n\n51\n00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.982\nBecause this was originally\nfrom Sir Isaac Newton.\n\n52\n00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:46.422\n>> Yeah, it was a long time ago.\n\n53\n00:02:46.422 --> 00:02:49.230\n>> Yeah, a very long time ago\nbefore science and computers and\n\n54\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.430\nnumbers and everything.\n\n55\n00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.959\nAnd it was really all based on light and\nthe rainbows and the prisms and\n\n56\n00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.310\nall the different ways of the optics that\nhe discovered and introduced to the world.\n\n57\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.717\nThey're talking about rainbow\ncolors being spectral colors,\n\n58\n00:03:05.717 --> 00:03:08.909\noptical colors, so\nthat's just what we see.\n\n59\n00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.203\nNow when you get into how that goes\ninto how we work with color and\n\n60\n00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:16.446\nthen painting and\nhow that moved through ages,\n\n61\n00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:22.080\nthen you get into what is a primary color,\nsecondary color, tertiary color.\n\n62\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.270\nLet's go over that.\n\n63\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.274\nSo do you remember these?\n\n64\n00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:26.259\n>> I do, barely.\n\n65\n00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.333\n>> [LAUGH] Red, yellow, and blue.\n\n66\n00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:30.990\nSo those are our primary colors.\n\n67\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.179\nThose are the ones that we use, remember\nwhen we talked about mixing paint and\n\n68\n00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.673\nwhat colors can make what?\n\n69\n00:03:36.673 --> 00:03:40.180\nWell, that becomes what we'd\nthink of are secondary colors.\n\n70\n00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.690\nWhen you mixed a primary and\nprimary together, you get our other\n\n71\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.770\ncolors of the rainbows as we wanna call\nit, like orange, green and purple.\n\n72\n00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.820\nWasn't there like the Baggies that\nthe yellow and blue make green,\n\n73\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.201\nthere was that commercial?\n\n74\n00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:56.250\n>> Right, to make sure your\nZiploc was closed properly.\n\n75\n00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.660\n>> Yes, and\nthat means you know you got that there.\n\n76\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.706\nSo that was mixing two primary colors.\n\n77\n00:04:02.706 --> 00:04:05.708\nWell, if you take a primary and\na secondary,\n\n78\n00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:09.070\nyou get what are called tertiary colors.\n\n79\n00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.050\nSo you have what we think of as\nred-orange, and yellow-green, but\n\n80\n00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.524\nthey also have some other names that\nthey can be referred to, as chartreuse.\n\n81\n00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:18.476\n>> Chartreuse.\n\n82\n00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:22.472\n>> You can get kinda fancy on there,\nand teal, and there's always that,\n\n83\n00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:23.279\nwhat is teal?\n\n84\n00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:24.090\nThat's not teal.\n\n85\n00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.564\nAnd then how we actually see color and\nwhat we think of as this is blue or\n\n86\n00:04:28.564 --> 00:04:32.590\nthis is green is really based on\na whole bunch of other things.\n\n87\n00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.530\nBut these are the names that you're going\nto come across when you're talking about\n\n88\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.710\ntertiary colors.\n\n89\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.942\nThis is one of those where if you if you\nstart Googling and get into Wikipedia\n\n90\n00:04:40.942 --> 00:04:44.586\narticles and you have all those links, you\ncan sit there for hours, just clicking on\n\n91\n00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:47.992\ndifferent topics, and like what is this,\nwhat is that and where does that go?\n\n92\n00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:49.469\nAnd so it's a really quite fun.\n\n93\n00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.845\n>> It is, I was looking at something and\nyou talk about colors that maybe not be\n\n94\n00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:56.180\ncolors, cuz pink is one of the ones I\nremember reading about is maybe not.\n\n95\n00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.510\nSome people don't think it's an actual\ncolor, you can't reproduce it.\n\n96\n00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.249\nYeah, you end up down the rabbit hole of\nthese different arguments of why it is, or\n\n97\n00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.778\nwhy it isn't.\n\n98\n00:05:02.778 --> 00:05:07.906\n>> Yeah, and you can't reproduce that\nwith light, or we talk about light or\n\n99\n00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:13.130\ninks, or what have you, so this yeah,\nthis definitely a big rabbit hole.\n\n100\n00:05:14.393 --> 00:05:18.850\nSo let's just keep on that kinda surface\nof the color theory, and go along with\n\n101\n00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.960\nthe things that we do need to know about\nwhen we're gonna start user Illustrator,\n\n102\n00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.190\nbecause these terms are gonna come\nup when we get into those panels,\n\n103\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.500\nlike I was saying.\n\n104\n00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.080\nIt's also good to know about when you're\ntaking any type of Adobe certifications,\n\n105\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.180\ncuz these things will come up.\n\n106\n00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.820\nLet's go into this color wheel and this\nis where it goes back to Isaac Newton,\n\n107\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.630\nwhere he was the first\none that introduced this.\n\n108\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.265\nAnd there's other people that came\nalong throughout history to use it and\n\n109\n00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.980\nmove it through its\nprogression of what we see.\n\n110\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.960\nBut it really kind of is based on these\n16 colors and so this is our wheel.\n\n111\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.300\nI'm sure we've seen this in\nmany different representations.\n\n112\n00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.095\nAnytime we're talking about color or\nyou're learning, in kindergarten, or\n\n113\n00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:04.072\nin tenth grade, we're taking art history\nand things like that so we've got here.\n\n114\n00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:08.642\nSo we're going to be working with these\ncolors and talking about different\n\n115\n00:06:08.642 --> 00:06:13.700\nways that you can group colors together,\nin a sense, and what those terms are.\n\n116\n00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.040\n>> So let's just start over here.\n\n117\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.435\nI have my Layers panel open just so\nyou can see, I've got a little,\n\n118\n00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:22.453\nit's almost like a PowerPoint presentation\nin Illustrator, using layers.\n\n119\n00:06:22.453 --> 00:06:23.248\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n120\n00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:25.990\nwe're gonna first talk\nabout analagous colors.\n\n121\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.360\nAnalagous colors are ones that\nare similar to each other.\n\n122\n00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.644\nSo I've kinda demonstrated here like\nthe ones that are greenish and blue,\n\n123\n00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:35.844\nthose would be similar to each other.\n\n124\n00:06:35.844 --> 00:06:38.639\nAnd then the orangey colors or\nthe greeny colors and\n\n125\n00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.356\nI'm gonna start adding wise to\nthe end of everything probably now.\n\n126\n00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:44.826\n[LAUGH] All right, so analogous colors.\n\n127\n00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:48.427\nThen you also have things\nlike complementary colors, so\n\n128\n00:06:48.427 --> 00:06:52.860\nto me, when I Iook at this,\nit's automatically Christmas, right?\n\n129\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.403\n>> Yes.\n\n130\n00:06:53.403 --> 00:06:55.153\n>> Red and green and that's all you see.\n\n131\n00:06:55.153 --> 00:07:00.349\nAnd that's because those two colors\nare across from the color wheel,\n\n132\n00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:05.910\nand so they are opposite but yet\nthey also complement each other very well.\n\n133\n00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.056\nBecause they're on those different ends\nof the spectrum, if you wanna say.\n\n134\n00:07:10.056 --> 00:07:14.658\nAnd we have another one, so you have here,\nsince we're here in Florida,\n\n135\n00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:18.012\nthis is where you automatically\nthink of our Gators.\n\n136\n00:07:18.012 --> 00:07:20.850\nGood old Gators there,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n137\n00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.730\nYou can see another one here,\npurple and yellow.\n\n138\n00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.939\nYou've probably seen\nthese color combinations,\n\n139\n00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:27.228\nyou see this a lot in schools.\n\n140\n00:07:27.228 --> 00:07:29.690\n>> I was just gonna say,\nthat makes me think of several schools.\n\n141\n00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.860\nLike LSU, for example, use purple and\nyellow and now I understand why\n\n142\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.420\nthat looks so good on their uniform,\nbecause they're complementary colors.\n\n143\n00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.990\n>> Yes, they make each color stand\nout really well against each other,\n\n144\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.130\nbecause of that complete\nopposite end of what the color\n\n145\n00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.040\nis in this color wheel,\nin this color theory, so now we see this.\n\n146\n00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.010\nNow, let's keep going down the line.\n\n147\n00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.669\nWe have our triadic colors, or\nour triads, and when you look at this,\n\n148\n00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:58.523\nit's a perfect triangle on\nthis 16 color wheel, and\n\n149\n00:07:58.523 --> 00:08:02.867\nthese kind of go back to that these are\ncomplementary colors, not complementary,\n\n150\n00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:05.560\nthese are primary colors,\nthat's what they are.\n\n151\n00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.297\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n152\n00:08:06.297 --> 00:08:09.280\n>> Primary colors are red,\nyellow and blue.\n\n153\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.648\nIt makes a perfect equilateral\ntriangle across these 16 colors,\n\n154\n00:08:14.648 --> 00:08:16.727\nso that's a triad color.\n\n155\n00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:20.714\nAnd then you get into your\nsplit complementary colors.\n\n156\n00:08:20.714 --> 00:08:25.510\nSo this split complementary,\nit's where red and\n\n157\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.900\ngreen are the complementary colors,\nbut you take your base,\n\n158\n00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.150\nwhich would be green in this situation,\n\n159\n00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.800\nand then you take the two adjacent\ncolors from that complementary.\n\n160\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.230\nYou have that kind of maroonishy color,\n\n161\n00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.020\nsee, I'm going with the y's again,\nand a red-orange color.\n\n162\n00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.050\nThose would be your split\ncomplements based off of green.\n\n163\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.288\nLet me give you another example over here.\n\n164\n00:08:52.288 --> 00:08:56.109\nYou can see that the base color\nwould be this blue right here and\n\n165\n00:08:56.109 --> 00:09:00.464\nso the split complement would be\nthat lighter orange and that yellow.\n\n166\n00:09:00.464 --> 00:09:03.505\n>> So you could start with any color,\nthat would be your base color, and\n\n167\n00:09:03.505 --> 00:09:05.761\nthen you would just go over\nto the complementary and\n\n168\n00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:07.666\nthen to either side of the complementary.\n\n169\n00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:10.066\n>> Yep, go across and\nthen one on each side.\n\n170\n00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:11.282\n>> Okay.\n\n171\n00:09:11.282 --> 00:09:17.220\n>> Now we're gonna get in to\nour tetradic rectangular.\n\n172\n00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.450\nThis is where you have two pairs\nof complementary colors, okay, so\n\n173\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.090\nyou have the red and the green and\nthen blue and then the orange, and\n\n174\n00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:30.050\nthose two complementary colors\ntogether make a tetradic, or\n\n175\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.500\na rectangular, type of color combination.\n\n176\n00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.080\nI got another one here so you can just see\nthat we've just got different complements\n\n177\n00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.330\ntogether to make that rectangle.\n\n178\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.720\nWhat's the difference between\na rectangle and a square?\n\n179\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.040\nSquares are equal sides, so\nthen you go to the equal distance of\n\n180\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.090\nthe colors in a square\nrather than a rectangle.\n\n181\n00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.788\nSo they're four evenly spaced\ncolors around the color wheel.\n\n182\n00:09:56.788 --> 00:10:00.876\nWe've got another one here just for\ndemonstration purposes and so\n\n183\n00:10:00.876 --> 00:10:03.583\nthat's where we've got, square colors.\n\n184\n00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:08.292\nIf we keep on moving down the color theory\npipeline [LAUGH], then you get into warm\n\n185\n00:10:08.292 --> 00:10:12.816\nand cool colors, and I almost feel\nthat this is almost self-explanatory.\n\n186\n00:10:12.816 --> 00:10:17.014\nWhen you think of warm, it's red,\nit's like on the shower handle, right,\n\n187\n00:10:17.014 --> 00:10:20.110\nyou got the red for the hot and\nthe blue for the cold.\n\n188\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.910\nSo that's where you have your warm and\nyour cool colors.\n\n189\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.760\nAnd that's really the basics\nof color theory and\n\n190\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.366\nhow colors complement and\nwork together on this color wheel.\n\n191\n00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:35.020\n>> It's fascinating Vonne, and\nyou say that's the basics, so\n\n192\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.060\nI assume that means there's even more.\n\n193\n00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.500\n>> Yes, we have a few more\nthings to go over in here.\n\n194\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.310\nLet's go move on down my art board.\n\n195\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.778\nI wanna just throw this in over here,\nis that we're talking about color, but\n\n196\n00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:49.910\nanother word that you can use for\ncolor is hue.\n\n197\n00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.650\nYou might see that throughout any\ntype of readings that you do.\n\n198\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.723\nAnd actually, a lot of this terminology,\nyou're gonna see kinda intermixed in\n\n199\n00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:59.670\nbetween each other, so but that comes\ndown a little lower on my art board.\n\n200\n00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.230\nLet's go on to what is a tint?\n\n201\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.720\nA tint is when you add white to a color.\n\n202\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.070\nYou can think of tint in\na couple of different ways, but\n\n203\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.530\nin this area of color theory,\nthis is what they mean.\n\n204\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:19.040\nYou add white to a base color like red,\nand then you're going to get\n\n205\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.280\nit's almost lighter and that's for\nlike lighter, less saturated.\n\n206\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.650\nAll of these words that people\ncould use to describe it.\n\n207\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.350\nThere are some more technical ways of\nthat Adobe thinks of as lightness and\n\n208\n00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.040\nbrightness, or in photography,\n\n209\n00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.370\nit might actually mean\nsomething slightly different.\n\n210\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.981\nBut a lot of the same terminology.\n\n211\n00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:40.220\nSo we have tints, we also have shades.\n\n212\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.356\nSo shades means is when you're\nactually adding black to a hue.\n\n213\n00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:46.984\nOkay, think about shade,\nyou're gonna get darker, so\n\n214\n00:11:46.984 --> 00:11:51.310\nanywhere from that red and\nthen to that darker or almost black.\n\n215\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.040\nYou can see the progression of where\nthose colors would go from here.\n\n216\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.490\nTones would be if you add grey to a hue.\n\n217\n00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.670\nYou can see just right here like\nalmost in the middle, right,\n\n218\n00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.270\nwith this one, this one and\nthis one, they're all shades of red,\n\n219\n00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.430\nyou might say, in regular terminology,\nif we're talking about this.\n\n220\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.510\nOr these are tones, or tints of red.\n\n221\n00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.310\nBut specifically, it's adding white,\nadding black or adding grey.\n\n222\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.740\n>> So,\nit is important how you got to that color.\n\n223\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.270\nDid you start with a base and add white?\n\n224\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.165\nDid you start with a base and\nadd blacks, or did you add greys?\n\n225\n00:12:23.165 --> 00:12:27.490\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, and that's what,\nin the eyes of color theory, that's\n\n226\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.960\nthe definition of those particular terms,\nand I threw in a couple more, down here.\n\n227\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.280\nYou've got the chroma, saturation,\nvalue, purity, brightness, lightness.\n\n228\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.450\nYou go to five different websites,\n\n229\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.990\nthey're probably gonna say\nfive different definitions.\n\n230\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.850\nAnd then the levels of brightness and\nlightness.\n\n231\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.429\nBut you can look these up and\nlook at them in different ways.\n\n232\n00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:54.380\nBut the saturation, if it's a saturated\ncolor, it's really bright or vibrant.\n\n233\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.130\nBut then somebody might\ncall that a brightness.\n\n234\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.530\nI think it's all of how\nwe determine what that\n\n235\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.000\nword is when we use it in regular talk.\n\n236\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.071\nBut when you're talking about\nit from a theory point,\n\n237\n00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:10.563\nit does have more definitive definitions\nand they're all a little different.\n\n238\n00:13:10.563 --> 00:13:12.560\nYeah, it's the same but\ndifferent, my favorite saying.\n\n239\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.860\n>> Yeah, same but different.\n\n240\n00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.400\nContext is always important, right,\n\n241\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.418\nhow we're using that term in relation\nto whatever we're talking about.\n\n242\n00:13:18.418 --> 00:13:23.780\n>> And that kinda goes right into,\nthen what are these colors saying to us?\n\n243\n00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.830\nWhy would we not paint\na hospital room red?\n\n244\n00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.130\n>> Because red makes you feel,\nI don't know, it makes me feel angry or\n\n245\n00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:38.260\nexcited, or-\n>> Fire, danger.\n\n246\n00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.854\nWhy is a stop sign red?\n\n247\n00:13:39.854 --> 00:13:43.555\nIt's to say stop,\nyou need to not to go forward anymore,\n\n248\n00:13:43.555 --> 00:13:46.884\nbecause there's danger\nahead if you don't stop.\n\n249\n00:13:46.884 --> 00:13:49.986\nIt means a lot of different things, but\n\n250\n00:13:49.986 --> 00:13:54.610\nthat's those general,\nwhat does this color say to us?\n\n251\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.012\nThat's what we're kinda gonna do,\nso let's keep on going.\n\n252\n00:13:57.012 --> 00:13:57.810\nLet's play this game.\n\n253\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.061\nWhat do you think of\nwhen we think of green?\n\n254\n00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:02.740\n>> Green, I think money.\n\n255\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.150\n>> Yeah.\n>> Grass.\n\n256\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.544\n>> Grass, yes.\n\n257\n00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:07.050\nI have some notes over here.\n\n258\n00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.250\nNew beginnings.\n\n259\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.630\n>> New beginnings, right.\n\n260\n00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.300\n>> Nature.\n\n261\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.640\n>> Growth, yeah, absolutely.\n\n262\n00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.330\n>> Growth, wealth.\n\n263\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.910\n>> Springtime, I can see that.\n\n264\n00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.610\n>> What about purple?\n\n265\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.003\n>> Purple, I think of royalty.\n\n266\n00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:20.559\n>> Mm-hm, that's another one.\n\n267\n00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:22.840\nThey also talk about wealth.\n\n268\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.670\nRoyalty is definitely the first one\nthat is on a lot of people's list,\n\n269\n00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.440\nwhen we talk about that.\n\n270\n00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.679\nYes, so point one for you.\n\n271\n00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:31.683\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What about brown?\n\n272\n00:14:31.683 --> 00:14:34.013\n>> Hm, dirt, earthy.\n\n273\n00:14:34.013 --> 00:14:35.058\n>> Mm-hm, nature.\n\n274\n00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:35.995\n>> Nature, yeah.\n\n275\n00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:37.397\n>> Nature, what about white?\n\n276\n00:14:37.397 --> 00:14:44.780\n>> Clean, crisp, almost like sanitary,\nI don't know a good way to say it.\n\n277\n00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.706\n>> Pure.\n>> Pure, yes.\n\n278\n00:14:45.706 --> 00:14:48.170\n>> Pure and clean, yeah.\n\n279\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.954\nAnd you can go for hours talking\nabout what every color means and\n\n280\n00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:56.239\nwhy you would want to pick one versus\nthe other, but I just figured it'd\n\n281\n00:14:56.239 --> 00:15:01.050\nbe kinda fun to talk about color and what\nwe mean when we use it in certain places.\n\n282\n00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.652\n>> And I know, sometimes those meanings,\nit's a cultural thing too,\n\n283\n00:15:04.652 --> 00:15:08.752\nwhere white in our culture might mean\nsomething slightly different in another\n\n284\n00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:09.875\nculture\n>> Yes, and\n\n285\n00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.224\nnow we're getting really deep, aren't we?\n\n286\n00:15:11.224 --> 00:15:12.989\n>> Yes, we'll go back, we digress.\n\n287\n00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:17.917\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, just keep it on the\nsurface, but yes, that is completely true\n\n288\n00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:23.415\nand it's one of those things of why whole\nbooks are written on this specific topic.\n\n289\n00:15:23.415 --> 00:15:24.025\n>> Very good.\n>> So\n\n290\n00:15:24.025 --> 00:15:29.568\nwe've kinda covered what the colors mean\nand the way that they can work together.\n\n291\n00:15:29.568 --> 00:15:34.168\nBut when we're talking about color in\nrelationship to what we're doing in\n\n292\n00:15:34.168 --> 00:15:38.768\ncreating graphics and design and\nusing them in Illustrator or Photoshop or\n\n293\n00:15:38.768 --> 00:15:43.340\nInDesign or any product,\nwe really start talking about the numbers.\n\n294\n00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:48.560\nBecause then we get into the scientific of\nwell, what is the value of this color, not\n\n295\n00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.350\njust value of what it means on the wall or\nto culture, but what are the numbers?\n\n296\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:58.733\nWhat does it mean to be 52, 175, and 25?\n\n297\n00:15:58.733 --> 00:16:00.103\nWhat does that mean?\n\n298\n00:16:00.103 --> 00:16:01.473\nWhat's 172c?\n\n299\n00:16:01.473 --> 00:16:02.657\nWhat is that?\n\n300\n00:16:02.657 --> 00:16:06.332\nIn the next episodes, we'll get into\nthe difference between our web colors,\n\n301\n00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:10.500\nour print colors and what all those\nnumbers mean when we make our graphics.\n\n302\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.310\n>> All right, Vonne, great stuff there.\n\n303\n00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.920\nFascinating information, thank you for\nthat and those great

--> 00:16:20.958\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n307\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.685\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n308\n00:16:22.685 --> 00:16:23.185\n>> Got staticky.\n\n309\n00:16:24.346 --> 00:16:25.565\n>> Yeah?\n\n310\n00:16:25.565 --> 00:16:27.340\nAll right, one more time.\n\n311\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.300\n>> I'm just having all sorts of\ntechnical problems, aren't I?\n\n312\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.749\nMaking your life hell.\n\n313\n00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:36.225\n>> No, that was, honestly, that was\none of the best episodes [CROSSTALK].\n\n314\n00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:39.290\n>> Yeah, poor Titus has to edit all this.\n\n315\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.684\n>> [INAUDIBLE] jump again.\n\n316\n00:16:40.684 --> 00:16:41.914\n>> Me?\n\n317\n00:16:41.914 --> 00:16:45.327\n>> [INAUDIBLE] man, I don't know.\n\n318\n00:16:45.327 --> 00:16:46.195\n>> Okay, we just won't move.\n\n319\n00:16:46.195 --> 00:16:48.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n320\n00:16:48.340

00:00:18.860\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC2015.\n\n4\n00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.450\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at color values.\n\n5\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.790\nIn a previous episode, we spent a lot\nof time going over color theory.\n\n6\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.150\nBut at some point we gotta take\nthat theory, right, and put it into\n\n7\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.670\npractical use, actually get the colors\nthat we want into our application.\n\n8\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.470\nAnd that can be a tricky process\nbecause there's many different ways and\n\n9\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.810\nmethods that we can use.\n\n10\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.960\nAnd here to explain all\nthat is Miss Vaughn Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.680\nHow's it going, Vaughn?\n\n12\n00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.200\n>> Great, I'm glad to be here to\ntalk to you all about color and\n\n13\n00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.800\nall of the fancy numbers that go\nalong with working with numbers.\n\n14\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.961\nAnd we're gonna understand what it means\nto be talking about 122550 versus 52%,\n\n15\n00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:02.619\nall sorts of fun numbers, so\nwe're going to get into that.\n\n16\n00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:03.804\n>> Is math involved?\n\n17\n00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:05.862\n>> There actually will be math.\n\n18\n00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:06.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n19\n00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.062\nit's good because you're here to help us,\nso.\n\n20\n00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:09.574\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:12.048\n>> So, hopefully together we'll be able to\n\n22\n00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:13.107\nadd up to five, or\n\n23\n00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:14.723\nsomething close to that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:15.916\n>> Sounds like\n\n25\n00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:17.094\na plan.\n[LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.440\n>> All right, so I've got my document\n\n27\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.940\nhere, ready to go for us to start\nthe lecture about color values.\n\n28\n00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.750\nBecause, like Mike said, we were talking\nabout, what does it mean to be red, and\n\n29\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.530\nis that a warm color,\ndo we have analogous colors, but\n\n30\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.310\nthat's fine as the actual look and\nthe aesthetics of a design.\n\n31\n00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.880\nBut understanding what that\nnumber means is very important.\n\n32\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.270\nAnd are we designing an ad that's\ngoing to go into a website?\n\n33\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.040\nAre we designing an ad that's going\ninto a commercial-printed brochure,\n\n34\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.400\nor magazine, something like that.\n\n35\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.240\nSo it's very important to understand\nthe differentiation between that.\n\n36\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.520\nSo here we have The whole\nweb versus print or\n\n37\n00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.820\nyou can also just say screen because when\nI just talk about web, you could do video.\n\n38\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.310\nAnything is gonna displayed on\nan actual monitor of some sort.\n\n39\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.400\nSo that's where we get in to\nwhether we are RGB for screen or\n\n40\n00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.240\nweb, or your print, which is CMYK,\nand what that stands for.\n\n41\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.120\nBut we'll get into all of\nthat throughout this lecture.\n\n42\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.640\nI just wanna give a quick overview,\n\n43\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.480\nbecause this orange right here,\nyou think it's just orange, right?\n\n44\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.240\nWell, the value of what that orange is\nin In our programs is different for\n\n45\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.910\nweb, for CMYK, for print, for spot colors.\n\n46\n00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.180\nOr for what else is on here?\n\n47\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.970\nOur hex numbers.\n\n48\n00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.640\nOkay.\n\n49\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.650\nSo this means something\nin different places.\n\n50\n00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.830\nAnd it's important to understand\nthe differentiation between it.\n\n51\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.590\nBecause if I'm working for a company and\nI'm doing some freelance work and\n\n52\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.950\nI need to make sure that I am using\nthe University of Florida orange.\n\n53\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.960\nI have to make sure that I\nunderstand that that is 0, 87, 100,\n\n54\n00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.800\n0 when I'm sending that to\na commercial printer or\n\n55\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.670\nthat that is spot color 172.\n\n56\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.890\nBecause God forbid,\nif you do not use Gator orange and\n\n57\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.870\nyou use Tennessee orange in a brochure.\n\n58\n00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.359\nThat's not going to fly.\n>> That's the end of your job with\n\n59\n00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.344\nthe University of Florida probably.\n\n60\n00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:21.552\n[LAUGH]\n>> Pretty much yeah so\n\n61\n00:03:21.552 --> 00:03:25.190\nthat's why having the companies.\n\n62\n00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.880\nCompanies spend a lot\nof time branding their.\n\n63\n00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.228\nTheir color and their look and you need\nto understand what those numbers mean.\n\n64\n00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:37.310\n>> Right.\n>> So let's go with web first.\n\n65\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.300\nWe'll start with web.\n\n66\n00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.960\nAll right.\nSo\n\n67\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.020\nhere's my hand out if you want to say or\nmy slide for web.\n\n68\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.120\nWeb, we would go with RGB,\nred, green and blue.\n\n69\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.380\nWe're talking about light.\n\n70\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.160\nWe're talking about how light actually\nadd together to make different colors,\n\n71\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.770\nand it almost goes against what you would\nnormally think as we were talking about\n\n72\n00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.745\nwhat red and blue make, well purple.\n\n73\n00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:04.550\n[LAUGH] I was going with blue and yellow.\n\n74\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.740\nBlue and yellow make green and\nthat whole thing.\n\n75\n00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.450\nSo here, it throws us off a little bit\nbecause you're saying, s o red and\n\n76\n00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.100\ngreen make yellow, or green and\nblue, or red and blue make purple.\n\n77\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.860\nLike, that's fine, but\nit's that red and green make yellow.\n\n78\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.470\nIt kinda throws us off, cuz our primary\ncolors we're used to dealing with, red,\n\n79\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.140\nyellow and blue, and\nhere we're using red, blue and green.\n\n80\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.930\nBut remember, we're not talking\nabout color in the way that we\n\n81\n00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.640\nthink of color like crayons or with paint\nor something we're talking about light.\n\n82\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.170\nAnd when we're talking\nabout the light measurement\n\n83\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.260\nwe're talking in a 0 to 255 scale.\n\n84\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.120\nAnd I threw another thing in here,\nwe'll talk a little bit about more,\n\n85\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.900\nbut the A is alpha.\n\n86\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.280\nThe only reason I wanted to kind of put\nthat in is because when we start talking\n\n87\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.740\nabout web values in use of coding for\n\n88\n00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.460\nyour HTML code, the alpha does come\ninto play in some of those measurements.\n\n89\n00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.990\nSo, alpha here means opacity,\nthe see-throughness of a color.\n\n90\n00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.830\nSo, just throwing out there, cuz you're\nprobably looking at it and saying,\n\n91\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.858\nwhy haven't you addressed that yet.\n\n92\n00:05:06.858 --> 00:05:12.770\nSo, [LAUGH] on the 0 to 255 scale, you\ncould see, this purple color right here,\n\n93\n00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.540\nif I were to creat that in\nan RGB color mode would be 155.\n\n94\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.140\nSo there's a decent amount of red,\nthere's not so\n\n95\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.600\nmuch green, okay, and\nthere's a lot more blue.\n\n96\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.100\nSo this would be the RGB value for\nthis particular purple.\n\n97\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.850\nOkay, but and if they mix all together\nyou're actually making white.\n\n98\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.010\nSo all on you kind of think\nabout like lights right.\n\n99\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.900\nIf the lights are on then they're on,\nyou can see.\n\n100\n00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.990\nIf the lights are off then it's dark and\nit's black and you can't see.\n\n101\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.236\nSo you have to think of it that\nway of like all the way on or\n\n102\n00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:52.151\nall the way off 0 off 255 on.\n\n103\n00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:57.770\n>> So all three values where 255\n255 255 that's when you get white.\n\n104\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.380\nAll of them are zero, zero,\nzero, we'd have black.\n\n105\n00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.070\n>> Correct.\n\n106\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.660\nAnd that's where we're gonna play\na little game if you wanna say,\n\n107\n00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.080\nof like guess the color value\n>> Aah.\n\n108\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.350\n>> Based on what we've just said.\n\n109\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.840\nAnd we were just talking about\nthe first two, that zero, zero, zero,\n\n110\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.180\nversus 255,255,255 is the black and white.\n\n111\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.810\nI think I mixed those up, but\n\n112\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.470\nyou can see it on the screen here as\n000 is black and the white is the 255.\n\n113\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.550\nSo if we were going to give\nthe RGB color value for red,\n\n114\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.640\nwhat do you think that would be?\n\n115\n00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.210\n>> Well let's see.\n\n116\n00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.970\nI'd want a load of red its max value,\nso that's 255, and then.\n\n117\n00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.370\nI've got my red, so\nI don't need any green or blue.\n\n118\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.510\nSo I'm going to put those to zero.\n\n119\n00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.230\n>> You got it right.\n\n120\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.848\n>> Woo hoo!\n\n121\n00:06:43.848 --> 00:06:46.560\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You win nothing.\n\n122\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.800\nSo I think you can get the idea here is,\n\n123\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.670\nlike, this is red as\nthe reddest it can be.\n\n124\n00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.570\n>> So it's all the way up on the red,\n\n125\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.800\nall the way down on the other ones like\nyour cyan, so the green would be what?\n\n126\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.000\n>> Zero, 255, zero\n>> Mm-hm, and\n\n127\n00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.360\nthen what about this super blue?\n\n128\n00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.962\n>> zero, zero, 255\n>> Mm-hm,\n\n129\n00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:07.002\nyes\n>> All right, so\n\n130\n00:07:07.002 --> 00:07:08.850\nlet's move over to the right.\n\n131\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:09.545\nSo, yellow.\n\n132\n00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:10.568\n>> Nope, I'm done.\n\n133\n00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:12.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n134\n00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.310\nOkay, now we're getting too complicated,\nright?\n\n135\n00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.540\nOkay, here.\n\n136\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.175\nLet me give you a little hint.\n\n137\n00:07:18.175 --> 00:07:19.116\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n138\n00:07:19.116 --> 00:07:21.486\n>> If we were going to do yellow in our\n\n139\n00:07:21.486 --> 00:07:26.640\nRGB color value, we would have-\n>> 255 for the red,\n\n140\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.778\n255 for the green, and 0 for the blue.\n\n141\n00:07:28.778 --> 00:07:33.490\nYep, yeah, and\nthat was the one that always threw me off,\n\n142\n00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.040\nwas trying the yellows and the oranges.\n\n143\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.970\nAll right, so\nhow are we gonna go with that?\n\n144\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.060\nThis one's a little harder, but\nwhat value's gonna be the lowest?\n\n145\n00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.410\n>> Blue?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n146\n00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.270\nAnd then you know the other\nones are gotta be higher.\n\n147\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.980\n>> Right.\n>> But orange has more red than yellow.\n\n148\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.315\nBut then it's like wait,\nwe're talking about green.\n\n149\n00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:54.425\nSo let's just,\nlet's just look at that one.\n\n150\n00:07:54.425 --> 00:07:55.302\nSo there you go.\n\n151\n00:07:55.302 --> 00:07:55.972\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n152\n00:07:55.972 --> 00:07:58.796\n>> So it's a lot of red,\nnot as much green.\n\n153\n00:07:58.796 --> 00:08:01.700\nSo that way you can see\nthat between yellow and\n\n154\n00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.230\norange we've got more red than green.\n\n155\n00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.630\nSo the sky blue, any guess on that?\n\n156\n00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.095\nOr we can just go low high,\nhow about that?\n\n157\n00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:16.851\n>> Yeah, with sky blue, do we just lower\nthe blue and leave the other two at zero?\n\n158\n00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:17.895\nOr no, we have to throw a little green in.\n\n159\n00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:21.053\n>> Yeah,\nyeah remember our little diagram up here.\n\n160\n00:08:21.053 --> 00:08:26.943\nYeah, so looking at our diagram,\nif that's how we can get this sky blue,\n\n161\n00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:30.306\nhow are we gonna get that fuchsia?\n\n162\n00:08:30.306 --> 00:08:34.749\n>> I think we're gonna take that blue and\nadd just a little bit of red to it.\n\n163\n00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:35.572\n>> Yeah, actually, a lot of red.\n\n164\n00:08:35.572 --> 00:08:36.293\n>> A lot of red.\n\n165\n00:08:36.293 --> 00:08:40.647\n>> [LAUGH] Because it's a really vibrant,\nor saturated, however you want, whatever\n\n166\n00:08:40.647 --> 00:08:45.330\nvocabulary words you wanna use to describe\nit, that's like pink, like hot pink.\n\n167\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.613\nIf it was a lighter pink,\nif it was like a super light pink,\n\n168\n00:08:48.613 --> 00:08:52.372\nthen all of that red and blue value,\nthose would be closer to zero.\n\n169\n00:08:52.372 --> 00:08:56.915\nOr actually, well yeah,\nthey would be lower okay, so,\n\n170\n00:08:56.915 --> 00:09:02.229\nthe darker the color the lower,\nthe lighter the color the higher.\n\n171\n00:09:02.229 --> 00:09:04.447\nSo yeah, I just kind of threw myself off.\n\n172\n00:09:04.447 --> 00:09:06.049\nBut anyways that's what you got going on.\n\n173\n00:09:06.049 --> 00:09:10.289\nThe nice thing is, is we don't have to\nnecessarily play this guessing game when\n\n174\n00:09:10.289 --> 00:09:12.710\nwe are like, well I want that color.\n\n175\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.327\nIllustrator will tell us how these numbers\ncome out so we're okay there [LAUGH].\n\n176\n00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:18.534\n>> Thank goodness.\n>> Yes, right.\n\n177\n00:09:18.534 --> 00:09:24.440\nSo it's really more of a understanding,\nthe concept of what it means to be RGB.\n\n178\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.956\nAnd then down here,\n\n179\n00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:31.138\nI have a little diagram about\nthe alpha being from a 0% to 100%.\n\n180\n00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:36.861\n100% alpha or opacity,\nmeans it's not see-through.\n\n181\n00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:42.318\nThe opacity is It's 100%,\nit's not see through.\n\n182\n00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:45.362\nLet's just kinda go with that,\nbecause yeah, the opaque,\n\n183\n00:09:45.362 --> 00:09:47.461\nlet's keep those words out of the world.\n\n184\n00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:49.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna go with an alpha of zero,\n\n185\n00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.970\nmeans it's completely see through.\n\n186\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.630\nSo that's the transparency,\nyou can see right through it.\n\n187\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.637\nSo now why would this be important?\n\n188\n00:09:56.637 --> 00:10:01.009\nIf you were doing any type of image or\ncolor that you want it to\n\n189\n00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:05.825\nbe able to see through something else,\nyou want to see behind it.\n\n190\n00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:09.697\nThat's where you'd want your alpha to be\nin a different percentage rather then\n\n191\n00:10:09.697 --> 00:10:12.434\nyou can't see through it or\nyou can see through it, so.\n\n192\n00:10:12.434 --> 00:10:15.230\n>> So\nit gives us that transparency we can use.\n\n193\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.200\n>> Yes, and again,\n\n194\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.120\nthat's where it comes into play when we\nget into web coding in just a little bit.\n\n195\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.029\nAll right, so let's move onto another\n\n196\n00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:28.655\nway that you can use numbers for\ncolors in web.\n\n197\n00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:31.950\nWe're gonna talk about hexadecimal.\n\n198\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.380\nSo hexadecimal is just\nanother way to count.\n\n199\n00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.460\nAnd this should probably\nbe a favorite section for\n\n200\n00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.800\nyou because hexadecimal is probably\na term that you know a little bit about.\n\n201\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.380\n>> We do use it in the computer world.\n\n202\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.920\nA lot of our addresses,\nlarge binary numbers,\n\n203\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.350\nare converted into hexidecimal,\ncuz it's a base 16 numbering system, so\n\n204\n00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.280\nwe can take that large binary number and\nwrite fewer characters.\n\n205\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.769\n>> I'm not exactly sure what you\njust said, [LAUGH] but binary, what?\n\n206\n00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:01.687\nWell I know a little bit about it,\nbut yes,\n\n207\n00:11:01.687 --> 00:11:05.590\nit kinda just gets down into ones and\nzeroes, isn't it?\n\n208\n00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.514\nIt's all about bits and\nbytes and how it works, and\n\n209\n00:11:08.514 --> 00:11:11.032\nwhat it would use an IP\naddress subnetting.\n\n210\n00:11:11.032 --> 00:11:12.552\n>> Yes.\n>> Remember all of that,\n\n211\n00:11:12.552 --> 00:11:14.732\nI wouldn't know how to do it anymore, but\n\n212\n00:11:14.732 --> 00:11:17.320\n[LAUGH] I remember when we had to do that,\nyeah.\n\n213\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.350\nSo, when I have the decimal numbers,\nthis is where you're going to really,\n\n214\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:27.650\nyou're going to be using hexadecimal\nnumbering in code for HTML.\n\n215\n00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.450\nYou will use the hex number for\n\n216\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:36.020\na specific color rather than its RGB\nvalue if you're doing straight HTML.\n\n217\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.530\nNow with CSS cascading style sheets,\nthen it gets into where you can use\n\n218\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.460\na couple of different types of numerical\nsystems that are available to you.\n\n219\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.148\nBut back in the old days,\nif you want to say,\n\n220\n00:11:48.148 --> 00:11:50.564\ndecimal hex numbers were the way to go.\n\n221\n00:11:50.564 --> 00:11:54.523\nAnd so zero to nine, A to F, so A is?\n\n222\n00:11:54.523 --> 00:11:55.185\n>> A ten.\n\n223\n00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:56.439\n>> And then 11.\n\n224\n00:11:56.439 --> 00:11:59.922\n>> On up, B is 11,\nC cuz you have, it's yeah.\n\n225\n00:11:59.922 --> 00:12:05.077\nAnd C would be 12, D would be 13,\nE is 14, and F is 15.\n\n226\n00:12:05.077 --> 00:12:07.620\n>> Yes, so, that's where we go.\n\n227\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:13.645\nKind of back to the 0 is off and\n255 is on, it's like 0 is off,\n\n228\n00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:18.420\nhere an F is fully on in this\nparticular numbering system.\n\n229\n00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.697\nSo each, sorry,\n\n230\n00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:24.481\nwhen you're doing hexidecimal\nnumbers it's looking like this.\n\n231\n00:12:24.481 --> 00:12:27.639\nYou can see that it's an actual\nsix numbers, so that's your hex.\n\n232\n00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:30.277\nAnd the first two values\nrepresent your red,\n\n233\n00:12:30.277 --> 00:12:34.105\nyour second two are your green,\nand your third two are your blue.\n\n234\n00:12:34.105 --> 00:12:35.820\nSo that's how you go with it.\n\n235\n00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.200\nNow, this particular number here,\nthis hex number,\n\n236\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.375\nwould be representing this\nparticular aqua color.\n\n237\n00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:47.330\nOkay, so you can see there's a lot\nof Es and that's kinda high,\n\n238\n00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.050\nand how they work together.\n\n239\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.700\nI just know that that's sky blue\nbecause it's telling me, but\n\n240\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:59.560\njust know that where the numbers\nrepresent the R, the G, and the B.\n\n241\n00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:05.404\nNow you also can get into certain\nhexadecimal numbers that look like this,\n\n242\n00:13:05.404 --> 00:13:08.651\nwhere you have the same value repeated for\n\n243\n00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:12.470\neach one of the R, G, and\nB sets if you wanna say.\n\n244\n00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.915\nWhen you get into the doubling\nof your numbers, this, well,\n\n245\n00:13:16.915 --> 00:13:22.160\nin certain numbers, it would be\nknown as having a websafe value.\n\n246\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.969\nWebsafe values are 0, 3, 6, 9, C, and F.\n\n247\n00:13:24.969 --> 00:13:27.740\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n248\n00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.971\nWell, back in the day,\nview could only represent\n\n249\n00:13:31.971 --> 00:13:36.119\na certain amount of colors on a monitor,\nright?\n\n250\n00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:39.776\nThis is kinda going back to the RCT,\nright?\n\n251\n00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:40.659\n>> Yes, the CRTs.\n\n252\n00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:42.238\n>> CRT, okay, yes, CRT.\n\n253\n00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.607\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In that it could only do the,\n\n254\n00:13:44.607 --> 00:13:45.999\nwhat was it, 256 colors?\n\n255\n00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:46.742\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n256\n00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:48.507\n>> So that was the only\nthing that you could have.\n\n257\n00:13:48.507 --> 00:13:53.941\nSo you could only actually show 256\ndifferent colors on that old 8 bit system,\n\n258\n00:13:53.941 --> 00:13:55.426\nor-\n>> 256 would be 8 bit, correct.\n\n259\n00:13:55.426 --> 00:13:56.263\n>> Okay, good.\n\n260\n00:13:56.263 --> 00:13:59.780\nThat's why I have my tech\nguy here to check my facts.\n\n261\n00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:04.490\nSo you had 256 colors that could be shown.\n\n262\n00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:09.331\nWell, in web-safe there's\nactually only 216.\n\n263\n00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:10.527\nThere's 216 web-safe colors.\n\n264\n00:14:10.527 --> 00:14:11.990\nNow why is that?\n\n265\n00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.929\nCuz we just said it was 256.\n\n266\n00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:18.294\nWell, 216 was the difference\nbetween your Apple\n\n267\n00:14:18.294 --> 00:14:22.868\noperating system and\nyour Windows operating system.\n\n268\n00:14:22.868 --> 00:14:27.291\nThe way that they determined colors were\ndifferent in those two operating systems.\n\n269\n00:14:27.291 --> 00:14:32.684\nAnd so the ones that actually overlapped\nor that would be able to be represented\n\n270\n00:14:32.684 --> 00:14:38.089\non both a Apple operating system and\na Windows operating system, was 216.\n\n271\n00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:41.212\nAnd that's what it means to be web-safe,\n\n272\n00:14:41.212 --> 00:14:47.460\nyou're only using colors that would be\nsafely represented on older systems.\n\n273\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.635\nNow, older systems, we're way beyond\nwhere we were 10, 15 years ago,\n\n274\n00:14:52.635 --> 00:14:56.400\nor whenever this was kind of like a real\nthing that you had to worry about,\n\n275\n00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.790\nwhen you were a web designer.\n\n276\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.020\nYou had to be this way.\n\n277\n00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.400\nNow, that is so far gone,\nyou really don't have to watch it.\n\n278\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.620\nBut it does come up, and you will\nsee it in a lot of the applications,\n\n279\n00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.370\nwhere you can check the box off, and\nwe get into the colors, and the swatches.\n\n280\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.670\nYou can check a little box off that says,\nonly display web-safe colors.\n\n281\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:21.100\nAnd you will only be able to choose\ncolors that will be considered web-safe.\n\n282\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.700\nSo, a little older, but\n\n283\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.823\nstill very relevant in the sense of how\napplications show you what's going on.\n\n284\n00:15:27.823 --> 00:15:32.092\nSo when you have the six values for\nyour web-safe colors for the doubling,\n\n285\n00:15:32.092 --> 00:15:33.800\nyou can also shorthand this.\n\n286\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.258\nYou could go ahead and\nput it into three numbers,\n\n287\n00:15:38.258 --> 00:15:43.817\nbecause if you have F0F,\nit just knows that it is FF00FF.\n\n288\n00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:46.458\nSo it's just-\n>> With web-safe, they're always gonna be\n\n289\n00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:49.320\ndoubled, it's never gonna be a FE\n>> It's always gonna be two Fs.\n\n290\n00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.742\nSo you can put one F.\n\n291\n00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.380\nSo it doesn't seem like it\nsaves you a lot of typing, but\n\n292\n00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.104\nI can imagine with thousands of lines of\ncode, that could really help you out.\n\n293\n00:15:57.104 --> 00:15:57.754\n>> Yes.\n\n294\n00:15:57.754 --> 00:16:03.490\nAnd just to kind of go off of that\nshort handing of the hexidecimal value,\n\n295\n00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:08.380\nI was kind of dovetailing it on\nto the WEBSAFE with the 0, 3,\n\n296\n00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.630\n6, 9, C and F cuz that's the only numbers.\n\n297\n00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:17.710\nIn a hexidecimal notation, that would be\nconsidered web-safe, as the double values.\n\n298\n00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.470\nBut, you can have 44ee22,\n\n299\n00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.513\nI mean you can have double values.\n\n300\n00:16:25.513 --> 00:16:26.384\n>> That are web safe.\n\n301\n00:16:26.384 --> 00:16:29.102\n>> Yes, they are websafe that\nyou can shorthand them that way.\n\n302\n00:16:29.102 --> 00:16:32.978\nSo you can do for example E F and\ntwo whatever combination I tried to\n\n303\n00:16:32.978 --> 00:16:36.575\ndemonstrate there [LAUGH] so\nyou can shorthand it there it just\n\n304\n00:16:36.575 --> 00:16:41.750\nmeans that it will be doubled for the\nvalues so it doesn't have to be websafe.\n\n305\n00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.930\nSo kinda going down here, if we've got,\n\n306\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.440\nwe said that zero is off and\nF is all the way on.\n\n307\n00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.750\nKinda the same game that we were\nplaying back before, with the RGB.\n\n308\n00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.970\n>> I knew I should have taken notes.\n\n309\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.757\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n310\n00:16:57.757 --> 00:17:01.839\n[LAUGH] It's still in\nthe additive color mode that RGB,\n\n311\n00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:05.130\ncuz we're still talking about light here.\n\n312\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.530\nWe're talking about display.\n\n313\n00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.840\nSo all on would be white,\nso what would white be?\n\n314\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.895\n>> FFF or FFFFFF.\n\n315\n00:17:14.895 --> 00:17:18.170\n>> Yes you are correct and I just\nrealized that, why is it not talking?\n\n316\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.010\nThere we go.\n\n317\n00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.320\nI'm playing around with my layers to be,\nare hiding and everything, and\n\n318\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.770\nI forgot that my group eyeball, the group\nvisibility wasn't on, so that way,\n\n319\n00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.700\nI couldn't toggle the actual\nindividual parts.\n\n320\n00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.960\nSo F, yes, and\nI did it in the six number notation.\n\n321\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.456\nSo black would be what?\n\n322\n00:17:35.456 --> 00:17:37.910\n>> 000000?\n\n323\n00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.970\n>> Yes, with [INAUDIBLE] one, two, three.\n\n324\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.064\nYeah, I do six of them.\n\n325\n00:17:41.064 --> 00:17:42.810\n[LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE] six zeroes.\n\n326\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.330\n>> Correct, yes.\n\n327\n00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:50.730\nSo back over to the red, green and\nblues, where we're gonna go?\n\n328\n00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:56.290\nWe're gonna go with with red being?\n\n329\n00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.530\n>> FF0000.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n330\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:58.415\n>> Green would be 00FF00.\n\n331\n00:17:58.415 --> 00:17:59.089\nMm-hm.\n\n332\n00:17:59.089 --> 00:18:01.642\n>> And then blue would be 0000FF.\n\n333\n00:18:01.642 --> 00:18:02.689\n>> Good, yes.\n\n334\n00:18:02.689 --> 00:18:03.665\n>> Got those down pat.\n\n335\n00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:04.185\n>> All right.\n\n336\n00:18:04.185 --> 00:18:05.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n337\n00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.034\n>> So back from our yellow is really green\n\n338\n00:18:08.034 --> 00:18:12.010\nand red combined,\nwhat would our yellow value be?\n\n339\n00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.250\n>> Green and red, so\nwe'll turn on the red FF,\n\n340\n00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.385\nwe'll turn on the green FF and\nwe'll leave the blue off, 00.\n\n341\n00:18:18.385 --> 00:18:19.705\n>> Yes.\n\n342\n00:18:19.705 --> 00:18:21.987\n[LAUGH] Good job.\n\n343\n00:18:21.987 --> 00:18:25.528\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so let's go on to,\n\n344\n00:18:25.528 --> 00:18:30.250\norange is always a little tougher, but we\nknow that that's gonna be a lot of what?\n\n345\n00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.552\n>> A lot of reds and a lot of blues?\n\n346\n00:18:36.097 --> 00:18:36.734\n>> No.\n\n347\n00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:37.809\n[LAUGH]\n>> A lot of green?\n\n348\n00:18:37.809 --> 00:18:40.131\n>> Green, but not as much green.\n\n349\n00:18:40.131 --> 00:18:41.041\n>> But not as much green?\n\n350\n00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:41.777\n>> Yes, and a lot more red.\n\n351\n00:18:41.777 --> 00:18:46.970\n>> So then we could do FF and\nthen about halfway through it'd be 7700.\n\n352\n00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.940\n>> Yeah, close, yeah, so, well,\n\n353\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.600\nat least in this particular shade that\nI was creating from, it is FF7300.\n\n354\n00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.188\nBut yes, you're close enough so.\n\n355\n00:18:56.188 --> 00:19:00.110\n[LAUGH] And since you've done so\nwell, I'll give you the last two.\n\n356\n00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.760\n>> Okay.\n>> So we'll just go with, all right, so\n\n357\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.380\nwe know that sky blue is gonna be\na lot of the red and the blue.\n\n358\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.740\nAnd then the pink is going to be\na lot of the red and the blue.\n\n359\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.410\nAnd I think I just messed the sky,\nit's actually a lot of green.\n\n360\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.490\nAgain, I'm so glad that our Adobe products\nare going to give us the numbers for us.\n\n361\n00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.947\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n362\n00:19:18.947 --> 00:19:20.604\n>> So we don't have to keep guessing.\n\n363\n00:19:20.604 --> 00:19:21.386\nSo all right, wonderful.\n\n364\n00:19:21.386 --> 00:19:27.878\nAll right, so let's move on to another way\nthat you can actually notate values for\n\n365\n00:19:27.878 --> 00:19:32.691\nscreen display, and\nthat's a little known one called HSB.\n\n366\n00:19:32.691 --> 00:19:35.650\nThis is hue, saturation and brightness.\n\n367\n00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.010\nNow I will tell you right from the start,\nthat I don't really measure colors for\n\n368\n00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.920\nweb in HSB.\n\n369\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.930\nOr there's HSL, cuz you can see there,\nI got B, V versus L.\n\n370\n00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.890\nBut really, boils down to,\n\n371\n00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.510\nthey're all different\nrepresentations of RGB values, okay?\n\n372\n00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:57.510\nAnd you will see HSB values\ndisplayed when you're\n\n373\n00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.370\npicking colors in the color picker\nin all of your Adobe products, so\n\n374\n00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.870\nat least it's good to understand what\nthe letters even stand for, okay?\n\n375\n00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.250\nAnd it goes on this degree,\n\n376\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:12.620\nthis color wheel form 0 to 360 if you\nthink about a circle being 360 degrees.\n\n377\n00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:18.630\nAnd where the hue falls within that\ncircular spectrum if you want to say.\n\n378\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:24.170\nThen how much light and dark, the\nsaturation and the brightness would be.\n\n379\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.350\nAnd so they represent this\nin this little graphic here.\n\n380\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.770\nIt's not to scale,\nit's just trying to show you something.\n\n381\n00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.100\nSo just to give you some\nexamples down here.\n\n382\n00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.110\nThese are all HSB values.\n\n383\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.810\nAs you could see that\n00100 like the brightness,\n\n384\n00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.110\nwe're talking about light again.\n\n385\n00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.630\nIt's very bright, so all the bright is on.\n\n386\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.250\nBut then when you look at black you\ncan see the saturation is 100 and\n\n387\n00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.230\nthe brightness is at zero.\n\n388\n00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:56.276\nSo it's like the S is the black and\nthe B is like the light, kind of.\n\n389\n00:20:56.276 --> 00:20:59.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] In it's weird way,\n\n390\n00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.850\nso and then you can see red,\ngreen and blue.\n\n391\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.667\nYou can see that the hue is a different\ndegree along that 360 degree.\n\n392\n00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:12.068\nLike the color wheel that we were talking\nabout when we were doing color theory,\n\n393\n00:21:12.068 --> 00:21:14.340\nwhen we had all of those\nvalues going around.\n\n394\n00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:20.080\nYou can think of it that way, of where\nis that color within that hue spectrum,\n\n395\n00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.270\nif you wanna say, and I've even seen,\nyou can see that this,\n\n396\n00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:28.830\nif you're saturation brightness is on,\nat 100 percent on a lot of them or,\n\n397\n00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.960\nthe hue value actually is,\nthis could be 0 or 360,\n\n398\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.560\ncuz 0 and 360 are the same, and\nif you have the whole saturation up.\n\n399\n00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.680\nIt doesn't matter what the hue value is,\nit could be 0 or 200 or a 120.\n\n400\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.630\nIf the saturation is\nall the way up to 100,\n\n401\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.530\nit's gonna be black no matter what it is.\n\n402\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.460\nSo it's kind of a weird, I think it's\na little bit of a weird measurement system\n\n403\n00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.690\nbut it is something to at least see.\n\n404\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.430\n>> Definitely different, but I'm sure\nit has it's application somewhere.\n\n405\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.700\n>> Yeah and I mean it just goes along with\nthe, it's a different representation of\n\n406\n00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.874\n>> RGB light values within a display and\n\n407\n00:22:03.874 --> 00:22:11.966\none quick thing is that the HSL value\nis not actually the same as the HSB.\n\n408\n00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:17.747\nSo HSL is lightness and\nB and V value is brightness.\n\n409\n00:22:17.747 --> 00:22:20.308\nBut the conversion between it.\n\n410\n00:22:20.308 --> 00:22:21.075\nYou can look it up.\n\n411\n00:22:21.075 --> 00:22:22.643\nThere's like this huge equation.\n\n412\n00:22:22.643 --> 00:22:23.721\nI'm like, no, never mind.\n\n413\n00:22:23.721 --> 00:22:26.137\nJust find an app that can\nactually do it for you.\n\n414\n00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:29.538\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you Google HSB to HSL converter,\n\n415\n00:22:29.538 --> 00:22:34.400\nthere's websites that will\njust convert it for you.\n\n416\n00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.710\n>> Now, why does that mean anything to us?\n\n417\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.752\nWell, that comes down to our next slide.\n\n418\n00:22:38.752 --> 00:22:44.058\nIs again, how can we use these\nnumerical representations,\n\n419\n00:22:44.058 --> 00:22:49.154\nthese numbers, In HTML or\nreally than more modern version\n\n420\n00:22:49.154 --> 00:22:54.267\nwould be our CSS or\ncascading style sheets for our coding.\n\n421\n00:22:54.267 --> 00:22:58.559\nAnd just click if you guys were taught,\nwhat is HTML Hypertext markup language\n\n422\n00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:01.890\nis the language that is used to\nactually code your websites.\n\n423\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:06.110\nIt's what we look at all day long,\nwhen we're looking at our pages online.\n\n424\n00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:09.410\nCSS cascade style sheets,\nthat's the formating.\n\n425\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.670\nI always like to think\nHTML is the structure.\n\n426\n00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.080\nIt's like the house.\n\n427\n00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.130\nCSS is like what color\nyou paint the house.\n\n428\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:19.540\nSo you have paragraphs, images,\nthings that you see text on a page,\n\n429\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.660\nbut then what color, does it move,\nthat kind of stuff that could be CSS, so\n\n430\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.920\nthat's like your HTML CSS\ncoding in a nut shell.\n\n431\n00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.290\nAnd how you would refer to it, you can see\nthat I've got some representations here\n\n432\n00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.570\nis that I could use a color,\na named color value.\n\n433\n00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.120\nSo color name.\n\n434\n00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.760\nI can use the hex number, or\nI could use the HSL value.\n\n435\n00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.610\nThat weird remember HSB to HSL.\n\n436\n00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.280\nYou can use that here.\n\n437\n00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.030\nHow many web sites do\nI see coded with HSL?\n\n438\n00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:58.800\nI have seen a few, I have, I don't code\nthat way, I code with just straight hex\n\n439\n00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.785\nnumbers, cuz that is what makes more\nsense to me, but it can be available.\n\n440\n00:24:03.785 --> 00:24:08.665\nAnd you can see that RGBA, that alpha\nvalue, that does mean something when\n\n441\n00:24:08.665 --> 00:24:13.395\nyou're doing HTML coding of like\nthe see-throughness of whatever color or\n\n442\n00:24:13.395 --> 00:24:15.730\na thing that you're\napplying that color to.\n\n443\n00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.200\nAnd I just threw in some numbers here.\n\n444\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:27.120\nThere's actually 140 color names\nin the HTML and CSS web code.\n\n445\n00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.695\nThings like red black, dark slate blue.\n\n446\n00:24:30.695 --> 00:24:32.616\nCuz I know what that means [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n447\n00:24:32.616 --> 00:24:37.740\n>> And then your hex number is 16,777,216.\n\n448\n00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.100\nThat number should probably make\nsense to you as well because that's.\n\n449\n00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.730\n>> It does,\nthat's because that is 24 bits, yes.\n\n450\n00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.830\nAnd you're talking about 24-bit color.\n\n451\n00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:48.530\n>> Mhm.\nYes, so.\n\n452\n00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.340\nCuz 24 bits,\nthat's three eight sets, right?\n\n453\n00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.050\nYes.\n\n454\n00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.760\nThree groups of eight bits each.\n\n455\n00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.550\n>> Yeah, that, again,\n[LAUGH] I know about this much.\n\n456\n00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.400\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, you teach me about colors,\n\n457\n00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.160\nI will teach you about binary.\n\n458\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.756\n>> Perfect.\nThat's why we make a good team together.\n\n459\n00:25:04.756 --> 00:25:05.694\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:25:05.694 --> 00:25:06.550\n>> And then again,\n\n461\n00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:10.040\nthat 216 for our websafe values,\nI kinda already mentioned that and\n\n462\n00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.230\nthe whole reason of why\nthat 216 is there for\n\n463\n00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:19.050\nback in the day whether Apple\nversus Windows displays.\n\n464\n00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:23.654\nSo that is probably all\nI could probably cover.\n\n465\n00:25:23.654 --> 00:25:25.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's everything you could probably\n\n466\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:33.220\never wanna know about Web values or color\nvalues when dealing with Web or Screen.\n\n467\n00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.280\nIt's a lot.\n\n468\n00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.950\nIt might seem almost like Greek,\nit's a lot of numbers.\n\n469\n00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.930\nI don't know exactly what they mean, but\n\n470\n00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.470\nhopefully after this lesson it\nmakes a little bit more sense.\n\n471\n00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.280\nBut that's what your Adobe profs\nare here to guide you through.\n\n472\n00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.690\nYou don't have to memorize these numbers,\nit's really just more about understanding\n\n473\n00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.480\nWhat they're doing, and\nwhat it means when they're there.\n\n474\n00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.320\n>> That's fantastic information, Vonn.\n\n475\n00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.440\nI know I enjoyed it.\n\n476\n00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.280\nI learned a ton about colors.\n\n477\n00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.780\nI hope everybody out there did, too.\n\n478\n00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.100\nAnd remember,\nwe're not done with color values.\n\n479\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.900\nWe still gotta deal with the print world,\nso make sure you come back for that.\n\n480\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.140\nMeanwhile, signing off for\nIT Pro TV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n481\n00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.058\n>> And I'm Vonn Smith.\n\n482\n00:26:11.058 --> 00:26:12.864\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n483\n00:26:12.864 -->

00:00:19.030\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.260\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at color values.\n\n5\n00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.790\nNow this is actually a part two.\n\n6\n00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.130\nIn a previous part, we took a look at\ncolor values and really focusing in on\n\n7\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.845\nweb or screen-based colors, and now we\nwanna dive into the world of print colors,\n\n8\n00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:41.240\ncuz the way we deal with the colors,\nthe way we assign values, and\n\n9\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.220\nget the colors that we want, is gonna be\ndifferent when we're dealing with web, or\n\n10\n00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.600\nprint, and here to help us\nwith that is Ms Vaughan Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.580\nHow's it going, Vaughan?\n\n12\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.050\n>> Good.\nBack again for more color valuing and\n\n13\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.760\nwhat our numbers mean.\n\n14\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.600\nLike Mike said, it is different.\n\n15\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.100\nSo now we're gonna start\ntalking about values for print.\n\n16\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.270\nAnd when we're talking about printing\nhere, we're not just talking about\n\n17\n00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.900\nprinting on your home printer,\nlike okay, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n18\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.810\nuse my little Epson or HP or whatever\nvirgin printer you're going to have.\n\n19\n00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.130\nThat your home printing is completely\ndifferent than the commercial\n\n20\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.480\nprinting process.\n\n21\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.140\nSo I'm going to tell you about that and\nhow that all works and\n\n22\n00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.180\ngive you a little view into a Print Shop.\n\n23\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.390\nI have some pictures for you, and\n\n24\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.100\nI can tell you all about it because\nI do actually a lot of work in Print.\n\n25\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.370\nSo I can kinda tell you\nall about how it works so.\n\n26\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.260\n>> Fantastic.\n\n27\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.851\n>> Yes, its fun I could probably talk for\nhours but we'll keep it condense.\n\n28\n00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:41.561\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n29\n00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:45.235\nwe'll try to make sure it's 15 to 20,\n30 minutes but no more than that.\n\n30\n00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:46.004\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n31\n00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:47.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n32\n00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.800\nprint, we're talking of our color\nvalues for print is in CMYK.\n\n33\n00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.950\nCMYK is cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.\n\n34\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.740\nThose are the different names for\n\n35\n00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.490\nthe colors of inks that are used in\nthe commercial printing process.\n\n36\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.820\nAnd this is known as a subtractive\ncolor model as opposed to back when\n\n37\n00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.880\nwe were talking about web, we were talking\nabout RGB being an additive color model.\n\n38\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.470\nTo where all the colors add\ntogether to make white,\n\n39\n00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.970\nbecause we're talking about light.\n\n40\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.090\nHere, we're talking about inks.\n\n41\n00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.365\nAnd that when you actually add, if you\nwanna say, all of your colors together.\n\n42\n00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:28.630\nYou're actually subtracting light and how\nit's reflected, so you're making black.\n\n43\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.510\nAnd this is kind of going back to\nthe way that we learned about colors\n\n44\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.520\nin kindergarten, right?\n\n45\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.260\n>> That's exactly what I was thinking.\n\n46\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.759\nI remember taking all of these colors and\nthink I'm gonna come up with some really\n\n47\n00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.690\ncool color, I'll just take every\ncolor I can get, put it in there,\n\n48\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.791\nstart mixing it up, and I ended up\nwith some muddy brown or black color.\n\n49\n00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.312\n>> It was always brown.\n\n50\n00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:48.930\nAnd I'm saying it was\nsupposed to be black.\n\n51\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.660\nSo you just, yeah, you just keep adding,\nand you just make a huge mess, and\n\n52\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.830\nthen the teacher gets really mad.\n\n53\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.160\nI got in trouble a lot with paint in\nkindergarten and things like that so.\n\n54\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.970\nBecause I was trying to\napply what I learned.\n\n55\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.135\nIt just wasn't working.\n\n56\n00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:07.166\nYes, so it's more in theory in this\nsense it really does work that\n\n57\n00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:13.210\nway almost in a sense like you don't\nreally add them altogether to make black.\n\n58\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.350\nYou actually have black as an ink.\n\n59\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.080\nAnd this ink in the printing process that\nlays that ink down on a piece of paper.\n\n60\n00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.150\nAnd you get this beautiful printed\nbrochure, or a poster, or anything that's\n\n61\n00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.620\ngoing, that you see all day long,\nnewspapers and so on and so forth.\n\n62\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.220\nSo, the values that we're using for\nCMYK are on a percentage,\n\n63\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.984\nwhere you're 0 to 100%.\n\n64\n00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:42.260\nHow much color ink is going to be laid\ndown, if you wanna say, on that paper.\n\n65\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.270\nSo you could see something\nlike this purple.\n\n66\n00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.943\nThis is again back to the yellow and\nblue make green.\n\n67\n00:03:48.943 --> 00:03:50.953\nAnd blue and red make purple.\n\n68\n00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:54.555\nSo you can keep in that sensor,\nit might be a little easier for\n\n69\n00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:59.233\nyou guessthose values again there cuz\nwe're back to the way we think of color.\n\n70\n00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:04.705\nSo, this purple be, a descent amount\nof blue, or cyan, some magenta,\n\n71\n00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:10.840\nnot much yellow maybe, and not any black,\nbecause it's not a very dark purple.\n\n72\n00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.520\nIt's a very bright purple.\n\n73\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.460\nSo that's what you go when you're\ndoing with your color values here.\n\n74\n00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.140\nSo, and we're just talking\nabout numbers right there.\n\n75\n00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.230\nWe know that if we're\ngoing to be doing black.\n\n76\n00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.690\nNow this isn't.\n\n77\n00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.060\nRemember, we have black as an ink.\n\n78\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.590\nSo, it doesn't, you don't think about\nlike, it's gonna be all cyan, all magenta,\n\n79\n00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.170\nall yellow.\n\n80\n00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.030\nWell, I say that, you can have that black\nand it's called registration black.\n\n81\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.770\nBut I don't wanna get too\ncrazy on printing right now.\n\n82\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.010\nWe're just gonna try and\nkeep it basic, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.940\nIf I was doing black and I have four\nvalues, what would that value be?\n\n84\n00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.690\n>> Well let's see, since you said\nwe got black ink and that's the K,\n\n85\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.619\nI'm gonna go with 0% for\nthe C, and the M, and the Y.\n\n86\n00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:54.309\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n87\n00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.330\n>> And then 100% for the K.\n\n88\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.060\n>> Correct, yes.\n\n89\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.470\nAnd I actually forgot the percentages\nhere because when you're talking,\n\n90\n00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.920\nif I'm talking about numbers\nI'm not saying 0%, 0%.\n\n91\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.780\n>> Right.\n>> It's just zero, zero, zero, a 100.\n\n92\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.840\nI know that that's my CMYK value, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.490\nSo, yes you're correct.\n\n94\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.240\nSo, let's go over.\n\n95\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.655\nIf I have this,\nthis is full cyan by the way.\n\n96\n00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:17.950\n[LAUGH] It's like I don't know\nwhat shade of blue that is.\n\n97\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.850\nThat's full cyan so that would be.\n\n98\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.020\n>> I like the way you make it easier for\nme, so I'm gonna say a 100 0, 0, 0.\n\n99\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.922\n>> Yes, I'm helping it out here.\n\n100\n00:05:25.922 --> 00:05:27.834\n[LAUGH]\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n101\n00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:33.460\n>> So, yes and if this is full magenta,\nI think you got the idea.\n\n102\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.220\n>> 0, 100, 0, 0.\n\n103\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.690\n>> And this is full yellow.\n\n104\n00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.830\n>> 0, 0, 100, 0.\n\n105\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.020\n>> Yes, so we've got those values for\nour pure colors.\n\n106\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.383\n>> So, and when I show you some pictures\nand we start talking about the actual\n\n107\n00:05:47.383 --> 00:05:50.475\nprinting process, you could see\nthat on those particular plates,\n\n108\n00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.349\nas they're called,\nthere's none of the ink being picked up,\n\n109\n00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.927\nit's only the magenta ink\nthat's gonna show up there.\n\n110\n00:05:55.927 --> 00:06:00.741\nSo, now white, this is almost tricky,\nbecause when we're talking\n\n111\n00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:05.520\nabout the commercial printing process,\nyou can have white ink.\n\n112\n00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.280\nSo I don't want you to think that white\nink doesn't exist but that get's way too\n\n113\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.790\ndeep into the mechanics of printing and\nit's for special occasions.\n\n114\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.340\nAnd if you're a print nerd, you're like,\nI could print white ink on paper,\n\n115\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.080\nbut let's just go with theories\nas we're talking about\n\n116\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.798\nthe theory behind all of this and\nthe values.\n\n117\n00:06:23.798 --> 00:06:28.980\nIt's really nothing, so\nlet me just give this to you.\n\n118\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.710\n>> I can say 0000.\n\n119\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.440\n>> Yes, and it is that, but\nreally what that means is it's\n\n120\n00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.570\nwhatever color the paper is,\ncuz you can have different colored paper.\n\n121\n00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.140\nYou can have an off-white paper or a pure\nwhite paper or a purple paper or whatever.\n\n122\n00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.600\n>> So if I can put that in layman's terms,\nif you think about mixing a paint,\n\n123\n00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.680\nyou're gonna put 0 this in.\n\n124\n00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.510\n0 this in.\n\n125\n00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.220\n0 of this and 0 of this and\nyou got a ball of nothing to stir up.\n\n126\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.490\nSo in theory but not in practicality.\n\n127\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.932\n>> Yes, yes,\nthere is nothing that it is paper.\n\n128\n00:06:59.932 --> 00:07:04.640\nAnd sometimes like in design I think\nI actually says that somewhere.\n\n129\n00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.810\nIt's just saying there's no ink.\n\n130\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.240\nWe're having an absence of ink.\n\n131\n00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.733\nSo with red, now red we've got here,\nI'll just help you out there.\n\n132\n00:07:15.733 --> 00:07:16.960\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Thank you.\n\n133\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.550\n>> I've been really testing you, so\nI'll give you a little break here.\n\n134\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.670\nIs that red would be a lot of magenta and\na lot of yellow, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.060\nThat makes red.\n\n136\n00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.930\nCuz you're thinking, cuz magenta's\nkinda pinkish, but that's how it works,\n\n137\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.210\nso we'll just give you that value.\n\n138\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.190\nWith the green, now green,\nthat might be a little easier for you.\n\n139\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.880\nSo, green is what two colors?\n\n140\n00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.290\n>> Green is blue and yellow?\n\n141\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.260\nSo we have a yellow right?\n\n142\n00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.780\nSay and we've got a blue sorta the cyan.\n\n143\n00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.970\n>> It's just cyan.\n\n144\n00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:55.742\n>> So we can say 100 0 100 0.\n\n145\n00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:57.574\n>> You got it right.\n[LAUGH] Good job,\n\n146\n00:07:57.574 --> 00:07:58.798\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:07:58.798 --> 00:08:01.922\n>> And the same concept there of purple\n\n148\n00:08:01.922 --> 00:08:07.440\nWould be red and blue, but\nblue is really cyan in this case.\n\n149\n00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.550\nAnd red is really magenta.\n\n150\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:15.230\nSo you've got that, you've got purple\nhere, and it's not a whole bunch of cyan.\n\n151\n00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.850\n>> Mm.\n>> It's a little bit of cyan,\n\n152\n00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:22.845\nmore magenta because purple is a little\ncloser to red pink, than it is to blue.\n\n153\n00:08:22.845 --> 00:08:24.435\n>> Mm hm.\n>> So that's why you have those different\n\n154\n00:08:24.435 --> 00:08:25.270\nvalues.\n\n155\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.760\n>> Okay.\nAnd then this orange here.\n\n156\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.685\nAnd you've got,\nit's more yellow than pink.\n\n157\n00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:32.460\n>> Mm hm.\n\n158\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.540\n>> So it's got a higher\nyellow value then magenta.\n\n159\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.980\nSo that's what you've got here.\n\n160\n00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.040\nSo just trying to give you those.\n\n161\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.490\nJust trying to demonstrate,\n\n162\n00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.750\nyou can start seeing higher values versus\nlower values and how they mix together.\n\n163\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:51.760\nAnd what those colors are going to mean,\nwhen you use it in a four color process\n\n164\n00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.380\nart work that you are going to do.\n\n165\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.870\nIf I'm doing a four color process.\n\n166\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.680\nI know I'm going to be\ncreating CMYK colors for\n\n167\n00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.130\nmy brochure or my ad or whatever.\n\n168\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.380\nSo what does that kind of look like?\n\n169\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.750\nI actually have here some pictures.\n\n170\n00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:19.740\nOf a local print shop here,\nso this is a press, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.150\nThis is a printing press,\nthis is a big guy, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.340\nThis is a specific\ncompany named Heidelberg,\n\n173\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.140\nthey're really big in\nthe printing company.\n\n174\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.170\nSo this is a Heidelberg press,\nand what you have here,\n\n175\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.870\nare you have your different towers.\n\n176\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.010\nAnd I have a little close up here.\n\n177\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:40.330\nThese towers are where\nthe color separations,\n\n178\n00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.720\nwhere the different inks actually sit for\nthe design.\n\n179\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.880\nSo let me keep going and\nthen hopefully this will all make sense.\n\n180\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.770\nSo you can see up here on top\nyou've got the ink well, and\n\n181\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.140\nyou can actually see some ink right here.\n\n182\n00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.950\nThey pour the ink in this well right\nhere and inside this tower over here,\n\n183\n00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.060\nyou have something known as a plate.\n\n184\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:09.510\nThe plate is the separated values, if you\nwanna say, for each one of those CMYK.\n\n185\n00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.440\nSo all of those different\npercentages we were talking about,\n\n186\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.050\nwhen it comes to the printing\nprocess they go ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.410\nseparate out the cyan\nmagenta yellow in the place.\n\n188\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.180\nIt's almost like a stamp.\n\n189\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.220\nRemember taking stamps?\n\n190\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.000\nYou stamp it in one ink, and\nthen you put it over to the paper.\n\n191\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.610\nAnd so whatever ink actually gets\n\n192\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.760\nabsorbed into those raised areas of\na stamp, that's where the ink sets.\n\n193\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.200\nAnd the areas where it's kind of\n[INAUDIBLE] down into or like cut into,\n\n194\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.340\nthe ink the doesn't\nabsorb into those areas.\n\n195\n00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.820\nSo just get whatever the stamp shows\nyou on to that piece of paper.\n\n196\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.200\nSo exact same idea here,\nis that this plate of where the cyan or\n\n197\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.110\nmagenta or yellow ink is suppose to lay\ndown on the paper, it rolls up into\n\n198\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:57.140\nthe ink rolls down onto the paper and\nthen it goes ahead and processes\n\n199\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.610\nthose inks together to create the full\ncolor brochure that you have at the end.\n\n200\n00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.875\nSo that's the idea the idea of\nthe printing process so I've got a little,\n\n201\n00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.735\nthis is the different\nview of the same thing,\n\n202\n00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:13.615\nof the tops of the towers on\nthe plates are on the press, and\n\n203\n00:11:13.615 --> 00:11:18.185\nso, this is where the paper starts,\nlike it goes in one side and\n\n204\n00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:21.325\nit goes through and then it lays\ndown the scion ink, then the yellow,\n\n205\n00:11:21.325 --> 00:11:24.840\nthe magenta, then the black I don't\nknow if that's the correct order.\n\n206\n00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.160\nI knew it at one point but\nI can't remember the exact one.\n\n207\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.570\nBut it does lay down\neach one of those inks.\n\n208\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.490\nAnd then it spits it out the other\nside and you get something like this.\n\n209\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.860\nYour finished printed product.\n\n210\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.511\nI think that's a pig.\n\n211\n00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:36.805\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:11:36.805 --> 00:11:38.819\n>> So you have your finished printed\n\n213\n00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:42.160\nproduct at the end because that's\nhow the printing process works.\n\n214\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:42.850\n>> Very good.\n\n215\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.610\n>> But from the very beginning, me,\n\n216\n00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.670\nas the designer who is making this\n>> Whatever this finished product is.\n\n217\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.080\nWe'll just call it a brochure.\n\n218\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.550\nI have to understand that I need to make\nsure that my colors that are in that\n\n219\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:01.778\ndesign, for the commercial printing,\nhas to be CMYK value.\n\n220\n00:12:01.778 --> 00:12:05.380\nI can't,\nI do not want to send Red green and\n\n221\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:11.860\nblue values to a print\ncompany because why.\n\n222\n00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.970\nColor gamuts.\n\n223\n00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.710\nLet me come back over to here.\n\n224\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.490\nBecause there are a whole bunch\nof colors that you can display\n\n225\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.650\nin a screen version in a web version\nwhatever you want to say In a RGB color,\n\n226\n00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.730\nI can represent a lot more colors that\ncan be truly represented onto paper.\n\n227\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.840\nHave you ever had that happen,\nwhere you print something out.\n\n228\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.110\n>> It's not quite the same as\nwhat you saw on your screen.\n\n229\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.300\n>> The colors that are the worst, are the\npurples and the blues, those are the ones,\n\n230\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.710\n>> Because it's a smaller gamut.\n\n231\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:48.510\nThe CMYK gamut of colors that can\nbe printed is smaller than RGB.\n\n232\n00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:54.270\nSo that's why you have that\noutside of the range for printing.\n\n233\n00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.420\nYou'll see that when we get into\nthe colors and the swatches.\n\n234\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.125\nIt'll say nope, this won't show you,\nlike there's no corresponding value.\n\n235\n00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:00.720\n>> Mm hm.\n\n236\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.960\n>> And so that makes a big difference so\n>> You can,\n\n237\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.140\nI try to give a little representation\nhere as like this is an RGB blue.\n\n238\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.330\nWell this RGB blue would\nnot be able to print.\n\n239\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:17.320\nThis would be the closest color it would\nlook like, you know, when you print it.\n\n240\n00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.166\nThen you get doc and all sorts of\npaper and it's a whole nother thing.\n\n241\n00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.050\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n242\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.750\n>> But it's the idea and\n\n243\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:27.810\nthe theory behind here and so\nyou have to send stuff to the printer,\n\n244\n00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.810\n>> In languages that printers talk in,\n\n245\n00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.860\nby the way that the press works and\nhow that whole process is done.\n\n246\n00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.930\nSo that's what's important.\n\n247\n00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.430\n>> Now, is the blue on the left,\n\n248\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.880\nwhich is your web,\nis that just not possible in print?\n\n249\n00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.400\nOr it would be possible if we\nknew the correct CMYK values?\n\n250\n00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.120\nWell, that's actually a really good lead\nin to the next part I was gonna start.\n\n251\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.710\nSo the thing is when you're doing anything\nwith print you never trust your screen.\n\n252\n00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.390\nYou just don't.\n\n253\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.010\nCuz like right now, your computer probably\nis gonna show colors different than my\n\n254\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.390\ncomputer, cuz we're both using Macs,\nbut my Mac is six years old.\n\n255\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.010\nSo I have a totally different\ngraphics processor.\n\n256\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.470\nMaybe what ever my monitor is looking.\n\n257\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.700\nYours are different.\n\n258\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.540\nSo, you can have color on four different\nmonitors look completely different\n\n259\n00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.690\nbecause that's just the way\nthat the monitors work.\n\n260\n00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.810\nAnd so, the same with prints.\n\n261\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.400\nI can see it on my screen but\nonce it actually gets.\n\n262\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.580\nInk to paper if you wanna say.\n\n263\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.580\nOr the rubber hits the road.\n\n264\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.150\nOr the ink hits the paper.\n\n265\n00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.860\nThat's where you're really gonna\nsee what the real color looks like.\n\n266\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.220\nAnd it really just takes experience and\njust knowing and\n\n267\n00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.740\nworking in print, day in and day out,\nand that there's so many nuances,\n\n268\n00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.150\nlike I was saying: what type\nof paper are you printing on?\n\n269\n00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.428\nAre you printing on linen paper,\nare you printing on synthetic paper?\n\n270\n00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.610\nWhat's the [INAUDIBLE],\n\n271\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.800\nwhat's the temperature of the room\nwhen the press is running?\n\n272\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.010\nI mean, it's all these different things.\n\n273\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:58.000\nSo can I reproduce,\nkinda go back to your questions, so I can,\n\n274\n00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.565\nlike I said I can talk a lot about print.\n\n275\n00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kinda getting back on to your\n\n276\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.890\nquestion like that blue\nthat I see on my screen.\n\n277\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.859\nCan I truly represent that in print?\n\n278\n00:15:08.859 --> 00:15:14.350\nIn CMYK, no like there's, I can only,\n\n279\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.040\nI can only make colors With\nthe four color process, with\n\n280\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.260\nprocessing those different percentages\nof inks, there's only so much I can do.\n\n281\n00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.290\n>> Which goes back to what you\nsaid initially, the gamut,\n\n282\n00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.830\nwhich is really the range of colors,\n>> It's so much smaller for print.\n\n283\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.130\n>> Correct.\n>> So that blue just might be\n\n284\n00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.800\noutside the gamma of print.\n\n285\n00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.300\n>> Yes.\n\n286\n00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.910\nIn the numerical value\nthat we're working in.\n\n287\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.540\nNow, have you seen brochures that\nare printed in like neon colors?\n\n288\n00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.280\n>> Yes.\n>> Or metallic or\n\n289\n00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.650\nsuper bright yellow or blue.\n\n290\n00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.050\n>> I have.\n\n291\n00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.490\n>> Well\n>> It's possible, but\n\n292\n00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.280\nit's not through CMYK.\n\n293\n00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.386\nThat gets into the wonderful\nworld of spot colors.\n\n294\n00:15:57.386 --> 00:15:58.328\nWhere did my art board go?\n\n295\n00:15:58.328 --> 00:16:00.398\nOkay, I was in the color gamut.\n\n296\n00:16:00.398 --> 00:16:01.135\nIt's over here.\n\n297\n00:16:01.135 --> 00:16:02.304\nOkay, sorry guys.\n\n298\n00:16:02.304 --> 00:16:04.135\nJumping around.\n\n299\n00:16:04.135 --> 00:16:07.478\nSpot colors, yes,\ncuz that's the differentiation.\n\n300\n00:16:07.478 --> 00:16:11.368\nWhen we're talking about print, you're\neither talking about CMYK values, or\n\n301\n00:16:11.368 --> 00:16:13.497\nyou're talking about spot colors, okay?\n\n302\n00:16:13.497 --> 00:16:19.820\nA spot color is a singe mixed ink in\none of those towers on the press.\n\n303\n00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.940\nSo that orange that we would see\nover here, like this CMYK orange,\n\n304\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:30.280\nit is a mixture of some cyan, no wait,\nmagenta and yellow inks together, right?\n\n305\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.800\nWell you could also designate\nthat color as 172C, or\n\n306\n00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:41.563\nwhatever specific number that Pantone,\nthat's one of the companies or\n\n307\n00:16:41.563 --> 00:16:44.976\nthe main people that decides what colors.\n\n308\n00:16:44.976 --> 00:16:50.810\nPantone 172C, this is a specific\nnumber that represents this orange.\n\n309\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.390\nSo it's not a mixture of inks,\nit's a single ink.\n\n310\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.080\nAnd this is where, did you ever,\n\n311\n00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.150\nI mean, did you ever go to the-\n>> Yes.\n\n312\n00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.534\n>> Back in the day, for our age,\nthe Xerox store where you'd actually go\n\n313\n00:17:02.534 --> 00:17:05.674\nto get things copied and\nprinted and everything?\n\n314\n00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:10.913\nAnd this color book,\nthis is an actual color book from Pantone\n\n315\n00:17:10.913 --> 00:17:15.459\nthat printers use to say,\nthere's a whole formula.\n\n316\n00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:20.555\nThere's a mix book if somebody in,\nif a designer designs\n\n317\n00:17:20.555 --> 00:17:27.360\na ad that is using a spot color of 172,\nthey go over to the mixing station.\n\n318\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:33.880\nAnd they actually mix that ink to whatever\nthe Pantone book says, so it's right here.\n\n319\n00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.830\nYou can actually see\nthere's a little scale and\n\n320\n00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.030\nthey take these different things.\n\n321\n00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.930\nAnd if it's a metallic versus a neon\nversus whatever, it mixes all together.\n\n322\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:48.644\nAnd on that printing press,\nthis tower has just that one spot ink.\n\n323\n00:17:48.644 --> 00:17:52.749\nAnd that's where it knows that this is\nwhere this particular ink is going to go.\n\n324\n00:17:52.749 --> 00:17:55.540\nIt's not a process color,\nit's a spot color.\n\n325\n00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.508\n>> And those spot colors can be made up of\nthings other than just the C and the Y and\n\n326\n00:17:59.508 --> 00:18:00.324\nthe M and the K?\n\n327\n00:18:00.324 --> 00:18:04.702\n>> Mm-hm, and the neon, the metallic,\nthere's different color books,\n\n328\n00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:06.090\nas they call them.\n\n329\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.120\nThere's Pantone Metallic or\nSolid Metallic.\n\n330\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.892\nThere's coated versus\nuncoated stock of the paper.\n\n331\n00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:17.920\nAnd how whatever the mixture is that\na commercial printer would know.\n\n332\n00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.966\nI just know it as 172C, and I know,\nthat's Gator orange, by the way.\n\n333\n00:18:22.966 --> 00:18:25.938\nAnd 287C, that's Gator blue.\n\n334\n00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:28.090\nAnd you could look this up\non the UF brand identity.\n\n335\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But anyways, that's how it works.\n\n336\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:35.190\nSo that's where I can use Gator blue and\n\n337\n00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:41.570\nGator orange with just a single ink\nrather than a process of inks together.\n\n338\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.670\nNow why would you do that?\n\n339\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.105\nThat gets into another area.\n\n340\n00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:49.010\nBut let me give you a short\nsynopsis of where this could be.\n\n341\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.830\nIf I'm doing a full color printing,\nthat's four inks on the press right?\n\n342\n00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.030\nFour inks, it's more money, right?\n\n343\n00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.658\nSo you have all of those inks separated.\n\n344\n00:18:59.658 --> 00:19:04.103\nIf I'm doing a one color brochure,\n\n345\n00:19:04.103 --> 00:19:09.447\nsome type of design, I can have just blue.\n\n346\n00:19:09.447 --> 00:19:16.400\nAnd if I have just blue then it's one\nplate, that's less money type thing.\n\n347\n00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.670\nSo it really just depends on\nthe resources and what you're going for.\n\n348\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:25.350\nSo you could have one ink\nin different shades or\n\n349\n00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.560\ntones, if you wanna say,\nthey're called screens.\n\n350\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.380\nAnd so you can still get like lighter blue\nand darker blue but it's only one ink.\n\n351\n00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.310\nSo it's less plates,\nless plates, less money.\n\n352\n00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.350\nAnd that's how it works.\n\n353\n00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.340\n>> That's pretty cool.\n\n354\n00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.490\n>> Or because you cannot\nget your company's color\n\n355\n00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.210\ntrue representated any other\nway besides a spot ink.\n\n356\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.720\nBecause again, that falls out of the gamut\n\n357\n00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.460\nof the CMYK possibilities of how many inks\nwe process together to make that color.\n\n358\n00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.280\nSo that's how it basically works, so.\n\n359\n00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.793\n>> That's fantastic, and\nit kind of reminds me of,\n\n360\n00:19:57.793 --> 00:20:00.670\ntake it completely away from\nthe Illustrator side of things.\n\n361\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.930\nIt reminds me of going down to one of the\nlocal hardware stores with a paint swatch.\n\n362\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.890\nAnd they have a computer\nthat looks at it and\n\n363\n00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.612\ntells them what to mix into the bucket.\n\n364\n00:20:10.612 --> 00:20:12.130\n>> That's actually, it's funny.\n\n365\n00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.860\nI used to always use that\nexample when explaining this.\n\n366\n00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.180\nSo I'm glad you reminded me.\n\n367\n00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.172\nYeah, you go to Lowe's or\nHome Depot, wherever you're going.\n\n368\n00:20:19.172 --> 00:20:22.196\nI want this, and they do the little\n[SOUND] squirt it down in there.\n\n369\n00:20:22.196 --> 00:20:23.737\nShake it all up, and that's your color.\n\n370\n00:20:23.737 --> 00:20:25.320\n>> So, using the same thing,\nthe same process.\n\n371\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.580\n>> It's the exact same concept so\nthere you go.\n\n372\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.114\nSo that's where we got process\ncolors versus spot colors\n\n373\n00:20:33.114 --> 00:20:36.145\nin the commercial printing process.\n\n374\n00:20:36.145 --> 00:20:38.865\nI just want to throw just two other\nlittle things in here, just for\n\n375\n00:20:38.865 --> 00:20:40.550\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n376\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.533\nIf I was sending this to the printer,\nright?\n\n377\n00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:47.760\nAnd I've got all my colors\nin either CMYK or spot.\n\n378\n00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.600\nThis is something that in,\nthis is Illustrator.\n\n379\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.986\nYou can do the same thing in InDesign,\nit's just in a different panel and\n\n380\n00:20:55.986 --> 00:20:56.885\nthings like that.\n\n381\n00:20:56.885 --> 00:21:00.283\nBut I wanted to show you that they have\nsomething known as a Separations Preview\n\n382\n00:21:00.283 --> 00:21:01.090\npanel, okay?\n\n383\n00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.490\nTo where it will actually show\nme the different plates, or\n\n384\n00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.795\nwhat would look on a plate.\n\n385\n00:21:06.795 --> 00:21:08.261\n>> Really?\n>> Now, one other thing I wanna show you\n\n386\n00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:09.389\nis that when you're using this,\n\n387\n00:21:09.389 --> 00:21:11.300\nyou do have to be in what's\nknown as Overprint Preview.\n\n388\n00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.740\nSo you can actually see this.\n\n389\n00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.830\nSo you see there's an actual\ncheckbox right there.\n\n390\n00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.894\nI went through the View menu cuz I\nwanted to show you that's where you can\n\n391\n00:21:17.894 --> 00:21:18.619\nchange it here.\n\n392\n00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:19.478\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n393\n00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:20.980\n>> And\nthen there's the Separations Preview.\n\n394\n00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.960\nSo you can see that right now it is\nshowing me how everything would look like\n\n395\n00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.910\nin its finished version,\nwhen it gets out to the end of the press.\n\n396\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.399\nAnd I can turn on and\noff my different ones.\n\n397\n00:21:32.399 --> 00:21:35.515\nNotice that I would know that if I\nwas sending this to the printer,\n\n398\n00:21:35.515 --> 00:21:38.480\nthis would be a five color job,\nthis would be five inks.\n\n399\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:47.690\nBecause I designed the actual material\nwith the Pantone value in my file.\n\n400\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.710\nSo if I was only wanting to do four\ncolor process, that would be bad.\n\n401\n00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.990\nSo again, you don't wanna\nuse 15 spots in your design.\n\n402\n00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.130\nBecause that's a lot of money and\nyou don't wanna do that.\n\n403\n00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.970\nSo knowing when to use spots and process.\n\n404\n00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.610\nAnyway, so\nlet me just kinda turn all of this off so\n\n405\n00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:08.010\nyou can see that this is where I\nwould have all the cyan information.\n\n406\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.030\nNotice that back in here,\nis the yellow there?\n\n407\n00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:16.580\nNo, the only Information on\nthat cyan plate would be here.\n\n408\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.280\nAnd then if I did the magenta,\nthat's where the magenta.\n\n409\n00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.055\nSo remember back to that stamp idea?\n\n410\n00:22:21.055 --> 00:22:23.420\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This is where the stamp would be\n\n411\n00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:29.240\nabsorbing that ink cuz it goes around\non the tower and so on and so forth.\n\n412\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.140\nSo it's kind of fun to show you\nwhere the information is here.\n\n413\n00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.960\nAnd then you can see that that would\nbe the only place where, on that plate,\n\n414\n00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.195\nwould be pick up that spot ink and\nroll it down onto the paper, so.\n\n415\n00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:46.770\n>> So if you're able to somehow stop\nthe print job between those towers,\n\n416\n00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.330\nyou would see something like that?\n\n417\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.415\nAfter the first pass it might\njust have the cyan on there?\n\n418\n00:22:50.415 --> 00:22:55.425\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, and then if it got through\ntwo of them, then it would look like that.\n\n419\n00:22:55.425 --> 00:22:59.879\nCuz only the cyan and the magenta\ninks have processed down together and\n\n420\n00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:01.628\nthat's what you see, so.\n\n421\n00:23:01.628 --> 00:23:05.880\nAnd then one other fun\nlittle tidbit about black.\n\n422\n00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.960\nCuz I said, remember,\nwe don't wanna add up together.\n\n423\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.860\nBut there are many different\nthings with black, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.210\nSo notice here I have, there's\nblack here and there's black there.\n\n425\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:20.330\nBut then on the yellow,\nthat one's coming up right over here.\n\n426\n00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.024\nThe magenta shows you,\nit's like so wait a second.\n\n427\n00:23:23.024 --> 00:23:27.246\nI thought black was just 100% black and\n0 for the other.\n\n428\n00:23:27.246 --> 00:23:30.282\nWell, kind of, okay?\n\n429\n00:23:30.282 --> 00:23:33.330\nThere are many type of\ndifferent types of black.\n\n430\n00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.850\nThere's cool black, there's warm black.\n\n431\n00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:43.560\nIt's really just different,\nvarying shades of black.\n\n432\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.644\nSo black is the new black.\n\n433\n00:23:44.644 --> 00:23:45.705\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what I wanted to title\n\n434\n00:23:45.705 --> 00:23:48.005\nthis little guy.\n\n435\n00:23:48.005 --> 00:23:53.061\nSo understanding how it's gonna show\nup on the actual print is important and\n\n436\n00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:55.036\nhow it kinda mixes together.\n\n437\n00:23:55.036 --> 00:24:00.298\nSo I got this little chart right here,\nlet me close this, of standard black\n\n438\n00:24:00.298 --> 00:24:06.410\nthat we were talking about 0, 0 0, 100,\nand then you have Registration Black.\n\n439\n00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.356\nRegistration Black is all\nof them together, and\n\n440\n00:24:08.356 --> 00:24:10.210\nI said that's not how you really do it.\n\n441\n00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.410\nYou really don't ever wanna\ndesignate black as 100 for\n\n442\n00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:19.520\nall four values in your file because\nit just doesn't work that way.\n\n443\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.050\nIt's 400% coverage, you don't want that.\n\n444\n00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:27.300\nYou do use that for registration, because\nas the paper's going through the press,\n\n445\n00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:32.330\nthe person operating the machine is\nactually watching those registrations\n\n446\n00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:37.255\nto make sure that nothing shifts\nwhen the process is going.\n\n447\n00:24:37.255 --> 00:24:40.755\nI remember seeing on the comics\nsection of the newspaper.\n\n448\n00:24:40.755 --> 00:24:42.285\n>> Sometimes it will be a little off and\n\n449\n00:24:42.285 --> 00:24:44.325\nyou can the different colors\ninstead of what they wanted.\n\n450\n00:24:44.325 --> 00:24:47.060\n>> Yeah, and it almost looked\nlike three glasses were off.\n\n451\n00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.180\n>> Yes.\nIt's because the registration,\n\n452\n00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.960\nas it's going through the printer,\nit shifted.\n\n453\n00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.652\n>> And the registration,\nmeans the alignment of the paper?\n\n454\n00:24:54.652 --> 00:24:55.512\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n455\n00:24:55.512 --> 00:25:00.011\n>> There's registration marks on the press\nsheets, that go all the way through, and\n\n456\n00:25:00.011 --> 00:25:03.416\nif they start mixing up, or\nyou can start seeing the shifting,\n\n457\n00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:06.200\nthat's where they know,\nthey gotta go back.\n\n458\n00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200\nThey gotta adjust it.\n\n459\n00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.780\nThere's tons of adjustments when you're\ndoing a print run for any publication.\n\n460\n00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.020\nAnd that's where you can see.\n\n461\n00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:13.850\nAnd sometimes where,\n\n462\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:18.250\nI remember in newspapers, some of it will\nbe darker than the other newspaper, right?\n\n463\n00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:18.900\n>> Right.\n\n464\n00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:24.820\n>> Cuz ones later in the press run\nthan the earlier first part of it.\n\n465\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.760\nNow, of course you don't\nwanna do that normally, so\n\n466\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.900\nthat's why you have people\nthat are operating it.\n\n467\n00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.540\nBut that's what registration black.\n\n468\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.540\nNow, kinda back to this whole ideas\nthat you can have different values for\n\n469\n00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.750\nblack and lets just kinda,\ndo these all look the same to you?\n\n470\n00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.169\n>> They look identical.\n\n471\n00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.090\n>> They're all black, right?\n\n472\n00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.440\n>> Correct.\n\n473\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.240\n>> Well, they're actually not.\n\n474\n00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.163\nThese are all different values, and\nthis is because of a default setting or\n\n475\n00:25:53.163 --> 00:25:57.123\npreference in almost all\nof your Adobe products.\n\n476\n00:25:57.123 --> 00:26:03.070\nIt is rich black versus actual black.\n\n477\n00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:08.000\nNow rich black you can use that as\na printing term people say like to get\n\n478\n00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.520\nthat real black it's really not just\n00 100 it's, you get a little cyan,\n\n479\n00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.180\na little magenta,\n\n480\n00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:19.190\nyou do have a specific mixture that does\nlook like black on the printed paper.\n\n481\n00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:26.150\nBut more here, when we're talking about\non screen, the default preference\n\n482\n00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:33.030\nin Illustrator is that all of your blacks\nthat you mix will always look the same.\n\n483\n00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:38.360\nBecause they're trying to show the black\nas deep as black as possible for\n\n484\n00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.030\nyour screen version,\nnot the actual values.\n\n485\n00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.650\nAnd this is anything that\nyou're doing with a CMYK.\n\n486\n00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.220\nIf you're starting a new file in CMYK,\n\n487\n00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.490\nthis is something you do need to just\nat least be aware of, all right?\n\n488\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.950\nSo, they all look the same.\n\n489\n00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:53.550\nWell, let me show you.\n\n490\n00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.640\nSo if I go to the Illustrator menu,\nand I go to my Preferences.\n\n491\n00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.890\nIt's in your Edit menu for Windows.\n\n492\n00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.029\nAnd see Appearance Of Black?\n\n493\n00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.910\nIt is set to my on-screen,\ndisplays all black as rich black, and\n\n494\n00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.440\nit has a description down there, and\nyou might not be able to read it.\n\n495\n00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.745\nSo, it says displaying all blacks as\nrich black will show both pure blacks,\n\n496\n00:27:12.745 --> 00:27:17.340\n100% k, and rich blacks, blacks with\nmixed CMYK values as rich black.\n\n497\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.460\nThis will not change the color\nvalues in the document, but how it\n\n498\n00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.740\nactually shows on the screen, but all\nblacks will appear as dark as possible.\n\n499\n00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.276\n>> So if I leave that setting on my\nscreen they're gonna look the same, but\n\n500\n00:27:28.276 --> 00:27:30.065\nthe printer would be able\nto tell the difference.\n\n501\n00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:35.397\n>> Yes, if I sent it to a printer and\nthe default black of rich black is there,\n\n502\n00:27:35.397 --> 00:27:38.590\nit's not just black, it's all of the ink.\n\n503\n00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:42.850\nSo, I'm gonna show this to where\nit's going to on screen display\n\n504\n00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.730\nall blacks accurately to where the values\n\n505\n00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.290\nare a more true representation\nof what it's gonna look like.\n\n506\n00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:49.830\nAnd let's just see before.\n\n507\n00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:50.632\nSee, all the blacks.\n\n508\n00:27:50.632 --> 00:27:54.974\nNow let's go with, okay,\nthose are not the same colors are they?\n\n509\n00:27:54.974 --> 00:27:55.985\n>> Wow.\nBig difference.\n\n510\n00:27:55.985 --> 00:27:57.480\n>> Huge, yeah.\n\n511\n00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.890\nSo this is a black that has\na higher magenta value.\n\n512\n00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.890\nThis is a black that has\na higher cyan value.\n\n513\n00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:09.760\nThis is actually 000100 but\nit looks gray to us.\n\n514\n00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.592\nAnd so, that's why Adobe is trying to show\nyou on the screen that it's black but\n\n515\n00:28:15.592 --> 00:28:19.740\nif I'm showing you accurately\nit looks a little gray.\n\n516\n00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.200\nAnd so, that's why the default setting\nin Illustrator is set to rich black.\n\n517\n00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.240\n>> That would throw people off.\n\n518\n00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.442\nI swear I'm picking black and it's\ncoming up gray, so they fix that for us.\n\n519\n00:28:27.442 --> 00:28:33.590\n>> Yes, so, and that is when\nyou're in a CMYK color mode file.\n\n520\n00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.948\nThis doesn't really mean\nanything in RGB because RGB,\n\n521\n00:28:35.948 --> 00:28:38.103\nwe're working in a file that's for\nthe screen, so\n\n522\n00:28:38.103 --> 00:28:41.381\nit's just whatever the screen looks like,\nthat's what you're gonna get.\n\n523\n00:28:41.381 --> 00:28:44.972\nYou don't have the same limitations\nof doing any graphics for\n\n524\n00:28:44.972 --> 00:28:48.218\nweb in a sense,\nbecause it's already on the screen, so\n\n525\n00:28:48.218 --> 00:28:51.341\nwhatever it looks like,\nit's gonna look like that.\n\n526\n00:28:51.341 --> 00:28:55.872\nWhether it's on a website, yes you\nhave monitor differentiations between\n\n527\n00:28:55.872 --> 00:29:01.390\noperating systems, but it's so slight, and\nit's just what you see is what you get.\n\n528\n00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.760\nPrint is a whole other world.\n\n529\n00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.180\nYou have to trust the numbers,\nyou have to know the numbers.\n\n530\n00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.775\nAnd you have to know when to use what and\nwhat it really means.\n\n531\n00:29:09.775 --> 00:29:13.845\nAnd you do not use RGB values\nin commercial printing and\n\n532\n00:29:13.845 --> 00:29:17.615\nyou do not send RGB values to\na printer cuz they will not like you.\n\n533\n00:29:17.615 --> 00:29:19.785\n[LAUGH] Well,\nthey'll convert it for you and\n\n534\n00:29:19.785 --> 00:29:23.345\neverything but it's just kind of\none of those rules of the land.\n\n535\n00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:27.493\nIt's CMYK, 300 resolution and I know this\nisn't an episode about resolution but\n\n536\n00:29:27.493 --> 00:29:29.174\nthat will come in later episodes.\n\n537\n00:29:29.174 --> 00:29:35.444\nRGB, RGB 72, CMYK, 300, print.\n\n538\n00:29:35.444 --> 00:29:36.837\nThat's how it works.\n\n539\n00:29:36.837 --> 00:29:38.160\n>> All right, Vonne.\nFantastic.\n\n540\n00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.100\nAgain, a lot of great information about\ncolor values in the world of print and\n\n541\n00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.211\nheck a lot of great information\nabout the printing process.\n\n542\n00:29:45.211 --> 00:29:51.388\nEven get to see some of those big bad\nprinters, not your old deskjet, right?\n\n543\n00:29:51.388 --> 00:29:53.490\nAll right, we thank you for that Vonn.\n\n544\n00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.420\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching,\nsigning off for ITProTV,\n\n545\n00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.790\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n546\n00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:58.790\n>> And I'm Vonn

00:00:19.640\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.550\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at colors in Illustrator.\n\n5\n00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.000\nOn other episodes we took at\nlook at some color theory\n\n6\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.990\nwe talked about the different\nvalues to represent the colors.\n\n7\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.230\nHex RGB other things like that.\n\n8\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.540\nAnd now we're going to\nget into Illustrator and\n\n9\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.920\nsee how we actually go\nabout picking our colors.\n\n10\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.100\nAnd here to help us out of course is Ms.\nVonsmith how's it going Von.\n\n11\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.820\n>> Great.\n\n12\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.370\nGood to be back again to continue\nour coloring and swatching and\n\n13\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.500\nall sorts of different [LAUGH]\n>> Things we need to find\n\n14\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.180\nin Illustrator to represent our colors.\n\n15\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.300\nThere's a lot of different places\nthat you can go to in Illustrator to,\n\n16\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.050\nfind the color value that we were\ngoing over in the last episode.\n\n17\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.210\nI wanna to just jump right in, show you\nwhere everything is and show you all\n\n18\n00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.440\nthe 15,000 different ways [LAUGH]\nto find your colors in Illustrator.\n\n19\n00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.470\nIllustrator.\n\n20\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.490\nSo let's go ahead and get rolling, I'm\nactually right here on the same file that\n\n21\n00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.470\nwe've left off on when we were\ntalking about the values.\n\n22\n00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.340\nThis should look familiar.\n\n23\n00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.100\nIf you haven't seen those episodes,\nof course, go back and watch them.\n\n24\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.210\nSo we've got here, and\nI'm just gonna start anywhere.\n\n25\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.700\nMaybe we'll just start on the web values.\n\n26\n00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.600\nSo, where can I find the values For\n\n27\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.220\nany colors that I wanna apply, or\neven have on my document already.\n\n28\n00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.440\nWell, let's start first of\nall with the color picker.\n\n29\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.470\nThe color picker is over\nhere in the tools panel,\n\n30\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.540\nand it's where you have either the fill or\nthe stroke.\n\n31\n00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.240\nNow, something to point out here in this,\n\n32\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.760\nbefore we actually get into the color\npicker Is which ones on top.\n\n33\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.520\nRight now you see the overlap here that\nthe fill corner on those two right there.\n\n34\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.100\nThat's on top as opposed to if I click\nfrom this one you can see that the stroke\n\n35\n00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.280\nis now on top.\n\n36\n00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.370\nSo whichever one is on top\nwhen you double click that's\n\n37\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.290\nwhere we're going to get\nin to the color picker.\n\n38\n00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.790\nBut something to notice before we\nget in to it because it does make\n\n39\n00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.120\na little bit of a difference\nas off to put a meaning\n\n40\n00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.600\nas when you're going to apply it to\nsomething that might be selected.\n\n41\n00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.520\nNow right now I don't have any objects or\nshapes or\n\n42\n00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.030\nanything like that selected on my\ndocument so we're good with that.\n\n43\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.690\nI just want to show you\nthe Color Picker so let’s get into it.\n\n44\n00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.480\nDouble clicking on there brings up this\nColor Picker this is the same thing you\n\n45\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.800\ncan do in Photoshop, so if you're\nused to that this is very similar.\n\n46\n00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.980\nSo you can see here that I\nhad actually left off on\n\n47\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.230\nselecting an orange color in the document.\n\n48\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.930\nSo it still has orange in the fill and\n\n49\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.020\nyou can see right over here all\nof those wonderful numbers.\n\n50\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.610\nThat we were talking about in the other\nepisode, which is really, really fun.\n\n51\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.110\n>> Nice.\n\n52\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.340\n>> So you can see I've got my RGB value.\n\n53\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.900\nI have my CMYK value.\n\n54\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.350\nI have my HEX value.\n\n55\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.950\n>> Can you zoom in to that\npart just a little bit?\n\n56\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.790\n>> Sure, there we go.\n\n57\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.550\n>> There it is.\n\n58\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.730\nIt is.\n>> Probably a little easier to\n\n59\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.432\nsee for y'all on that.\n\n60\n00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:08.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you can see right here,\n\n61\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.250\nthat's the RGB value.\n\n62\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.900\nWe have over here, the CMYK value,\nand the percentages,\n\n63\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.450\nbecause that's how CMYK\nvalues are represented.\n\n64\n00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.050\nWe have our hex number there with\nthat little hashtag or pound sign,\n\n65\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.440\nwhichever way you wanna call it there,\nto represent that hex number.\n\n66\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.400\nAnd then up at the top we have our, HSBR\nour hue saturation brightness values for\n\n67\n00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.580\nthis particular color so\nlet me go ahead and do this.\n\n68\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.940\nYou have over here ,you have our\nHughes Spectrum to where you can go up and\n\n69\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.900\ndown and\nthen you have this big square over here.\n\n70\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.740\nAnd then these two guys I’ll show you in\njust a second so I can take it cuz maybe\n\n71\n00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.520\nI'm looking for I don't want orange I\nwanna make something of a pink color or\n\n72\n00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.550\npurple color because I wanna use\nthat somewhere in my document.\n\n73\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.010\nSo I can take this hue slider and\nI can slide this up,\n\n74\n00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.090\nand you can see as I slide up through\nhere, it's going to change over on that\n\n75\n00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.970\nbig square on the left to that different\nhue of where I'm at right now.\n\n76\n00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.465\nIf that makes any sense.\n\n77\n00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:09.540\n[LAUGH] So the thing to notice here in\nthe big square is where is the circle.\n\n78\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.960\nOK, you can see right here I'm moving\nit and it's changing the big square but\n\n79\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.290\nwherever that little\ncircle is right there,\n\n80\n00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.850\nthat's what color you're going to\nend up with when you say okay.\n\n81\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.760\nAnd that's where these\ntwo squares right here.\n\n82\n00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.440\nAre showing you.\n\n83\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.110\nThe one on top is where you are right now,\n\n84\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.020\nbased on that circle, and the bottom\none was this color you started with.\n\n85\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.970\nSo, if I was trying to find\na different shade of blue,\n\n86\n00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.250\nor, maybe, a different shade of orange,\nlet me come back down here.\n\n87\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.830\nSo, I could see that,\n\n88\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.560\nmaybe, that orange is a little bit\ndarker than the one I started with, so\n\n89\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.370\nit's kind of like a compare and contrast,\nand saying, whatever's right here,\n\n90\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.230\nthat's gonna be the color that is now\nin that fill area, when you say okay.\n\n91\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.790\nSo, that's why you have the top and\nbottom.\n\n92\n00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.210\nAnd, if I'm in this,\nlet's go back up to the pink,\n\n93\n00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.260\ncuz that's where I was going with first.\n\n94\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.180\nThat's kind of more Purple y.\n\n95\n00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.700\nI don't really want it to be that bright,\n\n96\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.120\nmaybe I want it to be a little\nbit more of a pastel.\n\n97\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.410\nWell, then, that's where I have to\ncome over in this big square and\n\n98\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:14.095\nactually click into the area that is, kind\nof, showing me the actual color I want.\n\n99\n00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:16.220\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Okay, so it's actually two pieces,\n\n100\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.480\nmoving the hue slider and\nthen picking the color in the big box.\n\n101\n00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.280\nAnd so, I get a lot of people, that\nthey'll come up to the very top corner.\n\n102\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.420\nSee that's white and\nthen of course that's black.\n\n103\n00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.560\nYou can slide this hue slider up and\ndown all day long and\n\n104\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.330\nnothing's going to happen because\nit'll all the way to black, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.420\nSo that's where you got to\nmake sure you got the circle.\n\n106\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.270\nAlways watch whats in that box.\n\n107\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.190\nAlright lets go over a few other\nthings that's going on in.\n\n108\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.870\nThis dialog box are these\ntwo little icons.\n\n109\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.770\nNow notice they're not\ngonna show up all the time.\n\n110\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.450\nIf I come over here that little\nwarning sign goes away and\n\n111\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.320\nthere it comes back again,\nthen it goes away.\n\n112\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.990\nYou'll probably always\nget this bottom one.\n\n113\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.180\nOkay, so, what does this mean?\n\n114\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.540\nWhat do we got going on here?\n\n115\n00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.820\nWell, this is where understanding\nthe difference between RGB and CMYK,\n\n116\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.730\nand that whole color gamut that we have,\nthat we have certain colors in a CMYK that\n\n117\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.530\nwill not be able to be reproduced,\nthat's this warning.\n\n118\n00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.290\nAnd if I hover over this little warning,\nit's actually telling me,\n\n119\n00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.940\nI don't know if I can zoom in on this\ncuz if I move my mouse, it'll show.\n\n120\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.460\nIt says out of the gamut warning.\n\n121\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.700\nAnd it says CMYK.\n\n122\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.180\nHere, let me move back over there.\n\n123\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.830\nSo, it says click to correct.\n\n124\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.930\nIf I actually click on this,\n\n125\n00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.390\nyou see how it moved the circle to\nthe closest value that it could find.\n\n126\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.680\nThat would be able to be\nin that CMYK color gamut.\n\n127\n00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.130\nSo it's actually very\nhandy where if I'm like,\n\n128\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.480\nI really love this color, it's gonna say,\nwait, wait, wait, you're gonna have\n\n129\n00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.950\nissues if you send this to a printer,\nit's not gonna look the same.\n\n130\n00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.310\nIt doesn't say that you\ncan't have that value, but\n\n131\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.480\nwhen you get to the part\nwhere you send the file,\n\n132\n00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.430\nthe printer's going to call you\nhopefully if they're a good printer,\n\n133\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.660\nthey're doing the right print, pre\npress for you or pre flighting for you.\n\n134\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.600\nAnd pre press.\n\n135\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.040\nThey'll say, well,\nyour colors might actually shift.\n\n136\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.750\nOkay?\nSo I don't want you think it's completely\n\n137\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.890\nnot allowed.\n\n138\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.930\nYou're just going to have color shifting\nwhen it's in the final product.\n\n139\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.770\n>> So if you were designing\nsomething that was for screen and\n\n140\n00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.990\nyou had no intention of ever printing it.\n\n141\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.650\nIt'd be fine.\n\n142\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.400\n>> Doesn't matter, yeah, exactly.\n\n143\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.940\nAnd that also kinda comes back to when\nyou start the new file, which we'll get\n\n144\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.890\ninto and I'll show you some demonstrations\nso you can really see the differences.\n\n145\n00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:32.310\nIf I'm going to be working in\nan RGB File new, from the start,\n\n146\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.470\nis all the values are going to be in RGB.\n\n147\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:39.220\nIf I start in a CMYK file, then all my\nvalues are gonna be in the CMYK, but\n\n148\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.400\nthe color picker doesn't matter,\nwhether you're in a RGB or\n\n149\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.240\na CMYK files, it's just saying,\nhere's all your colors.\n\n150\n00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.170\nIt's giving you all the options so knowing\nthe numbers and where you're going.\n\n151\n00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.760\nI would say I design backwards.\n\n152\n00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.960\nYou have to know where you're\ngoing before you start.\n\n153\n00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.671\nSo if you know you're designing for\nprint then you work within those confines.\n\n154\n00:07:57.671 --> 00:07:59.574\nAnd screen is a lot easier,\nlike we were talking about,\n\n155\n00:07:59.574 --> 00:08:00.802\nit's just whatever it looks like.\n\n156\n00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:03.762\nOkay, so\none last thing that I want to further,\n\n157\n00:08:03.762 --> 00:08:07.025\nthere was one other warning\ndialog thing over here.\n\n158\n00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:08.802\nAnd that was this little guy.\n\n159\n00:08:08.802 --> 00:08:13.376\nAnd this tells you that you are out\nof the gamut for web safe colors.\n\n160\n00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:15.600\nNow back from our other lesson.\n\n161\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.140\nThere's only 256 web safe colors.\n\n162\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.360\nThere's not a lot of\ncolors to pick from there.\n\n163\n00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.642\nBut if being web safe is important to you,\nthen that will actually take you to,\n\n164\n00:08:24.642 --> 00:08:29.603\nand you can see right there in our value,\nthrough those 9's and 6's and\n\n165\n00:08:29.603 --> 00:08:33.125\nC's and the double values for\neach ones of our RGB and\n\n166\n00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:36.760\nthat's gonna take you to\nthe closest web safe value.\n\n167\n00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.500\nBut then, of course,\nyou see it throws you into a,\n\n168\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.880\nnow you're in this same like K warning.\n\n169\n00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.230\nThose two warnings are really for\ntwo different reasons so\n\n170\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.170\nit's really kind of one or the other.\n\n171\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.610\nThere's still colors that will not\nhave any warnings but we got that.\n\n172\n00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.736\nAnd then the one last thing\nright over here is that,\n\n173\n00:08:52.736 --> 00:08:56.660\nsorry, my zoom doesn't do really do very\nwhen well it's over here, there we go.\n\n174\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.820\nYou can check the box of for\nOnly Web Color.\n\n175\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.330\nIf you check that you can see\nit actually segments into,\n\n176\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.950\nalright here's your spectrum but\nthere's only so\n\n177\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.140\nmany things I can click on and\nthere are these quadrants and\n\n178\n00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.320\nyou can see the numbers changing down\nhere to be into those web safe values.\n\n179\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.980\nSo that's a check box that's in actually\na lot of Adobe products that will\n\n180\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.620\nlimit it to only having web safe colors.\n\n181\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.720\nSo I'm gonna go back to that\npink because I really wanted it.\n\n182\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.310\nAnd since it doesn't really matter to\nme right now that I'm doing CMYK or\n\n183\n00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.640\nweb safe, I'm gonna ignore those\nwarnings and just move on.\n\n184\n00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.990\nAnd so I click okay and then there you go.\n\n185\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.760\nI can see that this color\nis the one that is there.\n\n186\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.450\nSo if I started to like draw another\nsquare or something, you could see that\n\n187\n00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:46.290\nthat's the fill that I have chosen to go\nahead and be designated at that point.\n\n188\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.000\nOkay.\nSo\n\n189\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.260\nthat's one place that you can\nfind where you can pick colors.\n\n190\n00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.035\nThe color picker.\n\n191\n00:09:53.035 --> 00:09:54.090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n192\n00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.680\n>> You also have the color panel.\n\n193\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.510\nNow I'm in the essentials work space and\nI did reset my panel.\n\n194\n00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:06.290\nSo hopefully it will represent\nwhat you see when you start\n\n195\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.880\nIllustrator from the very beginning\nbecause there's some things you\n\n196\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.290\nneed to be careful about\nas well in the color panel.\n\n197\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:11.870\nAll right?\n\n198\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.600\nSo it looks like that little guy.\n\n199\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.460\nWhen I first started it's just this kind\nof huge spectrum that we were seeing,\n\n200\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.500\nalmost like in the Color Picker.\n\n201\n00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.525\nAnd that is our hex number, right?\n\n202\n00:10:20.525 --> 00:10:21.220\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n203\n00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.940\n>> But it's not showing me places,\nI'm sorry, let me keep going.\n\n204\n00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.100\nI can click on it and you can see\nit's actually changing over here.\n\n205\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.160\nThat whatever I click in the color is\ngonna bring up of whatever's in the fill,\n\n206\n00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.040\nbecause that's on top.\n\n207\n00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.270\nBut the Panel Options, the four lines and\nthe triangle button as I call it,\n\n208\n00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.280\nright there.\n\n209\n00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.790\nThat's where you need to click\non it to show your options.\n\n210\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.060\nAnd when I show the options here,\n\n211\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.620\nit's going to give me a lot\nmore that I could see.\n\n212\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.410\nIt's gonna give me the RGB sliders.\n\n213\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.460\nNow, why is it giving me RGB?\n\n214\n00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.310\nIs it because right here\nI have an RGB file?\n\n215\n00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.660\nI'm actually gonna file a new\nM in the RGB color space?\n\n216\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.380\nKind of.\n\n217\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.114\n[LAUGH] But just like the color picker,\n\n218\n00:11:01.114 --> 00:11:05.670\nthe color panel doesn't care\nwhat color file space you have.\n\n219\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.503\nWhether you're RGB CMYK,\n\n220\n00:11:07.503 --> 00:11:12.270\nit's just showing you however you\nhave decided to show the sliders.\n\n221\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.750\nOkay, so it's just because we can\nrepresent colors in many different ways.\n\n222\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.380\nSo this is just showing you the RGB and\nI can slide these up and\n\n223\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.670\nI can slide these down to kind\nof get an idea of what I want.\n\n224\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.980\nBut if I change this over to CMYK,\nit's gonna let me mix,\n\n225\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:33.510\nif you wanna say colors within the CMYK\nversion or measurement system and\n\n226\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.145\nsay all right, well then there's that teal\ngreen that you're mixing right there.\n\n227\n00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:41.930\nIt's whatever you decide you\nwant the color panel to show it.\n\n228\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:48.450\nSo again, doesn't matter what your\nactual purpose is of that file.\n\n229\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.820\n>> Right.\n>> So always be careful about\n\n230\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.080\nthose things.\n\n231\n00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.240\nAnd of course, you've got your HSB and\ndifferent stuff like that.\n\n232\n00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.010\n>> You might assume,\n\n233\n00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.858\nyou started with an RGB file that it's\nonly going to show you RGB color values.\n\n234\n00:11:58.858 --> 00:11:59.580\nAnd then you get in there and\n\n235\n00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.580\nall of the sudden,\nyou don't notice that it's maybe CMYK.\n\n236\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:08.940\n>> Yes, but it does go back to,\nif it is that file new.\n\n237\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.160\nLike if you're in an RGB color mode or\nspace when you're doing that file.\n\n238\n00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.840\nIt will, it will be those values.\n\n239\n00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.550\n>> Okay.\n>> When we get into CMYK,\n\n240\n00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.860\nI'll give you some more demonstrations,\n\n241\n00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.260\nso we can maybe really drive\nthe point home a little bit more.\n\n242\n00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.310\nBut yeah, sliders show whatever you\ntell it to show in the color panel.\n\n243\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.800\nCool, and you can see over here that,\n\n244\n00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.350\nand also to show remember our values that,\nour value games, that's where I was\n\n245\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.250\ngetting the actual numbers to be able\nto type them in on this little handout.\n\n246\n00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.670\nSo if I click here it's showing me,\nsee I was right.\n\n247\n00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.469\nYay! [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, just for fun to show\n\n248\n00:12:44.469 --> 00:12:48.968\nyou that I have this one, right, that I\nsaid it was 100% and I click on this,\n\n249\n00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:53.692\nwell, it's just going to show me the RGB\ncolor value because that's the sliders.\n\n250\n00:12:53.692 --> 00:12:57.296\nIf I change the sliders over to CMYK,\nit's like wait a second,\n\n251\n00:12:57.296 --> 00:13:01.255\nthat's not a hundred zero zero like\nyou told me it was supposed to be.\n\n252\n00:13:01.255 --> 00:13:02.169\n>> It's not.\n>> It's not.\n\n253\n00:13:02.169 --> 00:13:03.490\n>> What did you do?\n\n254\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.197\n[LAUGH]\n>> What did I do?\n\n255\n00:13:05.197 --> 00:13:07.086\nI lied, no.\n\n256\n00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:11.251\nBecause my file is in an RGB color mode so\nit doesn't,\n\n257\n00:13:11.251 --> 00:13:16.158\nit's gonna always kinda go back\nto where it thinks that color is\n\n258\n00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:21.950\nin that space and\nthat doesn't always translate just right.\n\n259\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.197\nSo I'll probably say it a few more times,\n\n260\n00:13:24.197 --> 00:13:27.294\nit's all about what type of\nfile color space you're in.\n\n261\n00:13:27.294 --> 00:13:30.278\n[LAUGH] So yeah.\n\n262\n00:13:30.278 --> 00:13:31.157\nSo don't look at the values.\n\n263\n00:13:31.157 --> 00:13:31.968\nIf you get this file and\n\n264\n00:13:31.968 --> 00:13:35.190\nyou're putting it up it's like these are\nnot the CMYK values that you have written.\n\n265\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.896\nYeah I know.\n\n266\n00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:38.980\n[LAUGH] I did that kind of on purpose.\n\n267\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:44.172\nAll right, so\nlet's move over to the color guide because\n\n268\n00:13:44.172 --> 00:13:49.060\nthis is another place that you can find\ncolors and I'll tie our other lessons in.\n\n269\n00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.910\nRemember we went over analogous colors and\ntriad colors and\n\n270\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.667\nsplit complementaries and everything,\nthere is a reason for that.\n\n271\n00:13:58.667 --> 00:14:01.490\n[LAUGH] It wasn't just for fun, it was to-\n>> It was fun.\n\n272\n00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:02.360\n>> It was fun, right?\n\n273\n00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.720\nIt's nice to know because that is the\nwhole idea about color theory in general,\n\n274\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.470\nbut it correlates into the colored\nguide panel in Illustrator.\n\n275\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.490\nSo if I've got this right here.\n\n276\n00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.280\nThis is going to be my base color.\n\n277\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.970\nAnd a lot of those color\ncombinations that we are describing\n\n278\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:26.454\ndid mention the base color as\nwhat it's basing off of itself.\n\n279\n00:14:26.454 --> 00:14:30.200\n[LAUGH] So I've got blue as my base color,\nor whatever this is.\n\n280\n00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.299\nAnd if i drop this down, you can see\nthat I have things like complementary,\n\n281\n00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:40.090\nsplit complementary, my analogous and\nit's going to give me,\n\n282\n00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.590\nwhen i choose that,\ndifferent color combinations.\n\n283\n00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:49.230\nI choose analogous two, look at all\nthese cool shades of bluish greens.\n\n284\n00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.210\nAnd if I go to my complementary.\n\n285\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.770\nSee now you've got the blue and orangey\ncolors going there because that's what it\n\n286\n00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.650\nmeans to be a complementary color and\nso on and so forth.\n\n287\n00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.800\nThe triad and, [COUGH] excuse me, and\nthe tetrads and things like that.\n\n288\n00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.090\n>> Very nice, so I don't have to break out\nmy color wheel and try to figure out what\n\n289\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.980\nthe complementary colors are,\nI can go right there in Illustrator.\n\n290\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.640\n>> Correct.\n\n291\n00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.551\nAnd it's always nice to kind of\nknow what these colors are doing.\n\n292\n00:15:15.551 --> 00:15:16.495\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like to me,\n\n293\n00:15:16.495 --> 00:15:17.989\nit's like those just look so\npretty together.\n\n294\n00:15:17.989 --> 00:15:19.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like that.\n\n295\n00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.610\nAnd so maybe if I like these kind\nof brighter colorful colors,\n\n296\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.030\nI can then pick from them.\n\n297\n00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:29.800\nAnd then I can use them to\napply to different objects.\n\n298\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.230\nNot that I really wanna change\nthis orange on this file, but\n\n299\n00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.210\nif I wanted to say here and I wanna\nmake that green, then I just click here.\n\n300\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:37.980\nI click there.\n\n301\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.570\nI click there.\n\n302\n00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:44.170\nSo I can apply colors from\nthe color guide to my document.\n\n303\n00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.220\nSo that's kind of fun.\n\n304\n00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.520\nAnd the other thing that is good\nto know about this color guide,\n\n305\n00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.900\nis like once I get.\n\n306\n00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.935\nYou see how this right here,\nthe base has changed?\n\n307\n00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:54.720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's because I'm clicking around.\n\n308\n00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.890\nAnd I I was doing here,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n309\n00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:03.240\nWhen I get to this, and I don't want\nblue to be the base color anymore,\n\n310\n00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.065\nlet me give one more demonstration.\n\n311\n00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:10.711\nSee how blue is the very first color\nin all of these different rules?\n\n312\n00:16:10.711 --> 00:16:13.103\nI want purple to be the base.\n\n313\n00:16:13.103 --> 00:16:20.020\nSo, all I've got to do is click right\nthere to set the base as that color.\n\n314\n00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:25.290\nAnd you can see now all\nof the color rules,\n\n315\n00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.640\nharmony rules are going to\nshow purple as the base.\n\n316\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.710\nSo it's lots of fun, lots of mixing and\nlots of different ways.\n\n317\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.380\nSo it's kind of like, hm, I don't\nknow what colors look good together.\n\n318\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.410\nWell, Illustrator can help you with\nthe whole idea of color theory.\n\n319\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.490\nIn the Color Guide,\njust a few more little things.\n\n320\n00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.940\nRemember the warm and\ncool that we were doing?\n\n321\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.020\nYou can have the base and\nthen has the spectrum or\n\n322\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.170\nthe variations on warm and cool.\n\n323\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.660\nYou also can go to vivid and\n\n324\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.440\nmuted, just different ways of how\nit's going to display the colors.\n\n325\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.860\nTints and Shades, remember tints being\nadd white, shades being add black.\n\n326\n00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.370\nAnd then, you can go into how many steps,\n\n327\n00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:11.255\nhow many variations from the middle so\nyou can do it It's four to the left and\n\n328\n00:17:11.255 --> 00:17:14.710\nfour to the right,\nyou can bump that up if you wanted and\n\n329\n00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:20.850\nyou can then have even more steps in\nbetween the colors that you can pick from.\n\n330\n00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.710\n>> Very cool\n>> Yes, very nice.\n\n331\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.910\nNow the last one that we can go to,\n\n332\n00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.863\none of the last panels that we can go to\nstart talking about or getting colors\n\n333\n00:17:29.863 --> 00:17:34.600\nthat we want to use in our Illustrator\ndocuments, is the color themes.\n\n334\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.520\nAnd this goes out to an external\nwebsite for the Adobe Color.\n\n335\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.680\nIt used to be called the Kuler,\nthe K-U-L-E-R dot com, but\n\n336\n00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.530\nnow they've decided to name\nit something different.\n\n337\n00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.970\nSo I'm just gonna show you that\nit actually brings me out and\n\n338\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:53.890\ntakes me to the color.adobe.com website to\nwhere I can go through all sorts of fun,\n\n339\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:54.820\nmixing of thing.\n\n340\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.710\nWell, I was trying to zoom out a little\nbit cuz I know the magnification on\n\n341\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.800\nthe screen's a little bit different.\n\n342\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.845\nAnd now I'm just kinda moving all over.\n\n343\n00:18:02.845 --> 00:18:05.970\n[LAUGH] But I'm trying to show you\nthat it's going to give you all\n\n344\n00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.190\nof the color values as you go.\n\n345\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.300\nAnd you can sit here and\ndo all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n346\n00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.540\nYou can start mixing different arms.\n\n347\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.790\nAnd you can change your\ndifferent analogous, or\n\n348\n00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:19.500\nmonochromatic, your different color\nrules here, and just go crazy.\n\n349\n00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.930\nI love doing this stuff, it's just\nendless amounts of color combinations.\n\n350\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.200\nYou could start making your custom ones,\nyou could start moving the arms around,\n\n351\n00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.770\nand be like ooh, that's so\npretty, it's great.\n\n352\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.810\nSo you can mix them here, but\neven better is that where you can\n\n353\n00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:39.002\nexplore other people's color\nthemes that they've chosen.\n\n354\n00:18:39.002 --> 00:18:44.730\nAnd it's like a community where you\nshare color combinations together,\n\n355\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.060\nand it's like I really like that.\n\n356\n00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.610\nAnd there's all sorts of different\nways that you can pick them,\n\n357\n00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:50.840\nyou can make your own.\n\n358\n00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.630\nYou can also save them into your\nMy Themes, which is tied to\n\n359\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:58.560\nyour Adobe CC Cloud subscription, and so\nyou can keep them all on this one website.\n\n360\n00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.760\nI was playing around and\n\n361\n00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.880\nI threw one in there just to show\nyou guys that I can do that.\n\n362\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:11.270\nSo, if I'm in here and I say,\nthis is awesome, I want this, all you have\n\n363\n00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:17.050\nto do is you can add that, you can save\nit, right up here, there's a Save button.\n\n364\n00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.360\nAnd if I save it, I can give it a name.\n\n365\n00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.290\nAnd you can see that I can save it\ninto my Creative Cloud Library.\n\n366\n00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:30.210\nI can also make it into my own theme,\nsorry that's actually what we're doing.\n\n367\n00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.060\nSo if I go like vonne 2 for fun.\n\n368\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.150\nNotice down here,\nyou could publish this theme to explorer.\n\n369\n00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.300\nThat's for if you want to share\nthis colour combination with others\n\n370\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.120\nit will go in to the explorer database for\neverybody else to see.\n\n371\n00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.910\nAnd if I click Save, and so where did\nit go, what did I do, that's fine.\n\n372\n00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.960\nIf I go back over to Illustrator,\nyou can see that in my\n\n373\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:59.100\nCreative Cloud Library there is\nthe theme that I just made right there.\n\n374\n00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.280\nI can go through, and I think it's\nactually behind my head there.\n\n375\n00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.270\nHere, let me pull the library out,\nthere we go.\n\n376\n00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.680\nSo you can see that I've got\nthe theme vonne 2 that I made and\n\n377\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.700\nthe theme2 or\nthat was the one I made before.\n\n378\n00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.010\nSo it's all right in here my library.\n\n379\n00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.894\nIt's kind of nice cuz then I can have\nall the different color combinations\n\n380\n00:20:19.894 --> 00:20:24.954\nthat I have created out in that\ncolor.adobe.com right here in my product.\n\n381\n00:20:24.954 --> 00:20:26.500\n>> Very cool, I like that.\n\n382\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.912\nSo the last place that I wanna show you\nwhere to pick colors is actually one of\n\n383\n00:20:29.912 --> 00:20:31.280\nyour favorites Mike.\n\n384\n00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.430\nSo I'll let you introduce\nthe next place we're going.\n\n385\n00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.930\n>> I bet this means this\nis the eyedropper tool.\n\n386\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.270\n>> It is, cuz you were talking\nabout it right before this episode.\n\n387\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.340\nAre we gonna do the eyedropper?\n\n388\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.250\nI was like, yes we are.\n\n389\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.295\nIt's like, I'm so excited I love\nthe eyedropper, I'm like, great.\n\n390\n00:20:44.295 --> 00:20:47.945\n>> Well before this episode that was\nthe one way I knew how to pick a color.\n\n391\n00:20:47.945 --> 00:20:49.190\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well hopefully I've shown you\n\n392\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.740\na few more since then.\n\n393\n00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.910\nBut yes, the eye dropper it sounds\nexactly like what it does, it's going to\n\n394\n00:20:55.910 --> 00:21:01.030\nactually drop over somewhere and actually\npick up whatever color you're over.\n\n395\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.800\nSo let's go over and find this, this is\na tool, so if not a panel like we've been\n\n396\n00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.990\ngoing over before but it does\ncorrespond to our panels like whatever\n\n397\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.890\nis in the color picker and whatever is\ngoing to be over here in a color panel.\n\n398\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.460\nSo I have my eye dropper\nwhich is hotkey of i,\n\n399\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.070\nand if I wanted to see what\nexactly is this color?\n\n400\n00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.640\nI can click on it, and\nthen that becomes the color\n\n401\n00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.310\nthat is in the field that's over here,\nand that's in the color panel there.\n\n402\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.450\nI can click here, and\n\n403\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.900\nthere, and it's just going to go\nahead and, that's the color I want.\n\n404\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.130\nNow, that's fine for\ncolors right here that I've been\n\n405\n00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.160\nactually creating in Illustrator,\nthese are vector objects that I made.\n\n406\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.240\nBut it can be used, I have down here,\nremember I have an image that's here.\n\n407\n00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.670\nAnd it can actually sample colors in the\nimage that you've placed within your file.\n\n408\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.140\nSo, more on images in other episodes.\n\n409\n00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.160\nSo, if I wanted to see, what is\nthat color, see it's picking there.\n\n410\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.520\nOr if I can go right here\nit's going to pick up,\n\n411\n00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.070\nnow remember watch over here on my\nscreen to where you can, see I've got\n\n412\n00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.745\nthat yellowish green and the pinks,\nwell that's not pink that's blue.\n\n413\n00:22:07.745 --> 00:22:09.200\n[LAUGH] And it'll just go ahead and\n\n414\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.870\nsample any of those colors that I'm\nclicking on and then I could take this and\n\n415\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:19.480\nthen use it to apply my fill or\ndraw squares and things like that.\n\n416\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.640\nSo there's another way you could\nuse this is let's go over here.\n\n417\n00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.920\nLet's say I wanted, I'm gonna go back\nto my black arrow tool to select.\n\n418\n00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.940\nI want to select these four squares so I'm\nShift+clicking to select these four items,\n\n419\n00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.830\nand I actually want them to\nbe the color of this green.\n\n420\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.780\nI want to sample that color and\napply it there.\n\n421\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.210\nSo, that's something you could do first,\n\n422\n00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.900\nis select the items that you\nwant to become that color.\n\n423\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.460\nYou come over to your eyedropper tool,\nyou then click on the thing that you want\n\n424\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.220\nthe color to be, and then it applies\nall of those things to be that color.\n\n425\n00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.140\nSo that's probably the way you\nwere doing it, a little bit?\n\n426\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:57.850\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n427\n00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:02.202\nThe little bit of work that I've done in\nhere has been working with somebody else's\n\n428\n00:23:02.202 --> 00:23:03.134\nstuff or files and\n\n429\n00:23:03.134 --> 00:23:06.941\nI needed to duplicate an exact color and\nthat was the easiest way to do it.\n\n430\n00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:10.233\n>> And that actually is the easiest way\nto do it, so you were doing it right.\n\n431\n00:23:10.233 --> 00:23:11.214\n>> Good [LAUGH].\n\n432\n00:23:11.214 --> 00:23:15.240\n>> But where we can find it in other\nplaces of course is always good to know.\n\n433\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.040\nSo, that is the eyedropper.\n\n434\n00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.770\nAnd now what we're going to go into next,\nin the next episode,\n\n435\n00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.610\nis we're going to go into swatches.\n\n436\n00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:26.590\nBecause we can do all this color picking\nthrough all these different places,\n\n437\n00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.550\nbut if I wanted to come back say,\ntomorrow, and\n\n438\n00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:35.140\nuse that same color that I\nhad found in this modality or\n\n439\n00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:40.380\nwhatever, and now I wanna use it again,\nthat's where we get into our swatches.\n\n440\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.410\nSo, that's going to be coming up next,\nand that's it.\n\n441\n00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.140\n>> All right, Vonne.\n\n442\n00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.200\nWell very good, great information there.\n\n443\n00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.110\nReally taking what we learned in the\nprevious episode about colors and color\n\n444\n00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:54.480\ntheory and seeing how we can apply that in\nmany different ways within Illustrator.\n\n445\n00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.980\nAll the different ways that we can go\nabout choosing the color we want to use\n\n446\n00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.010\nin our particular files.\n\n447\n00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.940\nSo we thank you for that, Vonne, we hope\neverybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n448\n00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.552\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n449\n00:24:04.552 --> 00:24:05.438\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n450\n00:24:05.438 --> 00:24:12.100\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:15.509\nhere at IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.881\nI'm your host MIke Rodrick and today we're\ndoing our Adobe illustrator CC 2015,\n\n5\n00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:25.900\nand specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at color swatches.\n\n6\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.840\nNow I've been told these are not\nthe swatches that we wore on our wrists\n\n7\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.890\nback in the day,\nit's something completely different.\n\n8\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.868\nSo here to help us figure out what\nthe heck they are is Miss Von Smith,\n\n9\n00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:35.824\nhow you doing, Von?\n\n10\n00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:39.120\nGreat, [LAUGH] wonderful\nold school reference there.\n\n11\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.780\n>> Date myself a little bit but\nI hear they're making a come back.\n\n12\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.160\n>> Yea and I totally knew\nwhat you were talking about,\n\n13\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.350\nbecause I had quite a few when\nI was in middle school as well.\n\n14\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.700\nSo.\n>> But not what we're hear to\n\n15\n00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.240\ntalk about, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.150\n>> Yes, we're not talking about watches\nhere we're actually talking about\n\n17\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.030\nswatches in Illustrator.\n\n18\n00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.510\nand what are swatches?\n\n19\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.380\nThey're ways that you can make colors and\n\n20\n00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.690\nbe able to quickly apply\nthem in your document.\n\n21\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.222\nWe're going to be talking\nabout how we can create them.\n\n22\n00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:08.760\nI'm gonna first, actually, show you the\nend result, go through the swatches panel,\n\n23\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.240\nshow you some files that\nalready have some swatches.\n\n24\n00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.810\nThen we'll go back and actually show\nhow we can make all those swatches.\n\n25\n00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.503\nTalk about libraries,\ntalk about It's about lots of fun stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:17.610\n>> Awesome.\n>> Yes.\n\n27\n00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.663\n>> Yeah, cuz you know you can,\nafter watching our other episodes you can\n\n28\n00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:23.713\ndo a lot of things with colors,\ncome up with a lot of custom colors, and\n\n29\n00:01:23.713 --> 00:01:27.179\nalthough fun, could be tedious if you had\nthe same project to work on for the same\n\n30\n00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.741\ncustomer over and over again, it'd be nice\nnot to have to make those every time.\n\n31\n00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:31.400\n>> Yes.\n\n32\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.250\nJust as you were saying I know\nyou have your favorite tool,\n\n33\n00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.750\nthe eye dropper tool where like hey I used\nthat color once, I wanna use it somewhere\n\n34\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.310\nelse but this is where, if you\ndidn't know about the eyedropper, or\n\n35\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.431\nmaybe it's a lot easier, really,\nif you just make swatches.\n\n36\n00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:44.721\n>> [INAUDIBLE] With the eyedropper,\n\n37\n00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.171\nI had to open up an old file that\nhad that color in it to go find it.\n\n38\n00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:48.460\nYeah, pain in and the but.\n\n39\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.040\n>> Yeah and so\nwe're gonna make some swatches.\n\n40\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.300\nAnd actually sharing\nswatches across files is.\n\n41\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.650\nIt's a trick.\n\n42\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.180\n>> Well.\n>> It's something that's\n\n43\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.410\nprobably not right there in front of you\nso I'm gonna tell you all about that so\n\n44\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.830\n>> I looking forward to it.\n\n45\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.520\n>> So let's go ahead and jump into them.\n\n46\n00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.199\nI actually have the file\nthat we had left off.\n\n47\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.200\nWith our color theory lessons, and\nwe were mixing all up our values.\n\n48\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.740\nSo I wanted to show you the swatches\npanel, because that's, of course,\n\n49\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.790\nwhere the swatches live, just like we have\nour color panel, and our color themes, and\n\n50\n00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.480\nthings like that.\n\n51\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.390\nSo here we go.\n\n52\n00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.220\nWe have our swatches.\n\n53\n00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.180\nWe have four different types\nof Swatches that you can have.\n\n54\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.050\nYou can have a solid swatch.\n\n55\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.830\nAnd you can see one's like this guy.\n\n56\n00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.780\nThat's a solid color.\n\n57\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.510\nAs opposed to one right here,\nthat's where we have a gradient swatch.\n\n58\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.990\nAnd how we can make gradients and\nmodify them, those are really fun.\n\n59\n00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.910\nSo, we'll get into that.\n\n60\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.940\nAnd we have a few other things that\nwe have in this particular document.\n\n61\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.260\nYou have Swatches that have a corner.\n\n62\n00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.700\nThat's not yellow that's white.\n\n63\n00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.750\nA white corner and\nthen one with a corner with a dot in it.\n\n64\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.530\nThe one that is solid what.\n\n65\n00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.300\nThat is known as a global swatch.\n\n66\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.260\nWe'll talk about what that actually means,\nand then we have the one with\n\n67\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.850\nthe dot in it and that is a spot\nswatch cause it's got a spot in it.\n\n68\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.510\nOkay so we're talking about our.\n\n69\n00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.280\nProcess colors or\nCMYK versus our Pantone spot colors,\n\n70\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.660\nthat's what indicates to us in our\nSwatches panel that that is a Spot Swatch.\n\n71\n00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.260\nThat is if used in a document,\n\n72\n00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.930\nit would show to a printer as\na Spot color not a Process color.\n\n73\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.430\nThen we have a few guys over\nhere those are Pattern Swatches.\n\n74\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.230\nPatterns, well kind of self explanatory.\n\n75\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.380\nIt's gonna make a patterned fill,\nor a patterned stroke, depending on\n\n76\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.490\nwhich place you apply it to for\nthat particular item that you're using.\n\n77\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.140\nAnd then, just one other thing that\nwe'll point out is, down below you have\n\n78\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.160\nthings that are indicated with\nthat looks like a little folder,\n\n79\n00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.780\nthose are known as Swatch groups,\nand why would you want to do that?\n\n80\n00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.690\nReally just for organizational purposes,\n\n81\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.750\nmaybe you have all the company\ncolors in one place?\n\n82\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.800\nOr I'm gonna use all of these colors in\njust this logo, it's really up to you how\n\n83\n00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.220\nyou want and why you wanna organize\nyour swatches into groups.\n\n84\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.470\nBut they can be very handy.\n\n85\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.600\nThey're almost like sub\nsets of the swatches panel.\n\n86\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.010\nAnd just a little note right now.\n\n87\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.390\nSo I'm thinking about\nit is when you use or\n\n88\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.410\ncreate swatch groups you can\nonly use them with Solid colors.\n\n89\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.510\nYou cannot use patterns and\ngradients in a swatch group.\n\n90\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.480\nJust throwing that out there.\n\n91\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.940\nAnd just like any panel\nyou have in Illustrator,\n\n92\n00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.140\nyou have your Panel Options button\nup in the top right-hand corner.\n\n93\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.630\nAnd I just wanna go over a few things.\n\n94\n00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.970\nWe'll be coming back to that a little bit\nlater when we talk about libraries and\n\n95\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:38.830\nthings like that.\n\n96\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.395\nBut if these icons, or the swatch in\nyour swatch panel are kind of small.\n\n97\n00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:46.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe for you, Mike.\n\n98\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.200\nYou might need to make them\na little bit bigger for you.\n\n99\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.790\n>> Please.\n[LAUGH]\n\n100\n00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.645\n>> Yeah, you got those old eyes.\n\n101\n00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:51.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n102\n00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.900\n>> You can use your view options here,\nyou can turn them into a large thumbnail.\n\n103\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.440\nThere you go.\n\n104\n00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.465\n>> Much better.\n>> That's for you.\n\n105\n00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:03.220\n[LAUGH] So you can them a little bit\nbigger there if you wanted to, or\n\n106\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.430\nyou can use a medium, or\nyou can actually use them in list view.\n\n107\n00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.170\nSo you can see, remember the different\nvalues that we can use to mix our colors,\n\n108\n00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.710\nthey can go ahead and display that way.\n\n109\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.970\nSo I might go ahead and throw them back\ninto the medium thumbnail view just so\n\n110\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.460\nwe can see it.\n\n111\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.550\nAnd maybe make my swatches\npanel bigger while explaining.\n\n112\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.200\nWe of course have the icons on\nthe bottom that will go over as well but\n\n113\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.810\nthat's just you know the same things that\nwe had in any panel in illustrator you\n\n114\n00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.380\nhave in the swatches panel.\n\n115\n00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.090\nSo, in this particular document you\ncan see I have these swatches but\n\n116\n00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.750\nlet's switch over to another file that\nwe're going to be working with today\n\n117\n00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.050\ncalled swatches start.\n\n118\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.110\nNotice you don't have the same\nswatches that you do over here.\n\n119\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.160\nThat's because swatches are document\nspecific, or file specific.\n\n120\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.930\nSo you're talking about, well, if I had\none file and had all these swatches,\n\n121\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.740\nwell what if I want to use those\nsame swatches in another file?\n\n122\n00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.010\n>> It's not gonna help me, is it?\n\n123\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.912\n>> Well, until I show you how.\n\n124\n00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:06.120\n>> Okay.\n>> Until I show you how, you can actually\n\n125\n00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.610\n>> Share out your swatches across\n\n126\n00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.910\ndocuments.\n\n127\n00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.920\nWe’ll get to there as well.\n\n128\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.720\n>> Patience is not one of my virtues.\n\n129\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.340\n>> No it’s not but that's okay.\n\n130\n00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.360\nYou go me here so.\n\n131\n00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.420\nOK so I just wanted to point that out so\nlet’s start back here\n\n132\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.528\nwhere I was at starches starches swatch\n>> Starches\n\n133\n00:06:24.528 --> 00:06:27.110\n>> [LAUGH] We'll try that again,\n\n134\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.670\nhow about swatches start.\n\n135\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.440\nAll right, we went over the color\npicker in our other episodes, by double\n\n136\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.520\nclicking in the foreground color,\nwe went over to our color panel, where\n\n137\n00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.070\nwe can mix our colors with our sliders,\nand we went over our color guides.\n\n138\n00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.570\nAll of these places is where\nyou can mix a color and\n\n139\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.240\nthen you can\n>> Add into your swatches.\n\n140\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.480\nNow this file is an RGB, just to show\nyou that it is in the RGB color mode.\n\n141\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.810\nSo by default it was going to give\nme the RGB sliders, which is fine.\n\n142\n00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.820\nSo let's just come over here and say I\nwant this like, I don't know, that color.\n\n143\n00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.640\nThat sounds good.\n\n144\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.500\nright?\n\n145\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.410\nOr if I could type in the values.\n\n146\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.990\nNow, I could from the color panel\ngo up to the panel options button\n\n147\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.160\nin the color panel and\ngo right here to create a new swatch.\n\n148\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.610\nOkay because of course it's always tied\nif I'm over here in the color panel or\n\n149\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.610\nover here in the color clicker it's\nalways going to be there's the color.\n\n150\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.160\nSo that's one way you can do it.\n\n151\n00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.880\nOr you can come down to\nyour swatches panel.\n\n152\n00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.200\nBecause you know, you're making a swatch.\n\n153\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.430\nYou can go here and\nyou could do the same thing, new swatch.\n\n154\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.600\nBecause that is the current color\nthat you have up and ready to go.\n\n155\n00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.220\nSo either way you wanna do it,\nthat's fine.\n\n156\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.470\nSo I'm gonna, since I'm still here,\nlet's go with new swatch.\n\n157\n00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.790\nAnd now you can see in\nthe new swatch dialogue box.\n\n158\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.530\nIt has given me whatever I had\nIn the color that I was mixing.\n\n159\n00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.316\nAnd it's going to ask me,\nwhat do you wanna name it?\n\n160\n00:07:48.316 --> 00:07:52.763\nNow if I don't do anything, it's just\ngonna keep the numerical value and\n\n161\n00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:53.695\nthat's fine or\n\n162\n00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:58.160\nI could say like my blue cuz I can't\nthink of anything else to put in there.\n\n163\n00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.540\nNow we're in a RGB color mode, so\n\n164\n00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.800\nwe're more than likely going\nto be designing for screens.\n\n165\n00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.380\nSo the process versus spot in this\nparticular Instance doesn't really matter,\n\n166\n00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.000\nbecause we're mixing screen colors.\n\n167\n00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.750\nWe're not mixing print and process colors,\nso keep it at a default there.\n\n168\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.510\nAnd then I do want it to be\nin an RGB color mode, but\n\n169\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.330\nyou notice you do have\ndifferent options here.\n\n170\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.120\nSo if I were mixing a color and\nit's showing up as RGB but\n\n171\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.230\nI was in a CMYK file, I can switch it to\nmake sure it seem like a color modes.\n\n172\n00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.990\nAnyway, just remember, you do want to file\nfor web, you do want to file for print.\n\n173\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.509\nAnd if you do that in a file new,\n\n174\n00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:44.180\nit's going to keep those particular advice\nof whatever media that you're working in.\n\n175\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.990\nSo we're going to keep that there,\nand we're good.\n\n176\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.400\nWe could add it to\na library if I wanted to\n\n177\n00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.230\nmake sure that all my\nswatches go into My LibrARY.\n\n178\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.380\nAnd that's where another place\nyou can kind of exchange them.\n\n179\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.930\nI'm gonna uncheck that for now and just\nto show you a demonstration purposes for\n\n180\n00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.500\ndoing swatch libraries later.\n\n181\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.270\nAll right.\nAnd then there you go, there's my swatch.\n\n182\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.380\nIt's right there in my library.\n\n183\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.541\nSorry it's not my library,\nit's in my swatches panel.\n\n184\n00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.364\nIf I have it doesn't\nshow in the zoom mode.\n\n185\n00:09:10.364 --> 00:09:13.870\nIt will give me the name of my swatch,\nwhich is my blue.\n\n186\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.860\nAnd there you go.\n\n187\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.250\nSo you can mix colors all day long.\n\n188\n00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.040\nI come over here and\nmaybe go ahead and do that again.\n\n189\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.020\nLet me make a new swatch.\n\n190\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.150\nI'll go with pink.\n\n191\n00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:29.690\nJust gonna get a couple in there so\nyou can see the swatches I want.\n\n192\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.200\nNow that is where we got\nsolid swatches groups, right?\n\n193\n00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.170\nI've already pointed that out.\n\n194\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.930\nYou can make your own groups, but\nI wanna do almost like a shortcut,\n\n195\n00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:42.980\na quicker way to do it.\n\n196\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.204\nBecause you can go to the color guide.\n\n197\n00:09:45.204 --> 00:09:49.335\nRemember that when we were\nshowing of our different color,\n\n198\n00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:53.020\ncomplimentary colors or\ncolor theories or harmonies.\n\n199\n00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.990\nThat's what we were trying to go with,\nharmony rules.\n\n200\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.540\nI should go up to the top where\nit actually tells me what we're\n\n201\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.060\ntalking about.\n\n202\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.660\nSo if I want these,\nI really like this group of colors.\n\n203\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.540\nWell the cool thing here is that if I\ngo down to this button at the bottom,\n\n204\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.180\nthat Is add to the swatches.\n\n205\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.570\nI was trying to get the preview to pop up.\n\n206\n00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.260\nThere we go.\n\n207\n00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.210\nSave color group to swatch panels.\n\n208\n00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.860\nI click that button.\n\n209\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.580\nWell, did it work?\n\n210\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.650\nDon't click it more than once, okay?\n\n211\n00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Because you're just get a whole\n\n212\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.350\nbunch of groups.\n\n213\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.170\nAnd you can see right there in my\nswatches panel, it's like, ooh.\n\n214\n00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.023\nI got all of these to\nbe able to choose from.\n\n215\n00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:24.630\n>> Nice.\n\n216\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.440\n>> So I love that.\n\n217\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.380\nI love using the color guide.\n\n218\n00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.430\nAnd maybe changing the base,\nmaybe I'll make this green.\n\n219\n00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.390\nAnd then, I'll come down here and\nbe like, I really like these colors.\n\n220\n00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.140\nAnd then I just keep on adding and\nadding and adding.\n\n221\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.380\nAnd it's a really quick and\neasy way, I think,\n\n222\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.280\nto just get a whole bunch of solid\ncolors all together in one place.\n\n223\n00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.780\n>> Very nice.\n>> Which is fantastic.\n\n224\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.950\nSo since we're still on those\ncolor groups, let me show you how.\n\n225\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.210\nWell maybe, I have some swatches\nalready made whether I did them or\n\n226\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.610\nthey came with the document that I would\nlike to organize into my own group.\n\n227\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.040\nSo from here you can go\nto the new color group,\n\n228\n00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.120\nthat icon down at the bottom\nof the swatches panel.\n\n229\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.840\nYou make a new group and\nI can just name it.\n\n230\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.240\nI'm just naming it Vahn for fun, and\nwhy did it pull that first color in?\n\n231\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.520\nYou see how it actually has that green-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n232\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.140\n>> As the first color?\n\n233\n00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.590\nThat's because that's the color\nthat I have already mixed, and\n\n234\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.520\nready to go in the swatches panel.\n\n235\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.900\nSo, it just found that, and\nsaid, here, let me go ahead and\n\n236\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.820\nmake a new group off of that.\n\n237\n00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.580\n>> Hm.\n\n238\n00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.150\n>> Okay, so that if wanted to have,\nmaybe, this green in that group.\n\n239\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.400\nAll you got to do is just drag and\ndrop it.\n\n240\n00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.740\nYou see there's a little blue\nline that pops up right there.\n\n241\n00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.970\nBut you know that you're going\nto be adding to this group.\n\n242\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.170\nJust drop it in and there we go.\n\n243\n00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:46.300\nMaybe I want to throw in that green,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n244\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.450\nYou can mix however many Swatches\nwithin a group that you want.\n\n245\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.690\nAnd go from there.\n\n246\n00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.730\nSo, that's lots of fun to organize\nyour swatches into groups.\n\n247\n00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.440\nOkay, so now that we have some great\nswatches already mixed together,\n\n248\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.620\nlet's apply some swatches here.\n\n249\n00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:07.600\nBecause the next thing I wanna\nshow you is how and why and what.\n\n250\n00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.150\nAll the W's of global swatches.\n\n251\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.200\nOkay, so let's go ahead, and\nI'm just gonna select a square.\n\n252\n00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.530\nAnd notice I have my fill here, and\nI'll just start clicking on some colors.\n\n253\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.930\nAnd I'll apply here.\n\n254\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.210\nOne thing I could point out as well is\nthat anything you have in the swatches\n\n255\n00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.230\npanel is gonna show up\nfrom the Tool Options bar.\n\n256\n00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.050\nBecause it's the same thing whether or\nnot you wanna apply from here, like I have\n\n257\n00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.570\nthe square selected I'm going to go ahead\nand select the fill and or the stroke.\n\n258\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.190\nIt's all going to.\n\n259\n00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.570\nI don't know why it just did that.\n\n260\n00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.760\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH] I think with the resolution that\n\n261\n00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.040\ncan change the stroke as well.\n\n262\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.240\nIt all mirrors each other whether\nyou go from the swatches panel or\n\n263\n00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.715\nfrom the tool options bar.\n\n264\n00:12:45.715 --> 00:12:50.360\nOkay, so I got a couple going on here and\nmaybe I'll do, I'm going to shift.\n\n265\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.360\nClick and select a couple of them and\napply this blue swatch here.\n\n266\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.797\nNow, I have quite a few things\non here that applied blue fill,\n\n267\n00:13:00.797 --> 00:13:04.891\nand I realize that is not\nthe right color blue.\n\n268\n00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:10.143\nMaybe I want it to be more purple, but\nits all the way through my document,\n\n269\n00:13:10.143 --> 00:13:14.406\nnow I could go through and\nselect all the different pieces.\n\n270\n00:13:14.406 --> 00:13:18.521\nOr use the cool select menu that we\ntalked about, select same fill, and\n\n271\n00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:19.618\nthen apply it, but\n\n272\n00:13:19.618 --> 00:13:24.860\nthere is another way that you could do\nit and that's using global swatches.\n\n273\n00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.590\nSo a global swatch is where anything that\n\n274\n00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:34.240\nis having that swatch applied to it,\neither in like a fill or a strip capacity.\n\n275\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.070\nIf you go back to the source,\n\n276\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.100\nactually the swatch itself,\nchange the values in the swatch.\n\n277\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.730\nIt's gonna automatically push\nout all those changes to any\n\n278\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.330\nitem that has that global swatch.\n\n279\n00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.330\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n280\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.740\n>> Yes, it is.\n>> Yeah, it really is,\n\n281\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:53.080\nbut let me demonstrate here,\nin a non-global capacity.\n\n282\n00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.720\nThe swatch options.\n\n283\n00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.740\nSo I've got the blue.\n\n284\n00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.210\nIf I double-click on this blue swatch,\n\n285\n00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.470\ncuz that is how you can get\ninto any swatch options.\n\n286\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.910\nAnd I can come into here,\nand say, all right.\n\n287\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.550\nWell, I'd really like to make\nthis like this more purple color.\n\n288\n00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.210\nAnd I click okay.\n\n289\n00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.790\nWell that's great, changes the swatch.\n\n290\n00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.930\nBut it doesn't do anything to the items\nthat had that original swatch applied to.\n\n291\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:19.060\nSo, doesn't really help me in\nthe sense of where I want to go,\n\n292\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.610\nto where I wanna change that blue.\n\n293\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.660\nSo, let's go back to this option again.\n\n294\n00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.380\nAnd I'm gonna change this swatch\nto a global swatch, okay?\n\n295\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:34.880\nAnd I'm gonna say new purple,\neven though well it's blue purple.\n\n296\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.980\nAnyways we got purple okay?\n\n297\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.020\nAnd I click okay.\n\n298\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.420\nNotice there it's got that little,\nooh, there it is.\n\n299\n00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.900\nLittle white triangle so\nit's a global swatch.\n\n300\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.610\nSo if I come back and\nselect all the items, apply that\n\n301\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.510\npurple global swatch to it, click off it\nso you can see that nothing is selected.\n\n302\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:58.170\nGo back to the swatch options, change this\nto maybe a little bit lighter purple.\n\n303\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.170\nMaybe throw a little blue,\nactually green, in there.\n\n304\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.940\nThey go into there and you click okay.\n\n305\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.940\nWatch the changes on the document.\n\n306\n00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.370\nYou can see that all of the purple\nis now a little bit lighter.\n\n307\n00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:09.883\n>> Handy.\n\n308\n00:15:09.883 --> 00:15:11.340\n>> Yes.\n>> Now that can be really useful.\n\n309\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.570\nYou've been working on a project,\nyou're way in to it.\n\n310\n00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.830\nCustomer comes in and says you\nknow that blue is not quite right.\n\n311\n00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.520\nYou got to go back and find every place\nyou've used that blue and change it or\n\n312\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.566\nyou can use a swatch.\n\n313\n00:15:23.566 --> 00:15:27.260\n>> Exactly.\nYou do have to do a little prior planning.\n\n314\n00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:27.820\nYeah.\n\n315\n00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.430\nJust make everything\nglobal if you wanted to.\n\n316\n00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.990\nAnd that way just in case that ever\nhappens then you're all ready there.\n\n317\n00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.760\nBecause as you saw I had to go back and\napply that global swatch to those\n\n318\n00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.140\nitems for it to then like, I see,\nyou're unconnected to that swatch now.\n\n319\n00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.020\nNow if you change the options it\nwill go ahead and update itself.\n\n320\n00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.910\n>> So\nchanging that swatch to a global swatch\n\n321\n00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.160\n>> After the fact isn't going to help you.\n\n322\n00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:51.950\n>> Correct.\n\n323\n00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.286\nOkay, wonderful.\n\n324\n00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:56.359\nSo got a few types of\nswatches already covered.\n\n325\n00:15:56.359 --> 00:15:57.743\nWe're going to move on to gradients.\n\n326\n00:15:57.743 --> 00:15:59.393\nI love me a gradient, okay?\n\n327\n00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:02.768\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just love them, so let's talk about\n\n328\n00:16:02.768 --> 00:16:08.351\nthe existing ones and then we'll make\nour own and have a lot of fun with that.\n\n329\n00:16:08.351 --> 00:16:13.781\nSo, [COUGH] quite a few different ways\nthat you could modify a gradient.\n\n330\n00:16:13.781 --> 00:16:16.780\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nuse this square right here.\n\n331\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.800\nI'm just gonna zoom in so\nyou can see it a little bit better.\n\n332\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.460\nAnd I'm gonna use this\nsky fill that is here.\n\n333\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.100\nThat is just blue to white.\n\n334\n00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:32.140\nNow gradient means that you have colors\nthat kind of blend together across a line,\n\n335\n00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.900\nif you wanna say, or a radial.\n\n336\n00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.300\nWhich I'll show you.\n\n337\n00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.560\nSo I've got this selected.\n\n338\n00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.670\nI'm gonna go over to my\nGradient panel first,\n\n339\n00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:45.990\nbecause this is one way that you\ncan modify a gradient, okay?\n\n340\n00:16:47.292 --> 00:16:49.280\nYeah, there,\nit was behind my head, wasn't it?\n\n341\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.800\n[LAUGH] There we go, so now you guys\ncan see it a little bit better.\n\n342\n00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.720\nSo this is a linear gradient.\n\n343\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.290\nMeaning that it goes in a line,\n\n344\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.190\nyou can see from this white\nall the way over to blue.\n\n345\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:03.330\nAnd along this line you\nhave different stops.\n\n346\n00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.660\nYou can see that there are these little\nhouses on the bottom of the Gradient Ramp.\n\n347\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.249\nI don't know if they're\nreally called houses.\n\n348\n00:17:09.249 --> 00:17:11.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I call them houses cuz they look like\n\n349\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:12.516\nhouses.\n\n350\n00:17:12.516 --> 00:17:14.400\nBut they do call it a Gradient Ramp.\n\n351\n00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.170\nAnd then they have the ways\nit blends in between\n\n352\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.390\nthose stops along the top\nof those diamonds.\n\n353\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.326\nNow all of this can be moved, modified,\ntaken off, added to, so on, and so\n\n354\n00:17:25.326 --> 00:17:26.999\nforth, which we'll get into.\n\n355\n00:17:26.999 --> 00:17:32.650\nBut, let's go to the top here and start\nwith what the difference type we have.\n\n356\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.250\nWe have a lineal gradient and\nwe have a radial.\n\n357\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.790\nI think you can probably figure\nout that radial means circle.\n\n358\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.190\nSo this is where it is going from\nthe center out versus a line.\n\n359\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.800\nAnd then we have a few other things,\nyou have the angle of the circle.\n\n360\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.320\nNow, right now,\n\n361\n00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.930\nsince it's a perfect circle it's not\ngonna make any difference is it?\n\n362\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:52.480\nNo.\n\n363\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.505\nIf this was a linear, you could see that\nI start changing the angle, it's gonna\n\n364\n00:17:57.505 --> 00:18:02.758\nstart twisting is gonna be, well, what\nare we at 120, and so on, and so forth.\n\n365\n00:18:02.758 --> 00:18:03.533\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n366\n00:18:03.533 --> 00:18:08.033\n>> If I change it to a radio,\nthe only time that this degree, or\n\n367\n00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:13.902\nthe angle is going to matter, is if we\nactually change the size of the radial.\n\n368\n00:18:13.902 --> 00:18:19.080\nSo, if you see, if I make this 50%,\nnow it's not a perfect circle.\n\n369\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.620\nSo now, the angle will actually change.\n\n370\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.787\nIt almost looks like a galaxy, right?\n\n371\n00:18:24.787 --> 00:18:25.721\n>> [LAUGH] It does.\n\n372\n00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:27.870\n>> So\nyou could see it's changing that way.\n\n373\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.670\nYou also have this little\nbutton over here on the side.\n\n374\n00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.070\nTo where you can flip it, because it's\ngoing from the white is in the middle and\n\n375\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.890\nthe blue is on the outside.\n\n376\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.890\nIf I flip it, then it's,\nwell, the reverse.\n\n377\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.180\nThe blue is on the inside and\nthe white is on the outside, and\n\n378\n00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.270\nyou can see it changing\non the Gradient Ramp.\n\n379\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:49.230\nSo, all of those different buttons,\nlet's go over now changing the colors.\n\n380\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.690\nI'm gonna stick with the linear,\n\n381\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.970\nnon angle gradient to go with because\nI like the white to the blue,\n\n382\n00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.060\nbut maybe I want it to go green\nin-between or something like that.\n\n383\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.990\nYou take these gradient stops,\nI think that's the technical name,\n\n384\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.450\neven if they still look like houses.\n\n385\n00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.420\nAnd if you click on the house,\n\n386\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:13.460\nnotice that you know this is\nthe correct house or gradient stop that\n\n387\n00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.780\nyou have selected because the roof\nturns black, as I call it.\n\n388\n00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.370\nThe triangle turns to black instead of\nit being white, when it is not selected.\n\n389\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.210\nSo, if I have this stop,\nyou could change the opacity and location.\n\n390\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.090\nI'd rather just drag it,\nsee I can move it left to right.\n\n391\n00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.597\nOr, if I wanted to change the color\nyou just double-click it.\n\n392\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.350\nIt actually brings up the panel to\nwhere you can change your colors.\n\n393\n00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.446\nMaybe I did want it to be\na little bit more green.\n\n394\n00:19:38.446 --> 00:19:39.708\nNow, these are the sliders, right?\n\n395\n00:19:39.708 --> 00:19:42.520\nBut I had a specific\ngreen that I had mixed.\n\n396\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.177\nWell, that's because here over here\non the corner, that's not the corner,\n\n397\n00:19:45.177 --> 00:19:45.832\nthat's the side.\n\n398\n00:19:45.832 --> 00:19:51.207\nThe side is where you could choose that\nI want the stops to show by my swatches,\n\n399\n00:19:51.207 --> 00:19:57.040\nnot by my color mixer, so good reason why\nwe have all our swatches ready to go.\n\n400\n00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.900\nAnd then I can change that\ngradient stop to green and\n\n401\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.880\nnow you can see I've got\nthe white to green to blue.\n\n402\n00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.040\nI can move these houses around so\n\n403\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.890\nI could do all sorts of different\nfun color combinations.\n\n404\n00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:13.520\nBut maybe I don't really like this\nblue here anymore, this second house.\n\n405\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.460\nIf you don't like the house, you just\npull it off the ramp, as I call it.\n\n406\n00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.980\nYou grab it, and you drag it.\n\n407\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.200\nAnd then you let go.\n\n408\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.170\nIf you drag drop,\nyou can pull stops off the Gradient Ramp.\n\n409\n00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.110\nSame way that if you wanted to add,\n\n410\n00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.080\nyou can see that, it's kind of\nprobably hard to see with my mouse.\n\n411\n00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.860\nCuz it's not gonna show up.\n\n412\n00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.150\nBut it actually has like a little plus\nsign next to my mouse of where you just\n\n413\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.300\nclick it just adds a house\non that Gradient Ramp and\n\n414\n00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.040\nthem you can go through and\nyou can change the colors.\n\n415\n00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.940\nOkay, now we're getting a little crazy\nwith the color combinations that I\n\n416\n00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.549\ngot going on but\nthat's how you can modify your gradients\n\n417\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.260\non the Gradient Ramp in the Gradient\npanel to whatever you want it to be.\n\n418\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.738\nAnd so I've got this beautiful weird\nrainbow looking thing right now.\n\n419\n00:20:56.738 --> 00:20:58.525\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've mixed my gradient.\n\n420\n00:20:58.525 --> 00:21:02.711\nYou can see that it's the color in my fill\nover here it's the color of the fill in\n\n421\n00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:04.530\nthe item I have selected.\n\n422\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.470\nIf I want that to become a swatch, for\n\n423\n00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.620\nme to be able to use this gradient later,\ndown the road.\n\n424\n00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.720\nSo, same way that we did it before.\n\n425\n00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:20.610\nYou you can go to the Swatches panel and\nthen you can go to New Swatch right there.\n\n426\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.420\nYou can see that it's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n427\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.575\nIt's not doing the sliders\ncause it's not a solid color,\n\n428\n00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:27.980\nit knows that you have a gradient\nselected that it's wanting to add.\n\n429\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.222\nAnd we can just name this, Crazy Rainbow.\n\n430\n00:21:32.222 --> 00:21:36.430\nAnd you didn't have to name it, but I'm\ngoing to, you click OK, and there it goes.\n\n431\n00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.770\nAnd there's my gradient\nswatch in my Swatches panel.\n\n432\n00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.510\n>> That's pretty neat, and not that hard.\n\n433\n00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.370\n>> No, not hard at all.\n\n434\n00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.690\nNow I was showing you how you could modify\n\n435\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:53.350\nthe gradient in the Gradient panel cuz\nthat is the one place that you can do it,\n\n436\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.730\nor you have the Gradient tool, okay.\n\n437\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.750\nThe Gradient tool is right here, okay.\n\n438\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:04.050\nAnd notice that I still have the item that\nI wanted to modify selected first, so\n\n439\n00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.830\nalways that select to effect,\nso I've got that going.\n\n440\n00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:10.216\nAnd it's gonna show me\nthe Gradient Ramp right on the item,\n\n441\n00:22:10.216 --> 00:22:14.018\nwhich is to me super cool,\nyou can actually see where it's going.\n\n442\n00:22:14.018 --> 00:22:14.970\n>> That is cool.\n\n443\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.715\n>> Yeah, and now what you can\ndo with the Gradient tool,\n\n444\n00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:20.140\nis you can still modify it the same way.\n\n445\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.600\nYou could, instead of changing the angle,\nyou can just draw it.\n\n446\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.539\nAnd you can draw the length of how and\n\n447\n00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:29.650\nwhere you want the gradient\nto apply within that object.\n\n448\n00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.952\nSo I just, doesn't matter where,\nI'm just gonna click hold and drag.\n\n449\n00:22:32.952 --> 00:22:34.800\nI'm gonna drag across,\nand I'm going to let go.\n\n450\n00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.227\nAnd you see how wherever I\nactually drew that line,\n\n451\n00:22:37.227 --> 00:22:39.140\nthe gradient is going to follow.\n\n452\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.290\nI can make even wider than\nthe item that it has.\n\n453\n00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.630\nIt's only showing part of the gradient.\n\n454\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.250\nI can make it super small.\n\n455\n00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.330\nLike that, and I can just keep on,\njust click, hold, and\n\n456\n00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.200\ndrag, and I can drag this gradient\nto wherever I want to be.\n\n457\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.095\nYou can then afterwards, you can click the\none end and you can shorten it this way,\n\n458\n00:22:55.095 --> 00:22:58.426\nyou could also take the other end and\nyou can kind of move it up and down,\n\n459\n00:22:58.426 --> 00:23:01.720\nwhich doesn't really matter\nsince it's a linear gradient.\n\n460\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.920\nBut really just click, hold, and drag and\nyou can reapply that gradient and\n\n461\n00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.060\nhowever you want.\n\n462\n00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.950\nYou can double-click on the houses,\njust like we did before.\n\n463\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:14.220\nYou can add the houses, you can pull\nthe houses off, all the same stuff.\n\n464\n00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.860\nThat's not very pretty.\n\n465\n00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.130\nBlue to orange in a gradient\ndoesn't look so good.\n\n466\n00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.170\nLet's throw that white in the middle.\n\n467\n00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.036\nThere we go,\nthat's a little bit better, okay.\n\n468\n00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:22.900\nAnd now I've got a new gradient.\n\n469\n00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.400\nRight, I took that green stop\noff the Gradient Ramp so\n\n470\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.210\nI can come back over here and\nadd a new swatch.\n\n471\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.135\nAnd see, I have a new variation of my\nswatch from the Gradient tool rather\n\n472\n00:23:34.135 --> 00:23:35.929\nthan the Gradient panel.\n\n473\n00:23:35.929 --> 00:23:36.518\n>> Wow.\n\n474\n00:23:36.518 --> 00:23:37.600\n>> So, super fun.\n\n475\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.620\n>> Just two different ways\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n476\n00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.550\nIt really just depends\non which way you go.\n\n477\n00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:46.301\nBut it is good to know because on a lot of\nyour test questions on either the ACE or\n\n478\n00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:49.750\nthe ACA, it will ask you for\ncertain things and\n\n479\n00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.484\nyou do need to know where\nit is in Multiple places.\n\n480\n00:23:53.484 --> 00:23:57.080\nSo it's just always good\nto know all the angles.\n\n481\n00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.360\n>> Very good,\nyou really do like gradients don't you?\n\n482\n00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.910\n>> I do.\nI love them.\n\n483\n00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.160\nI love colors.\n\n484\n00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.680\nAnd anything that blends together,\nand kind of looks like rainbows.\n\n485\n00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n486\n00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.830\n>> Any variation on rainbows is awesome.\n\n487\n00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.170\n>> All right, so\nwhat do you have for us next?\n\n488\n00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.416\n>> Well we went over,\nwhat's the one thing we didn't go over?\n\n489\n00:24:16.416 --> 00:24:20.630\nWe went over-\n>> Spot swatches, I don't think we hit or\n\n490\n00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:21.660\npattern swatches.\n\n491\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.370\n>> Let's move onto pattern.\n\n492\n00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.180\n>> I like it.\n>> Because the spots are in a special\n\n493\n00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.614\nplace that I want to keep\nyou all in suspense about.\n\n494\n00:24:29.614 --> 00:24:31.028\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n495\n00:24:31.028 --> 00:24:34.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> So patterns, patterns are fun.\n\n496\n00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.060\nWe can start over here.\n\n497\n00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:41.120\nI'm gonna go ahead and apply an already\nexisting pattern swatch, so you can see.\n\n498\n00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.380\nGot the square selected, and\nI'm going to use this Alyssa, there we go.\n\n499\n00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.260\nThat's crazy.\n\n500\n00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.310\nMaybe this other one, that's nice too.\n\n501\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.820\nNice?\n\n502\n00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.675\nThat's nice.\n\n503\n00:24:50.675 --> 00:24:52.150\n[LAUGH] Our jive pattern.\n\n504\n00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:53.940\nSo fun, right?\n\n505\n00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.920\nI can go ahead and apply it.\n\n506\n00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.280\nYou're like well,\nwhat about making my own, or\n\n507\n00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.620\nare these the only pattern Watch\nas I have available to me.\n\n508\n00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:08.070\nNo, you have more already configured or\npredetermined swatches in your library.\n\n509\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.010\nWhich I know I've said quite a few times,\nyou know like,\n\n510\n00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.460\njust show me it I'm getting there.\n\n511\n00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.200\nBut I want to show you how you\ncan make your own pattern and\n\n512\n00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.260\nhow to edit existing ones.\n\n513\n00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.350\nSo just like we had with any other swatch,\n\n514\n00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.660\nyou could get into other swatch options\njust by double clicking that swatch right?\n\n515\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.120\nYou can do the same thing\nwith the pattern, but\n\n516\n00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.240\nit does take you somewhere\ncompletely different.\n\n517\n00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.670\nIt takes you to the pattern editor.\n\n518\n00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.850\nSo I'm gonna double click\non this jive pattern and\n\n519\n00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.900\nnotice I am in a totally\ndifferently place.\n\n520\n00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.750\nWhere did my document go?\n\n521\n00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.410\nAlways, whoops sorry.\n\n522\n00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:39.870\nLet me get back in there.\n\n523\n00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.800\nI did undo instead of my zoom,\nsorry wrong key.\n\n524\n00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.740\nSo you can see that up Here,\nI'm actually in the pattern, right?\n\n525\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.120\nRemember, going into isolation mode\nin your groups and things like that.\n\n526\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.190\nThat's where I'm at right now.\n\n527\n00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:58.340\nSo I'm in the jive and\nI've got my pattern options panel.\n\n528\n00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.330\nSo let's just start with the panel first.\n\n529\n00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.620\nNotice that it's in this grid.\n\n530\n00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.500\nYou can change how the pattern repeats.\n\n531\n00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.360\nSo I could make it go by a hex, and\nyou can see it change in there.\n\n532\n00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.040\nAnd by brick you can\nalso change the offset.\n\n533\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.970\nReally, instead of explaining everything\nsingle thing in great detail,\n\n534\n00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.260\njust start clicking on it really.\n\n535\n00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.480\nThis is one where like, click around and\ngo crazy because it can be kind of fun.\n\n536\n00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.770\nAnd it really is best demonstrated\nby grid verses block, verses hex and\n\n537\n00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:32.170\nthen, how wide or high the panel, or sorry\nthe pattern goes and how it can overlap.\n\n538\n00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.810\nReally, just start messing around.\n\n539\n00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.710\nWhen we get into our own pattern,\nI think I have in a much\n\n540\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.730\nSimpler pattern and I think you can\nsee these options a little bit better.\n\n541\n00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:46.320\nBut at least I wanted to show you where\nthis is at and notice when I am done,\n\n542\n00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.320\nI can either say, done, yes I want to\ncommit these changes to this pattern.\n\n543\n00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:57.700\nOr if I wanted to then make a new\nversion with a new pattern options,\n\n544\n00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.370\nyou just go ahead and save a copy and\nit'll have a different variation on it.\n\n545\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.470\n>> Very neat.\n>> For now I'm just going to go ahead and\n\n546\n00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.760\ncancel on this one just so\nyou can see where we're gonna go here.\n\n547\n00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.550\nNow I made these three stars\nin this particular size for\n\n548\n00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:14.180\na reason because I'm getting\nready to make our own patterns.\n\n549\n00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.150\nOkay.\n>> All right Von I'm dying to know\n\n550\n00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.630\nwhat you're gonna do with those stars, but\n\n551\n00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.220\nunfortunately I'm going to\nhave to stop you there.\n\n552\n00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.320\nWe're running out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n553\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:23.835\n>> Okay.\n\n554\n00:27:23.835 --> 00:27:27.680\n>> [LAUGH] So if you guys want to see\nwhat happens when those stars and\n\n555\n00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.380\nfigure out what else we can do these\ncolor swatches, make sure you tune in for\n\n556\n00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.510\nthe next episode.\n\n557\n00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.560\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n558\n00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:41.280\nAnd I'm Von Smith and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n",

at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.720\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.275\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\nwe're actually gonna be continuing\n\n6\n00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:28.770\non our discussion on color swatches,\nand back again is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.903\nHow you doing, Vonne?\n>> I'm good, now that I'm back to continue\n\n8\n00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:36.930\nwhat I was trying to say earlier when you\ncut me off, but I was just so excited.\n\n9\n00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.530\nI get so excited talking about swatches.\n\n10\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.980\nAnd there's really a lot to cover,\n\n11\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.980\nas you can already see,\nthat we only got to the patterns.\n\n12\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.030\nWe've still got the spots,\nand all that, the libraries.\n\n13\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.030\nSo, yes, we were right at\nthe point where I was explaining\n\n14\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.980\nwhy I made three stars on my document,\nand where we're gonna go with that.\n\n15\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.120\n>> All right.\n>> So, let's just jump right back into it,\n\n16\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.130\nso I can keep on going with\nmy wonderful thoughts.\n\n17\n00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.755\n>> End the suspense, and\nlet's see what those stars are gonna do.\n\n18\n00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:04.206\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:05.360\n>> There you go.\n\n20\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.740\nAll right.\nSo, as I was saying,\n\n21\n00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.910\nI made these stars in this dimension,\nor this size specifically,\n\n22\n00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.605\nbecause whatever you create, or\nwant to become your pattern, whatever\n\n23\n00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:24.400\nthe size it is when you make it into that,\nthat's going to be the repeating pattern.\n\n24\n00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.360\n>> I know.\n\n25\n00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.540\n>> So, if I'm going to apply it\nto something as small as this,\n\n26\n00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.420\nI don't want really big stars.\n\n27\n00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:36.070\n>> Of a repeating pattern if one\nstar took up the entire fill.\n\n28\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.170\n>> Correct, yes.\n\n29\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.921\nI mean now if I was on a really\nlarge-scale, designing for\n\n30\n00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:43.290\nposters that are gonna go on\nthe side of a building, yeah, maybe.\n\n31\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.700\nBut for here,\nwe're gonna just kind of keep it small.\n\n32\n00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.243\nBut just really kind of emphasizing\nthe size of whatever you're using to make\n\n33\n00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:50.810\nthe pattern makes a difference.\n\n34\n00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.380\nAll right, so how do I do this?\n\n35\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.850\nI've got these three items created.\n\n36\n00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.240\nI've just selected them.\n\n37\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.120\nI'm going to then just take them and\njust drag them into the swatches panel.\n\n38\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.380\nAnd when I let go, you can see there's\na little plus sign right there, I let go,\n\n39\n00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.430\nit creates that pattern swatch, perfect.\n\n40\n00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.810\n>> Wait, slow down, can you do that again?\n\n41\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.320\nToo many steps involved.\n\n42\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.670\n>> Really?\n>> [LAUGH] I'm kidding,\n\n43\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.210\nthat was amazingly easy to\ncreate a new pattern swatch.\n\n44\n00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.910\n>> I was like, did I stutter?\n\n45\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.750\nWhat did I do here?\n\n46\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.420\nDid I miss something?\nIt was just drag and drop.\n\n47\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.720\nYou're trying to be funny.\n\n48\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.470\n>> I was.\n>> Okay.\n\n49\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.713\nAnyways, you're interrupting me again,\nyou're cutting me off.\n\n50\n00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:30.995\n[LAUGH]\n>> Zip.\n\n51\n00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:32.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> Kidding, not kidding.\n\n52\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.201\nOkay.\n[LAUGH] So, I'm back to here.\n\n53\n00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:40.176\nAnd I've got my swatch, and\nif I don't do anything else, that's great,\n\n54\n00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:44.170\nI can just go ahead and click here,\nand apply it, and there's my pattern.\n\n55\n00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.990\nIt's awesome.\n\n56\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.700\n>> Nice.\n\n57\n00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.550\n>> But\nif I wanted it to repeat differently, and\n\n58\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.630\nI'm gonna make this a little bit\nbigger and show you that, okay.\n\n59\n00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.300\nActually I'm gonna show\nyou a few things here.\n\n60\n00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.160\nI can see that, all right,\nI see how it's repeating and that's it.\n\n61\n00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.120\nThere are a few things to notice, that\none I can see the thing behind it, okay.\n\n62\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.100\nI can see the purple through it, because\neverywhere around it there's transparency.\n\n63\n00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.390\nSo, what if I wanted to make\na solid color behind those stars,\n\n64\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.420\nit'll give you that option.\n\n65\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.140\nAnd the other thing, do you notice how\nit's almost like the stars aren't moving?\n\n66\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.860\n>> I was gonna say, the shape is moving,\nbut the fill is almost staying still.\n\n67\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.692\n>> Yes, it is, and it does that by default\nwhich can be really confusing at first,\n\n68\n00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:24.739\nlike no, but\nI want the stars to stop at this edge.\n\n69\n00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.380\nAnd if I move the square, it should\njust move the stuff inside of it.\n\n70\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.700\n>> It should go with it.\n\n71\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.990\n>> It should, you would think, but\nthat's not how patterns actually work.\n\n72\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.165\nIt's, well, I'll get there, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:39.600\n[LAUGH] So,\nlet's go over the swatch options first.\n\n74\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.321\nSo, I'm gonna double click on this.\n\n75\n00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:44.451\nSo, you could see that this demonstration\nhere in the pattern options is going to,\n\n76\n00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:48.463\nI think, show you a little bit easier than\nthat jive pattern that we are editing or\n\n77\n00:03:48.463 --> 00:03:49.466\nmodifying before.\n\n78\n00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:52.113\nYou can see now if I do like the brick,\n\n79\n00:03:52.113 --> 00:03:56.480\nyou can really see the movement\nof how it's going to repeat.\n\n80\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.100\nLike for these, I think,\nthe hex would actually work really well\n\n81\n00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.940\nof how it's going to repeat,\nnot so much by row but by column.\n\n82\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.770\nAgain, just clicking and showing which\none works the best is really just\n\n83\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.100\nwhat you're trying to accomplish by that.\n\n84\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.920\nAnd if you wanted them to be\nspaced out a little bit more,\n\n85\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.950\nyou can size tile to art and\nyou could change this.\n\n86\n00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.810\nYou can see how they\nactually spread apart more.\n\n87\n00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.420\nAnd if you wanna just spread differently,\nthe H and V space, H space and\n\n88\n00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.080\nV space are actually old HTML attributes,\nif you wanted to know.\n\n89\n00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.870\n>> But you can uncheck this, and\n\n90\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.660\nI can change it to not be\nthe same if you don't want it to.\n\n91\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.620\nBut that's where the actual spacing\nbetween the pattern can work,\n\n92\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.970\nif you want it to.\n\n93\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.840\nIt's really up to you.\n\n94\n00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.840\nAnd then, you can change the size and\nso on and so forth.\n\n95\n00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.590\nSo I kind of, that looks good to me.\n\n96\n00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.250\nI'll go with that.\n\n97\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.364\nNow, if I want to keep the version\nI already have, I can save a copy\n\n98\n00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:57.120\nlike we're doing, or if I click done,\nit's just going to apply those changes.\n\n99\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.190\nIt's up to you whichever\none you wanna go with.\n\n100\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.338\nI'll just go with new star,\njust so it could have a back and\n\n101\n00:05:02.338 --> 00:05:03.960\nforth of which way I wanna go.\n\n102\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.940\nAll right, so you can see it's been added.\n\n103\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.940\nIt is telling me right here that you\nare in the pattern editing mode,\n\n104\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.630\nso just make sure you go back and\nunderstand what's going on, pretty much.\n\n105\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.317\nSo, I'm gonna go back and\n\n106\n00:05:16.317 --> 00:05:20.530\nyou can see that right now I have\nboth of my swatches in here.\n\n107\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.483\nI've got my new star and\nI've got my pattern star.\n\n108\n00:05:22.483 --> 00:05:24.418\nAnd actually, they look the same.\n\n109\n00:05:24.418 --> 00:05:26.693\nI think I just clicked\nsomething wrong back there, but\n\n110\n00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:29.080\nthat's okay we can always go\nback if we really wanted to.\n\n111\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.830\nYou could just take these stars and\n\n112\n00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.870\nyou can always just recreate that\nsame swatch that I had started.\n\n113\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.086\nThere's always multiple ways that\nI can do these types of things.\n\n114\n00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:44.230\nSo, the background that I\nwanted to show you guys.\n\n115\n00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.510\nWell, that's where, if you just,\n\n116\n00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.290\nit's really just creating the actual thing\nthat you want to become your pattern.\n\n117\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.969\nSo, if I wanted to, say,\nmake this background green, I don't\n\n118\n00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.311\nreally wanna stroke on that, because I\ndon't think that would look very good.\n\n119\n00:05:57.311 --> 00:05:59.440\nUse your range.\n\n120\n00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.660\nSo, you could go ahead and put that.\n\n121\n00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.570\nWhoops.\n\n122\n00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.790\nWait, wait, there it is, woo.\n\n123\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.412\nOkay, I'm like, wait,\nwhat am I doing wrong?\n\n124\n00:06:05.412 --> 00:06:07.020\nOkay, [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n125\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.140\nYou can see that now, I've got this to be,\nlet me make that a little bit better.\n\n126\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.320\nSorry, I'll stop tweaking, I promise.\n\n127\n00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.202\nOkay, wait, just a little bit more.\n\n128\n00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:16.820\nThere we go, okay.\n\n129\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.140\n>> Ever the perfectionist.\n\n130\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.600\n>> I know, and it's actually bothering\nme that it's not even right now,\n\n131\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.170\nbut that's okay.\n\n132\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.830\nWe'll keep going, so you can see that,\nlet me zoom out a little bit more.\n\n133\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.300\nI take all of this, drag that in,\n\n134\n00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.310\nnow you can see that I have an actual\nsolid background for that pattern.\n\n135\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.950\nIt's really all about what you create.\n\n136\n00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.567\nSo, if you want a background,\nmake a background, if you wanna say.\n\n137\n00:06:38.567 --> 00:06:43.980\nAnd move that,\nthose items into swatch to make a pattern.\n\n138\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.790\n>> Very cool.\n>> Okay, so now the other part of where\n\n139\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.690\nthe square is really just\nmoving around the fill,\n\n140\n00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.170\nrather than fill moves with the square.\n\n141\n00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.190\nThat's because when you make a pattern and\napply it,\n\n142\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.770\nit's actually using something\nknown as a clipping mask.\n\n143\n00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.240\nNow, this isn't an episode where\nwe're gonna talk specifically about\n\n144\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.010\nclipping masks.\n\n145\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:07.380\nBut if you think about a mask, right, you\nhave your mask, and you have your face.\n\n146\n00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.660\nAnd your face, it can move differently\nthan the mask and vice versa.\n\n147\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.805\nSo, it's really a mask.\n\n148\n00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:13.540\nIt's exactly what you think of.\n\n149\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.120\nIt's an area to where you're defining\nsomething behind it, can show through it.\n\n150\n00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.320\nThat's basically-\n>> The eye holes in a mask?\n\n151\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.970\n>> Correct, yes.\n\n152\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.892\nAnd that's why I was doing this and this.\n\n153\n00:07:23.892 --> 00:07:24.570\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.330\n>> I was thinking,\n\n155\n00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.700\nlike a Halloween mask, and\nthat's always my analogy for\n\n156\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.500\nwhat a mask in general means,\nwithout getting too technical about it.\n\n157\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.090\nOkay.\n\n158\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.360\nSo on this particular instance of using\nthe pattern, how can I make it stop\n\n159\n00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.050\ndoing that, like I want it to move\nwith it, it's what's called expand.\n\n160\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.962\nExpand is just, okay, stop being in\nwhatever place you're at and just,\n\n161\n00:07:50.962 --> 00:07:51.925\nI want paths.\n\n162\n00:07:51.925 --> 00:07:56.170\nI want it to be is the easiest\nway to explain it.\n\n163\n00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.830\nSo, in this sense,\nI'm just going to go ahead and expand.\n\n164\n00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.070\nAnd it says, what am I expanding?\n\n165\n00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.927\nI am expanding the fill, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:02.927 --> 00:08:07.211\nMake sure that is checked on,\nbecause it should be, but just in case.\n\n167\n00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:13.130\nNow, if I click OK, notice that now,\nthis is an actual group,\n\n168\n00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.980\nbut the stars are moving\nwith the actual shape.\n\n169\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.773\nNow, I actually expanded the stroke too,\nso\n\n170\n00:08:20.773 --> 00:08:23.429\nnow you can see up here\nthat this is a group.\n\n171\n00:08:23.429 --> 00:08:27.504\nSo, if I, just to show you,\nthe fill and the stroke,\n\n172\n00:08:27.504 --> 00:08:32.395\nwhich is actually now a compound\npath which we went over before,\n\n173\n00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:35.040\nso these are two separate things.\n\n174\n00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.170\nSo if I really wanted to keep the stroke\nas a stroke, I probably should have just\n\n175\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:41.990\nunchecked that stroke check box\nwhen I did the expand options, and\n\n176\n00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.760\nthen it would have stayed\nlike a stroke with a fill.\n\n177\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.820\nBut just to kind of point that out.\n\n178\n00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.269\nI'm just gonna, oops, wrong key again.\n\n179\n00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:54.064\n[LAUGH] I'm going to undo that,\ngo back and at least you now know\n\n180\n00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:59.152\nwhere you can find how and\nwhere patterns can stop moving around.\n\n181\n00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:01.688\n>> Right, and\nit does demonstrate your expand,\n\n182\n00:09:01.688 --> 00:09:03.580\nwhere you said it makes it its own.\n\n183\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.305\nAnd that stroke became its own object\nseparate from the fill and the pattern.\n\n184\n00:09:07.305 --> 00:09:08.005\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Very good.\n\n185\n00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:09.574\n>> Yes, yes it did demonstrate my point.\n\n186\n00:09:09.574 --> 00:09:11.982\n>> [LAUGH] Yay, I'm glad.\n\n187\n00:09:11.982 --> 00:09:14.878\nAll right, so we've done our patterns,\n\n188\n00:09:14.878 --> 00:09:18.699\nwhat's the last type of\nswatch that we haven't done?\n\n189\n00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:20.395\n>> Is the spot?\n\n190\n00:09:20.395 --> 00:09:23.903\n>> Correct, spots, and that goes into our\nlibraries, which I told you about 15 times\n\n191\n00:09:23.903 --> 00:09:26.111\nin the last episode and\nnever showed you where it was.\n\n192\n00:09:26.111 --> 00:09:29.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let me show you.\n\n193\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.490\nLibraries are awesome.\n\n194\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.730\nTo me this is like where all the crayons\nlive, in illustrators I call it.\n\n195\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.146\nThere's a lot of premade stuff for you,\nand where you can find your swatch library\n\n196\n00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:44.562\nis there's two places, down the bottom\nleft-hand corner of your swatch panel,\n\n197\n00:09:44.562 --> 00:09:48.727\nyou've got this little button,\nlooks like books, cuz where do books live?\n\n198\n00:09:48.727 --> 00:09:49.607\nThey live in the library.\n\n199\n00:09:49.607 --> 00:09:51.677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you can click on this and\n\n200\n00:09:51.677 --> 00:09:55.217\nit's going to show you all the different\ntypes of swatch libraries.\n\n201\n00:09:55.217 --> 00:09:56.360\nReally quickly,\n\n202\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.000\nthe one other place that you can go\nto is in the Swatch Panel Options.\n\n203\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.851\nAnd you can go into Open Swatch Library.\n\n204\n00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:06.430\nYou can do the same thing.\n\n205\n00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.770\nSorry I figure I should show you one\nother place where you can find it,\n\n206\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.529\njust because we can cover all our bases.\n\n207\n00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.990\nIt's in the Windows menu,\nscroll all the way down to the bottom.\n\n208\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.600\nYou can see that you can go\ninto your Brush Libraries.\n\n209\n00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.492\nAnd I'm probably go ahead and previewing,\nor what's the, yeah I'm previewing that.\n\n210\n00:10:22.492 --> 00:10:26.616\nYou can do the same thing when we\nget into our graphic styles and\n\n211\n00:10:26.616 --> 00:10:28.610\nour symbols and everything.\n\n212\n00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.606\nAnd we're not doing Brush Libraries,\nwe're doing Swatch Libraries, I'm sorry.\n\n213\n00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:34.814\n[LAUGH] Anyways you can see that you can\nfind all the libraries for the different\n\n214\n00:10:34.814 --> 00:10:38.910\nitems that we'll be covering later in\nother episodes in the Windows menu.\n\n215\n00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.450\nAll right, so let me go back over\nto the bottom left-hand corner,\n\n216\n00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.530\ncuz this is where I always go\nto find my Swatch Libraries.\n\n217\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:48.861\nSo let's go into, say, hm, foods.\n\n218\n00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:51.120\nMm-hm, I'm getting kind of hungry anyways.\n\n219\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.522\nSo if I go into ice cream, you can see\nthat it's going to bring up a whole other\n\n220\n00:10:56.522 --> 00:11:01.604\npanel that has colors that Illustrator\nhas deemed as ice cream colors.\n\n221\n00:11:01.604 --> 00:11:02.764\n>> Hm.\n>> Mm-hm, yummy.\n\n222\n00:11:02.764 --> 00:11:05.308\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So and you can go through.\n\n223\n00:11:05.308 --> 00:11:09.952\nNow, notice that I'm now in another panel,\nand I could go back down to that\n\n224\n00:11:09.952 --> 00:11:14.400\nbottom left-hand corner and\ngo back in to foods, and go through them.\n\n225\n00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.630\nOr I could go into the earth tones,\nbecause I really want some earth tones.\n\n226\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:23.160\nOr you do have these backwards and\nforward buttons, on the bottom of your\n\n227\n00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.110\nlibrary panel, and you could go ahead,\nand just start clicking through\n\n228\n00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.720\nthe different swatch libraries\nthat Illustrator has for you.\n\n229\n00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.271\nSo, mm, some vegetables, right?\n\n230\n00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:36.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I want some broccoli.\n\n231\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.530\nNow, you can use them, straight from\nthe library, like, if I click on this,\n\n232\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.470\nand I use this, like that might be\na rutabaga or something like that.\n\n233\n00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.256\nAnd some over here and some over here.\n\n234\n00:11:47.256 --> 00:11:52.646\nOne thing to notice,\nwhen I'm applying all my swatches,\n\n235\n00:11:52.646 --> 00:11:55.840\ndo they live in my swatches panel?\n\n236\n00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.370\nNo, they do not.\n\n237\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:04.970\nSo solid colors do not actually get\nadded into your actual swatches and\n\n238\n00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:10.370\nyour document from your libraries,\nbut you can add the groups,\n\n239\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.580\nnotice that all of your swatches\nin your libraries are with groups.\n\n240\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.783\nIf you click the Group folder,\nthat was a radish, it wasn't a rutabaga.\n\n241\n00:12:18.783 --> 00:12:23.651\n[LAUGH] So if I click on it,\nnotice that now,\n\n242\n00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:28.230\nit is added into my file of swatches.\n\n243\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:33.300\nSo just make sure if you want them in\nthere for later, you can add the group.\n\n244\n00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.125\nNow I'll show you another\ntrick in a little bit,\n\n245\n00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:40.355\nto add swatches in another place,\nI've got lots of tricks up my sleeve.\n\n246\n00:12:40.355 --> 00:12:41.685\nBut that's a good place to find it.\n\n247\n00:12:41.685 --> 00:12:44.628\nNow let me go through a few more\nlittle things with the libraries, and\n\n248\n00:12:44.628 --> 00:12:46.776\nnote that you have a whole section for\ngradients.\n\n249\n00:12:46.776 --> 00:12:48.493\nRemember all those gradients that I loved?\n\n250\n00:12:48.493 --> 00:12:50.101\nThat's because I love this area.\n\n251\n00:12:50.101 --> 00:12:55.350\nLet's go into the rainbows, or seasonal.\n\n252\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.817\nI thought there was a rainbows.\n\n253\n00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:57.582\nSpectrums, that's why.\n\n254\n00:12:57.582 --> 00:12:58.574\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:12:58.574 --> 00:13:00.233\n>> Okay, so I've got the spectrums, and\n\n256\n00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:01.970\nnotice, there's not that many.\n\n257\n00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.340\nBut I can at least go here and\nsay I really want this one.\n\n258\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.462\nNotice how I don't have to worry\nabout dragging or anything.\n\n259\n00:13:08.462 --> 00:13:13.239\nAnd the other thing, gradients don't\nlive in folders or groups, I'm sorry,\n\n260\n00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:14.820\nso I can't add the group.\n\n261\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.650\nBut as soon as you apply\na gradient from the libraries,\n\n262\n00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.580\nit automatically goes into your swatches.\n\n263\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.850\nSo you don't have to worry about that one,\nwhich is nice.\n\n264\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.940\nIt just goes through and\nI can start adding all sorts of skies, and\n\n265\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.622\nnotice it's just going right on in there.\n\n266\n00:13:28.622 --> 00:13:31.407\nAnd so I had something selected,\nwas applying, but\n\n267\n00:13:31.407 --> 00:13:35.204\nI noticed that I just wanna show you\nthat you don't have to have anything\n\n268\n00:13:35.204 --> 00:13:39.910\nselected to add gradient swatches from the\nlibraries into your swatches panel, okay?\n\n269\n00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.690\nAnd there's lots of patterns in there, so\nwe can go into all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n270\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.650\nI'm starting to get a little carried away,\nso I should probably go ahead and\n\n271\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.850\nreign it back in.\n\n272\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.315\nBecause the reason I wanted to\ngo to libraries all together,\n\n273\n00:13:52.315 --> 00:13:55.180\nis cuz that's where your spot colors live.\n\n274\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.190\nYour spot colors are in what\nare called color books, okay.\n\n275\n00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.390\nRemember Pantone?\n\n276\n00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.505\nNow, Pantone is not the only company\nthat controls the color market,\n\n277\n00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:06.560\nif you wanna say.\n\n278\n00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.340\nBut, they're the only ones I know of, and\n\n279\n00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.360\nthe only ones I know of\nanybody that uses them.\n\n280\n00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.920\nSo, I mean, they are spot, okay.\n\n281\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.889\nSo if I have my Pantone solid coated,\n\n282\n00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:21.828\nbecause remember how we talked about\nhow you could have metallic colors in\n\n283\n00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:25.450\na printed, you could have all\nof those crazy superman colors?\n\n284\n00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.880\nThat's because they do\nhave those particular\n\n285\n00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.380\ncolor books that you can\npick those numbers from.\n\n286\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.940\nSolid color is probably\nthe one that you're gonna\n\n287\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.500\ngo with because you\ntalk about coded stock.\n\n288\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.328\nBut if you're using spots a lot,\nyou're gonna have a little bit more\n\n289\n00:14:38.328 --> 00:14:41.298\nknowledge about printing and\nprinting process, and\n\n290\n00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:46.120\nyou're gonna be talking with your printers\nand you'll know all about this very well.\n\n291\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.140\nSo you can see that I've got\nall of my spot colors here.\n\n292\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.538\nI don't know where 172 lives.\n\n293\n00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:57.240\nI can sit there and hover over it, but\nthat's why you have a search right here.\n\n294\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.200\nSo I can go ahead and then search,\nI can type in 172, and\n\n295\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.020\nnotice that it goes ahead and\nshows me that here it is.\n\n296\n00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.842\nThere's your 172 and if I click on it,\nthis is another where it will\n\n297\n00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:13.525\nadd itself from your swatch libraries,\ninto your swatches panel.\n\n298\n00:15:13.525 --> 00:15:16.456\nThere's my Pantone 172C and\nI'm good to go.\n\n299\n00:15:16.456 --> 00:15:19.930\nIf I wanted to go ahead and\ndo 287, there's my blue.\n\n300\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.860\nGo ahead and add it, and there I am.\n\n301\n00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.137\nSo, when you're mixing spot colors,\n\n302\n00:15:25.137 --> 00:15:28.740\nyou almost always go by\nwhatever the Pantone number is.\n\n303\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.690\nAnd that's why when you're\ndoing those swatch options,\n\n304\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.790\ncan you mix the CNYK to be a spot?\n\n305\n00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:39.740\nYes, but that gets into an area that's\nreally much more specific and kind of like\n\n306\n00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.155\na more advanced print thing than anybody\nwould really need to know about honestly.\n\n307\n00:15:46.155 --> 00:15:50.540\nSo you pretty much just stick\nwith spots as Pantones.\n\n308\n00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.010\nAnd that's how I can create\nspot colors in Illustrator.\n\n309\n00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.590\n>> Fantastic.\n\n310\n00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:01.016\nYeah, I know in the IT world, and I'm sure\nin others as well, we call that a defacto\n\n311\n00:16:01.016 --> 00:16:05.280\nstandard where Pantone has just become\nthe one that everybody uses and goes to.\n\n312\n00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.161\n>> Yeah, it's that IIIE?\n\n313\n00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:10.661\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Well, defacto just being a term saying\n\n314\n00:16:10.661 --> 00:16:14.583\nit's become a standard To public\nacceptance and everybody's mass use of it.\n\n315\n00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:16.812\n>> What, why am I saying I.\n\n316\n00:16:16.812 --> 00:16:17.680\nIt's something back from my tech days.\n\n317\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.470\n>> Yeah that's the institute of\nelectronics and electrical, or\n\n318\n00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.190\nelectrical and electronics engineers.\n\n319\n00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.780\nThey create a lot of IT standards and\nnetworking standards.\n\n320\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.600\n>> Yeah see.\n\n321\n00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.043\nI remembered something from there.\n\n322\n00:16:27.043 --> 00:16:28.951\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> From my network plus days.\n\n323\n00:16:28.951 --> 00:16:30.220\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n324\n00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.600\nSo now we have all these great swatches\nthat we've mixed in our document.\n\n325\n00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.530\nAnd just to kinda demonstrate that\nwhole like swatches are file specific.\n\n326\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.770\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo like a file save as and\n\n327\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:46.460\nI'm gonna say swatches done here,\nso I don't savor my swatches start.\n\n328\n00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.420\nAnd here of course is the yes I\nwant Illustrator CC for my version.\n\n329\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.550\nAnd that's great.\n\n330\n00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.860\nSo if I went over to my color.\n\n331\n00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.160\nNot the same one, right,\nthen my color file.\n\n332\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.500\nOr if I started a new document,\nI'm just going really quick.\n\n333\n00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.960\nSo I'll come back to this.\n\n334\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.430\nI don't have them in here either.\n\n335\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:08.120\nSo how can I get them into my other files?\n\n336\n00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.090\nThis goes into creating your own library,\nokay?\n\n337\n00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:17.310\nIllustrator has all of their libraries for\nall of our crayons that we wanna use.\n\n338\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:22.010\nI wanna make my own library and if I can\nmake my own library then I can access that\n\n339\n00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.610\nfrom any other file,\njust like I did my other libraries.\n\n340\n00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:26.955\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Pretty awesome so-\n\n341\n00:17:26.955 --> 00:17:28.020\n>> Great.\n\n342\n00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.160\n>> How you do that?\n\n343\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.150\nI want all of these swatches,\n\n344\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.430\nthese beautiful swatches-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.590\n>> To be available for other files.\n\n346\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.840\nSo you come up here to your panel options\nbutton the four lines and a triangle.\n\n347\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.820\nAnd it's probably gonna be behind my head,\nso you can see down at the bottom it says\n\n348\n00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.030\nSave Swatch Library, but\nyou have two options down here.\n\n349\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.110\nYou have save it as an AI,\nor save it as an ASE.\n\n350\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.320\nLong story short,\nif you're saving it as an AI,\n\n351\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.540\nthen it's only gonna be used\nin Illustrator products, okay?\n\n352\n00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.460\nI'm only gonna\nOnly Illustrator Swatch libraries.\n\n353\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.424\nASE is where you can go across\nmultiple Adobe products to where it's\n\n354\n00:18:04.424 --> 00:18:05.762\nAdobe Swatch Exchange.\n\n355\n00:18:05.762 --> 00:18:10.269\nTo where you can go from any libraries\nthat are used in illustrator can be loaded\n\n356\n00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:13.015\ninto Photoshop, or\nIn Design, of vice versa.\n\n357\n00:18:13.015 --> 00:18:16.527\nI can go from In Design to AI,\nthey do have some limitations.\n\n358\n00:18:16.527 --> 00:18:19.944\nIt's not gonna bring over your\npatterns and your gradients.\n\n359\n00:18:19.944 --> 00:18:21.500\nBut for your solid colors,\n\n360\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.210\nit is a really good way to exchange\nswatches across multiple Adobe products.\n\n361\n00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:30.280\nSo, it's pretty awesome, but since\nwe're talking about illustrator here,\n\n362\n00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.900\nwe're going to just go with\nsafe swatch libraries for AI.\n\n363\n00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.980\nAnd the AS Seed Swatch Exchange\nis actually really easy,\n\n364\n00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.010\nso it's not some super complicated thing.\n\n365\n00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.160\nSo, if I go with Saves\nswatch libraries is AI.\n\n366\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.350\nIt's going to automatically\ndefault to the swatch's folder\n\n367\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.740\nwithin my Adobe product or\nthe application.\n\n368\n00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.800\nSo don't change the location if\nyou're doing AI files or AI swatches.\n\n369\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.500\nSidenote if you're doing the ASE ones.\n\n370\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.950\nPut it somewhere where\nyou're gonna remember it.\n\n371\n00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Put it on your desktop\n\n372\n00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.000\ncuz it really just is an exchange file.\n\n373\n00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.230\nIt doesn't have to live within your\nprogram files within your application.\n\n374\n00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.310\nYou don't want it to, actually.\n\n375\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.550\nYou want it to live outside so\n\n376\n00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:16.280\nyou can just quickly find it when loading\nthat ASE file from other applications.\n\n377\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.060\n>> Very good.\n\n378\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.100\n>> Okay so, let's go with,\nI'll just name it my name.\n\n379\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.040\nSo there we go.\n\n380\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.760\nIt's my library name.\n\n381\n00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.330\nVonne, that's great.\n\n382\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.600\nSo if I came over and started a new file.\n\n383\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.480\nAnd I'm just gonna start with Print for\nfun.\n\n384\n00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.940\nClick OK, cuz this is for\ndemonstration purposes only.\n\n385\n00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.000\nCome over here.\n\n386\n00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.170\nI really want those swatches.\n\n387\n00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:45.980\nCome down here into my library and\nit's the User Defined down here.\n\n388\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:46.930\nUser Defined group.\n\n389\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:51.680\nAnd you can see right over there,\nthat that's where my swatch library lives.\n\n390\n00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.190\nI click it, and all of those wonderful,\n\n391\n00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.830\ncrazy swatches that I was mixing before-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.880\n>> All right here,\n\n393\n00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.790\nand they're ready to go.\n\n394\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.400\nAnd I can use them.\n\n395\n00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.370\nAnd I could add my libraries, you could\nactually select all of these swatches,\n\n396\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.640\nyou could just go and\nshift-click all of them.\n\n397\n00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.280\nSee, I just clicked on the first one,\nand then I shift-clicked, and\n\n398\n00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.130\nI can move them all over here.\n\n399\n00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.330\nNow, I would get some duplicate\nswatches from here so\n\n400\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:23.040\nyou could actually take all of these and\ndelete them if you wanted to.\n\n401\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.890\nAnyways, you could go ahead and just drag\nthem all in here, and notice that every\n\n402\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.580\nsingle swatch that I had available from\nmy library is now into my swatches panel.\n\n403\n00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.890\nI would normally probably\ndelete some of them,\n\n404\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:39.260\nyou can't delete every single one of them,\nyou can't delete registration and none.\n\n405\n00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.610\nBut you can select all the other swatches,\ndelete them first, and\n\n406\n00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.800\nthen bring in your other swatches.\n\n407\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.110\nIf you wanted to,\nthat's just something that I do.\n\n408\n00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.500\nAnd since I'm talking about\nthe leading swatches,\n\n409\n00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.850\nif I really didn't want this\npattern swatch for whatever reason.\n\n410\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.610\nNotice how when I have that swatch\nselected I can come down here\n\n411\n00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.320\nto the trash can and\nI can go ahead and delete that swatch.\n\n412\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.360\nAnd it's like,\nare you sure you wanna do that, and\n\n413\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.070\nyes you can delete swatches since\nI was all ready mentioning that.\n\n414\n00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.090\nI should probably go ahead and\ntell you that.\n\n415\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:13.640\nA few other things while I'm at this\nscreen that I wanted to show you that\n\n416\n00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.110\ncan throw people off and\nI've seen people do this.\n\n417\n00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.810\nWhere did all my swatches go?\n\n418\n00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.300\nYou've changed it into\nwhat swatches are showing.\n\n419\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.510\nSo it's like I know I had\ngradients in there but\n\n420\n00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:28.160\nif you're showing just color swatches,\nyou're not gonna see any gradients.\n\n421\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.520\nIf you come to here, or if you only\nsee grey and its not my solid colors,\n\n422\n00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.070\nsometimes you can throw that filter,\nif you want to say, on that panel, and\n\n423\n00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.970\nit can throw you off sometimes.\n\n424\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:44.850\nSo just be a little careful\nabout those swatch options and\n\n425\n00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.810\nthat's how you can share\nswatches across files.\n\n426\n00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.200\nYou know that swatches are file specific,\n\n427\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.750\nthere's one thing I wanted to\nshow you with that new file.\n\n428\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.890\nI really want to drive this point home,\n\n429\n00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.640\nof all these different episodes we've been\ndoing about color and the color values and\n\n430\n00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.820\nare we in CMYK or RGB mode and\nall that fun stuff.\n\n431\n00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.950\nIf I go back over here to File, New, I'm\ngonna close out this library, by the way.\n\n432\n00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.380\nCuz we were just showing how\nwe could move those around.\n\n433\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:19.520\nIf I go to File, New, and I'm going to\nchose from my profile, Print or Web.\n\n434\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.890\nI wanna show you.\n\n435\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.340\nWe know that Print is all about CMYK,\nand all that.\n\n436\n00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:29.920\nSo, if I click OK,\nnotice that I have my swatches.\n\n437\n00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.330\nIf I hover over all of these.\n\n438\n00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.657\nAnd you might not be able to see it\ntoo well, but I can't really zoom in.\n\n439\n00:22:33.657 --> 00:22:38.580\nIf I hover, they'll give me all the values\nof these colors in a CMYK color mode.\n\n440\n00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.320\nRight from the start cuz, why?\n\n441\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.340\nI chose Print as my profile for my file.\n\n442\n00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.910\nAnd if I go to my Color panel, what is it?\n\n443\n00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:54.110\nAll my sliders are in CMYK, so\neverything that I'm going to be doing\n\n444\n00:22:54.110 --> 00:23:00.230\nin this CMYK file We'll be in a CMYK\ncolor mode, so it's just automatic, okay.\n\n445\n00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.500\nNow let me demonstrate if\nI did a file new into Web.\n\n446\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:08.480\nIf I go to Web, and\nas I still have my color panel open.\n\n447\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.580\nThe sliders are already RGB.\n\n448\n00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.430\nI think we might have done\nthat in another episode.\n\n449\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.352\nBut if I didn't, I just really,\nreally wanna drive this point home.\n\n450\n00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:22.070\nAnd notice my swatches are showing\neverything in an RGB color mode.\n\n451\n00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:26.680\nIf I hover over all of these swatches,\nit's showing all the values in RGB.\n\n452\n00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.790\nAnd you can see the colors,\ncan you see the colors dimming?\n\n453\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.560\nThese are much brighter, right?\n\n454\n00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.170\nAnd then the CMYK file,\nthose are much dimmer.\n\n455\n00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.860\nIt's because we have that gamut,\nthat gamut that we talked about\n\n456\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.260\nthe CMYK has the smaller gamut\nof colors that it can reproduce.\n\n457\n00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.800\nAnd that's a real demonstration of it.\n\n458\n00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.780\nAnd one last thing,\nthat I wanted to throw out there,\n\n459\n00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.270\nis back on this color file that we started\nwith when were doing all of our theory.\n\n460\n00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.870\nAll of this is in RGB mode, right?\n\n461\n00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:58.140\nIf I take this, and I'm just gonna select,\nthis is a grouped item, and, actually,\n\n462\n00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.860\nit's probably gonna show\na little bit more here.\n\n463\n00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.020\nLet me do the print side.\n\n464\n00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.270\nSo, I'm just gonna copy this, okay?\n\n465\n00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.551\nI did a control c, or command c.\n\n466\n00:24:05.551 --> 00:24:09.473\nAnd I come over here to my CMYK file,\nand I paste,\n\n467\n00:24:09.473 --> 00:24:12.743\nlook at the difference in those colors.\n\n468\n00:24:12.743 --> 00:24:13.580\n>> Wow.\n\n469\n00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.102\n>> You see?\n\n470\n00:24:14.102 --> 00:24:14.659\nLet me show you again.\n\n471\n00:24:14.659 --> 00:24:17.922\nSo this This is what\nthe colors looked like there.\n\n472\n00:24:17.922 --> 00:24:21.020\nAnd this is what it looks\nlike when it copies over.\n\n473\n00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.690\nWhy do you think it did that?\n\n474\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.540\n>> Because of the reduced gamma?\n\n475\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.290\n>> Exactly.\n\n476\n00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.110\nWhich is great, because that's why\nif I'm designing something for web,\n\n477\n00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.050\nand I need to go ahead and\nmake it into print.\n\n478\n00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.450\nI just copy your thing and\nput it into a CMYK file and\n\n479\n00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:39.370\nI know that those colors are going\nto be converted if you want to say,\n\n480\n00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.960\ninto a print friendly mode.\n\n481\n00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.320\nAnd even though our sliders say RGB,\n\n482\n00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.510\nbecause we know those sliders\ndon't really matter right now.\n\n483\n00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:52.850\nThat it will show me that, that is the\nclosest color that it can show me in CMYK.\n\n484\n00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.040\nAnd that's what I got.\n\n485\n00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.200\nAnd then actually, one last thing\nI wanted to demonstrate here.\n\n486\n00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.170\nI'm glad I actually did this\nbecause it's a really fun one.\n\n487\n00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.170\nI love doing this one.\n\n488\n00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:07.170\nAnd that is creating swatches from\nthings that are already created,\n\n489\n00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.050\ncuz that happens a lot.\n\n490\n00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:12.700\nI get files from other people\nthat it makes swatches.\n\n491\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.480\nOr I just need it for somewhere.\n\n492\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.510\nI've got this really awesome\ngray that somebody makes but\n\n493\n00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.400\nI want the colors out of them.\n\n494\n00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.420\nThat's pretty great.\n\n495\n00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:25.750\nSo I actually have a file that I wanted\nto start with to demonstrate this.\n\n496\n00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.280\nAnd I've got swatches from artwork.\n\n497\n00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.762\nSee, I was ready for this.\n\n498\n00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:30.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n499\n00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.200\n>> I'm glad I did that,\n\n500\n00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.610\nbecause I almost forgot this awesome part.\n\n501\n00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.910\nOkay, so, here's my file.\n\n502\n00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.530\nNotice that a lot of these colors\nthat I have are not in here.\n\n503\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.770\nI can select all of these.\n\n504\n00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.990\nI want all of these things that\nhave these colors applied.\n\n505\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.920\nI want to make swatches out of them.\n\n506\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.770\nSo I select the item and\nyou click on the new color group.\n\n507\n00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:57.150\nAnd it's going to say, do you want to\nmake a group out of the selected items?\n\n508\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.420\nAnd you could just say yes.\n\n509\n00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.870\nNotice that it is saying right\nhere from the selected artwork.\n\n510\n00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.660\nYes, I want the selected artwork.\n\n511\n00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.740\nAnd this is pretty cool,\nconvert process to global.\n\n512\n00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.180\nRemember, we talked about\nwhat a global swatch is.\n\n513\n00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.180\nThat could be pretty awesome.\n\n514\n00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.490\nI click OK.\n\n515\n00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.160\nAnd then look at all of\nthe swatches that were just created\n\n516\n00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.540\nall from this artwork that I can\nthen go back and apply later.\n\n517\n00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.180\nThat's-\n>> And\n\n518\n00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.550\na little white corner\nindicating that they're global.\n\n519\n00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.810\n>> You've been listening.\n\n520\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:24.565\nGood job.\n\n521\n00:26:24.565 --> 00:26:27.130\n[LAUGH] Yes, I love this option.\n\n522\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.950\nI use it a lot.\n\n523\n00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.990\nAnd this is my other favorite one,\nis this gradient, right?\n\n524\n00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.770\nLove these colors and these gradients, and\nI could use the gradient in other places,\n\n525\n00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.080\nbut I want the colors out of them.\n\n526\n00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.890\nI want the solid color,\n\n527\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.730\nmaybe I want to add text in that\nsame exact purple on that stop.\n\n528\n00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.810\nSame idea, you select the gradient,\n\n529\n00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:49.150\nyou click on the new color group,\nand it is from the selected artwork.\n\n530\n00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.390\nI could be naming these along the way,\nbut I am not, and I'm going to click ok,\n\n531\n00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:57.570\nand notice that these are the actual\ncolor stops in the gradient.\n\n532\n00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.480\nSo it basically disassembled that gradient\nand gave you each one of the solid colors.\n\n533\n00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.765\n>> Yes, every single one of those houses.\n\n534\n00:27:03.765 --> 00:27:05.220\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Remember on the gradient ramp, or\n\n535\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.380\nthe color stops.\n\n536\n00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.160\nThat's actually showing me,\nand it creates me a group.\n\n537\n00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.425\nI can make them global and then I can go\non my merry way and go crazy with them.\n\n538\n00:27:12.425 --> 00:27:15.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I love this option.\n\n539\n00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.180\nFantastic, Von.\n\n540\n00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.100\nGreat look at colors and\n\n541\n00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.090\ncolor swatches and how we could take\nadvantage of those pre-built libraries.\n\n542\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.550\nWe can create our own libraries,\nwe can add colors,\n\n543\n00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.690\nsolid spot, pattern,\ngradient swatches, right.\n\n544\n00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.510\nWe can create groups out of some of them.\n\n545\n00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:35.350\nRemember not gradients and\nnot patterns if I remember that correctly.\n\n546\n00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.620\nBut lots of really cool information Von.\n\n547\n00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.440\nWe appreciate that, really enjoyed it.\n\n548\n00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.550\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n549\n00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.600\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n550\n00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.720\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n551\n00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.722\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

Yes. >> But\nI wont give you a quiz.\n\n49\n00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.249\nLike I did last time.\n\n50\n00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.050\n>> [INAUDIBLE] my goodness.\n\n51\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.230\nI tell you though you could\nreally help me out with this.\n\n52\n00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.100\nBecause I know for\n\n53\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.040\nsome of you that doesn't understand\nabout what fonts are saying to me.\n\n54\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.010\nI look at a list of fonts like that.\n\n55\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.990\nIlustrator gives you\na lot of fonts built in.\n\n56\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.870\nI don't know which one I'm picking,\nI'm just randomly selecting one.\n\n57\n00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.470\n>> Yes.\nAnd\n\n58\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.940\nthat way we're going to look\nat the text a little bit more.\n\n59\n00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.520\nWhat does it actually mean?\n\n60\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.467\nThe open type fonts, two type fonts,\nand we're gonna have a myriad of fun.\n\n61\n00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:40.291\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n62\n00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:45.289\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nI have a file that I've created to help\n\n63\n00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.970\nus along through this typography theory.\n\n64\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.720\nThis is typography 101.\n\n65\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.950\nWe're talking about type faces.\n\n66\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.920\nYou can actually look this up.\n\n67\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.200\nIf you do a little search info, type\nface versus font and what does it mean?\n\n68\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.190\nThere's all sorts of different\ndefinitions of trying to explain it.\n\n69\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.680\nOne talks about it as it's a song\nwithin an album that you're looking at.\n\n70\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.310\nSo, when you're talking about type face,\n\n71\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.820\nit's also you can refer to\nit as like a font family.\n\n72\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.360\nOkay?\nBecause for\n\n73\n00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.010\nexample, I think it's best to\neven just start right here.\n\n74\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.500\nLike Garamond, okay?\n\n75\n00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.340\nGaramond, you can call that a type face or\na font family.\n\n76\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.880\nIt's just like the look of what\nthat font is, if you want to say.\n\n77\n00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.400\nYou can have different variations\nof the Garamond type face.\n\n78\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.780\nLike for example, here you have regular\nGaramond, and you have Adobe Garamond Pro.\n\n79\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.340\nAnd if you actually searched online for\nGaramond,\n\n80\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.580\nthere's tons of ones that you can find.\n\n81\n00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.150\nAnd we can talk about font foundries\nwhere you can find free fonts.\n\n82\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.650\nNot where you find them, but you know\nfree fonts versus how you purchase them.\n\n83\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.388\nBut there's many variations on\nthe same theme if you want to say.\n\n84\n00:03:59.388 --> 00:04:01.940\nNot all Garamond's are the same.\n\n85\n00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.000\nOkay, but that is a typeface,\n\n86\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.450\nand then there's the font would be\nthe actual name that you're using.\n\n87\n00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.530\n>> That particular style of Garamond.\n\n88\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.450\n>> Correct, yes,\nyou could throw it that way.\n\n89\n00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.140\nAnd with talking about style, that's\nanother way that people can describe.\n\n90\n00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.910\nThere's Garamond but\nthen there's Garamond Italic, Bold.\n\n91\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.030\nOkay so those are, you could have\nfull fonts that's a Garamond Bold,\n\n92\n00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.610\nor it could be a font style off of a font.\n\n93\n00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.570\nI don't wanna get too in the weeds of\n\n94\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.790\nunderstanding is it a typeface,\nis it a font?\n\n95\n00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.420\nA lot of people use it interchangeably.\n\n96\n00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.480\nIt's a font, it's a typeface,\nit's a font family.\n\n97\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.720\nThere are people and there are things\nout there that they are separate and\n\n98\n00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.930\nthey do have separate meanings.\n\n99\n00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.480\nI think it's a little too technical\nhonestly, I just kind of use the word\n\n100\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.960\ninterchangeably like\nwe're going to as well.\n\n101\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.330\nBut just know that there\nis a slight difference if\n\n102\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.660\nyou get to somebody that's\nlike no it's different.\n\n103\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.240\nYes it is.\n>> [LAUGH] But in Illustrator for us for\n\n104\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.920\nall intents and purposes.\n\n105\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.610\n>> We're just gonna call them fonts.\n\n106\n00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.110\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay?\n\n107\n00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.850\n[LAUGH] It's just, that's what it is.\n\n108\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.910\nSo, and then the font style,\nI did specifically put that\n\n109\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.410\nin there because when we get into\nthe formatting of that font,\n\n110\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.720\nthat's where it will actually show\nin the drop down, is the font style.\n\n111\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.155\nThat's what they call it, as that thing,\n\n112\n00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:25.690\n[LAUGH] that thing that\nyou do in the Panel.\n\n113\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.200\nWow, that was a really\ngreat description [LAUGH].\n\n114\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.280\nMore to come.\n\n115\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.000\nOkay, I think you guys\nget the idea though.\n\n116\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.700\nAll right, so, now we're going to move on\nto the wonderful world of sans serif and\n\n117\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.400\nserif fonts.\n\n118\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.820\nSo, whats the difference between this and\nthis?\n\n119\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.650\nThis is a quiz Mikey so what is this?\n\n120\n00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.710\n>> This one I know in dealing\nwith computers as I do.\n\n121\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.210\nI know that the San Serif\nis without the little,\n\n122\n00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.560\nnow I'm gonna call them\na highly technical term.\n\n123\n00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.160\nWithout the little feet whereas serif has\nthe little feet or tails on the letters.\n\n124\n00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.375\n>> I go with doohickeys.\n\n125\n00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:03.875\n[LAUGH]\n>> Do you?\n\n126\n00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:04.675\nThat's even more\n\n127\n00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:05.295\ntechnical.\n[LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:06:05.295 --> 00:06:05.825\n>> Exactly.\n\n129\n00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:07.440\nBut I would actually call them feet.\n\n130\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.000\n>> Okay.\n>> Feet and\n\n131\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.220\nno feet if you wanna say, because.\n\n132\n00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.415\nWhat we mean by the feet are these\nlittle things right here on the ends of\n\n133\n00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.537\nthe h like that's an actual,\nthat's a foot.\n\n134\n00:06:15.537 --> 00:06:16.129\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n135\n00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:17.499\n>> At the end of the i.\n\n136\n00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.449\nAs opposed to the serif\nfonts there's no feet,\n\n137\n00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.120\nthere's no feet on this particular font.\n\n138\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.940\nThis is a non, or sans-serif font.\n\n139\n00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.420\nAnd this is a serif font.\n\n140\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.390\n>> I always think of the serif fonts\nas maybe being a little more formal.\n\n141\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.700\n>> Yeah you can say that.\n\n142\n00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.660\n>> Yeah.\n>> And probably why you think it's formal.\n\n143\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.720\nDo you know where you normally see this\nfont very prevalantly in the world?\n\n144\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.393\n>> Literature.\nMature books?\n\n145\n00:06:43.393 --> 00:06:44.210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n146\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.570\nMaybe, yes.\nAnd newspapers.\n\n147\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.470\n>> Newspapers, yes.\n\n148\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.750\n>> Yeah, and do you know why you see this\nparticular font in books and newspapers?\n\n149\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.500\nBecause those feet, they actually add,\n\n150\n00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.220\nthey acts as guides for\nyour eyes to travel across the page\n\n151\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.000\nbecause that Serif gives you that line\nof where you're supposed to go across.\n\n152\n00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.966\n>> Okay, very cool.\n>> Yeah.\n\n153\n00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:13.780\nAnd now why would you use a Serif font or\nSans Serif font in a book?\n\n154\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.780\nYes, it's totally fine.\n\n155\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:20.230\nSo it's not, it's really a stylistic\nchoice, but that is some of the psychology\n\n156\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.230\nbehind why you would want to use a Serif\nfont verses, this is a sans serif font.\n\n157\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.320\nThey say that you can usually\nreserve your sans serif for\n\n158\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.380\nyour headlines, so bigger fonts.\n\n159\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.630\nYou know, you dont see a lot of serif\nfonts on street signs, things like that,\n\n160\n00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.360\nits all in a sans serif font,\nbecause its a heading.\n\n161\n00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.900\nAgain, you can always break the rules But\nit's just,\n\n162\n00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.140\nthat's kind of the norm,\nif you want to say, so they say.\n\n163\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.361\nAll right, so we have Sans Serif and\nwe have Serif fonts.\n\n164\n00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:53.393\nNow down here, I said I wouldn't\nbe quizzing you but guess what?\n\n165\n00:07:53.393 --> 00:07:54.201\n>> Another one?\n\n166\n00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:55.080\n>> I want to quiz you some more.\n\n167\n00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.900\n[LAUGH] So\nwhat's the difference between this,\n\n168\n00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.740\nand over here, this?\n\n169\n00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.410\nCan you see the difference?\n\n170\n00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.585\n>> One looks a little bit thinner and\nlighter.\n\n171\n00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:10.330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n172\n00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.745\n>> Both 14 points.\n\n173\n00:08:11.745 --> 00:08:12.480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n174\n00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.520\n>> So maybe one is bold?\n\n175\n00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.720\nThat was totally not right, but\n[LAUGH] I didn't prep you on this one, so\n\n176\n00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.270\nyou're going a little cold.\n\n177\n00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.870\nSo, I'll give you this one.\n\n178\n00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.460\nLook at the overall width.\n\n179\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.350\nLet's go with that.\n\n180\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.236\nDo you see the letters here in Myriad?\n\n181\n00:08:30.236 --> 00:08:30.952\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n182\n00:08:30.952 --> 00:08:34.634\n>> All right, versus Courier over here.\n\n183\n00:08:34.634 --> 00:08:37.191\n>> A little more spaced out.\n\n184\n00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:42.980\n>> Yes,\ncuz we're getting into proportioned fonts.\n\n185\n00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.920\nOr mono spaced fonts.\n\n186\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.310\nSo I actually have something here.\n\n187\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.440\nSo you see right here,\nproportional fonts and mono spaced fonts.\n\n188\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.550\nYou can really see it here on Courier.\n\n189\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:58.130\nYou see that each letter\nactually occupies the same space.\n\n190\n00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.440\n>> Even though some of those\nletters are not quite as wide,\n\n191\n00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.735\nthey still take up the same space.\n\n192\n00:09:01.735 --> 00:09:02.860\n>> Mm-hm.\nLike an I,\n\n193\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.020\nas opposed to over here, in our\nproportional fonts, you can see look,\n\n194\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.370\nwhoops wrong zoom, you can see\nthat the I is actually smaller.\n\n195\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.651\n>> Much thinner than the [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah thinner and then the a and\n\n196\n00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:19.193\nthe m, of uppercase m takes a lot\nmore space than Myriad, and so\n\n197\n00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:24.440\nthat would be a proportional font\nversus a mono spaced font, so.\n\n198\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.420\nSo that's always a fun one.\n\n199\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.130\nAnd, talking about what does this say,\nCourier New,\n\n200\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.540\nthat's a very, it's like a typewriter.\n\n201\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.690\nIt's a very old-school, if you wanna say,\nand that's what it looks like to me.\n\n202\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.040\n>> Right.\n>> As our proportional fonts.\n\n203\n00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.870\n>> Cuz those typewriters, they moved\na set amount, every time you hit the key,\n\n204\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.330\nthe\n>> Good carriage return or\n\n205\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.775\nthat thing moved in the exact same\nspace no matter what you typed.\n\n206\n00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:48.500\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\nAnd so,\n\n207\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.150\nthat's why you have monospaced and.\n\n208\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:54.970\nAnd again, that space of the letters,\nthat says something to you as well.\n\n209\n00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:00.560\nDo you want that Mono-spaced font versus\na proportional, which is different than\n\n210\n00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.820\nserif and san serif, it's just those are\nall the different ways that you can kinda\n\n211\n00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:09.100\ndescribe what you got going with your\ntexts or the font that you're choosing.\n\n212\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.280\nAnd then you're gonna get a little\nbit more technical than that.\n\n213\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.490\nI don't have everything\nabout the anatomy of a font,\n\n214\n00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.580\nbut something like here like\nan uppercase A versus a lowercase A.\n\n215\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.040\nDoes the A have the little hoop or\ndoes an A look like this.\n\n216\n00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.840\nOr is it just like a circle\nwith like a line off of it.\n\n217\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.350\nHow does your g look.\n\n218\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.860\nHow does your P is, it's,\nwhen you start really looking at fonts,\n\n219\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.040\nlike what do your e's look like,\nwhat do your upper and\n\n220\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.960\nlower cases,\nyou really see a huge difference.\n\n221\n00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.360\nIt's something that you probably don't\nsee every day, but if you really start\n\n222\n00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.620\nlooking, like g's look completely\ndifferent in so many different fonts.\n\n223\n00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.040\nOkay, and so to go over the little\nbit of the anatomy of a font,\n\n224\n00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.710\nI actually have a whole layer in here.\n\n225\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.680\nLook at all this stuff.\n\n226\n00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.402\n[LAUGH]\n>> Wow.\n\n227\n00:10:54.402 --> 00:10:56.086\n>> So these are some technical names.\n\n228\n00:10:56.086 --> 00:10:58.068\nThere's the stem, the arms, and the balls.\n\n229\n00:10:58.068 --> 00:11:01.332\nAnd I don't even have all of them okay,\nbut\n\n230\n00:11:01.332 --> 00:11:05.470\nthese are actual names for\nthe parts of letters.\n\n231\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.250\n>> I didn't know the parts of\nthe letters actually had names.\n\n232\n00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:09.940\n>> Right?\n\n233\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.240\nDo you remember when you were learning\nhow to write back in grade school,\n\n234\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.065\nthey had the lines and\nthey have little dashes between it.\n\n235\n00:11:17.065 --> 00:11:17.625\n>> Yes.\n\n236\n00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:19.825\n>> And\nthat's where your P goes below the line..\n\n237\n00:11:19.825 --> 00:11:20.405\n>> That's right.\n\n238\n00:11:20.405 --> 00:11:23.515\n>> Your H goes above the dotted line,\nbut it stays within that.\n\n239\n00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:25.505\nWell there's actual names for that.\n\n240\n00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:29.805\nThey did that on purpose for us,\nto try and teach us where our letters go.\n\n241\n00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:32.935\nBecause you can see that the baseline,\nthey call this,\n\n242\n00:11:32.935 --> 00:11:35.405\nis where the texts actually sits.\n\n243\n00:11:35.405 --> 00:11:40.540\nThat line, that's where you write\nthe P below, and the Y goes below and\n\n244\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.460\nthen there's something known as\nan x-height that acts like the height\n\n245\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.085\nof where that, remember the dotted\nline you go above that?\n\n246\n00:11:48.085 --> 00:11:50.080\n>> Mm-hm, right.\n>> Now that was the x-height.\n\n247\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.380\nOkay, now this one is showing it in\nthere the x-height is not equal,\n\n248\n00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.420\nbut when we're learning how to write,\nthat's what they wanted to do.\n\n249\n00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:02.190\nAnd on the cap height, and the median, I\nmean all of these things, they have names.\n\n250\n00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.176\n>> Which is, I think, fascinating.\n\n251\n00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:04.682\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is.\n\n252\n00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.640\n[LAUGH] >> And there's some more.\n\n253\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.090\nI just wanted to throw\na few of those in there.\n\n254\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.490\nSo, they have all of these different ways.\n\n255\n00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.870\nAnd that's where,\nwhat does your g look like in a font,\n\n256\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.750\nwhat does the a look like,\nwhat does the p look like.\n\n257\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.470\nThey're very.\n\n258\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.970\nP's G's A's E's, they all look different.\n\n259\n00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.210\nAre the E's lines, or do they have\na hoop is that what they're calling it.\n\n260\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.890\nYeah a bolt.\n\n261\n00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.845\nDoes it have a little swirl, all those\ndifferent things, it's really, really fun.\n\n262\n00:12:34.095 --> 00:12:35.287\nAt least I think it's fun.\n\n263\n00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:37.425\n[LAUGH] It's really technical and\nit's fun.\n\n264\n00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:42.575\nAll right, so anyway let's move on\nto TrueType and OpenType fonts.\n\n265\n00:12:42.575 --> 00:12:45.520\nSo I have a little notes for us.\n\n266\n00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.311\nNow we can get really technical here,\nso am gonna keep very, very basic,\n\n267\n00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:54.738\nbut you could read for\nthose another word, those Wikipedia holes.\n\n268\n00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:58.895\n[CROSSTALK] All right, so two types\nof fonts, when you are looking at and\n\n269\n00:12:58.895 --> 00:13:03.469\nyou are chasing fonts on your computer you\nare either a two types of fonts an open\n\n270\n00:13:03.469 --> 00:13:04.316\ntype, Font.\n\n271\n00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:09.840\nNow, you could also be a PS1,\nPS2, PS3, post script fonts.\n\n272\n00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.818\nAgain, too much.\n\n273\n00:13:10.818 --> 00:13:13.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Truetype, Opentype.\n\n274\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.710\nTruetype, back in the day was\ncreated by Apple, actually.\n\n275\n00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:23.340\nAnd back in the day with computers,\nright we have the Mac and we have the PC,\n\n276\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.260\nyou had fonts that were written\nspecifically for each operating system.\n\n277\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.070\n>> I do remember some website design,\nwhere you had to be careful what\n\n278\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.660\nfont you chose or it might not show\nup on certain operating systems.\n\n279\n00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.230\n>> Just kind of saying back when we were\ntalking about web safe colors, right?\n\n280\n00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.250\nThere's only 216 web safe colors.\n\n281\n00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.080\nThere were certain fonts that you couldn't\ndisplay on a website because of that\n\n282\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.120\noperating system, because back in the day,\nyou had that true type font.\n\n283\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.510\nYou had a MAC version font file, and\nyou had a Windows version font file.\n\n284\n00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.210\nAnd so, if I'm on a MAC and\ncreating Text, and\n\n285\n00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.000\nI send it to you, it could be Arial,\nArial's a very common font.\n\n286\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.120\nBut we wouldn't be able to talk to\nthe files wouldn't be able to talk,\n\n287\n00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.930\nbecause the fonts don't match,\nbecause of the operating system.\n\n288\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:16.120\nAnd that's where open type fonts were\ncreated, because of this problem.\n\n289\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.790\nAnd that was actually created by a joint\neffort with Microsoft and Adobe,\n\n290\n00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:25.830\nwhere they basically made\nthis type of this format for\n\n291\n00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:31.130\nfonts to create one font for both\noperating systems which is really great.\n\n292\n00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.390\nBut it goes a little deeper than that.\n\n293\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.410\n>> I see Microsoft and\n\n294\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.520\nAdobe I don't see Apple in the people\nthat were making the fonts.\n\n295\n00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.800\nThat was supposed to work\non both operating systems.\n\n296\n00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.841\n>> Yeah, but I mean,\nI guess that's how everything works.\n\n297\n00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:41.974\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n298\n00:14:41.974 --> 00:14:45.092\nonce it, but what it really\ndid it became the precedent.\n\n299\n00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:47.350\nIt became, that's just what you do.\n\n300\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.050\n>> That defacto standard we talked about,\nyes.\n\n301\n00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.400\n>> Yeah, and kinda like, I'm sure that's\na lot of stuff that happens in tech.\n\n302\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.150\nYou know, one company creates it, and\nthat just becomes, that's what you use.\n\n303\n00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.650\n>> Yes.\n\n304\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:59.800\n>> Everybody does it, and so then it's\nlike okay, so Apple didn't necessarily\n\n305\n00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.920\ncreate if you wanna say, open type, but\nthey're like okay this actually works so\n\n306\n00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.020\nwe're gonna go ahead and be like,\nyeah we'll get on the open type game.\n\n307\n00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.100\nAnd everybody uses open type now, but\nit is very important to understand\n\n308\n00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.320\nthe differentiation when you're choosing\nfonts or either you're buying fonts or\n\n309\n00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.660\ninstalling fonts from wherever you're at.\n\n310\n00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.050\nIs it a true type font?\n\n311\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.140\nIs it an open type font?\n\n312\n00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.930\nAnd the open type font actually has\nan extra layer, if you want to say.\n\n313\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.110\nBut then just being available for\none operates versus the other.\n\n314\n00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.573\nIt actually extended\nthe font format to allow for\n\n315\n00:15:34.573 --> 00:15:37.368\nmore characters than a true type font.\n\n316\n00:15:37.368 --> 00:15:41.208\nIt allows you to have 65,536 characters.\n\n317\n00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:41.826\n>> Wow.\n\n318\n00:15:41.826 --> 00:15:47.383\n>> Does that numbers sound\n>> That sounds like 816 bits.\n\n319\n00:15:47.383 --> 00:15:52.351\n>> I was actually thinking back in what\nwas Office 2003, that that was the number\n\n320\n00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:55.890\nof The maximum number of rows\nyou can have in an Excel file.\n\n321\n00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:56.650\n>> It was, it was.\n\n322\n00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.970\n>> And it does go back to that\ntechnical term of 8 bits and-\n\n323\n00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:01.660\n>> 16 bits, exactly.\n\n324\n00:16:02.665 --> 00:16:03.530\n[LAUGH] Very good.\n\n325\n00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.700\n>> So that's what you got, little\ntech trivia for your OpenType fonts.\n\n326\n00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.290\nSo it actually allows for more characters,\nnot just upper and lowercase.\n\n327\n00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.770\nYou're talking about different languages,\n\n328\n00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:18.750\ndifferent ways that you can\nshow the characters of a font.\n\n329\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.580\nAnd to demonstrate that,\n\n330\n00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.820\nI have some more notes down here of\nwhat is the anatomy of an OpenType font.\n\n331\n00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.635\nIt's just a big old blank because I\nwanted to say [SOUND] you have all of\n\n332\n00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:30.745\nthese things.\n\n333\n00:16:30.745 --> 00:16:35.179\nAnd this gets in to a little bit of\nterminology that comes along with\n\n334\n00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:36.850\ntypography in general.\n\n335\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.700\nSo, in an open type font,\nyou can have Ligatures.\n\n336\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.760\nOkay now there's.\n\n337\n00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.750\nYeah that's a fun word.\n\n338\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.082\nI saw your face.\n\n339\n00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:49.838\n[LAUGH] You're over there going whoa.\n\n340\n00:16:49.838 --> 00:16:51.053\nSo, ligatures.\n\n341\n00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:52.790\nWell, us living in Florida.\n\n342\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.350\nI mean we kind of get\nthis a decent amount.\n\n343\n00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.990\nIs like, your F and your L,\nthey can kind of combine together.\n\n344\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.860\nRight?\n\n345\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:06.650\nWell that's like an actual stylistic\npreference, if you wanted it to be.\n\n346\n00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.580\nIn this version right here that I have,\nthis is actually two characters,\n\n347\n00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.060\nthis is an f and an l.\n\n348\n00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.140\nWhat a ligature does\nis it actually creates\n\n349\n00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.490\ncertain letter combinations\nthat become one character.\n\n350\n00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.480\nThis is not an f and a l, this is one.\n\n351\n00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.230\n>> So within that font they would\nhave an f, they would have an l and\n\n352\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.394\nthey'd have this combo character.\n\n353\n00:17:26.394 --> 00:17:27.507\n>> A ligature, correct.\n\n354\n00:17:27.507 --> 00:17:28.134\n>> A ligature.\n\n355\n00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:29.140\n>> A ligature.\n\n356\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.720\nAnd you don't see it in all\nyour letter combinations,\n\n357\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.830\nonly specific combinations\nthat you can create ligatures.\n\n358\n00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.960\nWhy?\nBecause it just looks different.\n\n359\n00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.170\nI mean this is really when you get down\non it, this is stylistic purposes.\n\n360\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.900\nDo you want ligatures or not?\n\n361\n00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:49.030\nDo you want some other things that we got\ngoing down here and what an open type font\n\n362\n00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.820\ncan create and it goes along\nwith just topography in general?\n\n363\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.694\nSo you can see that f i here and\nf i there,\n\n364\n00:17:54.694 --> 00:17:57.890\none character versus two characters.\n\n365\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:02.890\nOkay, now discretionary ligatures,\nnotice how it kinda puts these?\n\n366\n00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.570\nAgain, if you start really looking around,\nyou look at books and\n\n367\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.050\nyou look at different things,\nyou'll see this everywhere.\n\n368\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.790\nWell, maybe not everywhere, but\n\n369\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.590\nyou will start noticing hey,\nthat's a discretionary ligature.\n\n370\n00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.978\nAnd people will be like,\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n371\n00:18:14.978 --> 00:18:15.520\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.630\n>> So again, very few letter combinations,\n\n373\n00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.320\nbut you have different ways\nthat letters can be together,\n\n374\n00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.480\nit makes this kind of loopy thing on this.\n\n375\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.210\nNow, does that mean every single font\nhas these features of an open type font?\n\n376\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.602\nNo, not every font has discretionary\nligatures where it has the s and\n\n377\n00:18:34.602 --> 00:18:39.130\nthe t that can be combined into this\nlittle hoop thing, or together.\n\n378\n00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.890\nIt's all about whether the font allows it.\n\n379\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.380\nOkay, so\nI just wanted to point that out right now.\n\n380\n00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.430\nNow I actually have, that being said,\n\n381\n00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:52.070\nI couldn't find a font to talk\nabout contextual ligatures.\n\n382\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.840\nI actually couldn't find it in there.\n\n383\n00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.590\nSo I cheated, [LAUGH].\n\n384\n00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.500\nThis is actually I made a little path.\n\n385\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.825\n>> Connecting the i and the n.\n\n386\n00:19:00.825 --> 00:19:03.280\n[LAUGH] Because that's\nhow it was demonstrating\n\n387\n00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.570\nin different demonstrations of what are\ncontextual ligature, so I had to cheat,\n\n388\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.830\ncuz I could not find-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.860\n>> I was searching and\n\n390\n00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.235\nsearching for you all.\n\n391\n00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:12.345\nI couldn't find a font that.\n\n392\n00:19:12.345 --> 00:19:13.975\n>> Not quite as common then?\n\n393\n00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:16.025\n>> No.\nSo I had to cheat it.\n\n394\n00:19:16.025 --> 00:19:20.285\nBut there is something known as a\ncontextual ligature and an open type font.\n\n395\n00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:21.985\nOkay.\nA few other things.\n\n396\n00:19:21.985 --> 00:19:23.365\nWhat your small caps.\n\n397\n00:19:23.365 --> 00:19:26.830\nYou can have small caps,\nit kinda explains itself.\n\n398\n00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.580\nIt's capital letters, but\nthey're not big, okay?\n\n399\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.870\nThey're small.\n\n400\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.880\nOrdinals, this is something\nthat actually happens.\n\n401\n00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.340\nHave you ever done emails and\nthere's things where you start typing, and\n\n402\n00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.190\nit does the-\n>> A lot of our later\n\n403\n00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.640\nprograms, absolutely.\n\n404\n00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.070\n>> Yeah, what is?\n\n405\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.050\nExponents.\n\n406\n00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.820\n>> It kinda gives you when\nit's not a superscript.\n\n407\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:50.040\n>> Wow,\nI'm doing an episode on topography and\n\n408\n00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.520\nI can't even figure out\nwhat the superscript is.\n\n409\n00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.610\nYes, sorry, yes.\n\n410\n00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.600\nBut it does it automatically, but this is\nsomething known in the topography world,\n\n411\n00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.650\nthat's ordinals.\n\n412\n00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.590\nOkay, first, second words,\nyou're displaying the, nd, and\n\n413\n00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.770\nthe, st, in the [LAUGH] superscript\ninstead of straight across.\n\n414\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.350\nYou also have something known as Swashes.\n\n415\n00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.150\nSwashes, fancy A, boring A,\nboring B, fancy B.\n\n416\n00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.990\nWhy?\nIt just adds a little flair.\n\n417\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.800\n>> I see that a lot of\ntimes in certain books,\n\n418\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.380\nfancier books where that first letter of\nthat first paragraph on that page might be\n\n419\n00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.780\nlarger than everything else and\nit gets a little fancy.\n\n420\n00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.270\n>> Yes and you actually just threw in\nsomething else that we haven't covered,\n\n421\n00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.140\nthat's drop caps, to where like\nthe letters actually bigger and\n\n422\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.250\nit goes across a couple of lines.\n\n423\n00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.000\nThat's actually something known as\ndrop caps, the paragraph format,\n\n424\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.340\nthe character format, but\nthat's ok, we'll get to it, but.\n\n425\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.315\n>> Okay.\n>> Good demonstration.\n\n426\n00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:45.410\n[LAUGH] They also have the font, remember\nwe're talking about an OpenType font.\n\n427\n00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.620\nIt could have a stylistic set to where,\nagain, just a little bit more fancy,\n\n428\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.120\nk versus k.\n\n429\n00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:56.330\nIf you want a little bit more of a leg,\nor a non-leg, and then ornaments,\n\n430\n00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:01.720\nyou actually have, that's a character\nwithin this particular font.\n\n431\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.540\nAnd if I remember correct, yes,\nthis is an Adobe Garamond Pro.\n\n432\n00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.750\nSo, this is an ornament within that font,\n\n433\n00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.180\nbecause Adobe Garamond Pro\nis an open type font.\n\n434\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.690\nSo you have the options of all of this.\n\n435\n00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.760\nAnd the other thing that the OpenType\nfonts will do is how it treats figures and\n\n436\n00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.346\nfractions, figures meaning numbers.\n\n437\n00:21:20.346 --> 00:21:25.940\nFractions here versus here, okay.\n\n438\n00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.090\nSo you have that.\n\n439\n00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.150\nAnd each font, of course, is going to show\nyour fractions a little bit differently,\n\n440\n00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.010\nthis again is Garamond Pro.\n\n441\n00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:36.870\nAnd then how it treats your letters,\nsorry figures.\n\n442\n00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.720\nIt's almost like\nthe monospace a little bit.\n\n443\n00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.180\nBut it's closer to that but\n\n444\n00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:47.155\nit's really lining up your decimal\npoints to where it finds that.\n\n445\n00:21:47.155 --> 00:21:49.355\nAnd then it also has\nthe old style numbers.\n\n446\n00:21:49.355 --> 00:21:52.365\nThis is almost like, you see\nthe numbers on the sides of houses?\n\n447\n00:21:52.365 --> 00:21:53.215\n>> Yes.\n>> Right?\n\n448\n00:21:53.215 --> 00:21:57.190\nLike at the hardware store,\nyou can actually buy that looks this way.\n\n449\n00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.345\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> That's what they call\n\n450\n00:21:58.345 --> 00:21:59.490\nold style figures.\n\n451\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.370\nSo these are all the different things and\n\n452\n00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.900\nfeatures you can have\nwith an open type font.\n\n453\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.050\nTrue type fonts you\nwon't get any of these,\n\n454\n00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.920\nit's just going to have your regular,\nI think it was like 256 characters?\n\n455\n00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.190\nDon't quote me on that particular\nnumber that you could have, but\n\n456\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.440\nI know 256 goes to all out our eight bits.\n\n457\n00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.460\n>> Go back to eight bits.\n\n458\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.020\n>> Yeah, Yeah, there you go.\n\n459\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just a few more things here.\n\n460\n00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.130\nWhen you have fonts, your font has\nto be installed on your computer.\n\n461\n00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.010\nI have certain fonts on this computer that\nI know you don't have on this computer.\n\n462\n00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.430\nBecause I've either purchased them,\nI've downloaded them,\n\n463\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.300\nor I've got it from like maybe\na company I was working for.\n\n464\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.850\nBecause if I am working and\ndoing freelancing for a company,\n\n465\n00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.730\nthey might have specific fonts that they\nuse in all of their marking material.\n\n466\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.350\nWell, they need to give that to me,\n\n467\n00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.840\nand so I can be able to use that\nparticular branded font that they have.\n\n468\n00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.830\nSo, you do have to have like\nthe permission to use that font and\n\n469\n00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.740\nyou will get the warning,\n\n470\n00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.820\nlike hey make sure you have the right\nlicenses to be able to use this font.\n\n471\n00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:07.360\nAnd that's where you can purchase fonts\nfrom what they call font foundries.\n\n472\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.130\nThere's companies that make specific\nfonts where you have to buy them.\n\n473\n00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:16.190\nLike I, like ad agents,\nwill purchase large amounts of fonts.\n\n474\n00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.840\nI mean, I have a lot of designer\nfriends that they're like, for\n\n475\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.890\nChristmas, you know what my boss got me?\n\n476\n00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.075\nThey got me 200 new fonts.\n\n477\n00:23:22.075 --> 00:23:24.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And to me I'm like, that's amazing.\n\n478\n00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.280\nAnd people are like,\nyou got fonts for Christmas, really?\n\n479\n00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.040\nBut it's a huge thing,\nbecause there's so many to choose from.\n\n480\n00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.320\nYou run out of your options.\n\n481\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.355\nWhen you get 200 new licensed fonts that\nwere purchased for you, that's awesome.\n\n482\n00:23:37.355 --> 00:23:38.760\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n483\n00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.146\n>> Okay, I'm a little bit of a,\n\n484\n00:23:40.146 --> 00:23:41.039\n[LAUGH] a font geek.\n\n485\n00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:41.539\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n486\n00:23:41.539 --> 00:23:44.154\n[LAUGH] But kind of going back to that is,\n\n487\n00:23:44.154 --> 00:23:49.387\nthey aren't computer and file specific,\nso if I'm using fonts in this file,\n\n488\n00:23:49.387 --> 00:23:54.223\nAnd I have specific installed fonts\non my computer, and I send it to you,\n\n489\n00:23:54.223 --> 00:23:57.390\nand you don't have those fonts.\nAnd you open this file up,\n\n490\n00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:59.000\nyou're gonna be like.\nIt's gonna say,\n\n491\n00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.910\nhey you don't have this font.\n\n492\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.180\nAnd your application is going to tell you,\nIllustrator is going to be like, hey,\n\n493\n00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.570\nshe was using font blah blah blah and\n\n494\n00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.800\nyou don't have blah blah blah so I can't\nshow you what it actually looks like.\n\n495\n00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.770\n>> That's a very expensive one,\nblah blah blah.\n\n496\n00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:15.641\nI looked it up.\n\n497\n00:24:15.641 --> 00:24:16.980\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n[LAUGH] You should ask for\n\n498\n00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.621\nit for Christmas.\n\n499\n00:24:17.621 --> 00:24:20.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yes, you need to make sure that,\n\n500\n00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:26.860\nif you are sending files to somebody else,\nyou need to send the fonts with the file.\n\n501\n00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.270\nSo that way they know when they open it,\nokay, I can install this font.\n\n502\n00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.000\nThey're all over the place.\n\n503\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.660\n>> I might be jumping the gun a little\nbit, but is that a save option?\n\n504\n00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.620\nWhen you save the file you\ncan say to include the fonts?\n\n505\n00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.220\nAre we gonna get to that later?\n\n506\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.589\n>> There is an option that you can do\nthat and that's known as packaging.\n\n507\n00:24:44.589 --> 00:24:48.060\nWhich is packaging, think of,\nif I'm packaging this file for\n\n508\n00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.100\nyou, I'm basically putting it up into\na nice little box with a little bow on it,\n\n509\n00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.330\nthat's gonna give you everything\nyou need for that file for you.\n\n510\n00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.900\nAnd that's not just going\nto package your fonts,\n\n511\n00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.560\nit's also gonna package your images.\n\n512\n00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.170\nBut we're not talking about images in this\nepisode, we have other ones in there.\n\n513\n00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.260\nBut that feature does work,\nand it's really great.\n\n514\n00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:10.050\nAnd packaging used to not\nbe an Illustrator feature.\n\n515\n00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.510\nIt was only in InDesign.\n\n516\n00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.384\nAnd then when they added it into\nIllustrator, I was like, [SOUND].\n\n517\n00:25:14.384 --> 00:25:15.810\nI was so excited.\n\n518\n00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:16.970\n>> What was your other option then?\n\n519\n00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.560\nActually get the font file and\n\n520\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.530\nsend them that separate from\nthe artwork or the file?\n\n521\n00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.470\n>> Yeah, I would have to go into my fonts,\n\n522\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.760\nand actually get the fonts, and\nthen put them into a folder.\n\n523\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.660\nAnd then I make sure I get all my images\nand make sure I'm in the right place.\n\n524\n00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.590\nYeah, I would have to manually package\n>> Create this\n\n525\n00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.470\npackage\n>> Yeah, so\n\n526\n00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:35.472\n>> And explain to them how to\n\n527\n00:25:35.472 --> 00:25:36.895\ninstall the font and all that.\n\n528\n00:25:36.895 --> 00:25:40.090\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, and so\nthat's why, sometimes when,\n\n529\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.600\nback in the day, if I was choosing,\n>> am I gonna use Illustrator or\n\n530\n00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.830\nam I gonna use InDesign\nto do this document?\n\n531\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.990\nI would choose InDesign just\nbecause of the package feature,\n\n532\n00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.630\nwhen I really wanted to use Illustrator,\nbut it didn't have the package.\n\n533\n00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:58.460\nSo I actually avoided using the product\nfor that particular project.\n\n534\n00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.933\n>> Nice.\n>> So, I love packaging in Illustrator.\n\n535\n00:26:00.933 --> 00:26:02.366\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It's very awesome.\n\n536\n00:26:02.366 --> 00:26:03.919\nOkay, so let's move on.\n\n537\n00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:08.310\nJust a few more thing in\nour overview of typography.\n\n538\n00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.734\nThis is getting into type formatting.\n\n539\n00:26:10.734 --> 00:26:13.509\nAnd it breaks up into two different types.\n\n540\n00:26:13.509 --> 00:26:18.465\nYou can have character formatting and\nwe're gonna have paragraph formatting.\n\n541\n00:26:18.465 --> 00:26:23.035\nAgain we're just explaining the topics and\nthe ideas here and then we're gonna show\n\n542\n00:26:23.035 --> 00:26:26.010\nyou, in later episodes, how you\nactually change all of these things.\n\n543\n00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.060\nBut character formatting,\nthese are to the actual letters.\n\n544\n00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.730\nThere's things like\nletting kerning tracking.\n\n545\n00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.480\nIts okay if you don't know what they mean,\nI'll show you.\n\n546\n00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.220\nBut its to the actual letters.\n\n547\n00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.420\n>> Individual characters.\n\n548\n00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.760\n>> Yes, and\nindividual words within a paragraph.\n\n549\n00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.670\nNow, paragraph level formatting would\nbe left aligned, right aligned,\n\n550\n00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:47.990\ncenter aligned.\n\n551\n00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.323\nThe spaces before or\nafter paragraphs, like full,\n\n552\n00:26:51.323 --> 00:26:55.210\nactual paragraphs where you type and\nthen you hit enter.\n\n553\n00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:59.490\nWhen you hit enter, you're making a\nparagraph, as opposed to just type, space,\n\n554\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.980\ntype, space, type, space.\n\n555\n00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.035\nThose are your characters\nwithin the paragraph.\n\n556\n00:27:03.035 --> 00:27:07.410\nAnd so\nthere's different levels of formatting.\n\n557\n00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.195\nParagraph level formatting, or\ncharacter level formatting.\n\n558\n00:27:11.195 --> 00:27:12.065\nAnd see?\n\n559\n00:27:12.065 --> 00:27:14.165\nDrop tabs, remember talking about that?\n\n560\n00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:15.160\nYou must have read my notes.\n\n561\n00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.470\n>> [LAUGH] I was looking\nover your shoulder there.\n\n562\n00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.870\n>> [LAUGH] No you didn't.\n\n563\n00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.205\n[LAUGH] But that's great, I'm so\nglad that you actually brought that up.\n\n564\n00:27:22.205 --> 00:27:27.168\nOkay and then another thing,\na concept of formatting with formatting\n\n565\n00:27:27.168 --> 00:27:30.460\nour text is you can use\nthings known as styles.\n\n566\n00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.570\nRemember we talked about swatches.\n\n567\n00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.470\nWith swatches where you could go ahead and\nI want that, I want that swatch,\n\n568\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.720\nbe able to apply it everywhere I want.\n\n569\n00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.100\nIt's almost like swatches for text.\n\n570\n00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.160\nIt's where you can use your formatting.\n\n571\n00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:48.380\nIt's a collection of formatting that\nyou can then apply in one quick step.\n\n572\n00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:54.300\nOkay, so something that I want all\nof my paragraphs to be left-aligned,\n\n573\n00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.620\nsix point space after, and no hyphenation.\n\n574\n00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.995\nMake that a style, and\nI can [NOISE] just click it.\n\n575\n00:28:00.995 --> 00:28:02.267\n>> And, the other cool thing,\n\n576\n00:28:02.267 --> 00:28:05.606\nis that it's attached to the style You\nchange the style, it can go ahead and\n\n577\n00:28:05.606 --> 00:28:08.210\napply to all the places where\nyou have that style applied.\n\n578\n00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.090\nKinda like a global swatches,\nwe're talking about swatches.\n\n579\n00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.810\n>> Convenient.\n\n580\n00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:12.690\n>> Very convenient.\n\n581\n00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.110\nI love styles, and\ndoing full textbook layouts,\n\n582\n00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.790\nI'm formatting a book\nthat's over 200 pages.\n\n583\n00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.730\nYeah.\nI'm going\n\n584\n00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:25.370\nto use some styles because if I go back\nand I go to the person, you know what?\n\n585\n00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:29.332\nI really want that headline to\nbe about three points smaller.\n\n586\n00:28:29.332 --> 00:28:31.550\n>> [LAUGH] How many places\nhave you used that?\n\n587\n00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.209\nYes.\n>> Yeah, I better have a style.\n\n588\n00:28:33.209 --> 00:28:37.000\n[LAUGH] Because all I've got to do is\nchange it in the style and it's done.\n\n589\n00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.600\nReally great.\n\n590\n00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.910\nOkay, so styles.\n\n591\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:44.240\nI will tell you that, in Illustrator\nspecifically, styles are a little wonky.\n\n592\n00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.860\nThey're not as fluid\nas styles in InDesign.\n\n593\n00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.980\nThey work.\n\n594\n00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.840\nThey're just a little\nbit more temperamental.\n\n595\n00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.850\nAt least for me, being somebody\nthat uses InDesign a lot and\n\n596\n00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.050\nuses styles like nobody's business.\n\n597\n00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.320\nWhen I have to go to Illustrator,\n\n598\n00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:05.000\nI have to remember the little quirks\nthat Illustrator has with styles.\n\n599\n00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.170\nBut I'll show you,\nI'll try to point them out.\n\n600\n00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:12.390\nAnd the last little part that I wanted\nto go over is Show Hidden Characters.\n\n601\n00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:16.910\nParagraph formatting and\ncharacter formatting, where is it at?\n\n602\n00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.530\nAnd if you've ever been in a file, where,\n\n603\n00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.060\nif you move something over,\nyour just space,\n\n604\n00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.910\nspace, space, space, space, space, space,-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n605\n00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:27.120\n>> And, yes, I'm sure I do it too.\n\n606\n00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.795\nBut, how do I know when there's a line\nbreak, or a space, or a character term?\n\n607\n00:29:31.795 --> 00:29:33.578\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I call them character terms,\n\n608\n00:29:33.578 --> 00:29:37.030\nlike the enters,\nshowing hidden characters?\n\n609\n00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.690\n>> In Illustrator specifically,\n\n610\n00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.200\nthat's in your Type menu,\nthat Show Hidden Characters.\n\n611\n00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.500\nIt's in all of your products,\nyou just have to know where to find it.\n\n612\n00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.435\nIt's in Word, okay.\n\n613\n00:29:46.435 --> 00:29:47.720\n>> Mm-Hm.\n\n614\n00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.620\n>> I love Word, so there we go.\n\n615\n00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:55.190\nNow you can see that it is showing\nthings that are actually in the type,\n\n616\n00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.890\nthey're not displaying.\n\n617\n00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.530\nIt's the non-printing,\nor non-displaying, or\n\n618\n00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.600\nactually, it's non-printing,\nI should really clarify that.\n\n619\n00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.600\nIt's the non-printing\ncharacters within the text.\n\n620\n00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.620\nSo you can see, right here,\nthat I know that is a full paragraph\n\n621\n00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.430\nand that is a line-break,\nthat's not a paragraph.\n\n622\n00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.900\nSo if I was trying to apply paragraphable\nformatting of space after and\n\n623\n00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.390\nI couldn't understand why was\nit not spacing after line-break.\n\n624\n00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.640\nI think that's a new line.\n\n625\n00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.810\nIt's not a new paragraph,\nit's a new line within a paragraph.\n\n626\n00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.690\nIt is not an Enter,\nit's a Shift+Enter, it's a line break.\n\n627\n00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:38.190\nAnd how do I know when somebody's done\na whole bunch of spaces versus using tabs?\n\n628\n00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:43.590\nBecause if I'm trying to format tab stops\nwith a document that doesn't have tabs,\n\n629\n00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:44.730\nits not going to do anything.\n\n630\n00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.200\nSo that's really, really helpful.\n\n631\n00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.010\nI pretty much always have non-printing\n\n632\n00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:56.055\nhidden characters when I'm doing\nextensive text formatting.\n\n633\n00:30:56.055 --> 00:30:57.740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because I need this.\n\n634\n00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.830\nI live in this world when\nI'm doing text layouts.\n\n635\n00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.540\nAnd it's everything for me.\n\n636\n00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.370\n>> Right.\n\n637\n00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:06.980\n>> When I do that.\n\n638\n00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.510\nSo, that is my Typography 101.\n\n639\n00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.540\n>> All right, Vaughn, again,\na lot of information about fonts.\n\n640\n00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.974\nI bet some of you, including me,\ndidn't realize there was that much to\n\n641\n00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:18.620\nlearn about Typography and\nwere not done yet, right?\n\n642\n00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.250\nWe've got more to do, but that's gonna\ndo it for this particular episode.\n\n643\n00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.230\nWe hope everybody enjoyed

at IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:18.920\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.990\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at missing fonts and\n\n6\n00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.180\ntype kits.\n\n7\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.972\nAnd I'm apparently missing\nthe entire concept.\n\n8\n00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:31.255\nI have no idea what the heck that means.\n\n9\n00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:33.830\nSo luckily for us I have with us here Mrs.\n\n10\n00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.443\nVon Smith who's going to\nhelp us figure this out.\n\n11\n00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:39.150\n>> [LAUGH] Hello.\n\n12\n00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.190\nThank you for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.236\nYes, I am here to fill in\nthe missing pieces for you Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:43.752\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n15\n00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:48.591\nWe're gonna dive a little bit more into\nfonts on your machine and a very common\n\n16\n00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:53.589\nproblem that can come up with fonts,\nbecause there are so many fonts out there.\n\n17\n00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.720\nThe fonts that you have on your computer,\nthe fonts that I have on my computer.\n\n18\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.300\nAre going to be completely different\nbecause I've already been looking for\n\n19\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.120\nfonts elsewhere.\n\n20\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.350\nI've found some free fonts,\n\n21\n00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.190\nI have some fonts from different projects\nthat I've worked and so I'm gonna have\n\n22\n00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.680\na completely different collection of\nfonts than you will, or anybody else.\n\n23\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.050\nOr if I'm working on my Windows\nmachine those have different fonts.\n\n24\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.250\nSo this is a very common thing that you're\ngoing to run into in Illustrator, so\n\n25\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.420\nI wanted to dedicate an entire\nepisode just to this whole concept.\n\n26\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.608\nSo let me fill you in on that-\n\n27\n00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:30.386\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n28\n00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:33.870\n>> [LAUGH] So, I have, I just\nfigured I'd just jump right into it.\n\n29\n00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.770\nSo, I made a quick little Illustrator\nfile on my Windows machine.\n\n30\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.890\nNow, there are Windows fonts that\ndon't show up on a Mac by default.\n\n31\n00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.410\nSo, what am I going to do if I'm kinda\nswitching back and forth from it.\n\n32\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.395\nSo, let me just kinda jump right in so you\ncan see it, and I'll explain it as we go.\n\n33\n00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:56.330\nSo, I have this file\ncalled missingfonts.ai.\n\n34\n00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.870\nSo when I open up an illustrator,\n\n35\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.630\nit's going to give me right away this\nwarning that says hey, wait a second.\n\n36\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.020\nI'm seeing that you have a font\ndoesn't exist in this document.\n\n37\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.900\nThat I don't have the font, too, so\nI don't know what to do with it.\n\n38\n00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.270\nSo it's actually gonna show me\nright here the missing fonts\n\n39\n00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.250\ndialog box which you can bring up later,\nI'll show you that, too.\n\n40\n00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.850\nBut It also shows that you have a missing\nfont because it is highlighted in pink.\n\n41\n00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.890\nIt's got this kind of\npink highlight on it.\n\n42\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.100\nThat's not the format.\n\n43\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.660\nThat is just Illustrator's\nway of showing you that\n\n44\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.630\nthis font doesn't exist in your computer.\n\n45\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.790\nThis will also be the same\nIn Design by the way.\n\n46\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.260\nSo it's always gonna be that way.\n\n47\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.120\nIt's letting me know right\nhere that you are missing\n\n48\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.635\nCooper Black which is actually one of\nmy favorite fonts on a Windows machine.\n\n49\n00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:42.758\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I picked that on purpose.\n\n50\n00:02:42.758 --> 00:02:43.942\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:45.285\n>> So, it's telling me,\n\n52\n00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:48.390\nnow at this point right here,\nis just letting me know.\n\n53\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.360\nNow, there are things that I could do.\n\n54\n00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.510\nFor what I wanna show you is I wanna\nshow you that I want this font.\n\n55\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.960\nSo I actually have the font,\nI'm gonna install it on the machine, so\n\n56\n00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.100\nyou can see that once you install it,\nit's going to, like, there is no problems.\n\n57\n00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.435\nBut if you didn't have that option,\nlet's say I don't have that font,\n\n58\n00:03:07.435 --> 00:03:08.594\nnobody sent me the font.\n\n59\n00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:13.329\nYou can actually go through here, and\nwhen I click that Find Fonts button,\n\n60\n00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.640\nit's gonna give me the option\nof actually exchanging a font.\n\n61\n00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.630\nAnd saying all right, it came in with\nCooper Black, if you had something close\n\n62\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.810\nto it, which I don't, but\nif I had something close, you know what?\n\n63\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.260\nI'll just forgo Cooper Black altogether,\n\n64\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.630\nI could replace it with\ndifferent fonts in my system.\n\n65\n00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.080\nSo it's up here showing you\nfonts that are in this document,\n\n66\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.610\nthat little warning signs,\nit's not in there.\n\n67\n00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.410\nAnd it's saying well let's replace\nCooper Black with Copper Plate or\n\n68\n00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.020\nsomething close to it.\n\n69\n00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.540\nSo you do have that option\nif you didn't have the font.\n\n70\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.770\nSo I'm trying to give you like,\n\n71\n00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.360\nAll the options you've got going on\nin here if you don't have that font.\n\n72\n00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.040\nSo I could say, yeah go ahead and change\nall Cooper Black instances to this copper\n\n73\n00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.550\nplate, and then you've solved your problem\nof the missing font within this document.\n\n74\n00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.030\nSo that is one option.\n\n75\n00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.160\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust click Done for now.\n\n76\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.320\nAnd just to kinda give you,\n\n77\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.200\nI didn't wanna commit to changing\nout Cooper for Copperplate.\n\n78\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.210\nCuz I just wanted to quickly go through\nand show you that I did actually\n\n79\n00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.900\nbring the font over with that document,\nbecause I packaged the file.\n\n80\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.630\nAnd I had mentioned that in the typography\nepisode I believe, before or\n\n81\n00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.470\nmaybe some other places.\n\n82\n00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.080\nBut I'll tell you now,\nlike what is package?\n\n83\n00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.610\nIt's like you're taking everything\nthat's in your document and\n\n84\n00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.810\nmaking one nice little package for\nyou to then transport.\n\n85\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.690\nIt will copy over the fonts, it'll copy\nover any of your external images and\n\n86\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.310\nit's a great way to hand off files to\nanother computer, another person, or\n\n87\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.820\nprint provider, so on and so forth.\n\n88\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.910\nSo, I have in this folder here,\nmissing fonts folder,\n\n89\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.290\nis I actually have that font in here.\n\n90\n00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.034\nThis is, sorry, I went a little fast.\n\n91\n00:04:54.034 --> 00:04:56.621\n[LAUGH] Sorry about that.\n\n92\n00:04:56.621 --> 00:05:02.442\nThis is the result of the packaged file\nthat I have, and it makes a little folder.\n\n93\n00:05:02.442 --> 00:05:03.090\nIt actually zips it,\n\n94\n00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.963\nyou can see it in there,\nright over here that it's a zip file.\n\n95\n00:05:04.963 --> 00:05:11.060\nI unzipped it and so I have this, and\nin here it gave me the actual file, right?\n\n96\n00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.510\nMy missing fonts file, my text report like\nit's just in a txt file that just says or\n\n97\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.590\nreports for any problem that might\nhave come up when you packaged a file.\n\n98\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.630\nAnd then it gives me\na folder of the fonts.\n\n99\n00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.910\nSo in here I have my font and you can\nsee that there's that Cooper Black and\n\n100\n00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.960\nthere's that Broadway font.\n\n101\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.780\nCuz I had actually fixed half of\nthe problems in this file before this so\n\n102\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.680\nyou could kinda at least get an idea.\n\n103\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.540\nSo here's this font.\n\n104\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.610\nNow all I have to do is install\nthis font on my machine.\n\n105\n00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.880\nNow on a Mac, all you have to\ndo is go into Applications and\n\n106\n00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.430\nthen find your font book.\n\n107\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.960\nAnd I believe, Mike,\nhow do we do that in Windows?\n\n108\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.270\nIs it-\n>> There's a control panel aptly\n\n109\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.080\ncalled Fonts.\n\n110\n00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.880\nIf you have the category view going,\n\n111\n00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.910\nit's gonna be underneath Appearance and\nPersonalization, and\n\n112\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.350\nthen you can click on Fonts, and\nyou can see all the fonts you have.\n\n113\n00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.270\nAnd it'll give you the option\nto install wether.\n\n114\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.000\n>> Okay, that sounds\n>> So it's very similar.\n\n115\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.740\n>> Somewhat familiar.\n\n116\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.870\nActually, it's been a while since I've\nbeen on a Windows machine that I actually\n\n117\n00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.360\nhad to install fonts for a while, but\nI thought I was something different.\n\n118\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.500\n>> Way back in the day,\n>> But I'll take your word for it.\n\n119\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.350\n>> Yeah, way back in the day you actually\nhad to dive into your Windows directory\n\n120\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.130\nand find the folder where all\nthose font files were stored, and\n\n121\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.920\nyou could copy that file, what is it,\na TTF, or something, the text file.\n\n122\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.544\n>> The TTF would be a True type font, or\n\n123\n00:06:23.544 --> 00:06:25.830\nyou could do the OTF,\nwhich is the open type font.\n\n124\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.316\nAnd that's what I remember like\ngoing to system, user system,\n\n125\n00:06:30.316 --> 00:06:34.230\nsomething, fonts,\nas you can tell it's been a while.\n\n126\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.470\nSo I'm glad I have you here so\nyou can fill in that missing part for me.\n\n127\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.559\n>> There we go, I don't feel as bad.\n\n128\n00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:40.059\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:41.887\n>> Ok, so back here on my MAC,\n\n130\n00:06:41.887 --> 00:06:44.828\nif I just opened up two\ninstances of Finder so\n\n131\n00:06:44.828 --> 00:06:49.730\nyou can see that I've got my fonts here.\nActually, I have three instances, don't I?\n\n132\n00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.573\nThere's my cooper.\n\n133\n00:06:50.573 --> 00:06:54.507\nSo then all I gotta do is just drag and\ndrop it,\n\n134\n00:06:54.507 --> 00:06:57.626\nactually you need to put it in here.\n\n135\n00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:00.192\nThere we go.\n\n136\n00:07:00.192 --> 00:07:03.880\nSo bow I went ahead and\nit's installed, there we go.\n\n137\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.189\nI don't know why I actually don't\nknow where I dragged in before.\n\n138\n00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:08.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But anyways I got it right now.\n\n139\n00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.490\nI put it into this column and\n\n140\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.970\nnow I've got cooper black as\nan installed font on my machine.\n\n141\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:20.180\nSo what happens now is if I\ngo back to my files don't\n\n142\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.470\nworry about where I'm clicking you'll have\nthe place of where that file is later.\n\n143\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.380\nThere's my missing fonts.\n\n144\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.430\nSo, I'm gonna open up my\nIllustrator document.\n\n145\n00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.680\nAnd you can see now.\n\n146\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.640\nDon't have any problems, because now,\nCooper Black, my favorite font,\n\n147\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.210\nbecause it reminds me\nof the iron on letters.\n\n148\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.290\n>> Yes.\n>> I remember I actually had a shirt that\n\n149\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.950\nhad Vans spelled on it\n\n150\n00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.180\nbecause you can never find my name on\nany of those like a personalized items.\n\n151\n00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.450\nIt's like where's my name?\n\n152\n00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.630\nNo, it doesn't exist.\n\n153\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.525\nWe're talking up some childhood memories.\n\n154\n00:07:52.525 --> 00:07:54.800\n[LAUGH] We should probably move on.\n\n155\n00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.510\n>> Yes\n>> So\n\n156\n00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.460\nanyways that's what I've got going on\nhere and that was a quick easy fix.\n\n157\n00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.380\n>> So you got options there.\n\n158\n00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.250\nYou can either deal with not\nhaving the font if it's not that\n\n159\n00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.460\nimportant you can just\nuse an existing font.\n\n160\n00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.714\nOn your machine, substitute it out,\nand you can keep on trucking.\n\n161\n00:08:07.714 --> 00:08:11.261\nOr, if it was a font that you\nreally needed, that made or break,\n\n162\n00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:13.630\nthat make or break that project.\n\n163\n00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.970\nYou can go get it, buy it, download it, if\nit's, if it costs money or whatever, and\n\n164\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.175\nthen just install it,\nand you're good to go.\n\n165\n00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:20.530\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd especially if somebody has packaged\n\n166\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.270\nthat file for you, then they're going to\nbring over the fonts for you very nicely.\n\n167\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.420\nSo that's what I do with all day long.\n\n168\n00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:28.970\n>> All right.\n\n169\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.700\nSo now we gotta deal\nwith the missing fonts.\n\n170\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.340\nNow you've gotta to explain to\nus what the heck a type kit is.\n\n171\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.090\n>> Yes.\n\n172\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.400\nOkay, I like you're saying a type kit,\nit's actually just type kit.\n\n173\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.770\n>> Okay.\n>> It's actually something that you have\n\n174\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:49.710\nas a subscriber to the Adobe Creative\ncloud license like when you buy\n\n175\n00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.840\nthe creative suite you get that part\nof that Adobe allows you to do,\n\n176\n00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.060\nit's called type kit.\n\n177\n00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.660\nIt's really their place that you\ncould install and use Fonts.\n\n178\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.550\n>> So\nit's like they're giving you licenses.\n\n179\n00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.690\n>> Like a font catalogue.\n\n180\n00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.550\n>> Yeah, kinda like a font founder that\nwe were talking about in typography,\n\n181\n00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.380\nit's like their font foundry if\nyou wanna say to where it allows\n\n182\n00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.320\nyou to use fonts through Adobe.\n\n183\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.240\nAnd it's pretty handy and\nthey got a lot of cool stuff.\n\n184\n00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.090\nSo I just wanted to show you where that's,\nat, and\n\n185\n00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.370\nI also just wanted to bring up two\nthings in the Adobe help files for\n\n186\n00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.360\nyou to just be aware of when\nyou're using type kit fonts.\n\n187\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.780\nSo, where do we find it?\n\n188\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.810\nYou could, well there's a website\nit's gonna go to, but if you're\n\n189\n00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:40.365\nin any of your Adobe applications, if you\nfind the character panel, or in this sense\n\n190\n00:09:40.365 --> 00:09:44.470\nin Illustrator you go to the type menu,\nyou can see add fonts from type kit.\n\n191\n00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:50.030\nSo if I click on that, that's gonna take\nme out on that online to the typekit.com.\n\n192\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.490\nI thought that's what it is, but then I\nwas like maybe it's something different.\n\n193\n00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.750\nJust in case, so\nit's actually bringing me out.\n\n194\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.280\nIt's connected to my\ncreative cloud subscription.\n\n195\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.910\nSo it knows that okay you're in\nhere because you're signed in.\n\n196\n00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.460\nAnd if you're not you can\nalways just sign in up there.\n\n197\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.110\nAnd you can just search for\nwhatever font you want in type kit.\n\n198\n00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.820\nAnd it's kinda neat cuz you\ncan do a preview right here.\n\n199\n00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.190\nI typed in my name so you can see that\nany font that you're looking for,\n\n200\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.710\nit's actually gonna show you what the font\nwill look like in that particular letter.\n\n201\n00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:24.050\nSo if you're looking for a headline, and\nyou're looking for that specific look and\n\n202\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.320\nfeel that you want that headline to be\nbased on the font that you're choosing,\n\n203\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.310\nit actually shows you it.\n\n204\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.130\nAnd it gives you the different types San\nserif and serif, or feet and no feet.\n\n205\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.070\nDo you want scripty font?\n\n206\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.930\nScript, sorry.\n\n207\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.140\nI like to add Ys on the end of everything.\n\n208\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.030\nDecorative fonts, those types of things.\n\n209\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.390\nSo it's nice to be able\nto show your preview, and\n\n210\n00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.770\nyou can kinda make it bigger or\nsmaller, so you can get a better idea.\n\n211\n00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.850\n>> Extremely handy.\n\n212\n00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.353\nRather than download one, try it, don't\nlike it, go back, get another one, try it.\n\n213\n00:10:50.353 --> 00:10:53.873\n>> And a lot of,\nthere is plenty of other places and\n\n214\n00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:57.321\nwebsites and\nplaces where you can find fonts.\n\n215\n00:10:57.321 --> 00:10:59.430\nOr purchase fonts for\nfree or for purchase,\n\n216\n00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.350\nlike I said, that will do the same idea,\nyou have that preview.\n\n217\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.948\nBut it's really nice, because it\nshows you what it's going to be.\n\n218\n00:11:07.948 --> 00:11:11.660\nIt' not just like AB or\nthe quick fox jumped over brown.\n\n219\n00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.080\n>> The quick brown fox.\n\n220\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.960\n>> Yeah something with jump.\n\n221\n00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.030\n>> Jumped over the lazy dog.\n\n222\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.680\n>> Hey there you go.\n\n223\n00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So you could do that.\n\n224\n00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.030\nAnd if you just find it\nyou can just download it.\n\n225\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.030\nMaybe I like this kind of scriptie font.\n\n226\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.590\nAnd it goes for it and\nyou could just say use font.\n\n227\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.600\nAnd then it says do you want this,\nand like yes, I want to go ahead and\n\n228\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.730\nsync my my fonts.\n\n229\n00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.490\nAnd then it goes off and\ngives you your fonts.\n\n230\n00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.130\nSo it's pretty awesome.\n\n231\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.930\nI've used this a few times.\n\n232\n00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.309\nI've found some really neat fonts.\n\n233\n00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.950\nAnd you can use it.\n\n234\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.270\nAnd it's just gonna bring\nup in your Illustrator for\n\n235\n00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.750\na font that you can choose for\nyour later use.\n\n236\n00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.580\nNow, with that later use,\nI just did want to bring up two things\n\n237\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.660\nthat you should know that, of course,\nthe licensing of your fonts.\n\n238\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.780\nThat you need to make sure that\nyou you are allowed to use it, and\n\n239\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.360\nso if you just go to the Adobe help files.\n\n240\n00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.030\nAnd just type in font licensing, or\nactually just go to the Typekit Help.\n\n241\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.400\nCuz this is where I found it.\n\n242\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.860\nIt'll just give you a few little things.\n\n243\n00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.758\nSo it's just giving me some guidelines,\nbut you could see all Typekit Type ooh.\n\n244\n00:12:13.758 --> 00:12:17.705\n[LAUGH] I'm trying to read it to you,\nI'm not doing a very good job.\n\n245\n00:12:17.705 --> 00:12:21.635\nAll Typekit subscriptions include the same\nfont licensing whether you try it out for\n\n246\n00:12:21.635 --> 00:12:25.045\nour free plan, upgrade to\nthe paid Typekit subscription or\n\n247\n00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:26.855\nsubscribe to Creative Cloud.\n\n248\n00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:30.960\nSo you can see that it's, that gives you\nthe options, but just always double check\n\n249\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.060\nall of these things, can I use it in\nmy logo, can I use it in my website?\n\n250\n00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.490\nAnd it will let you know, so\n\n251\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.220\nit will say yes you can do this and\nno you can't do that.\n\n252\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.870\nSo just always watch that,\nyou always want to be on the right side,\n\n253\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.630\nrather than the wrong side.\n\n254\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.400\nSo I'm not gonna go over every single\none of those cuz you can go ahead and\n\n255\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.330\nlook that up.\n\n256\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.865\nAnd the other thing, since we talked about\npackaging, [COUGH] when packaging using\n\n257\n00:12:52.865 --> 00:12:57.740\nsynced fonts in your type kit,\nsynced fonts in Illustrator.\n\n258\n00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.570\nIt does say you do have to be\na little careful about that,\n\n259\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.840\nlike you really should if you're\nsending it to somebody else.\n\n260\n00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.990\nThey should have their own\ncreative cloud subscription and\n\n261\n00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.120\nhave their own downloaded\ncopy of that font to use.\n\n262\n00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.160\nAnd really just saying,\nyou know the best case scenario.\n\n263\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160\nReally what you're doing for\nprint output is you always make a PDF.\n\n264\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.710\nIs you always make that high quality PDF\nand we'll talk about that when we get into\n\n265\n00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.350\nour exporting options of\nyour illustrator file.\n\n266\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.710\nSo that's always the way to go but\n\n267\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.370\nyou always want that backup for\nhaving the font with the files.\n\n268\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.983\nBut, just be aware that and\njust know what it entails and just,\n\n269\n00:13:32.983 --> 00:13:35.085\nalways go to the help files.\n\n270\n00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:36.960\nWhen in doubt, go to the help files,\n>> That's true.\n\n271\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.617\n>> And\nthey're actually pretty helpful, so.\n\n272\n00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:40.780\n>> Always good, always good.\n\n273\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.990\nAlright Von, well we appreciate that,\nthank you for straightening us out on what\n\n274\n00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.500\nit means to have a missing font,\nand what the type kit is.\n\n275\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.560\nVery useful stuff there.\n\n276\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.890\nWe thank you hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching, signing off for\n\n277\n00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.310\nITPRO TV,\nI've been your host Mike

00:00:16.910\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.581\nAnd today,\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:24.403\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at character\n\n6\n00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:27.800\nformatting, as well as\nparagraph formatting.\n\n7\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.150\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.756\nHow are you doing, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:34.472\n>> Good, glad to be here to talk about\nwhat you just said, which is character and\n\n10\n00:00:34.472 --> 00:00:36.010\nparagraph formatting.\n\n11\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.100\nGotta make our text look\nthe way we want it to look.\n\n12\n00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.063\nAnd make sure our paragraphs look\nthe way we want our paragraphs to look.\n\n13\n00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:43.062\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n14\n00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:47.084\n>> Yes, so this is continuing on from\nthe concepts that we learned about in\n\n15\n00:00:47.084 --> 00:00:48.950\nthe typography lesson.\n\n16\n00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.340\nNow we're actually going to apply it.\n\n17\n00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.950\nWe're going to look at all\nof the different panels,\n\n18\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.250\nwhere you can find where to format,\nhow to format, what it means,\n\n19\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.400\nwhat it looks like, and then talk\na little bit about styles as well.\n\n20\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.230\nSo it's all about applying the formats.\n\n21\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.765\nWe haven't actually gone\nto adding the text yet or\n\n22\n00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:09.755\nwell, maybe you've already watched\nthe Adding the Text lesson.\n\n23\n00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:13.295\nBut the way I'm doing this is I'm kinda\ntalking about concepts, how to apply it,\n\n24\n00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:15.090\nand then we'll actually add the text, so\n\n25\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.504\nthat way, we're kind of designing\nbackwards, the way I always like to do it.\n\n26\n00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:19.072\n>> I like it.\n\n27\n00:01:19.072 --> 00:01:21.699\n>> All right, so let's jump right in and\n\n28\n00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:26.296\njust to recap some of the last little\nbit of the typography lesson is\n\n29\n00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:31.080\nthere are certain things that they\nconsider character formatting.\n\n30\n00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.390\nLike the actual letters and then the\nparagraphs, which would be where you hit\n\n31\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.210\nthat Enter mark, where you say yes,\nI want a new paragraph as I'm typing.\n\n32\n00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.029\nSo things like the letting and kerning,\nand so I'm gonna show you how that works.\n\n33\n00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:46.291\nBut the one thing I forgot to put in\nthis little list of character formatting\n\n34\n00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:50.351\nis the font, like actually choosing\nthe font, where do we go for that,\n\n35\n00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:52.280\nso let's start there.\n\n36\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.730\nI've got my black arrow tool cuz I do\nwant everything that's in this text box\n\n37\n00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.040\nto have formatting.\n\n38\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.170\nSo I mean, if I just clicked here,\n\n39\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.770\nit means all of the letters or\neverything in here is going to apply.\n\n40\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.040\nIf I only wanted like one word,\nyou would then, with the black arrow tool,\n\n41\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.190\njust double click to go ahead and get\nthe T tool to be able to select the text.\n\n42\n00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.382\nSo it's all about selective effects that\nstill applies here, but I'm just gonna\n\n43\n00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:23.211\nstay with the black arrow tool to just\nget the whole text frame, or text box.\n\n44\n00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:23.827\n>> Okay.\n\n45\n00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:28.682\n>> If you have a wider resolution monitor,\nyou will have across the top\n\n46\n00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:33.452\non your tool options bar,\nit will give you some fonts and character\n\n47\n00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:38.900\nbecause my resolution is a little bit\nlower to show on the screen here.\n\n48\n00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.320\nIt's not actually showing like\nthe dropdown, where I can choose a font or\n\n49\n00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.410\nchoose a style.\n\n50\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.735\nSo mine's a little bit smaller, but\n\n51\n00:02:45.735 --> 00:02:50.760\nyou do have the underlines here that will\nlet you know that the character panel,\n\n52\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.950\nlike quick release, I don't know,\n[LAUGH] all right, it's right there, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.090\nIt actually brings the panel for\nany options, and of course,\n\n54\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.580\nyou also have the paragraph.\n\n55\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.571\nI'm going to, for\nthis demonstration purposes and\n\n56\n00:03:02.571 --> 00:03:05.105\nto show you where you can find\nthe other ones in the Window menu, and\n\n57\n00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:08.290\nI just realized as soon as I clicked on\nthem, I'm like wait, it's all grayed out.\n\n58\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.420\nThe reason it's grayed out is\ncuz I have text selected, and\n\n59\n00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.890\nit doesn't like you to choose\npanels when you have it selected.\n\n60\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.550\n>> Interesting.\n\n61\n00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.920\n>> Yeah, I always thought that was,\nand I keep doing that.\n\n62\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.061\nSo I was like,\nI just did it again on camera.\n\n63\n00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.130\nAll right, so\nlet me click off of it first.\n\n64\n00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.840\nAnd let's go back to Windows, and now you\ncan see down at the bottom, we have Type.\n\n65\n00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.540\nAnd you have all of the different types\nof type panels that are available for\n\n66\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.700\nyou to have, that's a mouthful.\n\n67\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.150\nSo if I go to Character right there,\n\n68\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.050\nyou can see that it's going to\ngive me the choice for my font.\n\n69\n00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.820\nOr it's actually here, it's saying\nFont Family, and then the style.\n\n70\n00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.820\nBefore I forget, if your panel\ndoesn't look like mine, remember,\n\n71\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.390\nyou always have the options, so the Panel\nOptions button might have the hide option,\n\n72\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.640\nso if you don't see that, that's why.\n\n73\n00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.065\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and show that.\n\n74\n00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.604\nOkay, so let me go back to\nwhere I have my text selected.\n\n75\n00:03:55.604 --> 00:03:57.570\nAnd I can go here to my font, and\n\n76\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.750\nit'll give me all the different fonts\nthat I have installed on my machine here.\n\n77\n00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.030\nI'm gonna move this over a little bit,\nso you all can see that.\n\n78\n00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.080\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n79\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.780\nSo I've got my fonts, and\nit's gonna give me the samples\n\n80\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.500\nof the font right next to it, so\nI can see what it looks like.\n\n81\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.930\nAnd just really quickly here,\nthe TT versus the O,\n\n82\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.890\nwhat do you think that in the case there,\nMike?\n\n83\n00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.240\n>> I'm gonna say that's Open Type\nfonts versus True Type fonts.\n\n84\n00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.964\n>> Correct.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n85\n00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:27.731\nyou can know what type of font\nit's going to be, and whether or\n\n86\n00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:30.701\nnot you're going to have\nthe possible option for\n\n87\n00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:35.060\nthose extra characters that open type\nfonts will go ahead and show you.\n\n88\n00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.220\nSo here I can just pick,\nlike I have this one,\n\n89\n00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.750\nyou won't have this font on your\nmachine because I was doing a project,\n\n90\n00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.835\nwhere it needed to look like rock letters,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:47.835 --> 00:04:52.180\nSo I used this all age demo that\nI downloaded and what have you.\n\n92\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.850\nBut you can see some other ones here,\nArial.\n\n93\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.749\nBut like, what does that say?\n\n94\n00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:59.918\nLike Arial versus this,\nI mean like it says something.\n\n95\n00:04:59.918 --> 00:05:04.882\nLike what font you choose is the look,\nI don't think you'd probably want\n\n96\n00:05:04.882 --> 00:05:09.219\nyour Apple Chauncery for\na rock concert T-shirt [LAUGH] or logo.\n\n97\n00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.790\nIt just doesn't say it.\n\n98\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.671\nSo you can pick whatever font,\nand then of course,\n\n99\n00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:18.084\nyou have the font style available for you.\n\n100\n00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:21.777\nBut your font style depends\non what font family or\n\n101\n00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:25.110\nwhat font you're actually choosing.\n\n102\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.532\nSo, for example, we'll just go with Arial.\n\n103\n00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:32.376\nAnd by the way, I'm just coming\nup here and just typing it, so\n\n104\n00:05:32.376 --> 00:05:36.220\nit gives me like a kind of a quick jump\ndown into this long list of fonts I have.\n\n105\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.040\nWith Arial, I have regular,\nitalic, bold, and bold italic.\n\n106\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.652\nGreat, but do you see that that other,\nthat Apple Chauncery or that all ages,\n\n107\n00:05:43.652 --> 00:05:47.464\nit's not gonna have bold italic because\nit just doesn't exist within that font.\n\n108\n00:05:47.464 --> 00:05:54.270\nOkay, and some of them, I have a lot more,\nlike Minion Pro is one that I use a lot.\n\n109\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.090\nAnd if you look at that, it's like,\nthere's a whole bunch in here.\n\n110\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.370\nYou see that I have semi-bold, and\nbold, so you have different degrees.\n\n111\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.230\nAnd some of them have even more of them,\nso not-\n\n112\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.790\n>> So it's not the application that's\n\n113\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.120\ntaking that font and\nmaking it bold or making it italics.\n\n114\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.870\nIt's up to the font designer to include\na set of the letters that's in italics,\n\n115\n00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.630\na set of the letters that's bold.\n\n116\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.050\n>> Exactly, yeah, and\nnot all fonts the same.\n\n117\n00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.080\nAnd so that's why picking a font that\ngives you a lot of variations or\n\n118\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.000\nstyles is good for\nme as a designer because I can stay within\n\n119\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.320\nthe same font and\nhave a lot of different looks.\n\n120\n00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.740\nBut not go so extreme to where I have\nlike six different fonts on a brochure.\n\n121\n00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.890\nThat's just not really\na good design practice.\n\n122\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.450\nYou wanna try to keep within\ntwo to three fonts at the most.\n\n123\n00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.250\nI mean you do want contrast,\nlike your headings and\n\n124\n00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.360\nyour body text to look a little different,\nbut you don't wanna go so extreme,\n\n125\n00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.567\nwhere it's like a full on font party and\nit's not a good party.\n\n126\n00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:53.905\n[LAUGH] So\nthose are just things to think about.\n\n127\n00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:56.630\nSo that's how you can change what font\n\n128\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.828\nyou want to apply to whatever text you\nhave selected, font and font style.\n\n129\n00:07:01.828 --> 00:07:06.340\nOkay, so\n[COUGH] let's move on to some of the other\n\n130\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.180\ncharacter level formatting\nthat we have on this list.\n\n131\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.350\nAnd again, I'm gonna put this over here.\n\n132\n00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:17.630\nI have over here, another art board with\ncharacter formatting for you guys to see.\n\n133\n00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.160\nSo the next one, of course,\nis your font size.\n\n134\n00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.530\nWhat size do you want your text to be?\n\n135\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.074\nSo if you select it, right over here,\nthe two Ts, and if you hover over the icon\n\n136\n00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:33.376\nnext to the field, it will give you\nthe tool tip of what that field is doing.\n\n137\n00:07:33.376 --> 00:07:36.467\nOkay, so the two Ts right here\nis the text font size and\n\n138\n00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:39.120\nsome points, so I can make it bigger.\n\n139\n00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.760\nI can make it smaller,\nwhatever size I want.\n\n140\n00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.770\nI could actually type it in.\n\n141\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.820\nYou don't have to have\nit in whole numbers.\n\n142\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.791\nIt can do decimal points.\n\n143\n00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:52.515\nAnd that's something that if it's text and\nit's a text field, you can actually just\n\n144\n00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:58.280\ngrab this And drag it and make it bigger\nif it is created with type on a point.\n\n145\n00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.000\nAgain, once we get back to adding text,\nthere's two different ways.\n\n146\n00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.650\nThere's area type and point type,\nand that's the one you can do.\n\n147\n00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.040\nSo you can actually size it like you\nwould do any type of [INAUDIBLE].\n\n148\n00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.950\nI am holding shift by the way,\nso I can keep that proportioned.\n\n149\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.084\nAnd so you can see it's 18.96.\n\n150\n00:08:13.084 --> 00:08:16.430\nTo demonstrate it doesn't have\nto be in whole numbers, but\n\n151\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.160\nyou can choose the font size from here.\n\n152\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.940\nNow another one.\n\n153\n00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.330\nLetting.\n\n154\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.210\nLetting is the space\nbetween the baselines.\n\n155\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.800\nBaseline is where the text sits, remember?\n\n156\n00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.630\nSo you can see the lines of where\nthe text is sitting, that's the baseline.\n\n157\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:41.455\nIt's like line spacing in Word or\nwhatever, Word application.\n\n158\n00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:43.115\nWord processing,\nthat's what I'm thinking of.\n\n159\n00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:46.005\nSo the leading here is the space.\n\n160\n00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:47.675\nIt's the two A with a line on it.\n\n161\n00:08:47.675 --> 00:08:48.975\nRight there, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:48.975 --> 00:08:51.985\nAnd right now it's in parenthesis.\n\n163\n00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:54.155\nIt's in parenthesis that's auto leading.\n\n164\n00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:57.215\nAuto leading is always,\nwell not always, but\n\n165\n00:08:57.215 --> 00:09:01.285\nif you don't change the preferences it's\nalways a 120% of your font, font size.\n\n166\n00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:02.065\nOkay?\n\n167\n00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:08.640\nThat's what it means by\nleading size in parentheses.\n\n168\n00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.310\nSo if I bump this up,\nyou can see that it starts to increase\n\n169\n00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:18.090\nthe space between each line of text and\nit's great.\n\n170\n00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.200\nNow why would you want to add it for\nreadability?\n\n171\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.000\nFor stylistic purposes?\n\n172\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.641\nYou ever had a book where it\nwas almost like a hard read?\n\n173\n00:09:25.641 --> 00:09:26.581\n>> It was difficult to read,\n\n174\n00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:28.729\nbecause it just seems like a lot\nof work to actually read it.\n\n175\n00:09:28.729 --> 00:09:31.471\n>> Yeah, there's a whole like science or\n\n176\n00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.871\nart to like what your body text in\na book looks like on your eyes,\n\n177\n00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:39.800\nand how it's easier on your brain or\nhard on your brain.\n\n178\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.650\nYou probably seen it you’ve seen books\nAre spaced out a lot easier to read, and\n\n179\n00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.950\nyou use that serif font to\nhave your eye travel across,\n\n180\n00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.290\nso it's something to think about.\n\n181\n00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.360\nSo if I bump this down I make the letting\nreally smaller than the font size,\n\n182\n00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.290\nit just starts to really get squashed,\nand it’s harder to read, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.740\nYeah, that maybe, whoops, I'm hitting the\nwrong button, that's why it's not working.\n\n184\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.102\nSo, you can see increase [INAUDIBLE].\n\n185\n00:10:04.102 --> 00:10:06.940\nNow, letting is not the space\nbetween the paragraphs.\n\n186\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.640\nThat's a paragraph level formatting.\n\n187\n00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.860\nSo, I'll show you that in a second.\n\n188\n00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.150\nAll right, so\nlet's keep moving down our line.\n\n189\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.220\nKerning.\n\n190\n00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.210\nKerning and tracking.\n\n191\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.460\nKerning and tracking are similar,\nbut different.\n\n192\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.190\nThe same but different,\nlike my favorite saying.\n\n193\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.400\nKerning is a space between two characters,\njust two characters.\n\n194\n00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.600\nNot the overall spacing across all\nof the letters within A sentence or\n\n195\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.170\na paragraph or\nwhere you're going is two letters.\n\n196\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:39.410\nSo Kerning, you can see it here,\nthe space between the i and\n\n197\n00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:44.990\nthe a, or the a and the i and\nthe i and the t, versus the W and a.\n\n198\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.650\nSo you'll see that a lot with W's or\nany letters that have\n\n199\n00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:54.920\na wider space, but you know the next\nletters are a little bit too far off,\n\n200\n00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:00.070\nso the larger the text gets that's when\nwanna probably start doing kerning.\n\n201\n00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.300\nAgain this is all because of how\nyou want the letters to look,\n\n202\n00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.410\nit's this is not like you have to put\nkerning on everything you do like\n\n203\n00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.950\neverywhere that says waiting It's\njust if you want it to look that way.\n\n204\n00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.570\nSo I'm just gonna double-click\nto get the flashing\n\n205\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.520\ncursor in between the W and the A.\n\n206\n00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.200\nAnd I'm going to come right here, and\nI'm just gonna start either bumping it up.\n\n207\n00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.120\nI'm gonna go a little bit more,\nso let's go there.\n\n208\n00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.890\nSo that's a big demonstration\nthere of more kerning\n\n209\n00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.790\nis going to give you more space\nbetween those two letters.\n\n210\n00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.910\nLess kerning is going to,\nwell, make it closer.\n\n211\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.560\nSo maybe I wanted it to be even closer.\n\n212\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.130\nThere you go.\nSo,\n\n213\n00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:44.000\nthat way the space doesn't look as off as,\naccording to the rest of the letters.\n\n214\n00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.770\n>> I've seen that when I've made a header,\nand made a very large font.\n\n215\n00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:47.430\nAs you were saying,\n\n216\n00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.345\nit almost seems like one of the letters\nis not part of the rest of the word.\n\n217\n00:11:50.345 --> 00:11:51.830\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> because there's a little more space\n\n218\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.710\nbetween the rest of them.\n\n219\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.660\nSo this way, kerning allows\nme to adjust that space, but\n\n220\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.270\nthen not change the space between all\nof the other letters in that same word.\n\n221\n00:11:59.270 --> 00:11:59.850\n>> Exactly.\n\n222\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:00.470\n>> Very cool.\n>> Yes.\n\n223\n00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.430\nAnd I was gonna bring up some notes,\nbecause there was something I didn't know\n\n224\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:10.370\nif you noticed it when I started, the\nvalue wasn't 0, it was already a negative.\n\n225\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.390\nHere you can see that between the A and\nthe I it's in 0,\n\n226\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.260\nand there's that parentheses thing.\n\n227\n00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260\nThat's that auto thing going on again.\n\n228\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.370\nSo I just wanted to,\nwhoops, wrong keyboard.\n\n229\n00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.450\nTo talk about there's optical kerning,\nand then there is auto-kerning, and\n\n230\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.640\nthen there's metrics kerning.\n\n231\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.200\n>> Mm.\n>> So\n\n232\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.280\nthese are things that, auto is on by\ndefault, it's just gonna do it for you.\n\n233\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.490\nIt's kind of the judge what it is.\n\n234\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.170\nSo, what is it to be optics or\nversus metrics.\n\n235\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.148\nAnd so, and I always confuse this, so\nthat's why I wanted to get my notes.\n\n236\n00:12:39.148 --> 00:12:40.570\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.340\n>> So the optical kerning,\n\n238\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.110\nit's built into a font.\n\n239\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:50.250\nOkay so it's based on whatever\nthe font says the kerning should be.\n\n240\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.350\nAnd so Illustrator's is going\nto just let it do it for you.\n\n241\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:59.610\nThat's like optical kerning is\ngoing by what the font says.\n\n242\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.729\nThe auto kerning, which is also\nknown as just straight up metric\n\n243\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.980\nIs built into the kerning table,\nthe font, and that assigns that.\n\n244\n00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:13.380\nIt's almost the same, but\nit's kind of different, and it says\n\n245\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.807\noptical kerning is a good choice for\nfonts with inadequate build in kerning.\n\n246\n00:13:17.807 --> 00:13:22.070\nWe're getting a little too\ndeep into definitions.\n\n247\n00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.760\nReally, honestly,\nyou just pick whichever one looks good.\n\n248\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.260\n>> Right.\n>> Okay?\n\n249\n00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.650\nWhichever one you like better.\n\n250\n00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.440\nIf I did optical kerning,\n\n251\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.470\nyou can see here optical versus my auto,\n\n252\n00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:38.460\nit's just deciding which way\nit wants to space the letters.\n\n253\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.290\nOK, so the metrics only.\n\n254\n00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:46.620\nThat's something where it's really\nonly used for Japanese typography.\n\n255\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.060\nYou don't use it like really\nin any Roman type characters.\n\n256\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.320\nAnyways, that's what you've got going on\nto where it will judge it on your own.\n\n257\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.800\nJudge it on it's own or you tell it\nspace you want between the letters.\n\n258\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.950\nAll right, so\nyou're waiting now for tracking.\n\n259\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.960\nSo with tracking, that's again,\nthe space across all the letters and\n\n260\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.660\nit gives it equally, so\nif I start bumping up this tracking.\n\n261\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.120\nThat's down, wrong button.\n\n262\n00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.760\nSo there you go, maybe I'll go a little\nbit faster, so you can see that, there.\n\n263\n00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.312\nSo all the letters are spaced out more,\neven more.\n\n264\n00:14:22.312 --> 00:14:26.190\nKind of gives it a different\nlook to the text.\n\n265\n00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.085\nSo tracking across all of them.\n\n266\n00:14:28.085 --> 00:14:28.585\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n267\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.120\nOkay?\nThere are a few other little\n\n268\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.150\nguy going on here.\n\n269\n00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.091\nBaseline shift, well if we know what\nthe baseline is where the text sits,\n\n270\n00:14:36.091 --> 00:14:39.730\nthen a baseline shift is well that\nit's shifting either up or down.\n\n271\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.477\nSo if I take,\nlet's say just this one word, and\n\n272\n00:14:44.477 --> 00:14:47.811\nI do a positive baseline shifts.\n\n273\n00:14:47.811 --> 00:14:49.850\nThat means it's going up, okay?\n\n274\n00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.750\nIt's almost like superscript.\n\n275\n00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.190\nWhoops, oops, sorry.\n\n276\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.790\nWhoops, I'm trying to\nuse too many shortcuts.\n\n277\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.790\nAnd I'm actually deleting my text.\n\n278\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.400\nFor some reason my space bar for\nmy hand tool.\n\n279\n00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.320\nAnd of course, I think you can get\nthe idea here is if you do a negative\n\n280\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.400\nthen it goes below, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.450\nSo that's your baseline shift.\n\n282\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.810\nScale, I think you all can\nprobably understand what that is.\n\n283\n00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.740\nIt's vertical scale\nversus horizontal scale.\n\n284\n00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.980\nIf I horizontal, or vertically scale it,\nit's going to stretch the letters out.\n\n285\n00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.210\nOr if I do a horizontal scale then it is\ngoing to stretch the letters horizontally,\n\n286\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.960\nso it's just stretching or scaling.\n\n287\n00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.970\nThen a few other little guys down here.\n\n288\n00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.000\nYou have the rows down here\non the character panel,\n\n289\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.870\nthat is where you have your all caps,\n\n290\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.870\nyour small caps, superscript, subscript,\nunderlines and strikethrough.\n\n291\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.310\nThat was the one thing people always ask.\n\n292\n00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.010\nI can't underline things in illustrator.\n\n293\n00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.470\nWell you can, it's not in a place.\n\n294\n00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.080\nIt's not like with U that\nyou normally looking for.\n\n295\n00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.315\n>> All right.\n>> In the word processing program.\n\n296\n00:15:52.315 --> 00:15:53.290\nSo it's there.\n\n297\n00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.253\nYou just got to find it.\n\n298\n00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:56.691\nSo I take this and\nstart clicking on this buttons.\n\n299\n00:15:56.691 --> 00:16:02.771\nYou can see the idea Of the, well actually\nI'd have to select that one guy and\n\n300\n00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:06.970\ngo to a subscript, and\nthat would be a superscript.\n\n301\n00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.940\nAnd then I could take this,\ndo a strike through,\n\n302\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.060\nor underline and move on my merry way.\n\n303\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.790\nSo that's what you got going on\nwith your character panel and\n\n304\n00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.260\nall sorts of character\nformats that you can do.\n\n305\n00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.200\n>> Very good.\n\n306\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.270\n>> Okay so now we're going on\nto paragraph level formatting.\n\n307\n00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.200\nSo this is again where we've\nhit our enter on our keyboard.\n\n308\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.760\nAnd we've made a new paragraph and\nthat's how our paragraphs look.\n\n309\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.210\nSo let's jump into that.\n\n310\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.360\nWe've got a few things over here.\n\n311\n00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.341\nIf we did the character formatting with\nour character panel then I think we're\n\n312\n00:16:38.341 --> 00:16:41.488\ngonna do our paragraph formatting\nwith our paragraph panel.\n\n313\n00:16:41.488 --> 00:16:45.410\nOkay, again, if you need to you can\nshow options if you don't have them.\n\n314\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.994\nSo there's a few other things and\n\n315\n00:16:47.994 --> 00:16:53.990\nthese options are very important to me\nbecause I am a big fan of space before and\n\n316\n00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.973\nspace after a paragraph so\nit's a big thing for me.\n\n317\n00:16:57.973 --> 00:17:01.133\n[LAUGH] Its kind of a pet peeve almost.\n\n318\n00:17:01.133 --> 00:17:02.790\nAnyways, let me keep going.\n\n319\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.613\nSo here we go.\n\n320\n00:17:03.613 --> 00:17:07.950\nI've got my paragraphs, and\nhow do I know that these are paragraphs?\n\n321\n00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:09.420\nRemember our hidden characters?\n\n322\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.260\nIf I go to my type menu and\n\n323\n00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.580\nI go to show hidden characters\nyou can see that right there.\n\n324\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:15.650\nWhoops there we go.\n\n325\n00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.010\nThere's my paragraph.\n\n326\n00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.340\nThere's my paragraph.\n\n327\n00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.810\nSo I know that these are paragraphs.\n\n328\n00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.310\nThey're not just line breaks.\n\n329\n00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.950\nOkay?\nSo I've got the whole text area selected.\n\n330\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.389\nLeft align, right align,\ncenter align, justified.\n\n331\n00:17:30.389 --> 00:17:33.893\nAgain, those buttons that you\nusually see in any word processing,\n\n332\n00:17:33.893 --> 00:17:35.750\nyou have the same thing here.\n\n333\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.350\nAlso they sometimes\ncall it left justified,\n\n334\n00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.060\nthey can also refer to\nit as justification.\n\n335\n00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.390\nA lot of people just refer to it\nas left aligned and right aligned.\n\n336\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.560\nSo left,\neverything's along that left edge versus\n\n337\n00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.720\nyour right aligned where everything\nis right aligned in your paragraphs.\n\n338\n00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.720\nYou also have centered, so\nyou have centered text.\n\n339\n00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.160\nAnd then you have justified text.\n\n340\n00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.680\nJustified, and that's where,\nthey call it left justified,\n\n341\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.180\nand they actually call it full\njustification, okay, or fully justified.\n\n342\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.080\nAnd then you also have how\nit treats the last line.\n\n343\n00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.840\nFull justification, or justify all lines\nyou can see that it actually takes and\n\n344\n00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.200\nmakes the edges of the text frame.\n\n345\n00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.140\nThey're not really margins but sometimes\nin other applications you call it margins,\n\n346\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.470\nwhere it spaces everything\nout according to those edges.\n\n347\n00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.360\nAnd that's where it sits.\n\n348\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.940\nThat last line, it can get really weird\nif you only have a couple of words.\n\n349\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:41.310\nThat's not necessarily always the best\nchoice for lines that aren't equal.\n\n350\n00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.030\nOkay, so\nI'm not saying you shouldn't never use it.\n\n351\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.100\nYou see this a lot.\n\n352\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.340\nHave you ever seen this in newspapers?\n\n353\n00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.270\n>> I was gonna say a newspaper is\ntypically things where I've got multiple\n\n354\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.950\ncolumns side by side.\n\n355\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.070\nIf you got one edge that's jagged it\njust doesn't have that neat appearance.\n\n356\n00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.150\nBut when you justify it, you've got\nthose nice, neat edges on each one of\n\n357\n00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.610\nthe columns and it seems to make\nit a little bit easier to read.\n\n358\n00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.440\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n359\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.710\nIt's very prevalent in newspapers,\nyou'll see it all over the place.\n\n360\n00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.490\nAnd that line you were talking about,\nthey actually refer to that as a rag.\n\n361\n00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.720\nA right rag.\n\n362\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.600\nIf it's a left justified, or\nleft aligned text, the right side,\n\n363\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.960\nyou see how it kinda goes in and\nout and in and out?\n\n364\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.540\nThat's what they call a right rag,\nand so you can control\n\n365\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:27.200\nyour rag if you can control\nyour hyphenation sometimes.\n\n366\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.550\nSo that actually, I kinda jumped\nthe gun just a little bit but\n\n367\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.160\nhyphenation is a paragraph\nlevel formatting.\n\n368\n00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.660\nLike where does it, like you can see\nright here that it's actually saying,\n\n369\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.470\nit's breaking that word and\ngiving that hyphenation.\n\n370\n00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.820\nNow, it will help your\nright rag in some cases but\n\n371\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.370\nyou can also can get too many hyphens.\n\n372\n00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:53.420\nIf you've got like 6 hyphens in a row\nthen that doesn't really look very good.\n\n373\n00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.900\nAnd that can be really distracting.\n\n374\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.810\nSo hyphenation, and\nwhether you're hyphenating or not,\n\n375\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:05.020\nis a check box at the bottom\nof your paragraph panel.\n\n376\n00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.150\nSo if I uncheck it, you can see well,\nit's stopped hyphenating.\n\n377\n00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.760\nAnd now if I do it, it hyphenates.\n\n378\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.556\nBut you could also,\nif you get too many hyphens, or\n\n379\n00:20:12.556 --> 00:20:16.760\nyou don't want it hyphenating\nthe last line, or capitalized words.\n\n380\n00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:22.510\nYou can change the hyphenation\nsettings in the panel options.\n\n381\n00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.250\nSo if I go to my panel options\nbutton on my paragraph panel,\n\n382\n00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:31.350\nyou can go into hyphenation, and then you\ncan control where the hyphenation starts.\n\n383\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.190\nSo you could see better spacing,\nfewer hyphens.\n\n384\n00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.490\nAll the different options like if\n\n385\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.750\nyou don't want it hyphenating\nafter just the first few letters,\n\n386\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:45.310\nyou can bump that up and you can change\nthe settings of your hyphenations.\n\n387\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.800\nWhich is really handy,\n\n388\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.540\nespecially if you're doing a lot of type\nsetting, you might wanna control that,\n\n389\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.830\nso I wanted to throw that in there\nwith your hyphenation settings.\n\n390\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.900\nAll right.\n\n391\n00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.550\nSo what else do we have going on for\nparagraph level four range?\n\n392\n00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.930\nYou have indents.\n\n393\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.100\nIndenting, this is bringing me back\nto remember writing term papers?\n\n394\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:06.710\n>> Yes.\n\n395\n00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.140\n>> Yes and APA and all the different\nstyles that you had to have,\n\n396\n00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.320\nand if you're citing something of\nmore than four lines and indent.\n\n397\n00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.125\nAnd back in the day when, well we didn't\nhave things handy like Word and Illus-\n\n398\n00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:20.253\n>> [LAUGH] We had typewriters.\n\n399\n00:21:20.253 --> 00:21:22.890\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah we did, so\n\n400\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:27.080\nit was very difficult writing those\npapers at 3am in the morning.\n\n401\n00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.170\nSo with indents,\nyou're just indenting a paragraph.\n\n402\n00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.860\nNow I'm gonna select just one paragraph so\nyou can see it.\n\n403\n00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.560\nAnd just so I can show you as well, that\nif your doing paragraph level formatting,\n\n404\n00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.700\nyou don't have to have\nthe whole paragraph selected.\n\n405\n00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.710\nCuz you're saying I want the paragraph\nformatting to be that way.\n\n406\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.880\nSo, little trick.\n\n407\n00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.520\nBut, this is my left indent,\nthis is going to be my right indent.\n\n408\n00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.540\nSo, you can see, if I go ahead and bump\nthat left indent up and I bump that right.\n\n409\n00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.530\nLet me just go ahead and\ntype it in so you can see it.\n\n410\n00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.320\nIt's gonna go ahead and start squishing,\n\n411\n00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.980\nif you want to say, the sides of\nthat paragraph from the margins or\n\n412\n00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:07.018\nthe text frame area or options that\nare text frame edges that we have here.\n\n413\n00:22:07.018 --> 00:22:10.550\nSo awesome indenting.\n\n414\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.820\nYou also have the first line indent.\n\n415\n00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.870\nRemember the rule?\n\n416\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.620\nWhat was it?\n\n417\n00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.420\n>> Yes,\nI don't remember the actual rule, but\n\n418\n00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.870\nyou always started that first line in\nyour paragraph was always indented.\n\n419\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:25.600\n>> 5 spaces.\n\n420\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.080\n>> 5 spaces or one tab.\n\n421\n00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.990\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n422\n00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.430\nYou know that's, I looked that up, and\nI'm like, cuz that's how I was taught.\n\n423\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.610\n>> And people were like,\nI was never taught that.\n\n424\n00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.800\nI think it's really just\na stylistic preference.\n\n425\n00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.450\n>> Hm.\n>> But I had seen that.\n\n426\n00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.090\nWhere people were like.\n\n427\n00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:42.020\n>> Right.\n>> No, we don't do that.\n\n428\n00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.150\nYou always left justify, and I ask people,\nit's like, it's really your choice.\n\n429\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.130\nIt's like you do one,\nyou do it consistently.\n\n430\n00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:48.650\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n431\n00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.770\nit seems to be too how you've done the\nrest of your paragraph formatting because\n\n432\n00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.540\nif you haven't done like your big thing\nis space before or space after so\n\n433\n00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.350\nyour paragraph is really set off.\n\n434\n00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.980\nBut if you don't have a lot of space\nbefore or space after, that indentation of\n\n435\n00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.699\nthe first line is a good indicator\nof where the next paragraph starts.\n\n436\n00:23:03.699 --> 00:23:05.615\nMakes it a bit easier to find paragraphs.\n\n437\n00:23:05.615 --> 00:23:08.700\n>> Yeah and this is also starting to\ncome back to me a little bit more.\n\n438\n00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.390\nWith the rise of computers and\nthis proportional fonts and\n\n439\n00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:16.470\neverything, it's a lot easier to see\nwhere you're paragraphs start and stop as\n\n440\n00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:20.300\nopposed to on a typewriter, it was all the\nsame spacing and you couldn't adjust it.\n\n441\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.880\nYou didn't know where things were changing\nlike the space after and space before and\n\n442\n00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.450\neverything like that.\n\n443\n00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:29.300\nSo and with screen,\nwe're talking about type on paper.\n\n444\n00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.050\nWe didn't have screens that\nwe were reading on and so\n\n445\n00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.880\nit's actually the screen\nversion of everything.\n\n446\n00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.540\nThe first line is not indented.\n\n447\n00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.920\nSo it's kind of fallen out of favor.\n\n448\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.075\nBut again, to each his own.\n\n449\n00:23:42.075 --> 00:23:45.840\n[LAUGH] We know what it is,\nand we know how to do it.\n\n450\n00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.700\nSo, first line, okay, now, yes,\nspace after and space before.\n\n451\n00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.250\nMy favorite.\n\n452\n00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:58.600\nLike right here, it is a little difficult\nto see when my paragraphs start and stop.\n\n453\n00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.322\nNow, this is where,\nlet me tell you how to do it and\n\n454\n00:24:00.322 --> 00:24:01.677\nthen I'll tell you about my pet peeve.\n\n455\n00:24:01.677 --> 00:24:06.641\nOkay, so, I'm going to select all of\nthis just to show you a different way to\n\n456\n00:24:06.641 --> 00:24:08.513\ndo it I prefer a space after.\n\n457\n00:24:08.513 --> 00:24:09.535\nYes, you can do it before.\n\n458\n00:24:09.535 --> 00:24:12.724\nBut, to me, if you're going down and\nyou're reading,\n\n459\n00:24:12.724 --> 00:24:15.350\nthe space comes after, after, after.\n\n460\n00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.090\nMaybe it's just me and my brain.\n\n461\n00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.260\n>> You could do both if you really want.\n\n462\n00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.290\n>> You could.\n\n463\n00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.110\nBut I always like to just do one, because\nthen I can't, why doesn't it change?\n\n464\n00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.165\nIt's two settings.\n\n465\n00:24:24.165 --> 00:24:27.120\nInstead of one, so\nagain, personal opinion.\n\n466\n00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.860\nIf I start bumping, whoops, the wrong way,\nif I start bumping this up,\n\n467\n00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.850\nyou can see, that's better.\n\n468\n00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:37.730\nNow, I can see where each one of my\nparagraphs start and stop, which again,\n\n469\n00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:43.010\ndifferent than line spacing or\nour leading, right, just to demonstrate.\n\n470\n00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.710\nI could go ahead and\nincrease the line spacing.\n\n471\n00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:50.610\nBut then the paragraph\nspacing is different.\n\n472\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.463\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay,\n\n473\n00:24:51.463 --> 00:24:56.690\ntwo separate things that can look the same\nif you didn't know what they were doing.\n\n474\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.320\n>> I've seen some of you talk about\nthe top versus the bottom and\n\n475\n00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.450\nwhich one do you prefer.\n\n476\n00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.900\nLike I've seen some situations\nwhere I've got an image.\n\n477\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.860\nAnd then a paragraph that follows it.\n\n478\n00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.760\nAnd I need a little space between\nthe image and that paragraph,\n\n479\n00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.380\nor the description for the image.\n\n480\n00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.260\nSo we'll do a little top spacing there.\n\n481\n00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.825\n>> That's a very good example.\n\n482\n00:25:13.825 --> 00:25:14.870\n[LAUGH] Good.\n\n483\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.370\nSo that would be before.\n\n484\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.480\n>> Before the paragraph, yes.\n\n485\n00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.310\nBecause you've got the description of\nthe image that's right underneath it but\n\n486\n00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.705\nit would look like the top of\nthe letters bump into the image.\n\n487\n00:25:22.705 --> 00:25:23.887\n>> Yeah.\n\n488\n00:25:23.887 --> 00:25:24.435\nGood example.\n\n489\n00:25:24.435 --> 00:25:26.142\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n490\n00:25:26.142 --> 00:25:27.820\n>> That's an excellent example.\n\n491\n00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.980\nAll right yes.\n\n492\n00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.271\nSo yes it's very good to\nknow what space after now.\n\n493\n00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:37.323\nThis is what a lot of people do.\n\n494\n00:25:37.323 --> 00:25:39.738\nAnd I've been just as guilty of it.\n\n495\n00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:40.501\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n496\n00:25:40.501 --> 00:25:43.430\nif I want space you just\ndo your enters right.\n\n497\n00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:44.960\n>> For the blank paragraph there.\n\n498\n00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.976\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n499\n00:25:45.976 --> 00:25:47.020\nYou've done it.\n\n500\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:47.850\n>> Yeah.\n>> I've done it.\n\n501\n00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.560\n>> Absolutely.\n\n502\n00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.480\n>> Well, [LAUGH] it wasn't until I got\ninto, really into type setting and\n\n503\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:59.680\ndoing textbook layouts and extensive\ntext formatting, which drives me crazy.\n\n504\n00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.011\nBecause if I get somebody that's typed\na whole manuscript or anything like that,\n\n505\n00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:06.724\nand I'm trying to then put\nit into an application.\n\n506\n00:26:06.724 --> 00:26:09.651\nCuz they usually give me, in a Word or\nwhatever type of text file or\n\n507\n00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.420\napplication they're using.\n\n508\n00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.670\nAnd then I have to put it into InDesign or\nIllustrator, well,\n\n509\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.811\nif I'm doing extensive it\nwould be definitely InDesign.\n\n510\n00:26:15.811 --> 00:26:18.530\nI put it in,\nI've got all those extra paragraphs.\n\n511\n00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.030\nI can't control my space after paragraphs,\n\n512\n00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.190\ncuz there's extra paragraphs\nin between each one of them.\n\n513\n00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.740\nAnd it is It drives me insane.\n\n514\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.550\n>> It's like what we were about\nthe other day, using spaces to\n\n515\n00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.850\nget something to be centered on the page\nit's hard to work with after that fact.\n\n516\n00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.650\n>> Yeah, I can't do have tab\nstops if I don't have tabs.\n\n517\n00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:39.840\n>> I can't do what I want to do to format\nthe text with space after paragraphs\n\n518\n00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.420\nbecause I've double paragraphs.\n\n519\n00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.090\nIt's again a pet peeve.\n\n520\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.250\nBut there's actually a really handy trick\nthat you can do to get rid of them all.\n\n521\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.050\nIt's in design.\n\n522\n00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.520\nHonestly, it's been a while since\nI've used it, so if you search for\n\n523\n00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.885\nit online you can find it's a little\nbit more advanced which you run this\n\n524\n00:26:56.885 --> 00:26:59.464\nlike macro thing and\nit's like poof it gets rid of it and\n\n525\n00:26:59.464 --> 00:27:03.705\nI was just like it's the best thing ever\nfor my little nerdy, you know, font brain.\n\n526\n00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:06.512\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But it's really fantastic, so,\n\n527\n00:27:06.512 --> 00:27:09.299\nI don't wanna manually do it,\nI wanna get rid of them.\n\n528\n00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:10.718\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can either do it in Word,\n\n529\n00:27:10.718 --> 00:27:12.366\nbut there is one in InDesign you can do,\ntoo.\n\n530\n00:27:12.366 --> 00:27:14.049\n>> Nice.\n>> So, all right,\n\n531\n00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:17.300\nlet's just quickly go over some styles.\n\n532\n00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.020\nSo, what is a style?\n\n533\n00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.800\nA style is a collection of\nformats you can apply quickly.\n\n534\n00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.090\nThey're awesome, I love styles.\n\n535\n00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.435\nDoing that textbook formatting.\n\n536\n00:27:28.435 --> 00:27:28.960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n537\n00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.680\n>> Got to have a styles, I think I gave\nthat example in the typography lesson.\n\n538\n00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.710\nThey are a little wonky in Illustrator,\nthey don't work nearly as nice,\n\n539\n00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.660\nif you want to say,\nas they do in InDesign.\n\n540\n00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.660\nInDesign styles amazing.\n\n541\n00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.850\nIllustrator, they work but\n\n542\n00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:50.070\nyou just got to kind of make sure\nyou don't go too crazy with them.\n\n543\n00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.622\nSo, I'll give you some examples.\n\n544\n00:27:52.622 --> 00:27:56.900\n>> Now does a style include both\ncharacter and paragraph formatting or\n\n545\n00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.400\nis it a different style for\ncharacter versus paragraph?\n\n546\n00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.090\n>> That's an excellent question and\nthey're separate.\n\n547\n00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:08.750\nYour character styles will only\nhold character level formatting and\n\n548\n00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.620\nyou apply it to individual words.\n\n549\n00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:18.790\nYour paragraph styles will hold if\nyou want to say your paragraph level\n\n550\n00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.930\nformatting, and your character formatting,\nyou can kinda combine them all into one.\n\n551\n00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.200\nI want to have Arial font,\n\n552\n00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.510\nit's going to be ten points,\nit's gonna be a 14 point leading,\n\n553\n00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:32.745\nit's going to have six point space after,\nit's not going to be hyphenated.\n\n554\n00:28:32.745 --> 00:28:35.795\nRight that was some character formatting\nand some paragraph formatting.\n\n555\n00:28:35.795 --> 00:28:39.785\nI make that all into a paragraph style and\nit applies to everything.\n\n556\n00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:44.125\nBut a character form may only want\ncertain words like the word Florida to\n\n557\n00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:47.750\nalways be bold and green.\n\n558\n00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:54.850\nThat would be a character style that then\nI would apply to those specific words.\n\n559\n00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:59.430\nSo, in character format,\ncharacter styles always override\n\n560\n00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.290\nparagraph cuz it's closer\nto whatever's closest wins.\n\n561\n00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:07.970\nThat's how I explain character\nstyles versus paragraph styles.\n\n562\n00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.840\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna do is within illustrator so\n\n563\n00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.250\nI'm gonna just show you really quickly.\n\n564\n00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:16.490\nI've got my window and I've got my\ntype and I've got my character and\n\n565\n00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:21.250\nparagraph styles panel, went way over\nhere, so let's put that guy over there,\n\n566\n00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.550\nlet's not dock that in.\n\n567\n00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:28.040\nAll right so I want to be able\nto make like a heading style and\n\n568\n00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.340\nlike a body text style.\n\n569\n00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.970\nSo you go ahead and select your type,\nthere's a couple of ways to do this.\n\n570\n00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.170\nLet me show you two ways.\n\n571\n00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.600\nYou select the text.\n\n572\n00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.620\nYou go ahead and do whatever you wanna do.\n\n573\n00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.370\nI'm gonna go ahead and make this Arial and\n\n574\n00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:45.010\nI'm gonna make it ten points, and\nI'm gonna make it 14 point letting and\n\n575\n00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.280\nI'm going to have some space\nafter paragraph, like I said.\n\n576\n00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.520\nAnd I'm going to not have it hyphenated.\n\n577\n00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.920\nSo there's my formatting that I want to be\nable to then apply to other paragraphs,\n\n578\n00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.900\nso I have the text still selected.\n\n579\n00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.090\nI can come over here to my Paragraphs\nStyles Panel, go to New Paragraph Style,\n\n580\n00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.310\nbecause this is the way I usually do it,\nin design, and\n\n581\n00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.980\nI'll just go with Body text.\n\n582\n00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.901\nOkay?\n\n583\n00:30:07.901 --> 00:30:09.940\nI don't really want to add\nit to my library right now.\n\n584\n00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.922\nI'm previewing it.\n\n585\n00:30:10.922 --> 00:30:13.508\nAnd I can go through and change,\nyou know I've got all my settings, but\n\n586\n00:30:13.508 --> 00:30:14.989\nI've already done this so I click okay.\n\n587\n00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:17.985\nNow the thing if you do it this way,\nyou've made it.\n\n588\n00:30:17.985 --> 00:30:20.745\nBut look over here in\nthe paragraph styles panel,\n\n589\n00:30:20.745 --> 00:30:25.995\nits not actually applying\nthe one that you did.\n\n590\n00:30:25.995 --> 00:30:31.390\nIt's saying nope, no I didn't get it so\nyou have to then click this.\n\n591\n00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:36.690\nAnd then there's another thing that\nhappens is you see there's that little\n\n592\n00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.670\nplus sign on the end of a paragraph.\n\n593\n00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:44.240\nIt's like all right, well you've applied\nthe paragraph style to the selected text,\n\n594\n00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.248\nbut the problem is I'm\nholding onto something.\n\n595\n00:30:47.248 --> 00:30:51.282\nOkay, that plus sign means\nthat you have style overrides,\n\n596\n00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:53.790\nremember that closest always wins?\n\n597\n00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:57.950\nThere's something that's closest to that\ntext that's not allowing you to have\n\n598\n00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.400\nthe full.\n\n599\n00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.720\n>> It's not applying all of\nthe settings within that style.\n\n600\n00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.620\n>> Correct, yes, and\nnow this is a weird example, because well,\n\n601\n00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.870\nthat's what you wanted.\n\n602\n00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:08.620\nYes, there's a style\noverride that you can do.\n\n603\n00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.620\nThere's a quick keystroke.\n\n604\n00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.780\nIf you hold your Alt key or\nyour Option key and then click the style.\n\n605\n00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.630\nIt actually then removes the overrides.\n\n606\n00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.740\nIt's saying I don't have anything else\nthat's not letting me do this style, okay.\n\n607\n00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.700\nSo, just kind of a little\nthing to always watch.\n\n608\n00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:31.620\nAnd that's where, again,\nillustrator is just a little weird\n\n609\n00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.290\nwhen it comes to style, so\nthere's always override, it seems like.\n\n610\n00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.110\nSo, it's not as seamless\nas it is in design.\n\n611\n00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.100\nBut if you just understand\nwhat the plus sign means.\n\n612\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.364\nAnd you don't wanna have that, and how to\nget rid of it by doing that Alt option\n\n613\n00:31:45.364 --> 00:31:48.063\nclick of the style,\nthen you're gonna be okay.\n\n614\n00:31:48.063 --> 00:31:52.933\nSo now if, now that I've made that style,\njust to show you really quickly if I go\n\n615\n00:31:52.933 --> 00:31:57.459\nhere, and then I go to there,\nsee it's actually applied the same style.\n\n616\n00:31:57.459 --> 00:32:00.195\nAnd so I can come over here Sorry, and\n\n617\n00:32:00.195 --> 00:32:04.257\nthen say alright well now,\nI've got this right here,\n\n618\n00:32:04.257 --> 00:32:09.148\nI'm gonna have the whole text-file or\nthis whole text-frame.\n\n619\n00:32:09.148 --> 00:32:12.519\nAnd I'm going to, and\nI still got that plus sign there, see, so\n\n620\n00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:14.525\nif alt click, it's gonna remove it.\n\n621\n00:32:14.525 --> 00:32:19.420\nAnd so everything is quickly formatted\nto that way that I wanted it to be.\n\n622\n00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.660\n>> Big time saver.\n\n623\n00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.320\n>> Yeah, very big, and\nthen, the other way and\n\n624\n00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.255\nI'll do it with a character style\njust to show you the difference.\n\n625\n00:32:27.255 --> 00:32:32.306\nIs instead of like selecting and\nthen doing the formatting first,\n\n626\n00:32:32.306 --> 00:32:37.082\nwhat you can do is if you make\nthe style first you can avoid some of\n\n627\n00:32:37.082 --> 00:32:41.060\nthose weird overrides and\nthings like that.\n\n628\n00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.680\nIf I make a new character style, and\nI just go just red for really quickly.\n\n629\n00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.430\nI can come over here through\nthe character style dialogue box,\n\n630\n00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.480\nand I can change things like what\nare my basic character formats.\n\n631\n00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.452\nAnd what is my character color,\nso I'll go with red.\n\n632\n00:32:57.452 --> 00:33:01.120\nAnd maybe I'll just do it red,\nso we can see it right there.\n\n633\n00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.930\nSo if I say, all right,\nI've made a style called red.\n\n634\n00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:07.680\nAnd so\nthat way when I come into some text,\n\n635\n00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:12.460\nlike if I wanted that to be red,\nI just click it and then it makes it red.\n\n636\n00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.690\nSo, you do have a little, I think,\n\n637\n00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:20.070\neasier time if you make the style\nfirst and then apply it.\n\n638\n00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.234\nIt's just, I don't know, it's just I've\nfound in Illustrator that's the easier way\n\n639\n00:33:24.234 --> 00:33:26.520\nto go,\nit's like the path of least resistance.\n\n640\n00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.000\n>> It can be a little bit\ncounterintuitive, though.\n\n641\n00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.480\nIf you know exactly what you want, you can\nmake it ahead of time and then apply it.\n\n642\n00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.380\nBut if you're kinda formatting as you\ngo and kinda developing the style,\n\n643\n00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.560\nwhat looks best.\n\n644\n00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.930\nShould I do it this way,\nshould I do that, I really like that and\n\n645\n00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.360\nthen turn it into a style.\n\n646\n00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.650\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now you've got the override issues.\n\n647\n00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.700\n>> Yeah, exactly, so\nyou can get to the same place,\n\n648\n00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.950\njust where you're gonna start with it,\nwhich is fantastic.\n\n649\n00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:51.500\nAnd then one last thing to really\ndemonstrate why I'm doing styles.\n\n650\n00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.970\nBecause I have a style,\nI've applied it to some things.\n\n651\n00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.370\nBut now I come back later and\nI realize, you know what,\n\n652\n00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:01.200\nI don't like that color red, and I've\napplied it in a whole bunch of places.\n\n653\n00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.400\nOr maybe that body text style that I made,\nI want it to have more letting, right?\n\n654\n00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.000\nIt's connected to a style,\nyou change the style,\n\n655\n00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.040\nit changes everywhere,\nthat's the fantastic part about it.\n\n656\n00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.825\nSo I don't have anything selected,\n\n657\n00:34:13.825 --> 00:34:16.192\nI'm gonna come over here\nto my character style.\n\n658\n00:34:16.192 --> 00:34:19.256\nAnd I'm gonna double click, not on\nthe words, because if you double click on\n\n659\n00:34:19.256 --> 00:34:21.775\nthe words it wants to rename it,\nso go a little bit to the right.\n\n660\n00:34:21.775 --> 00:34:24.668\nAnd I'm gonna come over here\nto my character color and\n\n661\n00:34:24.668 --> 00:34:28.413\neven though I know it says red,\nwe'll go with magenta, there we go.\n\n662\n00:34:28.413 --> 00:34:31.570\nOkay, it's reddish,\nyou can see that look at all that.\n\n663\n00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:37.370\nAll the places where I had that red\ncharacter style is going to be changed,\n\n664\n00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.500\nit's pretty awesome.\n\n665\n00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.480\nLet's just go really quickly\non the paragraph styles.\n\n666\n00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:47.780\nMaybe I'll make it to have 18 pt\nletting and then everything changes.\n\n667\n00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.877\nEverywhere that style is, it's gonna go,\nit's pretty awesome, I love styles.\n\n668\n00:34:51.877 --> 00:34:55.049\n>> So when you apply that style that\nactually stays linked to the style, and\n\n669\n00:34:55.049 --> 00:34:57.315\nthen you can just make\na change to the style itself.\n\n670\n00:34:57.315 --> 00:35:01.400\n>> Mm-hm, and that's where, if you have\na 200 page book, that's where you want it.\n\n671\n00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.285\nNow, you're not gonna design 200\npage books in Illustrator, but.\n\n672\n00:35:04.285 --> 00:35:10.530\n[LAUGH] If I'm doing extensive text\nformatting, I will usually use InDesign.\n\n673\n00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.110\nBecause it's just a little more seamless,\nlike I said.\n\n674\n00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.770\nBut I use Illustrator all the time, and\n\n675\n00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:20.100\nI use styles, and it's there,\njust got to know the pitfalls.\n\n676\n00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.410\n>> Very good, Vaughn, all right, a lot\nof great stuff there about formatting.\n\n677\n00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:24.940\nLooking at the character formatting,\n\n678\n00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:29.670\nthe individual letters or characters\nas well as that paragraph formatting.\n\n679\n00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:32.440\nWe thank you for that,\nappreciate those fantastic demos.\n\n680\n00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.670\nHope everyone out there enjoyed watching,\nsigning off for IT ProTv,\n\n681\n00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:36.990\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n682\n00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.590\n>> I'm Vaughn Smith.\n\n683\n00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.187\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n684\n00:35:39.187 --> 00:35:47.290\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015,\n\n3\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.000\nand, specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at formatting.\n\n4\n00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.761\nNow, we've already taken a look\nat character formatting and\n\n5\n00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:32.040\nparagraph formatting, now, we're gonna\nbe looking at OpenType font formatting.\n\n6\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.180\nWho knew?\n\n7\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.390\nI'll tell you who did, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.320\nHow are you Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.050\n>> I'm good.\nGlad to be back to explain to you ,what\n\n10\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.010\nopen type font formatting is all about.\n\n11\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.990\nSo like he was saying, we have gone\nover the character formatting and\n\n12\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.250\nthe paragraph formatting.\n\n13\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.370\nSome other lessons or episodes, and\n\n14\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.610\nwe spent a lot of time in\nthe topography theory.\n\n15\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.600\nEpisode talking about the characteristics\nof an OpenType font and\n\n16\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.150\nwe went over the ligatures and\nthe swatches, and all that fun stuff.\n\n17\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.410\nSo I wanted to dedicate this episode\nto showing you how and where,\n\n18\n00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.900\nyou can actually do that\nformatting in Illustrator.\n\n19\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.480\nSo, let's just go ahead and get started.\n\n20\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.510\nI have the topography file\nthat I was working from when\n\n21\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.140\nwe were doing our demonstrations of what\nis a ligature, and the small caps, and so\n\n22\n00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.280\nwe need to find that because you\ncan't really type in an F and\n\n23\n00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.450\nL together and that ST, unless you've\ngot some fancy keyboard that has that.\n\n24\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.880\n>> Yeah, no I looked on my keyboard,\nit's not there.\n\n25\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.240\nAnd I can tell you as well that,\nhitting the F and\n\n26\n00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.370\nthe L at the same time,\ndoes not give you your expected result.\n\n27\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.130\nSo hopefully, you can help me with that.\n\n28\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.450\n>> Yeah,\nprobably is not gonna do very well.\n\n29\n00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.080\nMight make you kind of angry,\nmake some weird noises happening.\n\n30\n00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.250\n>> Yeah, it started beeping funny.\n\n31\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.785\n>> Yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:46.718\n[LAUGH].\n\n33\n00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:51.309\nYeah, exactly,\ncuz when we have these characters,\n\n34\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.510\nwe can't type them in, so\nwhere are we gonna find them?\n\n35\n00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.260\nSo let me show you the panels,\nwhere we gonna go to.\n\n36\n00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.650\nWe're gonna go to our Window\nmenu to find our panels.\n\n37\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.200\nWe're gonna go into the Type section and\nwe're gonna go into our Open Type panel.\n\n38\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.980\nNow, this is just one of\nthe panels that we're going to use\n\n39\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.470\nwhen talking about how to\ndo OpenType formatting.\n\n40\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.130\nThe other one we're going\nto use is the Glyphs panel.\n\n41\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.890\n>> What's a glyph?\n\n42\n00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.528\n>> A glyph is a hieroglyphical\ncharacter that represents a character.\n\n43\n00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:29.865\n[LAUGH] I know there was the hi,\nnow I can't even say it.\n\n44\n00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:30.815\nHieroglyphs?\n\n45\n00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:32.430\n>> Yes.\n>> Hieroglyphical [CROSSTALK]\n\n46\n00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.096\n>> Yes, there you go.\n\n47\n00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:35.810\nThe cave painting stuff, right?\n\n48\n00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.510\n>> Yes.\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] that's what I was\n\n49\n00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.750\nsaying about, right?\n\n50\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.470\nEgyptian hiero, heiro, I'm not gonna be\nable to get that out of about anymore.\n\n51\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.651\nSo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n52\n00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:44.691\n>> It's a character, and\n\n53\n00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:49.890\nit's more than just our regular\nalphanumerical characters like our As and\n\n54\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.360\nour ones six season things.\n\n55\n00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.330\nThose ones beyond it.\n\n56\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.280\nLike the degree sign, that's one that\nI have to use from time to time.\n\n57\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.280\nThat's not a key, so where do I find it?\n\n58\n00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.600\nThat's in the Glyphs panel.\n\n59\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.260\nAnd it has all of the extended items in\ncharacters of a open type font, okay.\n\n60\n00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.790\n>> Right,\ncuz we learn that in our typography,\n\n61\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.231\nwhere these open types have a lot more\nroom for these special characters.\n\n62\n00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.650\n>> 65,536 characters to be exact [LAUGH]\n>> Very nice.\n\n63\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.610\n>> All right, so\n>> Let me show you some of\n\n64\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.920\nthe examples in here.\n\n65\n00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.760\nSo right here, we'll start with\nour regular ligatures right here.\n\n66\n00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.690\nIn this one, these are two characters,\nthere's an f and there's an l, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.600\nAnd you can actually see while I'm\nhighlighting the characters in the text\n\n68\n00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.400\nthat I have on the on the screen, It's\nactually showing you in this like table,\n\n69\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.570\nif you wanna say,\nof what glyph this is coming from.\n\n70\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.243\n>> I saw it changing as you were\nclicking on the different ones.\n\n71\n00:03:51.243 --> 00:03:53.630\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd this,there's like there's codes so\n\n72\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.140\nlike that f has a specific code and\nthat kinda goes back to.\n\n73\n00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.330\nSomething your probably know\nabout like with Unicode and-\n\n74\n00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.590\n>> Yeah, the old ASCII days,\n\n75\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.000\nwhen you could program in those codes,\nyes.\n\n76\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.040\n>> Yeah exactly, so\nit kind of all builds upon this,\n\n77\n00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.550\nbecause that's what computers do,\nis they build upon where they came from.\n\n78\n00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.970\nSo, we've got specific codes, and\nyou can see if I go over to this one,\n\n79\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.660\nthis is actually showing you\nright here that there is, and\n\n80\n00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.040\nyou can see up at the top\nof that glyph Panel.\n\n81\n00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.830\nI don't know if it'll, no I didn't\nthink I could grab it really quickly,\n\n82\n00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.398\nbut you can see at the top it\ndoes say standard ligatures.\n\n83\n00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:26.040\nIt's showing\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n84\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.650\n>> you that this is what they're\nconsidering a literature of that font.\n\n85\n00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.160\nAnother place that you can see that\nis over here in the OpenType panel,\n\n86\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.350\nis you can see that this little\nstandard ligatures button is on.\n\n87\n00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.540\nSee it's like press down,\nif you want to say as opposed to this one.\n\n88\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.970\nSee here,\nthis one uncrossed the open type panel.\n\n89\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.300\nNone of the little buttons are on and\nthis one, that button is on.\n\n90\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.060\nSo I can change that if I wanted\nto make that into a ligature.\n\n91\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.410\nAnd just to demonstrate here,\nif I click on one that doesn't have it.\n\n92\n00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.600\nClick that little button right there.\n\n93\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.185\nDo you see the little?\n\n94\n00:05:01.185 --> 00:05:02.460\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n95\n00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.590\nOops I hit the wrong key again.\n\n96\n00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.560\nSee?\nThere, there, yes.\n\n97\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.970\nSo I was basically saying, yes,\nI want you to enable the ligatures for\n\n98\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.730\nthis particular text box or\nthis item that I have selected.\n\n99\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.888\nSo you do really have to like, you can\ntype regularly and then you go back and\n\n100\n00:05:18.888 --> 00:05:21.660\ndo all that kind of stylistic\npreferences that you\n\n101\n00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.450\nwanna do\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n102\n00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.500\n>> by turning on and off these figures.\n\n103\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.690\nThis is just one way to do it so\n\n104\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.240\nwe'll just kinda keep on going, going\nthrough the open type panel, that is.\n\n105\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.415\nSo for example here, like in the swashes,\nnow this is Garamond pro and you can see\n\n106\n00:05:35.415 --> 00:05:40.119\ndown the bottom here that it is showing me\nthat whatever font this thing is formatted\n\n107\n00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:45.040\nin, it's gonna show in the glimpse panel\nand the character panel, of course.\n\n108\n00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.530\nAnd so, there's the regular a and\nthen nothing across the top here, right?.\n\n109\n00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.410\nCome to this fancy A and\nthat's because I have the swashes button\n\n110\n00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.700\non to say yes enable swashes for\nthis particular character.\n\n111\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.700\nNow that doesn't mean every character\nis going to have a swash or\n\n112\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.080\nevery character is going to\nautomatically become a ligature,\n\n113\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.160\nbecause it's only specific characters\nthat can even create ligatures and not,\n\n114\n00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.000\nevery font set will even have\nthe option of allowing you for swashes.\n\n115\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000\nEvery font has different\ngroups of different\n\n116\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.360\ngroups of open type characteristics\nthat it decides it wants to have.\n\n117\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.090\nSome have more than others,\nsome don't have any.\n\n118\n00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.330\nEven if it's an open type font but\n\n119\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.800\nif doesn't have to have that extra\nextension, if you wanna say.\n\n120\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.750\n>> The opportunities there but\nif the developer of that font didn't\n\n121\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.040\ntake the time to make those swashes,\nthey're not gonna be a part of that font.\n\n122\n00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.910\n>> Exactly.\n\n123\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.330\nAnd you can see here, on this SWASHES,\nthis is just regular old Ariel.\n\n124\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.210\nYou can see none of these options\nare even, I can't do a SWASHES here.\n\n125\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.960\nThere is no A swash for\nthis particular font,\n\n126\n00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.285\nso just because it can doesn't mean it\ndoes if that makes any sense [LAUGH].\n\n127\n00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:04.510\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> All right, so\n\n128\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.140\nagain back here there's that b and\nthe fancy b and I can go in there, and\n\n129\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.750\njust click the swash and\nthen it made it that way.\n\n130\n00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.050\nSo that's how I made all of these\nthese things at the ordinals.\n\n131\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:22.220\nI type in the 1st and then I just\nduplicate or alt drag to put it further.\n\n132\n00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.000\nI just turn this one on to say,\nturn on the ordinal for this one.\n\n133\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.653\nOkay.\nBut again,\n\n134\n00:07:26.653 --> 00:07:28.445\nhad to have the font that would allow for\nit.\n\n135\n00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:31.582\nAnd so,\nthat's basically how it works, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:34.620\nYou just format it when you want it to,\nand\n\n137\n00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.600\nyou can do the stylistic sets, because\nthis particular font had stylistic sets.\n\n138\n00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.800\nNow, with the ornaments, that's not\nsomething, I can't type this letter in.\n\n139\n00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.420\nI can't type this weird floopy thing.\n\n140\n00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.309\nIt, that's a floopy thing.\n\n141\n00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:47.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> Floopy thing, okay.\n\n142\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.580\n>> That's what we've called it today.\n\n143\n00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.475\n>> Again, it's another one of those,\nthere's no key on my keyboard.\n\n144\n00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:52.876\nFor the floopy thing.\n\n145\n00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:54.550\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So I can't type it in and\n\n146\n00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.357\nthen try to convert it.\n\n147\n00:07:56.357 --> 00:07:57.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n148\n00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.299\n>> Can't type in the floopy.\n\n149\n00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:00.960\nYeah. So. [LAUGH] So if I go.\n\n150\n00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.580\nI'm just gonna show you really quickly.\n\n151\n00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.800\nI'm just gonna grab the T tool and\nI'm gonna type in and I'm gonna say.\n\n152\n00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.310\nNinety one and I wanna out degrees.\n\n153\n00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.200\nI need to put the degree sign in there.\n\n154\n00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.220\nSo, I don't know where to go.\n\n155\n00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.370\nAll right, well that's where\nthe glyphs panel can come in to play.\n\n156\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.160\nI can actually insert in the glyphs\nthat I want to put in just like,\n\n157\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.508\nI would be typing a regular character.\n\n158\n00:08:25.508 --> 00:08:27.640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And you could have done this with this\n\n159\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.390\nthe fancy A, or the fancy B,\n\n160\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.510\nI was just showing you the first\nway of typing it and formatting it.\n\n161\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.530\nNow, it's like no,\nI want a specific character.\n\n162\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.410\nI think it's that one, is that the one?\n\n163\n00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:44.350\nAnd all I gotta do is just double click,\ncuz my flashing cursor was in a text box\n\n164\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.990\nor in an area I was allowing to type in\ntext, so it's like yup, there's my degree.\n\n165\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.700\nSo now it's 91 degrees.\n\n166\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.490\n>> Very cool.\n\n167\n00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.080\n>> Or if I wanted to say you know,\n64 cents or whatever.\n\n168\n00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.200\nI think there's a cents\nsomewhere around here.\n\n169\n00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.810\nSo There it is.\n\n170\n00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.670\nThere's one.\n\n171\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.170\nSo, so\nyou can do all kinds of those things\n\n172\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.790\n>> Hey did you move that?\n\n173\n00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:04.770\n>> Yeah, sorry, sorry.\n\n174\n00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.570\nSo you can.\nOops.\n\n175\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.914\nSorry using my wrong keyboard\nshortcuts for there.\n\n176\n00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:08.439\n>> There we go.\n\n177\n00:09:08.439 --> 00:09:12.830\n>> So you could just type it in 91 and\nthen there's my degree sign,\n\n178\n00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:13.580\nwhich is right there.\n\n179\n00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.500\nI actually just knew it was\ngoing to be in that section, so\n\n180\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.770\nI was just like there's the degree.\n\n181\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.820\nBut sometimes you do have to search.\n\n182\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.705\nAnd sometimes, it's like I see what looks\nlike a degree but it's in the wrong area.\n\n183\n00:09:24.705 --> 00:09:25.440\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n184\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.600\nyou kind of gotta search for\nit a little bit but there you go.\n\n185\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.350\nAnd there should be ornaments somewhere\nin here, maybe this particular font\n\n186\n00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.880\ndoesn't have a lot of fancy ornaments, so\nthat's where I could always switch it.\n\n187\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.745\nI think that's where [INAUDIBLE]\nPro had some fancy ones in here.\n\n188\n00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:48.800\nSo I can switch fonts and\ngo down, there's some ones.\n\n189\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.372\nLet's put put a little moon in there so\nthere you go.\n\n190\n00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:53.315\n>> Nice.\n>> It's 91 degrees at night,\n\n191\n00:09:53.315 --> 00:09:56.809\nwhich is about right for Florida\n>> that's a typical Florida summer evening\n\n192\n00:09:56.809 --> 00:10:00.915\n>> Exactly, right, all right perfect, so\n\n193\n00:10:00.915 --> 00:10:05.965\njust to continue on, just a few other\nlittle things is dealing with numbers\n\n194\n00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:09.895\nokay and fractions are the same thing\nas like just coming up here and\n\n195\n00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:12.620\nclicking on the open type font\nto go ahead and convert it.\n\n196\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.040\nOr finding that particular\nglyph in the glyphs panel and\n\n197\n00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.780\nthen inserting it like you would a text.\n\n198\n00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.280\nBut how it treats your numbers,\nthis is a little bit different.\n\n199\n00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.610\nSo you can see that here,\nin the open type panel,\n\n200\n00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.440\nwhen I have this set of numbers selected\nthe default, it's showing you right here\n\n201\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.750\nin the figure cuz these are figures,\nnot just alpha characters.\n\n202\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.940\nSo it's saying it's a default figure.\n\n203\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.800\nIf I click on this one,\nyou can see that this one says,\n\n204\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.080\nit is a proportional lining.\n\n205\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.390\nThis one's too is a tabular lining.\n\n206\n00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.710\nSo I actually just took this first one,\nduplicated it, and then just\n\n207\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.620\nchange the type of figure configuration\n>> Using the drop down list on the panel.\n\n208\n00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.950\n>> Exactly, and so\n>> So I just, I could take here.\n\n209\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.260\nAnd I could change it.\n\n210\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.470\nAnd I could go to the tabular lining.\n\n211\n00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.340\nWell, wait.\nHere, let's go.\n\n212\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.885\nIt's proportional, and\nyou can see how it's actually changing.\n\n213\n00:11:03.885 --> 00:11:04.920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n214\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.350\n>> The formatting of my numbers.\n\n215\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.390\nSame thing with the old style figures,\n\n216\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.680\nto make those numbers that\nlook like the houses.\n\n217\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.795\nThe numbers on the houses.\n\n218\n00:11:12.795 --> 00:11:13.330\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or whatever.\n\n219\n00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.240\nSo I took the default, and\nthen I went into proportional.\n\n220\n00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.230\nOld style or the tabular old style rather,\nhere as how i\n\n221\n00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.190\nwanted to just kind of fancy it up or\ngussy up this text\n\n222\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.423\na little bit as my dad would always say\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n223\n00:11:29.423 --> 00:11:30.700\n>> Gussy it up [LAUGH] So,\n\n224\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:36.300\nthat is really about it that I wanted\nto cover on open type font formatting.\n\n225\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.960\nAnd the Glyphs panel and open type panel\nso that you know where it is at and\n\n226\n00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.330\nhow to work with it.\n\n227\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.810\nYou don't ever have to use this stuff.\n\n228\n00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.230\nAgain, it's really personal opinion.\n\n229\n00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.700\nIt's that extra little oomph that\nif you wanted to give your font for\n\n230\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.920\nwhatever which reason,\nit is there if you pick the right font.\n\n231\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.830\n>> It does seem like there is\na little bit of extra work involved.\n\n232\n00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.072\nI know I've seen some books to where\nlike the first letter will have\n\n233\n00:12:03.072 --> 00:12:06.760\nthe swash of the page or\nof that chapter, but nothing else.\n\n234\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.810\nAnd maybe this explains, why it's not\nas easy as just typing on the keyboard.\n\n235\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.230\n>> Yeah, it does involve more work.\n\n236\n00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:18.700\nIt really, if a work lends itself\nto having that, that's great.\n\n237\n00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.930\nIf you're just writing up a flyer that's\ngoing to go for just informational\n\n238\n00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.720\npurposes, you probably don't want to get\ntoo fancy, but it's there if you want to.\n\n239\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.150\n>> Very, very cool stuff,\nwe appreciate that.\n\n240\n00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.290\nNow, we all know about\nopen type font formatting.\n\n241\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:34.930\nWe thank you for that,\n\n242\n00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.050\nthose great demonstrations,\nhope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n243\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.300\nSigning off for IT ProTv,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n244\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.170\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n245\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.643\n>>

00:00:19.551\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today,\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:24.540\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at adding text.\n\n5\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.510\nWe've gotta be able to get that\ntext into our document, so\n\n6\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.780\nwe can apply some of\nthat fancy formatting and\n\n7\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.870\nall the other stuff that we've\nlearned about and are going to learn.\n\n8\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.820\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Miss Vaughn Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.770\nHow are you doing Vaughn?\n\n10\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.510\n>> Great.\n\n11\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.730\nReady to add text to our document.\n\n12\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.400\nBecause if we're going to be saying\nsomething, we probably need some words.\n\n13\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.370\nWell, I guess we could use some pictures\nbecause pictures can have just as much\n\n14\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.040\nimpact of what we're\ntrying to communicate.\n\n15\n00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.163\nBut.\n>> We've got a thousand words.\n\n16\n00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:56.780\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, they do, or just one word.\n\n17\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.550\n>> Or just one.\n\n18\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.250\n>> Yes, but this is not an episode about\nimages, it's an episode about text.\n\n19\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.750\n>> Okay.\n>> So.\n\n20\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.321\n>> Get back to it then.\n\n21\n00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.364\n>> So we're actually going to use our\n\n22\n00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:09.004\nwords to communicate what we wanna say.\n[LAUGH] So,\n\n23\n00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.490\nthere's quite a few ways that we\ncan add text into a document, so\n\n24\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.570\nI'm gonna walk you through that and\ngo through some other ways that we can\n\n25\n00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.480\njust do some formatting besides\njust the font and other things.\n\n26\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.870\nSo, let's just jump right in so\nI can get rolling on this.\n\n27\n00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.460\nAll right so adding text.\n\n28\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.620\nAnd by the way, this is just a brand\nnew document that I created.\n\n29\n00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.420\nIt's in the Print mode so\nit's in the CMYK.\n\n30\n00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240\nI just wanted a piece of paper, basically.\n\n31\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.620\nTake out a piece of paper so\nI can write on it.\n\n32\n00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.380\nAll right.\n\n33\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.830\nSo if we're gonna add text, we're gonna\ngo to the T tool or the Type tool.\n\n34\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.340\nHotkey is T.\n\n35\n00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.670\nAnd just to show you,\nthere is a group of text tools in here.\n\n36\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.880\nI can pull off the tear-off if we want to.\n\n37\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.600\nDo I use every single one of these?\n\n38\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.490\nNot necessarily because I don't have\nto use every single one of them.\n\n39\n00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.680\nBut the T tool is your main one.\n\n40\n00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.550\nOkay, so you get your cursor ready to go.\n\n41\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.130\nNow there's two ways that\nyou can use the type tool.\n\n42\n00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.610\nYou can type at a point, or what they\ncall point type, or you can do area type.\n\n43\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.850\nLet me explain what that means.\n\n44\n00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.560\nAll right.\nSo I'm just gonna zoom in.\n\n45\n00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.580\nType at a point, or a point type, is where\nyou just take the T tool and just click.\n\n46\n00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.830\nYou just click and say I wanna add text.\n\n47\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.290\nSo you just Single click and\n\n48\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.740\nthere's my flashing cursor and\nI say like, hello world.\n\n49\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.491\nWhoops, hello world, wow okay [LAUGH].\n\n50\n00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:31.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's not judge me on how I can type.\n\n51\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.840\nAll right so here I go, hello world.\n\n52\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.740\nThat's it.\n\n53\n00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.870\nWhen I'm done I go back to the black\narrow tool to go ahead to complete that.\n\n54\n00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.740\nBecause that's one thing that when you're\nin the T tool when you're trying to\n\n55\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.640\nclick off of this like you would in a\nregular like selecting items or something.\n\n56\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.930\nYou don't have the black arrow tool.\n\n57\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.380\nYou've always gotta be careful about that.\n\n58\n00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.630\nIt's like I'm going back\nto the black arrow tool.\n\n59\n00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.990\n>> Because you've clicked somewhere\nelse it gonna create another type point?\n\n60\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.940\n>> Correct, yes.\n\n61\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.700\nOr it's really just, I can't get\nout of where you're at right now so\n\n62\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.160\nI don't know what you want me to do.\n\n63\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.120\nSo it's either one or the other basically.\n\n64\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.730\n>> Could you bump that\nfont just a wee bit?\n\n65\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.490\nI know it's not important what you're\ntyping but it's so small, my eyes are old.\n\n66\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.190\n>> How about that?\n\n67\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.874\nIs that better for you?\n\n68\n00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:14.110\n[LAUGH] All right, so I've already\ngone back into the black area so\n\n69\n00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.360\nnow I have this Text box selected,\nso what can I do with it?\n\n70\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.100\nNow, type on a point is where you can\nkinda treat it like a regular object,\n\n71\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.890\nin a sense I wanna make this bigger or\nI wanna make it smaller.\n\n72\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.030\nYou just take the corner,\nand I'm gonna hold my Shift\n\n73\n00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.440\nkey to constrain my proportions, and\nI'm gonna click hold and drag, and\n\n74\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.420\nI just make this bigger, because maybe\nI'm making a headline in my document.\n\n75\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.820\nI'm like, okay that's how big\nI want it to be, that's fine.\n\n76\n00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.900\nBut you also can stretch it.\n\n77\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.340\nYou can extend it out and\nthat's where we're doing\n\n78\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.385\nthe scaling in the character\nform out sorry character panel.\n\n79\n00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:55.725\nLet me go ahead and\npull that up since we're talking about it.\n\n80\n00:03:57.015 --> 00:03:58.805\nSo you can see.\n\n81\n00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.625\n>> Yes the horizontal and\nthe vertical scaling.\n\n82\n00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:02.115\nWe can type a number in there.\n\n83\n00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:05.960\n>> Exactly yeah because I was going\nbackwards in how I teach this.\n\n84\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.690\nMaybe you're watching this first.\n\n85\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.290\nI was showing you all the different\nways you can format first and\n\n86\n00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.530\nthen how to add it because I\njust like to do it that way.\n\n87\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.930\nSo you can see that\nthe scaling has changed.\n\n88\n00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.780\nAnd so if I change this it's going to\nsquash this and it's going to scrunch it.\n\n89\n00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.360\nAnd it's going to treat it just\nlike it would if it was a square or\n\n90\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.040\nan object, it's still text,\nbut it acts like that.\n\n91\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.610\nSo that's type on a point.\n\n92\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.510\nOkay, you just click and type.\n\n93\n00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.340\nSo I'm gonna go back to the T tool.\n\n94\n00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.110\nAnd I'm gonna do one more thing with that\ntype on a point just to show you if I say,\n\n95\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.130\none and then enter,\ntwo enter, three enter.\n\n96\n00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.500\nYou can create your own paragraphs\nby hitting the enter key, okay,\n\n97\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.465\nand that's fine but\nit's still type on a point.\n\n98\n00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:56.300\nIt's still gonna stretch,\nif you change the size of the text frame.\n\n99\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.480\n>> And even though you hit\nenter a couple of times there,\n\n100\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.830\nit's still a single object.\n\n101\n00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.380\n>> Yes, yes, it is paragraphs within\nthat text frame, if you want to call it.\n\n102\n00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.070\n>> Okay.\n>> So now let me go to the other way\n\n103\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.570\nyou could do this.\n\n104\n00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.740\nThis is area type.\n\n105\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.280\nWell, it's just area type.\n\n106\n00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.960\nSo I'm gonna take the T tool, and\nI'm gonna click, hold, and drag.\n\n107\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.930\nAnd create a text frame first.\n\n108\n00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.660\nAnd this is the way you have\nto do this in enDesign.\n\n109\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.310\nYou always have to draw a frame\nbefore you can type anything in.\n\n110\n00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.640\nSo if you're coming\nover from that program,\n\n111\n00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.840\nthat's probably the way you're\nused to doing it, okay?\n\n112\n00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.790\nSo if I then click, hold and drag and\nI type in Hello World, okay there's that.\n\n113\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.340\nAnd if I take the black arrow tool and\nI start changing this text frame.\n\n114\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.100\nYou see how it doesn't matter if I'm\nchanging the size of the text frame,\n\n115\n00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.410\nit's not changing the size of the text\nbecause it's just changing the frame.\n\n116\n00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.620\nThat's all it is.\n\n117\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.150\nNow, how that can be beneficial\nis if I take this and\n\n118\n00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.090\nI wanted to start putting\nthis down on another line.\n\n119\n00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.870\nIt's the words are going to start\nwrapping within the text frame.\n\n120\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.800\nOkay so, if I kinda come back here and\njust say this is some more text.\n\n121\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.430\nWhoops some, here's some more text.\n\n122\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.150\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n123\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.160\ntype like this because [LAUGH] I'm\nnot doing a very good job of typing.\n\n124\n00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.250\nSo you can see if I take this and\nstart changing the size,\n\n125\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.180\nthe text frame is going to change\nthe way the text wraps in the frame.\n\n126\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.962\nThat's way it's a little bit easier\nmaybe to demonstrate there with\n\n127\n00:06:27.962 --> 00:06:30.693\na little bit more words then just that.\n\n128\n00:06:30.693 --> 00:06:35.519\nSo that's difference click and\ntype, or click, hold and drag and\n\n129\n00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:40.258\nthen type, point or aerial type,\nall right and I actually lost my\n\n130\n00:06:40.258 --> 00:06:45.714\ncharacter panel when I was doing some\nweird keyboard thing, right there.\n\n131\n00:06:45.714 --> 00:06:47.300\nSo those are the two main\nways you could do it.\n\n132\n00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.310\nNow the cool thing about the newer\nversion of Illustrator and\n\n133\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.320\nI can't remember exactly when they\nstarted this is that you can switch\n\n134\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.170\nin between those two types of\ntext frames that you can have.\n\n135\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.140\nThe point type or\nthe area point, which was huge.\n\n136\n00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.420\nWhen they added this I was very,\nvery happy.\n\n137\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.850\nBecause otherwise you would of had to,\nif I wanted this to become area type,\n\n138\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.830\nI would have to select it, cut it out,\nmake a new text frame, put it back in, and\n\n139\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.630\nvice versa.\n\n140\n00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.430\nSo it was kind of not very\neasy to switch back and forth.\n\n141\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.125\nPermit not being what it was.\n\n142\n00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:24.740\n[LAUGH] So now,\nyou have the very end of a text frame.\n\n143\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.470\nYou have this little on the right hand\nside, this little circle-y handle thing.\n\n144\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.310\nOkay.\n\n145\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.645\nThis is if when I click on it,\nokay, it's going to.\n\n146\n00:07:33.645 --> 00:07:35.055\nHere let me move this.\n\n147\n00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:38.045\nIt actually says, I'm single clicking\njust to show you that it is saying,\n\n148\n00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:40.195\ndouble click to convert to area type.\n\n149\n00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:44.860\nAs opposed to if I had this one,\nsee over here.\n\n150\n00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.800\nIf I single click on it,\nit's going to say,\n\n151\n00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.213\ndouble click to convert to point type.\n\n152\n00:07:54.213 --> 00:07:56.758\nSo, it's allowing me to switch back and\nforth.\n\n153\n00:07:56.758 --> 00:07:57.780\nHuge addition.\n\n154\n00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.138\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah, major for me.\n\n155\n00:07:59.138 --> 00:08:01.332\nSo, if I then double click on this.\n\n156\n00:08:01.332 --> 00:08:05.631\nNow this has now become a area type, and\n\n157\n00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:12.050\nif I double click it again\nthen it will okay yes I know.\n\n158\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.820\nIt gave me a warning, I didn't explain to\nyou what it was cuz I wasn't ready to show\n\n159\n00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.500\nyou that just yet, so I wasn't trying to-\n>> We'll come back to that.\n\n160\n00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.880\n>> Yeah I wasn't trying to skip over that,\nbut it will go ahead and\n\n161\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.310\nconvert back and forth.\n\n162\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.190\nVery, very handy.\n\n163\n00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.640\n>> I can see where that\nwould really be convenient.\n\n164\n00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.860\nYou might wanna stretch that text out so\nyou convert it to that point type.\n\n165\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.390\nStretch it out real quick, and then\nconvert it right back to an area type.\n\n166\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.170\nSo that you can change\nthe size of the column or\n\n167\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.330\nwhatever you might be trying to do.\n\n168\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.490\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n169\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.755\nAnd I think it'll really demonstrate\nthe point, the point, hah.\n\n170\n00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:47.830\n[LAUGH] When I show you how\nyou can get bigger chunks,\n\n171\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.640\nif you want to say of\ntext in your document.\n\n172\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.000\nBecause a lot of times, and by the way\nI just did a Ctrl+A really quickly and\n\n173\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.060\njust deleted everything to\ngive myself a clean slate.\n\n174\n00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.190\nI just didn't want to throw you off there.\n\n175\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:05.970\nIf I'm creating a brochure, or\nwhatever I'm doing for whatever worked.\n\n176\n00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.630\nI'm probably gonna be provided the text,\n\n177\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.320\nI'm not gonna necessarily\ncreate all the text.\n\n178\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.590\nSo maybe there's an explanation\nof the company or\n\n179\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.390\nthe product that I'm making something for.\n\n180\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.360\n>> They give you the words you don't\nhave to type it all up, come up with it.\n\n181\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.220\n>> Correct, and\nmaybe they gave it to me in a Word format,\n\n182\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.720\nor some kind of text format,\nthere's different ways, so\n\n183\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.170\nI wanna show you that and\nshow you some of the pitfalls of it.\n\n184\n00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.670\nAnd there's at least something to watch\nfor, that's the most important thing.\n\n185\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.080\nSo I have some text in a Word document,\n\n186\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.570\nI actually have two different\nWord documents here.\n\n187\n00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.810\nAnd this could be from anywhere,\n\n188\n00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:44.040\nyou could be copying it from a website or\nsome type of text.\n\n189\n00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.280\nIf I select this,\ncuz maybe I wanna go ahead and\n\n190\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.530\nget this bunch of text in here\ninto my Illustrator document.\n\n191\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.250\nSo if I just copy, just regular old copy,\nCtrl+C, or Cmd+C, and\n\n192\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.230\nthen come over to Illustrator,\nand then just paste.\n\n193\n00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.770\nOkay, I'm going to Ctrl or\nCmd+V, just to show you.\n\n194\n00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.800\nI wanna show you what it does.\n\n195\n00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.140\nIf I paste it, well [LAUGH] there's\ntwo things that are gonna happen.\n\n196\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.160\nOne.\n\n197\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.856\nWhat is that?\n\n198\n00:10:08.856 --> 00:10:10.463\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n199\n00:10:10.463 --> 00:10:12.280\nThat normally shouldn't happen.\n\n200\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.119\nI will tell you,\nI have no idea what's going on.\n\n201\n00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:15.750\n>> Really?\n\n202\n00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.940\n>> Of why, for some reason, on my Mac.\n\n203\n00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.050\nI've tried it on my Windows machine?\n\n204\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:20.670\nTotally fine.\n\n205\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.820\nFor some reason, I can't get Illustrator\nto just do a straight up copy and\n\n206\n00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.840\npaste from Word to Illustrator.\n\n207\n00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.830\nIt's doing some really,\nreally wonky things.\n\n208\n00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.510\nBut that's okay cuz I\nknow how I can fix it.\n\n209\n00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:39.370\nSo, if you get it that way, whether or not\nit does some weird, languagey thing here.\n\n210\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:45.560\nThe main point I'm trying to show you is\nit will always come in as type point,\n\n211\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.790\nokay, or point type.\n\n212\n00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.280\nAnd that could have been from,\ncuz I went out here,\n\n213\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.660\nbecause if some, if you're not familiar,\nplaceholder text, right?\n\n214\n00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.160\n>> Yes.\n\n215\n00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.480\n>> If I came into here and\ncopied it from here,\n\n216\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.855\nso this is actually going to come in as\nregular text now because I tried this.\n\n217\n00:11:04.855 --> 00:11:08.625\nSo it came in but it's not showing\nas like a paragraph or anything.\n\n218\n00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:11.025\nThere's this big long,\nyou probably can't even see it.\n\n219\n00:11:11.025 --> 00:11:11.905\n>> Real long line of text.\n\n220\n00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:12.535\n>> Yeah.\n\n221\n00:11:12.535 --> 00:11:15.960\nIt's anything that you\njust straight up copy.\n\n222\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.940\nAnd paste and the illustrator, if it's\ntext it will always come in this way.\n\n223\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.270\nOkay, so don't.\n\n224\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.100\nBasically don't do that, okay.\n\n225\n00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.730\nDon't do it that way.\n\n226\n00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.700\nWhat can do if I come back to here,\nif I copy.\n\n227\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.700\nOkay, so I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n228\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.220\ncopy from Word,\nswitch back over to Illustrator.\n\n229\n00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.040\nI know that there's two ways\nto type in text, right?\n\n230\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.760\nI'll just grab my T tool,\nmake a text frame first, and then paste.\n\n231\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.600\nNow it comes in my normal,\nso that was like,\n\n232\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.700\nI know I had a backup of why it\nwasn't working because I would never.\n\n233\n00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.210\nI know now not to just straight up\ncopy and paste Word to Illustrator.\n\n234\n00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.130\nSo I make a text frame first,\nit comes in as area text.\n\n235\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:01.190\nAnd then I can go ahead and have it move\naround within a text frame the way I would\n\n236\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.400\nnormally want larger\namounts of text to come in.\n\n237\n00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.960\nSo that's a little trick,\nclick and drag and\n\n238\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.780\nmake a text frame before you paste in\nanything copied from somewhere else.\n\n239\n00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.550\nThat will make it a lot easier for you.\n\n240\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.410\n>> Very good tip.\n>> So\n\n241\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.450\nthere is a few other things that I\nwant to show you about area type text\n\n242\n00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.210\nthat you need to watch out for.\n\n243\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.930\nSo we have got our text frame,\nwe are going to move it around.\n\n244\n00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.750\nSo if I start changing the size of This.\n\n245\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.570\nNow if I make it this\nbig that's great right.\n\n246\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:34.210\nThe frame is still big enough\nto accompany all my text.\n\n247\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:34.820\nOkay.\n\n248\n00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.110\nBut if I make it smaller.\n\n249\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.350\nLike if I make it this big.\n\n250\n00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.030\nYou can see that I know\nthat there's more text and\n\n251\n00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.470\nthere's another indication to me that.\n\n252\n00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:48.060\nThere is more text that's in this frame\nthat's not showing because the frame\n\n253\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.010\nis too small, and\nthat is the little red plus sign.\n\n254\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:57.170\nThis little red plus sign indicates\nto you that there is overflow text,\n\n255\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.100\nand it's not showing everything\nthat can be in there.\n\n256\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.900\nAnd that's actually one of the,\n\n257\n00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.000\nremember back a little while ago where I\nhad changed the Hello World to a aerotype?\n\n258\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.210\nAnd then I made it small and then I tried\nto change it back to a type and a point.\n\n259\n00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.930\nAnd it said don't worry about that.\n\n260\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.880\nIt was actually letting me know that I was\n\n261\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.380\ntrying to make this aerotype\nback into a type and a point.\n\n262\n00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.230\nBut it was saying, hey wait, wait, wait.\n\n263\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.890\nYou had more left over in there,\nthe word world was in there but you\n\n264\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:30.010\nweren't showing it so I'm gonna cut it off\nwhen I switch it back over to type text.\n\n265\n00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.036\nThat's the warning it was giving you so-\n>> If you're not careful it could actually\n\n266\n00:13:34.036 --> 00:13:35.190\ntruncate your text.\n\n267\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.817\nYes, good tech word.\n\n268\n00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:38.542\n>> New vocabulary word.\n\n269\n00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:43.250\n>> Yes, and I use that a lot and\nall that techy stuff you do.\n\n270\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.850\nYes, that's what the warning was and\nI can redo that one for you but\n\n271\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.170\nI just wanted to let you know that\nthat is what is indicating to you.\n\n272\n00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.610\nThere's two ways you can do this,\n\n273\n00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.370\nyou can just go ahead and\nmake the text frame bigger, okay?\n\n274\n00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.070\nOr remember that other little thing that\nwe were doing earlier was that I could\n\n275\n00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.070\njust double-click it at the very end, and\n\n276\n00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.720\nit will go ahead\nautomatically make itself.\n\n277\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.740\nBefore I was showing you could\ndouble-click it to go ahead and\n\n278\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.830\nmake the text frame smaller to\nmatch where the text is but\n\n279\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.170\nyou can do them in reverse.\n\n280\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.220\nThere's overset text, and now I need\nto make the text frame longer so\n\n281\n00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.070\nit can accommodate all that text.\n\n282\n00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.820\nWhich again very, very handy.\n\n283\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.810\nSo if I have, there's some other things\nthat you could if you were having a large\n\n284\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:29.950\namount of text that you needed to, as they\ncall, thread, into multiple text frames.\n\n285\n00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.950\nOkay?\nMaybe you have a pamphlet that's going to\n\n286\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.890\nhave a two context, and you want some of\nit to go here and some of it to go there.\n\n287\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.730\nAnd you don't want to treat it as two\nseparate none connected text frames\n\n288\n00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.300\nbecause if you start changing one you\nwant it to flow up into the next one.\n\n289\n00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.920\nOkay?\n\n290\n00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.930\nJust kind of like how if you had text in\na Word file across multiple pages it's all\n\n291\n00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.050\none continuous document.\n\n292\n00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.550\nSo if you selected it all and\nchanged the font up two points and\n\n293\n00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.740\nchanged the leading.\n\n294\n00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.780\nEverything's gonna change.\n\n295\n00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.850\nIt's the same idea here,\njust keeps on going.\n\n296\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:07.000\nSo how you can do text threading,\nokay thread your text frames,\n\n297\n00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.370\nis you get the one text frame\nthe size you want it to be.\n\n298\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.100\nOkay, so like here.\n\n299\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.990\nAnd what you're gonna do\nis you're gonna take it,\n\n300\n00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:17.180\nyou're gonna pick up\nthe remaining of the text.\n\n301\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.840\nAnd then drop it somewhere else.\n\n302\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.150\nOkay, it's like pick up and\ndrop, pick up and drop.\n\n303\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.010\nAnd so, but the black arrow told\nus this is not with a T tool.\n\n304\n00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.880\nCuz you're talking about the threading\nthe frames, the text within the frame so\n\n305\n00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.980\nit's not just the text.\n\n306\n00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.690\nIt's kind of one of those weird things.\n\n307\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.780\nAlways go back to the black arrow tool.\n\n308\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.500\nSingle click, one click,\ndon't do it any more than that.\n\n309\n00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:43.200\nAnd you can see that my cursor looks like\na little square with some lines in it.\n\n310\n00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.084\nThat means that it has picked up\nmy text and now I can go ahead and\n\n311\n00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:48.446\nclick hold and drag.\n\n312\n00:15:48.446 --> 00:15:52.325\nAnd I can make another text frame and\nit's going to then pick up all the rest\n\n313\n00:15:52.325 --> 00:15:55.026\nof it and\ndrop it into the text frame that I've got.\n\n314\n00:15:55.026 --> 00:15:59.625\nAnd if I wanted to do it again I can\nclick on that red plus sign Click,\n\n315\n00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.171\nhold and drag and make another one and\n\n316\n00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:07.860\nyou can see that those connecting lines\nare showing you where your threaded text.\n\n317\n00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.310\nThey call them ports,\nit's going out this one right here,\n\n318\n00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.150\nand it's going up and\nconnecting into here,\n\n319\n00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:18.920\nand coming then coming down out through\nthere, and then going over to there.\n\n320\n00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.510\nSo it's showing you where\nall the connections are.\n\n321\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:26.216\nAnd the cool thing is if I'm taking this\nfirst text frame and making it smaller,\n\n322\n00:16:26.216 --> 00:16:30.712\ndo you see how it just then goes ahead and\npushes it all down like pushing it all\n\n323\n00:16:30.712 --> 00:16:34.735\ndown the line to all the different\nframes that it's going through?\n\n324\n00:16:34.735 --> 00:16:38.501\nSo if I then came in to here,\nand I selected all my text, or\n\n325\n00:16:38.501 --> 00:16:42.032\nI just decided to go ahead and\nbump all of this text up,\n\n326\n00:16:42.032 --> 00:16:45.580\nyou could see that it's\nchanging all of them around.\n\n327\n00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.920\nI mean, not the size of text,\ncuz those are all the same size,\n\n328\n00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.430\nbut I'm just trying to show you that\nit's gonna try to move it down.\n\n329\n00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.650\nAnd you can treat it as\none continuous story,\n\n330\n00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.974\nas I sometimes refer to it as, and more\nin InDesign, but it is still a story, so\n\n331\n00:17:00.974 --> 00:17:03.180\nit's a continuous story threaded\nthrough multiple text frames.\n\n332\n00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.000\n>> Very cool.\n\n333\n00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.320\n>> Yes, I love threaded text.\n\n334\n00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.990\n>> Yeah, you see that a lot and I keep\nthinking about newspapers or like you said\n\n335\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.900\npamphlets where you've got a little bit of\ntext, you want that teaser on the front.\n\n336\n00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.370\nBut then it's within the pamphlet or\nthe newspaper or\n\n337\n00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.330\nthe magazine where you\nfind the rest of the data.\n\n338\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.210\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n339\n00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:26.290\nAnd so for me as the designer, if I want\nto treat it all as one, you can thread it.\n\n340\n00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.610\nDoesn't mean you have to.\n\n341\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.050\nAgain, its all up to you\nhow you want to do this.\n\n342\n00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.710\nAll right, so\nthat's kind of a fun little thing.\n\n343\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.380\nI'm gonna go ahead and select all of\nthese and I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n344\n00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.380\ndelete this to give myself a clean slate.\n\n345\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.390\nNow, if you have a text document\nthat has extensive formatting and\n\n346\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:48.810\nyou want to retain that formatting.\n\n347\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.750\nThere is something that you can do with,\ninstead of copying and pasting,\n\n348\n00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.400\nyou can place the text.\n\n349\n00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.450\nAnd that is, that's actually\none of those questions that\n\n350\n00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:03.210\ncame up on the ACA test that I actually\ntook, it was talking about that.\n\n351\n00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.585\nHow can you retain the form,\nor something to that effect.\n\n352\n00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's trying to get the answer out of\n\n353\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.990\nme, that's saying, do you copy and\npaste, or do you place it?\n\n354\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:17.740\nBecause when you copy and paste text,\nit will remove the formatting.\n\n355\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.980\nSo, if I took this, and select this.\n\n356\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.850\nSo you can see that I have some\nstyles in here, I have some color,\n\n357\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.120\nI have some red text, things like that.\n\n358\n00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.670\nIf I copy and come into here,\ngrab my T tool, click,\n\n359\n00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.350\nhold, and drag, and paste,\nnone of that formatting comes over.\n\n360\n00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.780\nIt will always go away.\n\n361\n00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.410\nThat's just what happens when you copy and\npaste it.\n\n362\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:42.300\nBut when you place it,\nyou do have the options of retaining it.\n\n363\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:48.570\nNow, in theory,\nit's also suppose to retain your styles.\n\n364\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.755\nRemember when we were talking\nabout styles in Illustrator?\n\n365\n00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:51.560\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n366\n00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.470\n>> It's just-\n>> A little quirky.\n\n367\n00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.920\n>> It's a little wonky.\n\n368\n00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.630\nYeah, that's my word for it.\n\n369\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.180\nIt doesn't always give you\nexactly what it wants to.\n\n370\n00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:00.810\nAnd again,\n\n371\n00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.440\nif I'm doing extensive typesetting,\nI'm not gonna use Illustrator.\n\n372\n00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.880\nI will use InDesign, because InDesign\nwith that works fantastically, okay?\n\n373\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.310\nIllustrator's just, it's almost there,\nbut not just there.\n\n374\n00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.600\n[LAUGH] So\nlet me just point out that here in Word,\n\n375\n00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.130\nI do have a document that\ndoes have some styles.\n\n376\n00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.850\nRemember, we've talked about Styles\nin Word are same idea, collected\n\n377\n00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:30.060\ngroup of formatting that's under one\nname that you can apply multiple places.\n\n378\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.400\nSo you see I have Heading 1,\nit's showing me up here and Heading 2.\n\n379\n00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.790\nAnd while I love to teach Word,\nI'm gonna try to stop right there, but\n\n380\n00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:42.270\nI wanted to at least point it out because\nwhen you place text in Illustrator,\n\n381\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.070\nit will retain the styles as well.\n\n382\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.690\nBut again, not very well.\n\n383\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.060\nAnd this right here,\nwe see that this is Arial, isn't it?\n\n384\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.290\nIt won't be Arial when we put\nit into Illustrator [LAUGH].\n\n385\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.700\nOkay, so right here.\n\n386\n00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.444\nI'm gonna go to File and\nI'm gonna go to Place, okay?\n\n387\n00:19:58.444 --> 00:20:03.290\nSo when I'm placing this and\nI'm gonna find the text in Word,\n\n388\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.590\nMac because I was doing some\ntrials with Mac versus PC.\n\n389\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:13.350\nIt does give me this Import Options like\nhey, do you want to bring in everything?\n\n390\n00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.530\nOkay, and yes, I could if I wanted to.\n\n391\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.490\nYou could also remove the text\nif you really wanted to but\n\n392\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.295\nI'm not going to do\nthat because I want to.\n\n393\n00:20:21.295 --> 00:20:22.900\nSo if I click OK,\n\n394\n00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.530\nI'm going to show you that it's got all\nof this text loaded up ready to go.\n\n395\n00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:32.080\nJust like when we do our images where\nit's gonna show you the previews for\n\n396\n00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.140\nthe images.\n\n397\n00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.580\nAnd if I click, hold, and drag, make\na big old text frame, it goes ahead and\n\n398\n00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.170\nbrings it in.\n\n399\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.330\nAnd it looks like it does in Word.\n\n400\n00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.060\n>> It looks exactly the same, yeah.\n\n401\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:43.560\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n402\n00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.630\nIt brought in my text and\nit brought in my colors.\n\n403\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:53.591\nAnd if I go over to my character panel,\nokay, I can go into, so my styles, sorry.\n\n404\n00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:56.983\nIt brought in the Heading 1, the Heading\n2, the [INAUDIBLE], the title and\n\n405\n00:20:56.983 --> 00:20:58.050\neverything like that.\n\n406\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.487\n>> It does look like it brought in\nHeading 1, I see the blue color there but\n\n407\n00:21:01.487 --> 00:21:03.105\nthe size doesn't look the same.\n\n408\n00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:06.523\nAnd I know you had a larger, at the very\ntop of your document, above the red text,\n\n409\n00:21:06.523 --> 00:21:08.210\nthat was a little larger as well.\n\n410\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.920\n>> Yeah.\n\n411\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.640\nThis is that weird thing that when\nyou place it, it doesn't really work.\n\n412\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.640\n>> So it brings in part of the style but\nnot the entire style.\n\n413\n00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.390\n>> Yeah, and\n\n414\n00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:18.420\nsometimes it works better than others but\nit's just one of those things, so.\n\n415\n00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.139\n>> Just gotta try it and see.\n\n416\n00:21:19.139 --> 00:21:20.700\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's still better than\n\n417\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.110\nstarting from scratch, I mean you've\ngot the bulk of the data in there,\n\n418\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.770\nyour text and some of the styles.\n\n419\n00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.040\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which is good.\n\n420\n00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.314\n>> I would normally probably just remove\neverything and just format it myself,\n\n421\n00:21:31.314 --> 00:21:35.716\nbecause I'm also wanting it to look very\ndifferent most of the time than I want it\n\n422\n00:21:35.716 --> 00:21:37.245\nto look like in a Word file.\n\n423\n00:21:37.245 --> 00:21:40.620\nThan something that I'm going to be\ndoing for branding of a company or\n\n424\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.736\nsomething like that.\n\n425\n00:21:41.736 --> 00:21:44.440\n>> Typically your source file doesn't have\nthe right formatting you want anyway,\n\n426\n00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.830\nso you don't care if it strips it all out.\n\n427\n00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.530\n>> Pretty much, yeah.\n\n428\n00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.760\n>> Gotcha.\n>> So, but if you need it, it's there.\n\n429\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.780\nAnd like I said,\nInDesign's a lot better at it.\n\n430\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.830\nBut right here I can show you\nthat if I go over to here,\n\n431\n00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.710\nit's showing that it's Myriad.\n\n432\n00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.360\nThat's not Arial, okay?\n\n433\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.770\nAnd yeah, the font is different.\n\n434\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.160\nAnd that's because, remember what\nwe talked about with the styles,\n\n435\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.570\nremember that red, the plus sign.\n\n436\n00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Means there's overrides, okay.\n\n437\n00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.070\nSomething is making it's\noverriding the initial,\n\n438\n00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:14.190\nthe real style underneath it, if you want\nto say, to have it not really show it.\n\n439\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.470\nAnd even if I take this and I do\nthe Alt+Click to remove the overrides,\n\n440\n00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.055\nit's still showing Myriad, which I\nnever had Myriad in Word to begin with.\n\n441\n00:22:22.055 --> 00:22:25.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, at least it's trying.\n\n442\n00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.138\n>> It is.\n\n443\n00:22:26.138 --> 00:22:29.815\n>> So, it's doing its best but-\n>> A for effort.\n\n444\n00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:31.580\n>> [LAUGH] Definitely A for effort,\n\n445\n00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.150\nbut at least I can come into here and\njust reformat.\n\n446\n00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:39.310\nI could even go ahead and\nuse the normal paragraph style\n\n447\n00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.270\nin Illustrator to go ahead and\nget rid of everything.\n\n448\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.015\nThat's usually what I'll do,\nbring it in and take it out,\n\n449\n00:22:45.015 --> 00:22:47.905\nand then try to fix it up.\n\n450\n00:22:47.905 --> 00:22:52.175\nIt does bring in the color,\nI wanted to point out that as well.\n\n451\n00:22:52.175 --> 00:22:56.760\nBecause that's something you should know,\nkind of going back to that test\n\n452\n00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.253\nquestion of how it's treated,\nis that those swatches,\n\n453\n00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:04.790\nyou can see that these are the colors\nthat are coming in from the Word file.\n\n454\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.040\nAnd you can see they're coming\nin as global colors, okay.\n\n455\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.730\nNow, these aren't all the colors that\nwere used in the document but it's just\n\n456\n00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:18.640\npart of what Word remembers as the color\ntheme, and all that fun stuff that works.\n\n457\n00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.205\n>> Exactly, that palette that\ngoes with that particular style.\n\n458\n00:23:21.205 --> 00:23:21.770\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n459\n00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.390\nAnd so it's bringing it in,\nand they're global swatches.\n\n460\n00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.760\nSo again,\nyou could use it if you wanted to,\n\n461\n00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.970\nto say let's change up the, all the colors\nthat were blue, let's go ahead and\n\n462\n00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.630\nuse that, but\nI'm probably not gonna do that.\n\n463\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.340\nSo, I would probably take it all out and\nredo it for myself, so.\n\n464\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.300\nAll right?\n\n465\n00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.930\nAnd that's how you can add\nsome text in your document.\n\n466\n00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.560\n>> Fantastic stuff, fun.\n\n467\n00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.115\nGreat look at how we can get that text\ninto our document, whether we're just\n\n468\n00:23:49.115 --> 00:23:53.405\nstarting with nothing and typing it\nin with a point type or an area type.\n\n469\n00:23:53.405 --> 00:23:58.640\nOr for cutting and pasting or copying,\npasting, or placing that text.\n\n470\n00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.290\nAnd then

00:00:20.108\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:24.766\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be looking at type on a path and\n\n5\n00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.900\ntext wrap.\n\n6\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.858\nNow we've already looked at some ways we\ncan insert text into our documents that\n\n7\n00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:30.815\nwe're creating.\n\n8\n00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:34.159\nAnd do formatting both at\nthe character and the paragraph level.\n\n9\n00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.400\nNow we're gonna take adding\ntext to the next level.\n\n10\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.420\nAnd have a little fun with it.\n\n11\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.280\nAnd here to help us with that is Ms.\nVaughan Smith.\n\n12\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.050\nHow are you doing, Vaughan?\n\n13\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.450\n>> Great, ready to rock and\nroll on some paths today.\n\n14\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.560\nAnd go up and down, and all which ways.\n\n15\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.361\nSo\n>> Absolutely.\n\n16\n00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:52.493\n>> Yes, it's gonna be lot of fun and\nI put two concepts together that\n\n17\n00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:58.290\nnot necessarily really go together,\nbut they kinda do, but not really.\n\n18\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.243\nSo [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:59.243 --> 00:01:01.289\n>> We're gonna talk about how we can put\n\n20\n00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.467\ntext on a pattern,\nhow it almost wraps around that path.\n\n21\n00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:09.430\nAnd then, we're gonna talk about how we\ncan take text and wrap it around objects.\n\n22\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.308\n>> So, kinda close.\n\n23\n00:01:11.308 --> 00:01:13.853\nWe'll see.\n>> Yeah, well, they have some similar\n\n24\n00:01:13.853 --> 00:01:18.087\nwords, [LAUGH] but they are all part\nof having more fun with text and so\n\n25\n00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:20.555\nthat's what we're going to do today.\n\n26\n00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:23.915\nSo let's just go ahead and jump in and\n\n27\n00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:29.305\nget going because I have a segment that\nI have some paths already created.\n\n28\n00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:33.780\nWe learned how to use the pen tool and\nmake our cute little S curve.\n\n29\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.435\nThis is just the line,\nthis is just a circle.\n\n30\n00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:40.065\nSo we're going to add text around them or\n\n31\n00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:44.020\non them because maybe we don't\nwant to just go straight across.\n\n32\n00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.620\nWe want to follow a path and\nthat's what type on a path means, but\n\n33\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.490\nbefore we get in to showing you exactly\nhow to do that I do wanna take this moment\n\n34\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.110\nto really point out the mouse\ncursor icons because\n\n35\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.920\nthis is where it is really\nimportant to watch for that.\n\n36\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.130\nWe saw how we could add text.\n\n37\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.560\nWe just click and type.\n\n38\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.870\nAnd that has the little box around it.\n\n39\n00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.730\nAnd maybe I didn't point\nit out as clearly.\n\n40\n00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.380\nBut here is where you're really\ngoing to really need it.\n\n41\n00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.130\nSo I'm gonna go over here to the T tool.\n\n42\n00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.820\nAnd right here, you can see that\nmy mouse cursor icon looks like\n\n43\n00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.260\na box with I beam in it.\n\n44\n00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.540\nSo there's a dotted box\naround the mouse cursor.\n\n45\n00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.220\nThat indicates to you that\nyou are creating new text.\n\n46\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.660\nThat's the whole click and type or click,\nhold and drag and make a text box and\n\n47\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.820\nyou can add text.\n\n48\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.220\nThat's great.\n\n49\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.310\nWell when you're doing type on a path,\nif you're using type on a path or\n\n50\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.790\nyou're actually using an open path and\nwanting to add type to it,\n\n51\n00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.510\nyou're gonna get this icon,\n\n52\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.880\nand you see how it actually looks like an\nI-beam with like a little dotted swoopy?\n\n53\n00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.603\nThat's a technical term there.\n\n54\n00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:50.039\n>> Swoopy, I like that.\n\n55\n00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:54.240\n>> [LAUGH] So you have the swoopy on the\nI-beam versus the box around the I-beam.\n\n56\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.470\nSo those are two big indications to you\nthat you're either adding regular type or\n\n57\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.280\nit's saying that I found a path\nthat I'm gonna attach myself to.\n\n58\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.550\nSo big indications of\nwhat you're doing here.\n\n59\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.300\nNow that mouse cursor icon will\nbe the swoopy, the swoopy [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.220\nI-beam will only be when you're adding,\nor you're around open paths.\n\n61\n00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.480\nFor example this, there's this circle,\nthis is a closed path, right?\n\n62\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.884\nIf I get into here, I can come anywhere\nnear the edge of the circle, and\n\n63\n00:03:23.884 --> 00:03:27.620\nit's not gonna give me the same\nmouse cursor icon as this guy does.\n\n64\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.060\nThat's because it doesn't find the end.\n\n65\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.760\nSo it actually goes with\ndifferent mouse cursor icon.\n\n66\n00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.710\nIt goes to the I-beam with a circle around\nit, and when you have a circle around\n\n67\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.960\nthe I-beam, it's going to be adding text\ninside of that path, almost like a frame.\n\n68\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.436\nIt's saying I found a frame for\nme to put text inside of.\n\n69\n00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:51.819\nSo, again, very slight but\n\n70\n00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.115\nit makes a huge difference as to\nwhere your text is going to be added.\n\n71\n00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:57.147\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Okay, there's one more and\n\n72\n00:03:57.147 --> 00:04:00.480\nthat's where if your over text\nthat is already existing.\n\n73\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.350\nLike right here, I have some text.\n\n74\n00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.830\nIf I put my mouse cursor over it,\n\n75\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.820\ntrying to get a point where you can\nprobably see it, it's there's no box.\n\n76\n00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.170\nIf there's no box, it means it's\nfinding text that it sees, and\n\n77\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.030\nif you click, it's gonna just go\ninto the text that's already there.\n\n78\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.598\nAnd I actually made some little notes over\nhere just in case you all wanted to have\n\n79\n00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:21.260\nit and then so you can have this file.\n\n80\n00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.087\nBut it just shows the different cursors\nand what you can do, and it also kind of\n\n81\n00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:30.710\ngives you the option of the open path and\nclose paths and so on and so forth.\n\n82\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.875\nBecause I am showing you\non the text that the oops,\n\n83\n00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:34.588\nthat's the wrong files covered here.\n\n84\n00:04:34.588 --> 00:04:39.980\n[LAUGH] The first example that I'm\ngonna show you is with an open path.\n\n85\n00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.620\nI am just using the regular old type tool.\n\n86\n00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.790\nBut there is a type on a path tool.\n\n87\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.250\nSo you could use that tool, if you're\nlike, I know exactly what I'm going to do.\n\n88\n00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.030\nBut again, I just really\nwanted to drive home the point\n\n89\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.468\nabout the mouse cursor icons with\nthe regular text tool, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.608\nOr type text, there we go.\n\n91\n00:05:00.608 --> 00:05:04.810\nAll right, so we've made a path and\nwe want the text to go along it.\n\n92\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.300\nI'm finding my mouse cursor that\ngives me a little swoopy, okay,\n\n93\n00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.990\nstaying consistent with my terminology.\n\n94\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.390\nAnd all you gotta do is\njust click on to that path.\n\n95\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.060\nYou’re saying I want to attach yourself.\n\n96\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.340\nSo I click and two things happen.\n\n97\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.540\nThe flashing mouse cursor\ngoes on that path and\n\n98\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.910\nthe formatting of your\npath goes away by default.\n\n99\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.960\nThat will always happen.\n\n100\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.350\nSo you could have a fill in a stroke.\n\n101\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.810\nIt will always go to, no fill, no stroke.\n\n102\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.647\nYou can change that afterwards but\nwe'll get to that, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:32.647 --> 00:05:38.451\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and type,\nwe're gonna say and type on a path.\n\n104\n00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:43.121\nYay, all right, so I've got that there,\nand now I can go ahead and\n\n105\n00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:48.294\nselect the text just like I would if I\nwanted to, or I can go back to the black\n\n106\n00:05:48.294 --> 00:05:53.170\narrow to unselect the entire text\nbox which is on this text frame.\n\n107\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.160\nAnd you can format everything.\n\n108\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.700\nI'm just gonna make this text bigger so\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n109\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.310\nSo there we go,\nmaybe bump it up just a little bit.\n\n110\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.000\nAnd you can see here's\nthis type on a path.\n\n111\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.960\nSo same formatting.\n\n112\n00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.760\nYou can change the color.\n\n113\n00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.710\nDo whatever you want with it.\n\n114\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.790\nThat's fine.\n\n115\n00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.280\nBut this is where if I wanted to,\nI like the text but\n\n116\n00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.090\nI wanted to kinda go down\nthe hill a little bit, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.264\nAnd this is what I call you're gonna\npush the train down the tracks.\n\n118\n00:06:15.264 --> 00:06:17.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz that's what it kinda just\n\n119\n00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.201\nreminds me of.\n\n120\n00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:21.516\nAnd this is another place where\nyou do need to be careful and\n\n121\n00:06:21.516 --> 00:06:24.506\nwatch what does your mouse\ncursor look like, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:24.506 --> 00:06:27.410\nAnd you have to be doing this\nwith a black arrow tool.\n\n123\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.080\nYou don't do this with the T tool, right?\n\n124\n00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.960\nSo, let me just show you, T tool is not\ngoing to give you the same mouse cursor\n\n125\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.850\nicons that I'm wanting to show to\npush the train down the tracks.\n\n126\n00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.270\nThat's the black arrow tool.\n\n127\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.390\nThat's another kind of misconception\nthat a lot of people fall into.\n\n128\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.560\nIt's like, we'll type.\n\n129\n00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.050\n>> It looks like with your text tool,\nit actually turn back into the I-beam with\n\n130\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.310\nno frame cuz it sees text and it's like\nyou're gonna add text to existing text.\n\n131\n00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.150\n>> Exactly, yes.\n\n132\n00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.780\nAnd in this plan,\n\n133\n00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.290\nwe want to move the text on the paths,\nmove the train down the tracks.\n\n134\n00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.687\nSo black arrow tool.\n\n135\n00:06:57.687 --> 00:07:02.551\nOkay, so here you can see that you've\ngot this little guy right here.\n\n136\n00:07:02.551 --> 00:07:04.880\nIt's like a line with a little box on it.\n\n137\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.050\nThis is indicating to you, this is where\nthe train tracks start if you wanna say.\n\n138\n00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.600\nThis is like the beginning of the train,\nokay?\n\n139\n00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.426\nThe text is a train.\n\n140\n00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:15.315\n[LAUGH] And\n\n141\n00:07:15.315 --> 00:07:19.720\nthen you have the track which is the path\nand then you have the end of the track.\n\n142\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.460\nOkay, and that's again right there.\n\n143\n00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.620\nSo you see it's got\na line with a box there.\n\n144\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.700\nNotice how my mouse cursor icons are going\nto look very different when I hover\n\n145\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.160\nover it right there versus right there.\n\n146\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.578\nWhat I'm trying to get to\nis a [LAUGH] there it is,\n\n147\n00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:38.534\nit's a top of an arrow with no tail,\nwith an arrow pointing that way,\n\n148\n00:07:38.534 --> 00:07:42.912\nokay, or whichever way,\nthe other way of the track, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:47.826\nFirst if I come over here, my mouse cursor\nis going to look like the missing tail\n\n150\n00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:51.632\nwith the arrow going that way,\nokay, so it's very slight.\n\n151\n00:07:51.632 --> 00:07:54.592\n>> It's getting the direction that\nthe track goes from that point?\n\n152\n00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:55.416\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n153\n00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:57.494\n>> Like this is the start of the track and\nthe other one is the end of the track.\n\n154\n00:07:57.494 --> 00:07:59.573\nSo the only way you can\ngo is pick up the track.\n\n155\n00:07:59.573 --> 00:08:02.303\nAnd then there is one little\nguy in the middle, and\n\n156\n00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.717\nthat's where he looks a little different.\n\n157\n00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:06.729\nAnd I can't set, there it is, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:07.535\nSee right there?\n\n159\n00:08:07.535 --> 00:08:10.105\nIt's little harder to\nshow on this open path.\n\n160\n00:08:10.105 --> 00:08:13.050\nWhen we get into the closed path,\nit's much more pronounced.\n\n161\n00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.610\nIt's like an upside-down T and\nthat indicates the middle.\n\n162\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.900\nAnd if you hover over it, you get\nthe arrow pointing up underneath your\n\n163\n00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.270\narrow with the missing tail, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.440\nMake sure you just look, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.960\nAlways watch cuz they\nall do different things.\n\n166\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.750\nLet's start with the front of the track.\n\n167\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.460\nI wanna push the train down the track.\n\n168\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.148\nWhen you have the mouse icon you\njust click, hold and just [SOUND],\n\n169\n00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:38.368\nyou can choo, choo.\n\n170\n00:08:38.368 --> 00:08:39.599\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm sorry.\n\n171\n00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:40.806\nI had to.\n\n172\n00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:42.140\n[LAUGH] Had to make the sound effect.\n\n173\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.722\nSo we're pushing the train down\nthe track and it goes on like that.\n\n174\n00:08:46.722 --> 00:08:48.820\nYou wanna pull it back, you pull it back.\n\n175\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.212\nThat's-\n>> Very cool\n\n176\n00:08:51.212 --> 00:08:51.991\n>> Pushing the train down the track.\n\n177\n00:08:51.991 --> 00:08:52.743\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n178\n00:08:52.743 --> 00:08:56.470\nit also moves the beginning point\nof that track, if you will, too.\n\n179\n00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.381\nWhen you pushed it,\nit didn't just move the text.\n\n180\n00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:59.738\nThat little box with the line\nthrough it moved as well.\n\n181\n00:08:59.738 --> 00:09:01.406\n>> Mm-hm.\nI guess we'll say the beginning\n\n182\n00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:03.380\nof the train,\nbecause were talking about the track.\n\n183\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.910\nThe track goes all the way back here,\nright,\n\n184\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.410\nso I could pull the train to the beginning\nof the track if I really wanted to.\n\n185\n00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.562\n>> Okay.\n>> Now we're starting to kind of mix our\n\n186\n00:09:10.562 --> 00:09:11.302\nmetaphors, aren't we?\n\n187\n00:09:11.302 --> 00:09:12.323\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:14.105\n>> But I think you guys get the idea,\n\n189\n00:09:14.105 --> 00:09:16.000\nis you kind of push it along.\n\n190\n00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.920\nAnd the end of the track,\nif I get too close to the end, you see,\n\n191\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.420\nif I push like this, you see it's gonna\nstart to say, well, I have shortened\n\n192\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.900\nthe amount of space that the train can\nlive on and you get that red plus sign.\n\n193\n00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.650\nNow, the red plus sign means\nthat there is overset text and\n\n194\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.670\nthere's more that's trying to show.\n\n195\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.860\nIf you really wanted to, you could pick\nthat up and flow it onto another path.\n\n196\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.570\nThat, to me, I've actually never done\na project where I had to do that.\n\n197\n00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.660\nBut you could theoretically pick it up and\nput it on another path.\n\n198\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.350\nBut for here, I would just go ahead and\n\n199\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:52.890\njust extend the area of the track that the\ntrain can live on and that's how it goes.\n\n200\n00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.310\nAnd that's basically how you can\nmove the text along the path.\n\n201\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.770\nAnd that one other icon that I showed you,\nit will flip it, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.240\nSo here if I take this,\nyou see how I can turn it upside down?\n\n203\n00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.480\nThat's the mouse icon in the middle\nthat has the arrow pointing up.\n\n204\n00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.070\nIt flips it, okay?\n\n205\n00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:15.007\nSo I can kind of,\nyou can move it there too but you gotta be\n\n206\n00:10:15.007 --> 00:10:18.930\ncareful cuz if you if you go too far down,\nit just flips it on the track.\n\n207\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.650\nSo, you could grab it from the middle.\n\n208\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.830\nYou could grab it from the beginning, and\nmove it around, and that's how it goes.\n\n209\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.140\nSo that's moving the text\nthat's on the path.\n\n210\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.550\nBut this is a path still.\n\n211\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.275\nAnd remember that you can modify the path.\n\n212\n00:10:34.275 --> 00:10:36.140\nCuz maybe I don't want\nit to curve as much.\n\n213\n00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.380\nOr I want a deeper curve.\n\n214\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.590\nYou can modify the path, and\nthat's going back to the white arrow tool.\n\n215\n00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.499\nRemember the points on the path and\nall that?\n\n216\n00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:48.595\nSo if I go here, I can take and\nget the white arrow tool, I can click\n\n217\n00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:54.940\non individual anchor points on that path\nand then I can modify the path itself.\n\n218\n00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.410\nAnd the text will of course\ntravel along with that path and\n\n219\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.660\nI can maybe kind of twirl it this way.\n\n220\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.792\nOr whichever way I want.\n\n221\n00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.590\nSo, you can still modify.\n\n222\n00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.400\nYou can add points, delete points, convert\npoints, all the things that you can do\n\n223\n00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.680\nwith modifying a path with the white\narrow tool and any of the pen tools.\n\n224\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.910\nAll applied here.\n\n225\n00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.428\nAnd so that's what you can do.\n\n226\n00:11:14.428 --> 00:11:15.450\n>> Very neat.\n>> Very neat.\n\n227\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.400\nAnd talking back about the formatting\ngoes away on your path.\n\n228\n00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.180\nWell, since I have activated the path,\nI can go and change and\n\n229\n00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.940\nadd a stroke to that,\nlike I really wanted that black line.\n\n230\n00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.260\nI didn't want the formatting\nof that path to go away.\n\n231\n00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.910\nYou can add it back on, as long as you\nget the white arrow tool, set the path.\n\n232\n00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.980\nNow you don't have the quick access\non the tool options bar, but\n\n233\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.910\nyou can go over to your Swatches, and\nyour Swatches, knowing that the fill and\n\n234\n00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.750\nthe stroke of which ones on\ntop of what you can apply.\n\n235\n00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.460\nIf I put the stroke box on top and\nthen use my black, you see there's where\n\n236\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.710\nI can go ahead and add the black\nformatting back to the stroke.\n\n237\n00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.550\nI can still go ahead and\nformat the stroke.\n\n238\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.030\nYou just have to go and\nformat in different places.\n\n239\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.860\nI'm usually going up to the tool Options\nbar cuz I have something selected and\n\n240\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.180\nI want to format it that way.\n\n241\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.760\nJust always remember there's always other\nways in the panels that you can go to.\n\n242\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.440\nSo you just have kinda go back\nover to that side to format it.\n\n243\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.080\n>> Very cool.\n\n244\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.680\nSo normally the path though will disappear\nwhen you remove that formatting and\n\n245\n00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.730\nyou go to, say, print this,\nthat path will disappear altogether.\n\n246\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.010\n>> Yes, if you just left alone,\nit would never show.\n\n247\n00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.230\nLike I'm showing it here.\n\n248\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.764\nHere let me-\n>> Because it's selected.\n\n249\n00:12:24.764 --> 00:12:27.555\n>> Yeah, and we'll back up and\ntake off the formatting, so\n\n250\n00:12:27.555 --> 00:12:31.530\nif I click off into here it just looks\nlike it's just floating, if you wanna say.\n\n251\n00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.287\nSo yeah, when you're saying printing-\n>> Yeah.\n\n252\n00:12:33.287 --> 00:12:33.994\n>> It's not visible.\n\n253\n00:12:33.994 --> 00:12:34.692\n>> Correct.\n\n254\n00:12:34.692 --> 00:12:35.748\n>> How about that.\n\n255\n00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:36.909\n[LAUGH]\n>> Very cool.\n\n256\n00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:37.513\n>> Great.\n\n257\n00:12:37.513 --> 00:12:39.630\nNow I'm gonna go back to what I did.\n\n258\n00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.790\nI'm just using my hotkeys to do redos and\nundos.\n\n259\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.601\nI like it but\nit's sitting right on the path, right?\n\n260\n00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.762\nIt's too close.\n\n261\n00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:53.410\nI want it to follow that path but\nI want it to kind of raise up.\n\n262\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.820\nThere's a couple ways you could do this.\n\n263\n00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:01.800\nOne way is you can go into the Type On\na Path options within the Type menu.\n\n264\n00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.720\nSo I have the thing I want to format.\n\n265\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.230\nI have it selected, select to effect,\nand I have my black arrow tool.\n\n266\n00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.948\nAnd I go to the Type menu, and I go to\nType On a Path, and you can see there,\n\n267\n00:13:11.948 --> 00:13:16.850\nthere are these default options, and\nthen there's the whole dialogue box.\n\n268\n00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.000\nSo, I'm gonna go here so\nyou can see everything.\n\n269\n00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.156\nSo, on this, you can see what is the text\naligning itself to on the path and\n\n270\n00:13:25.156 --> 00:13:28.030\nyou can see you can do a, whoops, sorry.\n\n271\n00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.630\nTurn on my preview so you can see this.\n\n272\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.840\nSo you can see ascender, or\nI can do descenders, or I can do center,\n\n273\n00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.840\nso you can see there's different ways of\ndefault formatting, like left, right,\n\n274\n00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.160\ncenter type stuff.\n\n275\n00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.900\nAnd then you can also change the spacing,\nthat went a little crazy, okay, so\n\n276\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.090\nmaybe I'll go back to auto.\n\n277\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:50.300\n[LAUGH] But you can adjust the tracking,\nbasically, through the spacing.\n\n278\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.630\nAnd then, the different ways\nthat you can do rainbow effects,\n\n279\n00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.290\nI've kind of messed this up,\nso why don't we do this?\n\n280\n00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.138\nLet's cancel this.\n\n281\n00:13:55.138 --> 00:13:55.948\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n282\n00:13:55.948 --> 00:13:58.546\n>> And let's go back to those options, so\n\n283\n00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.787\nI can show because the spacing\ngot way too crazy.\n\n284\n00:14:01.787 --> 00:14:06.803\nBut the effects of how it actually sits on\nthe path, is you could do, so this is kind\n\n285\n00:14:06.803 --> 00:14:11.747\nof fun, see how it actually kind of turns\nthe letters if you wanna say on the path,\n\n286\n00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:16.018\nthe 3D ribbon can get really crazy,\nwe do some really weird shapes.\n\n287\n00:14:16.018 --> 00:14:18.770\nAnd see how it stays up,\nthe stair stepping?\n\n288\n00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.629\nSo you can just go through the effects\nand, okay that might be a little weird.\n\n289\n00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:23.480\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n290\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.130\n>> So that's one way you can do it,\n\n291\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:30.120\nis changing these default options or\nchanging the spacing of the letters on\n\n292\n00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.160\nthe Type On the Path options,\nwhich can be fun.\n\n293\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:40.170\nBut I wanna control how much space\nthat text is going off the path.\n\n294\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.030\nSo that's where I go to my baseline shift.\n\n295\n00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.106\nNow baseline shift is\na character level formatting, so\n\n296\n00:14:47.106 --> 00:14:50.181\nif I go to my character panel and\nI show the options here,\n\n297\n00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:53.610\nthe baseline shift is the a with\na little a right there?\n\n298\n00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:57.740\nAnd so if I just start\nincreasing the baseline shift\n\n299\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.980\nto be a positive baseline shift,\nit's going to go up on the path.\n\n300\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.090\nAnd then of course you can\nadjust your tracking here.\n\n301\n00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.590\nDo you want it spaced out more?\n\n302\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.591\nAnd of course, it is gonna change how\nthe spacing is because the path is,\n\n303\n00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:15.917\nif you've got like a real quick dip in\na path it will create like, see how the a,\n\n304\n00:15:15.917 --> 00:15:20.403\nand the o, and the n look like they're\nreally spaced out, versus the y and the p?\n\n305\n00:15:20.403 --> 00:15:23.712\nThat's just because of the way\nit's curving along that path.\n\n306\n00:15:23.712 --> 00:15:27.137\nSo, sometimes just adjusting\nthe path will help the spacing.\n\n307\n00:15:27.137 --> 00:15:31.572\nBut I like to have more of a control with\nthe baseline shift, and the tracking, and\n\n308\n00:15:31.572 --> 00:15:36.072\nthe kerning, if I wanted to go in-between\ntwo characters with how it actually sets\n\n309\n00:15:36.072 --> 00:15:37.250\non the path.\n\n310\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.280\nAnd that is how you can\nadd type on an open path.\n\n311\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.720\n>> Very cool.\nNow we can get really\n\n312\n00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.030\ncreative when we start adding\ntext to our documents.\n\n313\n00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.770\n>> Exactly.\n\n314\n00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:46.680\nYes, it's a lot of fun.\n\n315\n00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.270\nWhether you want the path to show or\nnot show.\n\n316\n00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.415\nOr print if you are saying.\n\n317\n00:15:50.415 --> 00:15:54.971\n[LAUGH] I just wanted to give you two\nquick other examples with this closed path\n\n318\n00:15:54.971 --> 00:15:55.762\nright here.\n\n319\n00:15:55.762 --> 00:16:00.445\nCuz I wanted to demonstrate\nwhat I call the shower handle.\n\n320\n00:16:00.445 --> 00:16:03.336\nAnd we have the front of the train,\nand the tracks and\n\n321\n00:16:03.336 --> 00:16:06.902\nall those weird things that I This\nis just what I see, honestly.\n\n322\n00:16:06.902 --> 00:16:07.645\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n323\n00:16:07.645 --> 00:16:10.530\n>> So I'm gonna go back to the T tool now.\n\n324\n00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.170\nAgain, since this is a closed path,\n\n325\n00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.150\nI can't get that swoopy I-beam\nthat I was talking about.\n\n326\n00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.640\nSo, I am gonna go to the actual\ntype on a path tool.\n\n327\n00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.800\nSo I'm saying yes this is the tool I want,\nthis is the path I want it does find it.\n\n328\n00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.360\nAnd if I click you see\nthere I have some text.\n\n329\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.635\nText type, type text type on A path, okay?\n\n330\n00:16:34.635 --> 00:16:37.125\nNow it's keeping the last\ncharacter formattings that I had.\n\n331\n00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:40.995\nThat's why it's automatically\ngoing like above that path.\n\n332\n00:16:40.995 --> 00:16:42.805\nYou know how it's a little spaced out?\n\n333\n00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:45.590\nBecause it kept my last\nformatting that I was on?\n\n334\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.645\nJust pointing that out.\n\n335\n00:16:46.645 --> 00:16:47.370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n336\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:52.200\n>> Now if closed paths, if you think\nabout it, the track is circular.\n\n337\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.905\n>> There is no beginning or end.\n\n338\n00:16:53.905 --> 00:16:56.320\n>> Mm-hm, so you can still use that.\n\n339\n00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.320\nYou can still use the beginning of\nthe track and then push the train and\n\n340\n00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.960\nthat's It's fine, but\nin this one you can see right here.\n\n341\n00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.440\nThis is, I call it the shower\nhandle cuz there's the shower and\n\n342\n00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.895\nthere's the handles that go like this?\n\n343\n00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:10.458\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> That's just what I remember.\n\n344\n00:17:10.458 --> 00:17:12.620\n[LAUGH] So that's what I think of.\n\n345\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.375\nAll right?\n\n346\n00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:14.550\nSo you could take this and\n\n347\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:20.390\nyou could kinda move it along the path\ncircular, all of being circular.\n\n348\n00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.790\nAll right, so\nyou can kinda do it that way but it does,\n\n349\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.180\nI will say it will get a little, see like\nI'm already freaking out a little bit.\n\n350\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.480\nSlow movement Events.\n\n351\n00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.570\nNow, just take-\n>> Because, again,\n\n352\n00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:29.570\nyou're moving that middle one.\n\n353\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.180\nAnd just like with type on\na path in the open path,\n\n354\n00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.740\nif you went below the line it would\nflip to the other side of the path.\n\n355\n00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.885\nSo it's kinda doing the same thing?\n\n356\n00:17:35.885 --> 00:17:36.450\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n357\n00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.590\nAnd it's a little more temperamental\nbecause you're just kind of\n\n358\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.460\nwait, stop, stop.\n\n359\n00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.170\nThat's when I say, like, just stop.\n\n360\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.220\nLet go.\n\n361\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.990\nIf you need to, undo and start over.\n\n362\n00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:51.110\nSo you can kind of just,\nI wanna really get it just like that and\n\n363\n00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.670\nget it right on the centre and\nso on and so forth.\n\n364\n00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.330\nNow you could do it to where it doesn't\nflip if you hold your shift key,\n\n365\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.560\nthis little thing.\n\n366\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.800\nWell, it's not working right now.\n\n367\n00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.280\nBut you can hold the shift and\nit won't flip in.\n\n368\n00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.030\nI forgot to hold it before.\n\n369\n00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.550\nBut you can do that and\nit will stop flipping.\n\n370\n00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.990\nAnd that's where you can\ntake that shower handle and\n\n371\n00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.140\nget that type on a path right there.\n\n372\n00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.700\nNow, I did three circles\npurposefully because you cannot\n\n373\n00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:23.690\nadd different formats of type\non one path differently.\n\n374\n00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:28.090\nI don't know if I'm explaining that very\nwell but you know like drink coasters or\n\n375\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.650\ncircular stickers you can see\ntext that goes across here and\n\n376\n00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.250\ntext that goes across there.\n\n377\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:38.840\nThat's the example I'm trying to get I-\n>> So if one closed path,\n\n378\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.100\nthe formatting is gonna be the same for\nall text on that closed path.\n\n379\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.960\n>> Yes, and especially if you want one\nto go this way and one to go that way,\n\n380\n00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.670\nyou have to have two separate paths.\n\n381\n00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.590\nSo that's why I just duplicated\nthe same path twice.\n\n382\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.200\nOr actually three times.\n\n383\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.120\nSo, that way if I take this one,\n\n384\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.520\nbecause I have the type on the path from\nthe top come over to the path tool here,\n\n385\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.360\ntype in I'll just type in my name,\nsince I can't think of anything else.\n\n386\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.930\nSo, I take this now it's all right\nwell I want this to go the underside.\n\n387\n00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.090\nThis is where I do flip it.\n\n388\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.240\nTurn it upside down so it's like okay,\n\n389\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.850\nthat's about the middle of\nthe bottom of the path.\n\n390\n00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.360\nBut now I don't want the text\nto sit on the top of the path,\n\n391\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.760\nI want it to sit below so\nnow you just do a negative baseline shift.\n\n392\n00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.980\nPositive goes up, negative goes down.\n\n393\n00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.930\nSo then I can just kind of\nkeep on pushing it down.\n\n394\n00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.690\nNow it does space out a little bit more.\n\n395\n00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:34.370\nSo then I'll go ahead and put like maybe\na little bit of negative tracking on that.\n\n396\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.320\nYou're gonna play around with this so\nI don't wanna sit here and\n\n397\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.360\nget super picky cuz I will.\n\n398\n00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.140\nAlso I can, ops it's already freaking\nout a little bit so it stops.\n\n399\n00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.760\n>> Can you bring that up on\nthe up a little bit more Swan C.\n\n400\n00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.822\n>> Yeah, good thank you.\n\n401\n00:19:46.822 --> 00:19:51.830\n[LAUGH] So I can do that okay there\nis my shower handle, actually there\n\n402\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.620\nis my shower handle so I can go ahead and\ndo that Kind of put it right there,\n\n403\n00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.950\nand now you can see that now since\nthese two circles were the same size,\n\n404\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.660\nI can take this,\nuse my align panel to go ahead.\n\n405\n00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.260\nI think I was aligned to the art board,\ncuz I was doing a project before.\n\n406\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.380\nSo I just do center center,\nso align this way,\n\n407\n00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.680\nalign that way, I have what looks like.\n\n408\n00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.640\nType on a path this way,\ntype on a path that way, but\n\n409\n00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.470\nit's actually two separate paths.\n\n410\n00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.250\nAnd then you can actually take all these\nguys together cuz this is the ones that I\n\n411\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.400\nhave formatted.\n\n412\n00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.790\nAnd then you have\nthe beginnings of a circle.\n\n413\n00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.660\nSticker or\n\n414\n00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.450\na coaster or any type of logo that you\nneed text here and you need text there.\n\n415\n00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.030\n>> That's pretty clever.\n\n416\n00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:32.640\nI like that.\n\n417\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.730\n>> It is pretty fun.\n\n418\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.950\nAnd the only reason why I added this\nwas just to demonstrate what I showed\n\n419\n00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.810\nyou guys before.\n\n420\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.010\nWell I could go ahead and add hello.\n\n421\n00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.160\nStill my formating.\n\n422\n00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.390\nSo, maybe let's go ahead and\n\n423\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:49.080\ntake this back to zero and\ntake that back to zero really quickly.\n\n424\n00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.160\nAnd bump this up so we can see it.\n\n425\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.260\nAnd this was just a, when you have a\nstraight path that's where you can really\n\n426\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.760\nsee some of those different\ntype ona path affect options.\n\n427\n00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.480\nThe Rainbow versus Skew\nversus the 3D Ribbon and\n\n428\n00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.920\nthe Stair stepping along that path.\n\n429\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.130\nAnd so that's really the only\nreason why I wanted to.\n\n430\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.630\nI didn't wanna out that little path so\nI figured I'd show you that, all right.\n\n431\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.110\nSo that's type on a path.\n\n432\n00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:24.250\nAnd the other concept that I wanted\nto put in this lesson is text drop.\n\n433\n00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:28.740\nSo we wrapped text on a path, now we're\ngonna wrap text around an object.\n\n434\n00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.500\n>> Aha!\n\n435\n00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.210\n>> This one is pretty quick, all right?\n\n436\n00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:36.560\nSo with the text drop,\nI have some type already in here.\n\n437\n00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.110\nI've got two objects.\n\n438\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.430\nI wanna take this start and\nI wanna put it right here in the middle.\n\n439\n00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.590\nRight here in the of the text.\n\n440\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.340\nAnd you see this all the time in articles.\n\n441\n00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.356\nBut I now want the text, to wrap around,\n\n442\n00:21:50.356 --> 00:21:54.498\nsaid I don't- [CROSSTALK]\n>> basically going underneath that object\n\n443\n00:21:54.498 --> 00:21:55.880\nbecause of our stacking order.\n\n444\n00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.870\n>> Yeah, exactly just we've\nadded items we've added text and\n\n445\n00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.195\nwe've added stack and yeah\n>> Just hiding it from us.\n\n446\n00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:04.840\n> Exactly, so I want that to go around.\n\n447\n00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.990\nIt's not that we're formatting the text,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n448\n00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:11.220\n>> We're telling the object\nto have a text file.\n\n449\n00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.725\nYeah, so it's somewhat reversed almost.\n\n450\n00:22:13.725 --> 00:22:15.190\n>> Okay\n>> It's not the text it's the object.\n\n451\n00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.770\n>> Yeah, I would have thought\nwe would had to tell the text,\n\n452\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.120\nhey don't go underneath this shape.\n\n453\n00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.079\n>> Yeah, exactly\n>> But you got to tell the shape.\n\n454\n00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:22.780\nTo keep the text away from it.\n\n455\n00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.620\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n456\n00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.920\nIt's like making a border around me.\n\n457\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.720\nAll right, so I've got the item\nthat I wanna add text wrap to.\n\n458\n00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.380\nI go to the type menu,\n\n459\n00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.405\nI go that's not the type menu I'm\nsorry that's the object menu.\n\n460\n00:22:33.405 --> 00:22:36.630\n[LAUGH] My bad and I go to the text wrap,\n\n461\n00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.610\nyou see how I even went there I\nwant the type menu cuz my God.\n\n462\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:40.552\nWe just start talking about that.\n\n463\n00:22:40.552 --> 00:22:44.020\nAnyways, [LAUGH] so\nI go to the text wrap and I go to Make.\n\n464\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:49.360\nAnd if I go to Make, you can see\nthat it [SOUND] wraps anything.\n\n465\n00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.980\nThat object now has\na force field around it.\n\n466\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.600\nSo when it encounters text It will\ntake the text and wrap it around it.\n\n467\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.650\n>> I was just going to ask you what\nhappens if you move that object,\n\n468\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.420\nsure enough,\nthe force field stays with it!\n\n469\n00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.610\n>> Yes, I could feel the force with you.\n\n470\n00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:04.202\nI read that.\n\n471\n00:23:04.202 --> 00:23:08.450\n[LAUGH] So I take this,\nI can move around now.\n\n472\n00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:09.580\nOne thing you can see how much,\n\n473\n00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:15.260\nyou can see the text,\nthere's like a space around the star.\n\n474\n00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.960\nThat's because there are some what\nin other program's called off set.\n\n475\n00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.890\nYou can offset how much it's here.\n\n476\n00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.920\nAnd I wanna show you it's\nin the text drop options.\n\n477\n00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.280\nSo, I still have the item selected.\n\n478\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.460\nAnd it's offset here too.\n\n479\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.370\nSo, just testing myself.\n\n480\n00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:36.000\nSo we have to be offset so\nyou can see, I can push this off.\n\n481\n00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.300\nWhoops, let me preview it so\nyou can see it.\n\n482\n00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:44.120\nSo you see the father away from the force\nfield I'm creating or the closer.\n\n483\n00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:44.720\nI want it to.\n\n484\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.000\nYou can even go negative.\n\n485\n00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.110\nI'm not sure if you really wanted to but\nthat's how it can go.\n\n486\n00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.230\n>> And so some of your text is actually\ngoing to be underneath your object.\n\n487\n00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:58.280\n>> And then the last little point I\nwanted to throw in there was this guy.\n\n488\n00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.650\nSo I've got my circle and\n\n489\n00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.480\nI'm gonna put it here cuz maybe I\njust want it to wrap around here.\n\n490\n00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.060\nSo I'm going to do the same thing, right?\n\n491\n00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.090\nI'm going to go to object.\n\n492\n00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.380\nI'm going to go to text wrap.\n\n493\n00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.370\nAnd I'm going to go to make.\n\n494\n00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.110\nAnd nothing is going to happen.\n\n495\n00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.130\nAnd you actually kind of mentioned it.\n\n496\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.570\n>> I did.\n>> [LAUGH] You did.\n\n497\n00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.938\nDo you know why this isn't working?\n\n498\n00:24:14.938 --> 00:24:20.310\nNo, I can see the text through your shape.\n\n499\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.020\nLet's think about it,\nlet's walk our way through.\n\n500\n00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.690\nWe can see through the shape.\n\n501\n00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.820\nYou didn't have the shape\nselected when you did that?\n\n502\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.720\nRemember, it's all about\n>> Cuz it's underneath the text.\n\n503\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.710\n>> Stacking order.\n\n504\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.220\n>> So, because I can see that text,\nI should have realized the text was on top\n\n505\n00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:41.050\nof the circle, so\nthen the text wrap wouldn't effect it.\n\n506\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.530\nYes and you know why,\nbecause text wrap only goes down.\n\n507\n00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.470\nIt does not go up.\n\n508\n00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.690\nYes, so I was like, yeah I kinda\nput you on the spot there didn't I?\n\n509\n00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.730\n>> Yes.\n>> But since you mentioned the whole,\n\n510\n00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.000\nit's the stacking order.\n\n511\n00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.980\nYes, I put the text and\n\n512\n00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.580\nthe star, well if I did the circle\nthen a text, it's not gonna work.\n\n513\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.190\nSo all I got to do is just make sure\nthat whatever item you want to have,\n\n514\n00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.980\ndo the text wrapping, you gotta\nmake sure that it's in the front.\n\n515\n00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.060\nI am just gonna bring all\nthe way to the front.\n\n516\n00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.620\nSo, now you can see that\ntext wrap will work.\n\n517\n00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.450\nText wrap only goes down,\nit does not go up.\n\n518\n00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.565\nSo the item has to be above the text.\n\n519\n00:25:17.565 --> 00:25:18.465\nAnd that's what we got.\n\n520\n00:25:18.465 --> 00:25:21.000\nGreat look at some of\nthe more creative ways we can\n\n521\n00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.600\nadd text into our document.\n\n522\n00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.350\nWe can either have that text\nfollow a path that we create or\n\n523\n00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.160\nwe can have that text\nwrap around an object.\n\n524\n00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.370\nWe thank you for that Von, I hope\neverybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n525\n00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:36.440\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n526\n00:25:36.440 --> 00:26:37.010\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n527\n00:26:37.010 -->

00:00:20.379\n>> I'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing a Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:22.692\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.692 --> 00:00:26.777\nwe're gonna be focusing in on\ncreating outlines out of text and\n\n6\n00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:31.370\na newcomer to Adobe Illustrator,\nwhich is that Touch Type tool.\n\n7\n00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.655\nSo new, I don't know what it is, and\nI haven't been able to figure it out yet.\n\n8\n00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:37.510\nVonne is keeping me in the dark.\n\n9\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.320\nGonna have a surprise for\nus in this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.508\nHow you doing, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:43.070\n>> I'm great [LAUGH] ready\nto be able to tell you about\n\n12\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.880\nthat tool that you keep asking me about.\n\n13\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.165\nAnd I'm like no, I'm not gonna\ntell you until we do the episode.\n\n14\n00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:48.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n15\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.010\nI'll be able to share with you this\nfantastic new tool that I find quite fun.\n\n16\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.845\nAnd it's really great.\n\n17\n00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:56.765\n>> I\"m looking forward to it.\n\n18\n00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:01.790\n>> Good [LAUGH] all right, so\nnow you can add text to your document.\n\n19\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.590\nAnd of course, any time you add text to\nyour document, you are using text as text.\n\n20\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.150\nIt's going to have a font.\n\n21\n00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.770\nAnd we've talked about fonts and having\nfonts in your machine and all of that kind\n\n22\n00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.700\nof wonderful stuff in some of our previous\nepisodes talking about typography.\n\n23\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.690\nSo when you create text outlines,\nyou're actually removing the text.\n\n24\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.670\nIt's no longer text, it becomes shapes.\n\n25\n00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.190\nAnd if you have shapes, you have no font,\nyou have no font files.\n\n26\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.502\nSo then you don't have to worry\nabout mix matched fonts or\n\n27\n00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:35.960\nsending a font to a printer or\nto somebody else.\n\n28\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.919\nIt just doesn't exist, it's shapes so-\n>> Very cool.\n\n29\n00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:42.170\n>> There's good things, but then there\ncan be some drawbacks, of course.\n\n30\n00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.570\nBecause if I'm sending you a document\nthat is in the final stage,\n\n31\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.850\nand it's in the outlines, and\n\n32\n00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.670\nyou want to edit that text, well,\nyou can't, because it's not text, okay.\n\n33\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.560\nSo you have good points and\nbad points and when and\n\n34\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.390\nwhy you want to use outline text, so.\n\n35\n00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.170\nIt's quite easy to do.\n\n36\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.170\nSo let me show you, all right.\n\n37\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.220\nSo I've got this wonderful file,\nthat's Outlines, right.\n\n38\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.290\nAnd you can even see, but\nthis looks like just rectangles, right.\n\n39\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.950\nThat's a rectangle, that's a rectangle\nthere, and so on and so forth.\n\n40\n00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.740\nSo right now, this is in an Arial font.\n\n41\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.340\nAnd I just made it whatever a font size\nthat I wanted to make it visually.\n\n42\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.005\nSo if I sent this file to a printer or\nto you, and you didn't have Arial.\n\n43\n00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:28.373\nNow, for\nyou to not have Arial is pretty rare.\n\n44\n00:02:28.373 --> 00:02:30.961\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But let's say it was like some really\n\n45\n00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:33.710\ncrazy font or whatever, and\nI sent this to somebody else.\n\n46\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.490\nThey won't have that font file.\n\n47\n00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.120\nSo I'd have to package it,\nwhich you can totally do, right.\n\n48\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.603\nYou just go to File Package.\n\n49\n00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:41.945\nAnd its just goes ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:46.158\npackages it all up with the fonts that\nwe've talked about in some other episodes.\n\n51\n00:02:46.158 --> 00:02:50.614\nBut I don't want that, okay,\nI want this to just be shapes, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:52.100\nSo how do you do it?\n\n53\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.398\nIt's quite easy,\nyou go to the black arrow tool.\n\n54\n00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:57.140\nYou can right-click, if you wanted to.\n\n55\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.830\nOr you could also go to the Type menu and\nyou can create outlines.\n\n56\n00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.100\nAnd as soon as you create outlines,\nit's going to create the group.\n\n57\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.340\nYou can see up here at the top,\n\n58\n00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.020\nin the tool options bar, that this\nis now just a group of shapes, okay.\n\n59\n00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.138\nSo then you can do whatever you\nwant with it, I can ungroup it.\n\n60\n00:03:15.138 --> 00:03:19.909\nAnd this is where, if I'm doing logos,\nwhen I’m creating a logo, and\n\n61\n00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.560\nI have the name of it.\n\n62\n00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.809\nWhen I'm done with the logo,\nI'm finished, and\n\n63\n00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:27.260\nI'm ready to start putting it wherever,\nI never have is as a font.\n\n64\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.378\nIt's always-\n>> Really?\n\n65\n00:03:28.378 --> 00:03:29.370\n>> In shapes.\n\n66\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.370\n>> Because?\n\n67\n00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.890\n>> Because then it's all vectors, right?\n\n68\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.481\nIf I'm sending this to a T-shirt company,\nor I'm gonna put it on a book or\n\n69\n00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:42.087\na poster, I don't wanna ever have\nanybody messing with the font itself.\n\n70\n00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:46.010\nCuz then they could just take\nthe text tool, type something else.\n\n71\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.540\nI want it to be shapes.\n\n72\n00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.910\nNow, yes, they could modify it,\nbut it's not text.\n\n73\n00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.550\n>> And as a vector,\nI would imagine it scales well, as well.\n\n74\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.220\n>> Exactly, yeah, totally great point.\n\n75\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.760\n>> Very good.\n\n76\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.050\n>> So now that I have it created\nas outlines, I've ungrouped it.\n\n77\n00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.990\nNow you can see that\nthis is a compound path,\n\n78\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.370\nright, we talked about that\nin some other episodes.\n\n79\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.176\nSo you could release it\nfrom its compound path.\n\n80\n00:04:09.176 --> 00:04:10.810\nI mean,\nyou could do whatever you want with this,\n\n81\n00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.390\nbecause maybe I want this O\nto be a little bit bigger.\n\n82\n00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.070\nOutlines, and I wanna kind of\nextend this and I wanna tilt this.\n\n83\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.840\nAnd I wanna do all sorts of different\nthings that I wanna do to my text.\n\n84\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.912\nI couldn't do this to text as text.\n\n85\n00:04:24.912 --> 00:04:27.330\nIt's not possible, okay.\n\n86\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.189\nAnd one other thing I wanted to point out\nthat, why you might wanna create outlines\n\n87\n00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:36.075\nto text for formatting reasons,\nnot just to play around with it.\n\n88\n00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.597\nIf I click on this one and\nI go to, I mean,\n\n89\n00:04:38.597 --> 00:04:41.805\nI can change it to different solid colors,\nright.\n\n90\n00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:44.445\nI could do blues, I could do patterns.\n\n91\n00:04:44.445 --> 00:04:47.421\nBut notice as soon as I click on\na gradient, the gradient doesn't work.\n\n92\n00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:54.330\nOkay, you cannot apply gradients as fill\nto text as text, it just doesn't work.\n\n93\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.510\nSo the way you can is if you\ncreate outlines with it.\n\n94\n00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.724\nSo now that these are in outlines already,\n\n95\n00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:02.192\nyou could see that I've\ngot the text selected.\n\n96\n00:05:02.192 --> 00:05:05.560\nNow it's just shapes, so\nI could add my gradient.\n\n97\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.150\nI could go to my gradient tool, I could,\nwhoops, gotta get to the gradient tool.\n\n98\n00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.290\nGo ahead and draw the line across of\nall my letters, or so on and so forth.\n\n99\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.358\nSo that's another reason why there are\nsome times where I wanna create outlines\n\n100\n00:05:18.358 --> 00:05:20.430\nas text, is to do the fun formatting.\n\n101\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.805\n>> Very cool.\n>> Mm-hm, so\n\n102\n00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:24.570\nI mean, that's really what it is.\n\n103\n00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.266\nYou just create outlines, okay.\n\n104\n00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:28.851\nBut just to kind of go\nover a few other things,\n\n105\n00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:32.170\njust to kind of in\nthe practicality of when and why.\n\n106\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.162\nYou see here, I have this\nHop Along Hills logo that I've created.\n\n107\n00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:37.476\nI didn't create the art\nboard in the right size,\n\n108\n00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:39.293\ncuz I was just kind of playing around.\n\n109\n00:05:39.293 --> 00:05:42.460\nAnd it was just do it, and\nI can change the art board later.\n\n110\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.440\nHere, this is not text,\nthis is just a group of shapes.\n\n111\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.290\nBecause I wanted to make\nsure that this logo has\n\n112\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.470\njust paths when I go off and send it.\n\n113\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.070\nNow, just from me having\nmany years of experience,\n\n114\n00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.310\ndo you know how many times I've gone\nback to old files or old logos and\n\n115\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.475\nsaid, I don't know what the font is,\ncuz I already created it into outlines.\n\n116\n00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:10.315\nRight, so it's gone, I have no idea,\nand I have to go back and\n\n117\n00:06:10.315 --> 00:06:11.747\nlook through all these fonts.\n\n118\n00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:12.408\nI'm like, does that match?\n\n119\n00:06:12.408 --> 00:06:13.307\nDoes that match?\n\n120\n00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:16.104\n>> So if you wanted to make a change\nto the actual text at this point.\n\n121\n00:06:16.104 --> 00:06:18.437\n>> Yeah, or\neven just remember what font I used.\n\n122\n00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:20.375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which I do all the time.\n\n123\n00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:25.931\nSo what I've done, just as my little\nthing, I will either, if it's a logo\n\n124\n00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:31.582\nlike this, I'll create a layer that's\nin here, and I'll just add here.\n\n125\n00:06:31.582 --> 00:06:33.870\nHere, yeah, sorry,\nthat the Layers panel is a little hidden.\n\n126\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.770\nSo I can just create this layer, and you\nsee I've just made a layer called text.\n\n127\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.420\nSo I kept a version of this text as text,\nso I know that this is Helvetica Neue.\n\n128\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.717\nSo if I ever came back to this file later,\nI could remember, that's what it is.\n\n129\n00:06:48.717 --> 00:06:52.094\nSo now that's just me,\nI'll make a hidden layer like that,\n\n130\n00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:54.757\nbecause it's kind of\nburned me a couple times.\n\n131\n00:06:54.757 --> 00:06:56.420\n>> Yes [LAUGH]\n>> Yes,\n\n132\n00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.360\nthe other thing is you'd make another\nversion, you do a whole other file.\n\n133\n00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.150\nThat's how I used to do it,\nand especially sometimes,\n\n134\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.280\nI don't want to keep\nthis text in this file.\n\n135\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.660\nCuz if I send it to you, then I\nstill have that whole font issue and\n\n136\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.450\neverything like that.\n\n137\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.230\nSo I actually have my production file.\n\n138\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.660\nI call it production,\nlike logo_production.\n\n139\n00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.150\nAnd then the other one, logo_final.\n\n140\n00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.660\nAnd that version of that file is\nthe one I create outlines with and\n\n141\n00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.420\nthen use it for however I want.\n\n142\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.698\nSo whatever technique you wanna do,\njust giving you a little tip here,\n\n143\n00:07:30.698 --> 00:07:33.712\njust make sure you remember,\nwhere is that font.\n\n144\n00:07:33.712 --> 00:07:34.330\n>> All right.\n\n145\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.642\n>> And what is it and\nhowever which way you want.\n\n146\n00:07:35.642 --> 00:07:36.468\n>> A great little tip there.\n\n147\n00:07:36.468 --> 00:07:41.598\n>> Yeah, and there's also times\nwhere I've, in print production,\n\n148\n00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:45.468\nto where they will request\nall text is in outlines,\n\n149\n00:07:45.468 --> 00:07:48.720\nwhere they're like outline all texts.\n\n150\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.350\nIf you have the specs for an ad or\n\n151\n00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.878\nsomething that you're\nputting in a magazine,\n\n152\n00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:56.250\nthat sometimes they will say that, because\nthey don't want to deal with font files.\n\n153\n00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.980\nThink about they're getting ads created\nfrom all sorts of different people and\n\n154\n00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.520\ninto this huge production for\na conference or whatever.\n\n155\n00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.700\nThey're not dealing with that.\n\n156\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.890\nSo they're saying, okay, give me all\nof the, here are the dimensions.\n\n157\n00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:14.144\nHere's CMYK, 300 dpi or\nppi, and outline all text.\n\n158\n00:08:14.144 --> 00:08:17.610\nSo I would take this whole,\neven though it's body text-\n\n159\n00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.830\n>> Can you outline even that body text?\n\n160\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.136\n>> Exactly,\nthat's where we're going, yeah.\n\n161\n00:08:21.136 --> 00:08:25.510\nSo I could take both of this, all\nthe text, I could actually do a Ctrl+A or\n\n162\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.652\nan Option+A to say select everything,\nright.\n\n163\n00:08:28.652 --> 00:08:34.130\nAnd I can go ahead and say take all\nthe type and create outlines out of it.\n\n164\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.859\nSo even though I selected shapes,\nit's like, well that's not text, so\n\n165\n00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:38.809\nit's not going to create\noutlines out of your text.\n\n166\n00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.590\nSo I can just say, get everything\nthat I got, make it all outlines.\n\n167\n00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:48.162\nAnd now, when I send this file, there's no\nfonts, there's no text in this document.\n\n168\n00:08:48.162 --> 00:08:51.090\nIt's all vector paths, vector shapes.\n\n169\n00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.470\nDon't have to worry about those font\nfiles, and then it's fantastic.\n\n170\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.320\nBut again, what should you do?\n\n171\n00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.009\nMake a backup.\n\n172\n00:08:57.009 --> 00:08:58.478\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n173\n00:08:58.478 --> 00:08:59.288\n>> Make sure you have\n\n174\n00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:02.046\na version that's text and\nhave a version that's outlines.\n\n175\n00:09:02.046 --> 00:09:05.430\nAnd that's the one you send off to\nyour printer, and so on and so forth.\n\n176\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:11.222\nAnd that is creating outlines from text\n>> Probably a very important tip,\n\n177\n00:09:11.222 --> 00:09:13.279\nespecially if you're gonna\ndo the body text like that,\n\n178\n00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:15.710\ncuz there's a good chance they find\na typo or want a word changed.\n\n179\n00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.130\nAnd once you had converted that\nto outline, you're in trouble.\n\n180\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.496\n>> Exactly yeah, yeah, and I've done it.\n\n181\n00:09:21.496 --> 00:09:22.564\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n182\n00:09:22.564 --> 00:09:24.118\n>> So don't do it.\n\n183\n00:09:24.118 --> 00:09:27.050\nAll right, so\nnow we've come to your favorite part.\n\n184\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.230\n>> Drum roll, please.\n\n185\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.660\nIs it finally time to figure out\nwhat this Touch Type tool is?\n\n186\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.006\n>> Yes, so we're ready to go.\n\n187\n00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:36.880\nSo this is actually a fun little tool.\n\n188\n00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.530\nAnd I wanted to put it in here with the\ncreate outlines, because I think this is\n\n189\n00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.990\nwhere it really exemplifies why\nyou'd want to use it, okay.\n\n190\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.999\nSo when I did this first one,\nright, I created outlines.\n\n191\n00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:48.070\nAnd then I ungrouped it so\n\n192\n00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.450\nI could change the letters, turn it,\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n193\n00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.730\nBut it's no longer text,\nI can't format it any more.\n\n194\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.460\nWith the Touch Type tool,\nit's like you're creating outlines, but\n\n195\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.400\nyou're not going all\nthe way to the outlines.\n\n196\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.473\nIt's kinda like this cool limbo\nworld to where you can still change\n\n197\n00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:12.730\nindividual characters individually\nwithout making it outlines.\n\n198\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.325\nLet me show you,\nI think is the best way to demonstrate.\n\n199\n00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:18.275\nNow I can show you here in the Character\npanel there is the Touch Type tool,\n\n200\n00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:20.430\nright there at the top.\n\n201\n00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.120\nSo that's the easiest place\nthat I can go to, and\n\n202\n00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.410\nyou can also get it in\nthe group of the type tools.\n\n203\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.400\nIt's down there at the bottom.\n\n204\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.840\nSo either which way you can find it.\n\n205\n00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.650\nI just always seem to find it here.\n\n206\n00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.860\nSo if I take my selected, whoops, sorry.\n\n207\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.801\nLet me go back to the black arrow tool,\nand I go to the Touch Type tool.\n\n208\n00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:41.240\nYou can see that now what it does is\nit's actually creating each letter,\n\n209\n00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.560\nor it's allowing me to take each letter,\nindividually.\n\n210\n00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.010\nAnd I can make it bigger,\nor I could take this and\n\n211\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.190\nmaybe I could go ahead and\noops, there it is.\n\n212\n00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.427\nI can rotate this, maybe go ahead and\nextend this out, or\n\n213\n00:10:56.427 --> 00:11:02.275\nI can do whatever I want with this,\nalmost like it was a regular shape, right?\n\n214\n00:11:02.275 --> 00:11:03.100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n215\n00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.934\n>> But it's still not outlines,\nbecause if I go back here,\n\n216\n00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:08.035\nnow this,to me this is the coolest part.\n\n217\n00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:11.290\nI've done all these kinda tweaks and\nformats and everything like that.\n\n218\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.940\nWell, I don't want it to be Arial anymore.\n\n219\n00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.900\nWell, I could go ahead and\nmake it whatever font I want.\n\n220\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.680\nIt keeps it text as text.\n\n221\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.250\nYeah, it's super cool.\n\n222\n00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.370\nSo now it keeps the way that I scaled\neach letter or rotated it, but\n\n223\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.170\nI can change the fonts,\nI can do whatever I want.\n\n224\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.160\nAnd that is a pretty awesome\nnew feature that Illustrator CC\n\n225\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.110\nhas with the Touch Type tool.\n\n226\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.570\nAnd I think it's awesome.\n\n227\n00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.340\n>> That is really cool.\n\n228\n00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.380\nNow, could you get your text tool and\ngo in there and\n\n229\n00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.165\nmodify that text at this point?\n\n230\n00:11:41.165 --> 00:11:44.081\n>> Like with a text or-\n>> Change of letter to-\n\n231\n00:11:44.081 --> 00:11:46.353\n>> Exactly, yes, good point.\n\n232\n00:11:46.353 --> 00:11:51.321\nLike I want to outlinesies,\n[LAUGH] because I\n\n233\n00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:56.030\nlike to put y's and ie's on everything.\n\n234\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.370\nSo yeah, you could do whatever.\n\n235\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.240\nI just,\nI can't think of anything to change.\n\n236\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.644\nI could just like aaaa [LAUGH].\n\n237\n00:12:02.644 --> 00:12:04.971\nSo yes, you can put and add type.\n\n238\n00:12:04.971 --> 00:12:09.680\nIt is type as type, font,\nformatting, anything you want.\n\n239\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.370\n>> Fantastic.\n\n240\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.208\n>> Yeah, pretty cool.\n\n241\n00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:12.400\n>> We love it.\nAll right,\n\n242\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.720\nthat was definitely worth the wait,\nreally cool tool there.\n\n243\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.628\nThat was the new one, the Touch Type tool.\n\n244\n00:12:18.628 --> 00:12:21.330\nSo we thank you for\nthose fantastic demonstrations, Vonne.\n\n245\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.490\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n246\n00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.250\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n247\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.030\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n248\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.912\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n249\n00:12:28.912 --> 00:12:37.159\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.810\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.026\nToday we're doing\nAdobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:24.898\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be looking at formatting lists and\n\n6\n00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:25.900\ntab stops.\n\n7\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.190\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.010\nHow you doing Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.500\n>> Great, I'm actually really\nexcited to teach this lesson because\n\n10\n00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.850\nit's actually one of my favorites.\n\n11\n00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.980\n>> Really?\n>> Yes, it's weird.\n\n12\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.160\nI don't know why, I'm just so\ndrawn to tab stops and bullets and\n\n13\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.182\nformatting list because if\nyou learn what they do.\n\n14\n00:00:45.182 --> 00:00:51.060\nIt kinda changes your life in the world\nof text formatting and typesetting and\n\n15\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.720\nespecially when you're doing\nextensive type setting in like books.\n\n16\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.846\nI can't tell you how much tab stops and\nformatting bullets has changed my world.\n\n17\n00:01:01.846 --> 00:01:02.861\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n18\n00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:05.770\neverybody out there get ready\nto have your world changed.\n\n19\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.340\nAs we learn about tab stops and\nformatting our lists.\n\n20\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.730\n>> Yes, and what I'm going to teach\nyou in Illustrator you can use this in\n\n21\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.970\nany other program that\nactually has text formatting.\n\n22\n00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.220\nYou can use this in In Design,\nMicrosoft Word, it's all there.\n\n23\n00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.810\nYou can do this.\n\n24\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.260\nMaybe the icons might be\na little different but\n\n25\n00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.720\nthe concepts are the most\nimportant thing to understand.\n\n26\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.350\n>> Fantastic.\n>> So that's what hopefully I will\n\n27\n00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.360\nbe able to show you.\n\n28\n00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.730\nSo, let's go.\n\n29\n00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.755\nSo I've got this document.\n\n30\n00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:36.470\n[COUGH] And I've got just\na few little notes right here.\n\n31\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.390\nJust to kind of get us started is that for\none thing,\n\n32\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.680\nif you're gonna do tab stops\nyou need to have tabs, okay.\n\n33\n00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.660\nThat whole like, space,space,space,space\nis not gonna cut it here.\n\n34\n00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.240\nOkay there's a reason why we like\nto use tabs because you can format\n\n35\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.550\nwhere the tabs actually stop.\n\n36\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.770\nAnd that's really fun.\n\n37\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.500\nBut if you're going to do that you need\nto make sure you can see all of those\n\n38\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.580\nnon printing characters.\n\n39\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.830\nThose hidden characters,\n\n40\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.250\nthat's something to definitely make sure\nyou always have up in any of the product.\n\n41\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.520\nBut since we're doing Illustrator\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n42\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.600\nIt is in the tabs panel.\n\n43\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.930\nYou will be needing to\nget the glyphs panel,\n\n44\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.950\nwhich we've talked about before,\nto add those bullets.\n\n45\n00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.400\nAnd then the different little icons that\nare on the tabs panel is what controls.\n\n46\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.620\nWhat type of tab it is, your first line\nand hanging indents are very important\n\n47\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.910\non that and it's all just putting all\nof these different things on the ruler.\n\n48\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.350\nSo here we go.\n\n49\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.690\nLet's go with the type menu to\nshow the hidden characters,\n\n50\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.380\nbecause I have text that I actually\njust copied out from a text file, a Word\n\n51\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.380\nfile that I went ahead and pasted in here\nso I could just get some text going.\n\n52\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.610\nAnd so in this text box right here,\nyou can see that I have tabs.\n\n53\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.835\nHow do I know that these are tabs?\n\n54\n00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.680\nIt's because of that\nlittle icon right there,\n\n55\n00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.190\nthe two little chevrony little things.\n\n56\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.350\nSo you can see that I have First,\nLast, Department.\n\n57\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.250\nI added you in the list there, Mike.\n\n58\n00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.890\n>> Fantastic.\n\n59\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.350\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So you can\n\n60\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.740\nsee that it's got like a word and\nthen a tab.\n\n61\n00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.180\nThen a word, then a tab.\n\n62\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.830\nAnd then an enter,\nlike a carriage return or a paragraph.\n\n63\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.350\nBut you can see that I've\ngot this same format.\n\n64\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.600\nWord, tab, word, tab.\n\n65\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.280\nBut where they stop are different.\n\n66\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.090\nOkay, because my name and your name and\nTim's name are all different lengths but\n\n67\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.640\nit's not stopping at the same point.\n\n68\n00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.290\n>> The tabs are not aligned.\n\n69\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.990\nSo we gotta throw some spaces in there to\npush those characters over a little bit.\n\n70\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.620\n>> Yes, and then a lot of\ntimes what people do is like,\n\n71\n00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.100\ninstead of doing one tab, you do what?\n\n72\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.800\n>> I put my space bar in there, right?\n\n73\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.790\nThat's how I'm gonna move those guys\nover a little bit, space, space, space.\n\n74\n00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.360\n>> Yes, or you add one that has two\ntabs and one that has one tab and\n\n75\n00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.680\none that has three tabs to\ntry to get them all lined up.\n\n76\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.820\nOkay, why?\n\n77\n00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.940\nBecause, and this is especially in\na lot of your word processing, is, tabs\n\n78\n00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.400\nwill stop at every half inch\non the ruler by default.\n\n79\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.310\nSo you think about if your text is longer\nthan that half inch and then you Tab,\n\n80\n00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.990\nit's gonna go to the next default\ntab stop which is the one inch.\n\n81\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.160\nBut you have another word that's\nshorter and you hit a Tab,\n\n82\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.520\nit's only gonna go to that next,\nthe first one.\n\n83\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.810\nSo that's where it is,\nit's all about where you're tabbing and\n\n84\n00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.590\nwhere it can stop at\nthe next default tab stop.\n\n85\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.050\n>> Okay, so\nthere are already tab stops in there,\n\n86\n00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.440\nthe problem is they're just the default\ntab stops, not where we want them.\n\n87\n00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.140\n>> Yes, yes.\nAnd that's a little bit more prevalent in\n\n88\n00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.850\nyour word processing, but so with here\nit's just kind of all over the place.\n\n89\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.730\nIt's like okay well.\n\n90\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.694\nOkay, yep,\nthough actually it's doing the same thing.\n\n91\n00:04:33.694 --> 00:04:35.935\nYou can see up there you have\nthe two different tab stops here.\n\n92\n00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:38.920\nSo this one is lined here,\nthis one is lined there.\n\n93\n00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.480\nAnd that's where these tabs are stopping.\n\n94\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.140\nOkay, so\ngot the idea of our default tab stops.\n\n95\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.540\nWe have tabs in a document.\n\n96\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.250\nI have my text frame selected,\nbecause I do want to select,\n\n97\n00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.930\nI want to format all of the tabs.\n\n98\n00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.350\nTabs are a paragraph level formatting.\n\n99\n00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.940\nSo I could format one paragraph\ndifferently than the other paragraph.\n\n100\n00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.600\nOkay, so\nthat's just a key point right there.\n\n101\n00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.230\n>> This is again a great place to point\nwhy we show those non printing characters.\n\n102\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.900\nBecause we might not realize\nthat each one of those lines\n\n103\n00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.290\nis actually a separate paragraph.\n\n104\n00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.080\n>> Exactly.\n\n105\n00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.490\nYep, gotta show the paragraphs,\ngotta show the tabs.\n\n106\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.120\nAll right.\n\n107\n00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.570\nSo I've this, if I go to Window and\nI go to type, there are my Tabs,\n\n108\n00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.120\nnow that's my tabs panel, okay,\nor actually like my tabs ruler.\n\n109\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.640\n>> So\nif I click on it you can see that now,\n\n110\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.420\nI would say if you have\na text box selected.\n\n111\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.180\nSay you put the tabs part up, keep it,\n\n112\n00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.370\nbecause what it does,\nit aligns right there.\n\n113\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.480\nYou can see that the edge of my\ntext box is actually aligned with\n\n114\n00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.780\nthe 0 on this ruler.\n\n115\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.450\nOkay?\nSo that's very good.\n\n116\n00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.890\nNow you can if you move it.\n\n117\n00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.010\nIt's still gonna do what you tell it\nto do, it's just not gonna line up.\n\n118\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.620\nSo it's nice to kinda keep it right\nin line with what you're doing.\n\n119\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.770\nOkay, so I've got this ruler.\n\n120\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.550\nWhat do we see on this ruler?\n\n121\n00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.590\nOkay, you've got\nthe different alignments that\n\n122\n00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.385\nthe text will align to when\nthe text stops at the tab.\n\n123\n00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:08.150\n[LAUGH] It's kind of a mouthful to say but\nit's much easier when you demonstrate it.\n\n124\n00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.460\nBut I'm just trying to show you\nit because they're really small.\n\n125\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.110\nThat's the other thing.\n\n126\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.400\nAll these things are really, really\ntiny and where you're putting the stuff.\n\n127\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.960\nThis is a left-aligned tab stop,\nthis is a center-aligned tab stop,\n\n128\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.500\nthis is a right-aligned tab stop,\nand this is a decimal tab stop.\n\n129\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.560\nSo it's going to line up the decimals.\n\n130\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.050\nAnd that's the alignment part, okay.\n\n131\n00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.140\nSo you've got those different\ntypes of alignments of tab stops.\n\n132\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.090\nAnd then you have these two\nlittle guys right here.\n\n133\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.280\nYou've got like a top triangle and\na bottom triangle on this very small\n\n134\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.110\nstrip of white on top of this ruler, okay.\n\n135\n00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.110\nSo it's just that small little white\nstrip of where you're going to\n\n136\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.950\nformat where you want the tabs to stop and\nhow you want your indents to go.\n\n137\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.880\nSo, that's, let me take my\nmagnification off so you can see it.\n\n138\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.360\nSo, you can see that I want all\nof these are not lining up.\n\n139\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.090\nSo, I wanna take a left-aligned tab stop.\n\n140\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.560\nI’m choosing which tab stop or\nwhat alignment I want.\n\n141\n00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.060\nAnd if I just make a single click right\nthere on that little white strip,\n\n142\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.340\nright there, you can see that\nI have created a tab, stop.\n\n143\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.740\nI'm saying hey, all yall tab, and\nthen you stop and look at how it aligns.\n\n144\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.610\nIt aligns left.\n\n145\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.480\n>> Beautiful.\n\n146\n00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.565\n>> And if I take this and\ngo a little further down and I click,\n\n147\n00:07:24.565 --> 00:07:26.490\nI've now added another stop.\n\n148\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.580\nSo you can see that I'm saying stop,\nalign,\n\n149\n00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.720\nstop, align, that's what a tab stop is.\n\n150\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.030\n>> Very cool.\n>> Super awesome I love it.\n\n151\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.308\n>> So now even with text\nthat's of different lengths,\n\n152\n00:07:35.308 --> 00:07:37.005\nthey're gonna line up nice and neat.\n\n153\n00:07:37.005 --> 00:07:39.580\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd if this was something where\n\n154\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.750\nI wanted all the text instead of\nto left align at the tab stop.\n\n155\n00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.260\nI could just take this and I could since\nit's see it's highlighted, it's got\n\n156\n00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.340\na little gray box around it, so that's\nthe tab stop that I have on right now.\n\n157\n00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.570\nIf I just click on\nthe right align tab stop or\n\n158\n00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.895\nright justify tab you see it's like.\n\n159\n00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:02.360\nIt's doing it, but now it's all kinda,\nyou just gotta move this over.\n\n160\n00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.100\nSee I just click, hold and drag.\n\n161\n00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.460\nAnd move it over, and so now it's saying\nhere's the stop, everybody write a line.\n\n162\n00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.180\nAnd so I could take this and\nright align this.\n\n163\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:17.890\nI can take this guy, let me select it,\nand I can center align it if I want to.\n\n164\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.150\nIt's just really great.\n\n165\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.620\nNow the thing is,\nwhat happened right there?\n\n166\n00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.630\nI actually,\nremember I said it's a really small area.\n\n167\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.660\n>> I actually removed the tab stop.\n\n168\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.050\nLet me just click it back on.\n\n169\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.150\nSo it's like what if I added that\ntab stop and I didn't like it or\n\n170\n00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.650\nmaybe I add it while like oops, I didn't\nwanna do that like that needs to come off.\n\n171\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.699\nIt's like taking a magnet\noff the frigerator,\n\n172\n00:08:38.699 --> 00:08:40.620\njust click, just pull it off, okay?\n\n173\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.698\nYou take the tab stop,\nyou click hold and just drag off and\n\n174\n00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:45.054\nit [SOUND] it takes it off.\n\n175\n00:08:45.054 --> 00:08:47.322\n>> Very cool.\n>> So you kind of put the magnet on and\n\n176\n00:08:47.322 --> 00:08:50.690\nthen it knows where to stop and\nyou can take the magnet off.\n\n177\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.200\nIt's really quite simple once you see\nhow to do it and understand, again,\n\n178\n00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.010\nthe concept of what's going on here.\n\n179\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.460\nTab, stop, align.\n\n180\n00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.740\nAnd that's how you can\ndo awesome tab stops.\n\n181\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.410\nAnd now, again,\n\n182\n00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.340\nI did this for all of the lines or\nall of the paragraphs that's in this.\n\n183\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.860\nBut if I wanted to I could\nselect these paragraphs and\n\n184\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.520\nhave them align separately for\nwhatever reason.\n\n185\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.460\nDoesn't make sense in this\nparticular example right here.\n\n186\n00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.410\nBut just to kinda prove that one\nparagraph can have different\n\n187\n00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.430\nformatted tab stops\nthan another paragraph.\n\n188\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.040\n>> Very cool, especially if you're making\nlike a table within a body of text or\n\n189\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.790\nsomething like that.\n\n190\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.680\nImportant to understand that it's\nnot one set of tabs stops for\n\n191\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.540\nthe entire page\n>> Yes.\n\n192\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.292\nAnd when you do, when I was doing a\ntextbook layout, there was lots of tables,\n\n193\n00:09:37.292 --> 00:09:38.740\nthere was lots of tabs.\n\n194\n00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.440\nThere was lots of bullets that\nwe're gonna get into it as well.\n\n195\n00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.290\nSo it's just again understanding\nwhy you have to do this.\n\n196\n00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:48.635\nAnd it makes your life so much easier,\nyeah, when you know what it does.\n\n197\n00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:51.165\n>> Absolutely cuz now let's say\nyou had to change something.\n\n198\n00:09:51.165 --> 00:09:54.135\nYou simply drag that tab stop around.\n\n199\n00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.595\nVersus trying to add a bunch of space bar,\n\n200\n00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:59.755\nactual spaces between characters\njust to make those changes.\n\n201\n00:09:59.755 --> 00:10:03.445\n>> And\nwhen I'm doing extensive typesetting,\n\n202\n00:10:03.445 --> 00:10:06.389\nI'm using InDesign not Illustrator\ncuz I'm doing multi-page layouts\n\n203\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.460\n>> You can,\n\n204\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.120\nall of your tab stops can be\nincorporated into paragraph styles.\n\n205\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.300\nWhich we did go over here in Illustrator.\n\n206\n00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.380\nBut you can keep all of that formatting\nin a paragraph style so when I'm\n\n207\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.860\ndoing all of that across 200 pages the tab\nstops are in there, the first line indent,\n\n208\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.490\nthe hanging indent, which I'm gonna\nshow you in a second, are in there.\n\n209\n00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.380\nEverything's in there.\n\n210\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.270\nSo if I go into the style and\nchange it cuz maybe that tab is just\n\n211\n00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.665\nnot in the right space and I formatted\nacross 15 places or however man.\n\n212\n00:10:36.665 --> 00:10:38.100\nChanges style it changes everywhere.\n\n213\n00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.560\nSo it's really handy here.\n\n214\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.300\n>> Very cool.\n\n215\n00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.100\n>> I think you can,\nyou can do that in Illustrator but\n\n216\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.240\nit's nowhere near as powerful as InDesign\n>> But again,\n\n217\n00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.038\nI was doing extensive typesetting\nI would be using hidden design.\n\n218\n00:10:50.038 --> 00:10:55.450\nSo, but anyways, I still do a lot of work\nin Illustrator that requires tabs and\n\n219\n00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:56.784\nbullets so we're going to go there.\n\n220\n00:10:56.784 --> 00:11:01.840\nSo moving on to bullets,\nI've got this list right here.\n\n221\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.980\nNow unlike some word processors\nsuch as Microsoft Word, you could\n\n222\n00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.020\njust select all of these paragraphs and\nyou hit the little bullets button, right.\n\n223\n00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.106\nYou just click the little thing and\nthen [SOUND] it just does it.\n\n224\n00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:15.095\nRight at every change in paragraph,\n\n225\n00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:18.850\ncause bullets is again another\nparagraph level of formatting.\n\n226\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.250\n>> It's not at every line,\n\n227\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.500\nit's at every change in paragraph\nis where your bullet happens.\n\n228\n00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.570\nThere is no bullet button in Illustrator,\nit just doesn't exist.\n\n229\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.290\nBut, what is a bullet?\n\n230\n00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.984\nRight?\nNow I just wanted to show you I copied\n\n231\n00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.327\nthis over from Word.\n\n232\n00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:36.080\nThis is just a glyph, right?\n\n233\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.290\nWe talked about what a glyph is.\n\n234\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.010\nIt's those special characters that's\nnot like a alphanumeric character.\n\n235\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.390\nThat's all that is.\n\n236\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.990\nWell, we know that we have\na glyph panel in Illustrator.\n\n237\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:50.380\nSo you actually have to like, you have\nto manually add the bullet into it.\n\n238\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.830\nOkay, so if you didn't have,\nI'm just gonna close this for right now.\n\n239\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:56.610\nIn this example,\n\n240\n00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.500\nI don't have any bullet character if\nyou wanna say, or glyph, to start with.\n\n241\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.843\nSo I was gonna show you where to start,\nand then if you want afterwards now that\n\n242\n00:12:04.843 --> 00:12:07.680\nwe know how to put it in,\nwe can go ahead and format it afterwards.\n\n243\n00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.520\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\n\n244\n00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.779\nput my flashing cursor in\nfront of the T in This, right.\n\n245\n00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:15.300\nSo I've got.\n\n246\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.660\nSorry, hold on while I move this up for\nyou guys, there we go.\n\n247\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.270\nFlashing cursor there.\n\n248\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.960\nYou will have to get\ninto your glyphs panel.\n\n249\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.160\nSo I'm gonna go into type and\ngo into glyphs.\n\n250\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.640\nNow I could stay within the font that\nI have, right but myriad you might not\n\n251\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.080\nhave any fun stuff so if you wanted to you\ncould go over to make like a fun font.\n\n252\n00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.770\nLike webdings or something like that.\n\n253\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.920\nWingdings and webdings those are all\nthose ones that are fun characters.\n\n254\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.550\nAnd again, still got my flashing cursor\nin the place that I want to put that\n\n255\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.070\nbullet character, that glyph.\n\n256\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.080\nSo let's put in this cute little heart,\nright.\n\n257\n00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.310\nSo all I gotta do is just double click it,\nput in my bullet character, and\n\n258\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.820\nlike there it is, okay.\n\n259\n00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.320\nNow with bullets of\ncourse you wanna format\n\n260\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.190\nthe space between the bullet and the text.\n\n261\n00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.480\nWell, that's where your\ntab stops come back in.\n\n262\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.970\nOkay, so, I'm going to use my tab and\nthere we go.\n\n263\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.520\nNow, for here you can see\nthat I've got the space and\n\n264\n00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.870\nI actually kinda like the amount of space\nbetween the bullet character and the text.\n\n265\n00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.600\nBut, look at where this goes, it doesn't\nwrap around like this amount in ruler.\n\n266\n00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:26.000\nThe next lines of how that text is\nbreaking along this text frame.\n\n267\n00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000\nIt's not lining up with it.\n\n268\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.930\nAnd this is where you get\ninto that hanging indents and\n\n269\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.560\nyour tab stops to make sure\nthey're in the right place.\n\n270\n00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.370\nSo let me go ahead and\nbring that Tabs back up.\n\n271\n00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.860\nI shouldn't have closed it but I wanted\nto get it out of the way for you guys.\n\n272\n00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.240\nOkay, so here we go.\n\n273\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.338\nSo, now I can still go ahead since my\ncursor's in this flashing my flashing\n\n274\n00:13:44.338 --> 00:13:46.040\ncursor's in this paragraph.\n\n275\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.180\nI don't have to select a text, I don't.\n\n276\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.330\nSince it is a paragraph level format,\n\n277\n00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:56.270\nas long as your cursor is in the paragraph\nyou want to format, it will do that.\n\n278\n00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.820\nSo I could add a left align tab stop and\n\n279\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.150\nkinda control where I want that space\nbetween the bullet and the text.\n\n280\n00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.850\nCuz maybe I just for demonstration\nI wanted it a little bit more.\n\n281\n00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.320\nBut where the hanging line, where the next\nline, not the first line, but the hanging\n\n282\n00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.890\nline goes I want that to basically align\nright where that tab stop is right?\n\n283\n00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.550\n>> Right.\n\n284\n00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.890\n>> So you take this, it's very small,\nso that's where you gotta be really.\n\n285\n00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.190\nThe bottom, not the top.\n\n286\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.990\nThe bottom triangle is\nyour hanging indent and\n\n287\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.630\nits hard with my mouse cursor magnified,\ncuz I can't really get it.\n\n288\n00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.185\nThere we go, there we go.\n\n289\n00:14:31.185 --> 00:14:34.120\nSee that tiny little guy right there.\n\n290\n00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.620\nI'm just gonna line it\nright with the tab stop.\n\n291\n00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.690\nAnd there you go.\n\n292\n00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.270\nExactly.\n\n293\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.960\nThe hanging text, not the first.\n\n294\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.550\nThe first line, see right there.\n\n295\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.260\nThe first line is all the way out here.\n\n296\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.560\nI don't wanna indent\nthe first of the line.\n\n297\n00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:54.390\nI want all of the hanging text to\nalign right where that tab stop is and\n\n298\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.100\nthat's exactly what I wan to do.\n\n299\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.510\nSo, that's where you can\nchange your bullets.\n\n300\n00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.760\nNow I just did one right?\n\n301\n00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.208\nThe reason why I did that is because\nonce I get one formatted the right way,\n\n302\n00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:05.200\nI just go ahead and take this.\n\n303\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.500\nOops!\nWrong keyboard!\n\n304\n00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.160\nI'm going to copy this.\n\n305\n00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.360\nAnd that's just control or command C,\nand that's where I go ahead,\n\n306\n00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.520\nwhoops I did the wrong one, sorry.\n\n307\n00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.400\nThere we go, copy, go here.\n\n308\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.220\nYou paste it, okay.\n\n309\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.530\nAnd you can go ahead and paste it here and\nthen it keeps all of the formatting.\n\n310\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.940\nIt actually didn't carry over\nthe paragraph formatting but\n\n311\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.830\nI can still go ahead and\nget that right there.\n\n312\n00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.880\nAnd now I'm going to start getting\ninto my obsessive tweaking so\n\n313\n00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.440\nI should probably stop right now.\n\n314\n00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.470\nBut I think you guys got the idea there.\n\n315\n00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.970\n>> At this time we have\ndifferent tab stops for\n\n316\n00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.540\neach one of those paragraphs, so\nyou got to try to line them up.\n\n317\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.156\n>> Yes, so I was doing it the long way.\n\n318\n00:15:43.156 --> 00:15:44.990\nI should've just really\ntaken all these and\n\n319\n00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.630\nthen just taken all these weird\ntab stops off and just had one.\n\n320\n00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.240\nAnd then now it controls the tab for\nall of them, I can do that.\n\n321\n00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.520\nSecond line indent right there.\n\n322\n00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.236\nI can't grab it with my magnifier.\n\n323\n00:15:56.236 --> 00:15:58.105\n[LAUGH] It's really hard.\n\n324\n00:15:58.105 --> 00:16:01.760\nBut it's where I can take and\ndo all of them.\n\n325\n00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.870\nNow the other thing, there we go.\n\n326\n00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.050\nI got it, perfect.\n\n327\n00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.350\nThere, so now, that will line\nup maybe just a little bit more.\n\n328\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.510\nOkay, I need to stop tweaking.\n\n329\n00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.260\nI think you guys get the point, okay.\n\n330\n00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.660\nYou get the idea, the concept.\n\n331\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.050\nThe hanging and the tab, you get one,\nyou can select all of them.\n\n332\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.250\nYou can format your tabs.\n\n333\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.840\nThe reason I was doing one, is usually\ntake the same amount of text and\n\n334\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.550\npaste it down and change up text.\n\n335\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.450\nThat's usually how I do it.\n\n336\n00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.400\nSo I was combining two\ntechniques of what I do in one.\n\n337\n00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.632\n>> Love those shortcuts.\n\n338\n00:16:26.632 --> 00:16:27.503\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n339\n00:16:27.503 --> 00:16:29.350\n[LAUGH] So now I've got that.\n\n340\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.480\nAnd again right here this is\nthe same idea you can go ahead and\n\n341\n00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.138\nchange where you want.\n\n342\n00:16:34.138 --> 00:16:36.790\nThe tab stop to go for\neach one of these and\n\n343\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.650\nthen change that little line,\nthe hanging indent to line up.\n\n344\n00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.840\nAnd there you go.\n\n345\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.030\nCuz maybe you like that bullet,\nand that's fine.\n\n346\n00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.710\n>> Now this is the text that you\nbrought in from the other program.\n\n347\n00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.860\nDid that tab stop come in with it?\n\n348\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.960\nIt was already there or\ndid you have to add that tab stop?\n\n349\n00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.850\n>> The tab character or\n\n350\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.490\nthe actual keystroke of I added a tab,\nthat came over.\n\n351\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.670\nBecause that's actually what\nMicrosoft Word does automatically.\n\n352\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.470\nAs soon as you select paragraphs and\nadd bullets.\n\n353\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.760\nIt's adding a tab in there.\n\n354\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.337\n>> It puts a glyph and a tab in there and\n\n355\n00:17:06.337 --> 00:17:10.050\nthen you just have to add your tab stop\nonce you've put it into Illustrator.\n\n356\n00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:15.110\n>> Correct, yes, that tab was\nbrought in from where it came from.\n\n357\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.130\nAs opposed to me in the first\none having to manually add this.\n\n358\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.150\nThis is what came over\nI've already got it.\n\n359\n00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.488\nNow I just kinda format it cuz\nmaybe I like the tiny little dot.\n\n360\n00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:25.300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n361\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.844\n>> I think the hearts would\nbe a little more cute, so.\n\n362\n00:17:27.844 --> 00:17:31.280\n[LAUGH] All right, and\nthat's tabs and bullets.\n\n363\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.090\n>> Fantastic look at some\ntechniques that we can use to add\n\n364\n00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.730\nthat level of formatting to our documents,\nwe end up with a lot of lists.\n\n365\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.940\nA lot of times we have unordered\nlists that just use those bullets.\n\n366\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.670\nSo we got a whole panel of glyphs\nthat we can throw in there.\n\n367\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.294\nAnd a great look at using those tab\nstops and how we've got our left,\n\n368\n00:17:48.294 --> 00:17:51.570\ncenter, right-aligned tab\nstops our decimal tab stops.\n\n369\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.070\nAnd really how easy they\nare to work with other\n\n370\n00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.695\nthan the fact that they're really small.\n\n371\n00:17:55.695 --> 00:17:58.660\n[LAUGH] So\nbreak out the magnifying glass for that.\n\n372\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.140\nWe thank you, Vonne, for\nall those fantastic demonstrations.\n\n373\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.420\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n374\n00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.820\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n375\n00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.109\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n376\n00:18:08.109 --> 00:18:15.792\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.746\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.034\nAnd today we're doing\nAdobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:22.601\nAnd specifically in this\nepisode we're gonna be\n\n6\n00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:25.300\nlooking at image resolution\nas well as file types.\n\n7\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.650\nThese are some important concepts when\nwe're working within Illustrator,\n\n8\n00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710\nas well as when you're\nworking with other programs.\n\n9\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.800\nSo here to help us with\nthat is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.500\nHow you doing, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.620\n>> Wonderful.\n\n12\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.760\nExcited to talk to you about the world\nof image resolution and file types.\n\n13\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.110\nThis is a core concept.\n\n14\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.640\nThis is like Design 101.\n\n15\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.930\nSomething that whether you're doing print,\nweb, video, it goes across the board.\n\n16\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.830\nSo this is very important to understand\n\n17\n00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.290\nwhy you want to use a JPEG\nversus a gif versus a tif.\n\n18\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.730\nWe're gonna talk about all that\nresolution and what these numbers mean,\n\n19\n00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.140\nand this is again very important for\nwhen you're done.\n\n20\n00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.490\nWhere am I going, what is my end result?\n\n21\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.590\nAm I designing for print?\n\n22\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.920\nAm I designing for web?\n\n23\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.310\nAm I designing for both?\n\n24\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.240\nAnd going back to how you actually\nbuild your presentations,\n\n25\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.830\nyour brochures,\nwhatever medium that you're working with,\n\n26\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.160\nit all kinda stems from\nknowing the basics.\n\n27\n00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.650\nSo I have a handout,\nif you wanna say, a guide for\n\n28\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.280\nus to go along on our journey\nthrough resolution and file types.\n\n29\n00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.070\nSo, you can see our wonderful title.\n\n30\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.460\nAnd the word resolution, so\nnormally when you think of resolution,\n\n31\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.150\nwhat do you think of when you think\nof the word resolution in general?\n\n32\n00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.727\n>> In general,\nit's a solution to a problem.\n\n33\n00:01:40.727 --> 00:01:43.255\n>> [LAUGH] That's an interesting response.\n\n34\n00:01:43.255 --> 00:01:46.220\n>> [LAUGH] If you take it out of\nthe world of computers, right?\n\n35\n00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.750\nTo resolve something, it's the resolution.\n\n36\n00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.060\nYou want to stick with computers?\n\n37\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.942\n>> Okay, I'll give you that one.\n\n38\n00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:54.450\nAll right, so let's talk about when you\nthink of it in the world of computers.\n\n39\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.020\n>> I always think of mine,\nmy screen resolution, right?\n\n40\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.440\nHow detailed or\nhow many pixels I'm fitting on my screen.\n\n41\n00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.080\n>> That works, and then maybe\nwhen we're talking about images,\n\n42\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.840\nanother concept you wanna say\nthat comes up when resolution,\n\n43\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.845\nI would always get people\nthat say quality or clarity.\n\n44\n00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:18.956\nYeah, cuz it's we talk about TVs and\nour images, like high resolution TVs and\n\n45\n00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:23.060\nyou've got these clear thingies and\nand pixelly things, right?\n\n46\n00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.980\n>> Right, absolutely.\n\n47\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.860\n>> Yeah.\nAnd so the more the better, right?\n\n48\n00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.000\n>> That's what I always thought.\n\n49\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.320\n>> Yeah, and that's kind of what in\na general speak people think of,\n\n50\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.285\nis resolution equals quality.\n\n51\n00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:39.490\nAnd while it's true, when we're\ntalking in the world of images and\n\n52\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.230\nusing them within a design area,\n\n53\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.874\nin a sense it means something\na little bit different, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:52.340\nSo, in this sense resolution\nreally means pixels per inch.\n\n55\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.030\nHow many pixels are in an inch,\nand what that means for\n\n56\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.435\nwhether using the medium of web or\nprint, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:05.080\nCuz that's probably something where if\nyou've ever, maybe back in the day,\n\n58\n00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.652\nmaybe not as much any more cause,\nI mean, who uses printers, all right?\n\n59\n00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:10.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't have a printer at home.\n\n60\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.940\nBut you would take a picture and\nyou'd print it.\n\n61\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.900\nIt might look this big on the screen,\nbut when you print it,\n\n62\n00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.250\nit looks like this big, right?\n\n63\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.060\n>> Yes.\n>> Or you put it into a PowerPoint and\n\n64\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.810\nit looks all weird, it looks all pixelated\nand the quality doesn't look so good.\n\n65\n00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.110\nIt comes down to the resolution.\n\n66\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.510\nAnd not just resolution, it also talks\nabout the total number of pixels and\n\n67\n00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.520\nthe image dimensions.\n\n68\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.772\nSo I'm gonna try to spell it all out for\nyou and\n\n69\n00:03:35.772 --> 00:03:39.600\nkind of show you those different things\nof, yeah, I know where that happened.\n\n70\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.050\nWhy that happened.\n\n71\n00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.050\nNow you'll understand why.\n\n72\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.575\n>> Awesome-\n>> Yes.\n\n73\n00:03:43.575 --> 00:03:44.820\n>> Looking forward to it.\n\n74\n00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.680\n>> So, you have here,\nI've got resolution is pixels per inch.\n\n75\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.600\nSometimes you can also refer to it as dpi,\nwhich is dots per inch.\n\n76\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.140\nWhen you're using dpi,\nthat technically is reserved for printers.\n\n77\n00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.590\nPrinters print in dots of ink and\nhow many dots are together.\n\n78\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.420\nSo dpi is really a printer thing, ppi,\n\n79\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.650\npixels per inch,\nis when you're talking about images.\n\n80\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.780\nImages have pixels, they don't have dots.\n\n81\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.250\nBut, you know what,\nit's such a loose term.\n\n82\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.050\nI've heard people say,\nI have a 300 dpi image.\n\n83\n00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.270\nThat's fine, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.960\n>> Right.\n>> We're not gonna get that technical,\n\n85\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.082\nit all means basically the same thing.\n\n86\n00:04:21.082 --> 00:04:26.180\nSo, but again, like I said, the total\nnumber of pixels that are occupying that\n\n87\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.680\nfile, that's what is\nthe most important because\n\n88\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.050\nyou have to have enough to work with\nto get to the place you want to go.\n\n89\n00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.090\nMore on that when we get to\nimage resolution for printing.\n\n90\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.140\nAnd it's really all about knowing the\nright file type for the medium, like I've\n\n91\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.570\nsaid I think a couple times so far, so\nI think we're driving home that point.\n\n92\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.580\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n\n93\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.340\nlet's move on to those different\nmediums that we're working in.\n\n94\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.590\nAre we working in web, or\nare we working in print?\n\n95\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.780\nAnd the kind of baseline,\n\n96\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.660\nthis is what all designers know,\nit's 72 for web, 300 for print.\n\n97\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.800\nThat's just what it is.\n\n98\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.880\nSo if you are sending files to\na commercial printer to get your\n\n99\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.160\nad printed in a magazine or just a flyer,\n\n100\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.360\nthey will require you to have\nimages of 300 ppi, most places,\n\n101\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.740\nalways check the specs for wherever your\ngoing, but this is just a general rule.\n\n102\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.530\nAnd those color modes.\n\n103\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.350\nWe talked a lot about color in some\nother episodes, RGB versus CMYK.\n\n104\n00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.710\nThe red, green, and blue versus the cyan,\nmagenta, yellow, and black.\n\n105\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.310\nSo having the images in the right\ncolor modes is important.\n\n106\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.685\nAnd then the file types that\nare associated with each medium.\n\n107\n00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:36.726\nJPEG, GIF, PNG, and\nSVGs over there on the web side.\n\n108\n00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:40.880\nEPS, PDF and\nTIFF files over there on the print side.\n\n109\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.360\nAnd the most important thing in printing\nis making sure you have the right\n\n110\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.799\nresolution and\nmaking sure you have the right color mode,\n\n111\n00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:54.361\nbecause the whole light versus inks,\nand inks don't talk in light numbers,\n\n112\n00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:58.042\nyou have to make sure they're\nin ink numbers, that's CMYK.\n\n113\n00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:03.079\nAnd then making sure you have\nenough pixels within a physical\n\n114\n00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:09.100\nsquare inch that will print at a high\nenough quality on a piece of a paper,\n\n115\n00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.590\nor whatever device, not device-\n>> Medium.\n\n116\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.530\n>> Medium, thank you.\n\n117\n00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.990\nBecause you can print on plastic,\n\n118\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.730\nthey actually have synthetic paper\nthat's not made of paper at all.\n\n119\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.520\n>> That's pretty cool.\n\n120\n00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.583\n>> Yeah, it's pretty neat, actually.\n\n121\n00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:23.008\n[LAUGH] But\nthat's because I'm a print nerd.\n\n122\n00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:26.281\n[LAUGH] And then over on the web side,\nit's honestly,\n\n123\n00:06:26.281 --> 00:06:31.390\nif you're talking in realistic terms,\nit's not really about the resolution.\n\n124\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.730\nIt's really about the image dimensions.\n\n125\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.180\nHow many pixels do you have width and\n\n126\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.380\nheight, because if you're putting\nan image on a website and\n\n127\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.890\nthe space that you have to occupy\nthe image is 500 pixels over 300 pixels,\n\n128\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.750\nthat's the measurement that you're talking\nalready, that's what really matters.\n\n129\n00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.800\nBecause pixels per square inch, we're\nnot talking about inches on a screen.\n\n130\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.270\nWe're just talking about actual pixels,\npixel-to-pixels, so\n\n131\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.120\nthat's what really matters.\n\n132\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.960\nSo that's why I'm saying image\ndimensions in width and height, and\n\n133\n00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.360\nthen also making sure you\nhave the right file type,\n\n134\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.400\nbecause it all comes back to the file\nsize cuz you want that fast load time.\n\n135\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.400\nYou want pictures to come up\non your website like that, and\n\n136\n00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.570\ndo you want transparency\nversus not transparency?\n\n137\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.520\nSo, that's where we get into the next\npart of understanding file formats.\n\n138\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.109\nWhat is the different between a .jpg and\n\n139\n00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:25.130\na .gif, or I've actually read\nsomething that it is pronounced jiff.\n\n140\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.910\n>> Yes.\n>> The creator,\n\n141\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.290\ndo you remember that article?\n\n142\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.960\n>> That was pretty neat.\n\n143\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.380\n>> The actual inventor of the file format\ncame, and this was like, it was just\n\n144\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.880\nrecently, the last couple years, it's like\nno, it is not pronounced GIF, it is a JIF.\n\n145\n00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.550\n>> Cuz they made the joke around the\noffice JIFs are for choosy developers or\n\n146\n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.230\nsomething like that.\n\n147\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.090\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because of the peanut\n\n148\n00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.870\nbutter commercial.\n\n149\n00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.840\n>> Yeah.\nIt kind\n\n150\n00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.710\nof correlates all back to that when\nhe was making his file format so.\n\n151\n00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.670\n>> I say GIF.\n\n152\n00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.239\n>> I do too.\n\n153\n00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:55.520\n>> I've heard people say JIF and\nI'm like that's not how you say it, but\n\n154\n00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.247\nI don't know.\n\n155\n00:07:56.247 --> 00:07:59.165\n[LAUGH] From the creator's\nmouth it is JIF.\n\n156\n00:07:59.165 --> 00:08:00.533\n>> Yeah.\n\n157\n00:08:00.533 --> 00:08:01.507\nBut I'm gonna keep saying it.\n\n158\n00:08:01.507 --> 00:08:03.091\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n159\n00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:07.830\nwhat is the difference between a .JPG and\na .GIF?\n\n160\n00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.030\nWhy would I want to use one\nversus the other in a web format?\n\n161\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.845\nWell, it's what the file format supports.\n\n162\n00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:20.660\n.JPGs do not support transparency but\nthey do have a high color support,\n\n163\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.150\nthey can support up to 16 million\ncolors and that's why you\n\n164\n00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.970\nwant to use that mostly for photos because\nyour photos have the wide range of colors.\n\n165\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.530\nYou want to have as many\ncolor support as possible.\n\n166\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.260\nAnd then you don't have any layers in a\n.JPG which is going to come into more when\n\n167\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.890\nyou get into do you want to have layers in\na Photoshop file versus a flattened .JPG.\n\n168\n00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.720\nSo it doesn't support layers, so\nit's always gonna be that way.\n\n169\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.740\nAnd it has a lossy compression on it.\n\n170\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.170\nWhat that means is anytime that you take\na .JPG an you, if you're in Photoshop,\n\n171\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.880\nyou make it into a .JPG and\nthen you save it and\n\n172\n00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.350\nclose it and put it away,\nthe file format compresses it down.\n\n173\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.730\nAnd that's why it's a good file format for\n\n174\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.180\nfast load time with a lot of color\nsupports because of that compression.\n\n175\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.160\nNow, if you take a .JPG and open it,\nchange it, save it, close it, open it,\n\n176\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.310\nchange it, like hundreds and\nhundreds of times,\n\n177\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.680\nyou are going to get a degradation in\nquality because every time it compresses,\n\n178\n00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.620\nit's almost like pixels pop out.\n\n179\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.919\n>> It's throwing away data,\n\n180\n00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:24.687\nthe idea of compressing it like\nwe do with computer files,\n\n181\n00:09:24.687 --> 00:09:28.970\nis you're taking out the extra running\nspace to make the files less, smaller.\n\n182\n00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.259\nBut, that means in an image,\nless detail in the image.\n\n183\n00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:34.380\nI would think.\n>> Yeah, exactly yeah.\n\n184\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.774\nIt's the whole idea of compression.\n\n185\n00:09:36.774 --> 00:09:38.061\n>> You're losing information.\n\n186\n00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:42.670\n>> Yeah and it's not like huge amounts\nof information but if you do it lots and\n\n187\n00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.880\nlots of times,\nI mean you have to do this a lot before,\n\n188\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.798\nyou're going to see any\nreal visual quality.\n\n189\n00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:50.290\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So it's okay to do it a few times,\n\n190\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.965\nas I'm working on a project, I don't have\nto worry about, gosh, I can't say this but\n\n191\n00:09:53.965 --> 00:09:55.810\nonce the whole time I'm working on it.\n\n192\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.370\n>> Correct, yeah.\n\n193\n00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.000\nAnd I mean, and that's where if you're\nviewing it, like in a picture viewer,\n\n194\n00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.920\nthat's completely different.\n\n195\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.830\n>> Right.\n>> I'm talking about,\n\n196\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.970\nyou're opening it up in Photoshop, you're\ndoing something to it, you're saving it,\n\n197\n00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.460\nand then you're closing it back down.\n\n198\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:05.960\n>> Okay.\n\n199\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.110\n>> So it's not just opening it to view it,\nit's the editing\n\n200\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.200\nin a photo editing software such as\nPhotoshop that you would have that.\n\n201\n00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.320\n>> Loss.\n>> Yeah that loss,\n\n202\n00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.570\nif it was ever to happen, okay?\n\n203\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.280\nAnd you probably would never notice it.\n\n204\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.270\nBut as a concept that's what it does,\nokay?\n\n205\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.030\nAnd it does support RGB and\nCMYK color modes.\n\n206\n00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.421\nAnd you can have whatever\nresolutions you want.\n\n207\n00:10:28.421 --> 00:10:36.128\nIt's again what does the format itself\nallow it to hold in it's container.\n\n208\n00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:39.470\nIn a .GIF container or\nfile format it only supports 256 colors,\n\n209\n00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.400\nso you can see right there\nthat's a huge difference.\n\n210\n00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.780\nSo that's something you\nwant to reserve .GIFs for\n\n211\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.610\nlike flat color line arts, stuff that\nis not necessarily a photograph.\n\n212\n00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.130\nNow does that mean,\nyou can have a photograph as a .GIF.\n\n213\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.900\nI'm not saying you can't.\n\n214\n00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.260\nWhat do you want it to do and how do\nyou want it to show if you want to say.\n\n215\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.410\nJust the basics of file formats.\n\n216\n00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.980\nAnd .GIFs can support transparency.\n\n217\n00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.920\nHave you ever, I would always do this back\nin the day before I knew what all this\n\n218\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.430\nstuff was, you put a picture that\nyou found into a PowerPoint or\n\n219\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.750\na Word or some file, it doesn't matter.\n\n220\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.690\nYou put it somewhere and\nit has that white background.\n\n221\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.707\n>> Yes.\n>> You know what I'm talking about?\n\n222\n00:11:20.707 --> 00:11:21.360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n223\n00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.470\nI would always do it in PowerPoint,\nand I didn't understand.\n\n224\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.275\nAnd I see people doing that,\nI'm like that's a .JPG.\n\n225\n00:11:27.275 --> 00:11:28.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You didn't get a .GIF.\n\n226\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.664\nBut then other, especially with Clipart,\n\n227\n00:11:30.664 --> 00:11:33.438\nyou can actually have images\nthat have that transparency.\n\n228\n00:11:33.438 --> 00:11:37.002\nSo you put it against like a blue\ncolored background in a slide and\n\n229\n00:11:37.002 --> 00:11:40.434\nyou don't the outline, or\nyou don't see that white box, and\n\n230\n00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:43.270\nthen other images you\ndo see the white box.\n\n231\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:43.921\nWhy?\n\n232\n00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:45.950\nIt's the file format.\n\n233\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:46.998\nSo-\n>> Makes sense now.\n\n234\n00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:48.307\n>> There you go.\n\n235\n00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:50.330\n[LAUGH] That's why I'm here.\n\n236\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.340\nSo back to here,\nwe have the .GIF of the 256,\n\n237\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.870\nthe transparency, but if you're starting\nto get more into comparing, contrasting,\n\n238\n00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.610\nokay, .JPG no transparency,\n.GIF yes transparency.\n\n239\n00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.990\nBut then,\nyou kinda get into a .PNG as versus and\n\n240\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:10.580\nI'm just gonna kinda go down to let you\nknow that in one type of .PNG format\n\n241\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.030\nyou have transparencies but\nthere's different levels of transparency.\n\n242\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.050\nAnd that's where you talk about indexed\ntransparency and alpha transparency.\n\n243\n00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.290\n>> Hm.\n\n244\n00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.420\n>> Breaking it down,\nindex transparency means it's either on or\n\n245\n00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.900\noff, you don't have any in betweens.\n\n246\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.390\nThere's not semi-transparency.\n\n247\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.210\n>> Opacity.\n\n248\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.780\n>> Opacity, transparency.\n\n249\n00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.420\nSee through-ness.\n\n250\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.433\nHow about we go with that?\n>> See through-ness, I like that.\n\n251\n00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:31.248\n>> See through-ness.\n\n252\n00:12:31.248 --> 00:12:33.332\n[LAUGH] So it's either on or\n\n253\n00:12:33.332 --> 00:12:38.750\noff with transparency in an indexed\n.GIF format or in a .PNG 24.\n\n254\n00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.180\nI'll come back to that in a sec.\n\n255\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.920\nThat's an alpha.\n\n256\n00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.360\nSo if you had like a transitioning\n\n257\n00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.640\nopacity level where it's kind of\nfading out like blurred edges or\n\n258\n00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.200\nsomething like that, .GIF would just,\nit would be white until it's off.\n\n259\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.468\nAnd I can show you examples when we\nget into some places where I can\n\n260\n00:12:57.468 --> 00:12:58.100\ndemonstrate it.\n\n261\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.700\nBut on or off for .GIF.\n\n262\n00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:06.083\n.PNG 24s it's the different levels,\neight bit transparency for\n\n263\n00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:09.440\n.PNGs versus a one bit transparency for.\n\n264\n00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.310\n>> .GIFs.\n>> .GIFs thank you.\n\n265\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:17.320\nSo all right, so keeping on going down\nwith these different file formats.\n\n266\n00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.878\nSo this .PNG.\n\n267\n00:13:18.878 --> 00:13:21.570\n.PNGs have become really popular.\n\n268\n00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.820\nI see that everywhere, so\nit's a very common file format but\n\n269\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.075\nthere's two levels,\nif you wanna say, of .PNG.\n\n270\n00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:33.025\nA .PNG 8 is exactly like a .GIF.\n\n271\n00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:34.105\nIt has the exact same thing.\n\n272\n00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:35.095\nYou can see.\n\n273\n00:13:35.095 --> 00:13:40.014\nI pretty much just copied pasted the\ndescription from .GIF to .PNG 8 because\n\n274\n00:13:40.014 --> 00:13:41.665\nthey're the same thing.\n\n275\n00:13:42.973 --> 00:13:44.195\nBut the .PNG 24,\n\n276\n00:13:44.195 --> 00:13:48.245\nthat's where you really get,\nit's almost like the best of both worlds.\n\n277\n00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:53.030\nYou get all the color\nsupport of a .JPG file and\n\n278\n00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.610\nthe transparency of a .GIF\nmarried into one file format.\n\n279\n00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.320\nSo that's why everyone was super\nexcited when .PNGs came along.\n\n280\n00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.210\nIt's like, it's the best of both worlds,\nI've got all of this.\n\n281\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.340\nBut it does need to be a .PNG 24,\nnot a .PNG 8.\n\n282\n00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.088\n>> We cannot see that\nfrom the file extension.\n\n283\n00:14:07.088 --> 00:14:10.200\n>> Correct, yes,\nit's just going to say .PNG.\n\n284\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.680\nSo you do not really know that one way or\nthe other.\n\n285\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.510\nI guess the only thing that you could\nsee if you did have a file that\n\n286\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.230\nwas showing that varying degrees\nof transparency like you\n\n287\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.540\ncould kind of see through parts of it but\nnot you could visibly see it.\n\n288\n00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.800\nBut yes, from just looking at it there,\nthat's fine.\n\n289\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.109\nAnd if you wanna go one more step, there\nwas an Adobe product called Fireworks,\n\n290\n00:14:33.109 --> 00:14:36.980\nwhich I used to love\nworking in back in the day.\n\n291\n00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.240\nAnd the native file format for\nFireworks was a .PNG.\n\n292\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.271\nBut it was an extended .PNG.\n\n293\n00:14:42.271 --> 00:14:48.020\nA Fireworks .PNG file is not the same\nas a flattened image .PNG file.\n\n294\n00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.510\nSo, yeah, by just looking in your file\nlist, you wouldn't have any idea.\n\n295\n00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.430\n>> They would all look the same.\n\n296\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.630\n>> Yeah, so it's like that extra level\nof Fireworks .PNG having layers and\n\n297\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:02.380\nthe actual formats of that particular\napplication to that file extension.\n\n298\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.090\nSo yeah, but very good point to go with.\n\n299\n00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:10.550\nYou can't know this by just looking\nat it in a list, so all right.\n\n300\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.100\nWonderful.\n\n301\n00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.450\nSo let's go over to\nthe print side quickly.\n\n302\n00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.530\nWell not necessarily quickly,\nbut we're just gonna go.\n\n303\n00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.400\n.TIFFs, okay.\n\n304\n00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.850\nTag Image File Format.\n\n305\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.640\nAnd I forgot to actually tell you\nwhat all of these actually mean.\n\n306\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.770\nBut .TIFF is a Tag Image File Format and\nthat is a raster file\n\n307\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:33.870\nformat that is reserved for\nPhotographs for print, normally.\n\n308\n00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.580\nWhy?\nWhy wouldn't I use a .JPG in a print\n\n309\n00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.210\nbecause it can support CMYK and you said\nit can do whatever image resolution.\n\n310\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.885\nThat's right, but the main thing here is\nthat .TIFF file formats as opposed to\n\n311\n00:15:44.885 --> 00:15:48.000\n.JPGs do not have compression\non it by default.\n\n312\n00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.590\nLike it keeps all of the information and\nprinting and using files for print.\n\n313\n00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.948\nYou always want to keep as\nmuch information as possible.\n\n314\n00:15:54.948 --> 00:16:00.066\nSo that's like the big\ndifferentiator between .JPGs and\n\n315\n00:16:00.066 --> 00:16:04.041\n.TIFFs in the concept of using it for\nprint.\n\n316\n00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:05.025\nSo there's no compression.\n\n317\n00:16:05.025 --> 00:16:09.517\nYou can put compression on a .TIFF file,\nit uses an LZ dub LZW algorithm,\n\n318\n00:16:09.517 --> 00:16:11.627\nwhich is a lossless compression.\n\n319\n00:16:11.627 --> 00:16:14.262\nThis is getting probably way\nmore than you need to know, but\n\n320\n00:16:14.262 --> 00:16:15.694\nit does come up in your options.\n\n321\n00:16:15.694 --> 00:16:20.207\nSo just,\nTIFFs can do no compression by default.\n\n322\n00:16:20.207 --> 00:16:24.750\nAnd it does have layer support,\nwhich doesn't go with a .JPG.\n\n323\n00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:29.310\nI'm saying limited layer support because\nit doesn't have the full extension of\n\n324\n00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.630\nlayers that you would have like\na Photoshop file format, but\n\n325\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.620\nit will support it.\n\n326\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.390\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n327\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:42.300\nSo you can always kinda bank on .TIFF\nfile format to print, .JPG for web.\n\n328\n00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.500\nThere you go.\n\n329\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.178\nAnd I put this guy over here,\nbecause if I'm using Illustrator,\n\n330\n00:16:48.178 --> 00:16:53.610\nand or InDesign, and I am doing images for\n\n331\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.470\na brochure, I usually keep them\nall in the Photoshop file format.\n\n332\n00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.640\nI keep them in its, to me, a native file\nformat because I can do different things\n\n333\n00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:08.530\nwith placing and\nimporting Photoshop documents into other\n\n334\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:13.410\nAdobe applications, and I can have\na lot more options and flexibility.\n\n335\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.080\nSo that's what i would normally do.\n\n336\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.390\nSo I just kinda threw that in\nthere over on the print side,\n\n337\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.984\nbecause when you're using it with\nother applications it does have some\n\n338\n00:17:20.984 --> 00:17:25.360\noptions that you would wanna have.\n\n339\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.549\nAnd then I also put over here,\nof images for print side .EPS,\n\n340\n00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:34.225\nEncapsulated PostScript file,\nwhich we've talked about from what\n\n341\n00:17:34.225 --> 00:17:38.870\nvector images in general,\nthat's just a vector file format.\n\n342\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:44.550\nAnd Illustrator, specifically, you can\nopen an .EPS file, you can modify it,\n\n343\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:49.380\ndo whatever you want with it, because\nthat is a more native vector file format.\n\n344\n00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.360\nIt supports vector information.\n\n345\n00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.730\nAll of these guys over here, all the web\nones, those are all raster file formats.\n\n346\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.520\nWell, that's besides .SVG.\n\n347\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.665\nBut the ones up here, .JPEG, .GIF,\n\n348\n00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:04.656\n.PNG, those are all raster,\n.TIFF is raster, EPS is Vector, okay.\n\n349\n00:18:04.656 --> 00:18:09.300\nAnd so, putting logos or even images,\n\n350\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.050\nreally, I don't necessarily put images\nin .EPS file format, but you can.\n\n351\n00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.240\nIt does support the vector information,\nand so that's why I would have somebody\n\n352\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:25.020\nsend me an .EPS file, not an .AI file,\ncuz the version support and everything.\n\n353\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.140\nI can put it in my publication and\ndo whatever I want with it,\n\n354\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.430\nso .EPS is kind of more on the print side.\n\n355\n00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.470\nYou don't put ,EPS files in a website,\nit just doesn't work, okay?\n\n356\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.700\nAnd then I also have PDF.\n\n357\n00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:40.590\nYou can send an image, a logo, an ad,\n\n358\n00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:45.540\nwhatever you want in a PDF format\nbecause that's more on the print side,\n\n359\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.140\nI guess, but\nit does support vector and raster.\n\n360\n00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.540\nLike I said, it's print or\nweb because PDFs have, again,\n\n361\n00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.520\nthat kind of extra extension\nif you want to say.\n\n362\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:19:00.779\nOr just the capability of being a web\nresolution PDF and a print resolution PDF.\n\n363\n00:19:00.779 --> 00:19:04.909\nAnd PDF is a very common format\nthat you use for end result,\n\n364\n00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:07.447\nfor your brochures, or anything.\n\n365\n00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:10.002\nFor printing, mostly,\nbut it can go for web.\n\n366\n00:19:10.002 --> 00:19:15.570\nAnd that's that 300 versus 72\nwhen working different mediums.\n\n367\n00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:21.300\nSo, and just really quickly,\nover on the website again, SVG.\n\n368\n00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.860\nSVG, a Scalable Vector Graphic,\nthis is a newer file\n\n369\n00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:32.020\nformat in the sense that it is\na vector file format for the web.\n\n370\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:32.760\n>> Hm.\n\n371\n00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.742\n>> And it keeps that\nresolution-independent quality to where\n\n372\n00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:39.639\nyou could make it bigger, make it smaller.\n\n373\n00:19:39.639 --> 00:19:46.280\nIt is all XML based, its standard now,\nand at this point in the game, it is.\n\n374\n00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.750\nIt's okay to use SVG's, but\n\n375\n00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:53.555\nit has a lot more than just an image\nfile format, it goes way deeper.\n\n376\n00:19:53.555 --> 00:19:59.120\nIt has all these things with animation,\ninteractivity, and\n\n377\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.840\nyou see it a lot on smartphones and\ndesigning for that.\n\n378\n00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.440\nSo it is a up and coming,\nif you want to say.\n\n379\n00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.965\nIt's been up and coming for\na very long time.\n\n380\n00:20:07.965 --> 00:20:11.440\n[LAUGH] But it's getting there and\nit's advancing.\n\n381\n00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.155\nAnd if you just kinda search around\nthe web, just history of SVG,\n\n382\n00:20:16.155 --> 00:20:19.530\nit has tons of information\non what it can do.\n\n383\n00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.334\nSo I wanted to put that in there,\nbecause it is valid.\n\n384\n00:20:23.334 --> 00:20:27.081\nAnd kinda going back to the Adobe ACA or\n\n385\n00:20:27.081 --> 00:20:32.360\nACE test questions,\nyou could have that on the test.\n\n386\n00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.270\nBut it's more of like what is it?\n\n387\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.500\nCan you export it?\n\n388\n00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.870\nAnd there's an SVG 1.0 and\nthere's a SVG tiny format.\n\n389\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.840\nYou don't have to know it super in-depth,\nenough to know that it exists.\n\n390\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.510\nSo that's why I wanted to\nput it on this tutorial.\n\n391\n00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.760\n>> Tell you what, can you go back then and\n\n392\n00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.300\ngo through the ones that\nwe did at the beginning?\n\n393\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.980\nCuz we didn't define those acronyms.\n\n394\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.790\n>> I did say that.\n\n395\n00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.080\nThank you for keeping me on that.\n\n396\n00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.517\nAll right, so yes.\n\n397\n00:20:55.517 --> 00:20:58.115\nSo .JPEG, do you know some of these?\n\n398\n00:20:58.115 --> 00:20:59.499\n>> Maybe.\n\n399\n00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:01.297\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna quiz you and\n\n400\n00:21:01.297 --> 00:21:01.969\nput you on the spot again.\n\n401\n00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:02.666\n>> Okay, I'll do it.\n\n402\n00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:04.101\n>> You're like, no!\n[LAUGH] >> Let's do it.\n\n403\n00:21:04.101 --> 00:21:04.950\n>> JPG?\n\n404\n00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.465\n>> Joint Project Group something.\n\n405\n00:21:09.465 --> 00:21:11.887\n>> Joint Photographic Experts Group.\n\n406\n00:21:11.887 --> 00:21:14.316\nCuz it is-\n>> Joint Photographic Expert Group.\n\n407\n00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:16.981\n>> Cuz we say JPG, but it is JPEG,\nthere is an e in there.\n\n408\n00:21:16.981 --> 00:21:20.240\n>> Back when we had the four\nletter file extensions.\n\n409\n00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.610\n>> Yes, so\nit is Joint Photographic Experts Group.\n\n410\n00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.579\n>> Okay.\n\n411\n00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:25.897\n>> .GIF.\n>> So half a point for that one?\n\n412\n00:21:25.897 --> 00:21:26.753\n>> We'll give you that.\n\n413\n00:21:26.753 --> 00:21:27.361\n>> Okay.\n\n414\n00:21:27.361 --> 00:21:31.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> GIF is a, I do not know,\n\n415\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:36.590\nsomething interchange,\nGraphics Interchange Format.\n\n416\n00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.400\n>> Yes.\n>> Yes.\n\n417\n00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.010\n>> It is.\n\n418\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:38.809\nYes, perfect.\n\n419\n00:21:38.809 --> 00:21:39.900\n[LAUGH]\n>> That was a close one.\n\n420\n00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.855\nI knew it was in there somewhere.\n\n421\n00:21:40.855 --> 00:21:43.525\n[LAUGH]\n>> You get a full point for that one.\n\n422\n00:21:43.525 --> 00:21:44.437\n>> Okay.\n\n423\n00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:46.146\n>> .PNG?\n\n424\n00:21:46.146 --> 00:21:50.435\n>> It's Photo Neutral,\nno I do not know that one.\n\n425\n00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:52.443\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Negative.\n\n426\n00:21:52.443 --> 00:21:53.386\n>> [LAUGH] That is a-\n>> There's a negative in there somewhere.\n\n427\n00:21:53.386 --> 00:21:54.554\n>> Portable Network Graphic.\n\n428\n00:21:54.554 --> 00:21:56.266\n>> Portable Network Graphic,\nnot even close.\n\n429\n00:21:56.266 --> 00:21:57.770\n>> Yes.\n>> Portable Network Graphic.\n\n430\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:58.375\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay.\n\n431\n00:21:58.375 --> 00:22:01.267\n>> [LAUGH] And\nSVG is a Scalable Vector Graphic.\n\n432\n00:22:01.267 --> 00:22:03.470\n>> Okay, I get that one,\nI was listening to you.\n\n433\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.587\n>> Good.\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I already said that.\n\n434\n00:22:04.587 --> 00:22:06.082\n>> Yeah.\n\n435\n00:22:06.082 --> 00:22:10.905\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, so the other\nbiggest point to make about images,\n\n436\n00:22:10.905 --> 00:22:15.914\nin any of our products,\nis understanding how to resize images,\n\n437\n00:22:15.914 --> 00:22:18.602\nand you gotta start with a lot, and\n\n438\n00:22:18.602 --> 00:22:24.200\nyou want to always take away,\nyou don't want to add, okay?\n\n439\n00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.675\nThe definition of what resampling means,\n\n440\n00:22:26.675 --> 00:22:30.328\nresampling means changing\nthe total number of pixels, okay.\n\n441\n00:22:30.328 --> 00:22:34.569\nAnd in theory, if you're doing all\nof this in theory, by the books,\n\n442\n00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:38.685\nif the resolution goes up,\nthe width and height goes down, okay.\n\n443\n00:22:38.685 --> 00:22:41.643\nAnd you don't want to change\nthe number of pixels when you're upping\n\n444\n00:22:41.643 --> 00:22:42.718\nthe resolution versus.\n\n445\n00:22:42.718 --> 00:22:45.565\nNow, it's much easier if I demonstrate it,\nso I'll show you that.\n\n446\n00:22:45.565 --> 00:22:49.300\nBut just a quick overview here,\nof sizing per print versus sizing for\n\n447\n00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.710\nweb in Photoshop.\n\n448\n00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.870\nBut this is Illustrator.\n\n449\n00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.342\nBut still, again, you gotta have\nyour graphics and your images in\n\n450\n00:22:55.342 --> 00:22:59.565\nthe right way before you put them into\nyour Illustrator, or InDesign file, so.\n\n451\n00:22:59.565 --> 00:23:02.457\nSo, up the image size, unchecking,\nand then changing the color mode.\n\n452\n00:23:02.457 --> 00:23:07.217\nBut again, it's really resolution,\ncolor mode, file format,\n\n453\n00:23:07.217 --> 00:23:11.300\neverything we've been talking\nabout in this tutorial.\n\n454\n00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.748\nSo, let me just show\nyou something quickly.\n\n455\n00:23:13.748 --> 00:23:15.907\nI keep saying quickly,\nso sorry about that.\n\n456\n00:23:15.907 --> 00:23:16.436\n>> That's okay.\n\n457\n00:23:16.436 --> 00:23:19.504\n>> [LAUGH] I'm just gonna keep going.\n\n458\n00:23:19.504 --> 00:23:22.099\nImages right here, I have some pictures.\n\n459\n00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:25.116\nAnd these came straight from my phone.\n\n460\n00:23:25.116 --> 00:23:28.027\nOkay, so this guy right here,\nthese are my cats.\n\n461\n00:23:28.027 --> 00:23:28.712\n>> Aww.\n\n462\n00:23:28.712 --> 00:23:30.391\n>> This Fuego, Bishop.\n\n463\n00:23:30.391 --> 00:23:33.791\nSo, if I go here,\nI just wanted to show you it and\n\n464\n00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:38.048\nshow you the information,\non a Mac I'm just doing Cmd+I.\n\n465\n00:23:38.048 --> 00:23:41.361\nShow you right here,\nthat it is showing me that the dimensions\n\n466\n00:23:41.361 --> 00:23:44.369\nof my file are 3,000\npixels by 4,000 pixels.\n\n467\n00:23:44.369 --> 00:23:45.498\n>> Wow, nice phone.\n\n468\n00:23:45.498 --> 00:23:46.234\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n469\n00:23:46.234 --> 00:23:49.690\n[LAUGH] Yeah, it actually gives me all\nof the information about what my phone,\n\n470\n00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.028\nthe settings, and\nall that kind of, the f-stops,\n\n471\n00:23:52.028 --> 00:23:54.860\nand back when you actually\nhad to take pictures, right?\n\n472\n00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.155\n>> The EXIF information.\n\n473\n00:23:56.155 --> 00:23:57.162\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n474\n00:23:57.162 --> 00:24:01.014\nSo it's in here, but the most important\nthing is it's starting really big.\n\n475\n00:24:01.014 --> 00:24:03.221\nOkay, because that's\nthe most important thing.\n\n476\n00:24:03.221 --> 00:24:08.058\nLike this would be like a high-resolution\nphotograph in a sense that I could use\n\n477\n00:24:08.058 --> 00:24:11.594\nthis into a lot with it with\nthe many pixels that I have to get\n\n478\n00:24:11.594 --> 00:24:14.624\nthe resolution up to a proper\nprint resolution and\n\n479\n00:24:14.624 --> 00:24:18.900\nstill have enough physical dimensions\nof where it's supposed to go.\n\n480\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:24.190\nSo if this was gonna go on the cover of\nCats R Us magazine, which doesn't exist,\n\n481\n00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:29.010\nbut I wanna make sure that I can\nput that on the cover at the proper\n\n482\n00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:34.130\nprint resolution without creating\ninformation that wasn't there.\n\n483\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.280\nThat's the most important thing.\n\n484\n00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.980\nIf I came over here to this one, right,\n\n485\n00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.750\nthis is him just lounging in the,\nhim and his big catness, so\n\n486\n00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.740\nwe've got here,\nthis is only 800-by-900 pixels.\n\n487\n00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.570\nThat's not as much to work with.\n\n488\n00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.660\nOkay, and back to that whole if\nthe resolution goes up, the width and\n\n489\n00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.320\nheight goes down.\n\n490\n00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.300\nThat's really important.\n\n491\n00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.970\nSo having enough to work with.\n\n492\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:00.500\nIf somebody sends me\na 200-by-200 pixel photograph,\n\n493\n00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.990\nand I'm trying to put this into\na print brochure that's supposed to\n\n494\n00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.620\nbe five inches by five inches, there's no\nway I'm gonna get that information there,\n\n495\n00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.200\nbecause I don't have enough\ninformation to start.\n\n496\n00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.960\nAnd in theory, you don't want to let\nthe computer, or Photoshop, or whatever\n\n497\n00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:21.500\nimage resolution modification program\nyou're using, to increase the pixels.\n\n498\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.160\nYou want to just work\nwith what you've got.\n\n499\n00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.930\nThat being said,\nthese products have gotten a lot better.\n\n500\n00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.297\nThe upsampling,\nif you wanna say, in Photoshop,\n\n501\n00:25:29.297 --> 00:25:33.097\nthe algorithms that it's actually using\nto create the pixels to make information\n\n502\n00:25:33.097 --> 00:25:35.490\nthat's not there has gotten way better.\n\n503\n00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:36.872\n>> So let me make sure I get this right.\n\n504\n00:25:36.872 --> 00:25:40.123\nYou're saying if you started with\nsomething that was 200-by-200,\n\n505\n00:25:40.123 --> 00:25:41.710\nyou needed to get it bigger.\n\n506\n00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:46.030\nThe application, what it's having\nto do is actually create pixels.\n\n507\n00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.210\nAnd by looking at the pixels\nthat are already there and\n\n508\n00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.730\ntry to fill them in and\nit usually doesn't do a very good job.\n\n509\n00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.040\nAnd that's when we get kinda\nthe quality you say goes down.\n\n510\n00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.520\n>> Yeah, it looks blurry.\n\n511\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.860\nBecause adding stuff\nthat it's just deciding,\n\n512\n00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.470\nI think we should add 15 more white\npixels around this one white pixel.\n\n513\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.000\nAnd it might not actually show up.\n\n514\n00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.794\nBut again, this can happen.\n\n515\n00:26:07.794 --> 00:26:11.963\nAnd Photoshop has gotten way better\nat their upsampling algorithms.\n\n516\n00:26:11.963 --> 00:26:17.203\nThere's especially full\nthird-party applications that you\n\n517\n00:26:17.203 --> 00:26:22.436\ncan use that their whole job is\nto upsample images well to make,\n\n518\n00:26:22.436 --> 00:26:28.450\nto blow up images the right way,\nand make it to where it looks good.\n\n519\n00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:32.922\nWhatever secret sauce they've decided of\nhow it looks in the pixels and does it,\n\n520\n00:26:32.922 --> 00:26:35.510\nthat's why you would\npurchase that product.\n\n521\n00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.800\nAnd there's quite a few out there but\nPhotoshop has kind of gotten a lot better.\n\n522\n00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.860\nOkay, so let's move over to Photoshop cuz\nI wanted to show you just as an example.\n\n523\n00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.050\nHere, let me get this guy.\n\n524\n00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:52.020\nSo I have Photoshop, this image in\nPhotoshop opened, so I've got this.\n\n525\n00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.851\nWhen you're in Photoshop,\nto go to image resolution,\n\n526\n00:26:55.851 --> 00:26:58.874\nyou go to image and\nthen you go to Image Size.\n\n527\n00:26:58.874 --> 00:27:00.656\nI was looking for\nresolution and sorta said that.\n\n528\n00:27:00.656 --> 00:27:03.042\n[LAUGH] Okay, Image > Image Size, and\n\n529\n00:27:03.042 --> 00:27:07.860\nthat's going to give you the dimensions\nof this photograph, okay?\n\n530\n00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:15.890\nSo that's where you can see that it is\n3,000-by-4,000, the resolution is there.\n\n531\n00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.850\nOops, sorry, I was going to try and\nturn on something else but\n\n532\n00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.080\nI clicked somewhere else.\n\n533\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.650\nMy bad, let's keep going.\n\n534\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.820\nSo you can see that I've got this,\nand you can see this little box,\n\n535\n00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.670\nthis little line right here that's\nconnecting the width and height together,\n\n536\n00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.310\nbut doesn't go down to resolution, okay?\n\n537\n00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.710\nAs we go, resample is on.\n\n538\n00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.440\nResampling means change\nthe total number of pixels.\n\n539\n00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.460\nThis would be the wrong way to\nchange this resolution to 300 for\n\n540\n00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.460\nthis image by just coming to\nresolution and going 300.\n\n541\n00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.803\nWell, that's 3,000, 300,\n\n542\n00:27:44.803 --> 00:27:48.857\nit just made a whole bunch of more\npixels that I did not have, right?\n\n543\n00:27:48.857 --> 00:27:54.465\nIt went up, and even right up there,\nthe file size is now 600 MB and it was 34.\n\n544\n00:27:54.465 --> 00:27:56.010\nNo, I don't want that.\n\n545\n00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.650\nThat is the wrong way to change\nthe resolution of an image.\n\n546\n00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.540\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna cancel that just to go back.\n\n547\n00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.590\nThe right way to change\nthe resolution is to uncheck resample.\n\n548\n00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.970\nAnd as soon as you uncheck resample,\n\n549\n00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.950\ndo you see how these little lines\nright here come together, okay?\n\n550\n00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.660\n>> So not only the height and the width,\n\n551\n00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.740\nbut the resolution is also\ngonna be constrained.\n\n552\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.940\n>> And\nthey're all proportioned to each other.\n\n553\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.930\nOkay, so if I change the resolution\nfrom setting it from 72 to 300,\n\n554\n00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.640\nthat is the right way to\nchange the resolution.\n\n555\n00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.860\nIt did not change\nthe total number of pixels.\n\n556\n00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.178\nI just basically said all you\nall go together, get closer, and\n\n557\n00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:36.197\nthat means that the physical width and\nheight goes down.\n\n558\n00:28:36.197 --> 00:28:41.515\nJust to show you again that 72, it was 42\ninches by 56 inches at a 72 resolution.\n\n559\n00:28:41.515 --> 00:28:43.190\nThis is really just all math.\n\n560\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:46.710\nSo if I come back and say at 300,\nyour width and height goes down.\n\n561\n00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.010\nWith a ten inch by 13 inch,\n\n562\n00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:54.678\nthat would actually fit on the cover of\na magazine that is an eight-by-ten or\n\n563\n00:28:54.678 --> 00:28:58.820\neight and a half-by-11,\nfinal size for what I would need.\n\n564\n00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.540\nSo that would be the right way.\n\n565\n00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.280\nThat's where, if I only had 200-by-200,\nnot gonna work, okay?\n\n566\n00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.090\nSo that's how you change\nimage resolution for print.\n\n567\n00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.350\nAnd just to quickly go through\nthe rest of it, if I go to image and\n\n568\n00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.340\nI go to mode,\nthat's where I change the color.\n\n569\n00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.990\nSo I would change that to CNYK.\n\n570\n00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.895\nDon't worry about this.\n\n571\n00:29:16.895 --> 00:29:19.231\nLong story short, just say okay.\n\n572\n00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:22.888\nAnd then I would go through and do a File\n> Save As and change it to whatever file\n\n573\n00:29:22.888 --> 00:29:27.080\nformat that I would be using in a raster\nformat for print, it would be for TIFF.\n\n574\n00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:33.030\nSo that's how I would size an image\nproperly for print in Photoshop.\n\n575\n00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:37.470\nIf I was going to size this for\nweb, where am I going?\n\n576\n00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:44.245\nIf I need to put this into\na 300-by-500 picture frame,\n\n577\n00:29:44.245 --> 00:29:47.830\nif you wanna say, that's going to talk\nabout all of these different cats that\n\n578\n00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.530\nare the cats of the month or whatever,\nthat's the image size that I need.\n\n579\n00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:53.697\nThis was way too big.\n\n580\n00:29:53.697 --> 00:29:55.120\nI got way too much information.\n\n581\n00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.699\nSo you go to Image,\nyou go to Image Size, same thing.\n\n582\n00:29:59.699 --> 00:30:04.596\nI've already got the resolution here,\nso if your resolution is set then you\n\n583\n00:30:04.596 --> 00:30:10.120\ndo check on resample because I don't\nwanna change the resolution here.\n\n584\n00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.730\nI really wanna change the file dimensions.\n\n585\n00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.893\nHow many pixels by how many pixels\nthis photo is going to occupy?\n\n586\n00:30:15.893 --> 00:30:18.876\nAnd this is where the image\nsize comes into play.\n\n587\n00:30:18.876 --> 00:30:24.129\nThis is a 34 meg file,\nwith a 3,000-by-4,000 pixel.\n\n588\n00:30:24.129 --> 00:30:25.480\nI don't need that.\n\n589\n00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.150\nSo uncheck or, sorry, check on resample.\n\n590\n00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.210\nI do wanna change the number of pixels.\n\n591\n00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.481\nI don't want it to be measured in inches,\nso I'm gonna change this to pixels.\n\n592\n00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:37.145\nAnd I'm gonna say I want this to be 300.\n\n593\n00:30:37.145 --> 00:30:41.001\nWell, we'll go with 400 cuz that's the\nheight, but whichever one's is going to,\n\n594\n00:30:41.001 --> 00:30:44.300\nlike if I really wanted to be 500 height,\nI would then change to 500.\n\n595\n00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.530\nI would crop out the rest of the width.\n\n596\n00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.480\nThen, you can crop it to the specific\ndimensions that you want.\n\n597\n00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.179\nBut, if I go here,\nthis is a 300-by-400 file.\n\n598\n00:30:52.179 --> 00:30:55.631\nNow, it's gonna be 350 K.\n\n599\n00:30:55.631 --> 00:30:57.811\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah, that's where it is.\n\n600\n00:30:57.811 --> 00:30:58.627\n>> Huge difference.\n\n601\n00:30:58.627 --> 00:31:02.836\n>> That's what makes this, and this\nresolution, this resolution can be 72,\n\n602\n00:31:02.836 --> 00:31:05.920\nthis resolution could be 150,\nthis could be 450.\n\n603\n00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.115\nIt doesn't matter if\nyou're going to screen.\n\n604\n00:31:09.115 --> 00:31:13.726\nIt's pixel to pixel,\nit's gonna show up as 300-by-400.\n\n605\n00:31:13.726 --> 00:31:18.235\nRegards the resolution,\nin actuality, is a print thing,\n\n606\n00:31:18.235 --> 00:31:24.654\nit's not necessarily a web thing, but\nin the whole, this is a concept, it is 72.\n\n607\n00:31:24.654 --> 00:31:28.445\nAll right, so there we go and\nthen that's it.\n\n608\n00:31:28.445 --> 00:31:30.940\nNow ooh, this is really small,\nthat's okay.\n\n609\n00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.257\nIt's already in RGB color modes for good.\n\n610\n00:31:33.257 --> 00:31:36.020\nFor this, for a website,\nI would use a JPEG.\n\n611\n00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.320\nI would not be changing this to a GIF or\na PNG.\n\n612\n00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.820\nI guess I could do a PNG but\nI would just still stick with JPEGs.\n\n613\n00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.110\n>> PNG being?\n\n614\n00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.590\n>> Portable network graphics sorry.\n\n615\n00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.540\n>> Yep, yep.\n>> Yes, PNG, they also refer to as pings.\n\n616\n00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.875\nSorry.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n617\n00:31:48.875 --> 00:31:51.200\n>> And that's what we've got.\n\n618\n00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.710\nThat's, I think, everything you can\nknow about with image resolution and\n\n619\n00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.390\nfile formats.\n\n620\n00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:57.970\n>> That's a great look at it.\n\n621\n00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.470\nA lot of questions that I know I and\n\n622\n00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.060\nmaybe some of you out there,\nhave always wondered about.\n\n623\n00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.660\nEspecially when you go to work with one of\nthese images and you start changing these\n\n624\n00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:11.540\nnumbers and all of a sudden your image\ngets crazy pixelated or gets really,\n\n625\n00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.170\nreally tiny, like it's now a thumbnail or\nsomething like that.\n\n626\n00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.460\nSo we thank you for that, Vaughn,\nhope everybody out their enjoyed watching.\n\n627\n00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.620\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your Mike Rodrick.\n\n628\n00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.340\n>> And I'm Vaughn Smith.\n\n629\n00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.960\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

here\nat ITProTV I'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:19.261\ntoday we're doing\nAdobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.590\nAnd, specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.730\nwe're gonna be looking at working\nwith images within Illustrator.\n\n7\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.420\nWe've had a couple episodes where we've\ntalked about file types of images and\n\n8\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.590\nresolution for our images, for\nboth the web and for print.\n\n9\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.670\nNow, we've got, now that we know\nwhat we're doing with our images,\n\n10\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.030\nneed to get them into our\nproject in Illustrator.\n\n11\n00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.860\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Miss Von Smith.\n\n12\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.700\nHow you doing, Von?\n\n13\n00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.780\n>> I'm good.\n\n14\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.411\nI'm here to talk about images in\nIllustrator, just like Mike said.\n\n15\n00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.271\n[LAUGH] And\n\n16\n00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:50.670\nthe one thing you did forget was that\nyou also understand the color modes.\n\n17\n00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.270\n>> Yes.\n>> Yes,\n\n18\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.740\nwe had a lot of episodes about colors and\n\n19\n00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.900\nthe RGB versus\n>> CMYK.\n\n20\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.560\nJPEG versus a TIFF.\n\n21\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.460\nThat's the basics of images.\n\n22\n00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.350\nSo how do I make my images\nget into my brochure or\n\n23\n00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.050\nad or logo or\nwhatever I'm doing in Illustrator?\n\n24\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.980\nWith a chair and\na whip like the old lion tamer.\n\n25\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.538\nGet in there.\n\n26\n00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:14.543\nNo?\n\n27\n00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:19.310\n>> Well no, but good visual.\n\n28\n00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.680\nWe will place the images into the cage.\n\n29\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.320\n>> There you go-\n>> So-\n\n30\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.060\n>> Okay.\n\n31\n00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.630\n>> Whip and\n\n32\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.336\na chair, so.\n\n33\n00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:27.164\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:27.164 --> 00:01:30.780\n>> All right, so I've got a file ready for\n\n35\n00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.300\nus that has a little bit of an Overview so\n\n36\n00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.090\nwe can get the kind of\nbasics of how do we do it.\n\n37\n00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.390\nI already said place-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n38\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.310\n>> We're gonna place images.\n\n39\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.900\nAnd you do that by doing a file place.\n\n40\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.060\nBut, I'd like to start off also by\nsaying that this illustrator is not\n\n41\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.100\na roster editing program, you don't take\nan image and remove a spot off of a shirt.\n\n42\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.397\nOr change the eye color of your cats or\nwhat have you making me thinner.\n\n43\n00:02:01.397 --> 00:02:05.032\n>> [LAUGH] Right, yes,\nthe nice [SOUND]- that's all in Photoshop.\n\n44\n00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:08.580\nSo photo editing is\ndone in other programs.\n\n45\n00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.490\nThis is where your end\nimage just goes into it.\n\n46\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.330\nSo there's a limited amount\nof things that you can do\n\n47\n00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.860\nwith images in a sense of\nediting it To look different.\n\n48\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.240\n>> So if we're talking about our workflow\nthen the images would already be prepared\n\n49\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.760\nfor my project by the time\nI get Illustrator open.\n\n50\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.310\n>> Exactly.\n>> Except for maybe some minor.\n\n51\n00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.150\n>> Yeah, I can do some things.\n\n52\n00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.620\nAnd that's what I'll demonstrate and\nI'll show you guys what you can do.\n\n53\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.540\nBut I just want to show you\nwhat you can't do, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.280\nYou don't open an image in Illustrator and\nstart doing stuff.\n\n55\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.460\nYou can open it.\n\n56\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.870\nIt will allow you to open up a jpeg or\n\n57\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.500\na tiff but that's not the purpose\nof the program really.\n\n58\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.210\nSo what you do is you place it.\n\n59\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.970\nAnd when you place an image It\nwill grab whatever image and\n\n60\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.120\nit goes into your document.\n\n61\n00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.090\nIt is important to understand that by\ndefault, when you place a document into\n\n62\n00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.470\nIllustrator it will be\nlinked to the source file.\n\n63\n00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.720\nWhich means if I have my AI\nfile stored in one folder and\n\n64\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.380\nmy images in another folder.\n\n65\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.680\nAnd for some reason I'm cleaning house,\n\n66\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.850\nand I move my pictures\nto a different location.\n\n67\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.710\nWell, when I go back to my\nIllustrator document and\n\n68\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.650\nopen it up, it's gonna be like.\n\n69\n00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.330\nI don't know where the picture\nwent because it creates a path\n\n70\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.980\nspecifically to where you told\nit where that picture is.\n\n71\n00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.900\nAnd if you move it,\nit doesn't update itself by default.\n\n72\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.730\nIt doesn't understand.\n\n73\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.060\nIt's like a hard link if you\nwanna say to wherever that is.\n\n74\n00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.710\nSo just know that that's gonna happen and\njust be aware of it, and\n\n75\n00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.020\nthen just know how to fix it,\nwhich I'll show.\n\n76\n00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.390\nBecause you can go back and relink images.\n\n77\n00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.790\nYou're like, I forgot I moved that.\n\n78\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.470\nOkay, let me tell you Illustrator.\n\n79\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.150\nWhere that is right now and why would you\nwant to have the images linked because\n\n80\n00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.420\nif I have a bunch of pictures that\nI'm creating for an advertisement.\n\n81\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.920\nIf they lived inside of\nthe illustrator document,\n\n82\n00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.600\nits going to be a really,\nreally big illustrator file.\n\n83\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.530\nSo there's a reason why you\nmight want to keep it linked.\n\n84\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.630\nI've already set it.\n\n85\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.990\nYou can embed a picture into the file.\n\n86\n00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.920\nSo, it's like I don't want you to have any\nconnection, to where the source file is.\n\n87\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.540\nI want you to live inside of\nthe Illustrator document.\n\n88\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.510\nThat is possible, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.920\nI think we've talked about that with\nfonts, where if I'm sending you a file and\n\n90\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.840\nI have Fonts in there,\nI don't send you the font files with it.\n\n91\n00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.970\nThen if you don't have the fonts,\nit doesn't work.\n\n92\n00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.430\n>> That was going to be my next question.\n\n93\n00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.150\nIf I put an image here and\nit's linked, and I send you that file,\n\n94\n00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.780\nthat means I've also got to send\nyou the photo itself, as well?\n\n95\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.920\n>> If it's linked, yes.\n\n96\n00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.550\n>> And the path is not gonna move\ndepending on where you copy them to your\n\n97\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.180\nmachine the path might break anyway\neven if you've got the picture.\n\n98\n00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.055\n>> Yes, and\nthat's why they have packaging.\n\n99\n00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:04.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> Ahhh.\n\n100\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.860\n>> So there is an actual\ncommand that you can do that.\n\n101\n00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.470\n>> Packs it all up in a nice little bow,\nand it says all right,\n\n102\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.330\nI'm not doing a link to wherever it is on\nyour computer, I'm linking within itself.\n\n103\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.700\nIt's like an internal link,\nif you wanna say.\n\n104\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.280\n>> Very good.\n>> And\n\n105\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.590\nthat's where I would send you the entire\npackage, I would ZIP the folder and\n\n106\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.720\nsend you that, and that gives you\n>> All the images, all the fonts, and\n\n107\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.250\neverything ready to go for you.\n\n108\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.680\nSo that's a great point, and yep, and\nit's in our little notes right here.\n\n109\n00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.570\nSo I have right here package to transport.\n\n110\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.510\n>> Ah-ha.\n\n111\n00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.470\n>> So that's what you could do to\nkeep everything together, okay?\n\n112\n00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.200\nSo, reasons why you want to embed,\n\n113\n00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.650\nreasons why don't want to embed Knowing\nthat it's always linked by default.\n\n114\n00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.200\nYou can change that setting and\nknowing that packages is there.\n\n115\n00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.870\nI also through in here clipping masks and\n\n116\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.200\neffects because those are things that you\ncan do to change the look and modify,\n\n117\n00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.010\nif you want to say,\nyour images within Illustrator.\n\n118\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.240\nSo those are some kinds of fun\nthings that we'll go over.\n\n119\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.050\nAnd just one other little note,\nis when we talk about we know,\n\n120\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.580\nwe understand why you want to have a 300,\nCMYK,\n\n121\n00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:25.830\nTiff image if you're doing a final\nproject for print, publication.\n\n122\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.000\nSo you know you need to get in that but\nit also,\n\n123\n00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.280\nwhen you export whatever said\nproject out of Illustrator.\n\n124\n00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.660\nThe end result determines\nthe resolution because if I take and\n\n125\n00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.250\nmake an ad for print.\n\n126\n00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.610\nAnd then, I also want to take the same\nversion and put it on my website.\n\n127\n00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.000\nWell in Illustrator,\nas long as I just go ahead and\n\n128\n00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.530\nexport that out as a JPEG\nat a 72 RGB resolution.\n\n129\n00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.880\nThen that JPEG becomes\nthat end resolution, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.350\nSo, but in reverse,\nif I place an image in Illustrator\n\n131\n00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.640\nat a 72 RGB and\nit says at a small resolution, and\n\n132\n00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.880\nthen I export my Illustrator document\nout as a high resolution PDF.\n\n133\n00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.050\nIt didn't start as a high resolution, so\nit's just gonna do that up sampling and\n\n134\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.230\nyou could have issues with that way.\n\n135\n00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.000\nSo it is okay to go down.\n\n136\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.530\nIt's not always as good to go up,\nif you wanna say.\n\n137\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.000\nSo that's why you always\nwanna start up and go down.\n\n138\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.770\nSo there's my overview.\n\n139\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.930\nI have a little picture of what we were\ndoing in the image resolution episode of\n\n140\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.560\nmy little kitties, so\nI've got Fuego and Bishop here.\n\n141\n00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.930\nThey're the stars of the image shows.\n\n142\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.297\nSo right now this has\nalready been placed and\n\n143\n00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:48.941\nyou always wanna look at\nyour tool options bar.\n\n144\n00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:51.274\nJust being always aware of your\nenvironment that you're looking at in\n\n145\n00:07:51.274 --> 00:07:51.793\nIllustrator.\n\n146\n00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:55.074\nSo you can see up here in the tool\noptions bar that they linked.\n\n147\n00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:59.982\nFile, it shows me the name of the file\nthat it's linked to, the color mode, and\n\n148\n00:07:59.982 --> 00:08:01.100\nthe resolution.\n\n149\n00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.510\nSo, you can see all of that\nacross the top of where this,\n\n150\n00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.060\nit's just telling you that\nthis is what it's got.\n\n151\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.270\nOkay?\nAnd, now, this 36x369, what?\n\n152\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.350\nWe'll get more when I place other files,\nso you can see the differentiation,\n\n153\n00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.010\nbecause you're not.\n\n154\n00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.970\nIt's that whole concept of that image size\ngoes down, the resolution goes up and\n\n155\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.150\nvice versa.\n\n156\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.400\nIt's not going to resample\nyour images in Illustrator.\n\n157\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.810\nSo that's the key point there.\n\n158\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.740\nOkay, and it is a linked file,\nnow where is this?\n\n159\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.540\nThat hard link?\n\n160\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.360\nIf you click that linked\nlink if you want to say,\n\n161\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.280\nin the tool option bar, it shows it.\n\n162\n00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.730\nI actually made this bigger so that you\nguys could see it a little bit better.\n\n163\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:47.820\nIt's showing me that the location Is\nin that folder so it's letting me know.\n\n164\n00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.470\nOkay it's in my images smaller folder,\nand it's RGB, and here's the dimensions.\n\n165\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.950\nAnd here's the ending resolution because I\n\n166\n00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.280\nmade it smaller within Illustrator, so\nthe resolution gets jacked up, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.800\nSo I can do that,\nthere's also some buttons in here\n\n168\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.790\nwhere if i did have a missing image,\nI could relink it.\n\n169\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.460\nMaybe I have it placed, but\nI wanna link it to a newer version.\n\n170\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.850\nMaybe I have a different\nphoto of Fuego and\n\n171\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.870\nBishop that I wanted to put in\nthere with a different name.\n\n172\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.300\nI can re-link it to something else, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.650\nSo there's a couple different options\nto go to the link Update the link,\n\n174\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.660\nedit the original.\n\n175\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.510\nThat's actually is gonna like\ntake you out into Photoshop.\n\n176\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.720\nSo you have some different items there.\n\n177\n00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.940\nAnd that's like the end results so\nhow do i get the pictures in my file.\n\n178\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.930\nWell, that's where you go to File>Place.\n\n179\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.800\nI'm going to place\nthe images into Illustrator.\n\n180\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.060\nI'm in that images smaller folder so\nmaybe I wanna pull up a couple more.\n\n181\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.450\nSo maybe I wanna get a picture\nof a fellow lounging in the sun.\n\n182\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.190\nNotice down here when I click on\nthe image It does have right there Link\n\n183\n00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.050\nchecked on by default.\n\n184\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.120\nSo that's where if you\ndidn't want it linked and\n\n185\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.920\nembedded right from the get go,\nuncheck that.\n\n186\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.920\nBut that's always on in the beginning,\nokay.\n\n187\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.440\nWe'll come back to\nthe Show Import Options in a second.\n\n188\n00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.030\nThere isn't any import options on a JPG so\nI just go to Place.\n\n189\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.490\nIt goes ahead and loads up my cursor\nicon with the of saying okay,\n\n190\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.870\nwell where do you want to go?\n\n191\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.890\nAnd if I want to go here,\nthere are to ways you can do this.\n\n192\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.410\nYou can just click, and\nit puts it in in its default size, and\n\n193\n00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.460\nresolution of whatever the file is.\n\n194\n00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.090\nSo if I click, and\nwow if that's kind of big.\n\n195\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.950\nAnd I can size it down, but if I back up,\n\n196\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:34.230\nlet me go grab it again sorry,\nwhich one were we doing.\n\n197\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.220\nThere you go out in the yard.\n\n198\n00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:35.890\n>> There we go.\nI should\n\n199\n00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.380\nprobably name them besides\na number it'll probably be easier.\n\n200\n00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.390\nClicking is one way but click, hold and\n\n201\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.640\ndrag is like determining\nthe space that I want to occupy.\n\n202\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.310\nAnd I'm not holding shift by the way\nit's gonna constrain the proportions to\n\n203\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.150\nwhatever the aspect ratio\nthe file was to begin with.\n\n204\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.550\nSo if I wanted to just occupy that\namount of space I'll let go, and\n\n205\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.700\nyou can see there you go.\n\n206\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.980\nAnd because it was smaller or because I\nmade it into a smaller within height,\n\n207\n00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.870\nthe resolution went way up, but\nI know the resolution of that image is 72.\n\n208\n00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.330\nI just know because it came from my\ncamera and it always comes in that way.\n\n209\n00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.521\nSo that's it really, File > Place.\n\n210\n00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:17.700\nAnd another thing you could do,\nif I just went ahead and\n\n211\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.810\nI wanted to ge maybe two more.\n\n212\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.270\nMaybe, I wanted to put in this one and\nthis one.\n\n213\n00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:27.540\nSo I can select, you can select multiple\nfiles to place which is kind of fun\n\n214\n00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.200\nbecause I want all five of them.\n\n215\n00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.690\nJust grab however many pictures you want,\nshift or control click to go ahead and\n\n216\n00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:34.890\ngo through whatever ones you want.\n\n217\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.480\nYou place it and then it loads it up.\n\n218\n00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.050\nYou can see right there it\nactually says one of two.\n\n219\n00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.230\nSo it's letting me know that\nits got two pictures loaded\n\n220\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.950\nup in the gun if you want to say,\nready to shoot out.\n\n221\n00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.790\nBut, if I'm not ready to place It's\nthe fuego in the tree picture.\n\n222\n00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.290\nIf you use your up or down arrows,\nyou can actually cycle through\n\n223\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.440\nthe pictures to say, I want them here\nfirst, I want them laying together.\n\n224\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.625\nAnd so if I just click hold and drag and\nmake it that side, I'm putting it all.\n\n225\n00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.985\nOff, because I'm running out of space.\n\n226\n00:12:01.985 --> 00:12:06.515\nThere's that, but now if I took Fuego and\nAtwee and I click,\n\n227\n00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:09.585\njust to show you,\nsee that is showing it as 72 ppi up here.\n\n228\n00:12:09.585 --> 00:12:12.662\nSo that's the native resolution and\n\n229\n00:12:12.662 --> 00:12:18.600\nthat's the native size that it is, but\nif I take this and make it smaller.\n\n230\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.760\nAnd this is where you would wanna hold the\nshift on this time because I don't wanna\n\n231\n00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.880\nmake him look like that.\n\n232\n00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.825\nI mean I'm sure he wishes he\nwas a little thinner, but-\n\n233\n00:12:25.825 --> 00:12:27.490\n>> [LAUGH] Don't we all.\n\n234\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.990\n>> So I would take this,\nI hold my shift key and I make it\n\n235\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.370\n>> Smaller, and so\n\n236\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.490\nyou can see that once I made it\nsmaller the resolution does go up\n\n237\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.630\ncuz it is adhering to\nthe rules of not resampling.\n\n238\n00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.620\nAnd size goes down resolution goes up.\n\n239\n00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.920\nAnd vice versa if I made this bigger,\nright?\n\n240\n00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.000\nIf I took this out, and\nI want it to be that big,\n\n241\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.300\nwell 79 resolution's fine for screen.\n\n242\n00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.600\nBut if I was doing this\nin a print publication,\n\n243\n00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.000\nthis wouldn't fly, even if I export it out\nas a high resolution print file, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.540\nSo that's how it works.\n\n245\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.940\n>> Okay, you just place the images and\nthen you move along on your merry way.\n\n246\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:12.300\nAnd we'll do some other things with\nthe clicking masks in just a second.\n\n247\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.870\nI just wanted to do\na quick little thing here.\n\n248\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:19.030\nI wanted to save my Illustrator file and\njust to demonstrate what's gonna happen,\n\n249\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.640\ndon't worry,\nwe'll get to that in a second.\n\n250\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.310\n>> If, let's say,\nI take my folder of images_smaller,\n\n251\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.420\nand I take this and\nI put it out onto the desktop, right?\n\n252\n00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.280\nI've moved that whole source file,\nlike it's gone.\n\n253\n00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.180\nLike I did some cleaning and\nI moved it out.\n\n254\n00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.160\nI come back into Illustrator.\n\n255\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.010\nI know, I'm not gonna say.\n\n256\n00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.910\nI'm gonna say no for\nthis one because I already had files open.\n\n257\n00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:47.440\nBut I wanted to show you that if I come\nback in, and then later come in to say,\n\n258\n00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:47.950\nall right.\n\n259\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.050\nWell, let's go ahead and\nopen up that Images and\n\n260\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.975\nIllustrator file that I was working\nwith a couple days ago or what have you.\n\n261\n00:13:54.975 --> 00:13:55.920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I open this up and\n\n262\n00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.760\nit's going to say wait a second.\n\n263\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.400\nI don't understand.\n\n264\n00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.700\nYou told me there was files here and\nnow I can't find them, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.990\nSo it will prompt you right\nin the very beginning of I\n\n266\n00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.390\ndon't know where it went, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.300\nAnd you could go ahead and\nimmediately, say, I know where it is,\n\n268\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.890\nlet me go ahead an replace it for\nyou right now.\n\n269\n00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.940\nAnd you could apply to all, because all\nof those images that are in that file.\n\n270\n00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.360\nRemember, it's in that one folder, right?\n\n271\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.535\nI move the whole folder If I apply it to\none, it's going to say, wait, well that\n\n272\n00:14:23.535 --> 00:14:26.295\none was associated with the other one of\nwhere it lived, and now I'm going here.\n\n273\n00:14:26.295 --> 00:14:28.065\nOkay, I'll go ahead and\ndo the rest of them that way too.\n\n274\n00:14:28.065 --> 00:14:30.635\nSo that's kind of nice if\nthey're all in one location.\n\n275\n00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:31.215\n>> Very handy.\n\n276\n00:14:31.215 --> 00:14:32.595\n>> Yeah.\nSo you can replace it right from\n\n277\n00:14:32.595 --> 00:14:33.495\nthe beginning.\n\n278\n00:14:33.495 --> 00:14:35.345\nNow if I ignore it, it's like okay.\n\n279\n00:14:35.345 --> 00:14:37.065\nLet me apply to all\nbecause I got a couple.\n\n280\n00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:39.370\nAnd I ignore, it's going to be like okay.\n\n281\n00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.270\nIt still thinks it's there, right?\n\n282\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.660\nIt's giving me, hey, I was here, right?\n\n283\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.930\nAnd it said it was still linked.\n\n284\n00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.520\nIt's just in the wrong location, okay?\n\n285\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.270\nI like to go ahead and\n\n286\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.540\ndo it when I have the replace dialog\nbox right from the beginning.\n\n287\n00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.580\nBut if you get to this point you can\ngo back over into, I know it was there,\n\n288\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.600\nyou go into linked and\nthis is where you can go to the relinking.\n\n289\n00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.155\nTell it where it lives now, and then just\nsay, whoops, that's the wrong place.\n\n290\n00:15:08.155 --> 00:15:13.185\n[LAUGH] Right here, and then find\nthe file and then it will go ahead,\n\n291\n00:15:13.185 --> 00:15:17.580\n121.\n\n292\n00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.990\nSorry, that's where I should\nname my files, but [LAUGH].\n\n293\n00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.700\nAnd then, I go ahead and say, yes there\nis and then it goes ahead and finds it.\n\n294\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.390\n>> Nice.\n>> Okay.\n\n295\n00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.830\nSo you can always change it back\n\n296\n00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.420\nif you need to and relink it.\n\n297\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.519\nI'm going to undo this and close this.\n\n298\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:39.450\nAnd then, move the files back into where\nit was so everybody all lives together.\n\n299\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.120\nNow I go ahead, and\nit will be all fine again.\n\n300\n00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.280\nI always like to show it because I feel\nthat really demonstrates the point\n\n301\n00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.060\nof, okay.\n\n302\n00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.389\nAnd since somebody moved it back in,\nall the pictures are fine.\n\n303\n00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:52.083\nEverything's fixed.\n\n304\n00:15:52.083 --> 00:15:53.229\n>> Everything is fixed.\n\n305\n00:15:53.229 --> 00:15:58.134\nAll right so, re-linking, embedding,\nwhat if I wanted to embed this?\n\n306\n00:15:58.134 --> 00:16:02.389\nI really don't want to have to\nworry about this, right there,\n\n307\n00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:05.440\nthere's an Embed button right there.\n\n308\n00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.080\nI select it, so that's pretty easy.\n\n309\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.700\nOkay, perfect.\n\n310\n00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.620\nI have it embedded.\n\n311\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.100\nAnd now notice over here,\nit doesn't say linked file any more.\n\n312\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:11.900\nIt says image.\n\n313\n00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.020\nIt's just saying, here's an image\nthat's living inside of Illustrator and\n\n314\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.160\nthat's where you got it.\n\n315\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:24.350\nOkay, so and you can also notice now look\nat the non-X versus the X over the image.\n\n316\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.680\nThat's another visual indication to you,\nin your document,\n\n317\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.630\nthat you have linked images\nversus embedded images.\n\n318\n00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.720\nThat's pretty fun.\n\n319\n00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.520\nClipping masks.\n\n320\n00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:41.420\nI have Fuego here lounging in the sun,\nbut I wanted to not be square.\n\n321\n00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.780\nI wanted to, I want to have a frame.\n\n322\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.520\n>> Okay.\n>> I want to put it,\n\n323\n00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.430\nI want t make in a circle.\n\n324\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.280\nMaybe just kind of a vignette or\n\n325\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.966\nwhatever you want to say of little fuego,\nbig fuego.\n\n326\n00:16:52.966 --> 00:16:54.250\n[LAUGH].\n\n327\n00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.960\nWhat a clipping mass means a mask, right?\n\n328\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.250\nWhen you think of masks I\nthink that it's on your face.\n\n329\n00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.360\nRight?\n\n330\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.430\nYou grab a Halloween mask and\nit's covering your face, but\n\n331\n00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.380\nyou have two little holes\nwhen you're eyes pop out.\n\n332\n00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.750\nSo, that's the only thing you see is\nmy eyes through this howling mask.\n\n333\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:16.620\nIt's the same concept in\nanything that has masks.\n\n334\n00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.040\nYou're masking one thing versus the other.\n\n335\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.700\nSo there's like what you see it through,\nand\n\n336\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.930\nthen the thing that comes\nout from underneath it.\n\n337\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:30.743\nUnderneath there, that's another key\nfactor of it all depends on the layers,\n\n338\n00:17:30.743 --> 00:17:34.230\nor arrangements, what's on top,\nwhat's on bottom, okay?\n\n339\n00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:41.360\nSo if I have this image that I would\nlike to show through this frame, okay?\n\n340\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.340\nThat's not gonna work, why?\n\n341\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.940\nBecause the image is on top of the frame.\n\n342\n00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.250\nSo you need to make sure that I'm just\ngonna send this all the way to the back\n\n343\n00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.480\njust cuz I know it'll go all the way back.\n\n344\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.100\nThat what I want to show\nthrough is behind, what I want\n\n345\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.660\nthe parameter of the frame that's on top,\nokay?\n\n346\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.300\nYou take both of them, and I just selected\nboth of them, I just clicked, hold, and\n\n347\n00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.240\ndrag, you wanna make a clipping mask.\n\n348\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.653\nEasiest way, I think,\nis right-clicking, okay?\n\n349\n00:18:10.653 --> 00:18:13.490\nIf you right-click,\nyou can make a clipping mask, and\n\n350\n00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.330\nthen when I click it, there you go.\n\n351\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.630\nFuego is shown in the circle, so\n\n352\n00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.520\nit's coming through, just like if you\nwere matting a photograph in a frame.\n\n353\n00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.710\nThat's what you want to show through,\nand now you have it as a clip group.\n\n354\n00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.960\nSo I can move this around, and I can do\nwhatever I want with it, and that's fine.\n\n355\n00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.260\nPlace it here, but\nmaybe I wanna move Fuego.\n\n356\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.490\nHe's a little off center, or\nI want the frame to be smaller.\n\n357\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.460\nIt's still two pieces.\n\n358\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.010\nIt didn't delete the pixels.\n\n359\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.360\nIt's just hiding them.\n\n360\n00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.600\nIt's masking them.\n\n361\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.910\nThat's the whole idea about masking.\n\n362\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.410\nIt's hiding.\n\n363\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.290\nSo, it is like a group.\n\n364\n00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.960\nI can double click to go into isolation\nmode to get either part of it.\n\n365\n00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.940\nSo if I double click under here,\nyou can say I'm in the Clip group.\n\n366\n00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:04.355\nNow I can see that this is the picture\nyou can actually see the X in the photo.\n\n367\n00:19:04.355 --> 00:19:06.875\nSo I can move this around a little bit,\nand\n\n368\n00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:09.515\nI know the frame edge\nis about right there.\n\n369\n00:19:09.515 --> 00:19:12.105\nI got the dot at the end of the tail,\nso I can take this.\n\n370\n00:19:12.105 --> 00:19:15.100\nMaybe go ahead and\nmake this a little smaller.\n\n371\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.930\nAnd so there's where the frame,\nmaybe I wanna make it more of an oval or\n\n372\n00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.850\nwhat have you,\nwhatever you wanna do is fine.\n\n373\n00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:28.350\nIt's just the concept of moving\nthe picture versus moving or\n\n374\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.130\nmodifying The frame that it comes in.\n\n375\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.530\n>> Very cool.\n\n376\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.240\n>> Now, I can double click off that,\n\n377\n00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.570\nget out of the clip group,\nand that is my clipping mask.\n\n378\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.680\nThe other thing you can do with\nimages would be adding effects.\n\n379\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.200\nNow, effects is very similar\nto Photoshop filters.\n\n380\n00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.140\nIf you're familiar with Photoshop\nyou do have filters within that.\n\n381\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.090\nYou have a filter menu.\n\n382\n00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.180\nIt's almost the same.\n\n383\n00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.500\nThey actually use the same names and\nit goes into the filter gallery.\n\n384\n00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.080\nOr in this sense I guess it's\nan effects gallery because\n\n385\n00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.400\nthey're effects in Illustrator,\nthey're filters in Photoshop.\n\n386\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.460\nSo if I take my picture, whether it's\nlinked or embedded, that doesn't matter.\n\n387\n00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.920\nI can go here and go to my effect menu and\nyou can see down here I have Photoshop\n\n388\n00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.790\neffects, and I can do some\nglowing edges or what have you.\n\n389\n00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:24.010\nI always do glowing edges because it's\nalways my go-to demonstration because\n\n390\n00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.420\nit's really shows you something.\n\n391\n00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.033\n>> Easier to see it.\n\n392\n00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:27.641\n>> Yeah it's like hello.\n\n393\n00:20:27.641 --> 00:20:31.475\nI just did a Ctrl+0 to just fit in\nthe frames, like that's kind of scary.\n\n394\n00:20:31.475 --> 00:20:32.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n395\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:37.270\nthis is exactly like the filter gallery\nin Photoshop, so if I wanted to go and\n\n396\n00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:42.430\ndo angled strokes or\nwhatever type of effect that I want.\n\n397\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.410\nThat's kind of scary,\nnot that glowing edges is any less scary,\n\n398\n00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.240\nbut if I want to do this and\nsay yep, that's what I want to do.\n\n399\n00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.420\nAnd you can change all the effects\nover here and click okay, and\n\n400\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.240\nit goes ahead and adds that effect to\nthat photograph and that's support.\n\n401\n00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.870\nThat's the kind of modifications\nthat you can do in Illustrator.\n\n402\n00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:06.150\nNow this isn't an episode on effects,\nwe do talk about that a lot more in-depth\n\n403\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.260\nwhen we get into the effects and\nappearance.\n\n404\n00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.630\nBut if you did want to alter\nthe glowing edges or remove it.\n\n405\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.680\nYou don't go back into effects and\ngo to stocks,\n\n406\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.870\nthen you're actually adding\na separate instance of glowing edges.\n\n407\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.100\nAnd I think it actually tells you.\n\n408\n00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:21.960\nYep, there you go.\n\n409\n00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.280\nAre you wanting to do a new one or\nyou wanna edit?\n\n410\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.420\nAnd it does tell you that you\ndo that in the Parents panel.\n\n411\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.660\nSo, a parents panel is actually over here,\nand\n\n412\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.700\nyou can see that there's my glowing edges,\nand I can take this and\n\n413\n00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.750\ngo into the actual glowing edges affect.\n\n414\n00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.030\nAnd maybe change the edge width or what\nhave you, and I can modify it from there.\n\n415\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.650\nSo anytime, god.\n\n416\n00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.260\nWe need to take that off.\n\n417\n00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:49.760\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.220\n>> It's kinda scaring me.\n\n419\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.760\nBut, you could always edit effects\n\n420\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.810\nIn the appearance panel.\n\n421\n00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.170\nAnd right here you can turn them on and\noff, but I don't want this anymore.\n\n422\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.255\nWhoops, sorry, let me cancel that.\n\n423\n00:22:01.255 --> 00:22:04.120\n[LAUGH] I do not want to\nhave that effect on it,\n\n424\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.000\nso I can actually just remove that\neffect from the appearance of my\n\n425\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.780\nItem selected in Illustrator and\nso I can do that, all right.\n\n426\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.100\nAnd since we have a little\nbit of time left,\n\n427\n00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.910\nI would want to show you something\nwith opacity masks, okay.\n\n428\n00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.600\nCuz this is where and\na mask is like a hard edge.\n\n429\n00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:33.380\nIf I was doing a you'd want it to\nkind of blur out towards the edges.\n\n430\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:39.550\nIn a clipping mask,\nit's just a hard edge, ok?\n\n431\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.740\nOne small note, a little detour,\nanything could be a clipping mask.\n\n432\n00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.700\nIt doesn't have to does not just\nassociate with a photograph.\n\n433\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.810\nYou can take a vector shape,\ntake another vector shape and\n\n434\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.490\nmake a clipping mask out of that.\n\n435\n00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.460\nSo I don't want you to think that clipping\nmaster is only reserved for images.\n\n436\n00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.220\nThe concept is the exact same.\n\n437\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.860\nIt's something showing\nthrough something else.\n\n438\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.940\nBut, I think it's most I think it's\neasily demonstrated with Photo Grasp,\n\n439\n00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.910\nbut anything can become\na clipping mask and\n\n440\n00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.530\nactually they're used a lot when\nyou get in to opening PDFs.\n\n441\n00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.842\nI'll stop there.\n\n442\n00:23:09.842 --> 00:23:10.354\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:23:10.354 --> 00:23:13.820\n>> But opacity masks is where it's\n\n444\n00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:19.130\nthe same idea, you're hiding and\nshowing something, but using a gradient,\n\n445\n00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.920\nand we've talked about\ngradients is where it gradiates\n\n446\n00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.458\n>> I don't know.\n\n447\n00:23:23.458 --> 00:23:26.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It blends from one color to another.\n\n448\n00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.830\nSo, if I have a certain gradient\non an image using a mask,\n\n449\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:39.180\nit's actually going to use this whole\nconcept of masking where black is hide.\n\n450\n00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.470\nWhite is show.\n\n451\n00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.140\nOkay, so it's kind of like lights.\n\n452\n00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.501\nLights on, lights off.\n\n453\n00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:44.758\nWhat you can see, what you can't see.\n\n454\n00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:45.265\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n455\n00:23:45.265 --> 00:23:48.571\n>> And that's the difference between\nblack and white when working in mass.\n\n456\n00:23:48.571 --> 00:23:53.506\nSo I could take,\nI'll just take this image right here,\n\n457\n00:23:53.506 --> 00:23:57.287\nand I could take a gradient\nover an image and\n\n458\n00:23:57.287 --> 00:24:02.957\nI could create an opacity mask to\nwhere the black will be hiding,\n\n459\n00:24:02.957 --> 00:24:08.628\nthe white will be showing, so\nit's going to do that diffusing,\n\n460\n00:24:08.628 --> 00:24:12.750\nif you want to say,\nfrom being on, being off.\n\n461\n00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.370\n>> Okay.\n\n462\n00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.410\n>> So masking.\n\n463\n00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:15.360\nSo let me show you.\n\n464\n00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.800\nTake these two guys and\nI go ahead select them and\n\n465\n00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.960\nI'm gonna go ahead and, if I just make\na clipping mask it's doing the same thing,\n\n466\n00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.020\nso it's not really doing\nthe clipping mask.\n\n467\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.980\nYou need to go in to\nthe transparency panel, okay?\n\n468\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.390\nSo the transparency panel, here,\nis where if I have them both selected,\n\n469\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:39.250\nI can take them and\nsay do I want to make a mask out of this.\n\n470\n00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:43.660\nAnd if you, you click Yes and\nyou can see here this is where.\n\n471\n00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.870\nLook it's not a hard line,\nit's show and hide.\n\n472\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.430\nAnd it's connected to, it's saying this\n\n473\n00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.280\nis a picture that's connect to\nthe transparency or a opacity mask.\n\n474\n00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.680\nAnd it's showing me that.\n\n475\n00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.930\nAnd that's where I can clip it.\n\n476\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.550\nWhen I say clip, see it's actually\nclipping based on the dimension\n\n477\n00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.760\nof the square that I had\nwith the gradient in it.\n\n478\n00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.230\nSo, you could not clip it, but\nthat doesn't make any sense for\n\n479\n00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.350\nwhat I got right there.\n\n480\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.300\nYou can invert it, so black is white,\nwhite is black, there,\n\n481\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.810\nand I can have some fun with that.\n\n482\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.200\nNow, what if I don't like\nthis gradient going on here?\n\n483\n00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.730\nThis is where, up in this, it's kinda\nsmall, but you see how there's, like,\n\n484\n00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:25.010\na yellow box around this,\nfirst is not yellow boxed around this.\n\n485\n00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.480\nThis is a common thing that when,\nwhen I choose Photo Shop,\n\n486\n00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.530\nyou always have to know,\nwhich one am I modifying?\n\n487\n00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.810\nAm I modifying the image or\nam I modifying the mask?\n\n488\n00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.430\nAnd if I wanted to change like\nthe shape of the gradient,\n\n489\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.310\nyou gotta make sure you're on\nthe mask itself, not the image.\n\n490\n00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.320\nImage, mask.\n\n491\n00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.210\nI want the mask to be modified and\n\n492\n00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.870\nif I'm in the gradient you don't really,\nIt's easier to go to the gradient panel.\n\n493\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:52.720\nSo if I go with the gradient, maybe I want\nto make this a radial gradient, okay.\n\n494\n00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.310\nOoh, there we go.\n\n495\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.730\nAnd maybe I don't want, I want it where it\nshows and hides a little bit differently.\n\n496\n00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.390\nSo I can change the stops\non the opacity mask.\n\n497\n00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:05.780\nMaybe I wanna go ahead and add another\nwhite and make the kind of diffused edges,\n\n498\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.590\nif you wanna say, a little less,\nso just modifying that gradient.\n\n499\n00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.390\nIf you have the gradient on the mask,\n\n500\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.810\nwill allow you to do a couple\nof neat things in here.\n\n501\n00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:21.220\nSo changing that gradient and\nusing that with a mask and\n\n502\n00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.745\nmaking it an opacity mask can give\nyou some cool things that you can do.\n\n503\n00:26:25.745 --> 00:26:27.210\n>> Absolutely.\n\n504\n00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:32.410\n>> While I'm here, since,\ngo on to different things that you can do.\n\n505\n00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.290\nAll right, so.\n\n506\n00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:36.750\nI'm glad I'm doing this.\n\n507\n00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.312\nI'm like why can't I I can't\ngrab this picture, what's wrong?\n\n508\n00:26:40.312 --> 00:26:43.200\nAnd then am I in the clipping mask,\nwhere am I at?\n\n509\n00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.310\nIt goes back to here.\n\n510\n00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.680\n>> I'm still on the mask.\n\n511\n00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.450\n>> I see.\n>> So it's thinking well\n\n512\n00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.820\nthat's not the mask.\n\n513\n00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.940\nWhy are you clicking over there?\n\n514\n00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.690\n>> Can't work with it over there.\n>> Yeah.\n\n515\n00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.820\nI've got to make sure I'm back\non the image which really lives\n\n516\n00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.190\nIn the Illustrator files,\nso that's why I got it.\n\n517\n00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.790\nI started getting nervous,\nI'm like what, wait, what am I doing?\n\n518\n00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.310\nThat's why.\n\n519\n00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.820\nPerfect.\nSee I meant to do that for you guys.\n\n520\n00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.260\n>> Great learning experience.\n\n521\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.125\n>> Right?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n522\n00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:10.434\n>> [LAUGH] Totally planned.\n\n523\n00:27:10.434 --> 00:27:11.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n524\n00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.410\n>> So the other thing in the transparency\n\n525\n00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:19.410\npanel, you do have different blending\nmodes that you can use the same way in\n\n526\n00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.780\nPhotoshop, but\n\n527\n00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.860\nwe need one more piece before I can\ndemonstrate blending modes to you.\n\n528\n00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.160\nI did just like we had\nwith the opacity mask.\n\n529\n00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.620\nWe had to have that square with\nthe gradient on it to go ahead and\n\n530\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.810\nshow like the hides and shows.\n\n531\n00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.980\nHide and shows of the mask.\n\n532\n00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:42.290\nI need to make something that I\nwant to blend with this image.\n\n533\n00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.490\n>> It's difficult to blend a single item.\n\n534\n00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.065\n>> Correct.\n\n535\n00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:51.150\n[LAUGH] So I'm just gonna\nmake a rectangle quickly and\n\n536\n00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.660\ntake my little pink square and\nI'm gonna cover it over it.\n\n537\n00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.340\nI'm gonna make it smaller\nthan the image on purpose,\n\n538\n00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.110\njust for demonstration purposes.\n\n539\n00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.940\nOkay, so same idea.\n\n540\n00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.850\nYou got to have something on top of the\nother thing to make sure that you know how\n\n541\n00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.182\nit's going to blend.\n\n542\n00:28:05.182 --> 00:28:06.610\nAll right.\n\n543\n00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.620\nAnd it is with a photo draft,\nbut something underneath that,\n\n544\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.990\nunderneath part, it could be\na vector image or what have you.\n\n545\n00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.730\nSo again same idea.\n\n546\n00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.670\nGo ahead and select both of these guys.\n\n547\n00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.890\nAnd over here,\nI don't want to make a mask out of it.\n\n548\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.050\nI want to change the blending modes.\n\n549\n00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.490\nSo this is where what does each one do?\n\n550\n00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.750\nI'm not gonna go into detail,\njust start going down the list.\n\n551\n00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:34.290\nOkay, darken versus color\ndodge versus exclusion.\n\n552\n00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:35.860\nOoh, that one's kind of interesting, okay.\n\n553\n00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.790\nAnd so it's taking the pink square and\n\n554\n00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.100\ntaking the colors really and blending\nthem down with whatever's underneath it.\n\n555\n00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.660\nSo you can get some really\ninteresting results.\n\n556\n00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.050\n>> I was gonna say the options\nare endless there,\n\n557\n00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.150\ndepending on what you start\nwith that you're blending.\n\n558\n00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.120\nAnd then the different modes,\n\n559\n00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.145\nI'm sure a green square would have\ndifferent effect than a pink square.\n\n560\n00:28:55.145 --> 00:28:56.010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n561\n00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:57.140\n>> Wow.\n>> Exactly, and\n\n562\n00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.070\nthat's where I can go into here.\n\n563\n00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.360\nI just double clicked on this to get\ninto that group that we're using, and\n\n564\n00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.740\nif I change this to blue or\ngreen, yeah, exactly.\n\n565\n00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.090\nSo now you can see,\nwhatever color you start with is going to\n\n566\n00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:14.120\neffect the blending that you're doing.\n\n567\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:14.730\n>> Nifty.\n\n568\n00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.380\n>> Yeah.\nSo, neat stuff, very similar to Photoshop,\n\n569\n00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.520\nso when I said, you say wow, there's not\nthat much you can do editing a raster\n\n570\n00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:27.450\nphotograph, there's a lot of things you\ncan do that if I was trying to take\n\n571\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.900\nthe table out of the image and\nkeep the size.\n\n572\n00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.430\nI can't do that; that would be Photoshop.\n\n573\n00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:36.470\nI can clip it, I can put an effect on it,\nI can do a passing mask or\n\n574\n00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.780\na blending mode.\n\n575\n00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.830\n>> So let me see if I can throw some\nof the terms you've been teaching us.\n\n576\n00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.160\nIf I get this right,\n\n577\n00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:48.250\nit seems like Illustrator can do some\nof the non-destructive photo editing,\n\n578\n00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.870\nbut maybe not the destructive stuff,\nwe're actually taking away pixels.\n\n579\n00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.833\n>> That's a fantastic way of putting that,\nI couldn't have said that better myself.\n\n580\n00:29:55.833 --> 00:29:56.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> You're a great teacher.\n\n581\n00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.315\n>> Good job, you've been listening!\n\n582\n00:29:58.315 --> 00:30:00.780\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n583\n00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.950\nSo, those are pretty much I think\nthat's as much as you can do.\n\n584\n00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.010\nJust a few tiny little things and\nthen we'll wrap this on up.\n\n585\n00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.120\nAnd when I say wrap it up,\nwe're actually going to package it.\n\n586\n00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.180\n>> All right.\n\n587\n00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:17.690\n>> I wanted to show you\nthe linked options, and,\n\n588\n00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:22.790\nyes, let's enjoy Fuego in all his glory.\n\n589\n00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:27.230\nHe actually does sit in the tree that way,\nevery morning, and the neighbors come by.\n\n590\n00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.375\nHe's not in his outfit like this.\n\n591\n00:30:29.375 --> 00:30:31.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, that was Photoshop.\n\n592\n00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:36.460\nBut the whole idea of keeping your\nfiles in a native Photoshop file.\n\n593\n00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.110\nI think I had mentioned that in the theory\nlesson, the image resolution lesson.\n\n594\n00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.040\nWhy?\nCuz there's different things you can do\n\n595\n00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.300\nwith this, okay?\n\n596\n00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:49.920\nThis is a Photoshop document, or\nPhotoshop file that has been placed\n\n597\n00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:56.260\ninto Illustrator using the import options,\nand let me show you the final result.\n\n598\n00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.020\nOkay.\nIt's where I got this.\n\n599\n00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:03.150\nI've got the layers up here and\nyou can see that each one of these\n\n600\n00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:08.580\nlayers that I created in Photoshop\ncame in as it's individual item.\n\n601\n00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.080\nHis sunglasses.\n\n602\n00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.220\nIt's all grouped right now.\n\n603\n00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.670\nYou can see at the top that\nit says that it's grouped.\n\n604\n00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:16.790\nBut if I double clicked and\ngot into the group, I could take this and\n\n605\n00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.550\nI could change the size.\n\n606\n00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.760\nI could make it a little smaller on him.\n\n607\n00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.315\nThat looks strange.\n\n608\n00:31:23.315 --> 00:31:26.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can actually do some things with\n\n609\n00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.900\neach one of these imbedded image.\n\n610\n00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.544\nNotice also again,\nthat it does say embedded.\n\n611\n00:31:32.544 --> 00:31:36.646\nSo, it's kind of a neat thing you can do\nif you had layered Photoshop documents\n\n612\n00:31:36.646 --> 00:31:39.522\nthat you wanna do certain\nthings in Illustrator with.\n\n613\n00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:42.233\nSo, it's kinda neat that you have.\n\n614\n00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:48.230\nThose options of placing a linked, a\nlayered Photoshop document in Illustrator.\n\n615\n00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:52.158\nNow, the reason why I couldn't demonstrate\nthe whole placing, I have no idea why it\n\n616\n00:31:52.158 --> 00:31:57.290\nwill not do, in my Mac,\nit will not show me the import options.\n\n617\n00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:01.830\nI've tried restarting it, I really don't\nknow why it's not letting me do that.\n\n618\n00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:06.940\nSo, still on the look, but\nI do have, I went to my Windows\n\n619\n00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:11.700\nmachine to show you that if everything\nwas working properly on my computer,\n\n620\n00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.360\nthat when I went to the file place,\nwe would go to File > Place.\n\n621\n00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.820\nI have, it's not the best image, but\nit just shows Show Import Options,\n\n622\n00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.920\nthat checkbox, and\nI can demonstrate that point.\n\n623\n00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:27.640\nIf I do File > Place, and this is\nactually another picture that I had made.\n\n624\n00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.480\nShow Import Options, I should\n\n625\n00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.560\nget the next box right here that\nsays Photoshop import options.\n\n626\n00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:42.820\nAnd it can give me the option of\nconverting each layer to an object within\n\n627\n00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:47.340\nIllustrator, or I could flatten the whole\nthing down, I could import hidden layers\n\n628\n00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:53.310\nif I had them them, and then if I click\nOK and place it, this is the end result.\n\n629\n00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:59.240\nSo I could get the end result, I just\ncouldn't get the import options to show.\n\n630\n00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.680\nSo, it was just one of those,\nI knew what it was gonna do.\n\n631\n00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.760\nI was just trying to get it to\nshow you guys, so you would know.\n\n632\n00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.790\nAnd then I could do the different\nmodifications of each\n\n633\n00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:14.590\nlayered item in that\nPhotoshop placed image, okay?\n\n634\n00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.210\nAnd then the other file\nthat I have in here\n\n635\n00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:21.020\nwas just to drive home that point of\nwhere I'm going in the end result.\n\n636\n00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.690\nThis is like a little advertisement\nwe'll say, that I made in Illustrator.\n\n637\n00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:26.380\nIt's very, very basic.\n\n638\n00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.780\nI do have a linked CMYK 343 file.\n\n639\n00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:35.990\nWhen I export this out as a 72 RGB JPEG,\n\n640\n00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.980\nthat's what the whole\nraster image becomes.\n\n641\n00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:43.570\nDoesn't matter that it is 300 in here,\nit's all about the end result.\n\n642\n00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:48.699\nAnd when we get into the showing you how\nto export images in a later episodes,\n\n643\n00:33:48.699 --> 00:33:51.680\nthat's where this will kind of drive home.\n\n644\n00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.960\nI'll show you where you actually get to,\nso.\n\n645\n00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.810\n>> Very good, Vaughn.\n\n646\n00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.510\nAgain, another great episode.\n\n647\n00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.460\n>> We forgot something.\n\n648\n00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.174\n>> We did?\n>> Yes,\n\n649\n00:33:59.174 --> 00:34:02.640\n[LAUGH] I had to stop before we,\nwhat did we say we were gonna do?\n\n650\n00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.780\nWe were gonna package.\n\n651\n00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.440\n>> That's right.\n\n652\n00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.080\n>> Remember?\n\n653\n00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.360\nYes, we were gonna package\nthis wonderful file.\n\n654\n00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.122\nSo, didn't wanna go away with that one.\n\n655\n00:34:10.122 --> 00:34:12.426\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, this is the file,\n\n656\n00:34:12.426 --> 00:34:17.220\nlet's just get little Fuego back in here\n>> So this is my awesome file, I love it.\n\n657\n00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.070\nI'm gonna send it to you,\ncuz you wanna use this.\n\n658\n00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.305\n>> I do, I love Fuego.\n\n659\n00:34:21.305 --> 00:34:23.820\n>> All right, and\nI don't wanna miss anything.\n\n660\n00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.000\nI want the fonts.\n\n661\n00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.500\nAll I have to do is do a File > Package,\nokay?\n\n662\n00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.930\nIt's a very quick command.\n\n663\n00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:33.870\nI mean, it's the concept that takes longer\nthan actually showing you how to do it.\n\n664\n00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.232\n>> Where am I gonna put this?\n\n665\n00:34:35.232 --> 00:34:37.680\nIt's gonna go on my desktop.\n\n666\n00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:43.130\nAnd maybe just for making it quicker,\nI'll just put it on the desktop, okay.\n\n667\n00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.270\nAnd it's copying the links,\nit's copying all the fonts,\n\n668\n00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.440\nit's going to create me a report\njust letting me know that, hey,\n\n669\n00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:55.710\nyou better have the right options for\nyour fonts and sending things to people.\n\n670\n00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:59.120\nAnd then you click OK, and\nit says it's been shown successfully.\n\n671\n00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.980\nAnd if I show the package, you can\nsee that on my desktop I have this.\n\n672\n00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.410\nThis is what sends to you,\nyou get the Illustrator file.\n\n673\n00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.670\nYou get all the pictures in there.\n\n674\n00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.770\nSo all the linked, remember,\nthere was some embedded.\n\n675\n00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.250\nSo you're like,\nthose aren't all the pictures.\n\n676\n00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.020\nSome I did embed.\n\n677\n00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:16.170\nAnd then, all the fonts that\nyou would need for this file.\n\n678\n00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:19.830\nYou would get the package,\nyou would open this Illustrator item, and\n\n679\n00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:24.570\nit would link directly to those\nlinked items in that folder.\n\n680\n00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:25.780\nVery, very handy.\n\n681\n00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.685\nI love packaging in Illustrator,\nit wasn't always an option, so\n\n682\n00:35:29.685 --> 00:35:32.305\nwhen they finally added that,\nI was like, yes!\n\n683\n00:35:32.305 --> 00:35:32.995\nThank you!\n\n684\n00:35:32.995 --> 00:35:34.395\nSo I was very happy.\n\n685\n00:35:34.395 --> 00:35:35.075\n>> Very good.\n\n686\n00:35:35.075 --> 00:35:37.575\nAll right, well, now,\nanother great episode.\n\n687\n00:35:37.575 --> 00:35:39.635\n>> Yes.\n>> And we threw in packaging in there.\n\n688\n00:35:39.635 --> 00:35:43.845\nObviously, a very important part of\nthe whole thing as we get our document or\n\n689\n00:35:43.845 --> 00:35:47.565\nwhatever it is we're working on, ready for\nsending to somebody for web or for\n\n690\n00:35:47.565 --> 00:35:48.845\nprinter, what have you.\n\n691\n00:35:48.845 --> 00:35:49.785\nSo we thank you for that Vaughn.\n\n692\n00:35:49.785 --> 00:35:52.620\nLot a good look at what\nwe can do with images.\n\n693\n00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.640\nReally, maybe a little bit limited but\n\n694\n00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.420\nstill-\n>> A lot.\n\n695\n00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.290\n>> Quite a bit of things, yeah,\n\n696\n00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:58.830\nthat we can do with those\nimages within Illustrator.\n\n697\n00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.880\nSo we appreciate that, Vaughan.\n\n698\n00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.810\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n699\n00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.190\nSigning off of IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n700\n00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.753\n>> And I'm Vaughan Smith.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n701\n00:36:06.753 --> 00:36:14.900\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.660\nHello.\nWelcome to another exciting episode here\n\n3\n00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.270\nat IT ProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.390\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n5\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.120\ntoday we're doing Adobe Illustrator CC\n2015 and specifically in\n\n6\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.010\nthis episode we're actually going\nto be going over image trace.\n\n7\n00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.730\nI don't know about you guys out there,\nwhen I was a kid Love to trace pictures,\n\n8\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.540\nbut I don't think that's\nexactly what this means.\n\n9\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.800\nSo, thankfully,\nVaughn is here to help us with that.\n\n10\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.870\nVaughn, you going to help us\nout with image trace today?\n\n11\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.670\n>> I am.\nAnd actually, you introduced it perfectly.\n\n12\n00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.380\n>> Great.\n>> That's\n\n13\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.755\nexactly what we're going to be doing.\n\n14\n00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:43.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're going to be tracing images.\n\n15\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.390\nAnd it's really, we're going to be\ntaking a raster image that we place\n\n16\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.640\nin Illustrator, and\nconverting it into vector path.\n\n17\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.610\n>> So we are tracing.\n\n18\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.150\n>> Just, remember.\n\n19\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.010\nWe are! Yeah! >> With a little\ntracing paper and all of that.\n\n20\n00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.524\nGreat.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n21\n00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.460\nYeah, well we're, you put it and\n\n22\n00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.890\nyou have to tape it on the sides so\nit doesn't move and all that stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.400\nIt's really the digital format.\n\n24\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.190\n>> Fantastic, let's dive in.\n\n25\n00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.850\n>> So, I've got my handy overview files\nthat we go over each one of our topics and\n\n26\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.736\nit's like wow that's it?\n\n27\n00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:16.770\n[LAUGH] There's not like a huge amount\n\n28\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.080\nto go over in a sense of\nthe concept of what it means.\n\n29\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.505\nIt's raster to vector.\n\n30\n00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:23.550\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You're tracing and making paths.\n\n31\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.460\nAnd there are some presets that you have\nfor how Illustrator finds the tracing.\n\n32\n00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.210\nAnd where it's actually finding\nthe paths and making the paths.\n\n33\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.360\nSo you do have those options\nthat you can modify.\n\n34\n00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.770\nTalking about what it means\nwhen you're done tracing and\n\n35\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.390\nnow you wanna do more with\nit then you expand it.\n\n36\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.800\nAnd I'd like to go over how you\ncan make swatches out of tracing\n\n37\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.230\nimages that are in color.\n\n38\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.110\nSo you can kind of actually take\nthe colors out of the pictures and\n\n39\n00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.240\ndo some fun stuff with it, so-\n>> Fantastic.\n\n40\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.830\n>> That's what we got.\n\n41\n00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.500\nSo we're just gonna jump right in.\n\n42\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.690\nAnd a little disclaimer If I\nsay live trace at any time\n\n43\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.790\nthroughout this episode that's because\nit used to be called live trace.\n\n44\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.840\nNow they call it image trace so\n\n45\n00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.510\nI'm kind of back of what I\nalways knew it from the start.\n\n46\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.360\n>> Well that's good to know for those of\nyou who maybe have a little experience in\n\n47\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.790\nIllustrator, where basically this is what\nwe used to call Live Trace for the exam\n\n48\n00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.100\nand things like that, though know we'll\nneed to know it's called Image Trace.\n\n49\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.860\n>> All Image Trace.\n\n50\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.770\nAnd it has its own panel that comes\nup when you go to the options.\n\n51\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.530\nSo let me show you.\n\n52\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.660\nI've got a couple of art boards here and\nI've got a photograph.\n\n53\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.310\nI drew these beautiful doodles.\n\n54\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.440\nRight here to kinda show you that it's\njust something I just took a picture\n\n55\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.370\nof and\nI wanted to make this into a vector image.\n\n56\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.580\nI wanna do something with it all right?\n\n57\n00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.980\nSo I've already placed it,\nI have it selected.\n\n58\n00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.610\nNow wether it's linked or embedded it\ndoesn't really matter on that point\n\n59\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.910\nas long as long as they\nrast your file some sort.\n\n60\n00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.930\nAnd you can see right up at the top\nit's got the button right there.\n\n61\n00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.200\nImage trace, okay, so I take it and\nyou trace it, and poof, you're done.\n\n62\n00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.280\n>> That was it?\n\n63\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.660\n>> Yeah, and this one since I had really\n\n64\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.170\ndefined black lines on a very\nsolid colored background,\n\n65\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.910\nI mean, the default tracing precept for\nthis was, boom, there you go.\n\n66\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.380\nSo this was just an example of, if it\nworks perfectly on the very first time.\n\n67\n00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.120\nDoesn't mean, you know,\n\n68\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.360\nthat's a trace that you want is like\nit's not exactly picking what you want.\n\n69\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.140\n>> So like the ideal image\nto do an image trace with.\n\n70\n00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.250\n>> Yeah because in the simplest point\nis place the file, trace it, expand it.\n\n71\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.510\n>> But if I take a photograph it's not\ngonna have those same contrasts and\n\n72\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.610\nfine lines.\n\n73\n00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.660\n>> Yes because the preset,\nit's really just like a black and\n\n74\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.470\nwhite just trace the image and\nthere you go, okay.\n\n75\n00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.690\nSo let's just go over those\npresets right up here.\n\n76\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.620\nSince we are in the tracing\nof the image and\n\n77\n00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.320\nwe go into the Presets\nthat are right there.\n\n78\n00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.910\nYou drop it down,\n\n79\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.730\nthese are all of those options that\nthey've created for you as just let's go.\n\n80\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.900\nIf I went into,\nnow this is not a colored image,\n\n81\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.910\nso I'm not going to choose the 13 and\n16, I have other examples for that.\n\n82\n00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.290\nMaybe black and white logo.\n\n83\n00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.480\nAnd you're really just\nlooking at the traces,\n\n84\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.210\nthat didn't seem to do anything, did it?\n\n85\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.970\nSketched art.\n\n86\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.590\nOkay, you can see that it actually kind of\nshifted a little bit, if you're watching\n\n87\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.850\nthe lines of the hearts and\nthe doohickeys that are coming off of it.\n\n88\n00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.800\nIf I go to a silhouette.\n\n89\n00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.130\nNow that's not gonna work, is it?\n\n90\n00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.370\nThe line art.\n\n91\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.210\nSorry my computer's gonna\nstart thinking of it.\n\n92\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.360\nThat's okay.\n\n93\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.940\n>> A little bit thinner\non the vectors now.\n\n94\n00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.580\n>> Yeah.\n\n95\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.400\nIt's going through those options that\nI'll show you in some other parts, but\n\n96\n00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.450\nthese are just again the presets that,\nI like the black and white logo.\n\n97\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.840\nThe shades of gray,\nI really don't want the shades of gray.\n\n98\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.470\nSo that's actually picking up the color\nof the paper that was taken the picture.\n\n99\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.740\nSo I'm just gonna go back to the default\nand be like, that works for me.\n\n100\n00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.370\n>> That works best.\n\n101\n00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.940\nNow can you show us that those are truly\nvectors and that we can manipulate those?\n\n102\n00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.330\n>> Yes\n>> Yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.170\n>> If we expand, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.400\nIt's still kind of in\nthat half limbo world.\n\n105\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.430\nI'm still just looking at the and\ngiving in the tracing results.\n\n106\n00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.280\nIt's viewing the trace results.\n\n107\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.230\nSo, if I viewed the source image,\nit's still there-ish.\n\n108\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.210\nBut it's kind of.\n\n109\n00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.600\n>> It's like it hasn't been finalized yet.\n\n110\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.649\nYou're not committed.\n\n111\n00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:32.020\n>> That's actually a perfect\ndescription of why I would say expand.\n\n112\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.060\nI want to now become actual vector\npass that I can do stuff with.\n\n113\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.630\nAnd the expand button's right there, so\nI go ahead and expand and there it is.\n\n114\n00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.170\nIt does come in as a group so\nit's all these grouped items.\n\n115\n00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.000\nSo if you wanted to either\ndouble click to isolate it or\n\n116\n00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.320\nin this case I'm just going\nto go ahead and ungroup it.\n\n117\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.920\nI'm going to click off it so you can\nsee that fact everything is now a path.\n\n118\n00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.810\nNow this of course is a compound\npath because the hole's knocked\n\n119\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.450\nout of it which we talked\nabout is an advanced path.\n\n120\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.360\nOutline or\nthe dimension of the photograph.\n\n121\n00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.780\nThat's something and\njust to show you if I change this blue.\n\n122\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.310\nLike okay perfect.\n\n123\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.290\nAnd I could take each one of these guys,\nmaybe I wanna color\n\n124\n00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.160\nthese hearts in pink and I wanna make,\nI think you get the idea.\n\n125\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.190\nIf I can just keep on going and\nchange this,\n\n126\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.950\nI can make this different sizes so\nand so forth.\n\n127\n00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.325\nI'm getting carried away aren't I?\n\n128\n00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:27.400\n[LAUGH] I need to stop.\n\n129\n00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.770\n>> But you're having fun.\n\n130\n00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.780\n>> Yes, so it's just like all right,\nthat's perfect.\n\n131\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.760\nI've got this.\n\n132\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.520\nI can do whatever I want with it.\n\n133\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.620\nJust to kind of throw it into some other\nlessons, maybe we'll take all of this.\n\n134\n00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.475\nRemember making pattern swatches?\n\n135\n00:06:41.475 --> 00:06:42.430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n136\n00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.810\n>> Back in some of our other lessons.\n\n137\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.190\nSo I could take this.\n\n138\n00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.270\nNow I've got this little guy here.\n\n139\n00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.690\nTake all that and throw it into the\nswatches panel and now I've got a pattern.\n\n140\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.930\nI've even just got a little demonstration\ndown here of this little guy.\n\n141\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.860\nAnd then, ooh,\nnow I've got some really cool patterns.\n\n142\n00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.280\nAnything you wanna do with paths,\nyou can do it because it's paths.\n\n143\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:11.030\nNow, I wanted to go to some other\nexamples just to get into the options,\n\n144\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.290\nso here's another drawn image that I\ncreated with a good old permanent marker.\n\n145\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.220\n>> I think we recognize that.\n\n146\n00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.550\nWe all know that hop along hills, right?\n\n147\n00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.310\n>> It is, yes, you'll see this\ndemonstration some other places.\n\n148\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.160\nIt's the inspiration for it, yes.\n\n149\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.817\nAnd, cuz I like bunnies, so.\n\n150\n00:07:27.817 --> 00:07:32.610\n[LAUGH] So, if I go to the Image Trace,\ncuz I had the photo selected and I clicked\n\n151\n00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:38.560\nthe button, the presets are great, but\nthen coming into the Image Trace panel.\n\n152\n00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.400\nAll the options that I can go to.\n\n153\n00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.630\nGet even just more details\nthan the presets, okay?\n\n154\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.960\nIf I expand this advance right here\njust to you show where the corners are.\n\n155\n00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.280\nI'm not going to go through every\nsingle option here cuz really it's just\n\n156\n00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.560\npull to the left, pull to the right,\nsee what it does.\n\n157\n00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.730\nHow does it change what you're\ntrying to get out of it?\n\n158\n00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:08.200\nBut I wanted to point out a few things\nbecause in the default, remember the white\n\n159\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.550\nbackground, it became a result\nof our expanded trace.\n\n160\n00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.080\nThat's because it was creating fills and\nit was doing the fills,\n\n161\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.910\nbut if you wanted to\ntake off the fills and\n\n162\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.830\nonly do the strokes,\nin certain traces that might be good.\n\n163\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:31.920\nI don't want the insides of the heart to\nbe a piece, I want just the outlines.\n\n164\n00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.680\nThe strokes.\n\n165\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.520\nSo you can change that.\n\n166\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.230\nNow on this one it doesn't really\nnecessarily work the best.\n\n167\n00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.550\nBut then I can change the thickness.\n\n168\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.450\nAnd now you can say,\n\n169\n00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.220\nit's actually starting to come\naround if I'm putting a stroke late.\n\n170\n00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.510\nSo it's going to export,\nor not export, I'm sorry,\n\n171\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.630\nexpand out as a stroke,\nnot a compound path\n\n172\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.630\nlike the other result happened when we did\nthe trace of the hearts and everything.\n\n173\n00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.740\nSo that could be great if you wanted to.\n\n174\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.820\nAnd how many corners it's gonna have and\nif I start changing these options too much\n\n175\n00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.720\nI will say that if you have a very\ncomplex photo to start with,\n\n176\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.850\nit will tax out your machine.\n\n177\n00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.420\nAnd since this little\nbaby's a little older,\n\n178\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.330\nI don't wanna stress her\nout too much [LAUGH].\n\n179\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.400\nBecause then we'll just sit there\nspinning with the wheel, okay.\n\n180\n00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.210\nSo you could go through all\nof these different options,\n\n181\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:28.265\nstarting with some of the presets and\ngo from there to get the exact\n\n182\n00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:33.185\nresult that you want to\nhave from your image trace.\n\n183\n00:09:33.185 --> 00:09:36.185\nAnd for demonstration purposes,\nI'll just end with that.\n\n184\n00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:37.405\nThat sounds good.\n\n185\n00:09:37.405 --> 00:09:40.735\nI'll close the panel cause that's there.\n\n186\n00:09:40.735 --> 00:09:44.815\nAnd then I expand it,\nto show you that now with this group,\n\n187\n00:09:44.815 --> 00:09:49.020\nif I ungroup this,\nyou see how this is This is a stroke.\n\n188\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.350\nIt's not fill, like the compound\npath that was in the other result.\n\n189\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.780\nAnd then I can change it is a stroke,\nrather than a closed path.\n\n190\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.830\nThis is an open path.\n\n191\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.290\nThe other ones were clothes paths.\n\n192\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:01.970\nOkay, all right.\n\n193\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.670\nSo let's move on to a photograph\nlike a color photograph.\n\n194\n00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.390\nThey're the stars of the show,\naren't they?\n\n195\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.150\nYes.\nYes.\n\n196\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.210\nLittle guys.\n\n197\n00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.960\nSo, I got my pictures,\nI'm going to image trace it.\n\n198\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.300\nWell, if I was.\n\n199\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.220\nMaybe some crazy pop art thing.\n\n200\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.950\nThat might be cute, but\nI want it to actually have the colors and\n\n201\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.570\nmaybe look a little bit more like a photo.\n\n202\n00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.670\nSo you can go into some of your presets.\n\n203\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.460\nIf I choose high fidelity photo, we will\nspin for a little bit because it's going\n\n204\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:40.500\nto try to create as many colors and\nsmall little paths as possible to\n\n205\n00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.870\nmake this as photo like but\nyet still have paths going on.\n\n206\n00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.268\nSo, just for you know,\ndon't want to, you know.\n\n207\n00:10:50.268 --> 00:10:52.870\n>> In our 30 minute episode, we might\nnot want to wait for it to render.\n\n208\n00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:57.005\n>> Yeah, we'd have to do a lot of filler\ntalk in and we don't want to do that.\n\n209\n00:10:57.005 --> 00:10:59.760\n[LAUGH] But I will go to see\nthat the six colored ones.\n\n210\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.520\nIt's looking at it and analyzing all\nthe picture colors and saying okay,\n\n211\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.610\nnow what can I make to make six\ncolors out of this photograph.\n\n212\n00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.440\nThere you go.\n\n213\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.800\nSo it just helps you see the oranges,\nyou can see the whites and everything.\n\n214\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.160\nMaybe with 16 of course i'll make more.\n\n215\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.140\nAnd you can go through the options\nthere as well, so, see.\n\n216\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.860\nSee, we gotta make some.\n\n217\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.730\n>> Very cool, so yeah.\n\n218\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:22.320\n>> Some filler space.\n\n219\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.860\n>> While that's rendering then,\nbut once that's done,\n\n220\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.470\nyou could then manipulate those vectors\nlike we did in our other episodes.\n\n221\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.460\nIf I needed to tweak something within\nthat photo without taking over to say,\n\n222\n00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:39.075\nPhotoshop some raster based program and\nusing my Tools there.\n\n223\n00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:41.940\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, and\nthese are now going to be vectors.\n\n224\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.790\nIt's not going to be raster information.\n\n225\n00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.180\nSo I got this-\n>> Which also means,\n\n226\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.900\nwe've talked about scalability\non vector objects, right?\n\n227\n00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.950\nNow if you had to blow\nthis up to poster size,\n\n228\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.310\nyou wouldn't lose that detail\nlike you would with a raster.\n\n229\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.360\nYeah, especially if you were doing\nthis as a really large format.\n\n230\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.250\nMaybe you're putting this as an\nadvertisement on the side of a building,\n\n231\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.210\nsomething to that effect.\n\n232\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.990\nFrom far away, from the street view,\nit probably looks like a photograph.\n\n233\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.390\nBut if you get up really close to it,\nyou can actually see the shapes.\n\n234\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.720\nAnd so like here, if I expand it,\nit's like, whoa, that's a lot of.\n\n235\n00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.490\nIf I zoom, zoom in like every single\nlittle part of the colors has combined\n\n236\n00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.870\ntogether to make individual little shapes,\nthey're all kind of put together.\n\n237\n00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.190\nAnd it's a neat look,\nyou've seen this look.\n\n238\n00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:30.540\nI've seen this on commercials and\ndifferent advertisements, this is a look.\n\n239\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.460\nThere's a reason why you probably want\nto do that, so if I ungroup this and\n\n240\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.510\nthis is where.\n\n241\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.860\nYou know, I can then take this,\nand remember from other episodes,\n\n242\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.030\nwe talked about how you can\nselect the same fill color and\n\n243\n00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.110\nthen I can go ahead and you know, make\nthis you know, red or something like that.\n\n244\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:52.200\nSo now it's just kind of,\nthat's a little scary, let's not do that.\n\n245\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.830\nSo I can take that and\nmanipulate the different colors like and\n\n246\n00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.770\nthis is where another thing,\ntalking about making swatches.\n\n247\n00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.610\nIf I have this color\nphotograph that's all trace,\n\n248\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.870\nI got all these images,\nor all these, sorry.\n\n249\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.190\nIt's not images, are they?\n\n250\n00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.382\nThey're vector paths.\n\n251\n00:13:07.382 --> 00:13:11.820\n[LAUGH] So if I take here, select them\nall, I can actually move this in.\n\n252\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.400\nThat's the wrong one I want to do,\nthat was not what you were supposed to do.\n\n253\n00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.320\nI'm sorry.\nYou're supposed to make\n\n254\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.710\nthe color group right here.\n\n255\n00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.100\nIf I haven't,\nI can make a new color group and\n\n256\n00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.160\nI can actually take the selected art\nwork and create swatches out of it.\n\n257\n00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.000\nAnd talking about global swatches,\nremember we wanted to change the colors?\n\n258\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.140\nThat's the whole idea of it's\nlinked to whatever swatch is there.\n\n259\n00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.770\nSo I click OK.\n\n260\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:39.272\nNow, I've got a whole group of\nall the colors that are in this\n\n261\n00:13:39.272 --> 00:13:44.770\nart board with these paths and so\nif I wanted to change that color,\n\n262\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.360\nif I just change the global swatch and\nthrow that in there like.\n\n263\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.370\nSo now everywhere where\nthat colors lives I can\n\n264\n00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.120\nchange from the source\nfrom the global swatch.\n\n265\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.680\nYou can have a lot of fun.\n\n266\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.530\nI love.\n\n267\n00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.600\nI just think it's so much fun and\nstarting with images that are,\n\n268\n00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.480\nyou know line graphics with the black and\nwhite and tracing that in.\n\n269\n00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.960\nYou can get some really great results and\nthen you can modify it.\n\n270\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.370\nAnd then in the next episodes we're\ngoing to talk about live paint.\n\n271\n00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.670\nAnd that's almost like paint by numbers.\n\n272\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.290\nRemember that?\n\n273\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.330\nSo you take a black and\nwhite line image, you go ahead and\n\n274\n00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.870\nbring it into Illustrator.\n\n275\n00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.840\nYou live, sorry, image trace it.\n\n276\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.840\nI almost said live trace.\n\n277\n00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.540\nYou image trace it and then you go ahead\nand throw it into a live paint group and\n\n278\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.060\nyou can paint it all up and\nit's just like poof there you go.\n\n279\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.850\nIt's awesome\n>> Very cool, looking forward to that.\n\n280\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.940\nAll right, Von, well a great look\nat what we can do with image trace.\n\n281\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.900\nTaking that raster based Photograph and\n\n282\n00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.370\nthen converting it into vectors with\nas much or as little detail as we need.\n\n283\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.790\nAs well as, depending on how much\ntime you have to let that guy render.\n\n284\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.550\nSo thank you for that.\n\n285\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.730\nGreat demonstrations there.\n\n286\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:49.680\n>> Thank you.\n>> Hope everybody\n\n287\n00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.010\nout there enjoyed watching.\n\n288\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.510\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n289\n00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.825\n>> And I'm Von Smith\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:16.587\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.587 --> 00:00:20.153\nToday, we're doing\nAdobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:24.820\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at Live Paint.\n\n6\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.424\nI don't think we're painting anything\nthat's alive, but we'll see.\n\n7\n00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:30.337\nHere to help us with that is Ms.\nVonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:31.206\nHow are you doing, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:33.549\n>> [LAUGH] I'm good,\nwe're not gonna be painting anything live.\n\n10\n00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:36.364\n>> [LAUGH] Models come in please, no.\n\n11\n00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:38.337\n>> No, not like that.\n\n12\n00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:39.422\n>> Okay.\n>> Actually it's gonna be\n\n13\n00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:40.299\nmore like the paint by number.\n\n14\n00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:41.043\nRemember those?\n\n15\n00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:41.838\n>> Yes, I do.\n\n16\n00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:42.711\n>> Fun.\n>> I love those.\n\n17\n00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:45.752\n>> Yes, where all the little colors and\nyou want this and you want that,\n\n18\n00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:47.751\nand you paint in a little box and\neverything.\n\n19\n00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:48.796\n>> All that is coming back.\n\n20\n00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:51.419\nIt's like an adult way of relaxation,\nright?\n\n21\n00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:53.340\nSo here we go with the Illustrator.\n\n22\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.379\n>> Yeah, so it's digital paint by number.\n\n23\n00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.075\n>> All right.\n\n24\n00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:59.953\n>> So it's just exactly what I said.\n\n25\n00:00:59.953 --> 00:01:03.853\nThese are the spaces I wanted then\njust kind of fill them in and\n\n26\n00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:05.938\nthat's really it, honestly.\n\n27\n00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:11.136\n[LAUGH] So let's get into the overview so\nwe can just jump right in.\n\n28\n00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:16.444\nLive Paint,\nanything can be a Live Paint group.\n\n29\n00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:18.752\nAnd I already said Live Paint group,\nright?\n\n30\n00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:24.044\nIt's grouping our paths to create that\nskeleton, if you want to say that,\n\n31\n00:01:24.044 --> 00:01:29.260\nframework, that outline,\nwe're gonna paint in the different places.\n\n32\n00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.290\nAnd you know that you have something in a\nLive Paint group, one by of course always\n\n33\n00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.170\nlooking at the Tool Options Bar,\nthat we always like to do for everything.\n\n34\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.574\nBut you'll see this little asterisks or\n\n35\n00:01:40.574 --> 00:01:44.755\nthese little stars in the squares of\nthe corners of the selected item.\n\n36\n00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:45.550\n>> Okay.\n\n37\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.120\n>> I'll show you guys, but\nthat's a big indication that you know that\n\n38\n00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.313\nthis is the paint group, and\nhow do you make a Live Paint group?\n\n39\n00:01:56.313 --> 00:02:00.454\nTwo ways, you select the items and you can\neither click with a Live Paint bucket.\n\n40\n00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:04.093\nBecause that's where we're gonna be\nfilling in those little pieces or\n\n41\n00:02:04.093 --> 00:02:07.680\nyou can go to the Object menu, and\ngo into the make with the Live Paint.\n\n42\n00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.480\nThe terminology that we'll be using when\nwe're in a Live Paint groups is faces and\n\n43\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.044\nedges.\n\n44\n00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:18.835\nAgain, that's kind of one of those,\nthat's a test question maybe.\n\n45\n00:02:18.835 --> 00:02:19.709\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.316\n>> So you have faces would be\nthe insides that fills and\n\n47\n00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:27.325\nthe edges would be the outsides.\n\n48\n00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:32.307\nYou can alternate between formatting\nthe face or the edge by holding either\n\n49\n00:02:32.307 --> 00:02:36.576\nthe alt or the option key when\nyou're in the Live Paint bucket and\n\n50\n00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:40.629\nyou'll see the indication change\nby the mouse cursor icon.\n\n51\n00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.341\nAnd just like we had in the live trace,\nthere are a lot of things to expand it,\n\n52\n00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:47.067\nthat's actually taking it\nout of the Live Paint group,\n\n53\n00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:49.463\nwanting to get into\nthe individual components.\n\n54\n00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:54.303\nIt will expand out the faces and\nthe edges as separate groups and\n\n55\n00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:58.700\nthere's something in Live Paint\nknown as Gap options.\n\n56\n00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.047\nSo that's the little overview,\nlet's go ahead and get into this.\n\n57\n00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:04.489\nI have just a very simple what?\n\n58\n00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.921\nWe've got four squares here?\n\n59\n00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:09.756\nSo this is what I want to\nbecome my Live Paint group and\n\n60\n00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:13.150\nI'm going to pick all\nthe little pieces out.\n\n61\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.920\nSo I'm gonna select all of that and\nyou can see, just by selecting where\n\n62\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.200\nthe paths are by the blue\noutlines of any selected objects.\n\n63\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.690\nThere's pieces right here that look\nlike I could fill those things in.\n\n64\n00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.440\nWell there you go,\nthat's going to be our Live Paint group.\n\n65\n00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.270\nSo I've selected them, your Live Paint\nbucket is hidden underneath your inside of\n\n66\n00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.794\nthe shape builder group.\n\n67\n00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:38.780\nSo there's our Live Paint bucket,\nI'm gonna grab that guy.\n\n68\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.450\nI'm gonna come over here and\nyou can see as soon as I hover over it,\n\n69\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.860\nthere will be a little tool tip that says,\nclick to make a live paint group.\n\n70\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.750\nSo I'm gonna do that,\n\n71\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.800\nI'm gonna go ahead and click, and\nnow I know this is a Live Paint.\n\n72\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.552\nAnd when I hover over it with the Live\nPaint bucket, it's actually creating and\n\n73\n00:03:54.552 --> 00:03:57.240\nhighlighting if you wanna say,\nit's showing me yep,\n\n74\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.376\nI found that I had detected that this\nis a place that I could fill in or\n\n75\n00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:02.630\nI could fill in there or\nthere or there or there.\n\n76\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.153\nSo it's almost like the pathfinder where\nit's actually finding the paths and\n\n77\n00:04:07.153 --> 00:04:10.950\nnow creating fillable faces\nof a Live Paint group.\n\n78\n00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.710\nTo show you that asterisk thing I was\ntalking about, I'm gonna go back to\n\n79\n00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.450\nthe black arrow tool and it might be yeah,\nI think you can probably see that.\n\n80\n00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.020\nYou see how it's kinda got a little\nasterisk in the square of the selected\n\n81\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.790\nitem and of course, up here it does\ntell me that this is a Live Paint.\n\n82\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.245\nSo those are our two indications,\nI'm gonna go back over to our Live Paint\n\n83\n00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:34.001\nbucket because that's the tool that we\nuse to go ahead and fill in those pieces.\n\n84\n00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.638\nAnd now it's just picking the color or\n\n85\n00:04:36.638 --> 00:04:41.205\nswatch that you want to use to fill\nin with that particular color.\n\n86\n00:04:41.205 --> 00:04:45.726\nSo I'll pick like a purple, and you see\nif I start hovering over I want that,\n\n87\n00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:49.625\nyou just click, click, click,\nsee, paint by number, right?\n\n88\n00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:51.612\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I want that, and I want that, and\n\n89\n00:04:51.612 --> 00:04:52.740\nyou can just keep on going.\n\n90\n00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.517\nAnd now you can see that there's\na tiny strip on top of the Live Paint\n\n91\n00:04:57.517 --> 00:05:01.460\nbucket that has like\nthree colors in there.\n\n92\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.970\nThis is where if you didn't want to\ngo over to the Swatches panel, and\n\n93\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.460\npick the color from there.\n\n94\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.357\nYou can use your keyboard to cycle\nthrough the different swatches that\n\n95\n00:05:11.357 --> 00:05:15.184\nare on your Swatches panel\nin that little indication.\n\n96\n00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:19.960\nYou see the middle one, the middle one\nis going to be the one that shows you\n\n97\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.580\nwhat color you will have ready in your\nLive Paint bucket to get ahead and\n\n98\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.085\nfill into that piece.\n\n99\n00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:28.564\n>> Interesting and you can even see\nit changing in the Swatch panel and\n\n100\n00:05:28.564 --> 00:05:29.543\nyou cycle through those.\n\n101\n00:05:29.543 --> 00:05:31.626\n>> Yep, that's why I wanted\nto bring up both of them.\n\n102\n00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:34.690\n[LAUGH] And you can use the up and\ndown and left and right.\n\n103\n00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.460\nAnd so you can see that it\ngoes through the down or\n\n104\n00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.880\nup goes through the regular\nswatches down into your groups.\n\n105\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.587\nAnd then your left and right,\nreally just kinda watch.\n\n106\n00:05:43.587 --> 00:05:46.044\nI don't know which way is faster,\n\n107\n00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:50.213\nit really depends on how close\ntogether the swatches are.\n\n108\n00:05:50.213 --> 00:05:54.968\nLike if you're doing a very analogous\ncolor or very monotone, you go ahead and\n\n109\n00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:57.777\njust use the arrow keys\nto maybe switch back and\n\n110\n00:05:57.777 --> 00:06:02.250\nforth to the shades of blue or\nthe shades of purple that you want to use.\n\n111\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.396\nBut if you're going like big jumps\nyou might wanna just come over to\n\n112\n00:06:05.396 --> 00:06:06.417\nthe Swatches panel.\n\n113\n00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:11.572\nAnd so this is a yeah,\ndon't look at the [LAUGH].\n\n114\n00:06:11.572 --> 00:06:14.070\nYeah, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nfinish this.\n\n115\n00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.484\nSo that was all the faces, but\nthe edges that we talked about,\n\n116\n00:06:19.484 --> 00:06:22.624\nI want to change the color of those.\n\n117\n00:06:22.624 --> 00:06:25.873\nSo that's what equivilates?\n\n118\n00:06:25.873 --> 00:06:28.930\n[LAUGH] Equates to what\nwe think of stroke.\n\n119\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.932\nSo if I change what I want\nmy stroke formatting to be,\n\n120\n00:06:31.932 --> 00:06:34.131\nI'm just gonna go in a different way.\n\n121\n00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:39.002\nMaybe I'll use this light blue,\nmaybe I'll make it 10 points to make\n\n122\n00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:43.802\nit a little more, you can see it better,\nthat demonstrate it better?\n\n123\n00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:49.013\nAnd I go there, if I hover over and\nI hold my Shift key, I did the shift.\n\n124\n00:06:49.013 --> 00:06:51.176\nYou know what?\nI just realized I did the wrong notes in\n\n125\n00:06:51.176 --> 00:06:52.439\nour overview, didn't I?\n\n126\n00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.285\nI did, okay.\n\n127\n00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:55.480\n>> We said the Option Alt key, didn't we?\n\n128\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.211\n>> I did,\nI realized where I just did that.\n\n129\n00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.643\nOkay, so don't go by the notes, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:00.643 --> 00:07:02.041\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:03.920\n>> I'll edit that in the final version,\n\n132\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.159\nbut it's the Shift key.\n\n133\n00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.957\nSorry, I realized I was clicking on it,\nthat's the wrong one, and\n\n134\n00:07:07.957 --> 00:07:11.420\nI actually kind of muscle memory,\nI went to the shift automatically.\n\n135\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.482\nAnyways, you can see if I hold the Shift\nkey, when I'm using a Live Paint,\n\n136\n00:07:15.482 --> 00:07:17.752\nit actually turns to a paint brush, see?\n\n137\n00:07:17.752 --> 00:07:23.125\nBucket, paintbrush, and\nif I start hovering,\n\n138\n00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:29.640\nnow the hovers are pointing\nout the found edges of it.\n\n139\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.750\nAnd if I click it, now you could see\nthere's going to start formatting\n\n140\n00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.430\nthe edges of this Live Paint group.\n\n141\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.060\nAnd if I change this stroke color,\nmaybe change the thickness,\n\n142\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.041\nthat's a lot, but there.\n\n143\n00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:49.009\nNow you can really see the difference\nthere of holding your Shift key\n\n144\n00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:53.105\n[LAUGH] to get to the formatting\nof the edges of a Live Paint\n\n145\n00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:56.005\ngroup versus the face with the bucket.\n\n146\n00:07:56.005 --> 00:07:57.927\nSo this is beautiful, isn't it?\n\n147\n00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:02.800\n[LAUGH] So if I'm done with this, and\nyou can keep it in a Live Paint group.\n\n148\n00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.790\nNothing says you have to expand it out.\n\n149\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.901\nI can keep it if I want to, but if I wanna\nchange it more, you can go back to here.\n\n150\n00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:14.557\nNow there isn't an actual button\nacross the top in the tool options\n\n151\n00:08:14.557 --> 00:08:17.740\nbar like you had in the Live Trays or\nthe image trays.\n\n152\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.300\nSo if I have here I can\ngo to the Object menu,\n\n153\n00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.210\nand I can go to Expand and\nthen I can go there.\n\n154\n00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.880\nNotice that it will expand the fill\nin the strokes separately and\n\n155\n00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.090\nthis is where you could\nchange it if you wanted to.\n\n156\n00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.030\nBut I'm just gonna go with the defaults,\ngo to there, it does make it a group.\n\n157\n00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:41.002\nI'm gonna ungroup this once and click\noff to show you that this is one group.\n\n158\n00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:45.324\nSee, these are all the edges,\nthese are all the faces.\n\n159\n00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:49.996\nSo they're individual groups and then of\ncourse you can ungroup each one of those\n\n160\n00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:52.757\nfrom here and\nthen modify each path from there.\n\n161\n00:08:52.757 --> 00:08:56.627\nAnd then that's some kind of crazy\nart deco furniture pattern, right?\n\n162\n00:08:56.627 --> 00:08:57.544\n>> That is, yes.\n\n163\n00:08:57.544 --> 00:08:58.402\n>> Maybe that's how they do it.\n\n164\n00:08:58.402 --> 00:09:00.154\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They just start just clicking around\n\n165\n00:09:00.154 --> 00:09:02.044\nand experimenting and\nthere we go, we got patterns.\n\n166\n00:09:02.044 --> 00:09:04.743\n[LAUGH] So that's-\n>> We'll see it in a museum pretty\n\n167\n00:09:04.743 --> 00:09:05.408\nsoon, I'm sure.\n\n168\n00:09:05.408 --> 00:09:06.558\n>> Right?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:09:06.558 --> 00:09:09.206\n>> Perfectly, so that's how you can go\n\n170\n00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:14.082\nahead and finished it with the expanding\ngetting out to the groups.\n\n171\n00:09:14.082 --> 00:09:17.640\nNow I did mentioned that\nwe do have Gap options.\n\n172\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.320\nBecause these are all,\n\n173\n00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.540\nI just made some squares, I made it in\na Live Paint group and that's fine.\n\n174\n00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.398\nWell let me show you another option.\n\n175\n00:09:23.398 --> 00:09:29.170\nSo this was a doodle that I\nmade with my permanent marker,\n\n176\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:34.620\nand then I took a picture, brought it in,\nlive image traced it, and expanded it.\n\n177\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.690\nSo these are actually expanded\nregular compound paths that we've got.\n\n178\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.657\nBut I drew this specifically that\nsome of them are closed, and\n\n179\n00:09:42.657 --> 00:09:44.808\nsome of them have little spaces.\n\n180\n00:09:44.808 --> 00:09:50.910\nSmall gaps, and\nI have like a perimeter of this too.\n\n181\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.085\nSo if I go ahead and select this,\nlet's go ahead and let's go the other way.\n\n182\n00:09:55.085 --> 00:09:57.090\nLet's go to Live Paint, we'll go to Make.\n\n183\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.710\nSo now I've made this into a Live Paint\ngroup, you can see the little asterisk.\n\n184\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.420\nAnd I come over to my Live Paint bucket,\nand maybe I'll go with the pink.\n\n185\n00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:13.775\nAnd you can even see from the highlighting\nlike this one, this one, but if I go here.\n\n186\n00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:16.586\nWell it's already closing because\nI think I have the options on.\n\n187\n00:10:16.586 --> 00:10:21.900\nBut if I didn't have that detected,\nit would actually go into the hearts.\n\n188\n00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.750\nSo let me show you what I mean,\nif I go into the Object menu and\n\n189\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.700\nI go into Live Paint,\nthere are these Gap options.\n\n190\n00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.460\nWhat are the options that you want to use?\n\n191\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.161\nSee, I have the Gap Detection on.\n\n192\n00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.356\nI actually forgot to turn\nthat off before we started.\n\n193\n00:10:38.356 --> 00:10:42.562\n[LAUGH] But demonstration purposes,\nthis is all learning experience.\n\n194\n00:10:42.562 --> 00:10:45.907\n[LAUGH] So if I take\nthe Gap Detection off and click OK,\n\n195\n00:10:45.907 --> 00:10:48.426\nnow if I go back to my Live Paint bucket.\n\n196\n00:10:48.426 --> 00:10:53.340\nNow you can see, that's what I was trying\nto show from the beginning is that\n\n197\n00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.474\nit's actually filling in that area and\ngoing into the heart and\n\n198\n00:10:57.474 --> 00:11:00.220\nthe circle that I actually want it to not.\n\n199\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.830\n>> Because it's seeing that gap and\nso that there's really no fill there.\n\n200\n00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.979\nThat's part of the background.\n>> Yes.\n\n201\n00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:05.794\n>> In its opinion.\n\n202\n00:11:05.794 --> 00:11:07.096\n>> Yeah, it's all one compound path.\n\n203\n00:11:07.096 --> 00:11:09.745\n>> Gotcha.\n>> Okay, so that's where if I did,\n\n204\n00:11:09.745 --> 00:11:10.596\nI just undo.\n\n205\n00:11:10.596 --> 00:11:14.344\nIf I wanted it to have the Gap options on,\n\n206\n00:11:14.344 --> 00:11:18.313\nlike I want you to stop and\nmake that close,\n\n207\n00:11:18.313 --> 00:11:23.962\nyou turn the Gap Detection on and\nit's actually finding it.\n\n208\n00:11:23.962 --> 00:11:28.498\nYou can see right down here,\nlike it's showing you where it sees,\n\n209\n00:11:28.498 --> 00:11:31.160\nwhere the gaps are located.\n\n210\n00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.300\nAnd you can detect whether you\nwant small gaps, medium gaps,\n\n211\n00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.310\nbasically the space of what it shows as a\ngap and where you want the paint to stop.\n\n212\n00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.620\nYou could also if you want,\nyou could close it with a path.\n\n213\n00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.470\nEspecially if you just had like lines and\n\n214\n00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.940\nyou wanted to close off with\nan actual path you could do that.\n\n215\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.162\nFor this one, I don't really want\nit to do that,so if I click OK.\n\n216\n00:11:52.162 --> 00:11:56.824\nNow back to the Live Paint,\nyou can see that that closes,\n\n217\n00:11:56.824 --> 00:12:01.660\nthe Gap Detection is on and\nthen I can go on my merry way.\n\n218\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:07.010\nAnd start painting all of my different\nthings because it has detected the spaces.\n\n219\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.962\nAnd now I can do it, and I can expand,\ngo on, make swatches, modify,\n\n220\n00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:14.388\nwhatever you want.\n\n221\n00:12:14.388 --> 00:12:17.300\n>> All right, great look Vonne,\nat our Live Paint and\n\n222\n00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.970\ntaking us back to our childhood\ndays in the old color by numbers.\n\n223\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.020\nWe thank you for that.\n\n224\n00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.890\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n225\n00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.202\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n226\n00:12:26.202 --> 00:12:26.900\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n227\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.863\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n228\n00:12:28.863 -->

00:00:16.497\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:21.472\nToday, we're doing Adobe Illustrator CC\n2015, and specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:23.768\nwe're gonna be taking a look at brushes.\n\n6\n00:00:23.768 --> 00:00:27.323\nOne of the important tools we have\nto use within Illustrator and\n\n7\n00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:30.160\nhere to guide us through this is Ms.\nVonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.745\nHow you doing, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:32.257\n>> Great, hello.\n\n10\n00:00:32.257 --> 00:00:35.443\nThe most important thing about brushes,\nbrushes are fun.\n\n11\n00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:38.538\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're just a lot of fun to work with.\n\n12\n00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:42.484\nAnd I think I've referred to\nIllustrator as a box of crayons before,\n\n13\n00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:45.817\nall the different colors and\nyou get the really big box with\n\n14\n00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:50.530\nall the different flavors in it, flavors,\ncolors, cuz don't eat the crayons.\n\n15\n00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.550\nBut this is one of those crayon\ntype aspects of Illustrator.\n\n16\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.800\nThey're just fun and they have a lot of\nones that are already in there for you.\n\n17\n00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.915\nBut of course just like swatches or\nanything that comes with all\n\n18\n00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:06.630\nthose fantastic libraries that we\ntalked about the swatch episode.\n\n19\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.588\nYou can make your own brushes as well and\nyou can modify the existing ones and\n\n20\n00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:12.539\ngo like that.\n\n21\n00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.898\nLet's dive into some funness.\n\n22\n00:01:14.898 --> 00:01:16.299\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sounds good.\n\n23\n00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.146\n>> Fun with brushes.\n\n24\n00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:19.557\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [COUGH] So\n\n25\n00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:24.617\nbrushes only apply to\nthe strokes of any path.\n\n26\n00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.998\nIt's not a fill thing,\nit's a stroke thing.\n\n27\n00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:33.100\nAnd there are different types of brushe,\nand it is a panel.\n\n28\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.900\nSo let's come over to our brushes panel.\n\n29\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.846\nAnd I'm actually gonna pull this out cuz\nwe're probably gonna be demonstrating from\n\n30\n00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:42.663\nthis a couple times, so\nyou can see this a little bit better.\n\n31\n00:01:42.663 --> 00:01:44.004\nSo with the brushes,\n\n32\n00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:48.997\nnow I have this file with brushes already\nin here that I've created a whole bunch\n\n33\n00:01:48.997 --> 00:01:53.410\nof them because as part of our notes\nis that brushes are file specific.\n\n34\n00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.993\nIf I did a File > New,\njust to do really quickly.\n\n35\n00:01:55.993 --> 00:01:59.530\nI don't have the same brushes here,\nbecause they are file specific.\n\n36\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.490\nJust like we talked about how\nswatches were file specific.\n\n37\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.170\nSo brushes go along that same idea and\nof course you can create your own library,\n\n38\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.560\nand then move them over if you're on CRB,\n\n39\n00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.770\nable to use them in file\nto file just like swatches.\n\n40\n00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.210\nSame thing here, and\nyou also have lots of libraries.\n\n41\n00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.140\nSo you have a lot of predetermined\nones that you can use, and\n\n42\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.910\nwe'll go into making our own and\nediting the already existing brushes.\n\n43\n00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.670\nAnd then going into the Paintbrush\ntool because the Paintbrush tool works\n\n44\n00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.870\nby whatever brush you have selected.\n\n45\n00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.740\nIdentifying the different types\nof brushes that you have.\n\n46\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.324\nYou have Art, Pattern, Scatter,\nBristle, and Calligraphic.\n\n47\n00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:44.202\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We were talking about this before\n\n48\n00:02:44.202 --> 00:02:45.420\nthe episode.\n\n49\n00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.526\nThat's a hard word to pronounce.\n\n50\n00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:51.357\n>> It's a hard word to say, cuz you really\nwant to start it off with calligraphy, but\n\n51\n00:02:51.357 --> 00:02:52.839\nit's not calligraphy.\n\n52\n00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.303\n>> Yeah, calligraphic.\n\n53\n00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:55.120\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n54\n00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.215\n>> We actually looked it up.\n\n55\n00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:57.519\n>> Yeah, we did.\n\n56\n00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.221\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We had\n\n57\n00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:00.468\na look at the pronunciation to make\nsure that we were saying it proper.\n\n58\n00:03:00.468 --> 00:03:02.644\nSo we're gonna just go\nwith calligraphy brushes.\n\n59\n00:03:02.644 --> 00:03:04.316\n>> There we go.\n>> So yes, that's how they are.\n\n60\n00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:08.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How you can identify each one of them.\n\n61\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.274\n>> Just from the Brushes panel.\n\n62\n00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:14.586\nYou see here in the Brushes, we have\nsome that are in squares, some of them\n\n63\n00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:18.847\nthat are in long strips, and some of\nthem that I call on railroad tracks.\n\n64\n00:03:18.847 --> 00:03:22.004\nSo that gives you a visual\nindication in the Brushes panel,\n\n65\n00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:23.400\nlike which one is which.\n\n66\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.170\nIf you have the ones up at\nthe top that are in squares.\n\n67\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.490\nThey're either a scatter brush or\na calligraphy brush.\n\n68\n00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.711\n[LAUGH]\n>> And how do I know?\n\n69\n00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.982\nWell they look like little pen strokes\nlike the actual calligraphy brushes,\n\n70\n00:03:39.982 --> 00:03:41.300\nthat's what it shows.\n\n71\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.564\nAnd if you actually hover over it,\nit's gonna tell you that it's like\n\n72\n00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:50.720\nthe different versions and\ntypes of calligraphy brushes.\n\n73\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.497\nAnd then when we apply you can\nreally see the difference.\n\n74\n00:03:53.497 --> 00:03:58.300\nAnd these right here, they just look like\nlittle items that are going to scatter.\n\n75\n00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.850\nSo a scatter brush,\nkinda what's you thinking?\n\n76\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.790\nit's gonna scatter all the every\nplace with this calligraphy,\n\n77\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.040\nit's gonna be like actual\npen that you're using.\n\n78\n00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.290\nThese long one, if you look at this one\nhere or that my zoom is actually too big.\n\n79\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.945\nSo those are going to be art brushes.\n\n80\n00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:18.140\nLong strips, that's an art brush.\n\n81\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.009\nThis guy with a little paintbrush\nthat is a bristle brush.\n\n82\n00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.410\nAnd then the one's at the train\ntracks down at the bottom,\n\n83\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.010\nthose are pattern brushes and I've got a\ncouple different ones to give you options.\n\n84\n00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.330\nYou see how in these ones you have\nlike the white hands versus the black\n\n85\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.410\nhand in there?\n\n86\n00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.080\nIt's because it's showing how if it's\na closed path how the corners will look\n\n87\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.340\ndifferent than the straight path,\nthe in between parts.\n\n88\n00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.340\nAnd you have one here where it\nhas a couple different ones and\n\n89\n00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.355\nthen you got this guy.\n\n90\n00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:55.400\nThat's what's it's going to look\nlike applied to an open path.\n\n91\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.660\nSo the different boxes on\nthe train track as I call\n\n92\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.390\nit indicates what it's going to apply to.\n\n93\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.120\nSo this is a square that has a scatter\nbrush that's already applied,\n\n94\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.760\nyou can see that it's highlighting\nright over here that yep,\n\n95\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.620\nthat's the brush that you're using.\n\n96\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.720\nSo if I wanted to take this circle and\n\n97\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.190\nI wanted to apply a brush to it,\nlike change the stroke.\n\n98\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.260\nI can click over here and\nI can start clicking through.\n\n99\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.748\nSee how these all scatter versus this art\nbrush that just kind of falls along that,\n\n100\n00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:34.619\nthat looks a little strange or\nmy bristle brush.\n\n101\n00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:36.593\nSo you can see the idea here,\n\n102\n00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:41.790\nof it's just applying whatever type of\nbrush to that path and changing it.\n\n103\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.470\nSo there's no white hands in here,\n\n104\n00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.500\nbecause there's no corners, and\nit's just different variations.\n\n105\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.120\nSo let me just grab this, all of these\nguys, and throw on this pattern brush.\n\n106\n00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.420\nSee, there's where you can really\nI got a little square in there.\n\n107\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.780\nDidn't realize it was there,\nokay, there we go.\n\n108\n00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n109\n00:05:57.677 --> 00:06:02.610\nyou can see that the Pattern\nbrush is really changing that and\n\n110\n00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.458\nif I apply, say,\nlike an Art brush to this one right there.\n\n111\n00:06:07.458 --> 00:06:15.524\nSee, Art brushes they look different\non a closed path versus an open path.\n\n112\n00:06:15.524 --> 00:06:19.886\nAnd the same with your\nPattern brushes you can see.\n\n113\n00:06:19.886 --> 00:06:22.330\nHere, let me bump up the stroke\non this one a little bit.\n\n114\n00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.490\nSo you can see there's a corner, and\nthere's that end of that pattern.\n\n115\n00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.680\nIt's a lot of fun,\nhow you can go ahead and apply the brush.\n\n116\n00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.766\nThese are all very straight, but\n\n117\n00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:38.770\nif you have curves it's gonna change how\nthe banner looks and so on and so forth.\n\n118\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.990\nThat's fun, right?\n\n119\n00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.495\n>> It is.\n>> We can do that.\n\n120\n00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:48.565\nBut what if I wanted to change some things\nabout these already existing brushes?\n\n121\n00:06:48.565 --> 00:06:52.624\nLike let's go over to here,\nyou see I have a lot of\n\n122\n00:06:52.624 --> 00:06:54.957\nvariations cuz I knew-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n123\n00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:57.290\n>> We would be applying a lot of brushes.\n\n124\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.626\nIf I go to this Grunge brush, I can change\nthe stroke size to make it bigger or\n\n125\n00:07:02.626 --> 00:07:05.789\nsmaller, that might be a little too crazy.\n\n126\n00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.011\nBut you can see that I can\nchange the stroke width,\n\n127\n00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:14.780\nit's gonna change how thick that brush is,\nbecause it is a stroke feature.\n\n128\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.620\nAnd in this particular ones\nI can change the color.\n\n129\n00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.720\nI can make it whatever color I want and\nthat's fine.\n\n130\n00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.241\nBut if I come over to say, let's take\nthese and go back to that star brush, and\n\n131\n00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:28.321\nI come up to here and\nI'm trying to change the color.\n\n132\n00:07:28.321 --> 00:07:35.234\nIt's not changing the color, well that's\nbecause the property of the brush itself.\n\n133\n00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:37.915\nIt's a coloring options,\nthis one is saying,\n\n134\n00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:41.209\nnope I'm not going to let you\nchange the color of the star.\n\n135\n00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:45.282\nAnd why is it scattering so\nmuch as opposed to maybe the confetti, so\n\n136\n00:07:45.282 --> 00:07:49.580\nthat the scattering options are different\nbut the stars are rotating.\n\n137\n00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.334\nThey're not falling\nalong on the same path.\n\n138\n00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:57.304\nThese are all options that\nyou have on scatter brushes.\n\n139\n00:07:57.304 --> 00:08:01.314\nThe different corners\nversus straight parts for\n\n140\n00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:06.407\nthe pattern brushes,\nthose are options that you can change.\n\n141\n00:08:06.407 --> 00:08:11.379\nLet's start with the colorization part\nof any of the scatter brushes and\n\n142\n00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:13.265\nthen how much it scatters.\n\n143\n00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:14.448\nSo how do you modify it?\n\n144\n00:08:14.448 --> 00:08:17.120\nYou just double-click the brush\nfrom the Brushes panel.\n\n145\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.440\nSo I'm just gonna double-click on here and\n\n146\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.800\nit takes me into\nthe Scatter Brush options.\n\n147\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.490\nAnd you can see I have what's the Size,\nthe Spacing, the Scatter, the Rotation,\n\n148\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.235\nand the Colorization method.\n\n149\n00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:33.257\nAnd you can see that the spacing\nis random or the scatter.\n\n150\n00:08:33.257 --> 00:08:36.600\nIf I change this to Fixed spacing,\nfixed scatter,\n\n151\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.290\nyou see how it starts to follow along,\nand it doesn't scatter as much.\n\n152\n00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.178\nThese are all things that you can change.\n\n153\n00:08:44.178 --> 00:08:49.426\nMaybe I wanna go ahead and randomize the\nscattering, but I don't want it so much.\n\n154\n00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:53.636\nSee, it's going from 40% to -60,\n\n155\n00:08:53.636 --> 00:08:59.424\nmaybe I can just make it from\n2 to really small like 64.\n\n156\n00:08:59.424 --> 00:09:02.780\nAnd now you see it's going\noutside versus contracting in.\n\n157\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.010\nPositive out,\n\n158\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:09.150\nnegative inside of where the stroke is\nbeing applied, change the rotation.\n\n159\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.300\nReally, I think you can get the idea here\nas you really just start playing around\n\n160\n00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.570\nwith it and\nwhat do I want it to look like.\n\n161\n00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.499\nAnd I also have the Preview on right now,\nso\n\n162\n00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:19.029\nthat's why I'm actually\nseeing it out on my document.\n\n163\n00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:22.517\nIf you did not have that checked off, you\nmight be like why isn't that changing or\n\n164\n00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:26.182\nif you didn't have that brush applied to\nanything, that would be the other reason.\n\n165\n00:09:26.182 --> 00:09:30.422\nSo the Colorization method,\nright now it has none.\n\n166\n00:09:30.422 --> 00:09:34.860\nWell I want to change to pink stars or\nblue stars.\n\n167\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.180\nSo you can either change the Tints,\nTints and Shades or Hue Shift.\n\n168\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.440\nEach one has a little bit\ndifferent variation, I go for\n\n169\n00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.550\nthat full color change so\nI would go with a Hue Shift.\n\n170\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.191\nTints and Shade would be like it's gonna\ntake whatever color it started with and\n\n171\n00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:51.177\nthen whatever color you apply,\nit will kind of mix it together and\n\n172\n00:09:51.177 --> 00:09:52.172\nchange that to tint.\n\n173\n00:09:52.172 --> 00:09:54.990\nThat's where we talked about tints and\nshades, adding black, adding grey,\n\n174\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.770\nadding white, those types of things.\n\n175\n00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.000\nSo if I go with a straight up Hue Shift,\nit's like yep, that's what I wanna do.\n\n176\n00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.858\nI've modified the Brush options, and if\nI click OK, it will give you this little\n\n177\n00:10:03.858 --> 00:10:07.832\nwarning that says, well wait a second\nyou're changing some options on our brush,\n\n178\n00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:10.470\nbut I've already applied\nthis brush to some strokes.\n\n179\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.934\nSo do you want me to leave the strokes\nthe way they were before you did\n\n180\n00:10:14.934 --> 00:10:18.601\nthe changing or\ndo you want me to apply the new effects or\n\n181\n00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:22.780\nmodifications to the ones\nthat already have that brush.\n\n182\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.756\nSo it's up to you which one you want.\n\n183\n00:10:24.756 --> 00:10:27.266\nI do want it to apply to those stars,\n\n184\n00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:31.131\nso I'm gonna go with apply to strokes and\nthere you go.\n\n185\n00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.881\nNow I can actually change the color oops,\n\n186\n00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:35.341\nI gotta select the items\nthat's why it wasn't changing.\n\n187\n00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:37.210\n[LAUGH] So I can go ahead and\n\n188\n00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:41.482\nchange the colors of the stars\nto the color of the stroke,\n\n189\n00:10:41.482 --> 00:10:46.842\nbecause I changed the Colorization\noptions within the Brush options.\n\n190\n00:10:46.842 --> 00:10:48.088\n>> Nice.\n\n191\n00:10:48.088 --> 00:10:55.350\n>> And so there's the Scatter options,\nwith the pattern brushes with here.\n\n192\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.326\nIf I modify this pattern\nbrush cuz it's the same idea.\n\n193\n00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:01.132\nBut you can see that the dialogue box for\n\n194\n00:11:01.132 --> 00:11:04.400\nthe Pattern brush is completely\ndifferent than the Scatter.\n\n195\n00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.675\nSo I wanna point out a few things.\n\n196\n00:11:06.675 --> 00:11:10.925\nHow it's actually like following along\nthe path, how its scaling itself, and\n\n197\n00:11:10.925 --> 00:11:16.245\neach one of these, remember the sides\nversus the corners versus the end.\n\n198\n00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:22.515\nYou can see here on a different icon like\nthere's one corner, there's the side,\n\n199\n00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:26.585\nthis is the end of a open,\nthat's the other end of the open.\n\n200\n00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:33.320\nSo you can change all of these parts\nof it, but what's this coming from?\n\n201\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.779\nThese are actually coming\nfrom Pattern Swatches.\n\n202\n00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:40.331\nThese are the only patterns,\nlet me come over here.\n\n203\n00:11:40.331 --> 00:11:42.620\nWhoops sorry, I have to cancel.\n\n204\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.160\nWhatever swatches you have,\nwhatever Pattern Swatches you have,\n\n205\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.490\nthat's what it's gonna pull from.\n\n206\n00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.747\nSo that's I always thought that was to me,\nI thought that was kind of strange.\n\n207\n00:11:49.747 --> 00:11:53.020\nLike it's going from a Pattern Swatch and\nnow it doesn't make sense, doesn't it?\n\n208\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.548\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's a Pattern Swatch, but\n\n209\n00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:56.356\na Pattern Brush,\nmaybe it wasn't that far off.\n\n210\n00:11:56.356 --> 00:11:58.278\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe it was something else does that.\n\n211\n00:11:58.278 --> 00:12:02.490\nAnyway, I know you guys got it,\nso I can go over to the Swatches.\n\n212\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.758\nAnd I could load other patterns or\nmake my own patterns and\n\n213\n00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:09.519\nwe've talked about making pattern\nswatches on other episodes.\n\n214\n00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:14.139\nBut I could take this little guy, throw it\ninto here, throw that into there sorry,\n\n215\n00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:17.690\nthe different sizes will\ntake the different patterns.\n\n216\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.670\nSo if I come back over to\nmodifying this Pattern bBrush, so\n\n217\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.630\nI'm just coming over to the brushes,\ndouble-clicking on it.\n\n218\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.260\nNow you can see the corner,\nsince I have a new pattern, I can use that\n\n219\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:36.400\nas the new corner or side or whatever\nI wanted within that Pattern Brush.\n\n220\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.165\nAnd I can go ahead and\n\n221\n00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:39.652\napply it to the strokes that it's\nprompting me to do right there.\n\n222\n00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:41.541\nAnd he's like whoa, okay,\n\n223\n00:12:41.541 --> 00:12:46.762\nthat's a little weird because of\nthe size of the pattern that I made.\n\n224\n00:12:46.762 --> 00:12:50.397\n>> Yeah, and we talked about that when we\nwere making the pattern before is that you\n\n225\n00:12:50.397 --> 00:12:51.950\ndo have to be careful.\n\n226\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.190\nThere, now that I made the stroke a lot\nsmaller you can see that it is and\n\n227\n00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.310\nwhy is it gray?\n\n228\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.613\nThat Colorization option.\n\n229\n00:12:58.613 --> 00:13:04.510\nSo I didn't go through and change the\nColorization option of the Pattern Brush.\n\n230\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.570\nSo Scatter Brushes, Pattern Brushes, and\n\n231\n00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.160\nyou can still do the same thing for\nthe other of the Art Brushes.\n\n232\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.940\nYou can see that if I modify this,\nsame idea, it's just\n\n233\n00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.870\ndifferent parts of where it's not going\nto follow along and choose patterns.\n\n234\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.117\nIt's just going to\nScale Proportionally and\n\n235\n00:13:26.117 --> 00:13:29.369\nyou can do this in\ndifferent options in here.\n\n236\n00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:32.778\nAnd the colorization method right there,\nyou can see that it's changing to tints.\n\n237\n00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:36.198\nSo just double-clicking on\nall the Brush options, and\n\n238\n00:13:36.198 --> 00:13:38.610\nyou can get into well the Brush option.\n\n239\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.801\n>> That's it.\n\n240\n00:13:39.801 --> 00:13:41.049\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n241\n00:13:41.049 --> 00:13:45.539\nwhat about making my own and where\ndid you find these wonderful brushes?\n\n242\n00:13:45.539 --> 00:13:50.107\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's start with that last one first,\n\n243\n00:13:50.107 --> 00:13:52.160\nthe brush cyber ace.\n\n244\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.080\nNow, when I'm in my Brushes panel and I\nwant more, it's down there at the bottom,\n\n245\n00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.490\nthe little place where I\ncan go to my Libraries and\n\n246\n00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.070\nI can go to all the different ones.\n\n247\n00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.300\nSee, the Decorative scatter,\nthose are always my favorite.\n\n248\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.666\nSo if you go under here,\nthat's where the star came from,\n\n249\n00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.873\nthat's where the bubbles came from.\n\n250\n00:14:11.873 --> 00:14:12.513\nYou can do some hearts.\n\n251\n00:14:12.513 --> 00:14:14.884\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I can come over and\n\n252\n00:14:14.884 --> 00:14:18.700\nselect maybe these two guys,\nand apply some hearts.\n\n253\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:24.280\nYou can see as soon as I choose a brush\nfrom my library, it does apply or\n\n254\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.530\nactually adds itself into the brushes\npanel for me to be able to pick later.\n\n255\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.333\nAnd I can just keep on adding on, and\n\n256\n00:14:30.333 --> 00:14:33.412\nthen I can go through the different\nlibraries through here.\n\n257\n00:14:33.412 --> 00:14:36.144\nYou can see that these are art brushes,\nthat's kind of fun.\n\n258\n00:14:36.144 --> 00:14:41.003\nNow maybe this one on a circle\nmight not look as good as\n\n259\n00:14:41.003 --> 00:14:44.106\nI'm applying it to an open path.\n\n260\n00:14:44.106 --> 00:14:48.861\nSo we can change it that way, and\nyou can go through all of these types of\n\n261\n00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:54.320\nlibraries to see all sorts of really\ncool pre-built brushes that I can use.\n\n262\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.610\nChange the options if I wanted to and\n\n263\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.640\ngo on my merry way of doing some awesome,\nfun things with my brushes.\n\n264\n00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.640\nBut then what about making our own?\n\n265\n00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:09.170\nJust the same way that we can make our own\nswatches, we can make our own brushes by\n\n266\n00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:14.060\ndragging and\ndropping them into the Brushes panel.\n\n267\n00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.690\nSo maybe I would like to have this purple,\n\n268\n00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.790\nwhoops, wrong way, I wanted this\npurple star to become a brush.\n\n269\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.055\nSo I just draw whatever I want,\ntake this, select all the pieces.\n\n270\n00:15:27.055 --> 00:15:30.545\nThis is only one piece, and\nI drag it into the Brushes panel.\n\n271\n00:15:30.545 --> 00:15:33.285\nAs soon as you get that\nlittle plus sign and let go,\n\n272\n00:15:33.285 --> 00:15:36.174\nit is gonna ask you what type\nof brush do you wanna do?\n\n273\n00:15:36.174 --> 00:15:38.445\nAnd those are from all\nthe demonstrations we just did.\n\n274\n00:15:38.445 --> 00:15:39.820\nDo you want it to be an Art Brush?\n\n275\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.724\nDo you want a Pattern?\n\n276\n00:15:40.724 --> 00:15:41.340\nDo you want a Scatter?\n\n277\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.365\nIt's not gonna give you the calligraphy\nand the bristle brushes,\n\n278\n00:15:44.365 --> 00:15:46.280\ncuz those work a little different ways.\n\n279\n00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.157\nHonestly with that one,\n\n280\n00:15:47.157 --> 00:15:49.215\njust choose whatever you have\nin the library to modify it.\n\n281\n00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:53.684\nSo try and create your own, so it's not\nas quick as doing something like this, so\n\n282\n00:15:53.684 --> 00:15:55.810\njust take the existing and modify it.\n\n283\n00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.550\nSo I can just say,\nlet's make it a Scatter.\n\n284\n00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:04.620\nI go through all the different things,\nmaybe I want to do some random scattering\n\n285\n00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:10.030\nand change the range of how it goes,\n\n286\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:14.280\nmaybe I'll make a Hue Shift Colorization,\nI click OK.\n\n287\n00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.861\nAnd now, if I go ahead and take this and\n\n288\n00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:20.837\napply it to a couple guys\nthat's a lot of scattering.\n\n289\n00:16:20.837 --> 00:16:23.821\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So maybe I might not want to scatter as\n\n290\n00:16:23.821 --> 00:16:28.320\nmuch but of course, you can always come\ninto here, and then we can just change it.\n\n291\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.510\nI can just go to a fixed one and\nthen put it back to close to 0.\n\n292\n00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.197\nApply it, and so now you can see\nthat it just follows right along.\n\n293\n00:16:35.197 --> 00:16:37.310\nIt doesn't scatter nearly as much.\n\n294\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.810\nSame idea with you could\ncreate it as an art brush.\n\n295\n00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:44.600\nSo you can take the same art work and\ncreate three different types of brushes\n\n296\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.480\nthat operate, however those three\ndifferent types of brushes operate.\n\n297\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.170\n>> Very cool.\n\n298\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.740\n>> So and just keep on going,\n\n299\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.060\nmaybe I wanna make a pattern\nbrush out of this one.\n\n300\n00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.975\nNow I've got a bunch of stars,\nso you can see if I take this.\n\n301\n00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:00.882\nAnd you see, I can just keep on going and\ngoing and making lots of fun stuff.\n\n302\n00:17:00.882 --> 00:17:02.463\n>> [LAUGH] I can tell you are having fun.\n\n303\n00:17:02.463 --> 00:17:03.863\n>> [LAUGH] I know I\njust realized I'm like,\n\n304\n00:17:03.863 --> 00:17:05.832\nI'm starting to get in to that design,\nthat design mode.\n\n305\n00:17:05.832 --> 00:17:07.722\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was like okay, nope, stop.\n\n306\n00:17:07.722 --> 00:17:09.395\nSo I'll go ahead and pause there.\n\n307\n00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:13.884\nThe last little thing I would point\nout that just like the swatches,\n\n308\n00:17:13.884 --> 00:17:16.877\nthat if we wanted to\ntake this amazing library\n\n309\n00:17:16.877 --> 00:17:20.050\nof brushes that I've\ncreated in this one file.\n\n310\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.887\nAnd want to be able to use them and\npull them up in another file,\n\n311\n00:17:24.887 --> 00:17:28.450\nyou would save out your\nbrushes as a library.\n\n312\n00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:32.790\nSo you can see in the Brushes panel\nfrom the four lines and triangle button,\n\n313\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:37.140\nI'm saying, I want this to be\ncarried over in other ones.\n\n314\n00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.430\nSo if I save it and\nit always goes into your Brushes folder.\n\n315\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.635\nDon't change the location,\n\n316\n00:17:42.635 --> 00:17:48.105\ncuz you want it to be pulled from\nthat particular application folder.\n\n317\n00:17:48.105 --> 00:17:51.160\nSo I'll just name it fun,\ncuz we're having so much fun with this.\n\n318\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now I've got it as my own library.\n\n319\n00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:00.590\nMeaning that if I went into a File > New,\nI just did a Ctrl or a Cmd+N.\n\n320\n00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:06.470\nI say OK, these are boring, we wanna\nhave fun so let's get our fun set.\n\n321\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.560\nSo I can come in to either which way,\neither there or here and\n\n322\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.700\nI can open a brush library.\n\n323\n00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:18.010\nIt is a user to find anything that you\nmake whether it's swatches, brushes,\n\n324\n00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.800\nand then later we'll get into symbols and\neffects.\n\n325\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.080\nThey all just go into the user define,\nso I can just go ahead and\n\n326\n00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.000\nload up my fun brushes.\n\n327\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.930\nHere they all are, and\nthen I can have these available to\n\n328\n00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:34.760\napply to any new artwork that\nI have in this new file.\n\n329\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.521\nAnd there we go, brushes!\n\n330\n00:18:36.521 --> 00:18:37.624\nFun, fun, fun!\n\n331\n00:18:37.624 --> 00:18:38.608\n>> Lots of fun-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n332\n00:18:38.608 --> 00:18:39.937\n>> As you can see.\n\n333\n00:18:39.937 --> 00:18:42.480\nVonne, we thank you for\nthat great look at brushes.\n\n334\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.140\nThe different types of brushes,\nthe options that we have available for\n\n335\n00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.720\nall those different types of brushes.\n\n336\n00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.668\nCreating our own brushes,\nopening up existing libraries,\n\n337\n00:18:50.668 --> 00:18:52.125\ncreating our own libraries.\n\n338\n00:18:52.125 --> 00:18:53.690\nAgain, a lot of fun.\n\n339\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.660\nWe thank you for that, and\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n340\n00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.270\nSinging off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n341\n00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.169\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n342\n00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:02.111\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n343\n00:19:02.111 --> 00:19:06.910\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:20.489\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.450\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're gonna be looking at symbols.\n\n5\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.880\nNotice that symbols with an s,\nnot cymbals with a c.\n\n6\n00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.880\nI was getting excited,\nthought we were breaking out the drum kit.\n\n7\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.700\nI was wrong.\n\n8\n00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.858\nSo here to help us with symbols\nwith an s is Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:35.942\nHow you doing, Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:37.086\n>> Crash!\n\n11\n00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:39.227\n[LAUGHS] Don't let one fly out that way.\n\n12\n00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:40.067\n>> That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:44.294\n>> So we're not gonna try to lose any\nsymbols in this episode we're gonna talk\n\n14\n00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:48.060\nabout actually adding symbols\ninto our Illustrator documents.\n\n15\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.740\nSo [LAUGH] thank you for\nthat fun little introduction.\n\n16\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.683\nI was in band, so-\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I know, I know.\n\n17\n00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:54.308\nThat's why I thought we were\nbreaking out the crash cymbals.\n\n18\n00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:55.602\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n19\n00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:57.862\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I wasn't a cool drummer-\n>> No?\n\n20\n00:00:57.862 --> 00:00:58.998\n>> So I played flute.\n\n21\n00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:00.594\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n22\n00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:03.570\n[LAUGH] But yes,\nwe're not going to be making music,\n\n23\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.200\nwe're going to be making graphics!\n\n24\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.600\nSo symbols, what are they?\n\n25\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.930\nWell, they're just instances, that's\nthe one thing that comes to my mind.\n\n26\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.980\nAnd back in the day when using Flash,\n\n27\n00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.705\ndo you remember when we would\nteach Flash back in the day?\n\n28\n00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:20.160\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n29\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.000\nFlash was all about symbols, and\nthe different types of symbols.\n\n30\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.371\nAnd you could have graphic symbols,\nyou could have movie clip symbols, and\n\n31\n00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:30.543\nyou could have another type of symbol\nthat I can't remember right now.\n\n32\n00:01:30.543 --> 00:01:32.730\nBut since we're not teaching Flash,\nwe're okay.\n\n33\n00:01:33.753 --> 00:01:35.205\nBut that carryover of,\n\n34\n00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:41.405\nthere are different types of symbols\nas a symbol and how you make instances.\n\n35\n00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.655\nYou will see that when we\nactually create our own symbols.\n\n36\n00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:46.930\nIt'll say, do you want it to be\na graphic symbol or a movie clip symbol?\n\n37\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.210\nThat would only make a difference\nif you were going over into Flash.\n\n38\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.667\nSo it's still there, but\nsince we won't be going in that direction,\n\n39\n00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:58.321\nI just thought I'd throw that out there.\n\n40\n00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:04.070\nAnd again that's where my brain goes to\nwhen I talk about symbol instances, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.490\nAnd it's really just like clip-art,\nkind of.\n\n42\n00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.690\nIt's created graphics,\nlike vector graphics, that you can\n\n43\n00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.800\ndrag out from the Symbols panel, and\nwhen you place it into your document,\n\n44\n00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.535\nit creates instances of that symbol that\nare all linked to that source, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:25.570\nIt's the same as global swatches or\nstuff like that.\n\n46\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.400\nYou can go to the source of what the\nsymbol looks like, edit the symbol, and\n\n47\n00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.490\nany instance of that symbol is going to\ntake on whatever formats that you do,\n\n48\n00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.850\nwhether you change colors, or\nsizes or things like that.\n\n49\n00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.730\nAnd if you didn't want that symbol\nto be linked to its source,\n\n50\n00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.910\nyou can always break the link.\n\n51\n00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.050\nIt's kind of like nope,\nI don't wanna be connected to you,\n\n52\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.130\nmom, I wanna go out on my own.\n\n53\n00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.694\nSo you could do that, so\nyou could break your link and\n\n54\n00:02:50.694 --> 00:02:56.280\nthen it becomes its own entity,\nits own vector graphic shape, path.\n\n55\n00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.090\nAnd then you do have lots of\npre-made symbols that come with\n\n56\n00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.370\nIllustrator in the symbols libraries.\n\n57\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.360\nYou can make your own.\n\n58\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.530\nWe'll talk about the 9-point scaling,\nwhat that means.\n\n59\n00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.620\nAnd then talk about the fun little tool\ncalled the Symbol Sprayer, okay, and\n\n60\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.110\nit basically sprays like spray paint,\nright, like a spray painter.\n\n61\n00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.270\nAnd whatever symbol you have, and\n\n62\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.290\nthere's some really cool little editing\ntools that you can do that's kind of fun.\n\n63\n00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.090\nSo let's get started because I do\nhave some examples right here.\n\n64\n00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.355\nSome basic,\nthis is just a regular star, and\n\n65\n00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:31.635\nthis is actually this was,\n[LAUGH] actually took this,\n\n66\n00:03:31.635 --> 00:03:34.785\nif you're looking at the brushes episodes,\nthat looks familiar, doesn't it?\n\n67\n00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:37.585\n>> Yes, it does.\n>> I actually just took the brush out.\n\n68\n00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:40.967\nI just took this and kinda dragged it\nout there and it just becomes a path.\n\n69\n00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:43.715\nYou remember, because of how we\ncan make a brush, which you just,\n\n70\n00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:46.555\nwe made a star, I think, dragged into\nthe Brushes panel, the same thing.\n\n71\n00:03:46.555 --> 00:03:50.040\nYou can take the brush out and\nit's just its thing.\n\n72\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.990\n>> That can be handy.\n\n73\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.610\n>> Yeah, it's neat.\n\n74\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.888\nSo that's what I did.\nI took it out, and then I ungrouped it,\n\n75\n00:03:53.888 --> 00:03:55.596\nand then changed the color, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:55.596 --> 00:03:59.190\n[LAUGH] In case you were wondering and\npicked up on that, all right.\n\n77\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.910\nThese are things that we're gonna use\nto create or make our own symbols.\n\n78\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.800\nI'd like to start with let's just apply or\nadd symbols into our document.\n\n79\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.390\nSo we do have a Symbols panel right here,\nand I have a couple.\n\n80\n00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.188\nAnd if I wanted to add that\ncool little pink flower,\n\n81\n00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:24.326\ngerba, gerbaba, I'm not even gonna try.\n\n82\n00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:27.840\nAll right, we're just gonna,\n[LAUGH] let's move on.\n\n83\n00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.330\nWe're just gonna move on to taking this,\nand\n\n84\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.820\nyou can see that I have added\nthis symbol to my document.\n\n85\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.460\nAnd up here you can see that in the Tool\nOptions bar, because we always know to go\n\n86\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.360\nthere, you have your instance of,\nyou can see instance of our flower.\n\n87\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.680\nAnd [LAUGH] it's telling us there,\nsee you can Edit,\n\n88\n00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.300\nyou can Break, you can Reset or\nyou can Replace, so different things.\n\n89\n00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.440\nSo if I wanted another one,\n\n90\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.820\nI could just drag another instance\nout of the Symbols panel or\n\n91\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.300\nI could just Alt+drag and duplicate\nit just like I would anything else.\n\n92\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.386\nAnd I can change, I can stretch\nthis one out, make this one bigger,\n\n93\n00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:08.832\nmake that one smaller.\n\n94\n00:05:08.832 --> 00:05:14.240\nBut they're all connected to\nthe same symbol source, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.530\nSo if I ever wanted to change\nsome colors of the petals, right?\n\n96\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.679\nI can double-click and it's actually\nletting me know, because I'm kind of\n\n97\n00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:25.634\ngetting into isolation mode, like I\nwould with a group or a clippy mask or\n\n98\n00:05:25.634 --> 00:05:29.530\nanything like that, it's telling us, hey,\nyou're editing the symbol definition.\n\n99\n00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.630\nIt's gonna apply for\neverybody, you cool with that?\n\n100\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.560\nYep, I'm good.\n\n101\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.140\nSo you click OK, and\nnow I come into here and\n\n102\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.190\nit's showing me that I am\nin that isolation mode.\n\n103\n00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.555\nI just zoomed in and I could go into,\nI could either, I'm not gonna ungroup.\n\n104\n00:05:43.555 --> 00:05:45.730\nI'm just gonna double-click one more time.\n\n105\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.570\nAnd maybe I'll go ahead and\nselect the same fill color here and\n\n106\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.690\nchange these to purple or something,\nsomething quick so you can see this.\n\n107\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.530\nAnd if I now double-click out here\non the ethernet, if you wanna say,\n\n108\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.470\nto go ahead and get out, or come up here,\nback all the way out and zoom out, you can\n\n109\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.790\nsee that, yep, every single one of those\ninstances of that symbol has been changed.\n\n110\n00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.460\n>> Sure enough.\n\n111\n00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.628\n>> So connected to the source.\n\n112\n00:06:14.628 --> 00:06:19.878\nAnd so it's got some great flexibility and\nreasons why you'd want to keep\n\n113\n00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:25.818\nthem all linked, but maybe I didn't want\nthis guy to be the same as everybody else.\n\n114\n00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:29.929\nI wanna break out on my own so\nyou could take that, any instance,\n\n115\n00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:33.770\nand you can break the link,\nand now it's just an object.\n\n116\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.410\nIt's just its own entity,\nso if I go into here and\n\n117\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.390\nstart changing the different things there,\nand I could go ahead and\n\n118\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.634\nselect the same fill color there,\nchange that.\n\n119\n00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.320\nOkay, you can see that double-clicking,\nget out.\n\n120\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.980\nThere we go, get out.\n\n121\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.820\nNo change, now maybe I want this to\nbecome its own symbol, right, and\n\n122\n00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.330\nmake ones that are connected\nto the blue ones.\n\n123\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.650\nJust like anything else,\nI can take this, for our brushes,\n\n124\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.375\nour swatches, drag and\ndrop right into the symbols library.\n\n125\n00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:09.389\nAnd this is where it will let me know\nwhen I'm making my own symbol from\n\n126\n00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:16.270\nfrom anything, do you want it to be, what\ntype of symbol, movie clip or graphic?\n\n127\n00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.593\nAgain, if you're not worried\nabout going to Flash,\n\n128\n00:07:18.593 --> 00:07:20.459\nthen I wouldn't worry about that either.\n\n129\n00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:22.562\nThere is something called\na 9-point scaling, but\n\n130\n00:07:22.562 --> 00:07:24.198\nI'll show you that in another example.\n\n131\n00:07:24.198 --> 00:07:27.536\nYou can name it blue guy.\n\n132\n00:07:27.536 --> 00:07:34.730\n[LAUGH] And you click OK and so now I\nhave my own version of that same symbol.\n\n133\n00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.130\nAnd so then I can have\n\n134\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.660\na linked version of all these\ninstances of now with this as symbol.\n\n135\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.537\n>> Neat.\n>> Yeah, and it's fun.\n\n136\n00:07:43.537 --> 00:07:47.033\nSo we can go through and find all\nsorts of symbols already created for\n\n137\n00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:50.590\nus in our symbols library,\nbottom right, that's the other right,\n\n138\n00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.261\nthat's the left [LAUGH] corner.\n\n139\n00:07:52.261 --> 00:07:54.822\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of any panel that gets you into\n\n140\n00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:59.806\nthe different types There's some 3D\nsymbols that might be kinda fun, like,\n\n141\n00:07:59.806 --> 00:08:02.500\nooh, let's get this guy out there.\n\n142\n00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.275\nOkay, that's a, yeah,\nlittle keyboard symbol.\n\n143\n00:08:05.275 --> 00:08:09.700\n[LAUGH] Which actually you don't\nhave a five on a percentage, but\n\n144\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.945\nsome weird version.\n\n145\n00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:15.610\n[LAUGH] So I can go ahead and add any\nof the symbols out here that I want.\n\n146\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.670\nNotice that from the library it's\ngoing into my symbols panel.\n\n147\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.650\nAnd we can go in and\n\n148\n00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.960\ndo the same modifications of the instances\nlike we did with the flowers.\n\n149\n00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.340\nOkay?\nSo I would like to maybe add a few more\n\n150\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.752\nflowers for a specific reason,\njust because I like flowers.\n\n151\n00:08:34.752 --> 00:08:39.132\nOkay, [LAUGH] so I just wanted more cuz\nI wanna get when we get into symbols\n\n152\n00:08:39.132 --> 00:08:43.658\nsprayer, I just want, I want to use\nthe white one because I like the things\n\n153\n00:08:43.658 --> 00:08:47.270\nthat it can demonstrate with\nthe symbols sprayer,okay.\n\n154\n00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.290\nSo we know that we can make our,\n\n155\n00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.680\nI can make a symbol out of anything\nthat I have on my document.\n\n156\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.840\nSo I can make the star symbol.\n\n157\n00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.370\nI can even make images.\n\n158\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.930\nImages can be created into a symbol but\n\n159\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.170\nI will let you know that it's saying,\nwait, what?\n\n160\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.720\nNo, it can't be linked, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.100\nI did that on purpose to show you that I\nstarted to drag it into the symbols lib or\n\n162\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.400\nthe symbols panel.\n\n163\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.740\nIt's like, wait, nope.\n\n164\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.480\nIt cannot be linked.\n\n165\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.172\nSo you would have to embed any image.\n\n166\n00:09:17.172 --> 00:09:18.232\n>> Okay.\n\n167\n00:09:18.232 --> 00:09:21.760\n>> Before you make it into a symbol\nin case you're wondering about that.\n\n168\n00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.860\nBut it did actually let us know that.\n\n169\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.480\nAll right, the one that I wanted to\nshow you here is the banner one to make\n\n170\n00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:35.640\na symbol out of, so we can show you\nthe 9-point scaling part, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.680\nSo I'm going to, before we start,\nI'm gonna make a duplicate of this.\n\n172\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.870\nI just Alt+drag.\n\n173\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.120\nSo here's one.\n\n174\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.210\nI'm going to take these mixed objects and\nI'm going to make it into a symbol.\n\n175\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.010\nAnd I'm not going to scale this one.\n\n176\n00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.965\nAnd we'll say like, no scale.\n\n177\n00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.792\nLet's spell that right.\n\n178\n00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:57.410\nOkay so that is one that does\nnot have the 9-point scaling.\n\n179\n00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.790\nI'll take this one, make it a symbol,\ndragging it in there.\n\n180\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.540\nAnd I will enable the 9-slice.\n\n181\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.076\nI think it was saying points,\nwasn't I saying, okay.\n\n182\n00:10:07.076 --> 00:10:08.192\nSorry it's slice.\n\n183\n00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:10.840\n[LAUGH] 9-slice scaling.\n\n184\n00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.440\nOkay, just remember the 9 in there.\n\n185\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.467\nSo we'll click OK.\n\n186\n00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:18.688\nSo two symbols with\ndifferent options on it.\n\n187\n00:10:18.688 --> 00:10:23.060\nI'm gonna take this one\nwhich is the no scale.\n\n188\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.780\nI don't think I named the other one but\nthat's okay.\n\n189\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.720\nNo scale, and\nI'm going to maybe squash this down here.\n\n190\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.250\nI'm gonna stretch it out.\n\n191\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.830\nAnd so everything is scaling the same way.\n\n192\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.020\nThe little, what do you call those,\nlittle flags?\n\n193\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.678\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Yes,\n\n194\n00:10:38.678 --> 00:10:43.378\nthe little flags in the end of the banner,\nthey're all scaling all the same, okay.\n\n195\n00:10:43.378 --> 00:10:46.720\nThis one if I start changing it\n\n196\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.080\nyou see how the flags are not\nscaling the same way right?\n\n197\n00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.250\n>> Really didn't squish.\n\n198\n00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:59.250\n>> Yeah, they didn't squish,\nyeah, because of the segments or\n\n199\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.870\nquadrants you might want to say\nfrom that 9-slice scaling option.\n\n200\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.750\nSo let's go in to editing\nthat scaling symbol, okay.\n\n201\n00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.510\nSo you can see that right here It's\nactually kinda divided it up into\n\n202\n00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:19.170\nthe different places that is allowing\nthings to not scale, and things to scale.\n\n203\n00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.480\nSo, anything in this rectangle right here,\n\n204\n00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.900\nthat will be allowed to scale and\neverything outside it, it will not, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.790\nAnd so that's where, here let me,\nlet me get out of this window just to\n\n206\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.028\nshow you the difference of this one,\nwhich is the no scale.\n\n207\n00:11:34.028 --> 00:11:37.483\nYou see that there's none,\nthere's no dotted lines.\n\n208\n00:11:37.483 --> 00:11:38.175\n>> No guides.\n\n209\n00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:39.371\n>> Exactly, and there's no quadrants.\n\n210\n00:11:39.371 --> 00:11:41.770\nSo it's saying everything is scaled.\n\n211\n00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.590\nAnd by the way I am double\nclicking from the symbols library,\n\n212\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.770\nbecause that's the other way that\nyou can get into editing a symbol.\n\n213\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.270\nIt's just go by double clicking to\nthe icon and the symbols panel.\n\n214\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.800\nRather than the instance on the page,\ndocument in illustrator.\n\n215\n00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.340\nSo just wanted to point that out in\ncase you are like wait how are you\n\n216\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.040\ngetting there.\n\n217\n00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.060\nThat's what I'm doing.\n\n218\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.860\nSo double clicking from here,\nnot in the new symbol.\n\n219\n00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.200\nHere is my scaling and so\nanything that I want to and\n\n220\n00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:15.940\nit was already there but I just wanted to\nkinda show you that you can designate.\n\n221\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:21.290\nDon't scale inside here everything,\nscale inside of here, sorry.\n\n222\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.017\nInside scale, outside of it,\ndon't scale, okay.\n\n223\n00:12:24.017 --> 00:12:24.660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n224\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.955\nthat way, you can change whether you scale\nit horizontally or vertically or both.\n\n225\n00:12:29.955 --> 00:12:36.528\nSo that's why this one will keep\nthe flags in the same place.\n\n226\n00:12:36.528 --> 00:12:41.088\nNow see it's kind of getting a little far\nwhen you do it vertically and maybe for\n\n227\n00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:43.990\nthis example the vertical\nisn't as prominent and\n\n228\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.915\nshowing this as the horizontal scaling.\n\n229\n00:12:46.915 --> 00:12:51.808\nBut that's the idea\nbehind 9-sliced scaling.\n\n230\n00:12:51.808 --> 00:12:53.073\n[LAUGH] Not point.\n\n231\n00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:56.173\n[LAUGH] All right so.\n\n232\n00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:58.844\nWe've covered how to make them.\n\n233\n00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:00.852\nNow I wanna show you the simple sprayer?\n\n234\n00:13:00.852 --> 00:13:02.495\n[LAUGH]\n>> You've been waiting for\n\n235\n00:13:02.495 --> 00:13:03.712\nthis haven't you.\n\n236\n00:13:03.712 --> 00:13:06.360\n>> Yeah, it's just again,\nit's one of those fun things.\n\n237\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.460\nI just like it.\n\n238\n00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.670\nI'm going to take everything that\nwe've got here and just delete it so\n\n239\n00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:14.700\nI get a nice big space before I can\nstart spraying all these symbols.\n\n240\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:20.500\nOkay, so the symbol sprayer\nlooks like this in the tool box.\n\n241\n00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.941\nIt, well, looks like a spray paint.\n\n242\n00:13:22.941 --> 00:13:23.570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n243\n00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.870\n>> So I take this, and I'm going\nto tear off this group of tools so\n\n244\n00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.630\nwe can see all the fun options.\n\n245\n00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:36.364\nYour symbol sprayer will spray\nthe symbol you have selected.\n\n246\n00:13:36.364 --> 00:13:38.610\nI have to say that a lot.\n\n247\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.480\nSo I'm gonna pick the daisy.\n\n248\n00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.952\nNow here's a flower that I can pronounce.\n\n249\n00:13:41.952 --> 00:13:42.690\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n250\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.920\n>> So I've got my daisy flower and\n\n251\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.760\nI've got my symbol sprayer and\nI'm just gonna take it and\n\n252\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.590\njust, just click hold and drag.\n\n253\n00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.240\nI'm just gonna spray some flowers\naround and then I'm gonna let go.\n\n254\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.810\nAnd what does it do?\n\n255\n00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.805\nIt makes a symbol set, okay, up there.\n\n256\n00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:02.183\nAnd I can add to this existing symbol\nset maybe add a little bit more.\n\n257\n00:14:02.183 --> 00:14:06.250\nOkay cuz it's still selected, I'm using\nmy sprayer to go ahead and get in here.\n\n258\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.890\nAnd so here's what I've got.\n\n259\n00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.820\nI've got all of my sprayed flowers.\n\n260\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.235\nSo I'm just kinda getting it in there.\n\n261\n00:14:12.235 --> 00:14:13.380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As a simple set.\n\n262\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:20.890\nNow when you go through all of these\ndifferent modifiers of your symbol group.\n\n263\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.990\nThis is where it gets fun Symbol shifter.\n\n264\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.720\nWell, symbol shifter\nwill shift them around.\n\n265\n00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.130\nAnd you can see the little icons\nthat has like little arrows.\n\n266\n00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.860\nSo I can just kinda move this around,\nmaybe kinda push it.\n\n267\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.350\nIt's like a little pusher.\n\n268\n00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.080\n>> Almost like the morph tool or\nsomething in Photoshop.\n\n269\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.615\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n270\n00:14:39.615 --> 00:14:42.872\nOr the play dough tools\nas I would call them.\n\n271\n00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:43.750\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n272\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.560\nSo you can kinda move these around.\n\n273\n00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.040\nI can say alright there we go and make\na nice little, I don't know, backward-C.\n\n274\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.920\n[LAUGH] And\nthen I've got the symbol scruncher.\n\n275\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.056\nThat's it's real name, I'm not making that\nup, cuz I make a lot of my own words up,\n\n276\n00:14:57.056 --> 00:15:01.043\nbut that's not, symbol scruncher is where\nI just, [SOUND] scrunches together.\n\n277\n00:15:01.043 --> 00:15:01.751\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n278\n00:15:01.751 --> 00:15:03.170\n>> Pulls it together.\n\n279\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.615\n>> Now the opposite of that would\nbe push them further apart, right?\n\n280\n00:15:05.615 --> 00:15:07.000\n>> Uh-huh?\n>> A lot of these tools if you want\n\n281\n00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.490\nthe opposite of it,\nhold the Alt key, or the Option key.\n\n282\n00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.370\nAnd so\nyou can see it's like I'm holding it.\n\n283\n00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:16.600\nI'm pushing it away,\nbecause I'm holding that alt key or\n\n284\n00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:22.240\noption then I don't let, now I'm not\ndoing it and that's scrunching together.\n\n285\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.600\nThe symbol sizer,\nsame idea, click and hold.\n\n286\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.160\nI'm just clicking and\nholding and makes it bigger.\n\n287\n00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.650\nClick hold, oops, to much,\nOption or Alt, hold Option or\n\n288\n00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:37.870\nAlt and then it goes ahead and\nsizes it the other direction.\n\n289\n00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.450\nSo you can kind of,\njust some fun stuff there.\n\n290\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.705\nOkay, simple spinner I think you\nguys are getting the idea while I\n\n291\n00:15:44.705 --> 00:15:46.134\ncan just spin these around.\n\n292\n00:15:46.134 --> 00:15:49.640\nThese are pretty much the same all around,\nso\n\n293\n00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.621\nthe spinner on this one might not\nshow as much as a symbol that like\n\n294\n00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:59.526\nif we do with the banner or\nsomething, that would really show.\n\n295\n00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:00.955\nAnd then, keep on going down.\n\n296\n00:16:00.955 --> 00:16:02.931\nThis is the symbol stainer.\n\n297\n00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:07.702\nThis is where whatever color you choose\nin your film, and if you then click here,\n\n298\n00:16:07.702 --> 00:16:11.430\nyou see how it's going to\nactually start staining it?\n\n299\n00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.280\nYou can't stain white,\nbecause white is white, but\n\n300\n00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.420\nI can start changing the colors here, and\n\n301\n00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:23.120\nI can start making all sorts of pretty\ncolored flowers and Getting all very.\n\n302\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.940\n>> Very neat.\n\n303\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.930\n>> Very, very hippy.\n\n304\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:26.670\nHippy chick.\n\n305\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.850\nSo, stainer.\n\n306\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.170\nAnd then here over here\nwe have the screener.\n\n307\n00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.820\nScreening, when you do screens\nit's like transparency, opacity.\n\n308\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.500\nChanging the see-throughness, right.\n\n309\n00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.890\nAnd so I can make it more see-through.\n\n310\n00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.470\nHold the option if I've got too much,\nor alt to come back.\n\n311\n00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.090\nMake it come back up.\n\n312\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.650\nAnd then the last one is\nyour Symbol Stylizer.\n\n313\n00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.650\nSymbol Stylizer is going to be\nbased off your graphic styles.\n\n314\n00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.240\nOkay?\n\n315\n00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.630\nThat's not your graphic styles.\n\n316\n00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.450\nThere's your graphic styles.\n\n317\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.318\nSo if you had specific styles\nthat you wanted to apply,\n\n318\n00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:01.765\nthis one if you get a very\ncomplicated style, and\n\n319\n00:17:01.765 --> 00:17:06.390\nstart applying to it,\nit might tax out your graphics processor,\n\n320\n00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:11.206\nso as I say that I'm like okay are we\ngonna get stuck too much in here?\n\n321\n00:17:11.206 --> 00:17:14.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yep, see I'm already starting to Ooh!\n\n322\n00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.945\nAlright, and\nI don't know if that really works for\n\n323\n00:17:16.945 --> 00:17:19.580\nthis particular spring of the symbol\n>> Mm.\n\n324\n00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.900\n>> So I'm just gonna undo that.\n\n325\n00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:26.472\nBut at least you understand what\nthis last tool does is it applies\n\n326\n00:17:26.472 --> 00:17:31.422\nstyles to your symbol set and\nyou can just click, click,\n\n327\n00:17:31.422 --> 00:17:37.323\nclick over which ones you do, and\nthat makes your group kind of fun.\n\n328\n00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:41.896\nJust like our live paints and our live\ntraces, this is still a symbol set and\n\n329\n00:17:41.896 --> 00:17:44.360\nit we'll keep it as a symbol set.\n\n330\n00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:51.090\nIf I wanted to get into the individual\nparts of it to modify individual past,\n\n331\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.160\nthat's why you do have the option\nof expanding cuz expand for\n\n332\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.840\nanything just means expand it out to\nthe components that is created out of,\n\n333\n00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.810\ndon't keep it as the, for\nexample in this one, a simple set.\n\n334\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.960\nSo you go to the object menu and\nyou can expand this and then to\n\n335\n00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.509\nwhere do I want to expand, you click okay,\nand then now you can see that is a group.\n\n336\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.290\nAnd then when I get out of my groups,\nit's actually still my symbols.\n\n337\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.400\nSo it's keeping it as a symbol,\nit doesn't go all the way to its path, but\n\n338\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.020\nthat's where you could break the link to\nthe symbol, then that of course makes the,\n\n339\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:28.830\nit's not a symbol anymore,\nit's just its own path or vector object.\n\n340\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.610\nAnd then you can do things like that.\n\n341\n00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.390\nSo we've made all these fun symbols.\n\n342\n00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:33.150\nHere we've made our own.\n\n343\n00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.670\nWe've made our banner.\n\n344\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.000\nWe've modified some of the existing\nsymbols and made our own.\n\n345\n00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.290\nSo these are, symbols are file specific.\n\n346\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:46.740\nJust like we have with swatches and\nbrushes and graphic styles,\n\n347\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.730\nyou want to be able to use these symbols\nas a library in another new file,\n\n348\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.780\nwell then we go ahead and save the library\nand then open the new to the find\n\n349\n00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.250\nlibrary like we have in the past,\nso let's just walk through this.\n\n350\n00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.530\nIf this is something that you haven't\nwatched the other episodes that we did\n\n351\n00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:06.660\nthat in, so you can either go through\nthe four lines of triangle on the top,\n\n352\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.830\nor you can go through the library down at\nthe bottom of where, actually to say that.\n\n353\n00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.968\nSorry, my bad.\n\n354\n00:19:11.968 --> 00:19:12.583\nNo, it's right there.\n\n355\n00:19:12.583 --> 00:19:13.835\nOkay.\nIt is at the top.\n\n356\n00:19:13.835 --> 00:19:14.833\nYeah, save samples.\n\n357\n00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:19.760\n[LAUGH] Sorry, I was looking for\nit to be spelled out just like this.\n\n358\n00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.292\n>> Okay?\nSo\n\n359\n00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:22.184\nI'll go this way because this\nis actually the way I always go.\n\n360\n00:19:22.184 --> 00:19:26.311\n[LAUGH] So if I go to I want to save\nthese awesome symbols as its own library,\n\n361\n00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:31.051\nyou always wanna go into where it actually\nshows you where the symbols folder down in\n\n362\n00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:32.290\nyour applications.\n\n363\n00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.376\nI already made a fun1, so\nlet's go with fun2, okay.\n\n364\n00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:39.116\nLet's go with, oops, fun2.\n\n365\n00:19:39.116 --> 00:19:40.034\n>> They were a lot of fun.\n\n366\n00:19:40.034 --> 00:19:43.436\n>> They were a lot of fun and\nI used fun in another example.\n\n367\n00:19:43.436 --> 00:19:47.975\nSo let's go with save and\nnow I've got those symbols saved so\n\n368\n00:19:47.975 --> 00:19:51.713\nif I start a new file and\nI go okay and now I'm like,\n\n369\n00:19:51.713 --> 00:19:56.030\nall right well I want all\nthose fun symbols back in.\n\n370\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.980\nIf I go down here to\nthe bottom right hand corner,\n\n371\n00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.850\nbecause that's where I go to open\nlibraries, and go to User Defined.\n\n372\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.219\nThere they are, so I can say all\nright well let's bring up that fun2.\n\n373\n00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:09.800\nAnd then all of those symbols that I was\nusing in other files are now in its own\n\n374\n00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.900\nlibrary and I can move them and I can do\nwhatever I want with them as I did before.\n\n375\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.100\nSo there you go.\n\n376\n00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.220\n>> All right,\nfantastic look Vaughn at symbols and\n\n377\n00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.310\nhow we can use them with an Illustrator.\n\n378\n00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:25.540\nReally we're talking about taking a shape,\nmaking it into a symbol, and\n\n379\n00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.380\nnow when we use those symbols,\ntheir linked.\n\n380\n00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.520\nSo if I got 20 of those guys out in my\ndocument I can edit it in one place and\n\n381\n00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.100\nhave those changes propagate out to all\nthe different instances of those symbols\n\n382\n00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.650\nbut we can always break the link.\n\n383\n00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.680\nSo a lot of really good uses of those.\n\n384\n00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.370\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n385\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.850\nSigning off for ITPro.TV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n386\n00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:43.630\n>> And I'm Vaughn Smith.\n\n387\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.433\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n388\n00:20:45.433 --> 00:20:51.863\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] >> Yes,\n\n11\n00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.110\nand while it's a little bit of\na mouthful to say all that effects and\n\n12\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.420\ngraphics styles, they all do well\n>> They all work together.\n\n13\n00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.000\nAnd so there's, you can separate them out,\nbut they really build off of each other.\n\n14\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.390\nSo that's what we're\ngoing to talk about apply\n\n15\n00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.180\nthe effects\n>> Modifying it and getting them\n\n16\n00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.160\ninto a collection, so I have a handout\nready to go and our file started.\n\n17\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.750\nSo we have our little note so\nwe can follow along with and\n\n18\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.540\nI have those like action items, I guess\nyou could say as a said with each one.\n\n19\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.450\nThe effects is where you apply well,\neffects.\n\n20\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.180\nLike the filters,\nhow I can make things look different.\n\n21\n00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.170\nI want some glowing edges or I want to\ndo a drop shadow, things like that.\n\n22\n00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.750\nYou have layer effects and\nlayer filters in Photoshop.\n\n23\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.530\nThis would be like the Illustrator\nequivalent of that, so you apply.\n\n24\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.220\nThe appearance, that's a panel, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.570\nSo affects the menus.\n\n26\n00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.800\nAppearance is a panel and\nthat's where you modify.\n\n27\n00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.540\nSo that's where you can actually\nbring up the formatting.\n\n28\n00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.200\nAll of the appearance of any item okay?\n\n29\n00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.150\nSo it doesn't matter whether it has an\neffect or not you can still go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.180\nuse that panel to modify\nthe appearance of said object.\n\n31\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.570\n>> And a graphic style,\nit's just like styles in topography,\n\n32\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.340\nglobal swatches, it's all kind\nof connected, it's the same idea\n\n33\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.570\nthat you have a collection of\nformatting and appearance and effects.\n\n34\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.120\nThat you can use to quickly format other\nitems that look the exact same way.\n\n35\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.660\nSo and it does work like your brushes and\nyour symbols,\n\n36\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.940\nis that you do have libraries and you can\nhave a lot that are already created and\n\n37\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.470\nyou can\n>> Create your own and\n\n38\n00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.030\nthen modify and like such.\n\n39\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.360\nSo, I'd like to start with the appearance\n\n40\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.370\npanel because this is a place that\nyou can go to to format stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.630\nLike, for example, this star.\n\n42\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.400\nWe've been coming, I've been showing\nyou ways you can change the fill and\n\n43\n00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.150\nstrokes from up here.\n\n44\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.060\nYou can come over to the Strokes panel and\nyou can change that.\n\n45\n00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.010\nBut all of the appearance that\n\n46\n00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.050\ninhabits this object can be\nchanged from the Appearance panel.\n\n47\n00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.290\nSo I'm going to bring this up and\nmaybe I'll make it a little bit bigger so\n\n48\n00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.360\nyou can see it as well.\n\n49\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.590\nHere, let me make it down,\nso I have this selected and\n\n50\n00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.470\nthere's a stroke, fill,\nthe opacity of each one.\n\n51\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.460\nI can change it right from here.\n\n52\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.662\nYet, another way.\n\n53\n00:03:09.662 --> 00:03:10.174\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:03:10.174 --> 00:03:12.334\n>> That we can modify our items.\n\n55\n00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:13.114\nSo maybe I want\n\n56\n00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:18.140\nto change the stroke color, and\nI wanna change this fill color.\n\n57\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.130\nAnd that sounds like that's great.\n\n58\n00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.340\nYou can also change the opacity\nof each one of them.\n\n59\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.840\nAnd that's where before, like, up here\nthe opacity, that's for everybody, right?\n\n60\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.600\nWell on hear you can really\nstart breaking it down and\n\n61\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.140\ndo the different things you want.\n\n62\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.750\nAnd one of my favorite parts\nof the appearance panel.\n\n63\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.460\nIs sharing people how you can, you don't\nhave just one stroke or just one fill.\n\n64\n00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.150\nLike, there is more, right?\n\n65\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.860\nYou have other things that you can do.\n\n66\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.550\nYou can have multiple strokes.\n\n67\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.120\nYou can have multiple fills, and\n\n68\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.170\nthat's where you can start\nreally modifying the appearance.\n\n69\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.820\nAnd this is one of few places\nwhere I know how to apply that.\n\n70\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.170\nSo, Single stroke, single fill.\n\n71\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.780\nDown here,\nyou can see at the bottom corners,\n\n72\n00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.450\nyou can add a new stroke or\nadd a new fill.\n\n73\n00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.050\nSo I'm gonna go with the new stroke, and\n\n74\n00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.680\nif I click on this,\njust adds another stroke.\n\n75\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.810\nNow visually this doesn't\nmake any difference.\n\n76\n00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.700\nIt's like, okay, so I don't see anything.\n\n77\n00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.390\nThis is where your stacking order\nreally comes into play, because see,\n\n78\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.150\nthis one stroke is on top.\n\n79\n00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.190\nAnd this is the second\nstroke that's underneath it.\n\n80\n00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.140\nI'm gonna take the underneath one,\nthe second one, in here.\n\n81\n00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.810\nI'm gonna change the color then I'm\ngonna change the size of the stroke.\n\n82\n00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.840\nNow you can see that the stroke\nthat is underneath this purple.\n\n83\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.315\nNow you can really visually see the yellow\non the top the purples underneath it and\n\n84\n00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:52.205\nit's wider, so it's actually kind of\nshowing almost like a double stroke.\n\n85\n00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:55.540\nSo this is always the fun for me.\n\n86\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.485\n[LAUGH] I love this part.\n\n87\n00:04:56.485 --> 00:04:58.837\nSo I was like, really and\nthen you can add another stroke.\n\n88\n00:04:58.837 --> 00:05:01.077\nAnother stroke, and\njust change all different things.\n\n89\n00:05:01.077 --> 00:05:06.207\nAnd each one of these modifying features,\nlike the stroke that is\n\n90\n00:05:07.427 --> 00:05:11.817\norange and underlying, means you can\ngo into those properties even more.\n\n91\n00:05:11.817 --> 00:05:14.947\nSo I can change this stroke\nbecause it's going on either side,\n\n92\n00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:17.420\nbecause that's the default\nstroke alignment.\n\n93\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.570\nBut I can make it to go all the way,\nall the way out,\n\n94\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.190\nI could change the caps in the corner.\n\n95\n00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.660\nSo anything that you had that you can\nformat on a single item with one stroke,\n\n96\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.740\nyou can do the same thing here, so.\n\n97\n00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.330\nLots and lots of fun, you can make a dash.\n\n98\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.969\nI think I'm just going to go ahead and\nkeep it as a regular corner\n\n99\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.440\nI like the kind of tripling.\n\n100\n00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.180\nYeah, that's what it looks like to me.\n\n101\n00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.590\nSo I like that,\nI think I want to keep that, okay.\n\n102\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.260\nSo you just keep on adding now,\n\n103\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.490\nthat stacking order that you can\nchange In your layers panel.\n\n104\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.950\nOne on top of the other.\n\n105\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.810\nSame thing applies here\nwith the appearance.\n\n106\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.050\nIf I take the stroke and I pull this up.\n\n107\n00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.430\nYou see how there's that line.\n\n108\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.990\nSolid line.\n\n109\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.050\nNow the stroke's on top, so\nnow I can't even see the yellow one.\n\n110\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.510\nOkay, so just being aware of the,\nkind of, concept that stacking order\n\n111\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.260\ntakes on with any object, that applies\nright here in the appearance panel.\n\n112\n00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.580\nI'm gonna go ahead and put that back down.\n\n113\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.790\nTo go here, and that's how you can add it.\n\n114\n00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.700\nI can add another fill.\n\n115\n00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.610\nNow, right now this fill might\nnot make much sense, because,\n\n116\n00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.920\nespecially if I drag that down.\n\n117\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.690\nSee, I just dragged it down, sorry,\nI went a little fast on that one.\n\n118\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.075\nI can make this be like what is that,\nwhat color is that?\n\n119\n00:06:34.075 --> 00:06:34.722\nThat's green.\n\n120\n00:06:34.722 --> 00:06:35.475\n[LAUGH]\n>> Green.\n\n121\n00:06:35.475 --> 00:06:36.120\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n122\n00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.470\nI have a double green fill right here.\n\n123\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.250\nIt's not going to make much difference\nunless I change the stacking order there.\n\n124\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:51.430\nBut, let me show you even more of this\nwhole concept of the stacking and\n\n125\n00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.020\napplying and the appearance panel and\nhow much more fun stuff you can do.\n\n126\n00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.960\nSo I'm gonna move on to effects.\n\n127\n00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.110\nOkay, and come back around\nto the appearance, effects.\n\n128\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.900\nThis is where I want to add a drop shadow,\nI want to add a scribble.\n\n129\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.170\nI can do all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n130\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.100\nHave the item I want\nto apply my effect to.\n\n131\n00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.340\nI go into my effect menu.\n\n132\n00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.200\nYou see there's different versions,\n\n133\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.890\nthere's the Illustrator effects,\nand the Photoshop effects.\n\n134\n00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.660\nAnd I believe I actually pulled\nthis out in the images episode,\n\n135\n00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.660\nwhere we did apply Photoshop like affects,\n\n136\n00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.700\nsort of like the filters in Photoshop,\nthey're very similar to it.\n\n137\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.470\nYou might see these particular\neffects in Illustrator\n\n138\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.860\nbe demonstrated more in images.\n\n139\n00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.030\nI'm actually using the glowing edges.\n\n140\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:46.270\nBut, you can still apply the blur and\nthe glowing edges to a vector item.\n\n141\n00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.681\nYou just might not always see the results\nas clearly as it is in an image.\n\n142\n00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:52.810\nIt depends on the Effect\nthat you're picking.\n\n143\n00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.576\nSo, but I'm gonna keep up in\nthe Illustrator effects and\n\n144\n00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:59.330\nI'm gonna go into the stylized section.\n\n145\n00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.385\nAnd I'm gonna go to scribble because it\nreally shows what I want to show you.\n\n146\n00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:06.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It shows what I want to show you.\n\n147\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.800\nI'm gonna go to scribble and I have all\nof these different scribble item or\n\n148\n00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.820\nscribble options.\n\n149\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.920\nI have it on preview.\n\n150\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.738\nAnd I'm just gonna keep it is whatever it\nhas by default for now just cuz you could\n\n151\n00:08:18.738 --> 00:08:22.843\nhave a lot of fun pulling these levels\nleft and right and see what it could do.\n\n152\n00:08:22.843 --> 00:08:24.714\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Click okay,\n\n153\n00:08:24.714 --> 00:08:28.785\nit is applying this\nscribble to everything.\n\n154\n00:08:28.785 --> 00:08:32.167\nThe yellow stroke, the purple stroke,\nand the two fills,\n\n155\n00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:34.745\nnow this is where it gets a little odd,\nokay?\n\n156\n00:08:34.745 --> 00:08:37.140\nBecause remember it's all about stacking.\n\n157\n00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.230\n>> All right\n>> But look where the scribble is\n\n158\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.400\n>> Looks like it's at the bottom.\n\n159\n00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.370\n>> It is, it's at the bottom,\nwait a second but\n\n160\n00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.200\nit shouldn't be on top because it then\nit affects everything down below it.\n\n161\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.180\nWell, when you talk about effects,\nknow that the effects go at the bottom.\n\n162\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.470\nSame way like with right here.\n\n163\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.240\nSee the opacity right there?\n\n164\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.600\nIf I change this and drag that down,\nit's changing the opacity of everything.\n\n165\n00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.410\nOkay.\n>> So, it's just the opposite.\n\n166\n00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:05.510\nThen your effects have to go underneath\nthe layers that you want it to affect.\n\n167\n00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.240\n>> Yes.\n\n168\n00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.270\n>> Exactly, it is backwards.\n\n169\n00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:07.940\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n171\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.720\n>> It's very backwards,\n\n172\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.390\nbut that's just how it works, okay.\n\n173\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.760\nAnd right here, this scribble,\nit's not associated with one\n\n174\n00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.970\nsingle piece of either the stroke or\nthe fills, all of them, but\n\n175\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:29.340\nthat's where you could group it into\none of those, you see where I'm going?\n\n176\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.030\nYeah, do the stroke or the fill, so if I\ntook the scribble and went up to here,\n\n177\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.540\nsee, there's a line that I'm\nstill underneath the stroke.\n\n178\n00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.820\nOkay, but\nit's in that group if you wanna say.\n\n179\n00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.600\nAnd so now the scribbles only\nchanging that one stroke.\n\n180\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.170\nIt's not changing the other ones,\nit's not changing the fill.\n\n181\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.630\nOkay, so if I took this and went to,\nhere let me expand this out first, okay.\n\n182\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.480\nIf I took the scribble to the just this,\n\n183\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.960\nsee now you can actually start\nseeing the pink underneath.\n\n184\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.190\nAnd the other thing of,\nif I have an effect that's on an item,\n\n185\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.760\nwhether that's for the whole thing or\nparts of like, fill or\n\n186\n00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.960\nstroke, you can then modify that effect,\nor edit it,\n\n187\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.410\nby clicking it in the appearance panel,\nyou don't go back up to the effects menu,\n\n188\n00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:22.340\nand then I can change the variation,\nI think it was the width.\n\n189\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.200\nThat's why I wanted to pull down\na little bit, see, it could see and\n\n190\n00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.030\nthen the spacing, I can make it looser.\n\n191\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.400\nSo you can see, there you go.\n\n192\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.340\nI only have the scribble\non just the green fill.\n\n193\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.760\nNot any of the other things but\n\n194\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.350\nif I pull it on back down, my panels\ngetting a little smaller, there we go.\n\n195\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.830\nI can pull it down to everybody, come on!\n\n196\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.510\nWhoops. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\n>> Pull it on down and\n\n197\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.350\nnow I can, that's a little weird.\n\n198\n00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.645\nSo you can do that.\n\n199\n00:10:47.645 --> 00:10:49.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's just fun.\n\n200\n00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.410\nI love this stuff.\n\n201\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.280\nYou can do so\nmany different variations on it.\n\n202\n00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.740\nAnd if I wanted to specifically\ntarget one entity of this.\n\n203\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.540\nOne part of it.\n\n204\n00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.310\nIf I really only wanted to change\nwhat the yellow stroke is doing.\n\n205\n00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.370\nNotice how I've highlighted, or selected,\n\n206\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:11.570\nthat particular element of this\nobject in the Appearance panel and\n\n207\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.720\nthen went to Effect, and\nI'll do the same scribbling and\n\n208\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.630\nmaybe just change the variation, the\nspacing to go a little bit differently.\n\n209\n00:11:21.784 --> 00:11:26.770\nSo you could see there it's\ngonna automatically go into only\n\n210\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:31.840\naffecting the yellow stroke, not the whole\nthing because I had isolated that\n\n211\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.930\none part of this element\nthat I wanted to go with.\n\n212\n00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.610\n>> Very cool.\n\n213\n00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:43.320\n>> Yeah, so you can see that that's\nwhere you can start adding effects\n\n214\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:50.630\nto different parts, moving it around,\nand then you can go crazy, all right?\n\n215\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.610\nSo all of these effects, sorry, all of\nthis appearance that I have on this item,\n\n216\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:02.520\nI want to be able to apply this\nsame stuff quickly to here.\n\n217\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.940\nAnd that was a lot of stuff that we did,\nright?\n\n218\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.450\n>> There was.\n>> We did a lot of modifications,\n\n219\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.480\nand I just don't wanna have to redo that,\nokay.\n\n220\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.310\nYou make it graphic style, okay.\n\n221\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.470\nJust like we made textiles.\n\n222\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.540\nSo we have graphic styles.\n\n223\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.840\nHere we go, here's my panel.\n\n224\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.300\nI think you've seen the other episodes.\n\n225\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.610\nYou know where we're going.\n\n226\n00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.580\n>> I'm thinking you're gonna\ndrag that into the panel.\n\n227\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.105\n>> Exactly.\n\n228\n00:12:26.105 --> 00:12:27.570\n[LAUGH] So I'll take it.\n\n229\n00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.310\nI'll take all.\n\n230\n00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.420\nAnd this is just,\nit's not gonna take the star.\n\n231\n00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.440\nIt's not seeing it as a star.\n\n232\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.520\nIt's seeing it as whatever\nis in this appearance panel.\n\n233\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.560\nOkay, so you can see that it came in,\nno star, right, it's just the fills and\n\n234\n00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.830\nthe strokes and the effects,\neverything in here.\n\n235\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.760\nSo then if I wanted to take these guys,\nI'm just gonna shift+click and\n\n236\n00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.860\nselect all of these,\nand then there you go.\n\n237\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:57.100\nEven this guy, I can go ahead and\nquickly apply formats\n\n238\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.110\nfrom the Appearance panel to\nmultiple objects, and it's a lot\n\n239\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.230\nquicker than having to like remember all\nthe settings and everything like that.\n\n240\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.720\nNow with the Options, just to let\nyou know, I double-clicked on it.\n\n241\n00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.050\nSorry, I went a little faster.\n\n242\n00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.220\nI was double-clicking it because in the\nbrushes, you can go in double-clicking or\n\n243\n00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.260\nthe symbols.\n\n244\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.910\nYou could double click into\nthe source of it changes all of it.\n\n245\n00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.630\nIt doesn't really work that\nway in graphic styles.\n\n246\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.400\nYou can't modify the source of the style.\n\n247\n00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.407\nWhat you could do is take one that\nhas the style applied to it and\n\n248\n00:13:31.407 --> 00:13:33.334\nthen do some modifications,\n\n249\n00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:38.037\nlike okay, maybe I'll change this\ncolor here to, that's not really,\n\n250\n00:13:38.037 --> 00:13:42.767\nlet me make that, sorry I'm trying\nto make something more pronounced.\n\n251\n00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:43.970\nThere, we'll go with the fill color.\n\n252\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.400\nAll right, we'll change that to yellow.\n\n253\n00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.940\nSo you just modify and then just\ndrag this into the graphic styles.\n\n254\n00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.250\nAnd then, make a new style.\n\n255\n00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:56.650\nSo you don't really go to\nthe Source of the style,\n\n256\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.430\nso it doesn't kind of exist that way.\n\n257\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:02.458\nThe only thing is just give it a name\ncuz I just drag it, I'm naming anything.\n\n258\n00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:04.258\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n259\n00:14:04.258 --> 00:14:05.450\n>> Okay so\n\n260\n00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.870\nwe covered appearance panel,\nawesome, how to make our strokes.\n\n261\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:15.460\nHow to do our graphic styles,\nwe created our own but we have libraries.\n\n262\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.940\nLibraries are awesome because\nit's a bunch of premade crayons,\n\n263\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.965\nas I keep calling it right.\n\n264\n00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:23.729\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is where more fun illustrator\n\n265\n00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.560\nthings are located.\n\n266\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.460\nAnd so I can go into\ndifferent types of libraries.\n\n267\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.360\nI can go into a type effect.\n\n268\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.390\nI could go into,\nif I'm going through my different,\n\n269\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.888\nthose are some interesting patterns,\nright.\n\n270\n00:14:37.888 --> 00:14:38.844\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n271\n00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.430\n>> And you could just start clicking\n\n272\n00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:45.150\nthrough your different libraries of all of\nthose appearances that you want to apply.\n\n273\n00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.410\nSo maybe I'll take,\nthere is a whole scribble, right.\n\n274\n00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.000\n>> Wow.\n\n275\n00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.210\n>> So I can go into here,\nmaybe apply that one or that one.\n\n276\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.850\nTake our text ones okay.\n\n277\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.960\nI'm starting to get into that,\n\n278\n00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.390\nI'm just like, click and run-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n279\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.790\n>> And gone crazy, so\n\n280\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.620\nyou can see it appear like\nthat's a little strange.\n\n281\n00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.600\nBut now how did it do that,\nlike it's going up and this\n\n282\n00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.990\none's modifying and there's some that, all\nright, you actually have some 3D effects.\n\n283\n00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.830\nSo, if I took this star.\n\n284\n00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.790\nSee, it's actually kind\nof coming out at us,\n\n285\n00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.192\nand this one will probably,\nI don't want this one.\n\n286\n00:15:23.192 --> 00:15:23.704\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:15:23.704 --> 00:15:24.720\n>> But, you have\n\n288\n00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.630\na different way where it's\nactually looking like a 3D item.\n\n289\n00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.195\nI got a lot of stuff going on here,\ndon't I?\n\n290\n00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.283\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n291\n00:15:31.283 --> 00:15:33.570\n>> So, how are they doing that?\n\n292\n00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.920\nOkay, well,\nit's all back into our appearance, right?\n\n293\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.900\nIt's showing us that it\nhas multiple strokes, and\n\n294\n00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.990\nhas something known as\nyour 3D Extrude & Bevel.\n\n295\n00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:48.470\nSo I wanted to point that one\nout specifically because I think\n\n296\n00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.215\nit's a lot of fun.\n\n297\n00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:50.260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n298\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.173\n>> Everything is fun in Illustrator.\n\n299\n00:15:51.173 --> 00:15:54.669\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if I take my square and\n\n300\n00:15:54.669 --> 00:15:58.510\nbefore I go there let me\njust do one other thing.\n\n301\n00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.361\nI don't want this appearance any more.\n\n302\n00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:05.950\nI just don't want any of this style,\nall these multiple fills and strobes.\n\n303\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.450\nYou see, if I have the item selected in\nthe Appearance panel, you can just Remove.\n\n304\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.880\nYou can just clear it.\n\n305\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.290\nIf you clear it,\nyou take everything off the table.\n\n306\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.291\nI can just clear it.\n\n307\n00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:20.210\nI backed it as just a straight\npath with no fill, no strokes.\n\n308\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.490\nIt's kinda like a clean slate,\nokay, all right,\n\n309\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:31.040\ncuz I wanted to start over to show you\nthe 3D extreme double effect, okay.\n\n310\n00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.896\nSo I got the atom selected.\n\n311\n00:16:31.896 --> 00:16:34.356\nAnd I go to the Effects menu, and\n\n312\n00:16:34.356 --> 00:16:40.150\nthe reason that's not working is\nbecause I need to click there, sorry.\n\n313\n00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:46.432\nWhat happened is I had the fill selected,\nand basically it wasn't working.\n\n314\n00:16:46.432 --> 00:16:51.110\nSo [LAUGH] I had to kind of go back\nup to where I had the whole path\n\n315\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.720\ncuz that's what I want to apply it to.\n\n316\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.770\nSo that's always just try to\ndouble-check and troubleshoot, okay.\n\n317\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.720\n>> Select to effect, right?\n\n318\n00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.020\n>> Yeah, select to effect.\n\n319\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.858\nAll right, so I've got my square selected,\nI've got the Effects menu up and\n\n320\n00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.726\nI have 3D Extrude and Bevel.\n\n321\n00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:11.847\nAnd it brings up the 3D Extrude and\nBevel dialogue box, and\n\n322\n00:17:11.847 --> 00:17:14.330\nI'm going to bring this over here.\n\n323\n00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:19.250\nAnd I'm going to turn on your preview so\nyou can see it, okay.\n\n324\n00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.836\nYou have the Extruded Depth,\n\n325\n00:17:21.836 --> 00:17:28.280\nhow far back do I want to make this cube,\nthis 3D part of the square.\n\n326\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.871\nSo if I extend this, see, ooh,\nI'm actually making a cube, right.\n\n327\n00:17:33.871 --> 00:17:35.054\nOoh, that's fun.\n\n328\n00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:40.035\nAll right, and I can go through and\nchange the caps.\n\n329\n00:17:40.035 --> 00:17:41.915\nYou see how it's see-through?\n\n330\n00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:45.215\nI have a cap versus no cap,\nso it can go through it.\n\n331\n00:17:45.215 --> 00:17:46.535\nKeep that cap on.\n\n332\n00:17:46.535 --> 00:17:51.695\nHow do you want it to bevel, the different\nkind of contourings on the sides?\n\n333\n00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:53.025\nAnd it's really just start\nplaying around,right,\n\n334\n00:17:53.025 --> 00:17:55.670\njust change the different features.\n\n335\n00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:56.817\nI'm going to have none on this.\n\n336\n00:17:56.817 --> 00:18:00.627\nAnd it's oriented in this manner but\nthis guy right here,\n\n337\n00:18:00.627 --> 00:18:04.550\nthis is where you're gonna\nstart moving it around, okay.\n\n338\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.660\nNow you can change\nthe different angles and\n\n339\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.495\nthe perspective in the dialogue boxes but\nI like to just kind of move it around.\n\n340\n00:18:11.495 --> 00:18:13.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so I take this and\n\n341\n00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.372\nyou see how you hover,\nyou get different icons of\n\n342\n00:18:18.372 --> 00:18:23.367\nbeing able to rotate it this way,\nrotate it this way,\n\n343\n00:18:23.367 --> 00:18:27.824\nokay, rotate there,\nflip it around this way.\n\n344\n00:18:27.824 --> 00:18:32.507\nSo there's all sorts of ways that\nyou could go ahead and manuever and\n\n345\n00:18:32.507 --> 00:18:36.944\nrotate this cube and this 3D effect\nthat you have going on here,\n\n346\n00:18:36.944 --> 00:18:41.570\ncuz I want to kind of keep it like that,\nand that looks pretty good.\n\n347\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.290\nSo I'm trying to move it around,\nI realize that I'm in a dialogue box and\n\n348\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.465\nit's not letting me do that.\n\n349\n00:18:45.465 --> 00:18:48.870\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nwe've got that in your shading.\n\n350\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.440\nThe other thing I wanted to\nshow you is the map artwork.\n\n351\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.344\nLike blocks, like building blocks,\nhas the A and the B.\n\n352\n00:18:57.344 --> 00:19:00.865\n>> Letters on the different sides,\nright, where a dice has numbers.\n\n353\n00:19:00.865 --> 00:19:05.640\n>> Mm-hm, exactly, this is the place where\nyou could actually do this by mapping\n\n354\n00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.780\nthe artwork on the different sides,\nand I have that preview still on.\n\n355\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.890\nI'm starting to run out of\nroom a little bit, okay.\n\n356\n00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.590\nYou have the surfaces, and I probably\nshould not have had this as orange,\n\n357\n00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.440\nthis is the wrong color.\n\n358\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.585\nBut there's a red box that's\nmoving around that is showing me\n\n359\n00:19:24.585 --> 00:19:30.969\non my screen which side of this\nsix-sided cube that's actually\n\n360\n00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:36.422\nletting me then add something\nto that surface, okay.\n\n361\n00:19:36.422 --> 00:19:38.930\nSo I'm gonna pick this one of six.\n\n362\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.440\nAnd again,\nthe red outlining will show you,\n\n363\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.980\nnot sure if you're\nseeing it on the orange.\n\n364\n00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.400\nIt's connected to symbols.\n\n365\n00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.752\nSo going back to our symbols episode,\nif you wanted specific things to\n\n366\n00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:55.619\nmap on those different sides of this cube\nor this 3D artwork, you would have to\n\n367\n00:19:55.619 --> 00:19:59.930\ncreate is a symbol first before you\nwent into the map artwork, okay.\n\n368\n00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.710\nNow, I have some in here.\n\n369\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.355\nRemember the flowers that we\nhad from our symbols episode.\n\n370\n00:20:04.355 --> 00:20:09.540\nI went ahead and added these cuz I\nwanted to make a cube of flowers.\n\n371\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.990\nSo if I choose the symbol, okay, and since\nI got the preview on I could go ahead and\n\n372\n00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.270\nchange the size, I can move it around.\n\n373\n00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.150\nThe other neat thing is you can go ahead\nand do Scale to Fit and it just scales\n\n374\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.470\nthe symbol to the size of that\nsurface of those 3D objects.\n\n375\n00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.010\n>> Handy.\n\n376\n00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.940\n>> It is, so then I kind of move around.\n\n377\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.680\nLet me go over to that one.\n\n378\n00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.260\nI know that's the left-hand side, and\nthen I go ahead and add another one and\n\n379\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.290\nscale to fit, okay.\n\n380\n00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:40.620\nAnd then we can go to that one at the top,\nand then I could go with the,\n\n381\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.540\nwhich one do we have?\n\n382\n00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.230\nThere we go.\n\n383\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:47.396\nAnd scale and so\nyou're actually creating a 3D surface with\n\n384\n00:20:47.396 --> 00:20:52.990\nmapped artwork to the perspective\nthat it has in that 3D-ness.\n\n385\n00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.899\n[LAUGH] I love this part too,\nthis invisible geometry.\n\n386\n00:20:56.899 --> 00:20:59.128\nIt's like don't even show\nme the box around it.\n\n387\n00:20:59.128 --> 00:20:59.884\n>> Wow.\n\n388\n00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:04.264\n>> Yeah, so you can do some really neat\n\n389\n00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:09.374\nthings using 3D with this map artwork and\n\n390\n00:21:09.374 --> 00:21:14.365\nthis 3D effect, and it's just great.\n\n391\n00:21:14.365 --> 00:21:17.860\nSo I'm gonna take that off and\nI'm gonna click OK,\n\n392\n00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:23.572\nclick OK again from mapping my artwork,\nand look at that, a nice 3D looking cube.\n\n393\n00:21:23.572 --> 00:21:25.980\nI just think it's a lot of fun.\n\n394\n00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.160\n>> That is very cool.\n\n395\n00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:32.080\n>> So 3D extrude and\nbevel is just one of the effects you can\n\n396\n00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.326\napply to any of your vector shapes or\nreally, your images.\n\n397\n00:21:37.326 --> 00:21:40.926\nNow, I wouldn't necessarily do 3D\nextrude and bevel on an image.\n\n398\n00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:43.571\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz that would look a little strange,\n\n399\n00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:47.340\nbut it's really about just getting in,\nand figuring it out and playing.\n\n400\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.960\nBecause we didn't go\nthrough all the effects.\n\n401\n00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.430\nThere's a bunch of them in here, okay.\n\n402\n00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.220\nI'm not gonna show you every single\none of them because that would take\n\n403\n00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.840\nforever, okay.\n\n404\n00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.880\nI do like drop shadows, so I will tell you\nwhat a drop shadow is because I'm always\n\n405\n00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.780\nlooking for a drop shadow.\n\n406\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.820\nThat's in the stylized effect, but\n\n407\n00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.495\nagain, knowing the concept of\nwhere this is coming from,\n\n408\n00:22:07.495 --> 00:22:11.220\nwhat's an effect,\nwhere does it go in the Appearance panel.\n\n409\n00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.330\nWhat does the Appearance panel let me do?\n\n410\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.020\nHow can I modify things?\n\n411\n00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.955\nHow can I then take the appearances and\n\n412\n00:22:16.955 --> 00:22:19.387\nmake it into a style where\nthe style is library?\n\n413\n00:22:19.387 --> 00:22:22.380\nIt all kind of, it does blend together.\n\n414\n00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.750\nLike I was saying in the beginning is that\nthere's separate places in Illustrator,\n\n415\n00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.860\nbut they all work together.\n\n416\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.310\nSo just get into those effects, just start\nclicking on stuff, just modify it in\n\n417\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:40.270\nthe Appearance panel and you can just go\ncrazy with them and it's lots of fun.\n\n418\n00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.200\n>> Fantastic.\n\n419\n00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.020\nLove it, Vonne, great look at\nthe way we can apply effects.\n\n420\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.540\nWe can modify the appearance and\nwe can create those graphic styles and\n\n421\n00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.790\napply them to our objects\nwithin our Illustrator project.\n\n422\n00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.900\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n423\n00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.750\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n424\n00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.220\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n425\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.974\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n426\n00:22:58.974 --> 00:23:08.200\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.430\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.680\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\n\n5\n00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.310\nperspective grid,\nwhich is a grid that gives us perspective.\n\n6\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.320\nOkay, there's a little bit more to it than\nthat and thankfully, Miss Vaughn is here\n\n7\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.030\nto help us understand what its\ngonna do and what it can do for us.\n\n8\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.860\nSo how you doing Vaughn?\n\n9\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.620\n>> Great.\n\n10\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.270\nI hope to explain it a little\nbit better that that.\n\n11\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.420\nBut honestly you're not that far off.\n\n12\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.990\n>> Alright.\n\n13\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.525\n>> It is a grid that gives us perspective.\n\n14\n00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:46.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that we draw on the grid.\n\n15\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.200\n>> And wrap.\n\n16\n00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.330\nThat's the show.\n\n17\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.030\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n18\n00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.001\nEnd scene.\n\n19\n00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.160\n[LAUGH] No we have a little bit more for\nyou there.\n\n20\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.300\nI'll give you a few more details on\nhow to actually work the prospective\n\n21\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.129\ngrade tool and\nthe perspective selection tool,\n\n22\n00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.030\nwhy, how and\nall the wonderful nuances about it.\n\n23\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.100\n>> And tell me again,\n\n24\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.680\nperspective, what do we mean by\nperspective when working with this stuff?\n\n25\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.950\n>> Exactly.\nSo, so\n\n26\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.250\nfar we've been creating things on a flat\nsurface, like anything that's just there.\n\n27\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.024\nThat's a [CROSSTALK] descriptions right?\n\n28\n00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:20.091\n>> More like your typical newspaper or\na flat brochure or something.\n\n29\n00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:21.278\n>> Correct.\n>> Not a lot of depth to it.\n\n30\n00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:24.980\n>> Yes, and what you get with\na perspective is, there's something called\n\n31\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.048\na vanishing point to where you can see\nsomething off in the distance and it's not\n\n32\n00:01:29.048 --> 00:01:32.890\njust where it's flat and straight,\nyou actually see the perspective.\n\n33\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.151\nIt's 3D, it's a 3D depth perception,\nif you want to say.\n\n34\n00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.200\n>> I always think of the railroad tracks,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.760\nIf you're standing on railroad tracks and\nyou're looking down.\n\n36\n00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.199\nIt's not two lines that runs\non forever and ever, right?\n\n37\n00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:46.720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They kinda go together way out there\n\n38\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.795\nin the distance.\n\n39\n00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.890\n>> Mm-hm, they start like this,\nand they come to a point and\n\n40\n00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.520\nthat's what they called the vanishing\npoint in 3D perspective.\n\n41\n00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.600\nSo you can create what looks like\n3D-ness with certain shading.\n\n42\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.260\nYou could take a circle, and\nif you use gradients the right way,\n\n43\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.930\nyou can make it look\nlike an actual sphere.\n\n44\n00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.510\nLike there is actual body to it,\nit's not just a flat surface.\n\n45\n00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.560\nYou can do that with just regular shapes,\nand coloring with gradients, and\n\n46\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.250\nso on and so forth.\n\n47\n00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.340\nBut this particular tool is where\nyou actually have a grid that is in\n\n48\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.940\na perspective and then you add things on\nto it and it keeps it in that perspective.\n\n49\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.510\n>> Yeah, it's pretty cool, so.\n\n50\n00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.020\nCuz we had done some 3D effects when\nwe were in the effects section, and we\n\n51\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.140\ndid some mapping where we put some artwork\non a cube, put some flowers on there.\n\n52\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.920\nSo it can be similar to that,\nbut again, it's similar yet\n\n53\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.101\ndifferent, my favorite saying.\n\n54\n00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:46.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's a completely\n\n55\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.740\ndifferent tool.\n\n56\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.300\nSo let's go ahead and go into my\nlittle notes section of this document.\n\n57\n00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.290\nI just wanted to throw\nsome things in there.\n\n58\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.000\nWhich it says,\n\n59\n00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.070\nwell you have two main tools in your tool\npanel that you're going to be using.\n\n60\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.370\nYou're going to use\nthe perspective grid tool,\n\n61\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.090\nwhere it actually just puts it on there.\n\n62\n00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.770\nAnd once you choose\na perspective grid tool.\n\n63\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.430\nThat's going to be a mouthful\nthroughout this episode.\n\n64\n00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.773\n>> It is.\n>> I can already feel it.\n\n65\n00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.261\n>> PGT can we just call it that?\n\n66\n00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:13.601\n>> We can do the PGT, okay.\n\n67\n00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.614\nI'll probably mess that one up too.\n\n68\n00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:18.685\n[LAUGH] So once you get the PGT tool,\nit makes the grid.\n\n69\n00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:20.660\nLike you don't have any like backtrack.\n\n70\n00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.800\nThere's no undo, and that's something\nthat would always throw me off.\n\n71\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.150\nCan I make that go away?\n\n72\n00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.920\nYou can hide it and not adhere to the\ngrid, but you can't really undo adding it.\n\n73\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.700\nIt's kind of strange, but\nagain, hide it, don't use it,\n\n74\n00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.050\nit's like it was never there anyways.\n\n75\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.770\nAnd then making sure that once you start\nadding things onto your perspective grid,\n\n76\n00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.690\nyou have to make sure you use\nthe perspective selection tool,\n\n77\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.560\nthe PS tool [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n78\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.820\n>> Because that's where if you don't use\n\n79\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.080\nthat PS tool and you use the regular\nselection tool, which I've kind of\n\n80\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.640\ndrilled into your brains like\nalways go back to that black arrow.\n\n81\n00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.330\nIt's where you have to\ngo back to the black.\n\n82\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.690\nWell, that's where you actually\nneed to go to the perspective\n\n83\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.450\nselection tool to make sure you're\nkeeping that because if you don't,\n\n84\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.980\nit goes somewhere different\nwe're demonstrating.\n\n85\n00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.230\nThe other main points.\n\n86\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.690\nYou go to the View menu because that's\nwhere you can show and hide and\n\n87\n00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.780\nchange your presets for the actual\ngrids that are on your document.\n\n88\n00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.670\nAnd then there's something, there's this\nlittle box at the top once you start\n\n89\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.050\ngetting into the perspective grid\nof which grid you want to be on or\n\n90\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.810\nhave active when you add items to it.\n\n91\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.140\nSo that's something that\nyou need to be aware of and\n\n92\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.330\nunderstand that when you're editing or\nmoving from within the grid using\n\n93\n00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.180\nthe perspective grid tool, and how you can\nuse your hot keys to flip back and forth.\n\n94\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.480\nAnd you can always drag\nitems that you've created\n\n95\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.830\noff the grid to pull them into the grid\nto make them come into perspective.\n\n96\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.250\nAnd you cannot add images, or raster\nimages directly to a perspective grid.\n\n97\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.020\nNot like you can with text, like I'll\nshow you, but there's a little trick and\n\n98\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.190\nthat's why it put it over here in\nthe little nodes of where If you do this\n\n99\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.010\nlittle trick you can make it happen.\n\n100\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.587\nSo give you that little tidbit for you.\n\n101\n00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:13.100\n>> I'm excited.\n\n102\n00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.740\n>> And\nI made a little example to start off with.\n\n103\n00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.450\nIt's super, super basic.\n\n104\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.550\nBut it's like a building if\nyou're standing on the corner and\n\n105\n00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.110\nlooking across the street, and you can\nactually see the streets going off.\n\n106\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.180\nHow can I recreate that?\n\n107\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.165\nYou could make this happen but it's a lot\neasier if you could keep that grid on it.\n\n108\n00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.640\nOkay, so that's what you've got.\n\n109\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.430\nNow, you don't see a grid,\n\n110\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.880\nyou don't see anything because\nI've like hid-ed it [LAUGH].\n\n111\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.970\nI've made it hide.\n\n112\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.370\n>> Hidden?\n>> It is hidden.\n\n113\n00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.340\nOkay, so if I go to the View menu and\nthe Perspective Grid, you can see\n\n114\n00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.930\nthat it says Show Grid right now because\nit's in hide form, and there you go.\n\n115\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.010\nYou can see that I've got a left plane,\n\n116\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.400\nI've got a right plane, and\nI've got a bottom plane.\n\n117\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.810\nAnd those are indicated by those different\ncolors, the blue, the orange, and\n\n118\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.030\nthe green grids.\n\n119\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.540\nAnd so it's falling along that grid.\n\n120\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.850\nThat little indicator of\nwhich grid do you see.\n\n121\n00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.520\nThat's that little guy up here,\nthe little control box.\n\n122\n00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.120\nAnd which side is on is what would be\nactive when you would add items to it.\n\n123\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.920\nOkay, so\nthis is one that's already created, and\n\n124\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.690\nwe'll come back to this example\nwhen I wanna use the image example.\n\n125\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.510\nBut I figured we just start new so\n\n126\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.900\nyou can see it from the beginning\nof where we're going.\n\n127\n00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.590\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo a File > New..\n\n128\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.540\nI'm just gonna keep all the defaults\nthat I have, which is just the, actually\n\n129\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.270\nI probably shouldn't keep that default cuz\nI was playing around with something else.\n\n130\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.275\nSo I'll go ahead and make a single\nart board with the letter size.\n\n131\n00:06:43.275 --> 00:06:45.280\nThat's fine.\nWe don't have to worry about anything for\n\n132\n00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.140\nthat, because we're just demonstrating and\nkind of playing around.\n\n133\n00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.790\nOkay.\n\n134\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.100\nSo, these tools over here in your toolbox,\nokay.\n\n135\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.060\nYou can see, as soon as I clicked on it,\nit went boom.\n\n136\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.910\nIt just threw a grid on there, I didn't\neven have to draw it or create it.\n\n137\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.840\nIt's just like there you go, you've got\nthe perspective grid tool selected.\n\n138\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.790\nI'm going to put a grid on there and\nnotice if I try, there is no undo,\n\n139\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.440\nI can't go back.\n\n140\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.780\nIt just added it, okay.\n\n141\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.120\nSo the only thing you can do is hide it.\n\n142\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.410\nAnd each one of these little handles.\n\n143\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.290\nNow I don't wanna go through\nevery single part of it really.\n\n144\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.910\nIf you start dragging it and\n\n145\n00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.640\nmoving it, that's the best way\nto figure out how it works.\n\n146\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.820\nBut you do have these guys back\nhere that the vanishing points and\n\n147\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.450\nthe horizon line of where they meet.\n\n148\n00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.150\nAnd you could start moving to where, if I\nwanted to like change the angle of where\n\n149\n00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.160\nI'm seeing the street corner,\nor extend the angle, or\n\n150\n00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.255\nI want to increase the size of,\nI'm still using that building example.\n\n151\n00:07:38.255 --> 00:07:39.630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You wanna increase\n\n152\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.000\nthe height of the building.\n\n153\n00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.561\nOr maybe I want to,\nI always call it swing the gate.\n\n154\n00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:48.684\nI wanna swing the gate open, because\nmaybe you're not doing a street view,\n\n155\n00:07:48.684 --> 00:07:51.971\nyou're doing a completely\ndifferent type of perspective,\n\n156\n00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:56.562\nwhere one's going this way, it's not, like\nmeeting at a corner if you want to say.\n\n157\n00:07:56.562 --> 00:07:59.187\n>> Or I've seen some building, if you\nwant to stick with the building thing,\n\n158\n00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.978\nthat have a, if you're standing on\nthe corner, they've got a flat front, but\n\n159\n00:08:01.978 --> 00:08:02.980\nthen the sides go back.\n\n160\n00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.570\n>> Exactly.\n>> Yeah because the doorway's on\n\n161\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.700\nthe corner there.\n\n162\n00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.272\n>> That's a great example.\n\n163\n00:08:07.272 --> 00:08:07.784\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:09.604\n>> Yeah, so you can just keep on dragging\n\n165\n00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:13.620\nthis because it all depends, it's kind of\nhard to conceptualize here because maybe\n\n166\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.010\nyou don't really see it in your mind, but\nyou do have to think about where is that\n\n167\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:22.910\npoint where the horizon meets with\nwherever I'm looking out towards.\n\n168\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.640\nAnd so you could start pulling this,\nI could pull this in.\n\n169\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.570\nI could go ahead and say, all right,\nlet's go, you know, down the vortex or\n\n170\n00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.130\nsomething.\n\n171\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.330\nAnd I can move this in, and\nyou can move all these things.\n\n172\n00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.010\nNow I'm getting a little crazy.\n\n173\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.890\nSo it's like, wait, I've kinda gotten so\nfar off because I've\n\n174\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.430\nswung the gates open too much,\nhow can I get back to where I started.\n\n175\n00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.660\nSo, back in the View menu,\nthis is where in the perspective grid,\n\n176\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:54.050\nyou do have these different presets\nthat we started with, okay?\n\n177\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.680\nSo, that one that we were doing\nwas a two-point perspective.\n\n178\n00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.890\nAnd you see it immediately switch back to,\nboom, there you are.\n\n179\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.670\nOkay?\n\n180\n00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.330\nAnd, just to show you\nthat if you wanted to do\n\n181\n00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.600\na one-point perspective in\nat just one side going down.\n\n182\n00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.900\nMaybe just like the side like a hallway or\na subway or something that affect.\n\n183\n00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.330\nYou can do it that way.\n\n184\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.446\nYou can also do it three-point perspective\nto where it gets a little bit more deep.\n\n185\n00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:20.763\n[LAUGH]\n>> Wow.\n\n186\n00:09:20.763 --> 00:09:24.790\n>> So, all of these are valid\nin drawing in Perspective.\n\n187\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.970\nIf you've taken any drawing class and\nyou're going to be learning about\n\n188\n00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.640\nPerspective, this is all in theory and\nthis is right along with it.\n\n189\n00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.252\nSo just keep in mind the vanishing point,\n\n190\n00:09:35.252 --> 00:09:37.550\nthe panes and\nwhich one you want to go with.\n\n191\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.640\nI'm going to go back to that\ntwo point perspective because\n\n192\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.790\nI think it demonstrates\nthe point the best.\n\n193\n00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.440\nAnd you can increase where\nthe grid starts and stops and\n\n194\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.240\nhow many grid lines go on it.\n\n195\n00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.180\nBecause a why would I want to increase or\ndecrease the amount of grid points or\n\n196\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.000\nintersections is because\nanything that you add\n\n197\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.290\nto the Perspective grid is\ngoing to snap to that grid.\n\n198\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.060\nSo that's like the,\n\n199\n00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.910\nthe level of snapness [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n200\n00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.930\n>> That you want.\n\n201\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.392\n>> And that's the technical term for it.\n\n202\n00:10:04.392 --> 00:10:06.255\n>> That is exactly the technical term.\n\n203\n00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:07.280\n[LAUGH] All right so\n\n204\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.210\nI'm just gonna go back to the default\nto keep it all nice and pretty.\n\n205\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.522\nAll right so,\nup here in this little control panel,\n\n206\n00:10:13.522 --> 00:10:18.264\nyou can see that if I hover over each one\nit's going to give me a tool tip, and\n\n207\n00:10:18.264 --> 00:10:22.209\nit's not coming up on my\nmagnification it's not staying up.\n\n208\n00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:27.309\nBut you can see that I have the left,\nthe right, the bottom,\n\n209\n00:10:27.309 --> 00:10:32.780\nthe green, or\nthere's a whole area outside that's none.\n\n210\n00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.360\nIf it's in the blue then that means\nif I start drawing something it's not\n\n211\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.440\ngonna be in Perspective.\n\n212\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.734\nSo that was that whole you can keep\nthe grid, you can hide it, and\n\n213\n00:10:40.734 --> 00:10:44.595\nyou can be off the grid and it'll still\nbe a regular document just the same.\n\n214\n00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:50.030\nSo just understanding what each one\nof those indicates is important.\n\n215\n00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:54.670\nSo I'm going to stay on the left, or\nthe left grid, notice in parentheses,\n\n216\n00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.760\nit does have a number one.\n\n217\n00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.093\nAgain, it's very very small, but\n\n218\n00:10:57.093 --> 00:10:59.055\nwhen you see it on your\nscreen you'll be able to see.\n\n219\n00:10:59.055 --> 00:11:01.374\nThose numbers will come into play\nwhen I start moving things around.\n\n220\n00:11:01.374 --> 00:11:04.238\nAll right, so\nI'm going to go over to my rectangular.\n\n221\n00:11:04.238 --> 00:11:05.798\nI almost said rectangular marquee.\n\n222\n00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:07.392\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is not Photoshop,\n\n223\n00:11:07.392 --> 00:11:08.435\nthis is Illustrator.\n\n224\n00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:10.590\n[LAUGH] This is the rectangle tool.\n\n225\n00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.030\nAnd I'm just going to throw a color\non there before I get started so\n\n226\n00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.290\nwe can just make it a little easier.\n\n227\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.670\nAnd as soon as I start drawing, see how\nit's actually staying in the perspective\n\n228\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.790\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n229\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.140\n>> Of that grid.\n\n230\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.530\nWhich is pretty neat.\n\n231\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.930\nAnd I could keep on going.\n\n232\n00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.160\nAnd if I draw it way out here,\nyou still see still on that grid.\n\n233\n00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.300\nIt's still staying in\nperspective that way.\n\n234\n00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.650\nNow if I wanted to flip over to the other\nside, like I want to now draw down\n\n235\n00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.670\nthe other side of the street, I just have\nto come up here to the little control and\n\n236\n00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.550\nsay well which grid do I want\nto activate to add that item.\n\n237\n00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.796\nSo I click on the right Grid and then I\nclick hold and drag and I can make that.\n\n238\n00:11:49.796 --> 00:11:50.397\nOkay?\n\n239\n00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:51.399\n>> Very neat.\n\n240\n00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:52.010\n>> Yeah.\n\n241\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.749\nAnd so you can just go ahead and start\nadding different pieces to whatever grid.\n\n242\n00:11:56.749 --> 00:12:01.803\nIf I wanted to draw like the floor if\nyou want to say, I can go ahead and\n\n243\n00:12:01.803 --> 00:12:07.500\ndraw here and you can see that now with\nthe color it's a little harder to see.\n\n244\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.549\nWow this is really pretty.\n\n245\n00:12:08.549 --> 00:12:09.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n246\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.320\nyou have the same rules that apply just\nlike anything, your stacking order,\n\n247\n00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.170\nthe layers and\nlike this is on top of everything.\n\n248\n00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.290\nSo you just start picking up plane,\ndraw the things on it and\n\n249\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.590\nthen you can do what you want.\n\n250\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.700\nNow this is where I would,\nI want to go back to the black arrow tool.\n\n251\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.620\nI still do it, and it's like, okay.\n\n252\n00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.154\nWell, if I go back to the black arrow tool\nbecause I wanna move it and change it,\n\n253\n00:12:31.154 --> 00:12:32.452\nwell, watch what happens.\n\n254\n00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:35.625\nI can still select it but\nif I move it, it's just,\n\n255\n00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:38.057\nthat's not staying in perspective.\n\n256\n00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:43.259\nIt's just keeping whatever item it is and\nkinda like the shape that it is and\n\n257\n00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:46.740\nit's not staying in the perspective, okay.\n\n258\n00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.620\nSo don't use the black arrow tool\nif you wanna stay in the grid.\n\n259\n00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.990\nSo you have to come over and\nget the Perspective selection tool.\n\n260\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.660\nNow once I come over here and grab this,\nnotice how if I move it down or\n\n261\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.800\nlike down the street if you wanna say,\nit stays like that-\n\n262\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.750\n>> It's start getting smaller and smaller.\n\n263\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.970\n>> It's using that vanishing point okay.\n\n264\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.572\nAnd if I move it up a bit,\nI can even go this way.\n\n265\n00:13:09.572 --> 00:13:14.410\nIt's like okay, that's little extreme but\nit is keeping on that same idea of,\n\n266\n00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.030\nthis is the perspective, that we're using.\n\n267\n00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.190\nSo that's pretty neat.\n\n268\n00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.080\nAnd you can see it, well I hope you can\nsee it, you can kinda feel it snapping.\n\n269\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.580\nAt least I can feel it snapping and\nso I can kinda come up here and\n\n270\n00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:31.220\nmove it up and say all right,\nwell there's that side of the building.\n\n271\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.850\nHere this is where I can go ahead and\njust do the Arrange.\n\n272\n00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.290\nI can send this to the back so\nthat looks like it's the floor.\n\n273\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.250\nNow the reason why we are doing it\nthis way is because I used this guy.\n\n274\n00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.230\nI’m just gonna go ahead and delete this,\nmake this a little bit bigger.\n\n275\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.280\nAnd so you can see you still have\nall the same things that you can do\n\n276\n00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.881\nwith editing and moving and\ntaking everything around.\n\n277\n00:13:50.881 --> 00:13:52.860\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Just staying in Perspective.\n\n278\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.140\n>> Okay are you, once you’ve drawn\nsomething on a particular plain and\n\n279\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.990\nthat Perspective grid,\nare you stuck with that?\n\n280\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.020\nOr can you move it from one grid to\nanother or just delete it and recreate it?\n\n281\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.195\n>> That's a great question,\nso let me show you.\n\n282\n00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:07.770\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna draw some windows and\nthen I don't wanna\n\n283\n00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.200\nrecreate the entire thing because we don't\nwanna keep doing that all night long.\n\n284\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.720\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and just,\n\n285\n00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.860\nI picked the side of the grid that I wanna\nadd, I went back to my rectangle tool,\n\n286\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.730\nand I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndraw a little window.\n\n287\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.250\nRight?\n\n288\n00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.565\nWe'll go, that's my window.\n\n289\n00:14:22.565 --> 00:14:24.417\n>> Mm-hm\n>> I'm gonna, see I almost went there.\n\n290\n00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:26.245\n[LAUGH] Gotta go back to\nthe perspective selection.\n\n291\n00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:28.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, now I'm here,\n\n292\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.360\nMaybe I want another\nwindow on the same side.\n\n293\n00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.340\nWe still have ALT drag, just like I\nwould have before and that's great.\n\n294\n00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.268\nAnd then I ALT drag again and\n\n295\n00:14:36.268 --> 00:14:40.370\nmaybe, wait, I wanted to actually\nmove that to the other side.\n\n296\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.800\nAnd that's what I think you're asking is,\nI wanna put that on the right side.\n\n297\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.490\nThis is one of those use of\nthe hot keys can be kind of fun.\n\n298\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.740\nRemember there is a one for\nthe left, three for\n\n299\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.790\nthe right, two for the horizontal or\nthe base the green.\n\n300\n00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.190\nSo I know that three is the hot key for\nthe right.\n\n301\n00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.030\n>> You can't see what I'm doing but\nI am going to explain.\n\n302\n00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.696\nSo I'm going to take this and\nI'm gonna click hold and drag.\n\n303\n00:15:03.696 --> 00:15:05.163\nI'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving.\n\n304\n00:15:05.163 --> 00:15:07.132\nI am going to hit the number three.\n\n305\n00:15:07.132 --> 00:15:08.244\nAnd it [SOUND].\n\n306\n00:15:08.244 --> 00:15:12.098\nIt turned the corner and\nI can move it on that side.\n\n307\n00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:12.770\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n308\n00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.240\n>> Yeah, that's pretty neat.\n\n309\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.270\nAnd I can do the same thing if I,\nlet me ALT drag this, you know\n\n310\n00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.850\nyou've got to get a little crafty with\nyour fingers and everything like that.\n\n311\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.210\nI can ALT drag, keep on going,\nlet me go ahead and then click the three,\n\n312\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.120\nflip the switch.\n\n313\n00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.560\nThere we go, and move her that way.\n\n314\n00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.520\nSo you can move and change planes if\nyou know the hotkeys and which way and\n\n315\n00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.610\nwhich plane you want to go to.\n\n316\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.400\nSo, I've always found that pretty fun.\n\n317\n00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.060\n>> Very cool.\n\n318\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.670\n>> Yes, very, very neat.\n\n319\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.950\nOkay, so that's where we've got\nto drawing and perspective,\n\n320\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.250\nkeeping the selection tool.\n\n321\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.320\nYou can go back to the view tool, or\nthe view menu and you know hide the grid.\n\n322\n00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.762\nSo now I don't actually, that sidewalk\nactually looks a little weird.\n\n323\n00:15:50.762 --> 00:15:52.234\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n324\n00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:53.881\n>> And again turn it back on.\n\n325\n00:15:53.881 --> 00:15:55.898\nThe snap to the grid is by default.\n\n326\n00:15:55.898 --> 00:16:00.275\nI would like to go ahead and\npoint this lock station point.\n\n327\n00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:03.570\nOkay, and\nlet me demonstrate it without it on first.\n\n328\n00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.410\nBecause if I come back over here and\nI've drawn this and I think it's great,\n\n329\n00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:11.760\nbut now I realize I need to basically\nchange the angle of the building.\n\n330\n00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.415\nI need to change.\n\n331\n00:16:12.415 --> 00:16:13.595\nThe vantage point.\n\n332\n00:16:15.045 --> 00:16:17.545\nYou do that with\nthe perspective grid tool.\n\n333\n00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:20.305\nThe perspective grid modifies the grid.\n\n334\n00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:22.995\nSo come back over here and\nI'm just going to move this over, and\n\n335\n00:16:22.995 --> 00:16:27.350\nyou can see that the building that\nis attached to it doesn't move.\n\n336\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.730\nOkay, by default, because it just doesn't.\n\n337\n00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.220\nYou could come back and\ndraw one thing in one perspective.\n\n338\n00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.170\nSay, okay, I'm done.\n\n339\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.010\nCome back, go to the perspective grid,\nput another perspective, so\n\n340\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.160\nyou can do some really cool things.\n\n341\n00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.000\n>> You can do some Escher-like stuff and\n\n342\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.290\nhave different perspectives\non the same drawing.\n\n343\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.630\n>> Exactly, yeah,\nyou can do some really neat stuff.\n\n344\n00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.088\nSo you might want to do that by default.\n\n345\n00:16:48.088 --> 00:16:50.340\nYou know by, on purpose.\n\n346\n00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.770\nI want to move this and\nnot have anything stay with it, but\n\n347\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:58.180\nin this example I do want to\nthe building to move with me.\n\n348\n00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.880\nSo that's where,\nif you go to the view menu and\n\n349\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.780\nyou go to that lock station point.\n\n350\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.460\nAnd this only changes the perspective,\nsorry the vanishing point, my bad,\n\n351\n00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.100\nit won't change, see if I swing\nthe gate open that's not gonna change.\n\n352\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:18.590\nBut if I change this guy,\ndo you see how now everything shifts?\n\n353\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:20.130\nSo, if you move the vanishing point.\n\n354\n00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.030\nI keep saying that.\n\n355\n00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.630\nYes, I said it right, actually.\n\n356\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.520\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you move the vanishing point,\n\n357\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:30.990\nit will move everything with you if\nyou have that lock point on, okay?\n\n358\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.990\nNot the gates, but the vanishing point.\n\n359\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.550\nAnd I know gates is not\nthe technical word, but,\n\n360\n00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.365\nto me,\nit's the easiest way to describe it, okay?\n\n361\n00:17:36.365 --> 00:17:38.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I think that's pretty neat.\n\n362\n00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.560\n>> That is.\n>> That can really help you.\n\n363\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.615\n>> You could really get creative\nwith something like that.\n\n364\n00:17:42.615 --> 00:17:43.440\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n365\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.380\nJust draw a grid, move it over.\n\n366\n00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.690\nI can see things in my brain,\nlike different advertisers or\n\n367\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.600\ndifferent art pieces.\n\n368\n00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.720\nWe're like, that's really cool.\n\n369\n00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.895\nWe could do that in illustrator.\n\n370\n00:17:54.895 --> 00:17:57.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's pretty neat, and\n\n371\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.600\nI guess that the last thing\nthat I wanted to review.\n\n372\n00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.720\nSince I put it in my notes,\nwas how to get that image in there.\n\n373\n00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.720\nI wanna put a picture or\na poster off to the side.\n\n374\n00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.864\n>> Normally, it does not go to the grid.\n\n375\n00:18:10.864 --> 00:18:11.940\n>> Correct.\n>> It's a raster.\n\n376\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.910\n>> Yeah and actually that does\nremind me that I missed one other\n\n377\n00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.370\npoint of dragging something into\nthe grid after it's not in there.\n\n378\n00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.505\nSo, let me give you two more points.\n\n379\n00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:23.210\n[LAUGH] So the image part.\n\n380\n00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.585\nLet me back up and\ntalk about drawing things or\n\n381\n00:18:25.585 --> 00:18:28.599\nadding things into the grid\nthat's not in perspective.\n\n382\n00:18:28.599 --> 00:18:34.320\nAll right, so,\nhere I've got the little control guide.\n\n383\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.600\nOops, I need to go ahead and\nget the right tool.\n\n384\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.275\nThere it is, sorry.\n\n385\n00:18:38.275 --> 00:18:40.910\n[LAUGH] That is the blend tool,\nwhere am I going?\n\n386\n00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:41.610\nAll right, here we go.\n\n387\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.220\nAll right, so I have decided that I\ndo not want anything in, on the grid,\n\n388\n00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.910\nbecause I want to add maybe a cloud or\nsome text.\n\n389\n00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.160\nMaybe I'll say hello.\n\n390\n00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.060\nThere we go.\n\n391\n00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.009\nAnd then maybe I'll draw like a square.\n\n392\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.150\nAll right, because I chose that I did\nnot want that to be in perspective.\n\n393\n00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.310\nI want it just flat, okay.\n\n394\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:09.300\nBut then, I realize that actually I really\ndo want to have that in perspective.\n\n395\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.820\nSorry, I'm just making this bigger so\nyou can see it.\n\n396\n00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:16.820\nSo that's where you take\nthe perspective selection tool.\n\n397\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.190\nWe grab any of these items and.\n\n398\n00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:23.400\nI do have to indicate a plane, I just\nrealized that, that I need to go ahead and\n\n399\n00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.000\nadd that one.\n\n400\n00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.390\nSo I'm on the left plane cuz I want\nto add the word hello on to the left.\n\n401\n00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.970\nSo I take this and I just drag it in.\n\n402\n00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.420\nSo you see how it actually kind of flips.\n\n403\n00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.385\n>> You can almost see as soon as you\n>> You selected it,\n\n404\n00:19:33.385 --> 00:19:35.605\nthe bounding box-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n405\n00:19:35.605 --> 00:19:37.095\n>> Will actually already snap to the grid.\n\n406\n00:19:37.095 --> 00:19:37.615\n>> Correct.\n\n407\n00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:39.665\nYeah, so it's like, okay, there we go.\n\n408\n00:19:39.665 --> 00:19:44.635\nAnd now, here we go, I'm in perspective,\nI've added it into that plane.\n\n409\n00:19:44.635 --> 00:19:47.730\nOkay, so\nthat's where It's not in perspective,\n\n410\n00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.940\ngrab it in, select PS tool,\nperspective selection tool, pick the grid.\n\n411\n00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.880\nSo if I wanted to take this guy I'll go\nahead and flip it onto the right grid,\n\n412\n00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.600\nbecause I have to always go back and\nindicate which grid I want\n\n413\n00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.910\nto go with first, and\nI just drag it in and I can go like so.\n\n414\n00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:10.110\nSo if you forget to put in\nyou can put it in later.\n\n415\n00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:14.100\nAnd that's where in here if I\ntried to take this image and drag.\n\n416\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.610\nIt saying it won't even let me.\n\n417\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.610\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's saying nope, you cannot do that.\n\n418\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.010\n>> And before you get to that image one\nmore question for you, so we can drag\n\n419\n00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:25.665\nthings into the grid with that perspective\nselection tool, if I got that right.\n\n420\n00:20:25.665 --> 00:20:28.475\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> What if I decide now that I dont want\n\n421\n00:20:28.475 --> 00:20:30.627\nthat in perspective anymore?\n\n422\n00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:36.300\nCuz you said one, two, three from my\nnumber is four though outer ring or?\n\n423\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.430\n>> Well yes, you can take it\nout of the perspective grid.\n\n424\n00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.380\nWhat it means, I can just take\nit out on the block air tool.\n\n425\n00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.440\nIf I just add the block air tool and\nmove this.\n\n426\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.250\nI mean, it's not gonna stay on\nperspective and then I can go back and\n\n427\n00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.600\nuse like the anchor.\n\n428\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.340\n>> The white arrow tool and now,\nit just looks like a regular\n\n429\n00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.970\nsquare and honestly, it might just be\neasier to just to delete it cuz you might.\n\n430\n00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.790\nWhen you go out of perspective,\nyou want it to stay flat again.\n\n431\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.800\nYou want it to go flat like\na regular square, but here it.\n\n432\n00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.750\n>> It's not gonna magically lose\nthe perspective or that twist and\n\n433\n00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.870\nshape that it got when we\nput it in perspective, so\n\n434\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.990\nyou might as well just start\nwith a nice square again.\n\n435\n00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.080\n>> Yeah, that's what I would say.\n\n436\n00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.950\nI think it would be easier.\n\n437\n00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.480\nSo, I mean, you can do that or\nyou could, you could also,\n\n438\n00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.710\nhere let me back up a little bit, I mean,\nyou could take this and you could cut it.\n\n439\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.680\nYou could come over to your perspective\ngrid tool or perspective selection and\n\n440\n00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.540\nsay no grid and then paste it.\n\n441\n00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.950\nSo now, it's just in nowhere land.\n\n442\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.480\nWhoops, I'm using the same tool.\n\n443\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.570\nYou know what?\n\n444\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.004\nJust delete it and\njust put it back in the regular world.\n\n445\n00:21:42.004 --> 00:21:42.610\n>> I like that idea.\n>> Yeah,\n\n446\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.250\nI think that's really the easiest way.\n\n447\n00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.210\nBecause it really,\nagain it's just a shape that has certain\n\n448\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.690\npoints in a certain way that makes\nit appear like it's in perspective.\n\n449\n00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.982\nSo I would say that.\n\n450\n00:21:52.982 --> 00:21:54.875\n>> All right, so let's see what\nwe can do with that picture.\n\n451\n00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:55.690\n>> All right.\n\n452\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.790\nSo we can go ahead and\nwe can try to drag this in,\n\n453\n00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.300\nit's gonna, I'm back to the PS tool.\n\n454\n00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.230\nWon't let me do it.\n\n455\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.200\nIt's like nope, you can not drag it,\nlike I dragged in the text or\n\n456\n00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.810\nI dragged in that square, right?\n\n457\n00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.950\nBut you can do it in a weird way.\n\n458\n00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.390\nNow one thing you have to do is you\nhave to have the image embedded,\n\n459\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.215\nit can not be linked.\n\n460\n00:22:17.215 --> 00:22:18.302\nOkay.\n\n461\n00:22:18.302 --> 00:22:23.644\nAnd, you take your regular selection too,\nnot the perspective selection.\n\n462\n00:22:23.644 --> 00:22:25.628\nAnd you take your regular selection,\n\n463\n00:22:25.628 --> 00:22:28.920\nyou make sure that the image is\nbehind the object that you want.\n\n464\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.440\nIt's basically like a clipping mask,\nreally.\n\n465\n00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.020\n>> Mm.\n\n466\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.880\n>> Remember doing\nclipping masks in images?\n\n467\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.880\nSo you're making a clipping mask but\nyou don't use the clipping mask command.\n\n468\n00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.410\nYou have to use this envelope\ndistort make with top object.\n\n469\n00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:43.110\nOkay, yeah.\n\n470\n00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.850\nIt's a weirder one, but it works.\n\n471\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:46.550\nOkay.\n\n472\n00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.030\nSo I'm back in my black arrow tool.\n\n473\n00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.250\nI'm gonna take this image and\nI'm gonna put it right here.\n\n474\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:56.030\nNow I know it's gonna be in the front\nbecause I did it that way, so\n\n475\n00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.470\nI'm going to go ahead and\narrange and sent to back.\n\n476\n00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.400\nJust like it's all the way in the back,\nbut I still have it selected,\n\n477\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.400\nI can see the frame.\n\n478\n00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.620\nYou know what I did?\n\n479\n00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.420\nI forgot to embed it.\n\n480\n00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.950\nLet me go ahead and\nembed that really quickly.\n\n481\n00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.680\nSo, all right.\n\n482\n00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.065\nGotta embed first sorry.\n\n483\n00:23:10.065 --> 00:23:12.260\n[LAUGH] Well that's a quick step so\nthere we go.\n\n484\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.700\nSo I have it selected it still.\n\n485\n00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.010\nI'm gonna hold my shift key and\nI'm gonna select that square right here.\n\n486\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.430\nSo I know I have those two items\nselected that there's the image and\n\n487\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.600\nthe square that I want it to show through.\n\n488\n00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.260\nAnd then,\nI'm gonna go to that object menu.\n\n489\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.610\nI'm gonna go to envelope distort,\nand I'm gonna make with top object.\n\n490\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.000\nAnd then, poof!\n\n491\n00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.740\nThere you go.\n\n492\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.980\nSo you can have the picture\nin perspective.\n\n493\n00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.830\nYou just have to skirt along the edges.\n\n494\n00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.080\n>> So the key there is you wanna make sure\nit was embedded, put it out there and\n\n495\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.130\nmake sure it's behind everything.\n\n496\n00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.350\nAnd then, with the picture still selected,\n\n497\n00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.015\nselect the shape that you\nwanted to conform to as well.\n\n498\n00:23:48.015 --> 00:23:49.730\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> So you had them both selected when you\n\n499\n00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.530\ndid that last step.\n\n500\n00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.040\n>> Yes, it's just like when\nyou create a clipping mask.\n\n501\n00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.930\nYou have the image underneath the frame\nthat you want to clip it into,\n\n502\n00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.410\nso the stacking order and\nthen just make with envelope to store it.\n\n503\n00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.450\nNow you can't really move it.\n\n504\n00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.462\nIf I try to use that perspective selection\ntool, it's not gonna let me move it, so\n\n505\n00:24:08.462 --> 00:24:10.746\nit's like it's kind of\nfixated in its place.\n\n506\n00:24:10.746 --> 00:24:14.910\nSo if you don't like it,\nyou basically have to back up.\n\n507\n00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.270\nYou have to undo and keep going.\n\n508\n00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:21.120\nNow you can go back to the black arrow\ntool, the regular selection tool, and\n\n509\n00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.320\nyou can select that Item,\ncuz it is showing up here in the control\n\n510\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.200\npanel that it is an envelope top.\n\n511\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.740\nSo I can go back to envelope distort and\n\n512\n00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.890\nrelease it, and then it's gonna release.\n\n513\n00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.470\nIt's going to say I'm not going to conform\nto what you are telling me to do anymore,\n\n514\n00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:43.750\nand then you can move on from there.\n\n515\n00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.490\nSo, yeah little trick,\nand that's where it is.\n\n516\n00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.410\nSo you can drag things into perspective.\n\n517\n00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:53.580\nYou can kind of drag things out,\nreally just delete them.\n\n518\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.714\nHide or show the grid,\ncreate the grid, and\n\n519\n00:24:56.714 --> 00:25:00.204\ndo some fun stuff with drawing and\nperspective.\n\n520\n00:25:00.204 --> 00:25:02.710\nSo that is your 3D drawing.\n\n521\n00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:03.700\n>> Fantastic, Vonne.\n\n522\n00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.390\nThank you for those great demonstrations.\n\n523\n00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.650\nReally cool, look at what we can\ndo with that perspective grid.\n\n524\n00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:12.820\nBe able to draw and\ngive it that perception of depth, right?\n\n525\n00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.310\nAnd give it that look of 3D.\n\n526\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.290\nI love it.\n\n527\n00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.070\nFantastic.\n\n528\n00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:21.580\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching,\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n529\n00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.450\n>> And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n530\n00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.484\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n531\n00:25:24.484 --> 00:25:32.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:20.630\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.568\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna learn how to export for\n\n5\n00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:26.350\nboth web and print, all right?\n\n6\n00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.830\nWe've spent a lot of time getting our\ndocument ready, we've learned all about\n\n7\n00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.230\nfonts and colors, and swatches, and\ngradients, and curves, and perspective\n\n8\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.920\ngrids and more things than I can even\nremember but now what do we do, right?\n\n9\n00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.800\nWe're done, we've got to either\nturn it in to our customer or\n\n10\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.340\nsend it off to the printer.\n\n11\n00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.350\nHow do we do that?\n\n12\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.830\nHere, luckily for us,\nVonne is here to show us the way.\n\n13\n00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.030\nHow are you doing, Vonne?\n>> Hi, I'm good.\n\n14\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.090\nReady to show you how to finalize\neverything because you get all into,\n\n15\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.230\nwhat am I going to create,\n\n16\n00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.050\nbut the final step is actually one\nof the most important ones and\n\n17\n00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.340\nit's really important that it goes\nback to the basics of graphic design.\n\n18\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.500\nI feel like it's Graphics 101,\nwhat are your file types,\n\n19\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.380\nwhat do they support, where am I going,\nwhat do I need to have for\n\n20\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.910\nmy resolution, and my color mode, and\nif you understand that at its core,\n\n21\n00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.850\nthen the steps to get it into\nthat is actually pretty simple.\n\n22\n00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.010\nSo I've given you,\nI've got a little roadmap.\n\n23\n00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.510\nOkay, my little matrix and schematics.\n\n24\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.790\nSo we always start with our .AI file,\nso if I'm going to\n\n25\n00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.090\ncreate my logo in Illustrator,\nit's gonna go on a website,\n\n26\n00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.290\nit's gonna go in print brochures, it's\ngonna go in magazines, it's gonna go all\n\n27\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.520\nover the place, so I need to be able\nto get it out into that format.\n\n28\n00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.890\nAll right so,\n\n29\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.660\nmy biggest point right here is, we've\ngone over how do we set up our document?\n\n30\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.330\nWhat color modes we need to be in?\n\n31\n00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.780\nAnd I put in big letter ARTBOARDS so\nyou're understanding why it's so\n\n32\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.550\nimportant to have your art\nboards the right size.\n\n33\n00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.680\nAnd what does that mean and\nhow many do I have?\n\n34\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.230\nWhat are their names?\n\n35\n00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.950\nWhat are their numbers?\n\n36\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.680\nBecause that makes a difference because\nyou use art boards to be able to create\n\n37\n00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.720\nmultiple versions of whatever\nartwork you're doing.\n\n38\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.920\nOne for like web banner size, one for\na full page ad, all of those things.\n\n39\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.520\nSo you have to know which one you\nwant to be able to get it out, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.200\nSo that's where I was just kinda\ngiving you some little pointers here.\n\n41\n00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.630\nSo the three ways that you can get\nthings out into a final format\n\n42\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.780\nwill be EXPORT,\nyou're actually doing a file export.\n\n43\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.140\nYou could do a Save for Web,\nor you can do a Save As.\n\n44\n00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.150\nMost important thing, we're creative\nvector graphics here in Illustrator.\n\n45\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.048\nIt is a vector editing program.\n\n46\n00:02:52.048 --> 00:02:57.160\nWell, jpegs, tifs, gifs,\nthose are all raster formats.\n\n47\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.540\nYou don't do a Save As like\nyou do sometimes in Photoshop,\n\n48\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.630\na lot of it's just File, Save As,\nin here you have to export it.\n\n49\n00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.460\nIt's like I am going to transition\nyou from a vector to a raster.\n\n50\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.190\nSo that's where the export\ncomes into play.\n\n51\n00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.980\nSo let's kinda concentrate on this one.\n\n52\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.840\nAgain, knowing your file types, what does\na JPEG support, what does a PNG support?\n\n53\n00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.000\nYour layer,\nwell actually not necessarily layers,\n\n54\n00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.860\nit's really more about the transparency\nand the amount of colors, okay.\n\n55\n00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.171\nAnd your web resolution is 72,\nyour print resolution is 300.\n\n56\n00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:32.210\nAll of these concepts we've talked\nabout in length in other episodes.\n\n57\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.180\nAnd you actually could export them out\nin different formats such as a TXT file,\n\n58\n00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.110\nif you really wanted to, but\n\n59\n00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.430\nthese are the ones you're probably\ngonna be working with most, okay.\n\n60\n00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.982\nSo that same, what do I do for\nweb imprint here?\n\n61\n00:03:46.982 --> 00:03:49.410\nCreating a raster graphic, okay.\n\n62\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.620\nAnd the art board check off,\nwhich I didn't put on there but\n\n63\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.390\nI did put up over here, I'll demonstrate\nwhen we go ahead and export that out.\n\n64\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.450\nLet's go over here to SAVE AS.\n\n65\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.560\nNow if you're doing a Save As,\nit's vector to vector.\n\n66\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.180\nSo I created a logo in Vector,\nI wanna keep it in Vector.\n\n67\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.080\nSo that's where you can\ncreate that into an EPS file,\n\n68\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.800\nyou can create that into a PDF file,\nand you could also go into the SVG or\n\n69\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.830\nthe SVGZ file format, the compressed\nversion of that scalable vector graphic.\n\n70\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.350\nBiggest points here, know what file\nyou are in or have open when editing.\n\n71\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.470\nWhat do you mean?\n\n72\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.660\nI can't tell you how many times\nthat I have taken a logo,\n\n73\n00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.360\nsaved it as an APS because\nI'm ready to go ahead and\n\n74\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.270\nsend that off to the tee shirt printer or\nwhatever, and then I started making edits\n\n75\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.280\non the EPS file and I save that and\nI come back to my AI file and I'm like,\n\n76\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.110\nwait I thought I thought I turned\nthat to green, why is it still pink?\n\n77\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.260\nSave As and I'm still in the EPS file.\n\n78\n00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.970\nIllustrator opens EPS files.\n\n79\n00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.070\nOr I created a PDF of that because I\nneeded to take that ad that I created and\n\n80\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.160\nmake it into a PDF form.\n\n81\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.410\nAnd then I'm editing the PDF.\n\n82\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.050\nBecause I wasn't paying attention\nto which file I was at.\n\n83\n00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.330\nSo I've done it a bunch of times.\n\n84\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.820\nThat's why I'm putting it\nas a little note for you.\n\n85\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.350\nKnow where you are.\n\n86\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.730\nIf you wanna go back and edit your\nnative file, go back to the okay, so.\n\n87\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.280\nAnd then understanding your PDF\nsettings and standards is important.\n\n88\n00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.250\nAnd we'll go through those options\nwhen I demonstrate to you.\n\n89\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.210\nSo that's vector to vector is Save As.\n\n90\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.840\nNow SAVE FOR WEB, this is going to create,\n\n91\n00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.570\nit's almost like exporting where you\nare creating Vector to Raster, but\n\n92\n00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.370\nin this sense, you're automatically\ngoing to set the resolution to 72.\n\n93\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.920\nIt is already going to be web resolution,\nyou do not get a choice of changing it to\n\n94\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.778\n300 or changing the color mode to CMYK\nbecause SAVE FOR WEB means web settings.\n\n95\n00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:46.230\nOkay, 72 R2B like I said.\n\n96\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.070\nAnd these are the file formats that\nyou can export out, or sorry Save for\n\n97\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.590\nWeb to the, well,\nweb versions of your raster file formats.\n\n98\n00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.940\nI did put in here that It will clip\nto the artboard automatically, so\n\n99\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.100\nyou don't have to worry about that part.\n\n100\n00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.775\nAnd the other neat thing\nis you can set new sizes,\n\n101\n00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:11.972\nbecause maybe you went ahead and\ncreated your logo 5 inches by 5 inches,\n\n102\n00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:16.470\nand the raster image you want to come out\nis only need to be 100 by 100 pixels,\n\n103\n00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.050\nyou can change that in the Save for\nWeb settings, which is kinda nice.\n\n104\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.670\nAnd just understanding the file\nformats is going to be key.\n\n105\n00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:30.100\nBut you can see the differences and\nit will let you change or\n\n106\n00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.780\nsave out slices and I'm going to\nkeep slices in another episode,\n\n107\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.190\nI'm just going to keep that all by itself.\n\n108\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.660\nBecause there's some interesting things\nof you can go ahead and save for\n\n109\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.310\nweb with slice but then how do you make\nslices and what does it even mean.\n\n110\n00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.680\nSo I'll save that for another one.\n\n111\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.730\nAll right, so here is the the overview, an\nunderstanding of why we want to do this.\n\n112\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.890\nSo now, how?\n\n113\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.600\nAll right, let's demonstrate.\n\n114\n00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.730\nI've got over here, too,\nmy logo, Hop-Along Hills.\n\n115\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.640\nAnd when I started this it's like\nI just take out a piece of paper,\n\n116\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.740\nI'm gonna start drawing.\n\n117\n00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.600\nI wasn't really concerned about what\nsize my artboard needed to be because I\n\n118\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.100\nwas just creating, I was just having fun,\nand now I'm ready, I've got my logo,\n\n119\n00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.920\nnow I'm ready to put it\nout to where I need to go.\n\n120\n00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.480\nIf I didn't know how to do this,\nif I went to File Export,\n\n121\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.210\nFile Export I wasn't really\npaying attention down here.\n\n122\n00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.470\nI'm just gonna go ahead and put this as\nexport out to here, I can go ahead and\n\n123\n00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.890\nchange the file formats\nto whichever one I want.\n\n124\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.800\nSo maybe in the sense that I need\nto go ahead and make this to,\n\n125\n00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.350\nI'll have to send this out as\na tiff file because it's for\n\n126\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.745\ncommercial printing for whatever reason,\nso I'm gonna use a tiff file for my logo.\n\n127\n00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:44.900\nSo I go ahead and make it a tiff,\nI put it in an export folder,\n\n128\n00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.073\nbecause I made that and\nI go ahead and export.\n\n129\n00:07:48.073 --> 00:07:54.007\nNow, any time I'm finished clicking the\nExport button You will always go ahead and\n\n130\n00:07:54.007 --> 00:08:00.900\nget the export options, whether it's TIFF,\nJPG, PNG, this is where you change things.\n\n131\n00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.950\nSo I got the 72.\n\n132\n00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.260\nThat's not what I want if\nI'm making [INAUDIBLE] so\n\n133\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.035\nI gotta make sure I gotta\nchange that to three 300.\n\n134\n00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:10.805\nAnd I am keeping it in\nthe CMYK color mode.\n\n135\n00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:13.363\nThis where you could choose\nyour compression or not.\n\n136\n00:08:13.363 --> 00:08:17.685\nWith the anti-aliasing I would\nalways keep it the default.\n\n137\n00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:19.875\nHonestly I wouldn't worry about that.\n\n138\n00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:20.800\nAnd I click OK.\n\n139\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.490\nAnd it writes my TIF file.\n\n140\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.990\nSo, if I come over to my export and\nI look at this,\n\n141\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:33.090\ndo you see how it cut off\nright at the edge of anything\n\n142\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:38.560\nthat it sees on the artboard, because\nI never specified anything different.\n\n143\n00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.580\nSo, it's always gonna It's basically\nsaying wherever the last piece of\n\n144\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.020\ninformation is, that's where I'm gonna\nmake the dimensions of the file.\n\n145\n00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.520\nAnd sometimes if you have something\nstraight point off to the side or\n\n146\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.460\nyou started a text box and never finished\nit, and it's just kind of out there.\n\n147\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.080\nWhy is all this extra space out there?\n\n148\n00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.210\nBecause it still sees it as information.\n\n149\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.470\n>> It's taking all the information you had\nand putting it into this final format.\n\n150\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.460\nOkay, so that's where it's like, but I\nreally wanted some white space around it.\n\n151\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.500\nOkay, well,\nyou gotta change your artboard.\n\n152\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.900\nAnd if I kept my artboard this big,\n\n153\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.590\nit's gonna be like the full size of\na piece of paper, so I don't want that.\n\n154\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:20.008\nSo I'm gonna do just a quick edit\nour artboard to say it's right here,\n\n155\n00:09:20.008 --> 00:09:22.820\nthere we go.\n\n156\n00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.610\nMaybe I can go ahead and\nmake it a little bit like two point five,\n\n157\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.720\nwe'll do that, OK.\n\n158\n00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.880\nAnd I can center, I knew that the logo was\ncentered in the artboard to begin with so\n\n159\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.676\nI know that there is an equal\namount of space, edit that prior.\n\n160\n00:09:34.676 --> 00:09:37.810\nAll right, so now I've got, yeah,\n\n161\n00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.080\nthat's the perfect amount of white\nspace that I want all around it.\n\n162\n00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.350\nAnd I want to now create this as my final\n\n163\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.710\nraster file dimensions\nwith the white space.\n\n164\n00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.850\nSo I'm going to go back to file export,\nand this time maybe instead of using\n\n165\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.810\na TIFF as an example, let's go with,\nI want to make this a JPEG.\n\n166\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.940\nOr maybe, let's go with PNG actually.\n\n167\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.450\nBecause why would I wanna\ndo a PNG versus a JPEG?\n\n168\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.170\nThe transparency support, okay?\n\n169\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.820\nSo I don't want to have a white\nbackground, that's the JPEG part.\n\n170\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.800\nSo, gotta check that box off right here,\nUse Artboards.\n\n171\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.520\nSo once I choose that, bring it out\ninto Export, and I go ahead and\n\n172\n00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.322\nexport this out.\n\n173\n00:10:17.322 --> 00:10:21.060\nSo you notice that my ping options or\nPNG options is,\n\n174\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.550\nwhat do you want the resolution?\n\n175\n00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.601\nYou could have a 300 PPI PNG file,\n\n176\n00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:31.400\nyou can,\nI wouldn't necessarily use a PNG file for\n\n177\n00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.770\nprint but it wouldn't be\nthe worst thing in the world.\n\n178\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.080\nTIFFs are gonna be the ones\nmore associated with it.\n\n179\n00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.130\nBecause of the compression.\n\n180\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.200\nSo I'll keep it at 72.\n\n181\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.080\nAnd right here is where I\ncould choose a transparent or\n\n182\n00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.910\na different color background, honestly.\n\n183\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.550\nSo maybe I did want a black background.\n\n184\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.870\nBut at least again,\nthese are the options that you have.\n\n185\n00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.850\nWith this particular file format.\n\n186\n00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.290\nSo you can say, yup that's what I want.\n\n187\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.560\nAn then there you go.\n\n188\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.640\nI've got my exported PNG, and\nif I go ahead and look at the information,\n\n189\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.760\nthis is what it translates into that\nthree inches by two and a half,\n\n190\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.850\ntranslates into,\nthis is how many pixels I have.\n\n191\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:15.920\nIf I did have a specific size\nthat I want to, to web graphic\n\n192\n00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.390\nthen you just changed your art board to\nwhatever size you wanted to export out.\n\n193\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.440\nIf you're doing the export command.\n\n194\n00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.250\nAll right, so that's how you can start\ndoing just a single art board with x So\n\n195\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.110\nam gonna try and give you some\nother examples and keep you going.\n\n196\n00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.880\n>> And so, and none of these options so\nfar have done anything to our original,\n\n197\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.530\nwe still have our .AI file.\n\n198\n00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.450\n>> Correct, yes.\n>> Okay.\n\n199\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:45.460\n>> Yes, we're not exporting we're\ncreating a completely separate one and\n\n200\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:51.092\nit's not going to\n>> Open itself in illustrator,\n\n201\n00:11:51.092 --> 00:11:53.620\nbut, good lead in to the next one.\n\n202\n00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.920\nI have my graphic or I have my logo and I\nneed to send this to the t-shirt company,\n\n203\n00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.810\nthey need an EPS version of my logo.\n\n204\n00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.930\nThat's where if I do a File, Save As,\ncuz you don't export vector to vector.\n\n205\n00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:11.200\nSo I'm doing a File, Save As and\nI'll go ahead and put it in my Export.\n\n206\n00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.940\nAnd I can do same filename\ncuz I haven't changed it.\n\n207\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.865\nAnd, oops sorry, gotta change the format.\n\n208\n00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:17.420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n209\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.340\n>> I'm gonna go to an EPS.\n\n210\n00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.960\n>> File format.\n\n211\n00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.520\nI'm going to go ahead and click save.\n\n212\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:27.070\nNow, the eps options are just going to\nsay well what version of Illustrator, but\n\n213\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.910\nI'm not saving it as an illustrator.\n\n214\n00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:35.410\nBut again, since Illustrator associates\nitself with an eps file format, if I'm\n\n215\n00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.320\nsaving, if I'm sending this to a printer\nthat needs like a lower version of.\n\n216\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.280\nThe Illustrator file format,\neven if it's EPS,\n\n217\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.470\nthat may be where you might change\nthat if you need to save down.\n\n218\n00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.565\nI hadn't run into too many problems with\nit before, also because a lot of your\n\n219\n00:12:52.565 --> 00:12:56.413\ncompanies are gonna usually have\nthe most [CROSSTALK] updated software.\n\n220\n00:12:56.413 --> 00:12:58.340\nBut just in case it is an option.\n\n221\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:03.314\nThis whole preview format because it's\na long story about how the encapsulate\n\n222\n00:13:03.314 --> 00:13:06.628\npost script actually has\na tiff wrapper around it for\n\n223\n00:13:06.628 --> 00:13:10.952\nwhen you preview it in a roster,\nagain, just say, that's great.\n\n224\n00:13:10.952 --> 00:13:11.891\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n225\n00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:12.949\n>> You don't wanna go to far.\n\n226\n00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:13.639\n>> [SOUND]\n>> And\n\n227\n00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:15.585\nreally just save all of\nthe rest of the options.\n\n228\n00:13:15.585 --> 00:13:19.460\nAnd you go ahead and\nclick OK, and now I'm done.\n\n229\n00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.160\nBut remember, where am I at?\n\n230\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.660\nI'm in the EPS.\n\n231\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.670\nSo if I go back and like, I really\nwanna change this or do something.\n\n232\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:27.889\nAnd I change it and save it.\n\n233\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.600\nNow my AI file is no longer out.\n\n234\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.150\nIt's back to where it's started from.\n\n235\n00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.910\n>> Okay.\n\n236\n00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.440\n>> So that's important to\n\n237\n00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.240\npoint out because again I've\ndone it too many times okay.\n\n238\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.750\nSo I go back to my AI file.\n\n239\n00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.610\nSee?\nIt's right back in the big one.\n\n240\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.330\n>> The big art board.\n\n241\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.770\n>> Yeah,\nbecause all the changes that we made.\n\n242\n00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.400\nWe did everything and did a save as and\nnow it's saved as an EPS file.\n\n243\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.250\n>> So\nall the changes were saved in the EPS.\n\n244\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.490\nMy AI file said, well okay.\n\n245\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.630\nNone of those changes were for me.\n\n246\n00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.290\nI'm back to the original.\n\n247\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.400\n>> Correct.\n\n248\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.740\nSo, great demonstration of\nknowing what file you're in.\n\n249\n00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.290\nGreat, Lehman.\n\n250\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.100\nThank you for that.\n\n251\n00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.970\n>> You're very welcome.\n\n252\n00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:12.290\nAlright, so\nlet's move on to multiple art boards, and\n\n253\n00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:16.670\nthen we'll also get into the save for\nweb option that I wanted to keep with you,\n\n254\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.970\nbecause you don't have to do the save for\nweb if you know like, I want a JPEG, and\n\n255\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:26.030\nI want 72, like you can use export, so why\nwould you want to use the save for web?\n\n256\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.940\nI'll get there.\n\n257\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.140\nAlright, so\nhere I got my spring art festival.\n\n258\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.420\nMultiple art boards.\n\n259\n00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.860\nNow with art boards and you are document\nsettings when you set a bleed,\n\n260\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.990\nthe bleed goes for all of your art boards,\n\n261\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.560\nlike you cannot set one to have\nno bleeds and one to have bleeds.\n\n262\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.480\nIt's just an all or nothing type of thing.\n\n263\n00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.710\nSo keep that in mind for\nwhen we get there.\n\n264\n00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.630\nHere is this art board and\nthis is an eight and\n\n265\n00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:57.110\na half by 11 ad and\nI want to send this to the printer, and\n\n266\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.880\nthey've requested that they want in\na PDF format, and more than that,\n\n267\n00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:06.090\nthey want it as a print ready to\ngo Full bleeds like all the way,\n\n268\n00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.800\ncolor to the edge, where they are going\nto do their crop marks and everything.\n\n269\n00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.960\nYou have to send them\nthat print ready file.\n\n270\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.130\nSo this is where I want to\ngo over PDF options and\n\n271\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.560\nmaking sure you understand\nthe exporting your artboards.\n\n272\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.410\nSo, I said export because it does feel\nlike you are exporting the file out,\n\n273\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.250\nbut it’s a PDF so\nyou are going to do what?\n\n274\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.460\nSave for the Web.\n\n275\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.380\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n276\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.000\n>> I'm sorry, we're gonna Save As.\n\n277\n00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.695\n>> There you go!\n\n278\n00:15:30.695 --> 00:15:31.603\n[LAUGH]\n>> Save As.\n\n279\n00:15:31.603 --> 00:15:34.320\n[LAUGH]\n>> You got the first part right, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.950\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH] So, I put you on the spot too.\n\n281\n00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:37.973\n>> No, that's okay.\n\n282\n00:15:37.973 --> 00:15:40.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, I did a File > Save As,\n\n283\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.620\ncuz we're going vector to vector.\n\n284\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.112\nAnd, that's what we got with PDF.\n\n285\n00:15:44.112 --> 00:15:47.818\nSo, I'm gonna come out here\nHere I'm going to go to\n\n286\n00:15:47.818 --> 00:15:50.328\nchange the file type to a PDF okay.\n\n287\n00:15:50.328 --> 00:15:54.552\nSpring festival and\nmaybe I'll just go ahead and\n\n288\n00:15:54.552 --> 00:15:58.373\nsay Full page add, just to be descriptive.\n\n289\n00:15:58.373 --> 00:16:03.900\nAll right, so there is my PDF, and\nit is going to use your art boards.\n\n290\n00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.800\nBut notice how,\nbecause that's automatically,\n\n291\n00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.020\nit's like I'm going to use your art\nboard whether you like it or not.\n\n292\n00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.830\nBut right now,\nif I wasn't paying attention,\n\n293\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.280\nit would be giving me\nall of my art boards.\n\n294\n00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.820\n>> Aha.\n>> All four of them, and\n\n295\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.210\nI don't want that.\n\n296\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.500\nSo that's where choosing the range,\nlike what do I want to,\n\n297\n00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.190\nand it's not gonna give\nyou the default one.\n\n298\n00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:27.860\nSometimes in Word it'll say pages one\nthrough six, cuz you have six pages.\n\n299\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.660\nIt doesn't think that way for you so\nyou gotta know where you're going, and\n\n300\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.530\nwhat am I doing?\n\n301\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.260\nI only want to have art board one.\n\n302\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.890\nThat's the one I want.\n\n303\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.080\nAnd if I wanted both of them, maybe like\nif I'm doing like my full page ad and\n\n304\n00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.590\nmy half page ad because this one over\nhere I know it's a half page ad.\n\n305\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.610\nSo I could export out both of them.\n\n306\n00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.940\nNow, as a PDF it's going\nto export out as one file.\n\n307\n00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.230\nLike one PDF file with two pages.\n\n308\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.000\n>> Pages.\n\n309\n00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.160\n>> So if you're printing one that way\nyou'll have to export out each one\n\n310\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.840\nindividually.\n\n311\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.510\nOkay, but so I'm just going to go\nahead and I'll keep the one and\n\n312\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.400\ntwo just for fun.\n\n313\n00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.160\n>> Silly question, I know you've covered\nthis already but my memory isn't the best.\n\n314\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.864\nHow did you know there was hard port one?\n\n315\n00:17:06.864 --> 00:17:09.326\n>> Let me show you.\n\n316\n00:17:09.326 --> 00:17:13.680\n[LAUGH] I know this file,\nyou don't know this file.\n\n317\n00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.220\nI have my art boards panel and,\n\n318\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.870\nI actually moved it up to the top so\nit's above my head.\n\n319\n00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.140\nSo.\nI have my art boards and\n\n320\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.900\nwhen I created this I was able\nto change the stocking, or well,\n\n321\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.480\nthe numbers and which ones they are and\nthat's where if I came into here.\n\n322\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.330\nI know that that is artboard\none this is artboard two and\n\n323\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.180\nthat also comes back into\nwhere I have my artboard tool.\n\n324\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:46.420\nYou can see that when I made that artboard\nthis is where I could give it a name and\n\n325\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.410\nI can change what number\nI wanted them to be,\n\n326\n00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.960\nbecause it all goes in the order\nthat you created the art board.\n\n327\n00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.620\nBut actually,\nI had actually had these out of order.\n\n328\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.780\nLike, I had this one, see it's not going\nto change the location, it's just changing\n\n329\n00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.070\nthe order and the number that\nyou are assigning the art board.\n\n330\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.510\nSee, it didn't move, right?\n\n331\n00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.890\n>> It's not like layers where\nyou're changing the stacking there.\n\n332\n00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.030\nYou're just actually changing, okay,\nI want this to be our board four.\n\n333\n00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.560\n>> And, because when I was going\nthrough it, to me it's like well,\n\n334\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.280\nI have a print, web, web, then a print.\n\n335\n00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.270\nLet me go ahead and\njust take that and move it up and so\n\n336\n00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.300\nnow you are going to be\nassigned art board number two.\n\n337\n00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.457\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n338\n00:18:27.457 --> 00:18:29.640\n>> And my order of art boards.\n\n339\n00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.520\nOkay.\nSo the number is really more for\n\n340\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.080\nyour benefit.\n\n341\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.610\nIt's like an automatic assign for\n\n342\n00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.495\nwherever you put it in the stacking\norder of your artwork.\n\n343\n00:18:39.495 --> 00:18:40.034\n>> Gotcha.\n\n344\n00:18:40.034 --> 00:18:44.570\n>> So yes, I know that those are the\nnumbers That I want to export out for\n\n345\n00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.800\nthe two ones that I want to be PDFs.\n\n346\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.680\n>> And if you just needed to know,\n\n347\n00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.500\nyou can always just open up the artboard\npanel then and see which one is which.\n\n348\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.350\n>> Correct, yes, right.\n\n349\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.120\nGreat review!\n\n350\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.630\n>> Yes.\n\n351\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.560\n>> So let's go to File > Save As, and\n\n352\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.290\nI'm going to use my, well,\nlet me change the file format first.\n\n353\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.250\nOkay, I'll use the art board.\n\n354\n00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.260\nAnd actually since I was\ngoing to export both of them,\n\n355\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.505\nthen it wouldn't be a full page ad,\nso you saved me in my naming.\n\n356\n00:19:10.505 --> 00:19:14.080\n[LAUGH] We'll just go ahead and\nsay Festival For\n\n357\n00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.820\nPrint, there we go, and\nI'll put it in my Export folder.\n\n358\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.470\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and save.\n\n359\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.670\nAnd again, getting to the options.\n\n360\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.070\nIt's always export or save as.\n\n361\n00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.810\nAnd then your options of\nwhatever you've chosen for those.\n\n362\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.245\nAll right, PDF, and PDF presets.\n\n363\n00:19:32.245 --> 00:19:34.620\nI could go forever about this so\nI'm gonna keep it short.\n\n364\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.325\n[LAUGH]\nBasics,\n\n365\n00:19:38.325 --> 00:19:40.805\nyou have presets of, what is a preset?\n\n366\n00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:44.333\nIt's basically pre determined\ncharacteristics or\n\n367\n00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:48.175\nsettings of whatever your options will be.\n\n368\n00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:50.285\nIllustrator default will be fine for\nthis one but\n\n369\n00:19:50.285 --> 00:19:51.835\nI'm gonna go with high quality print.\n\n370\n00:19:51.835 --> 00:19:57.290\nNow high quality print you see all\nof these topics or items over here\n\n371\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:02.060\nin your PDF settings, your general,\nyour compression, your more assemblies.\n\n372\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.160\nYour output how it's actually going\n\n373\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.680\nto treat color conversion,\ncuz we always say CMYK, CMYK, CMYK.\n\n374\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.790\nWell what if I had anything that\nis in RGB in the PDF Settings,\n\n375\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.500\nyou could actually say make\nsure you convert everything.\n\n376\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.810\nYou can say without a doubt make\nsure everything's in CMYK and\n\n377\n00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.330\ndo all the color conversions for\n\n378\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:27.084\nme, cuz that would be a good thing if\nI'm doing for commercial printing.\n\n379\n00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:31.050\nSo these pre sets will determine that,\n\n380\n00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:36.450\nlike in High Quality Print for\nImages, it's going to\n\n381\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:42.470\noutput out images that will be at a 300,\nsee right there in my compression.\n\n382\n00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.050\nIt's going to say, all right,\neven if you're above 300 but\n\n383\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.190\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nmake you into 300 for print resolution.\n\n384\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.600\nWell watch if I change the preset to\n\n385\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.120\nSmallest File because you can\nhave PDF's on a website, right?\n\n386\n00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.070\nSo here's our ad for\nthe weekly coupon or whatever.\n\n387\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.280\nYou still want to be in PDF but\n\n388\n00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.750\nnot high quality because that\nis gonna be too big, right?\n\n389\n00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.220\nSo we change the smallest file size,\n\n390\n00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.630\nthere you could see it's actually changed\nthe compression rating down is going to\n\n391\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:14.860\ncompressed my images that if I print\nthe resolution they're gonna go smaller.\n\n392\n00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.040\nSo these are the presets that you have.\n\n393\n00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.160\nNow there's some other ones in here.\n\n394\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.810\nPDF X Standards, these are.\n\n395\n00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:27.140\nStandards that were created that\nare used pretty much primarily\n\n396\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.660\nin the commercial print industry, and\nthat's where the whole color conversion.\n\n397\n00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:37.450\nYou will from time to time get print\nshops that might say, make sure you save\n\n398\n00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:43.670\nin a PDF/X 1A format, and\nthat's probably the most widely used one.\n\n399\n00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.510\nWhy?\nBecause if you choose that,\n\n400\n00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.750\nit is doing that color conversion, okay?\n\n401\n00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.340\nSo it's seeing it, right there.\n\n402\n00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.100\nIt doesn't matter what it comes with but\ngo ahead and\n\n403\n00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.720\nmake sure that the color\nis changed into CMYK.\n\n404\n00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:01.160\nAnd if you didn't know that's\nwhat it was doing If you just use\n\n405\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.800\nthis preset, this is just built into\nany parameter that has Save For PDF,\n\n406\n00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.070\nit's always going to be an option so\na print company can\n\n407\n00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:14.160\nsay just choose that option and it knows-\n>> That way they know you're all iii,\n\n408\n00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.800\nthey don't have to explain or\nteach you or any of that.\n\n409\n00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.920\n>> Yeah, pretty much.\n\n410\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.020\nYeah.\nSo it's Becomes a standard.\n\n411\n00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:25.010\nSo, there are other PDFX standards.\n\n412\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.870\nYou can see the three, the four,\nand I believe there's another one.\n\n413\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:33.370\nThat gets very long, extensive,\nand very technical, okay?\n\n414\n00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:38.260\nJust understand that they do\nhave slash x standards and\n\n415\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.450\nthat the one a is primarily for\ncommercial print.\n\n416\n00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:46.680\nWhy am I saying that, ac and\nac test questions, they will ask you.\n\n417\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.220\nYou don't have to know the technicality\nof it you just have to know it exists and\n\n418\n00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.070\nyou can chose it and you're like yep,\nthat's for commercial printing.\n\n419\n00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.270\nThat's the one they usually go for.\n\n420\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.180\nOkay.\nSo back to here.\n\n421\n00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.240\nIf I choose high-quality print,\nthere's the standards again.\n\n422\n00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.130\nSee, there's another one.\n\n423\n00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.782\nSee, I knew there was one for 2010.\n\n424\n00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:06.930\n[LAUGH] So you could change it from there.\n\n425\n00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.860\nThe compatibility honestly I\nwouldn't mess with that too much.\n\n426\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.130\nThat gets another, remember I can talk\nforever about pdsf, I mean that goes\n\n427\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.650\na whole other technical level just know\nthat there are compatibility that if you\n\n428\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.700\ngo to high, someone would\nhave to have a higher version\n\n429\n00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.810\nof acrobat to be able to open you know,\nmodify that so it keeps it pretty\n\n430\n00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:35.310\nlow in the compatibility,\njust to cover all your bases.\n\n431\n00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.100\nYou always want to cover yourself.\n\n432\n00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.030\nYou don't want to go too high and\nhave a problem,\n\n433\n00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.319\nso I don't usually mess\nthe compatibility that much.\n\n434\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:49.075\nOne last part about PDFs is the marks and\nbleeds, okay?\n\n435\n00:23:49.075 --> 00:23:51.200\nBecause I created those bleeds and\n\n436\n00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.800\nI want the printer to know that\nI do have crop marks, okay?\n\n437\n00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.478\nThis is where you turn them on,\nI say yes I do have bleeds.\n\n438\n00:23:58.478 --> 00:23:59.547\nSo use that.\n\n439\n00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:05.160\nMake sure that color goes all the way\npast the edge of the final trim size.\n\n440\n00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.740\nAnd I usually check on all printers mark.\n\n441\n00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.760\nSome of them, some print shops\nmight say like turn them on but\n\n442\n00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.760\nonly give me the trim marks.\n\n443\n00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.280\nI also know like my thing\nthere was an offset.\n\n444\n00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.880\nOne print shop, they would always\ntell me to up the offset on it.\n\n445\n00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.970\nYou gotta talk to your print shop and\nask them what they want.\n\n446\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.250\nAnd that's where, a lot of the times,\nyou send them the native file anyways.\n\n447\n00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.930\nI would package the AI file, send them\nthe native, and the print-ready PDF,\n\n448\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.710\nbut, at least,\nyou get an idea of at least where it's at.\n\n449\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.930\n>> Right.\n>> Okay, when they say turn on printer\n\n450\n00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.300\nmarks\n>> Turn on bleeds,\n\n451\n00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:42.150\nyou know that's in the marks and\nbleeds settings within the PDF settings.\n\n452\n00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.370\nOkay, so I think I got everything I want.\n\n453\n00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:47.430\nI got that standard,\nI modified it with the marks and bleeds.\n\n454\n00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.630\nI go ahead and save the PDF.\n\n455\n00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.740\nAnd then that's what I've got.\n\n456\n00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.490\nJust open it up so you can see that this\nis a print ready file, I've got my crop so\n\n457\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:57.320\nit knows where to go.\n\n458\n00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.910\nIt does have that half page ad\nas well because I exported out\n\n459\n00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.290\nboth of those art boards, but notice it\ndoesn't have art board three and four.\n\n460\n00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:09.530\nBecause I didn't designate that.\n\n461\n00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.380\nFew more things.\n\n462\n00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.310\nWhy do I name my art boards?\n\n463\n00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.080\nThat's important.\n\n464\n00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.840\nBecause maybe I'm doing all web based\ndesign and I have all sorts of different\n\n465\n00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.500\nversions of my logo or artwork and I've\ngot them all the exact size that I want.\n\n466\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.130\nAnd I want to just put them all out.\n\n467\n00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.550\nOkay.\nTake them all.\n\n468\n00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.760\nI want every single one of them.\n\n469\n00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.480\nIf you go to Export and\nyou go to Use artboards.\n\n470\n00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.720\nI wanna get all of them.\n\n471\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.520\nI'm going to say All of my artboards.\n\n472\n00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.580\nMaybe I'll just use a JPEG for\nnow for fun.\n\n473\n00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.280\nI'm just gonna say name_.\n\n474\n00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.420\nThere's a reason why.\n\n475\n00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.380\nHm, why.\n\n476\n00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.685\n>> Hm.\n>> Because.\n\n477\n00:25:52.685 --> 00:25:53.765\n[LAUGH] Hm, why do you think?\n\n478\n00:25:53.765 --> 00:25:56.430\n>> [LAUGH] I'm gonna take\na big guess here, and\n\n479\n00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.750\nI'm gonna say that,\nduring that X4 process,\n\n480\n00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.520\nit might use the name of the artboard for\nthe file that it's generating.\n\n481\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.450\nYou are correct.\n\n482\n00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:04.310\nSo I can do that.\n\n483\n00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.150\nAnd so, if I go ahead and say all of them,\n\n484\n00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:11.270\nlet me put in my export and\nI'm going to export this out.\n\n485\n00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.070\nAnd I will go with RGB.\n\n486\n00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.710\nAnd this might be,\neven if it wasn't for all web,\n\n487\n00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.690\nmaybe I was sending software to\nmy client for proofing, right.\n\n488\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:23.100\nI just wanna show you What you got, what\nI have been making, so you can see it and\n\n489\n00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:28.490\nI will change the resolution to 72,\nthe quality is 8, that's good, so I\n\n490\n00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:34.700\nclick okay, and then I come back over and\nlook at what it did, just like you said.\n\n491\n00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.760\nSo it used the names of my artboard.\n\n492\n00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.430\nSo doing that planning step\n\n493\n00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:47.210\nof making sure you've got everything\nto the specs the names, it can\n\n494\n00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:51.530\nreally help you when you're at this final\nstage and you're like, I'm ready to go.\n\n495\n00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:56.460\nI will give you this one\ntip with the exporting.\n\n496\n00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:00.890\nWhen you're using documents that\nhave bleeds, here I'll show you.\n\n497\n00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:05.430\nThis one, I know it's 500 pixels by\n500 pixels because I know that's\n\n498\n00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.320\nwhat I set the art board You see here.\n\n499\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.108\nIt's actually adding those bleeds on it.\n\n500\n00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:10.710\n<<.\n\n501\n00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.300\n<< Yeah, the export will always add\nyour bleeds onto it when you're\n\n502\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.150\nsaving out all the art boards at once.\n\n503\n00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.510\nSo that's something like okay, well\nmaybe I'll make my art boards that much,\n\n504\n00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.720\nbecause I have,\nbecause I'm doing a print and web.\n\n505\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.320\nHonestly, There's other ways.\n\n506\n00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.950\nSometimes, if I'm just doing straight-up\nweb, I will not, you know, I'll keep my\n\n507\n00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.210\nprint stuff for one art project in one\nfile, and my web versions in another file,\n\n508\n00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.650\ncuz I know that I'm gonna have\nto do these types of things.\n\n509\n00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.790\nBut there's an alternative.\n\n510\n00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.430\nAnd that's the safer web option.\n\n511\n00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:46.950\nAlright, so\nback over here I've got my file and\n\n512\n00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.620\nthis one right here, I know, and notice\nhow I'm on this art board, right, or I can\n\n513\n00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:54.640\neven just select it here, I didn't have to\nclick it with the black arrow tool, but\n\n514\n00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.380\nthis is the art board that I got.\n\n515\n00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.270\nWhen I go to file, save for web,\n\n516\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:04.450\nit will only export\nthe artwork that I have On,\n\n517\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.760\nyou can't, you can't export multiple\nart boards and say for web.\n\n518\n00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.680\nIt's just like a one thing.\n\n519\n00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.960\nSo that's right, perfect,\nthen look at the size that it's giving me.\n\n520\n00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.248\n>> It looks like all your bleed is gone.\n\n521\n00:28:15.248 --> 00:28:16.829\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n522\n00:28:16.829 --> 00:28:20.630\nIt's adhering to the actual\nsize of the art board.\n\n523\n00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:24.820\nBecause the art board is 400, 500 by 300\nThe bleeds were just if I was ever going\n\n524\n00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.480\nto exit out, using those bleed\nsettings for my PDF options.\n\n525\n00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.130\nSo that's the whole thing,\nthat's exactly what I want.\n\n526\n00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.390\nIn a save for web,\nyou are on the optimized version, and\n\n527\n00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:40.250\nyou can go through here, and there\nare those file formats that I told you.\n\n528\n00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.520\nYou can pick which ones that you want,\nwhether or not you had transparency,\n\n529\n00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.610\nthis doesn't have transparency, so I can't\ndemonstrate it, but if you go through and\n\n530\n00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:50.550\nchoose that Like, if I was in\nthe Hopalong Hills, it will show\n\n531\n00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:55.180\nall the different qualities of the\ntransparency versus the not transparency.\n\n532\n00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.660\nGIF will go ahead and give me that.\n\n533\n00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.000\nSee, this is that color table.\n\n534\n00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.795\nThose are those 256 colors.\n\n535\n00:28:59.795 --> 00:29:02.840\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That are being used in that file.\n\n536\n00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.590\nYou have your PNG8, which we know\nis the same thing, basically.\n\n537\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.140\nThe PNG24.\nWhether you want your.\n\n538\n00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.920\nTransparency or not, and then your jpegs,\nyou can change quality, so\n\n539\n00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.460\nall of those qual,\nthings that you can do and\n\n540\n00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.660\nknow about those file formats you\ncan set right here in your presets.\n\n541\n00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.830\nAnd the nice thing is right here is that\nit will go ahead and allow you to export\n\n542\n00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:29.570\nout at a different size than what you\nput it at, and you can change the.\n\n543\n00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.930\nThe proportions, so\nthat's where I click yes, I want.\n\n544\n00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.420\nNow it does automatically click to our\nboard so that's like what you always want\n\n545\n00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.650\nto have one because see now it's\nlike whoa that's a little crazy,\n\n546\n00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:44.560\nlike you saw it was everything that\nthey could see the illustrator file,\n\n547\n00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.120\nso you want to go ahead and\nclick to art board.\n\n548\n00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.479\nSo I'll go ahead and click save.\n\n549\n00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.330\nAnd you can see I'm back to the same idea.\n\n550\n00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.900\nI'm really going through this extensively\nbecause I wanna just make sure you\n\n551\n00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:04.030\nunderstand every single option\nthat you have available to you.\n\n552\n00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:08.416\nAnd now you can see that there's\nmy file that I just created.\n\n553\n00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:08.922\nThere it is.\n\n554\n00:30:08.922 --> 00:30:11.140\n[LAUGH] Starting to get a little,\n\n555\n00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.280\nI probably should have named\nthem a little bit differently.\n\n556\n00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.230\nBut now I've got all of\nmy different options.\n\n557\n00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:21.070\nSo Save for Web is great for\ngoing to web just directly.\n\n558\n00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.248\nYou don't have to worry about resolution.\n\n559\n00:30:22.248 --> 00:30:23.136\nI never set a resolution.\n\n560\n00:30:23.136 --> 00:30:24.848\nI never set a color mode.\n\n561\n00:30:24.848 --> 00:30:29.356\nAnd I was on the artboard that\nI wanted to create out into\n\n562\n00:30:29.356 --> 00:30:32.780\na raster file format using that option.\n\n563\n00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.770\nSo it is artboard specific,\nand it's pretty great.\n\n564\n00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.440\nI think I've covered everything.\n\n565\n00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.170\n>> Wow.\nA lot of information there.\n\n566\n00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:44.620\nA lot of decisions to make when\nyou're at that final stage.\n\n567\n00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.660\nWe took a loot at exporting and\nsave as and save for web.\n\n568\n00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.210\nGreat look.\n\n569\n00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:49.860\nThank you for that.\n\n570\n00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.370\nGreat demonstrations explaining all the\ndifferent options that we have available.\n\n571\n00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.940\nAnd when we would want to\nuse those different methods.\n\n572\n00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.180\nSo we thank you for that, Vaughn.\n\n573\n00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.060\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n574\n00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.550\nSigning off for ITPro.tv,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n575\n00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.320\n>> And I'm Vaughn Smith.\n\n576\n00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.365\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n577\n00:31:04.365 --> 00:31:12.430\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.797 --> 00:00:19.360\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.260\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're gonna be slicing for the web.\n\n6\n00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.532\nWe talked a little bit,\nwe hinted at it in a previous episode.\n\n7\n00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:31.441\nWe're looking at our exporting for our\nweb or print, and we're gonna go back and\n\n8\n00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:34.431\ncover that with a little more depth,\nand here to help us that,\n\n9\n00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:36.470\nis Miss Van Smith, how are you doing Van?\n\n10\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.210\n>> Great!\n\n11\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.532\nReady to slice and dice,\nready for some pizza.\n\n12\n00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:41.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm hungry.\n\n13\n00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.525\n>> Right, I know.\n\n14\n00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:44.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and\n\n15\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.140\nhonestly I do use that analogy\nwhen I talk about what do we do,\n\n16\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.470\nand why would we want to slice things,\nI mean it's just It's one pizza, right.\n\n17\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.438\nAnd you chop it into individual slices and\nyou take the slice and you eat it.\n\n18\n00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:01.009\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:05.790\n>> [LAUGH] But the same idea is I go\nahead and have a whole illustrator file.\n\n20\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.560\nMaybe I have created a mock up for\nmy website.\n\n21\n00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.536\nI don't want to export the entire\nthing out as an image.\n\n22\n00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:18.485\nBut the pieces that I used in the mock up,\nthe images, I want that for my website.\n\n23\n00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:22.865\nSo I can slice it and\nI can bring out, export,\n\n24\n00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:27.450\nsave, I can export out\njust that one slice.\n\n25\n00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.130\nAnd the other cool thing is\nthat I can take slices and\n\n26\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.220\noptimize them differently and when we talk\nabout optimizing web graphics that really\n\n27\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.160\nmeans Optimizing for the right file type.\n\n28\n00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.170\nRemember the whole JPEG, PNG, GIF,\ntransparency, not transparency, colors.\n\n29\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.930\nAnd also making sure I have\nthe smallest file size for\n\n30\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.000\noptimal load time for the web.\n\n31\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.940\nOkay, so that's what it means\nby optimizing your web graphics.\n\n32\n00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.790\nAnd so we can do that.\n\n33\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.520\nEach slice can be different.\n\n34\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.100\nSo, I have a document ready\nto go to demonstrate this.\n\n35\n00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.870\nAnd I've got a few notes here.\n\n36\n00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.375\nAnd this is a beautiful\nwebsite mock up isn't it?\n\n37\n00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.617\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is lovely.\n\n38\n00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:09.153\n>> Yeah.\n\n39\n00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:15.610\nSo, for demonstration purposes, so\nI threw in some raster information.\n\n40\n00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.970\nI put a picture in there, I put some\nvector and I put some text in here.\n\n41\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.550\nSo like I was saying, you can divide it\nand export it out at different settings.\n\n42\n00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.440\nYou have a Slice tool that\nyou can actually create,\n\n43\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.240\njust like you're slicing up a pizza,\nright?\n\n44\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.190\nI wanna go ahead and\ncreate those areas that I want to become\n\n45\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.896\ntheir own exported file.\n\n46\n00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:39.860\nAnd then you also have a Selection tool.\n\n47\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.910\nThat is a Slice selection tool,\nnot the black arrow,\n\n48\n00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.270\nbecause the black arrow is going to be\nselecting the actual art work on the page.\n\n49\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.670\nSo that's reserved for the items.\n\n50\n00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.310\nThe Slice selection is\nreserved to select slices.\n\n51\n00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.138\nYou do have a view menu to where\nyou can show and hide your slices.\n\n52\n00:02:57.138 --> 00:03:01.734\nAnd there's some things that you can\ndo in the object menu from the slice\n\n53\n00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:03.429\noption that will go over.\n\n54\n00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.794\nAnd then of course when you\nget into the safer web,\n\n55\n00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:11.778\nunderstanding what slices you're\nchoosing in and some of the export or.\n\n56\n00:03:11.778 --> 00:03:14.899\nI keep saying export options because\nyou really are exporting but\n\n57\n00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.699\nthe safer web options are in there and\nthere's a few extra things that we didn't\n\n58\n00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.870\ncover in the last episode cuz\nwe didn't have any slices.\n\n59\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.770\nSo we'll start here.\n\n60\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.150\nI will get my Slice tool right over here.\n\n61\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.850\nThere's my Slice tool, and I want it.\n\n62\n00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.800\nAnd I want to say that this logo,\n\n63\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.800\nthat needs to come out\nas its own end file.\n\n64\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.830\nSo I'm just gonna click,\nhold, and drag, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.290\nSlices only create rectangles.\n\n66\n00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.800\nSo if I let go, you see that\nto actually create that slice.\n\n67\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.390\nIt has to create the other\ntable if you want to say.\n\n68\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.340\nThe other rows and\n\n69\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.460\ncolumns of how it needs to understand\nthis is the area where I went.\n\n70\n00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.560\nAnd so you can see that I defined,\nthis is a user defined slice.\n\n71\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.369\nI defined this area but how it can create\nthis they created non user defined slices.\n\n72\n00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:10.595\nIt's like the automatic slices,\n\n73\n00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:15.310\nit had to be created because\neverything's based on this table.\n\n74\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.905\nThis actually goes back to, back to day\nwith the image maps and like image quilts.\n\n75\n00:04:20.905 --> 00:04:24.965\nWay, way back in the day in web design\nwhere it looked like one image,\n\n76\n00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:29.095\nbut to load quickly, you would actually\nslice it into individual pieces.\n\n77\n00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:29.725\n>> Yes, I remember that.\n\n78\n00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:30.245\n>> Do you remember that?\n\n79\n00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:31.038\n>> Yeah, that was a long time ago.\n\n80\n00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:31.546\nYeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:32.110\n[LAUGH] So it\n\n82\n00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.340\nwould go ahead and create that.\n\n83\n00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.050\nSo it has to understand\nthis is a table and\n\n84\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.450\nthis is where it has to show\nthe quadrants of each slice.\n\n85\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.060\nIt's still in existence and\nits still a valid web technic.\n\n86\n00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.784\nNow with speeds and everything you\ndon't necessarily have to do that.\n\n87\n00:04:49.784 --> 00:04:54.020\nBut the same idea of creating\nan image map of clickable regions,\n\n88\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.420\nit's like the same but different,\nso it has two separate topics.\n\n89\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.480\n>> Right, right. [LAUGH] >> But for\nthis example we're talking about slices,\n\n90\n00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.620\nit creates that grid.\n\n91\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.120\nAll right, and that's, there you go.\n\n92\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.780\nI've made my user-defined slice.\n\n93\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.870\nMaybe I want to slice out this for\nsome reason.\n\n94\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.200\nAll right.\nNow watch when I make this.\n\n95\n00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.070\nThat other line was there so okay now\nto make that kind of merge my cells and\n\n96\n00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.685\nall that kind of fun.\n\n97\n00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:21.965\nTerminology, there's my\nother user defined slice.\n\n98\n00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:24.155\nAnd I can go ahead and\nkeep on slicing over here.\n\n99\n00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:29.989\nI can use that as not very accurate, but\nI kinda did that on purpose [LAUGH].\n\n100\n00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:32.172\nAnd I can go ahead and make them here.\n\n101\n00:05:32.172 --> 00:05:36.470\nThey're little all over the place but\nthen I can modify it.\n\n102\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.930\nSo you just go ahead and slice it on up.\n\n103\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.780\nBut I did wanna show you that you can\ncreate slices from that object menu.\n\n104\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.000\nSo I'm gonna go back to that\nBlack Arrow tool because.\n\n105\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.020\nI want this picture.\n\n106\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.060\nI've selected this image.\n\n107\n00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.780\nI want that to become a slice,\nslice around it,\n\n108\n00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.320\nbut maybe I'm not going to get it exactly\nright on the edge of the picture.\n\n109\n00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.020\nWell you can define the slices from\nthe selected item, which is pretty neat.\n\n110\n00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.500\nAnd it's gonna go exactly\nwhere it needs to go.\n\n111\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.890\nSo, I'm gonna go to Object,\nI'm gonna go to Slice, here you are.\n\n112\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.850\nAnd I'm gonna go to Make.\n\n113\n00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.160\nAnd if I go ahead and Make, there it goes.\n\n114\n00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.090\nIt makes the Slice based on\na selection of the item that I had.\n\n115\n00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.650\nSo, pretty good!\n\n116\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.720\nI need, these are all a little off and\n\n117\n00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.470\nI wanna make sure that\nthey're all the right size.\n\n118\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.410\nSo, this is where I would go over to the\nSlice Selection tool, so I can change it.\n\n119\n00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.940\nSo I'm gonna zoom in a little bit here and\nI'm going to take this slice and\n\n120\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.300\nmaybe move it up, and I could go\nthrough and change the actual width and\n\n121\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.510\nheight of those slices like to make it, if\nI know I needed to be 100 x 100, and then.\n\n122\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.260\nAnd it's exported option\nI could go ahead and\n\n123\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.670\ntype that in and\nactually that might be a little small.\n\n124\n00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.600\nBut you can see that I could go ahead and\n\n125\n00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.060\nmove this slice over and\ngo, it's just about right.\n\n126\n00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.910\nSo I can get it just the way I\nwant it to be and go from there.\n\n127\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.760\nSo you can change it from the transform\nmenu and change the width and\n\n128\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.730\nheight to get to the exact\nmeasurement that you want it to be.\n\n129\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.030\nUp in here I'm just kind of eyeballing,\nI'm just like that sounds good.\n\n130\n00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.170\nNow if I didn't want that I can go ahead,\nsorry, I can select it,\n\n131\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.685\nbecause I've got this as the right size.\n\n132\n00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:21.420\nThat's perfect, maybe I'm using my\narrow keys to nudge it down or over.\n\n133\n00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.032\nThat's good.\n\n134\n00:07:22.032 --> 00:07:23.660\nI want the other ones to be that way.\n\n135\n00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.350\nI could change each ones\nof these individually,\n\n136\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.660\nbut why don't I just go ahead and\ndelete those other two slices.\n\n137\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.050\nTake this guy and then just go ahead and\nalt-drag just like I would any other item.\n\n138\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.390\nAnd then just alt-drag that slice.\n\n139\n00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.030\n>> Very cool.\n\n140\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.000\n>> Yeah, because I'm in\nthe Slice Selection tool, so\n\n141\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.010\nI'm selecting my slices and\ndoing the same thing.\n\n142\n00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.010\nI'm changing the size.\n\n143\n00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.910\nOops, I had both of them selected, sorry.\n\n144\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.010\nSo I have that one then I'll\nalt-drag let's try that again.\n\n145\n00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.450\nAnd then I can alt-drag over\nhere to put it around the three.\n\n146\n00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.740\nThen we move it around and\nI can again put those x and\n\n147\n00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.000\ny coordinates exactly pin pointing\nto where I want it to go.\n\n148\n00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.600\nBut right now I'm just eye balling\nthat's pretty close, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.190\nSo you can see you could change all of the\ndifferent areas, maybe I wanna make this\n\n150\n00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:11.340\na little smaller, make this move over,\nand you modify the slices from there.\n\n151\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.110\nWith the slice Selection tool,\nif I didn't do anything else from here,\n\n152\n00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.750\nI could be done.\n\n153\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.550\nBut just like when we were exporting\nmultiple art boards in the export episode.\n\n154\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.230\nYou could export them all, and\nit would use the name of the art board.\n\n155\n00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.260\nRemember that?\n\n156\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.650\nI asked you that question.\n\n157\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.435\n>> Yes.\n>> And you answered it correctly.\n\n158\n00:08:33.435 --> 00:08:35.616\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can do the same thing here with\n\n159\n00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:38.818\nyour slices, cuz by default,\nif I export all this out.\n\n160\n00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:43.520\nAll the names are just going\nto be like 01, 05, 07, 010, or\n\n161\n00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.466\nwhatever it thinks that it's the cell\nalong it's dividing of this grid,\n\n162\n00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:50.570\nif you wanna say, this table.\n\n163\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.856\nAnd then you can go and you can always\nrename it because that's what I would\n\n164\n00:08:53.856 --> 00:08:57.420\nusually do, is just rename it, because\nthis does take a little bit of time.\n\n165\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:03.380\nBut again, if you plan ahead and get them\nin the right format if you wanna say.\n\n166\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.500\nIt can lessen your time modifying\nafterwards, that can save.\n\n167\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.340\nSo I'm going to have a slice selected I'm\ngonna go to Object and then I go to Slice,\n\n168\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.050\nand then I'm going to go to Slice Options.\n\n169\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.700\nAnd here is where you,\nthere it is, see user 06.\n\n170\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.957\nThat's what it's default name\nwould be when I export it out.\n\n171\n00:09:23.957 --> 00:09:27.793\nAnd I'm not going to name every single one\nof them so I can have some compare and\n\n172\n00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:31.750\ncontrast, but I could actually\nname this slice as a flower.\n\n173\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.690\nAnd you could also change\nthe type of slice that you want.\n\n174\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:41.450\nNow this starts to get into where\nyou do have a lot of options for\n\n175\n00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.680\ncreating HTML, or\n\n176\n00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.490\nprepping your HTML items, or web-based\nitems for HTML when you get there.\n\n177\n00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.630\nSometimes it doesn't always\ngive me exactly what I want.\n\n178\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.850\nI'm not saying it doesn't work.\n\n179\n00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:00.160\nIts just that for me I want to go have and\ncontrol all of that through\n\n180\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.630\nmy other programs whether it'd\nbe Dreamweaver or my own coding.\n\n181\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.750\nI just need the image.\n\n182\n00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.070\nThat's really all I need.\n\n183\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.980\nI don't need you to do anymore than that.\n\n184\n00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.490\nBut you would have that option,\nyou can see you have like an Alt tag,\n\n185\n00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.260\nyou can go ahead and add that in.\n\n186\n00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.030\nAnd it usually will go ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.360\nassociate itself with\nthe meta-properties of the file.\n\n188\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.144\nSo, I'm just going to go with name in\nthis example and I'm going to click okay.\n\n189\n00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:27.366\nAnd again you can go through each slice\nand name each one of them to go ahead and\n\n190\n00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:31.690\nget it prepped for\nwhen you're ready to move it out.\n\n191\n00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.790\nWhich now we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n192\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.260\nOkay.\nI'm going to go to file, save for web.\n\n193\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.170\nNow when I go to file save for web I'm\nusing the control zero to go ahead and\n\n194\n00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.190\nzoom out to fit the screen.\n\n195\n00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.680\nIt sees all of this.\n\n196\n00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.960\nAll right and I can and it automatically\nhas a Slice Select tool here like on.\n\n197\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.450\nSo I can pick different slices, you can\nsee it's kinda putting like the orange\n\n198\n00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:04.390\nbox around,\nthis is the active slice that I have on.\n\n199\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:09.590\nBecause maybe this Lucky's Orchard,\nright now it's set at JPEG, right?\n\n200\n00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.000\nWell I don't want that to be a JPEG,\nI want that to be a PNG.\n\n201\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.330\nI want it to be a PNG with transparency.\n\n202\n00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.900\nSo if you notice just this\nslice that I have selected,\n\n203\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.910\nI can make that P&G 24 cool so\nthat's gonna be transparent.\n\n204\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.010\nMaybe I want this guy right here and\nmaybe I want all three of these.\n\n205\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.510\nSo you can use your shift click\nto select multiple slices and\n\n206\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.390\nI can shift click and I've got the little\norange boxes around each three of them.\n\n207\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.180\nAll three of those need\nto be a pink you know?\n\n208\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.650\nAnd maybe this, since it's flat color.\n\n209\n00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.440\nMaybe a PNG 24.\n\n210\n00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.530\nMaybe I actually want that to be a PNG\n28 because there's not a lot of color.\n\n211\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.580\nThere's very flat colors,\n\n212\n00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.820\nso I don't need that huge color\nsupport that a PNG 24 gives me.\n\n213\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.500\nI can go with an eight and be fine.\n\n214\n00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.070\nAnd the other thing that I\nshould probably go ahead and\n\n215\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:01.870\npoint out to you is that you can see\nin the slices down here at the bottom.\n\n216\n00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.020\nIt's actually going to give\nyou like the final file size.\n\n217\n00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.892\nYou can actually watch that\noptimizing with those different files\n\n218\n00:12:09.892 --> 00:12:14.765\nof different file types of what your\nfinal file size is going to be.\n\n219\n00:12:14.765 --> 00:12:17.750\nOkay, if I took this guy.\n\n220\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.570\nThis is a PNG.\n\n221\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.870\nThis is a 6K.\n\n222\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.300\nThat's super, super small.\n\n223\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.590\nBut if I change it to a PNG 8\nit's actually going to a 3k.\n\n224\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:32.475\nSo the less Information\nyou want it to keep.\n\n225\n00:12:32.475 --> 00:12:33.379\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n226\n00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:36.220\n>> The lower the file size.\n\n227\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.030\nAgain the whole idea of what\nit means to be optimized.\n\n228\n00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.450\nBy I am going to keep that as a PNG 24.\n\n229\n00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:47.440\nI'm gonna come over here,\nthis would be a JPEG and this is text so.\n\n230\n00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.870\nI'll just keep it as a JPEG as well.\n\n231\n00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.540\nBut anyway, it's the whole idea of each\nslice can be optimized to a different\n\n232\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.460\nsetting that you want it to\nthen become when you're done.\n\n233\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.510\nOkay, so I've got, I made these PNGs,\nI'm gonna make these GIF.\n\n234\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.800\nSorry, I'm just getting for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n235\n00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.600\nSo, I've got JPEGs, Pings, GIFs.\n\n236\n00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.100\nPerfect.\n\n237\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.270\nIf I wasn't paying attention or\ndidn't know about this option,\n\n238\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.670\nit's actually probably behind my head.\n\n239\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.650\nAnd so down here,\nyou can see that it says, export.\n\n240\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.910\nExport what?\n\n241\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.698\nAll slices.\n\n242\n00:13:20.698 --> 00:13:25.180\nOkay, so again if I wasn't paying\nattention, I wouldn't understand\n\n243\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.070\nnecessarily like why I'm getting all these\nextra boxes that's going to come up.\n\n244\n00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.290\nI'm gonna keep that on just so\nyou can see that really quickly.\n\n245\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.600\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay yep, I want to save.\n\n246\n00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.125\nAnd I'm going to put this on the x.\n\n247\n00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:39.703\nAnd I'll keep the name for\n\n248\n00:13:39.703 --> 00:13:43.590\nnow to show you what it's actually\ngoing to do once we're done.\n\n249\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.460\nNow I click Save, there it goes.\n\n250\n00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.650\nNow let me go ahead and\nswitch over to here.\n\n251\n00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.390\nYou'll always get an images folder.\n\n252\n00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:57.310\nKeep that in mind because the next time\nwhen we go back and do it again if\n\n253\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:02.560\nI didn't make like a new folder it's gonna\nkeep going into that same images folder.\n\n254\n00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.870\n>> Overriding what's there or\njust adding to what's there?\n\n255\n00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.120\n>> Adding.\n\n256\n00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.020\nSo if I come into images like great\nwell there's my JPEG, there's my PNG,\n\n257\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.280\nthere's my GIF, but all these other\nslices are coming along with it.\n\n258\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.940\n>> The system generated slices\nto Fill out that page or\n\n259\n00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.570\nthat table were included\nwhen you said all slices.\n\n260\n00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.280\n>> Exactly.\n\n261\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.490\nAnd in here is this the worst?\n\n262\n00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.730\nNo, I could go ahead and\nselect all of these guys and\n\n263\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.040\njust delete them and\n>> Tedious.\n\n264\n00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.870\n>> Be fine.\nYeah, but more steps than I needed, okay.\n\n265\n00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.590\nSo I'm gonna come back over, and\nsee the name to the flower, and\n\n266\n00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.230\nthe other ones just have the numbers so\nthat came over.\n\n267\n00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.520\nSo, I'm back to here.\n\n268\n00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.430\nThen I go to file, and\nthen I go to save as, save for web.\n\n269\n00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:50.290\nIf I go to save for web,\nhere is where I if I wanted every single\n\n270\n00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.045\nuser defined slice to be exported\ndown here by my head again.\n\n271\n00:14:55.045 --> 00:14:59.140\nWe can see that,\nI can change that to User Slices.\n\n272\n00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:04.540\nOkay, so I want that one and that would\ngive me all the ones that I created.\n\n273\n00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.530\nNow, there's an other option here,\nwhere it says Selected Slices.\n\n274\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:14.170\nCuz maybe I've got this but I just need\nthe logo and the flower for some reason.\n\n275\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.922\nI can go ahead and shift click these\ntwo and now the ones that I have\n\n276\n00:15:18.922 --> 00:15:24.222\nselected will be the ones when I\nchoose the option for Selected Slices.\n\n277\n00:15:24.222 --> 00:15:27.420\nThat will be the only ones that come out.\n\n278\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.516\nSo, that little drop down,\nit's very small and it's very important.\n\n279\n00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:35.018\nThat's where I've messed\nthat quite a few times,\n\n280\n00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:38.465\nand it was really by trial and\nerror, that's what that means!\n\n281\n00:15:38.465 --> 00:15:40.778\nBecause I was just deleting\nall the extra files.\n\n282\n00:15:40.778 --> 00:15:42.700\n[LAUGHS] Yeah, so.\n\n283\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:47.900\nI'll go with User-defined Slices,\nand then I'll go ahead and save.\n\n284\n00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.280\nAnd it will try to do another images,\nso I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n285\n00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:57.310\ndo slice start 2 so we can see that.\n\n286\n00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.630\nIt was telling me that yes,\n\n287\n00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.300\nit will replace that one\nbecause it was the same name.\n\n288\n00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.460\n>> Flower, flower, yes.\n\n289\n00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.580\n>> Yes, cuz those were, I gave it\na specific name to that slice but\n\n290\n00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.450\nthe rest of them You can see there.\n\n291\n00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.145\nSee slice start 2?\n\n292\n00:16:10.145 --> 00:16:10.790\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n293\n00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:16.380\n>> Okay, so if I hadn't have\nrenamed that default file name\n\n294\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.810\nit would say did you want to\nreplace those other ones?\n\n295\n00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:23.620\nBecause it does say that it's still\nthe slice 18, this is slice 18,\n\n296\n00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.700\nthis is slice 14.\n\n297\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.770\nSo I changed that name just to show you\nthat it didn't make a new images folder,\n\n298\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.110\nit's like, you told me to go to export,\n\n299\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.700\nthere's an images folder,\nI'm just gonna put it in there.\n\n300\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.370\nSo if you're trying to keep\nit separate either rename or\n\n301\n00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.340\nmake a new folder, like a new root\nfolder as it's called in web stuff\n\n302\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.150\nof where the images folder is gonna go.\n\n303\n00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.300\nSo it's just something to keep in mind and\n\n304\n00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.260\njust another example,\nthis is something I've done.\n\n305\n00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.340\nWhoa!\n\n306\n00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.760\nI had something that I\nwas making 16 modules and\n\n307\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.330\nI needed to have buttons or images\nthat indicated which one we were on so\n\n308\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:05.020\nI just went through this and just named\nthem all or just sliced, created them.\n\n309\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.030\nI actually did the whole\nslice from selection.\n\n310\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.110\nI made little boxes and\nmade all the selections.\n\n311\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:15.205\nSo that way, if I wanted to come into\nhere, I keep wanting to go to export.\n\n312\n00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:21.120\n[LAUGH] Save for web,\nit's kind of freaking out a little bit.\n\n313\n00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.640\nThis is where I could then go ahead and\nI just click hold and drag and\n\n314\n00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.700\nI select all of these slices.\n\n315\n00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.610\nI only want the ones that I have selected.\n\n316\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:35.590\nTo go ahead and come out and then I could\nname it green and go from there, and you\n\n317\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:41.555\ncan see that all those particular buttons\ncame out as green and then the number.\n\n318\n00:17:41.555 --> 00:17:44.019\nSo if I was,\nthat's a lot of slices to name so\n\n319\n00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:48.305\nI just went ahead an kept them as like,\nyou know what, that's good enough.\n\n320\n00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:48.909\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n321\n00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:51.729\n>> Not very good for\nmy alt text to because that's.\n\n322\n00:17:51.729 --> 00:17:53.993\n>> Right.\n>> That get's into a whole other subject\n\n323\n00:17:53.993 --> 00:17:58.787\nof making sure that the file names match\nyour file of what it actually means in\n\n324\n00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:03.227\nyour ADA compatibility, and\nmaking sure that it's adequately named.\n\n325\n00:18:03.227 --> 00:18:08.327\nBut at least you know how to work it,\nand that covers slicing for\n\n326\n00:18:08.327 --> 00:18:09.737\nweb using Illustrator.\n\n327\n00:18:09.737 --> 00:18:13.393\nI love it, I use this a lot cuz\nI do a lot of web graphics, and\n\n328\n00:18:13.393 --> 00:18:16.029\neven sometimes I'll have the same logo.\n\n329\n00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:20.637\nRemember cuz we did the different export\noptions with the art boards, I've actually\n\n330\n00:18:20.637 --> 00:18:25.117\ntaken, made a logo, alt-dragged and made\nlike four copies of it and then sliced it\n\n331\n00:18:25.117 --> 00:18:29.360\nand choose like that one's a JPEG,\nthat one's a GIF, that one's a PNG.\n\n332\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.500\nAnd then change the file size\nin the safe for web options.\n\n333\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:37.480\nSo, I've done that option as well so\nit can be used for a lot of awesome stuff.\n\n334\n00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.570\n>> Very, very cool.\n\n335\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.560\nNow we know how we can slice\nour Illustrator file up\n\n336\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.855\njust like we would a pizza.\n\n337\n00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:43.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We thank you for\n\n338\n00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.530\nthese great demonstrations,
