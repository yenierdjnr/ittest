00:00:17.847\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:20.620\ntoday we're gonna be going\nover Adobe Illustrator CC.\n\n5\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.760\nOne of many programs available Within\nthe good old Creative Cloud suite.\n\n6\n00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.920\nAnd here to help us tell us all\nabout the program, what we can do,\n\n7\n00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.050\nand how to use it, is Ms.\nVonne Smith, how's it going Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.450\n>> Good, I'm so excited to be\nhere to talk about Illustrator\n\n9\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.050\nwhich is one of my favorite programs.\n\n10\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.010\nIt actually truly is one of my favorite\nprograms, I use it constantly.\n\n11\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.610\nAnd, it's awesome so I'm really glad\nto be able to share this all with you.\n\n12\n00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.570\nFirst of all, what is Illustrator?\n\n13\n00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.800\nIllustrator is the vector editing\nprogram within the creative suite.\n\n14\n00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.255\nIt is It is used to edit vector artwork,\n\n15\n00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.295\ncreate vector artwork, everything\nvectors is what you use Illustrator for.\n\n16\n00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:05.875\nSo, what is a vector?\n\n17\n00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:09.105\n>> That was my next question,\nVonne, what the heck is a vector?\n\n18\n00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:12.840\n>> Exactly, so,\nwhen you hear the word vector,\n\n19\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.700\nyou actually think of math which\nusually starts to scare people.\n\n20\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.220\nYou know, [LAUGH] I don't wanna\ndo addition or subtraction or\n\n21\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.270\nany of that kind of stuff.\n\n22\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.642\nSo, it's actually more like geometry.\n\n23\n00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:23.776\nDo you remember geometry?\n\n24\n00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:24.670\n>> Way back when.\n\n25\n00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.278\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:26.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're going a little back on that one.\n\n27\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.590\nBut, that was actually one of my\nfavorite math classes because it was\n\n28\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.423\nmore spatial and it was drawing shapes.\n\n29\n00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:38.980\nRemember drawing the isosceles\ntriangle is that one right there?\n\n30\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.850\n>> That is an equal something triangle.\n\n31\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.763\n>> We'll go with that yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:44.902\n[LAUGH] We'll go equilateral.\n\n33\n00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:46.123\n>> I told you-\n>> I think that's what it was.\n\n34\n00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:47.710\n>> It's been a long time\nsince I did geometry.\n\n35\n00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.254\n>> Exactly so we'll go with that so\n\n36\n00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:52.067\nthe equal sides I think that's\nan equilateral triangle.\n\n37\n00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:52.764\nAll right, wonderful.\n\n38\n00:01:52.764 --> 00:01:54.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n39\n00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.520\nthat's basically what you're creating\nwhen you're creating Illustrator.\n\n40\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.380\nYou're creating shapes,\nyou're creating lines and curves and arcs.\n\n41\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.680\nAnd the word that you always use\nwith vectors is the word path,\n\n42\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.740\nwe're creating vector paths in\nIllustrator, and those path have points\n\n43\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.110\nalong the way and you can have open paths,\nclose paths, all things like that.\n\n44\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.560\nWhen you're working with shapes,\nyou have insides and outsides.\n\n45\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.520\nLike if I'm looking at this triangle,\nI would say that it has a blue inside and\n\n46\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.010\na darker blue outside.\n\n47\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.307\nThe technical term is fills and strokes,\nyou have the insides and the outsides.\n\n48\n00:02:34.307 --> 00:02:41.270\nSo that's what you use when you're talking\nabout vector graphics within Illustrator.\n\n49\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.130\n>> Okay.\n\n50\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.030\n>> The cool thing about\nvector graphics is that\n\n51\n00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.920\nyou don't have any resolution like\nyou have with raster graphics\n\n52\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.690\nwhich we'll talk a little more in\nthe next slide about the differences.\n\n53\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.620\nSo you use vectors to\nwhere you can scale up.\n\n54\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.800\nActually, let's move on\nto vectors vs raster.\n\n55\n00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.240\nWhen I say the word raster,\nyou're thinking of an actual picture.\n\n56\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.830\nLike a picture of a cat, or a bunny,\nor anything to that effect.\n\n57\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.840\nIt is made up of pixels and when you have\npixels you are resolution dependent.\n\n58\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.575\nIt depends on the resolution of\nwhatever space you’re going into.\n\n59\n00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.800\nWhen I mean space I'm talking about\nwhether you’re working in web or\n\n60\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.350\nyour working in print and that depends.\n\n61\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.970\nAnd have you ever taken a picture, like\noff the Internet or off your camera and\n\n62\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.360\nthen you put it somewhere else and you\ntry to make it bigger and it does what?\n\n63\n00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.280\n>> And it gets all grainy and\nit just loses detail, it gets horrible.\n\n64\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.780\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you try to go too big if\n\n65\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.980\nit starts out too small.\n\n66\n00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.010\n>> Exactly, yes so that's the whole\nthing about raster graphics\n\n67\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.780\nis that you have that resolution and\nthat total number of pixels\n\n68\n00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.710\nthat occupy that space\nof that photograph file.\n\n69\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.510\nThat's all you got for the most part, and\n\n70\n00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.580\nwe use Photoshop to edit\nthose raster graphics.\n\n71\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.660\nIllustrator is used to edit\nthe vector graphics, and\n\n72\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.940\nI have some of those kind of\ncommon file formats on this slide.\n\n73\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.485\nJPG, do these all look\nsomewhat familiar to you?\n\n74\n00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:13.217\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n>> I'm sure JPG is probably one that-\n\n75\n00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:13.720\n>> JPG, GIF, TIFF, yeah.\n\n76\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.500\n>> Everybody probably, now with\ntheir mobile phones and everything,\n\n77\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.230\nyou've got your jpgs, your gifs,\nyour tiffs, your pngs and your bmps.\n\n78\n00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.750\nSo those are all raster graphic formats.\n\n79\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.650\nIllustrator, you have the eps file,\nwhich is an encapsulated postscript file.\n\n80\n00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.306\nThat is probably the most famous,\nif you want to say,\n\n81\n00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:38.870\nof the vector-capable,\nor vector-compatible.\n\n82\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.410\nIt can hold vector information,\nbasically, is the EPS file.\n\n83\n00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.260\nThere's another file format when you're\ntalking about vectors, is the SVG,\n\n84\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.540\nit's a scalable vector graphic.\n\n85\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.610\nAnd also pdf, usually when you're\nthinking of pdfs, you're thinking, right.\n\n86\n00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.710\n>> It makes sense now though,\nbecause I know that I can take a PDF and\n\n87\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.820\nI can scale it up and\nI don't lose the detail.\n\n88\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.638\nNow I know why,\nbecause it's a raster graphic.\n\n89\n00:05:01.638 --> 00:05:02.774\n>> Other one.\n\n90\n00:05:02.774 --> 00:05:03.866\n>> Is it sort of, sorry,\nis it a vector graphic.\n\n91\n00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:05.278\n>> [LAUGH] A vector graphic, yeah.\n\n92\n00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:08.460\nYeah, actually a PDF, a lot of times\nwhen people think of PDFs, its like,\n\n93\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.830\nI'm sending you a file like a Word file or\na contract or something to that effect.\n\n94\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.360\nSo I think people usually equate\nPDFs with text documents.\n\n95\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.840\nBut the PDF file format can actually\nhold a whole bunch of information and\n\n96\n00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.160\nit can support vector graphics.\n\n97\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.100\nSo depending on what is actually in\nthat PDF that you're talking about,\n\n98\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.670\nit could scale but that file format\ncan also hold raster information so\n\n99\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.450\nit does have it's kinda\nlike a both type of thing.\n\n100\n00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.540\nBut on the other side, like a JPEG file,\n\n101\n00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.600\nthat doesn't support vectors like you\ncan not have any vector information\n\n102\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.980\nin that file format, as along with any\nof those other raster file formats.\n\n103\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.430\nThe vector files formats\ncan support vectors.\n\n104\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.510\n>> Good.\n>> That's how it works.\n\n105\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.520\n>> Nice.\n>> All right.\n\n106\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.420\nWonderful.\n\n107\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.440\nSo, I wanted to talk a little bit about\nsome of the other products that are in\n\n108\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.580\nthe Adobe Suite,\nbecause these three products\n\n109\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.820\nto me are the trifecta of everything for\ngraphic design.\n\n110\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.365\nThere's others in the creative suite.\n\n111\n00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:16.680\nBut these to me are like the big guys\nwhen you're talking about actual\n\n112\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.510\ngraphic design,\nI think I just said that twice.\n\n113\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.444\nOkay, so you have Photoshop right,\nI think we had mentioned that before.\n\n114\n00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:26.797\nThat is your raster editing program,\nyou take your files or\n\n115\n00:06:26.797 --> 00:06:30.953\nyou take your photographs, you edit,\nyou put the mustache on your cat and\n\n116\n00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:32.310\neverything like that.\n\n117\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.690\nYou put the bunny ears on your friends and\nyou swap faces or whatever you're doing.\n\n118\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.650\nAnd so you edit those in Photoshop.\n\n119\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.290\nThen you can take any type of\nraster images that you create\n\n120\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.070\nin Photoshop and you can use them as\n\n121\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.250\nthose images within your different\npublications that you might create.\n\n122\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.200\nOkay so then on the other side we\nhave InDesign versus Illustrator.\n\n123\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.230\nWell, you can see in this kinda list down\nthere that I have flyers and business\n\n124\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.300\ncards under Illustrator, but I also have\nflyers and business cards under InDesign.\n\n125\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.870\nSo, this is kinda the age old, well,\nwhich one do I use when I'm doing that?\n\n126\n00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.210\nI've actually used both, but it really\njust depends on what you need out of that\n\n127\n00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.290\nparticular publication\nthat you're creating.\n\n128\n00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.370\nAnd this could be either for print or web.\n\n129\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.330\nIt's just like, which one am I designing?\n\n130\n00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.970\nAnd so you can see that here we have\nIllustrator is really great for\n\n131\n00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.990\nsingle page layout.\n\n132\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.500\nYou don't really do multi-page\nlayouts within Illustrator.\n\n133\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.290\nIt just doesn't work that way.\n\n134\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.890\nIt doesn't have those capabilities.\n\n135\n00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.420\nInDesign is definitely for\nmulti-page layouts.\n\n136\n00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.350\nYou wanna do a four page brochure?\n\n137\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.570\nGo with InDesign.\n\n138\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.100\nIf you're talking about a single page,\nit's really depending on what you need.\n\n139\n00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.340\nIf you're going for lots of text,\nvery text heavy documents,\n\n140\n00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.420\nI would lean towards InDesign because\nInDesign has a lot more capabilities with\n\n141\n00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.140\nhow you can style text with style.\n\n142\n00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.040\nIllustrator has styles but\nit just doesn't work as well.\n\n143\n00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.000\nAnd I would not create a logo in InDesign.\n\n144\n00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.570\nI would create it in Illustrator because\nIllustrator has a lot more what I call\n\n145\n00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.070\ncrayons.\n\n146\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.120\nIt's got a lot more things\nthat you can play around with.\n\n147\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.690\nAnd it's just got really great stuff.\n\n148\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.190\nInDesign, page layout, text heavy.\n\n149\n00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:33.105\nIllustrator, more creative, more crayons,\nmore things you can do with it.\n\n150\n00:08:33.105 --> 00:08:38.570\nAnother factor that would always determine\nto me whether I would use InDesign\n\n151\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.160\nversus Illustrator was\nthe package function.\n\n152\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.080\nNow that's kind of old school now,\nbecause package is actually\n\n153\n00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.800\nin Illustrator starting in version CC6 and\nabove, like, what is package?\n\n154\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.070\nWhen you think of a package,\nwhat do you think about?\n\n155\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.060\nWhat's a package?\n\n156\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.090\n>> A Christmas present.\n\n157\n00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.230\n>> A Christmas present, right?\n\n158\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.430\nSo, you have all the goodies\ninside the present and\n\n159\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.940\nyou can take it around and move it.\n\n160\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.730\nThat's exactly what package\nmeans within these two products\n\n161\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.030\nbecause if you think about a flyer,\nyou're going to have some pictures,\n\n162\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.230\nyou're going to have some logos,\nyou're going to have some text.\n\n163\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.930\nSo you're going to be using files\nfrom other places if you wanna say\n\n164\n00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.610\nwithin your computer and so,\nif you're ready to transport that.\n\n165\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.040\nLet's say send it to a printer or\n\n166\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.790\nI'm sending it to you because you're\ngoing to take over editing my brochure or\n\n167\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.240\nsomething like that, you need everything\nthat comes along with that publication.\n\n168\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.900\nAnd I might have put it on one hard drive,\nand one folder here, one folder there.\n\n169\n00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.970\nPackage basically packages it all together\nin a nice little package, in a folder.\n\n170\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.040\nAnd that way that folder\nbecomes the single unit\n\n171\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.390\nof all of the elements that I need for\nthat design.\n\n172\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.020\nSo it's really great.\n\n173\n00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.260\n>> Makes it portable almost.\n\n174\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.190\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n175\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.380\nAnd so that was a huge determination for\n\n176\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.940\nme of which product that I\nwas used back in the day.\n\n177\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.738\nNow you got it in Illustrator and\nit's super great.\n\n178\n00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:05.784\nAll right,\nwhat do I have on my next slide?\n\n179\n00:10:05.784 --> 00:10:06.730\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n180\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.688\n>> I actually forgot what I was\n\n181\n00:10:07.688 --> 00:10:08.192\ndoing there.\n\n182\n00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:13.070\nAll right, so another important thing\nto know about when you're working\n\n183\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.870\nwith Illustrator is what version of\nIllustrator, well, do you have for\n\n184\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.797\none thing, and how that relates to others.\n\n185\n00:10:20.797 --> 00:10:25.460\nIf I have Adobe CC and you have Adobe Cs5.\n\n186\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.540\nI create this awesome logo and\nyou're like can you send me that logo,\n\n187\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.020\nbecause I wanna put it in our magazine or\nsomething like that.\n\n188\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.606\nSo I send it to you,\nyou won't be able to open it.\n\n189\n00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:41.283\nSo old does not open new, okay, but\n\n190\n00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:46.431\nnew can open old like if you\nsent me the logo that you\n\n191\n00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:51.231\ncreated in CS5, me in CS6, no what I'm in?\n\n192\n00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:52.200\nCS, CC.\n>> Creative Cloud?\n\n193\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.470\n>> That's what we're in.\n\n194\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.300\nIf I'm in CC I can open that file format.\n\n195\n00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.913\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay so\n\n196\n00:10:56.913 --> 00:11:00.991\nit is something that you always need\nto be aware of as a designer or\n\n197\n00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:05.085\nin creating anything in Illustrator\nis who else needs to use it.\n\n198\n00:11:05.085 --> 00:11:10.240\nSo it's always also better to stay\nin the native version that you have.\n\n199\n00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.000\nSo, if you create the logo in CC,\n\n200\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.910\nyou should keep editing it in CC,\nif at all possible.\n\n201\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.520\nThe reason I say that is because,\nwhen you go down\n\n202\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.150\nto lower versions of Illustrator,\nyou can lose some functionality, because,\n\n203\n00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.652\nof course, the evolution of the product,\nthey've added a lot more crayons.\n\n204\n00:11:29.652 --> 00:11:32.450\nThey've added a lot more tools,\na lot more functionality.\n\n205\n00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.610\nAnd so those newer versions support\nall these great new things.\n\n206\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.810\nThe older versions don't\nsupport all of that.\n\n207\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:44.601\nSo you could lose some of that formatting,\nI guess you could say, and even more than\n\n208\n00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:50.595\nthat, you wouldn't be able to edit those\nthings in an older version of Illustrator.\n\n209\n00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:54.543\nBut one thing I can do in\nnewer versions of Illustrator,\n\n210\n00:11:54.543 --> 00:12:00.110\nsuch as Adobe Illustrator CC, is I can\nsave down in compatibility for you.\n\n211\n00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.390\n>> So if you knew somebody had\nan older version of the program,\n\n212\n00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.510\nyou could save it as an older version\nthat they could then work with and edit.\n\n213\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.020\n>> Correct, yeah I was,\nI would actually take and do a Save As and\n\n214\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.150\nsave it as an Illustrator CS,\nwhat do we say you're on five?\n\n215\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.435\n>> Five.\n>> You're on five, okay so\n\n216\n00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.230\nI would save it as an Illustrator 5.\n\n217\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.710\nIt's still gonna show up\nto you as an AI file.\n\n218\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.380\nI see it as an AI file,\nyou see it as an AI file.\n\n219\n00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.740\nSo the file format doesn't change.\n\n220\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.590\nIt's just the compatibility\nof who can actually open it.\n\n221\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:30.850\nIt's not like the DOC,\n\n222\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.850\nDOCX thing that you have in-\n>> Like Office.\n\n223\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:33.570\n>> In Office.\n>> Yeah.\n\n224\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.050\n>> That was like a long time ago,\nwasn't it?\n\n225\n00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:35.610\nOkay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.440\nWell that's where I'm pulling from, so.\n\n227\n00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.630\nSo yeah, so you can see that as I haven't\ntoo far, you might lose some features.\n\n228\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.220\nAnd the different versions\nI have over there on the,\n\n229\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.640\ncan we pop that slide there for a second.\n\n230\n00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.420\nThere we go.\nI just have some different versions\n\n231\n00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.600\ndown here.\n\n232\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.120\nWe're in CC it goes all the way down to CS\nand then is actually starts the numbers.\n\n233\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:57.880\nSo then it goes 10 to.\n\n234\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.110\n>> Way back when.\n\n235\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.974\n>> Yeah and do you know that I have\na little note here that illustrator 1.0\n\n236\n00:13:03.974 --> 00:13:05.822\nwas realized in 1987.\n\n237\n00:13:05.822 --> 00:13:06.634\n>> Really?\n\n238\n00:13:06.634 --> 00:13:08.095\nWow.\n>> Yes.\n\n239\n00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:09.625\nLet's not talk about\nwhere we were in 1987.\n\n240\n00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:10.134\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:13:10.134 --> 00:13:12.530\n>> So we'll just go with that,\n\n242\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.810\nso all right.\n\n243\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.560\nSo let's move on to Tips and Tricks.\n\n244\n00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.430\nThis is just me trying to give you\na little bit of insight that I have\n\n245\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.160\nfound from teaching this product for\nover ten years,\n\n246\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.249\nusing the product for over ten years.\n\n247\n00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.520\nIt's all about your mouse cursor icon.\n\n248\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:36.310\nYou got to watch that little guy wherever\nit's going on your screen, whatever you're\n\n249\n00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:42.150\ndoing in Illustrator, that's the key to\nwhat's gonna happen when you click, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.070\nPeople get in and start clicking\nall over the place and are like,\n\n251\n00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:44.590\nwhy didn't it work,\n\n252\n00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.830\nwhy didn't it work and I'm like well\nwhat did the mouse cursor look like?\n\n253\n00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.840\nI don't know.\n\n254\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.040\nThat's gonna be your tried tale true,\nhow do we say that?\n\n255\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.860\n>> Tried and true?\n\n256\n00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.820\n>> Yes, tried and\ntrue method of what's gonna happen.\n\n257\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.850\nSo always watch your mouse cursor icon.\n\n258\n00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.280\nNext thing, single click versus double\nclick, they do different things.\n\n259\n00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.185\nSo if you get all click happy,\n\n260\n00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:08.616\nyou'll get to some places where you\nmight not know how you got there.\n\n261\n00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:10.282\nSo, but we'll explain all of these and\n\n262\n00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:13.362\nI'll show you all these different pit\nfalls to know how you can kinda back\n\n263\n00:14:13.362 --> 00:14:16.010\nyourself out of a corner when\nyou double click too many times.\n\n264\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.742\nMy biggest key, learn your shortcuts,\nkey, did you get that?\n\n265\n00:14:20.742 --> 00:14:23.574\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Learn your keyboard shortcuts,\n\n266\n00:14:23.574 --> 00:14:28.070\nit'll make you an extremely\nefficient user of Illustrator.\n\n267\n00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.350\nI didn't start out with\nkeyboard shortcuts.\n\n268\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.670\nI had to evolve to it.\n\n269\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:37.065\nBut now that I do that like\nall the time I can't go back.\n\n270\n00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:38.950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And I think you've actually,\n\n271\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.781\nyou've watched me.\n\n272\n00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:42.650\n[LAUGH]\n>> I have watched you make some documents\n\n273\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.762\nin here and it's the most\namazing thing you've ever seen.\n\n274\n00:14:45.762 --> 00:14:46.768\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One hand on the keyboard,\n\n275\n00:14:46.768 --> 00:14:47.385\none hand on the mouse.\n\n276\n00:14:47.385 --> 00:14:49.690\nAnd things are flying all over the screen.\n\n277\n00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.810\nBut without those keyboard shortcuts\nyou wouldn't be able to do that.\n\n278\n00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.470\n>> Yeah.\n\n279\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.970\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n280\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:54.770\n>> So very impressive.\n\n281\n00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.313\n>> And it makes you look like you\n\n282\n00:14:56.313 --> 00:15:01.003\nknow what you're doing [LAUGH].\nNo, it just makes you look like a master\n\n283\n00:15:01.003 --> 00:15:05.670\nbehind the keyboard, it's just [SOUND].\nSo learn your shortcuts.\n\n284\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.610\nThere are tons of resources out there.\n\n285\n00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.610\nSo they're everywhere.\n\n286\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.040\nThe Internet is filled with them and\nlots of great tips and tricks.\n\n287\n00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.840\nAlways keep learning.\n\n288\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.150\nThis product always evolves.\n\n289\n00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.840\nYou can never learn\neverything about Illustrator,\n\n290\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.980\nI just learned something like a couple\nmonths ago, I was like are you serious?\n\n291\n00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.940\nAnd it was like the smallest little thing,\n\n292\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.640\nI don't remember what it is right now, but\nit was like the tiniest little thing that\n\n293\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.499\nwas just like-\n>> Could have saved you some time\n\n294\n00:15:30.499 --> 00:15:31.106\nand, yeah.\n\n295\n00:15:31.106 --> 00:15:33.825\n>> Yeah, and\nwe were just talking about that today,\n\n296\n00:15:33.825 --> 00:15:38.110\nsomething in the select menu which\nwe'll go over in another episode.\n\n297\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.620\nThat I didn't learn for years, years.\n\n298\n00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.660\nAnd I was like why didn't I do this?\n\n299\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.195\nSo I'll show you all that.\n\n300\n00:15:44.195 --> 00:15:45.050\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.130\n>> The other thing,\n\n302\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.060\neverybody does it different.\n\n303\n00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.890\nI use Illustrator a certain way.\n\n304\n00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.900\nYou, well I'm not sure if\nyou use Illustrator [LAUGH],\n\n305\n00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.260\nbut you would use it a different way.\n\n306\n00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.040\nI use it for both print and web.\n\n307\n00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.031\nSome people use it just for\nprinting or just for t-shirt design.\n\n308\n00:16:01.031 --> 00:16:04.934\nSo whatever way you use Illustrator\nis the way that you know it and so\n\n309\n00:16:04.934 --> 00:16:10.027\nit's funny when you start talking to other\npeople that know Illustrator really well,\n\n310\n00:16:10.027 --> 00:16:13.395\nand they'll like I never do\nit that way I do it this way.\n\n311\n00:16:13.395 --> 00:16:16.235\nI'm like I didn't even know\nyou could do it that way, so\n\n312\n00:16:16.235 --> 00:16:19.840\nit's like you can get to the same\nend result so many different ways.\n\n313\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.310\nAnd just keep that in mind, that it's\nnot a one size fits all type of product.\n\n314\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.190\nJust like any of these Adobe products,\nreally.\n\n315\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.360\nI mean Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator,\n\n316\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.320\nit's all everybody's own bag,\nif you want to say it.\n\n317\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.480\nI know my stuff,\nif somebody came behind me,\n\n318\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.280\nthey'd be like,\nwhy did they do it that way?\n\n319\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.410\nThat's just the way I do it, so\njust kinda keep that in mind.\n\n320\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:47.000\nAnd [COUGH] PDF files,\nwe mentioned that a couple times.\n\n321\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:53.650\nYou can do some amazing things by\nopening PDFs in Illustrator, but\n\n322\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.290\nit all depends on where it came from.\n\n323\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.310\nIf it is a PDF created from Word,\n\n324\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.110\nyou're not gonna be able to do too much\nwith it opening up in Illustrator.\n\n325\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.290\nIf it was created from another Adobe\nproduct, to be created into a PDF,\n\n326\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.140\nthere's some really cool\nthings you can do with it,\n\n327\n00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.490\nthings that you would never think that,\nI need to get that out of that file.\n\n328\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.366\nIf you open up in Illustrator,\nyou'd be surprised what you can do.\n\n329\n00:17:16.366 --> 00:17:19.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it will, just a little point.\n\n330\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.190\nIt creates a ton of clipping masks,\n\n331\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.320\nyou probably don't know what that is\nright now, but it's just clipping mask\n\n332\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:30.255\nheaven when you get into some PDFs\nwhen you open up with Illustrator.\n\n333\n00:17:30.255 --> 00:17:36.479\nYou drill down enough in there,\nyou can get a lot of stuff out of the PDF.\n\n334\n00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:39.000\n>> Wow, can't wait to see it.\n\n335\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.693\nVonne thanks for that information, a great\nlook or overview of what we can expect\n\n336\n00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:48.110\nwith Adobe Illustrator in the upcoming\nepisodes that we've got lined up for\n\n337\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.020\nyou out there.\n\n338\n00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.675\nSo I hope everybody out there\nis as excited as I am and\n\n339\n00:17:51.675 --> 00:17:53.390\nVonne is to continue on.\n\n340\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.560\nLook forward to seeing you back for\nfuture episodes.\n\n341\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.950\nFor now, signing off.\n\n342\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.350\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n343\n00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.120\n>> I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n344\n00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.230\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n345\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.986\n>> Bye.\n\n346\n00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:07.460\n[SOUND]\n\n",
