00:00:18.942\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n4\n00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:21.684\nseries in\nthe Adobe Creative Cloud Suite 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.440\nMore specifically we're\nfocusing on InDesign.\n\n6\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.630\nJoining me in the studios\ntoday is Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.560\nErica, how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.208\n>> I'm doing pretty good, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:29.235\nThanks.\n>> Hey, very good.\n\n10\n00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:31.039\nSo what are we gonna be\ndiving into first today?\n\n11\n00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.520\n>> Today,\nwe're gonna start at the very beginning.\n\n12\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.210\nWe're going to start\nwhere you would start.\n\n13\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.830\nWhen you first sit down\nto work in InDesign\n\n14\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.810\nwith a black screen staring\nyou back in the face.\n\n15\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.870\nSo we're gonna start there.\n\n16\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.750\nI'm gonna go ahead, and jump in, and\n\n17\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.150\nshow you a couple of different\nways to get into InDesign.\n\n18\n00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.220\nThe first one is that you would\nlaunch the application, however,\n\n19\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.680\nyou launch applications.\n\n20\n00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.040\nThat could be down on your dock so\n\n21\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.620\nit might be sitting on your\ndock if you have a Mac.\n\n22\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.710\nIf you're on a PC you might\nhave it in your Start menu.\n\n23\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.580\nAnd however, you would launch it we\ncan just click on it and launch it.\n\n24\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.370\nI already had it running so\nit's pretty quick,\n\n25\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.220\notherwise you get the start up screen\nwhich may or may not take awhile.\n\n26\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.950\nSometimes the first time you launch it,\ndon't be afraid, it might take awhile.\n\n27\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.220\nAlso when you do an update,\nit tends to take longer.\n\n28\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.240\nThat freaks people out sometimes.\n\n29\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.080\nJust keep calm, it's all right.\n\n30\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.027\nI'm gonna actually hide that.\n\n31\n00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:25.228\nI'm gonna use a command that I use on the\nMac which is Cmd+H, a Ctrl+H on the PC.\n\n32\n00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:27.603\nAnd I just wanna show you\nthis before we get in to it,\n\n33\n00:01:27.603 --> 00:01:31.141\nthat when I'm hitting my modifier keys,\ndown at the bottom I have the little\n\n34\n00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:33.657\nsymbols that show me what\nmodifier key I'm hitting.\n\n35\n00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:36.946\nSo you're gonna see that throughout\nevery episode that I work on, so\n\n36\n00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:38.886\njust you can see what it is I'm hitting.\n\n37\n00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.960\nNow I'm hitting the Cmd key or\nthe swirly propeller key or\n\n38\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.174\nwherever we wanna call it\nsometimes known as the Apple key.\n\n39\n00:01:45.174 --> 00:01:50.504\nAnd I'm in the Apple of course, and on\nthe PC that's going to be the Ctrl key so\n\n40\n00:01:50.504 --> 00:01:55.096\nif you see this symbol that's Cmd or\nCtrl, you'll here me say both\n\n41\n00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:59.880\ncommands what I speak about what key\nI'm hitting so I say Cmd or Ctrl.\n\n42\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.420\nMac vs PC second.\n\n43\n00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.760\nThe other one is option.\n\n44\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.780\nThat's what that little crazy icon means.\n\n45\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.450\nThat's option.\n\n46\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.280\nAnd I have a control key on the Mac\nthat is right click on a PC,\n\n47\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.030\nor if you have a multi\nbutton mouse on a Mac also.\n\n48\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.300\nAnd again, I will say right-click or\nCtrl+click.\n\n49\n00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.140\nAnd that is what the Shift key looks like.\n\n50\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.936\nSo you see these little symbols up here?\n\n51\n00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:23.660\nIt's only going to be when I'm doing\nsomething with a modifier key,\n\n52\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.210\nso don't be nervous with that.\n\n53\n00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.300\nSo I'm gonna do Cmd or\nCtrl+H to hide that cuz I wanna\n\n54\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.630\nshow you a couple different\nways to get in there as well.\n\n55\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.450\nThe other thing that we can do is we can\nlaunch from an actual InDesign document.\n\n56\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.610\nSo I'm gonna open up a file here.\n\n57\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.795\nI've just got some blank layouts.\n\n58\n00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.690\nWe're gonna talk about the different\nlayouts in just a minute.\n\n59\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.172\nAnd I just want to zoom in a little and\nshow you what the icon looks like.\n\n60\n00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:50.280\nSo in depending on your version and\nwe are talking about CC 2015 but\n\n61\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.200\nyou might be on an older version and\nmost of what I cover,\n\n62\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.010\nwill actually apply to older versions,\nprobably going back as far as CS6 so,\n\n63\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.990\ndon't be worried if you are not\non the newest newest version.\n\n64\n00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.660\nAnd I will try to point out if\nthat's a brand new feature as well.\n\n65\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.920\nSometimes trying to remember which version\nof 2015 that new feature came out in\n\n66\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.220\nis tricky, because with the Cloud\nthe updates are coming a lot faster.\n\n67\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.040\nWhen they get a new feature\nthey just throw it in.\n\n68\n00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.900\nFor instance, just recently there was one,\nand it just made a few minor tweaks, so\n\n69\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.570\nyours might like look again slightly\ndifferent if you haven't done\n\n70\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.750\nthe latest update.\n\n71\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.390\nBut going back to the file,\nthe file here, the file format is .indd.\n\n72\n00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.558\nThat's the file extension.\n\n73\n00:03:31.558 --> 00:03:35.880\nThat's an InDesign document, and\nas we go throughout the different episodes\n\n74\n00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.520\nin the course we're going to actually, see\nthat there are some other extensions and\n\n75\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.460\nI'll point those out as we go along,\nbut indd means an InDesign\n\n76\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.370\ndocument it's something that we've\nlayed out in InDesign ready to go.\n\n77\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.280\nSo one of the things that we can\ndo is also just double-click,\n\n78\n00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.290\nI'm one of those obviously and\nit brings up an existing file.\n\n79\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.920\nI'm gonna close that,\nCmd or Ctrl+W to do that.\n\n80\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.130\nOr we can always go to the File menu and\nchoose Close.\n\n81\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.650\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna hide out of that as well.\n\n82\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.750\nAnd the other thing we can do is we can\nswitch if you have a switcher on a Mac.\n\n83\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.010\nWe can just do the Cmd+Tab to\nswitch between open applications.\n\n84\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.200\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n85\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.660\nAnd this is sort of how I start.\n\n86\n00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.550\nI tend to launch the program and\n\n87\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.710\nthen I create a new document if I\ndon't have one already existing.\n\n88\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.580\nSo to create a new document\nwe have to really think about\n\n89\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.902\nwhere this document is headed,\nnot just let's just dive right in.\n\n90\n00:04:30.902 --> 00:04:33.240\nEven though I said we're gonna\njust dive right in which we are.\n\n91\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.420\nBut we're gonna dive in, we're gonna\nthink about this ahead of time.\n\n92\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.162\nWhat is happening to\nthis file down the road.\n\n93\n00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:43.730\nSo at something I can't stress enough,\nwe don't live in a vacuum.\n\n94\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.310\nEven if it's just me doing all\nthe production, I'm gonna start here and\n\n95\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.980\nI'm gonna make a printed version and\nI'm gonna do a digital version.\n\n96\n00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.150\nBut I still need to know what\nhappens to that down the road.\n\n97\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.840\nAnd as we go through the episodes,\n\n98\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.990\nwe will see all the considerations\nthat we need to make.\n\n99\n00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.070\nSo right now,\nthis might not make much sense to you.\n\n100\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.650\nI'm telling you to think ahead.\n\n101\n00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.420\nBut maybe this is all very new to you,\nand you're not even sure what is ahead.\n\n102\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.450\nSo we will learn that as we go through.\n\n103\n00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.747\nSo we're going to start\nwith a new document.\n\n104\n00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:19.111\nAnd I'll discuss the considerations we\nneed to make but don't stress out too\n\n105\n00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:23.610\nmuch if you don't understand that it will\nall become clear but I want you to think\n\n106\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.390\nabout what the information is that\nwe're putting in each of this.\n\n107\n00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.740\nSo if you think I don't understand what\nshe meant by is a digital or print.\n\n108\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.870\nThat's something you can notate\nto yourself, I need to look at,\n\n109\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.590\nam I doing this print or digital?\n\n110\n00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.710\nSo I'm gonna open up the new\ndocument dialog box.\n\n111\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.180\nSo I can do Cmd or Ctrl+N to do that.\n\n112\n00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.930\nOr, I'm gonna cancel out of that\njust I can show you the menu option,\n\n113\n00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.880\nFile > New and then we scroll\nover here to the new document.\n\n114\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.390\nAnd you can see I've got the little\nkeyboard shortcut for me right here and\n\n115\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.510\ndepending if you're on the PC it\nwill look a little different but\n\n116\n00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.942\nyou'll see your shortcut indicated for\nyou.\n\n117\n00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:03.176\nWe're gonna talk about shortcuts\nin an upcoming episode as well.\n\n118\n00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:07.357\nSo now we're gonna use the one\nthat's there, new document, and\n\n119\n00:06:07.357 --> 00:06:08.980\nI can turn on Preview.\n\n120\n00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.590\nI don't remember what\nversion this came in.\n\n121\n00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.898\nSomewhere in the cloud, probably 2014.\n\n122\n00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:16.400\nWhere I can actually see the page,\nbefore we used to have to enter it.\n\n123\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.550\nSo you might not have that Preview button.\n\n124\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.460\nAnd you enter the information and\nhit OK and it's not what you look like.\n\n125\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.280\nSo they added this Preview button which\nis great which means I can watch things\n\n126\n00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.990\nbeing formed as I make changes to them.\n\n127\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.930\nI can see that that is not what I want.\n\n128\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.020\nI can also see that at the top\nhere it says Document Preset,\n\n129\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.802\nit is something called postcards.\n\n130\n00:06:35.802 --> 00:06:40.335\nWell, that's not what I want we're gonna\nstart with just a letter size page and\n\n131\n00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:44.208\nwe're going to work with single pages for\nquite a while.\n\n132\n00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:46.940\nWe're not gonna get into it until we\nlearn a few more of the basics and\n\n133\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.180\nstart building on it,\nthen we can start adding pages.\n\n134\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.250\nBut for now we're gonna work for\nthe single page, letter size.\n\n135\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.460\nIt's a US letter so if you're not in the\nUS, of course, just adjust it accordingly.\n\n136\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.920\nI am gonna work in inches as well so\nadjust that accordingly.\n\n137\n00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.850\nI'm gonna show you how to change that in\njust a minute as well because InDesign\n\n138\n00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.560\ndoes not ship with inches as\nits default measurement, nor\n\n139\n00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.340\ndoes it ship with anything metric.\n\n140\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.910\nIt ships with printing terms,\npicas and points.\n\n141\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.210\nSo let's start putting in our information.\n\n142\n00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.440\nSo we see that\nthe Document Preset is postcards.\n\n143\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.060\nIt will probably show default\nthe first time you open that,\n\n144\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.510\nwhich is actually a letter.\n\n145\n00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.290\nBut we're not gonna worry\nabout that to start with,\n\n146\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.500\nbecause what we're going to\ndo is we're going to enter in\n\n147\n00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.242\nall the information in this dialog box,\nand then we're gonna save that preset.\n\n148\n00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:36.630\nWe're gonna tell it what\nthat preset is called so\n\n149\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.260\nwe don't have to enter\nall this stuff again.\n\n150\n00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.632\nThat's what we're trying to do.\n\n151\n00:07:40.632 --> 00:07:44.675\nYou're gonna see that I'm really about\nautomation and not doing the same thing\n\n152\n00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:47.568\nover and over again, not just so\nthat I get done sooner but\n\n153\n00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:51.150\nbecause I know it will be consistent\nif I set this up ahead of time.\n\n154\n00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.000\nSo always be thinking am I\ngoing to use this again?\n\n155\n00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.097\nMaybe I need to name it in such\na way that I can find it again.\n\n156\n00:07:57.097 --> 00:07:59.448\nSo let's start first here with Intent.\n\n157\n00:07:59.448 --> 00:08:03.293\nSo it's going to ask you what are you\ndoing with this file, this goes back to,\n\n158\n00:08:03.293 --> 00:08:04.962\nwhat are we doing with this file?\n\n159\n00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:07.092\nAnd InDesign right there in your face and\nit says,\n\n160\n00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:08.900\nwhat are you doing with this file?\n\n161\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.201\nSo you have a couple different options.\n\n162\n00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:13.020\nYou have Print, Web, and Mobile.\n\n163\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.760\nNow, Web and Mobile, there's some overlap\nto that but Print, I'm gonna start with.\n\n164\n00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.466\nAnd for me,\nif I know that it's going to print and\n\n165\n00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.522\nit's going to some digital format.\n\n166\n00:08:22.522 --> 00:08:25.551\nWhether it's something I'm\nsetting up say for a web page or\n\n167\n00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.774\na web layout, which I generally\ndon't do a lot of in InDesign.\n\n168\n00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:31.350\nBut sometimes I might do a layout and\nI know I'm going to send it.\n\n169\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.770\nIt's maybe just going to be a background,\nand I didn't do it say, in Photoshop.\n\n170\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.293\nI use InDesign a lot for things,\n\n171\n00:08:37.293 --> 00:08:41.426\nbecause there's a lot of crossover between\nIllustrator and Photoshop and InDesign.\n\n172\n00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:44.398\nI even find that for\nme InDesign makes more sense.\n\n173\n00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:47.490\nI can always save it in a format\nlater that I would send to Photoshop.\n\n174\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:53.340\nSo I might say, I need a background for\na web page and I would set it up web.\n\n175\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.390\nBut let's say,\nI'm going to go to print first, and\n\n176\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.980\nwe're gonna print\na version of this document.\n\n177\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.859\nLet's just say, we're gonna work with\na one page ad, something very simple.\n\n178\n00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:04.255\nAnd we're gonna print it, but\nwe're also going to make a PDF of it,\n\n179\n00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:05.710\nwhich is digital.\n\n180\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.670\nSo Web or Mobile?\n\n181\n00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.030\nSo again, is it Web or is it Mobile?\n\n182\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.972\nWell it's a PDFm, it's digital.\n\n183\n00:09:11.972 --> 00:09:13.160\nDigital isn't an option.\n\n184\n00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.890\nSo we're gonna look at that,\nbut Print is more restrictive.\n\n185\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.294\nSo when we start looking at things\nlike resolution and colors, there's\n\n186\n00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:26.058\na more narrow space because when we go\nto Print, we're actually putting ink or\n\n187\n00:09:26.058 --> 00:09:29.185\ntoner on paper or\nother things that we can print on.\n\n188\n00:09:29.185 --> 00:09:32.310\nBut we're kinda working on\nthis more restrictive space so\n\n189\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.700\nif we're going to print on something else,\nstart with Print.\n\n190\n00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.420\nIt's a little more narrow,\nwe can always work out from there.\n\n191\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.600\nWe start with the web,\n\n192\n00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.910\nit assumes that it's already kind of\nthis loosey-goosey kind of thing.\n\n193\n00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:48.770\nAnd then when we wanna go to print, it\nsays you can't, you set it up too broad.\n\n194\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.440\nSo hopefully that makes sense.\n\n195\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.696\nSo I'm gonna choose print to start with.\n\n196\n00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:56.240\nAnd when I do that,\nmy page sizes down here are print related.\n\n197\n00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.670\nSo the ones at the top\nare ones that I've added,\n\n198\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.790\nbecause we can add custom\nones along the way.\n\n199\n00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.040\nBut the ones you'll probably\nsee are Letter, Legal, Tabloid,\n\n200\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.510\nLetter half, which is eight and a half\nby five and a half, and a legal half.\n\n201\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.378\nWe've got some European sizes as well.\n\n202\n00:10:08.378 --> 00:10:10.699\nAnd a couple of really useless\nones down here at the bottom.\n\n203\n00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:12.070\nI never use these, compact disc.\n\n204\n00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.085\nThat's basically the size of\nthe insert that goes in a compact disc.\n\n205\n00:10:16.085 --> 00:10:17.178\nWhat's a compact disc?\n\n206\n00:10:17.178 --> 00:10:18.581\nNobody uses those anymore.\n\n207\n00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:20.927\nSo I don't even use those at all.\n\n208\n00:10:20.927 --> 00:10:23.844\nI'm gonna start with letter,\npretty basic, as I said.\n\n209\n00:10:23.844 --> 00:10:27.030\nAnd I'm going to tell how many pages.\n\n210\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.730\nI generally start with 1 page, unless for\n\n211\n00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.655\na fact you're doing\na 12 page doc document.\n\n212\n00:10:32.655 --> 00:10:35.305\nMaybe they so,\nwe need a 12 page newsletter.\n\n213\n00:10:35.305 --> 00:10:36.595\nI tend not to put that in there,\n\n214\n00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:40.585\nI just leave it at 1 because you can\nadd pages super easy on the fly.\n\n215\n00:10:40.585 --> 00:10:42.785\nUnless you absolutely know how many pages.\n\n216\n00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:45.760\nStart page,\nI'm gonna leave that as page number 1.\n\n217\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.816\nWhen we get into a later episode,\nwe'll talk about sections and numbers and\n\n218\n00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:50.020\nwe can change all that again.\n\n219\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.069\nWe don't need to worry about that.\n\n220\n00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:54.270\nOver here is Facing Pages.\n\n221\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.580\nAnd we'll see what that looks like\nwhen we open up the pages panel.\n\n222\n00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.710\nAnd Facing Pages just means that we're\ngonna see what's sitting side by side.\n\n223\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.710\nThere are some restrictions\nusing Facing pPages.\n\n224\n00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.610\nIt knows where the spine\nis in your document.\n\n225\n00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.380\nMeaning when two pages are butted\nup against each other,\n\n226\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.660\nit knows that where they butt up\nagainst each other is a spine.\n\n227\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.770\nSo this is a right page and a left page\nand for me, I tend not to use those.\n\n228\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.250\nBecause you are now restricted to\na right hand page being odd numbered and\n\n229\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:27.310\na left hand page being even numbered,\nso I tend not to do that too often.\n\n230\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.479\nHowever, there are some items along\nthe way that we'll see that require\n\n231\n00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:35.986\nfacing pages because the way it's setup\nit says, is that on a right hand page or\n\n232\n00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:37.036\na left hand page?\n\n233\n00:11:37.036 --> 00:11:41.510\nIf you don't have Facing Pages checked,\nit's a series of single pages.\n\n234\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:46.190\nNow the reason I do that for my workflow\nand again, if you're new to workflow,\n\n235\n00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.850\nyou might not know what your preferences.\n\n236\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.430\nIf you've been working in layout for\n\n237\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.270\nawhile in another program or whatever or\nyou've been using InDesign and\n\n238\n00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.340\nyou're just trying to get a little\nmore knowledge base underneath it.\n\n239\n00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.990\nYou might find that facing pages works for\nyou.\n\n240\n00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.960\nFor me, it doesn't because everything\nI do pretty much eventually goes\n\n241\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.003\nto a single page layout PDFs.\n\n242\n00:12:09.003 --> 00:12:12.594\n>> Yeah, Erica, and one other thing I was\ngonna ask you or so, it seems like intent.\n\n243\n00:12:12.594 --> 00:12:16.155\nYou really have to know what you're gonna\ndo ahead of time, whether you're gonna be\n\n244\n00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:19.530\nrestrictive, whether you're gonna have\na little bit more flexibility here.\n\n245\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.993\nNow, you've also mentioned that you can\nchange pages later on down the road,\n\n246\n00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:23.900\nif you will.\n\n247\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.034\nHow about the Facing Pages as\nthat being so restrictive,\n\n248\n00:12:26.034 --> 00:12:28.934\nis that something you need to change\nlater or is that something we select now?\n\n249\n00:12:28.934 --> 00:12:29.680\nAnd that's where we're gonna stay.\n\n250\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.030\n>> You can absolutely change it.\n\n251\n00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.740\nIf you choose Facing Pages now,\nyou can decide later.\n\n252\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.865\nIn fact for a lot of times,\nI'd forgot that it's on.\n\n253\n00:12:36.865 --> 00:12:40.035\nOnce it's on, it's sticky, and\nit stays on when you create a new one.\n\n254\n00:12:40.035 --> 00:12:44.597\nAnd especially when you update to an\nimmersion, it starts out as Facing Pages.\n\n255\n00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.922\nAnd soo usually for the first week or two\nof having a new version, I have to keep\n\n256\n00:12:47.922 --> 00:12:51.670\ntelling it oops, so it happens is facing\nit pages, we can go back and change that.\n\n257\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.372\nIn fact, I'm just gonna go ahead and just\nanswer your question and show you that.\n\n258\n00:12:54.372 --> 00:12:55.442\nI'm gonna click face and pages,\n\n259\n00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:58.252\ndon't worry about anything else right now,\nwe are coming back right back to this.\n\n260\n00:12:58.252 --> 00:13:00.668\nFacing pages I'm gonna\nlook at the pages panel.\n\n261\n00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:02.960\nWe are gonna talk about panels\nin just a minute just as well.\n\n262\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.630\nBut I can here is a see a Facing Page, and\nI can see that there is this spine down\n\n263\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.480\nthe middle, it says this is page\none is on the right hand side.\n\n264\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.892\nAs I add pages,\ndon't worry about how I'm doing it.\n\n265\n00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:15.180\nI'm gonna give you all of this later,\njust kind of a little preview right,\n\n266\n00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.640\nkind of build the suspense.\n\n267\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.200\nAs I do that I now have a left page and\n\n268\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.600\na right page, and those sit side by side,\nthose are Facing Pages.\n\n269\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.880\nAt any time,\nI can come back to the File menu and\n\n270\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.960\ncome down to page document set up and\nchange that, and deselect those.\n\n271\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.840\nNow depending what I have and\nhaven't put on the page,\n\n272\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.620\nyou may get an alert that says, do you\nwant to keep these in these spreads, and\n\n273\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.260\nthat's what those are, those groups\nof pages together are spreads.\n\n274\n00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.080\nSo we've got pages, and then the two\npages together create a spread.\n\n275\n00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.578\nWhen I'm working with not phasing pages,\nI'm working with single page spreads.\n\n276\n00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:52.720\nAnd so I can tell it, get rid of that and\nnow I've got single pages as well.\n\n277\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.800\nSo again, we're gonna get into pages and\nhow that works and all, but\n\n278\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.020\njust to kind of give you an idea what\nit will look like one way or the other.\n\n279\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.250\nSo let's go back to our new document.\n\n280\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.318\nI'm gonna close this, until it don't save.\n\n281\n00:14:02.318 --> 00:14:05.960\nI'm gonna go back to New,\nI use the keyboard shortcut Cmd or Ctrl+N,\n\n282\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.594\nback here.\n\n283\n00:14:06.594 --> 00:14:09.210\nAnd I'll start with print\nmostly Facing Page off.\n\n284\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.190\nWe're not gonna talk about\nprimary text frame right now,\n\n285\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.700\nthat'll be in the future episode.\n\n286\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.890\nMost are talking about master pages and\nthat's what that has to do with it.\n\n287\n00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.290\nSo let's do the Page Size again.\n\n288\n00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.060\nLet's go with letter.\n\n289\n00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.200\nNow letter you notice, it's still wide.\n\n290\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.395\nIt was a wide layout or\na landscape layout and it kept that, and\n\n291\n00:14:25.395 --> 00:14:27.612\nthat's what this little guy down here is.\n\n292\n00:14:27.612 --> 00:14:29.110\nThese are the orientations.\n\n293\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.600\nSo actually what I wanted was\na portrait orientation letter, so\n\n294\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.270\nI'm gonna click on that.\n\n295\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.970\nAnd I'm gonna come down here and\nI can choose the Width and the Height.\n\n296\n00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:42.490\nI can change that either by using the up\nand down arrow keys or I can type in here.\n\n297\n00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:48.690\nAnd I'm gonna give you a little tip, when\nyou want to put text inside a value box\n\n298\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.100\nand then design anywhere, you can either\ndrag across it or you can triple click it.\n\n299\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.310\nBut you'll get a repetitive stress\ninjury because you're gonna\n\n300\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.070\nbe clicking all the time.\n\n301\n00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.460\nHere's a little tip,\n\n302\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.641\njust click the type or the icon to\nthe left of any value box just once.\n\n303\n00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:04.307\nClick on it once and\nit automatically selects everything.\n\n304\n00:15:04.307 --> 00:15:08.247\nNow you're sure it selects everything\nbecause sometimes if you double-click or\n\n305\n00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:11.841\ntriple-click, you might forget,\nyou might miss that n that's there and\n\n306\n00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:13.966\ntype in a value and\nit says, n is not a value.\n\n307\n00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:17.020\nSo just a little tip there,\nso click on that.\n\n308\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.790\nYou can put in your own\nmeasurements that you need there.\n\n309\n00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.060\nHow many columns are we gonna have?\n\n310\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.790\nThis is great if you're doing column text.\n\n311\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.010\nMaybe you're doing a newsletter or\na newspaper and you need three columns of\n\n312\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.270\ntype, and you need a quarter of\nan inch between each column.\n\n313\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.724\nWe can set that here,\nthat's what the gutter is.\n\n314\n00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.150\nThat's the amount of space\nbetween the columns.\n\n315\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.250\nNow when we set that up here,\nall that's doing is creating guides.\n\n316\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.112\nIt's not going to automatically\ntell all your text boxes or\n\n317\n00:15:42.112 --> 00:15:44.066\nyour text frames to be in three columns.\n\n318\n00:15:44.066 --> 00:15:47.199\nIt just kinda lays it on the page so\nyou can see that.\n\n319\n00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:49.785\nSo I tend to leave that at 1.\n\n320\n00:15:49.785 --> 00:15:52.607\nJust leave it as it is,\none big column that's it,\n\n321\n00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:56.909\nwe can always come back on a page by page\nbasis and change that, so keep in mind\n\n322\n00:15:56.909 --> 00:16:01.548\nthat every thing that we're setting here\nis what each new page will be set up like,\n\n323\n00:16:01.548 --> 00:16:06.440\nbut we can always change each page\nto have different guides or columns.\n\n324\n00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.730\nSo let's go down here to margins.\n\n325\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.370\nIf you don't see any of this stuff,\nif you have an older version,\n\n326\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.850\nthere was a little button up here\nthat says show and hide more options.\n\n327\n00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.050\nAnd recently, and again, I don't remember\nwhat version, the versions come so\n\n328\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.200\nfast and\nfurious these days I can't keep track.\n\n329\n00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.220\nBut somewhere along the way, they changed\nit so it just says bleed and slug, and\n\n330\n00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.490\nyou've got this little arrow,\n\n331\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.370\nwhich sometimes is hard to realize\nis something you can click.\n\n332\n00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.500\nSo when you roll over it, I can say,\nthere's more information here.\n\n333\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.230\nSo if you don't see any of the things I\ntalk about, either click more options,\n\n334\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.950\nwhich used to be up here, or\ncome down here and say bleed and slug so\n\n335\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.320\nyou see everything.\n\n336\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.360\nSo margins, this is the amount of space at\nthe edge of your page where you don't want\n\n337\n00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.170\nyour items to get close to.\n\n338\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.970\nWe always want a margin even\nwhen we're working digitally.\n\n339\n00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.590\nWe don't want our text to come all\nthe way to the edge of our PDF.\n\n340\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.250\nWe like to see a little\nbit of space around it.\n\n341\n00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.490\nA little breathing room.\n\n342\n00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.850\nWhen we're printing\nthat's super important.\n\n343\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.930\nNow this margin amount might be something\nthat your printer tells you you need.\n\n344\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.900\nSo if you're actually going and\n\n345\n00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.190\nyou're printing it at a print shop,\nit's hard to say when I say printer.\n\n346\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.110\nAm I talking about the box on your desk or\n\n347\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.620\nam I talking about the shop that you\ngo to to actually get this printed.\n\n348\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.860\nSo when you go to your print shop,\n\n349\n00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.130\nthey might tell you you\nneed a quarter-inch margin.\n\n350\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.550\nOr in this case,\nthis is a five-sixteenths margin.\n\n351\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.380\nSo I need to put in\nthe amount of margin and\n\n352\n00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.540\nthen I don't want any of my elements\nto get closer than that on the page.\n\n353\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.900\nSo I can put in an amount.\n\n354\n00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.340\nAnd let's just change it\nto a quarter of an inch.\n\n355\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.080\nAnd when I hit Tab, it automatically\nfilled in those other values.\n\n356\n00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.350\nAnd that's because of this\nlittle guy right here.\n\n357\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.500\nThis is keep all measurements the same,\nor make all the settings the same.\n\n358\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.980\nAnd that just means when I put one in,\n\n359\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.710\nit automatically puts the same settings\non all four sides of the margin.\n\n360\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.700\nNow I can deselect that.\n\n361\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.950\nAnd now when I change it,\nI can just change one, and\n\n362\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.510\nwe'll do five-sixteenths here.\n\n363\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.380\nAnd only that one gets filled in that way.\n\n364\n00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.400\nSo actually I'm gonna click this back and\n\n365\n00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.800\nall my settings went\nback to being the same.\n\n366\n00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.099\nNow I can put in,\nhere's another tip on values.\n\n367\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.790\nIf I don't know what five-sixteenths\nis InDesign does math for you.\n\n368\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.320\nLet me repeat that,\nInDesign does math for you.\n\n369\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.420\nHow cool is that?\n\n370\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.580\nWho likes doing math?\n\n371\n00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.260\nNot me.\n\n372\n00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.120\nSo, I let InDesign do it for me.\n\n373\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.300\nSo, if I don't know a five-sixteenths is\nand I don't have a handy dandy chart and\n\n374\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:19.080\nI don't wanna pull it up from my phone to\nsee what it is I'm gonna type in 5/16.\n\n375\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.250\nThat's the fraction for that.\n\n376\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.070\nWhen I hit tab, it automatically\ndoes that conversion for me.\n\n377\n00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.830\nSo again, that's anywhere you put a value.\n\n378\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:30.360\nSo if you know you need to increase\nthe size of your page by 3 and 3 quarters\n\n379\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.290\ninches, you can actually put all that into\nthe value box and it does that for you.\n\n380\n00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.830\nJust another time-saving tip.\n\n381\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.108\nBut you'll use that all the time.\n\n382\n00:18:38.108 --> 00:18:42.050\nNow bleeding slug, you may or may not use,\nif you don't know what a slug is,\n\n383\n00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.760\nam gonna say you're not gonna need it\nbecause if you don't know what it is,\n\n384\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.895\nyou're not gonna need it.\n\n385\n00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:50.200\nSlug is just where you put some\ninformation off in the margin a little bit\n\n386\n00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.050\nthat may or may not print with the job and\nget cut off later.\n\n387\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.451\nSometimes it's a place where the client\ncan sign of that the proof looks okay.\n\n388\n00:18:56.451 --> 00:18:59.060\nI rarely use slugs anymore\n\n389\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.120\nsince everything's pretty digital I\ndon't hardly ever use that at all.\n\n390\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.850\nBut bleed you're probably gonna use.\n\n391\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:08.320\nAnd bleed is the amount of\nimage that comes off a page.\n\n392\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.197\nSo when you want to print, let's say you\nwant a photo that comes all the way to\n\n393\n00:19:12.197 --> 00:19:16.135\nthe edge of a page, you can't print all\nthe way to the edge of the page either on\n\n394\n00:19:16.135 --> 00:19:20.254\nthe printing press or on a digital copier\nbecause at some point that machine has to\n\n395\n00:19:20.254 --> 00:19:22.581\ngrab that piece of paper and\npull it through.\n\n396\n00:19:22.581 --> 00:19:26.516\nNow if you're going digital and you want\nyour photo to come to the edge of the page\n\n397\n00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:29.610\nyou could just put your photo\nright to the edge of the page.\n\n398\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.330\nI still use the bleed because you\ncould just shift it ever so slightly,\n\n399\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.850\neven if a pixel got shifted, you'd have\nthat strip of white down the side and\n\n400\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.670\nthat is just kind of annoying to me.\n\n401\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.710\nAgain, that's a personal preference.\n\n402\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.870\nBut the bleed is how much past\nthe page that image needs to come.\n\n403\n00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.650\nAnd the reason why we wanna set it up is\nso that we can make sure that when we put\n\n404\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.580\na photo on the page, we actually have\nthe photo go to that spot, on that page.\n\n405\n00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.080\nSo, for\nme I'm gonna put an eighth of an inch.\n\n406\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.770\nSo, I'll just put that in there,\nmake all settings the same.\n\n407\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.130\nSlug if I needed it,\nturn my preview on so I can see it.\n\n408\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.670\nAnd I'm gonna go back and\nmake a couple changes really quick,\n\n409\n00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.800\nwe're gonna look at the,\nactually let's save this first.\n\n410\n00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.080\nI'm gonna save it first and\nthen we'll make some changes and\n\n411\n00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.990\nlook at the other options that\nare available with web and mobile.\n\n412\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.050\nSo you notice that this changed\nfrom default to custom.\n\n413\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.190\nAs soon as we put our own\nmeasurements in there, it changed.\n\n414\n00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.100\nSo let's go ahead and save it.\n\n415\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.760\nThat's what this little icon here is.\n\n416\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.910\nIt used to look like a little floppy.\n\n417\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:20.830\nNow it looks like a hard drive,\n\n418\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.110\nwhich is crazy cuz we all\nsave to the cloud now anyway.\n\n419\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.400\nSo, they're gonna have to\nupdate that icon at some point.\n\n420\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.344\nBut what I'm gonna do is click on that,\nand\n\n421\n00:20:27.344 --> 00:20:29.230\nit's gonna ask me to save it with a name?\n\n422\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.750\nDocument preset.\n\n423\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.470\nWe'll call this Letter,\nI'll call it Letter New,\n\n424\n00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.310\nbecause I already have one called Letter.\n\n425\n00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.070\nSo give it a name.\n\n426\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.320\nLetter, postcards.\n\n427\n00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.440\nCall it Client Name, if it's client's\nspecialized mailing piece or whatever.\n\n428\n00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.930\nGive it something that you can remember.\n\n429\n00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.270\nAnd I save everything I put in here.\n\n430\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.210\nEven if I never use it,\nI can always go back and\n\n431\n00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.760\ndelete it if I realize I've\nnever used that preset again.\n\n432\n00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.640\nBut for me, the worst thing would\nbe to lay it out, get it ready and\n\n433\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.180\nbe like,\nI really like that I wanna use that again.\n\n434\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:57.920\nI didn't save it.\n\n435\n00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.540\nSo, now I got to find that file,\nopen it and\n\n436\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.520\nlook at the measurements that are there.\n\n437\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.350\n>> It really does seem like these\npresets Erica that you're showing\n\n438\n00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.001\nus make it efficient, you know that.\n\n439\n00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:07.985\n>> I know.\n>> You don't have to\n\n440\n00:21:07.985 --> 00:21:08.680\ndefine it all the time.\n\n441\n00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.606\nI'm an administrator and\none of the things we love is our scripts.\n\n442\n00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:13.293\nMaking things a little bit easier.\n\n443\n00:21:13.293 --> 00:21:13.863\n>> Yes.\n>> So\n\n444\n00:21:13.863 --> 00:21:15.701\nthese presets look like\nthey'll come in handy, and\n\n445\n00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:17.630\ndefinitely save you a lot\nof time down the road.\n\n446\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.910\n>> Absolutely, and not only a lot of time,\nwhich is great, but again consistency.\n\n447\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.310\nBecause you think it's no big deal.\n\n448\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.980\nI did that six moths ago and\nit's a little different so what.\n\n449\n00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.310\nThen you go to your trade show,\nyour annual trade show and\n\n450\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.770\nyou show up in all your stuffs is on the\ntable side by side at the same time and\n\n451\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.900\nyou realize each one\nlooks a little different.\n\n452\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.730\nSo any time InDesign gives you a choice\nof saving a preset or a preference.\n\n453\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.854\nSo you don't have to do it again I have\na little saying that I like to say,\n\n454\n00:21:42.854 --> 00:21:44.220\nif I can train a monkey to do it.\n\n455\n00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.890\nThere's probably a way\nto automate it InDesign.\n\n456\n00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.538\nI don't have a trained monkey but\nI do know where all the presets and\n\n457\n00:21:49.538 --> 00:21:51.300\nthe preferences are that can do that for\nme.\n\n458\n00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.307\nSo, let us go ahead and save that,\nand new already exist look at that,\n\n459\n00:21:55.307 --> 00:21:57.564\nI'm gonna have to call it Letter New 2.\n\n460\n00:21:57.564 --> 00:21:59.880\nI thought I got rid of all\nmy other ones that are here.\n\n461\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.930\nYou should see the crazy\nones I come up with.\n\n462\n00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.700\nSo, I have got that saved and\nnow I can say okay Create.\n\n463\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.260\nThere's my new document.\n\n464\n00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.480\nBut when I go to do a new document,\nI can pull that down again.\n\n465\n00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.660\nHere's my Letter New 2 that we just did,\nand I can say OK.\n\n466\n00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.070\nI don't even need to look at everything.\n\n467\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.640\nI know it's right.\n\n468\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.873\nWe already set that up and\nI'm ready to go.\n\n469\n00:22:17.873 --> 00:22:21.400\nQuickly, I'm gonna jump in here and\njust show you some of the other options.\n\n470\n00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:27.880\nSo let's say we wanna do Web, so when I\ndo Web my page sizes are now pixel sizes.\n\n471\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.510\nSo, common screen sizes although I\nsay common but they're kind of old.\n\n472\n00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.120\nIf you notice they're not\nvery high resolution.\n\n473\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.330\nSo, I have one actually here\nas preset that I called\n\n474\n00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.230\nWeb Old School because it's 800 by 600.\n\n475\n00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.200\nI have my margins in here.\n\n476\n00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.180\nNow you noticed, it says pixels.\n\n477\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.530\nSee now we're working with pixels and\n\n478\n00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.640\nnot interest cuz it knows\nwe're going to the web.\n\n479\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.320\nSame thing with mobile\nwhen I choose mobile my\n\n480\n00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.460\npage sizes are things like iPhone now.\n\n481\n00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.920\nThese are new, this is nice.\n\n482\n00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.060\niPhone 6 plus is actually in here,\niPad Retina was not in here for\n\n483\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:03.120\nthe longest time, iPad is 1024768\nthat is the resolution of an iPad.\n\n484\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.020\nHowever, iPad Retina\nis exactly twice that.\n\n485\n00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.280\nBut remember when I said\nInDesign does math?\n\n486\n00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.550\nLet's go to the iPad version.\n\n487\n00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:15.090\nI can just go times or\nthe asterisk, the star 2 and\n\n488\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.840\nthat's how I get my double because\nthe Retina is double resolution.\n\n489\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.470\nSo that's why I do it, but\n\n490\n00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.950\nnow it's nice because they\nactually have it in there for me.\n\n491\n00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:26.606\nSo again, depending on what it is\nwe choose that measurement changes.\n\n492\n00:23:26.606 --> 00:23:29.630\nSo I'm gonna say can't,\nactually let's open up that letter so\n\n493\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.148\nwe have a nice letter file here.\n\n494\n00:23:31.148 --> 00:23:33.704\nAnd then I wanna turn on my preview.\n\n495\n00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:35.789\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo a keyboard shortcut.\n\n496\n00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:37.748\nI'm gonna show you where\nthat lives in just a second.\n\n497\n00:23:37.748 --> 00:23:39.848\nBut I wanna show you\nwhat we got with that.\n\n498\n00:23:39.848 --> 00:23:41.453\nSo up here we have some margins.\n\n499\n00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:46.610\nWe have the black line is the outline\nof the page, the red line is the bleed.\n\n500\n00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.560\nThat's where we would\nhave to have images go to\n\n501\n00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.620\nif we want them to bleed off the page.\n\n502\n00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.180\nNow when we're printing a bleed, that\nmeans we have to print on larger paper.\n\n503\n00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.800\nWhen I said you can't print to the edge of\nthe paper, we print larger and come back\n\n504\n00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.849\nand trim that off, but we need to make\nsure we pull everything out to the bleed.\n\n505\n00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.220\nThe purple is the margin, so\nwe don't want anything to go pass that.\n\n506\n00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.640\nEven if we're doing a bleed, we don't\nwant text to sit too close to the edge.\n\n507\n00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.920\nBecause there's always that chance that\nif you're printing it it can be cut\n\n508\n00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.640\ncrooked and it'll be very noticeable.\n\n509\n00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.800\nSo you wanna give yourself that\nbreathing room that's there.\n\n510\n00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.900\nAnd I did wanna show you how to\nchange the measurements as well.\n\n511\n00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.530\nBecause I said it's\nautomatically picas and points.\n\n512\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.990\nSo I'm gonna come in here, and\nI'm gonna go into my preferences.\n\n513\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.409\nAnd I'm gonna do Cmd or Ctrl+K,\nwhich brings up my preferences.\n\n514\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:34.770\nOr they also live in the menu,\nI'm do InDesign on a Mac and\n\n515\n00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.740\nPreferences, on a PC it's under\nthe Edit menu > Preferences.\n\n516\n00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.533\nGot see the same place, and I'm gonna\ncome down to units and increments.\n\n517\n00:24:42.533 --> 00:24:46.520\nAnd over here on my horizontal and\nvertical ruler, I have inches.\n\n518\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.820\nSo it will say, I believe it's points,\nit might be picas, I can't remember.\n\n519\n00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.079\nBut it's definitely not inches or\ncentimeters.\n\n520\n00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:56.265\nSo change it to what you want,\nchange it on both your rulers there, and\n\n521\n00:24:56.265 --> 00:24:57.470\nwe'll say OK.\n\n522\n00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.330\nThe cool thing is though,\n\n523\n00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.000\neven when I'm working in a value box\nwhether it's a new item or whatever.\n\n524\n00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.390\nI can always put in different value, a\ndifferent unit and have it convert for me.\n\n525\n00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.040\nIf I know it's 25 centimeters\nI can do 25cm and when I\n\n526\n00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:16.300\nhit tab it will convert it to inches which\nis what I have set up for my preferences.\n\n527\n00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.735\nSo InDesign's very flexible in that way.\n\n528\n00:25:18.735 --> 00:25:23.450\nLet's look at Tools really quickly, we\nare gonna look at just a couple of tools.\n\n529\n00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.287\nAnd as we go through the different\nepisodes and when we start working\n\n530\n00:25:26.287 --> 00:25:29.199\nthe different functions,\nwe'll actually look at specific tools.\n\n531\n00:25:29.199 --> 00:25:30.932\nBut there is a couple that\nI want you to get used to.\n\n532\n00:25:30.932 --> 00:25:33.890\nI'm gonna come over here\nto this Tools panel.\n\n533\n00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.470\nSo we got panels everywhere, we are gonna\ntalk about that in an upcoming episode.\n\n534\n00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.640\nSo this panel here, I'm gonna go over\nto this little double headed arrow,\n\n535\n00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.900\nhopefully you can see that.\n\n536\n00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.250\nAnd click on that, and it puts it in\na double column, that's how I like it.\n\n537\n00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.613\nYou can leave it in the single\ncolumn if you like, but\n\n538\n00:25:47.613 --> 00:25:49.244\nI'm gonna actually tear this off.\n\n539\n00:25:49.244 --> 00:25:53.540\nI'm gonna grab this top handle and\npull it over, and just float it.\n\n540\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.560\nSo just so we can see it just a little\nmore centralized on our page.\n\n541\n00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.480\nAnd I'm gonna zoom in, and\nI have two arrow keys, why?\n\n542\n00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.970\nWhy do I have two arrow keys?\n\n543\n00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:03.980\nWell they have different names.\n\n544\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.121\nI have the Selection Tool, which is\nthe solid tool or the black arrow, however\n\n545\n00:26:08.121 --> 00:26:12.661\nyou wanna call that, sounds like a great\nsuperhero name, but it's probably taken.\n\n546\n00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:15.946\nSo I can come over here to the direct\nSelection Tool which is the hollow one or\n\n547\n00:26:15.946 --> 00:26:16.748\nthe white arrow.\n\n548\n00:26:16.748 --> 00:26:20.760\nAnd we're gonna see how those two work,\nbut basically the solid one,\n\n549\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.590\nthe Selection Tool, is when we're working\nwith containers or what we call frames.\n\n550\n00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.091\nEverything sits in a frame in InDesign,\nor a container.\n\n551\n00:26:28.091 --> 00:26:31.032\nAnd when I wanna manipulate or\nwork with or move the frame,\n\n552\n00:26:31.032 --> 00:26:32.368\nI use the Selection Tool.\n\n553\n00:26:32.368 --> 00:26:37.090\nWhen I wanna work with the content of that\nframe, I use the Direct Selection Tool.\n\n554\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.177\nAnd again this will all become clear\nas we start working with elements, but\n\n555\n00:26:40.177 --> 00:26:41.462\njust kind of keep that in mind.\n\n556\n00:26:41.462 --> 00:26:45.158\nInDesign's also smart enough that it\nswitches between the two depending on what\n\n557\n00:26:45.158 --> 00:26:45.928\nyou're doing.\n\n558\n00:26:45.928 --> 00:26:47.150\nIt get's smarter every time.\n\n559\n00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.610\nI don't know if that's a good thing or\na bad thing.\n\n560\n00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.460\nIt's a little scary.\n\n561\n00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.320\nWe also have the Type Tool.\n\n562\n00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.408\nWhenever we work with type or\ntext we're gonna use this tool.\n\n563\n00:26:54.408 --> 00:26:57.340\nWe're also gonna use it when we\nwork with tables which is type.\n\n564\n00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.954\nSo just keep that in mind,\nwe're gonna switch to that one a lot.\n\n565\n00:26:59.954 --> 00:27:02.927\nAnd if you notice it when I roll over it,\nnot only does it tell me the name, but\n\n566\n00:27:02.927 --> 00:27:05.050\nit also has that V,\nthat is the keyboard shortcut.\n\n567\n00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.555\nV and this one is A and\nthe Type Tool is T.\n\n568\n00:27:07.555 --> 00:27:09.767\nNow, I don't use those\nshortcuts very often,\n\n569\n00:27:09.767 --> 00:27:12.040\nmostly because they're\njust single letters.\n\n570\n00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.670\nIt's not option or alt or anything\nlike that, it's just the letter V.\n\n571\n00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.670\nIf you are sitting with your\ncursor in a text frame and\n\n572\n00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:23.490\nyou try to use the keyboard shortcut V,\nyou will just type V into your text frame.\n\n573\n00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.145\nAnd there are som other steps you can do\nto override that, that's too many steps.\n\n574\n00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:29.740\nI just go up to the Tool panel and\nclick on the tool that I want.\n\n575\n00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.792\nAlso, you might notice that under the T\nand some of these other ones, I've got\n\n576\n00:27:34.792 --> 00:27:38.846\nthis little black triangle and that's a\ndisclosure triangle usually twirl it down.\n\n577\n00:27:38.846 --> 00:27:41.349\nSo if you ever see a triangle and\nyou click on it, twirls down and\n\n578\n00:27:41.349 --> 00:27:43.020\ngives you more information.\n\n579\n00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.220\nThis actually shows you more tools,\nthey're hidden tools.\n\n580\n00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:46.850\nSo when I click and\n\n581\n00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.140\nhold on it, I can see that there\nare other tools hidden underneath there.\n\n582\n00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.325\nSo compared to my little,\nmy Pencil Tool here.\n\n583\n00:27:52.325 --> 00:27:55.280\nAnd I look and I've got some other\ndrawing tools underneath it.\n\n584\n00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.212\nI can also select the tool and\noption or alt, click on that and\n\n585\n00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:02.739\nit will scroll through maybe.\n\n586\n00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:06.070\nOption, and click on that, here we go.\n\n587\n00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.070\nSo I can scroll through the tools that\nway if I don't wanna click and hold.\n\n588\n00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.750\nThat just shows you that\nthere's some hidden tools.\n\n589\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.780\nAnd the last little tool at\nthe bottom that I wanna show you,\n\n590\n00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.980\nthe last little selections,\nare your preview modes.\n\n591\n00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.180\nSo when I first created that document,\nwe just had a blank page and\n\n592\n00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.650\nI couldn't see any of the margins or\nthe guides.\n\n593\n00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.640\nAnd I did that,\njust W was the keyboard shortcut for that.\n\n594\n00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.022\nI knew I didn't have any text frames so\nI knew I was okay,\n\n595\n00:28:28.022 --> 00:28:30.531\nI wasn't just gonna type w\n18 times because that's me.\n\n596\n00:28:30.531 --> 00:28:35.366\nI'd have my cursor on page 52 and type in\nw frantically to try to change the view\n\n597\n00:28:35.366 --> 00:28:37.979\nmode and I just typed in through page 52.\n\n598\n00:28:37.979 --> 00:28:38.855\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n599\n00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:42.630\nSo the default display that's there,\n\n600\n00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.750\nis just the normal display,\nthat shows everything.\n\n601\n00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.850\nAll your guides,\neverything that kinda behind the scenes.\n\n602\n00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.530\nWe've got the bleed, the margin.\n\n603\n00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:53.760\nIf we have items set to not print,\nbut we need to see where they are,\n\n604\n00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.143\nwe'll have those on the page,\nwe'll see that.\n\n605\n00:28:56.143 --> 00:28:58.590\nWe'll also see what's\ncalled the pasteboard,\n\n606\n00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.640\nthis gray area off to the side,\nand so we can see everything.\n\n607\n00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.630\nIf we've thrown things off to the side\nof the page, we can see it as well.\n\n608\n00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.290\nBut sometimes we wanna look at it how it's\nactually gonna look when it prints or\n\n609\n00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:09.840\nexports to PDF.\n\n610\n00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.720\nSo when I come here and hit the second\noption and that's Preview mode.\n\n611\n00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.080\nSo when I click that you notice that\nboth of the are W it's a toggle.\n\n612\n00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.800\nSo if I hit W it turns to preview back and\nfourth back and fourth.\n\n613\n00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:27.912\nSo that's just shows me everything\nhow it's going to look.\n\n614\n00:29:27.912 --> 00:29:30.138\nSo the guides go away, non-printing items,\n\n615\n00:29:30.138 --> 00:29:32.430\nanything that's off my\npaste board goes away.\n\n616\n00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.780\nIt's still there, we just can't see it.\n\n617\n00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.930\nSo I can do that, but I've got\na couple other ones hidden underneath.\n\n618\n00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:42.340\nI've got one called Bleed, that shows\nme the document with that bleed amount.\n\n619\n00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.070\nSo there is that quarter inch or whatever,\neighth of an inch that we had for a bleed.\n\n620\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.550\nAnd that's really good because\nif I do set up a bleed, and\n\n621\n00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.840\nI've pulled the images to the bleed.\n\n622\n00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.523\nI also wanna make sure\nthat it goes to the bleed.\n\n623\n00:29:53.523 --> 00:29:57.017\nI can't tell you how many times that\npeople have worked in design for\n\n624\n00:29:57.017 --> 00:29:58.441\n30 years sending files.\n\n625\n00:29:58.441 --> 00:29:59.881\nAnd they set up for a bleed, and\n\n626\n00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:03.160\nthey've only given me enough picture\nto go to the edge of the page.\n\n627\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.330\nI need that extra bit.\n\n628\n00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.480\nAgain, if it's being printed so\n\n629\n00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:12.290\nthat as it might waiver going through the\nprinting process or the cutting operation,\n\n630\n00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.550\nthat I have a little bit of extra\nwiggle room for that image.\n\n631\n00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.320\nBut this gives me a way to visually make\nsure, it's called pulling out your bleeds.\n\n632\n00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.920\nI make sure that I've pulled\neverything out to the bleed.\n\n633\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.350\nI can also do the same for\nslug if I have a slug setup,\n\n634\n00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.760\nwe did not have a slug\nsetup in this document.\n\n635\n00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.179\nAnd then also, one that they\nintroduced in I think it was CS6.\n\n636\n00:30:29.179 --> 00:30:33.060\nSo if you're on CS6 you should have this,\nis called presentation mode.\n\n637\n00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.810\nAnd that get's rid of everything,\nall your tools, everything, and\n\n638\n00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.880\nyou're basically just focused on the page.\n\n639\n00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.660\nThis is great if you just wanna scroll\nthrough and see your documents.\n\n640\n00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.010\nHow it's laid out, I can use the up and\ndown arrow keys to scroll for\n\n641\n00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:45.760\neach of those.\n\n642\n00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.790\nNow the background is black, you can\nchange that with a keyboard shortcut.\n\n643\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:54.170\nIf I do G I get gray, B brings me\nback to black, and W gives me white.\n\n644\n00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.600\nSo I can keep scrolling through those\ntil it gives me the look I want, and\n\n645\n00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.140\nI hit the Esc key when I'm done, and\nit brings me right back into in design.\n\n646\n00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.350\nSo that's just via first part,\nhow to get started,\n\n647\n00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:08.480\nhow to kinda get a document set up.\n\n648\n00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.965\nCouple of the tools get\nus familiar with that.\n\n649\n00:31:10.965 --> 00:31:12.080\nComing up episode,\n\n650\n00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.760\nwe're gonna actually talk about what all\nthis stuff is that's on our desktop here.\n\n651\n00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.600\nIt'll look Adobe workspace environment is.\n\n652\n00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.540\nSo I think we're good,\nwe're gonna stop there I think.\n\n653\n00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.093\n>> That sounds great,\nthat sounds like a real foundation.\n\n654\n00:31:26.093 --> 00:31:28.415\nAnd if any of this is new to you,\nmake sure that you go back and\n\n655\n00:31:28.415 --> 00:31:31.054\nlisten to Erica and some of the tips\nthat she's already provided.\n\n656\n00:31:31.054 --> 00:31:34.190\nErica does look like we're flexion\nmuscles of the clock over there, but\n\n657\n00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.280\nbefore we sign out,\ndo you have any addition words or\n\n658\n00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.370\ndo you wanna save that for\nthe next episode?\n\n659\n00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.940\n>> I think we'll save it, and we'll\njust jump right in with that next one.\n\n660\n00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:45.378\n>> That sounds good, well signing out for\nITPro.TV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n661\n00:31:45.378 --> 00:31:46.431\n>> And I'm Erica Gamet.\n\n662\n00:31:46.431 --> 00:31:47.419\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n663\n00:31:47.419 --> 00:31:54.438\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
