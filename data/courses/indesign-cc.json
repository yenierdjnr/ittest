00:00:18.942\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n4\n00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:21.684\nseries in\nthe Adobe Creative Cloud Suite 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.440\nMore specifically we're\nfocusing on InDesign.\n\n6\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.630\nJoining me in the studios\ntoday is Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.560\nErica, how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.208\n>> I'm doing pretty good, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:29.235\nThanks.\n>> Hey, very good.\n\n10\n00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:31.039\nSo what are we gonna be\ndiving into first today?\n\n11\n00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.520\n>> Today,\nwe're gonna start at the very beginning.\n\n12\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.210\nWe're going to start\nwhere you would start.\n\n13\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.830\nWhen you first sit down\nto work in InDesign\n\n14\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.810\nwith a black screen staring\nyou back in the face.\n\n15\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.870\nSo we're gonna start there.\n\n16\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.750\nI'm gonna go ahead, and jump in, and\n\n17\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.150\nshow you a couple of different\nways to get into InDesign.\n\n18\n00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.220\nThe first one is that you would\nlaunch the application, however,\n\n19\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.680\nyou launch applications.\n\n20\n00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.040\nThat could be down on your dock so\n\n21\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.620\nit might be sitting on your\ndock if you have a Mac.\n\n22\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.710\nIf you're on a PC you might\nhave it in your Start menu.\n\n23\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.580\nAnd however, you would launch it we\ncan just click on it and launch it.\n\n24\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.370\nI already had it running so\nit's pretty quick,\n\n25\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.220\notherwise you get the start up screen\nwhich may or may not take awhile.\n\n26\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.950\nSometimes the first time you launch it,\ndon't be afraid, it might take awhile.\n\n27\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.220\nAlso when you do an update,\nit tends to take longer.\n\n28\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.240\nThat freaks people out sometimes.\n\n29\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.080\nJust keep calm, it's all right.\n\n30\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.027\nI'm gonna actually hide that.\n\n31\n00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:25.228\nI'm gonna use a command that I use on the\nMac which is Cmd+H, a Ctrl+H on the PC.\n\n32\n00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:27.603\nAnd I just wanna show you\nthis before we get in to it,\n\n33\n00:01:27.603 --> 00:01:31.141\nthat when I'm hitting my modifier keys,\ndown at the bottom I have the little\n\n34\n00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:33.657\nsymbols that show me what\nmodifier key I'm hitting.\n\n35\n00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:36.946\nSo you're gonna see that throughout\nevery episode that I work on, so\n\n36\n00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:38.886\njust you can see what it is I'm hitting.\n\n37\n00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.960\nNow I'm hitting the Cmd key or\nthe swirly propeller key or\n\n38\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.174\nwherever we wanna call it\nsometimes known as the Apple key.\n\n39\n00:01:45.174 --> 00:01:50.504\nAnd I'm in the Apple of course, and on\nthe PC that's going to be the Ctrl key so\n\n40\n00:01:50.504 --> 00:01:55.096\nif you see this symbol that's Cmd or\nCtrl, you'll here me say both\n\n41\n00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:59.880\ncommands what I speak about what key\nI'm hitting so I say Cmd or Ctrl.\n\n42\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.420\nMac vs PC second.\n\n43\n00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.760\nThe other one is option.\n\n44\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.780\nThat's what that little crazy icon means.\n\n45\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.450\nThat's option.\n\n46\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.280\nAnd I have a control key on the Mac\nthat is right click on a PC,\n\n47\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.030\nor if you have a multi\nbutton mouse on a Mac also.\n\n48\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.300\nAnd again, I will say right-click or\nCtrl+click.\n\n49\n00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.140\nAnd that is what the Shift key looks like.\n\n50\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.936\nSo you see these little symbols up here?\n\n51\n00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:23.660\nIt's only going to be when I'm doing\nsomething with a modifier key,\n\n52\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.210\nso don't be nervous with that.\n\n53\n00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.300\nSo I'm gonna do Cmd or\nCtrl+H to hide that cuz I wanna\n\n54\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.630\nshow you a couple different\nways to get in there as well.\n\n55\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.450\nThe other thing that we can do is we can\nlaunch from an actual InDesign document.\n\n56\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.610\nSo I'm gonna open up a file here.\n\n57\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.795\nI've just got some blank layouts.\n\n58\n00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.690\nWe're gonna talk about the different\nlayouts in just a minute.\n\n59\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.172\nAnd I just want to zoom in a little and\nshow you what the icon looks like.\n\n60\n00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:50.280\nSo in depending on your version and\nwe are talking about CC 2015 but\n\n61\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.200\nyou might be on an older version and\nmost of what I cover,\n\n62\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.010\nwill actually apply to older versions,\nprobably going back as far as CS6 so,\n\n63\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.990\ndon't be worried if you are not\non the newest newest version.\n\n64\n00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.660\nAnd I will try to point out if\nthat's a brand new feature as well.\n\n65\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.920\nSometimes trying to remember which version\nof 2015 that new feature came out in\n\n66\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.220\nis tricky, because with the Cloud\nthe updates are coming a lot faster.\n\n67\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.040\nWhen they get a new feature\nthey just throw it in.\n\n68\n00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.900\nFor instance, just recently there was one,\nand it just made a few minor tweaks, so\n\n69\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.570\nyours might like look again slightly\ndifferent if you haven't done\n\n70\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.750\nthe latest update.\n\n71\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.390\nBut going back to the file,\nthe file here, the file format is .indd.\n\n72\n00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.558\nThat's the file extension.\n\n73\n00:03:31.558 --> 00:03:35.880\nThat's an InDesign document, and\nas we go throughout the different episodes\n\n74\n00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.520\nin the course we're going to actually, see\nthat there are some other extensions and\n\n75\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.460\nI'll point those out as we go along,\nbut indd means an InDesign\n\n76\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.370\ndocument it's something that we've\nlayed out in InDesign ready to go.\n\n77\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.280\nSo one of the things that we can\ndo is also just double-click,\n\n78\n00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.290\nI'm one of those obviously and\nit brings up an existing file.\n\n79\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.920\nI'm gonna close that,\nCmd or Ctrl+W to do that.\n\n80\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.130\nOr we can always go to the File menu and\nchoose Close.\n\n81\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.650\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna hide out of that as well.\n\n82\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.750\nAnd the other thing we can do is we can\nswitch if you have a switcher on a Mac.\n\n83\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.010\nWe can just do the Cmd+Tab to\nswitch between open applications.\n\n84\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.200\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n85\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.660\nAnd this is sort of how I start.\n\n86\n00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.550\nI tend to launch the program and\n\n87\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.710\nthen I create a new document if I\ndon't have one already existing.\n\n88\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.580\nSo to create a new document\nwe have to really think about\n\n89\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.902\nwhere this document is headed,\nnot just let's just dive right in.\n\n90\n00:04:30.902 --> 00:04:33.240\nEven though I said we're gonna\njust dive right in which we are.\n\n91\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.420\nBut we're gonna dive in, we're gonna\nthink about this ahead of time.\n\n92\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.162\nWhat is happening to\nthis file down the road.\n\n93\n00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:43.730\nSo at something I can't stress enough,\nwe don't live in a vacuum.\n\n94\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.310\nEven if it's just me doing all\nthe production, I'm gonna start here and\n\n95\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.980\nI'm gonna make a printed version and\nI'm gonna do a digital version.\n\n96\n00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.150\nBut I still need to know what\nhappens to that down the road.\n\n97\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.840\nAnd as we go through the episodes,\n\n98\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.990\nwe will see all the considerations\nthat we need to make.\n\n99\n00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.070\nSo right now,\nthis might not make much sense to you.\n\n100\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.650\nI'm telling you to think ahead.\n\n101\n00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.420\nBut maybe this is all very new to you,\nand you're not even sure what is ahead.\n\n102\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.450\nSo we will learn that as we go through.\n\n103\n00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.747\nSo we're going to start\nwith a new document.\n\n104\n00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:19.111\nAnd I'll discuss the considerations we\nneed to make but don't stress out too\n\n105\n00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:23.610\nmuch if you don't understand that it will\nall become clear but I want you to think\n\n106\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.390\nabout what the information is that\nwe're putting in each of this.\n\n107\n00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.740\nSo if you think I don't understand what\nshe meant by is a digital or print.\n\n108\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.870\nThat's something you can notate\nto yourself, I need to look at,\n\n109\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.590\nam I doing this print or digital?\n\n110\n00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.710\nSo I'm gonna open up the new\ndocument dialog box.\n\n111\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.180\nSo I can do Cmd or Ctrl+N to do that.\n\n112\n00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.930\nOr, I'm gonna cancel out of that\njust I can show you the menu option,\n\n113\n00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.880\nFile > New and then we scroll\nover here to the new document.\n\n114\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.390\nAnd you can see I've got the little\nkeyboard shortcut for me right here and\n\n115\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.510\ndepending if you're on the PC it\nwill look a little different but\n\n116\n00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.942\nyou'll see your shortcut indicated for\nyou.\n\n117\n00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:03.176\nWe're gonna talk about shortcuts\nin an upcoming episode as well.\n\n118\n00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:07.357\nSo now we're gonna use the one\nthat's there, new document, and\n\n119\n00:06:07.357 --> 00:06:08.980\nI can turn on Preview.\n\n120\n00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.590\nI don't remember what\nversion this came in.\n\n121\n00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.898\nSomewhere in the cloud, probably 2014.\n\n122\n00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:16.400\nWhere I can actually see the page,\nbefore we used to have to enter it.\n\n123\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.550\nSo you might not have that Preview button.\n\n124\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.460\nAnd you enter the information and\nhit OK and it's not what you look like.\n\n125\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.280\nSo they added this Preview button which\nis great which means I can watch things\n\n126\n00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.990\nbeing formed as I make changes to them.\n\n127\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.930\nI can see that that is not what I want.\n\n128\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.020\nI can also see that at the top\nhere it says Document Preset,\n\n129\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.802\nit is something called postcards.\n\n130\n00:06:35.802 --> 00:06:40.335\nWell, that's not what I want we're gonna\nstart with just a letter size page and\n\n131\n00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:44.208\nwe're going to work with single pages for\nquite a while.\n\n132\n00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:46.940\nWe're not gonna get into it until we\nlearn a few more of the basics and\n\n133\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.180\nstart building on it,\nthen we can start adding pages.\n\n134\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.250\nBut for now we're gonna work for\nthe single page, letter size.\n\n135\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.460\nIt's a US letter so if you're not in the\nUS, of course, just adjust it accordingly.\n\n136\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.920\nI am gonna work in inches as well so\nadjust that accordingly.\n\n137\n00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.850\nI'm gonna show you how to change that in\njust a minute as well because InDesign\n\n138\n00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.560\ndoes not ship with inches as\nits default measurement, nor\n\n139\n00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.340\ndoes it ship with anything metric.\n\n140\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.910\nIt ships with printing terms,\npicas and points.\n\n141\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.210\nSo let's start putting in our information.\n\n142\n00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.440\nSo we see that\nthe Document Preset is postcards.\n\n143\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.060\nIt will probably show default\nthe first time you open that,\n\n144\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.510\nwhich is actually a letter.\n\n145\n00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.290\nBut we're not gonna worry\nabout that to start with,\n\n146\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.500\nbecause what we're going to\ndo is we're going to enter in\n\n147\n00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.242\nall the information in this dialog box,\nand then we're gonna save that preset.\n\n148\n00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:36.630\nWe're gonna tell it what\nthat preset is called so\n\n149\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.260\nwe don't have to enter\nall this stuff again.\n\n150\n00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.632\nThat's what we're trying to do.\n\n151\n00:07:40.632 --> 00:07:44.675\nYou're gonna see that I'm really about\nautomation and not doing the same thing\n\n152\n00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:47.568\nover and over again, not just so\nthat I get done sooner but\n\n153\n00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:51.150\nbecause I know it will be consistent\nif I set this up ahead of time.\n\n154\n00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.000\nSo always be thinking am I\ngoing to use this again?\n\n155\n00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.097\nMaybe I need to name it in such\na way that I can find it again.\n\n156\n00:07:57.097 --> 00:07:59.448\nSo let's start first here with Intent.\n\n157\n00:07:59.448 --> 00:08:03.293\nSo it's going to ask you what are you\ndoing with this file, this goes back to,\n\n158\n00:08:03.293 --> 00:08:04.962\nwhat are we doing with this file?\n\n159\n00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:07.092\nAnd InDesign right there in your face and\nit says,\n\n160\n00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:08.900\nwhat are you doing with this file?\n\n161\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.201\nSo you have a couple different options.\n\n162\n00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:13.020\nYou have Print, Web, and Mobile.\n\n163\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.760\nNow, Web and Mobile, there's some overlap\nto that but Print, I'm gonna start with.\n\n164\n00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.466\nAnd for me,\nif I know that it's going to print and\n\n165\n00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.522\nit's going to some digital format.\n\n166\n00:08:22.522 --> 00:08:25.551\nWhether it's something I'm\nsetting up say for a web page or\n\n167\n00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.774\na web layout, which I generally\ndon't do a lot of in InDesign.\n\n168\n00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:31.350\nBut sometimes I might do a layout and\nI know I'm going to send it.\n\n169\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.770\nIt's maybe just going to be a background,\nand I didn't do it say, in Photoshop.\n\n170\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.293\nI use InDesign a lot for things,\n\n171\n00:08:37.293 --> 00:08:41.426\nbecause there's a lot of crossover between\nIllustrator and Photoshop and InDesign.\n\n172\n00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:44.398\nI even find that for\nme InDesign makes more sense.\n\n173\n00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:47.490\nI can always save it in a format\nlater that I would send to Photoshop.\n\n174\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:53.340\nSo I might say, I need a background for\na web page and I would set it up web.\n\n175\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.390\nBut let's say,\nI'm going to go to print first, and\n\n176\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.980\nwe're gonna print\na version of this document.\n\n177\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.859\nLet's just say, we're gonna work with\na one page ad, something very simple.\n\n178\n00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:04.255\nAnd we're gonna print it, but\nwe're also going to make a PDF of it,\n\n179\n00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:05.710\nwhich is digital.\n\n180\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.670\nSo Web or Mobile?\n\n181\n00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.030\nSo again, is it Web or is it Mobile?\n\n182\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.972\nWell it's a PDFm, it's digital.\n\n183\n00:09:11.972 --> 00:09:13.160\nDigital isn't an option.\n\n184\n00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.890\nSo we're gonna look at that,\nbut Print is more restrictive.\n\n185\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.294\nSo when we start looking at things\nlike resolution and colors, there's\n\n186\n00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:26.058\na more narrow space because when we go\nto Print, we're actually putting ink or\n\n187\n00:09:26.058 --> 00:09:29.185\ntoner on paper or\nother things that we can print on.\n\n188\n00:09:29.185 --> 00:09:32.310\nBut we're kinda working on\nthis more restrictive space so\n\n189\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.700\nif we're going to print on something else,\nstart with Print.\n\n190\n00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.420\nIt's a little more narrow,\nwe can always work out from there.\n\n191\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.600\nWe start with the web,\n\n192\n00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.910\nit assumes that it's already kind of\nthis loosey-goosey kind of thing.\n\n193\n00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:48.770\nAnd then when we wanna go to print, it\nsays you can't, you set it up too broad.\n\n194\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.440\nSo hopefully that makes sense.\n\n195\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.696\nSo I'm gonna choose print to start with.\n\n196\n00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:56.240\nAnd when I do that,\nmy page sizes down here are print related.\n\n197\n00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.670\nSo the ones at the top\nare ones that I've added,\n\n198\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.790\nbecause we can add custom\nones along the way.\n\n199\n00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.040\nBut the ones you'll probably\nsee are Letter, Legal, Tabloid,\n\n200\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.510\nLetter half, which is eight and a half\nby five and a half, and a legal half.\n\n201\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.378\nWe've got some European sizes as well.\n\n202\n00:10:08.378 --> 00:10:10.699\nAnd a couple of really useless\nones down here at the bottom.\n\n203\n00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:12.070\nI never use these, compact disc.\n\n204\n00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.085\nThat's basically the size of\nthe insert that goes in a compact disc.\n\n205\n00:10:16.085 --> 00:10:17.178\nWhat's a compact disc?\n\n206\n00:10:17.178 --> 00:10:18.581\nNobody uses those anymore.\n\n207\n00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:20.927\nSo I don't even use those at all.\n\n208\n00:10:20.927 --> 00:10:23.844\nI'm gonna start with letter,\npretty basic, as I said.\n\n209\n00:10:23.844 --> 00:10:27.030\nAnd I'm going to tell how many pages.\n\n210\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.730\nI generally start with 1 page, unless for\n\n211\n00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.655\na fact you're doing\na 12 page doc document.\n\n212\n00:10:32.655 --> 00:10:35.305\nMaybe they so,\nwe need a 12 page newsletter.\n\n213\n00:10:35.305 --> 00:10:36.595\nI tend not to put that in there,\n\n214\n00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:40.585\nI just leave it at 1 because you can\nadd pages super easy on the fly.\n\n215\n00:10:40.585 --> 00:10:42.785\nUnless you absolutely know how many pages.\n\n216\n00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:45.760\nStart page,\nI'm gonna leave that as page number 1.\n\n217\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.816\nWhen we get into a later episode,\nwe'll talk about sections and numbers and\n\n218\n00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:50.020\nwe can change all that again.\n\n219\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.069\nWe don't need to worry about that.\n\n220\n00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:54.270\nOver here is Facing Pages.\n\n221\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.580\nAnd we'll see what that looks like\nwhen we open up the pages panel.\n\n222\n00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.710\nAnd Facing Pages just means that we're\ngonna see what's sitting side by side.\n\n223\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.710\nThere are some restrictions\nusing Facing pPages.\n\n224\n00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.610\nIt knows where the spine\nis in your document.\n\n225\n00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.380\nMeaning when two pages are butted\nup against each other,\n\n226\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.660\nit knows that where they butt up\nagainst each other is a spine.\n\n227\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.770\nSo this is a right page and a left page\nand for me, I tend not to use those.\n\n228\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.250\nBecause you are now restricted to\na right hand page being odd numbered and\n\n229\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:27.310\na left hand page being even numbered,\nso I tend not to do that too often.\n\n230\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.479\nHowever, there are some items along\nthe way that we'll see that require\n\n231\n00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:35.986\nfacing pages because the way it's setup\nit says, is that on a right hand page or\n\n232\n00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:37.036\na left hand page?\n\n233\n00:11:37.036 --> 00:11:41.510\nIf you don't have Facing Pages checked,\nit's a series of single pages.\n\n234\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:46.190\nNow the reason I do that for my workflow\nand again, if you're new to workflow,\n\n235\n00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.850\nyou might not know what your preferences.\n\n236\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.430\nIf you've been working in layout for\n\n237\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.270\nawhile in another program or whatever or\nyou've been using InDesign and\n\n238\n00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.340\nyou're just trying to get a little\nmore knowledge base underneath it.\n\n239\n00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.990\nYou might find that facing pages works for\nyou.\n\n240\n00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.960\nFor me, it doesn't because everything\nI do pretty much eventually goes\n\n241\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.003\nto a single page layout PDFs.\n\n242\n00:12:09.003 --> 00:12:12.594\n>> Yeah, Erica, and one other thing I was\ngonna ask you or so, it seems like intent.\n\n243\n00:12:12.594 --> 00:12:16.155\nYou really have to know what you're gonna\ndo ahead of time, whether you're gonna be\n\n244\n00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:19.530\nrestrictive, whether you're gonna have\na little bit more flexibility here.\n\n245\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.993\nNow, you've also mentioned that you can\nchange pages later on down the road,\n\n246\n00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:23.900\nif you will.\n\n247\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.034\nHow about the Facing Pages as\nthat being so restrictive,\n\n248\n00:12:26.034 --> 00:12:28.934\nis that something you need to change\nlater or is that something we select now?\n\n249\n00:12:28.934 --> 00:12:29.680\nAnd that's where we're gonna stay.\n\n250\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.030\n>> You can absolutely change it.\n\n251\n00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.740\nIf you choose Facing Pages now,\nyou can decide later.\n\n252\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.865\nIn fact for a lot of times,\nI'd forgot that it's on.\n\n253\n00:12:36.865 --> 00:12:40.035\nOnce it's on, it's sticky, and\nit stays on when you create a new one.\n\n254\n00:12:40.035 --> 00:12:44.597\nAnd especially when you update to an\nimmersion, it starts out as Facing Pages.\n\n255\n00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.922\nAnd soo usually for the first week or two\nof having a new version, I have to keep\n\n256\n00:12:47.922 --> 00:12:51.670\ntelling it oops, so it happens is facing\nit pages, we can go back and change that.\n\n257\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.372\nIn fact, I'm just gonna go ahead and just\nanswer your question and show you that.\n\n258\n00:12:54.372 --> 00:12:55.442\nI'm gonna click face and pages,\n\n259\n00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:58.252\ndon't worry about anything else right now,\nwe are coming back right back to this.\n\n260\n00:12:58.252 --> 00:13:00.668\nFacing pages I'm gonna\nlook at the pages panel.\n\n261\n00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:02.960\nWe are gonna talk about panels\nin just a minute just as well.\n\n262\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.630\nBut I can here is a see a Facing Page, and\nI can see that there is this spine down\n\n263\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.480\nthe middle, it says this is page\none is on the right hand side.\n\n264\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.892\nAs I add pages,\ndon't worry about how I'm doing it.\n\n265\n00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:15.180\nI'm gonna give you all of this later,\njust kind of a little preview right,\n\n266\n00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.640\nkind of build the suspense.\n\n267\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.200\nAs I do that I now have a left page and\n\n268\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.600\na right page, and those sit side by side,\nthose are Facing Pages.\n\n269\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.880\nAt any time,\nI can come back to the File menu and\n\n270\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.960\ncome down to page document set up and\nchange that, and deselect those.\n\n271\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.840\nNow depending what I have and\nhaven't put on the page,\n\n272\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.620\nyou may get an alert that says, do you\nwant to keep these in these spreads, and\n\n273\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.260\nthat's what those are, those groups\nof pages together are spreads.\n\n274\n00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.080\nSo we've got pages, and then the two\npages together create a spread.\n\n275\n00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.578\nWhen I'm working with not phasing pages,\nI'm working with single page spreads.\n\n276\n00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:52.720\nAnd so I can tell it, get rid of that and\nnow I've got single pages as well.\n\n277\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.800\nSo again, we're gonna get into pages and\nhow that works and all, but\n\n278\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.020\njust to kind of give you an idea what\nit will look like one way or the other.\n\n279\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.250\nSo let's go back to our new document.\n\n280\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.318\nI'm gonna close this, until it don't save.\n\n281\n00:14:02.318 --> 00:14:05.960\nI'm gonna go back to New,\nI use the keyboard shortcut Cmd or Ctrl+N,\n\n282\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.594\nback here.\n\n283\n00:14:06.594 --> 00:14:09.210\nAnd I'll start with print\nmostly Facing Page off.\n\n284\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.190\nWe're not gonna talk about\nprimary text frame right now,\n\n285\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.700\nthat'll be in the future episode.\n\n286\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.890\nMost are talking about master pages and\nthat's what that has to do with it.\n\n287\n00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.290\nSo let's do the Page Size again.\n\n288\n00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.060\nLet's go with letter.\n\n289\n00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.200\nNow letter you notice, it's still wide.\n\n290\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.395\nIt was a wide layout or\na landscape layout and it kept that, and\n\n291\n00:14:25.395 --> 00:14:27.612\nthat's what this little guy down here is.\n\n292\n00:14:27.612 --> 00:14:29.110\nThese are the orientations.\n\n293\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.600\nSo actually what I wanted was\na portrait orientation letter, so\n\n294\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.270\nI'm gonna click on that.\n\n295\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.970\nAnd I'm gonna come down here and\nI can choose the Width and the Height.\n\n296\n00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:42.490\nI can change that either by using the up\nand down arrow keys or I can type in here.\n\n297\n00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:48.690\nAnd I'm gonna give you a little tip, when\nyou want to put text inside a value box\n\n298\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.100\nand then design anywhere, you can either\ndrag across it or you can triple click it.\n\n299\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.310\nBut you'll get a repetitive stress\ninjury because you're gonna\n\n300\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.070\nbe clicking all the time.\n\n301\n00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.460\nHere's a little tip,\n\n302\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.641\njust click the type or the icon to\nthe left of any value box just once.\n\n303\n00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:04.307\nClick on it once and\nit automatically selects everything.\n\n304\n00:15:04.307 --> 00:15:08.247\nNow you're sure it selects everything\nbecause sometimes if you double-click or\n\n305\n00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:11.841\ntriple-click, you might forget,\nyou might miss that n that's there and\n\n306\n00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:13.966\ntype in a value and\nit says, n is not a value.\n\n307\n00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:17.020\nSo just a little tip there,\nso click on that.\n\n308\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.790\nYou can put in your own\nmeasurements that you need there.\n\n309\n00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.060\nHow many columns are we gonna have?\n\n310\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.790\nThis is great if you're doing column text.\n\n311\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.010\nMaybe you're doing a newsletter or\na newspaper and you need three columns of\n\n312\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.270\ntype, and you need a quarter of\nan inch between each column.\n\n313\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.724\nWe can set that here,\nthat's what the gutter is.\n\n314\n00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.150\nThat's the amount of space\nbetween the columns.\n\n315\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.250\nNow when we set that up here,\nall that's doing is creating guides.\n\n316\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.112\nIt's not going to automatically\ntell all your text boxes or\n\n317\n00:15:42.112 --> 00:15:44.066\nyour text frames to be in three columns.\n\n318\n00:15:44.066 --> 00:15:47.199\nIt just kinda lays it on the page so\nyou can see that.\n\n319\n00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:49.785\nSo I tend to leave that at 1.\n\n320\n00:15:49.785 --> 00:15:52.607\nJust leave it as it is,\none big column that's it,\n\n321\n00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:56.909\nwe can always come back on a page by page\nbasis and change that, so keep in mind\n\n322\n00:15:56.909 --> 00:16:01.548\nthat every thing that we're setting here\nis what each new page will be set up like,\n\n323\n00:16:01.548 --> 00:16:06.440\nbut we can always change each page\nto have different guides or columns.\n\n324\n00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.730\nSo let's go down here to margins.\n\n325\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.370\nIf you don't see any of this stuff,\nif you have an older version,\n\n326\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.850\nthere was a little button up here\nthat says show and hide more options.\n\n327\n00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.050\nAnd recently, and again, I don't remember\nwhat version, the versions come so\n\n328\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.200\nfast and\nfurious these days I can't keep track.\n\n329\n00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.220\nBut somewhere along the way, they changed\nit so it just says bleed and slug, and\n\n330\n00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.490\nyou've got this little arrow,\n\n331\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.370\nwhich sometimes is hard to realize\nis something you can click.\n\n332\n00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.500\nSo when you roll over it, I can say,\nthere's more information here.\n\n333\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.230\nSo if you don't see any of the things I\ntalk about, either click more options,\n\n334\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.950\nwhich used to be up here, or\ncome down here and say bleed and slug so\n\n335\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.320\nyou see everything.\n\n336\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.360\nSo margins, this is the amount of space at\nthe edge of your page where you don't want\n\n337\n00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.170\nyour items to get close to.\n\n338\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.970\nWe always want a margin even\nwhen we're working digitally.\n\n339\n00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.590\nWe don't want our text to come all\nthe way to the edge of our PDF.\n\n340\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.250\nWe like to see a little\nbit of space around it.\n\n341\n00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.490\nA little breathing room.\n\n342\n00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.850\nWhen we're printing\nthat's super important.\n\n343\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.930\nNow this margin amount might be something\nthat your printer tells you you need.\n\n344\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.900\nSo if you're actually going and\n\n345\n00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.190\nyou're printing it at a print shop,\nit's hard to say when I say printer.\n\n346\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.110\nAm I talking about the box on your desk or\n\n347\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.620\nam I talking about the shop that you\ngo to to actually get this printed.\n\n348\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.860\nSo when you go to your print shop,\n\n349\n00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.130\nthey might tell you you\nneed a quarter-inch margin.\n\n350\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.550\nOr in this case,\nthis is a five-sixteenths margin.\n\n351\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.380\nSo I need to put in\nthe amount of margin and\n\n352\n00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.540\nthen I don't want any of my elements\nto get closer than that on the page.\n\n353\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.900\nSo I can put in an amount.\n\n354\n00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.340\nAnd let's just change it\nto a quarter of an inch.\n\n355\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.080\nAnd when I hit Tab, it automatically\nfilled in those other values.\n\n356\n00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.350\nAnd that's because of this\nlittle guy right here.\n\n357\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.500\nThis is keep all measurements the same,\nor make all the settings the same.\n\n358\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.980\nAnd that just means when I put one in,\n\n359\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.710\nit automatically puts the same settings\non all four sides of the margin.\n\n360\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.700\nNow I can deselect that.\n\n361\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.950\nAnd now when I change it,\nI can just change one, and\n\n362\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.510\nwe'll do five-sixteenths here.\n\n363\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.380\nAnd only that one gets filled in that way.\n\n364\n00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.400\nSo actually I'm gonna click this back and\n\n365\n00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.800\nall my settings went\nback to being the same.\n\n366\n00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.099\nNow I can put in,\nhere's another tip on values.\n\n367\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.790\nIf I don't know what five-sixteenths\nis InDesign does math for you.\n\n368\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.320\nLet me repeat that,\nInDesign does math for you.\n\n369\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.420\nHow cool is that?\n\n370\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.580\nWho likes doing math?\n\n371\n00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.260\nNot me.\n\n372\n00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.120\nSo, I let InDesign do it for me.\n\n373\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.300\nSo, if I don't know a five-sixteenths is\nand I don't have a handy dandy chart and\n\n374\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:19.080\nI don't wanna pull it up from my phone to\nsee what it is I'm gonna type in 5/16.\n\n375\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.250\nThat's the fraction for that.\n\n376\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.070\nWhen I hit tab, it automatically\ndoes that conversion for me.\n\n377\n00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.830\nSo again, that's anywhere you put a value.\n\n378\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:30.360\nSo if you know you need to increase\nthe size of your page by 3 and 3 quarters\n\n379\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.290\ninches, you can actually put all that into\nthe value box and it does that for you.\n\n380\n00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.830\nJust another time-saving tip.\n\n381\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.108\nBut you'll use that all the time.\n\n382\n00:18:38.108 --> 00:18:42.050\nNow bleeding slug, you may or may not use,\nif you don't know what a slug is,\n\n383\n00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.760\nam gonna say you're not gonna need it\nbecause if you don't know what it is,\n\n384\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.895\nyou're not gonna need it.\n\n385\n00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:50.200\nSlug is just where you put some\ninformation off in the margin a little bit\n\n386\n00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.050\nthat may or may not print with the job and\nget cut off later.\n\n387\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.451\nSometimes it's a place where the client\ncan sign of that the proof looks okay.\n\n388\n00:18:56.451 --> 00:18:59.060\nI rarely use slugs anymore\n\n389\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.120\nsince everything's pretty digital I\ndon't hardly ever use that at all.\n\n390\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.850\nBut bleed you're probably gonna use.\n\n391\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:08.320\nAnd bleed is the amount of\nimage that comes off a page.\n\n392\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.197\nSo when you want to print, let's say you\nwant a photo that comes all the way to\n\n393\n00:19:12.197 --> 00:19:16.135\nthe edge of a page, you can't print all\nthe way to the edge of the page either on\n\n394\n00:19:16.135 --> 00:19:20.254\nthe printing press or on a digital copier\nbecause at some point that machine has to\n\n395\n00:19:20.254 --> 00:19:22.581\ngrab that piece of paper and\npull it through.\n\n396\n00:19:22.581 --> 00:19:26.516\nNow if you're going digital and you want\nyour photo to come to the edge of the page\n\n397\n00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:29.610\nyou could just put your photo\nright to the edge of the page.\n\n398\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.330\nI still use the bleed because you\ncould just shift it ever so slightly,\n\n399\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.850\neven if a pixel got shifted, you'd have\nthat strip of white down the side and\n\n400\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.670\nthat is just kind of annoying to me.\n\n401\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.710\nAgain, that's a personal preference.\n\n402\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.870\nBut the bleed is how much past\nthe page that image needs to come.\n\n403\n00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.650\nAnd the reason why we wanna set it up is\nso that we can make sure that when we put\n\n404\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.580\na photo on the page, we actually have\nthe photo go to that spot, on that page.\n\n405\n00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.080\nSo, for\nme I'm gonna put an eighth of an inch.\n\n406\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.770\nSo, I'll just put that in there,\nmake all settings the same.\n\n407\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.130\nSlug if I needed it,\nturn my preview on so I can see it.\n\n408\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.670\nAnd I'm gonna go back and\nmake a couple changes really quick,\n\n409\n00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.800\nwe're gonna look at the,\nactually let's save this first.\n\n410\n00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.080\nI'm gonna save it first and\nthen we'll make some changes and\n\n411\n00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.990\nlook at the other options that\nare available with web and mobile.\n\n412\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.050\nSo you notice that this changed\nfrom default to custom.\n\n413\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.190\nAs soon as we put our own\nmeasurements in there, it changed.\n\n414\n00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.100\nSo let's go ahead and save it.\n\n415\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.760\nThat's what this little icon here is.\n\n416\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.910\nIt used to look like a little floppy.\n\n417\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:20.830\nNow it looks like a hard drive,\n\n418\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.110\nwhich is crazy cuz we all\nsave to the cloud now anyway.\n\n419\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.400\nSo, they're gonna have to\nupdate that icon at some point.\n\n420\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.344\nBut what I'm gonna do is click on that,\nand\n\n421\n00:20:27.344 --> 00:20:29.230\nit's gonna ask me to save it with a name?\n\n422\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.750\nDocument preset.\n\n423\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.470\nWe'll call this Letter,\nI'll call it Letter New,\n\n424\n00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.310\nbecause I already have one called Letter.\n\n425\n00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.070\nSo give it a name.\n\n426\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.320\nLetter, postcards.\n\n427\n00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.440\nCall it Client Name, if it's client's\nspecialized mailing piece or whatever.\n\n428\n00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.930\nGive it something that you can remember.\n\n429\n00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.270\nAnd I save everything I put in here.\n\n430\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.210\nEven if I never use it,\nI can always go back and\n\n431\n00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.760\ndelete it if I realize I've\nnever used that preset again.\n\n432\n00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.640\nBut for me, the worst thing would\nbe to lay it out, get it ready and\n\n433\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.180\nbe like,\nI really like that I wanna use that again.\n\n434\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:57.920\nI didn't save it.\n\n435\n00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.540\nSo, now I got to find that file,\nopen it and\n\n436\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.520\nlook at the measurements that are there.\n\n437\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.350\n>> It really does seem like these\npresets Erica that you're showing\n\n438\n00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.001\nus make it efficient, you know that.\n\n439\n00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:07.985\n>> I know.\n>> You don't have to\n\n440\n00:21:07.985 --> 00:21:08.680\ndefine it all the time.\n\n441\n00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.606\nI'm an administrator and\none of the things we love is our scripts.\n\n442\n00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:13.293\nMaking things a little bit easier.\n\n443\n00:21:13.293 --> 00:21:13.863\n>> Yes.\n>> So\n\n444\n00:21:13.863 --> 00:21:15.701\nthese presets look like\nthey'll come in handy, and\n\n445\n00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:17.630\ndefinitely save you a lot\nof time down the road.\n\n446\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.910\n>> Absolutely, and not only a lot of time,\nwhich is great, but again consistency.\n\n447\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.310\nBecause you think it's no big deal.\n\n448\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.980\nI did that six moths ago and\nit's a little different so what.\n\n449\n00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.310\nThen you go to your trade show,\nyour annual trade show and\n\n450\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.770\nyou show up in all your stuffs is on the\ntable side by side at the same time and\n\n451\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.900\nyou realize each one\nlooks a little different.\n\n452\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.730\nSo any time InDesign gives you a choice\nof saving a preset or a preference.\n\n453\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.854\nSo you don't have to do it again I have\na little saying that I like to say,\n\n454\n00:21:42.854 --> 00:21:44.220\nif I can train a monkey to do it.\n\n455\n00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.890\nThere's probably a way\nto automate it InDesign.\n\n456\n00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.538\nI don't have a trained monkey but\nI do know where all the presets and\n\n457\n00:21:49.538 --> 00:21:51.300\nthe preferences are that can do that for\nme.\n\n458\n00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.307\nSo, let us go ahead and save that,\nand new already exist look at that,\n\n459\n00:21:55.307 --> 00:21:57.564\nI'm gonna have to call it Letter New 2.\n\n460\n00:21:57.564 --> 00:21:59.880\nI thought I got rid of all\nmy other ones that are here.\n\n461\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.930\nYou should see the crazy\nones I come up with.\n\n462\n00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.700\nSo, I have got that saved and\nnow I can say okay Create.\n\n463\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.260\nThere's my new document.\n\n464\n00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.480\nBut when I go to do a new document,\nI can pull that down again.\n\n465\n00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.660\nHere's my Letter New 2 that we just did,\nand I can say OK.\n\n466\n00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.070\nI don't even need to look at everything.\n\n467\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.640\nI know it's right.\n\n468\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.873\nWe already set that up and\nI'm ready to go.\n\n469\n00:22:17.873 --> 00:22:21.400\nQuickly, I'm gonna jump in here and\njust show you some of the other options.\n\n470\n00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:27.880\nSo let's say we wanna do Web, so when I\ndo Web my page sizes are now pixel sizes.\n\n471\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.510\nSo, common screen sizes although I\nsay common but they're kind of old.\n\n472\n00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.120\nIf you notice they're not\nvery high resolution.\n\n473\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.330\nSo, I have one actually here\nas preset that I called\n\n474\n00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.230\nWeb Old School because it's 800 by 600.\n\n475\n00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.200\nI have my margins in here.\n\n476\n00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.180\nNow you noticed, it says pixels.\n\n477\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.530\nSee now we're working with pixels and\n\n478\n00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.640\nnot interest cuz it knows\nwe're going to the web.\n\n479\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.320\nSame thing with mobile\nwhen I choose mobile my\n\n480\n00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.460\npage sizes are things like iPhone now.\n\n481\n00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.920\nThese are new, this is nice.\n\n482\n00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.060\niPhone 6 plus is actually in here,\niPad Retina was not in here for\n\n483\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:03.120\nthe longest time, iPad is 1024768\nthat is the resolution of an iPad.\n\n484\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.020\nHowever, iPad Retina\nis exactly twice that.\n\n485\n00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.280\nBut remember when I said\nInDesign does math?\n\n486\n00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.550\nLet's go to the iPad version.\n\n487\n00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:15.090\nI can just go times or\nthe asterisk, the star 2 and\n\n488\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.840\nthat's how I get my double because\nthe Retina is double resolution.\n\n489\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.470\nSo that's why I do it, but\n\n490\n00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.950\nnow it's nice because they\nactually have it in there for me.\n\n491\n00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:26.606\nSo again, depending on what it is\nwe choose that measurement changes.\n\n492\n00:23:26.606 --> 00:23:29.630\nSo I'm gonna say can't,\nactually let's open up that letter so\n\n493\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.148\nwe have a nice letter file here.\n\n494\n00:23:31.148 --> 00:23:33.704\nAnd then I wanna turn on my preview.\n\n495\n00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:35.789\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo a keyboard shortcut.\n\n496\n00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:37.748\nI'm gonna show you where\nthat lives in just a second.\n\n497\n00:23:37.748 --> 00:23:39.848\nBut I wanna show you\nwhat we got with that.\n\n498\n00:23:39.848 --> 00:23:41.453\nSo up here we have some margins.\n\n499\n00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:46.610\nWe have the black line is the outline\nof the page, the red line is the bleed.\n\n500\n00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.560\nThat's where we would\nhave to have images go to\n\n501\n00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.620\nif we want them to bleed off the page.\n\n502\n00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.180\nNow when we're printing a bleed, that\nmeans we have to print on larger paper.\n\n503\n00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.800\nWhen I said you can't print to the edge of\nthe paper, we print larger and come back\n\n504\n00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.849\nand trim that off, but we need to make\nsure we pull everything out to the bleed.\n\n505\n00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.220\nThe purple is the margin, so\nwe don't want anything to go pass that.\n\n506\n00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.640\nEven if we're doing a bleed, we don't\nwant text to sit too close to the edge.\n\n507\n00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.920\nBecause there's always that chance that\nif you're printing it it can be cut\n\n508\n00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.640\ncrooked and it'll be very noticeable.\n\n509\n00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.800\nSo you wanna give yourself that\nbreathing room that's there.\n\n510\n00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.900\nAnd I did wanna show you how to\nchange the measurements as well.\n\n511\n00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.530\nBecause I said it's\nautomatically picas and points.\n\n512\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.990\nSo I'm gonna come in here, and\nI'm gonna go into my preferences.\n\n513\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.409\nAnd I'm gonna do Cmd or Ctrl+K,\nwhich brings up my preferences.\n\n514\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:34.770\nOr they also live in the menu,\nI'm do InDesign on a Mac and\n\n515\n00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.740\nPreferences, on a PC it's under\nthe Edit menu > Preferences.\n\n516\n00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.533\nGot see the same place, and I'm gonna\ncome down to units and increments.\n\n517\n00:24:42.533 --> 00:24:46.520\nAnd over here on my horizontal and\nvertical ruler, I have inches.\n\n518\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.820\nSo it will say, I believe it's points,\nit might be picas, I can't remember.\n\n519\n00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.079\nBut it's definitely not inches or\ncentimeters.\n\n520\n00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:56.265\nSo change it to what you want,\nchange it on both your rulers there, and\n\n521\n00:24:56.265 --> 00:24:57.470\nwe'll say OK.\n\n522\n00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.330\nThe cool thing is though,\n\n523\n00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.000\neven when I'm working in a value box\nwhether it's a new item or whatever.\n\n524\n00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.390\nI can always put in different value, a\ndifferent unit and have it convert for me.\n\n525\n00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.040\nIf I know it's 25 centimeters\nI can do 25cm and when I\n\n526\n00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:16.300\nhit tab it will convert it to inches which\nis what I have set up for my preferences.\n\n527\n00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.735\nSo InDesign's very flexible in that way.\n\n528\n00:25:18.735 --> 00:25:23.450\nLet's look at Tools really quickly, we\nare gonna look at just a couple of tools.\n\n529\n00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.287\nAnd as we go through the different\nepisodes and when we start working\n\n530\n00:25:26.287 --> 00:25:29.199\nthe different functions,\nwe'll actually look at specific tools.\n\n531\n00:25:29.199 --> 00:25:30.932\nBut there is a couple that\nI want you to get used to.\n\n532\n00:25:30.932 --> 00:25:33.890\nI'm gonna come over here\nto this Tools panel.\n\n533\n00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.470\nSo we got panels everywhere, we are gonna\ntalk about that in an upcoming episode.\n\n534\n00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.640\nSo this panel here, I'm gonna go over\nto this little double headed arrow,\n\n535\n00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.900\nhopefully you can see that.\n\n536\n00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.250\nAnd click on that, and it puts it in\na double column, that's how I like it.\n\n537\n00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.613\nYou can leave it in the single\ncolumn if you like, but\n\n538\n00:25:47.613 --> 00:25:49.244\nI'm gonna actually tear this off.\n\n539\n00:25:49.244 --> 00:25:53.540\nI'm gonna grab this top handle and\npull it over, and just float it.\n\n540\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.560\nSo just so we can see it just a little\nmore centralized on our page.\n\n541\n00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.480\nAnd I'm gonna zoom in, and\nI have two arrow keys, why?\n\n542\n00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.970\nWhy do I have two arrow keys?\n\n543\n00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:03.980\nWell they have different names.\n\n544\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.121\nI have the Selection Tool, which is\nthe solid tool or the black arrow, however\n\n545\n00:26:08.121 --> 00:26:12.661\nyou wanna call that, sounds like a great\nsuperhero name, but it's probably taken.\n\n546\n00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:15.946\nSo I can come over here to the direct\nSelection Tool which is the hollow one or\n\n547\n00:26:15.946 --> 00:26:16.748\nthe white arrow.\n\n548\n00:26:16.748 --> 00:26:20.760\nAnd we're gonna see how those two work,\nbut basically the solid one,\n\n549\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.590\nthe Selection Tool, is when we're working\nwith containers or what we call frames.\n\n550\n00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.091\nEverything sits in a frame in InDesign,\nor a container.\n\n551\n00:26:28.091 --> 00:26:31.032\nAnd when I wanna manipulate or\nwork with or move the frame,\n\n552\n00:26:31.032 --> 00:26:32.368\nI use the Selection Tool.\n\n553\n00:26:32.368 --> 00:26:37.090\nWhen I wanna work with the content of that\nframe, I use the Direct Selection Tool.\n\n554\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.177\nAnd again this will all become clear\nas we start working with elements, but\n\n555\n00:26:40.177 --> 00:26:41.462\njust kind of keep that in mind.\n\n556\n00:26:41.462 --> 00:26:45.158\nInDesign's also smart enough that it\nswitches between the two depending on what\n\n557\n00:26:45.158 --> 00:26:45.928\nyou're doing.\n\n558\n00:26:45.928 --> 00:26:47.150\nIt get's smarter every time.\n\n559\n00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.610\nI don't know if that's a good thing or\na bad thing.\n\n560\n00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.460\nIt's a little scary.\n\n561\n00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.320\nWe also have the Type Tool.\n\n562\n00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.408\nWhenever we work with type or\ntext we're gonna use this tool.\n\n563\n00:26:54.408 --> 00:26:57.340\nWe're also gonna use it when we\nwork with tables which is type.\n\n564\n00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.954\nSo just keep that in mind,\nwe're gonna switch to that one a lot.\n\n565\n00:26:59.954 --> 00:27:02.927\nAnd if you notice it when I roll over it,\nnot only does it tell me the name, but\n\n566\n00:27:02.927 --> 00:27:05.050\nit also has that V,\nthat is the keyboard shortcut.\n\n567\n00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.555\nV and this one is A and\nthe Type Tool is T.\n\n568\n00:27:07.555 --> 00:27:09.767\nNow, I don't use those\nshortcuts very often,\n\n569\n00:27:09.767 --> 00:27:12.040\nmostly because they're\njust single letters.\n\n570\n00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.670\nIt's not option or alt or anything\nlike that, it's just the letter V.\n\n571\n00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.670\nIf you are sitting with your\ncursor in a text frame and\n\n572\n00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:23.490\nyou try to use the keyboard shortcut V,\nyou will just type V into your text frame.\n\n573\n00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.145\nAnd there are som other steps you can do\nto override that, that's too many steps.\n\n574\n00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:29.740\nI just go up to the Tool panel and\nclick on the tool that I want.\n\n575\n00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.792\nAlso, you might notice that under the T\nand some of these other ones, I've got\n\n576\n00:27:34.792 --> 00:27:38.846\nthis little black triangle and that's a\ndisclosure triangle usually twirl it down.\n\n577\n00:27:38.846 --> 00:27:41.349\nSo if you ever see a triangle and\nyou click on it, twirls down and\n\n578\n00:27:41.349 --> 00:27:43.020\ngives you more information.\n\n579\n00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.220\nThis actually shows you more tools,\nthey're hidden tools.\n\n580\n00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:46.850\nSo when I click and\n\n581\n00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.140\nhold on it, I can see that there\nare other tools hidden underneath there.\n\n582\n00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.325\nSo compared to my little,\nmy Pencil Tool here.\n\n583\n00:27:52.325 --> 00:27:55.280\nAnd I look and I've got some other\ndrawing tools underneath it.\n\n584\n00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.212\nI can also select the tool and\noption or alt, click on that and\n\n585\n00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:02.739\nit will scroll through maybe.\n\n586\n00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:06.070\nOption, and click on that, here we go.\n\n587\n00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.070\nSo I can scroll through the tools that\nway if I don't wanna click and hold.\n\n588\n00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.750\nThat just shows you that\nthere's some hidden tools.\n\n589\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.780\nAnd the last little tool at\nthe bottom that I wanna show you,\n\n590\n00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.980\nthe last little selections,\nare your preview modes.\n\n591\n00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.180\nSo when I first created that document,\nwe just had a blank page and\n\n592\n00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.650\nI couldn't see any of the margins or\nthe guides.\n\n593\n00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.640\nAnd I did that,\njust W was the keyboard shortcut for that.\n\n594\n00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.022\nI knew I didn't have any text frames so\nI knew I was okay,\n\n595\n00:28:28.022 --> 00:28:30.531\nI wasn't just gonna type w\n18 times because that's me.\n\n596\n00:28:30.531 --> 00:28:35.366\nI'd have my cursor on page 52 and type in\nw frantically to try to change the view\n\n597\n00:28:35.366 --> 00:28:37.979\nmode and I just typed in through page 52.\n\n598\n00:28:37.979 --> 00:28:38.855\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n599\n00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:42.630\nSo the default display that's there,\n\n600\n00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.750\nis just the normal display,\nthat shows everything.\n\n601\n00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.850\nAll your guides,\neverything that kinda behind the scenes.\n\n602\n00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.530\nWe've got the bleed, the margin.\n\n603\n00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:53.760\nIf we have items set to not print,\nbut we need to see where they are,\n\n604\n00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.143\nwe'll have those on the page,\nwe'll see that.\n\n605\n00:28:56.143 --> 00:28:58.590\nWe'll also see what's\ncalled the pasteboard,\n\n606\n00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.640\nthis gray area off to the side,\nand so we can see everything.\n\n607\n00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.630\nIf we've thrown things off to the side\nof the page, we can see it as well.\n\n608\n00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.290\nBut sometimes we wanna look at it how it's\nactually gonna look when it prints or\n\n609\n00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:09.840\nexports to PDF.\n\n610\n00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.720\nSo when I come here and hit the second\noption and that's Preview mode.\n\n611\n00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.080\nSo when I click that you notice that\nboth of the are W it's a toggle.\n\n612\n00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.800\nSo if I hit W it turns to preview back and\nfourth back and fourth.\n\n613\n00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:27.912\nSo that's just shows me everything\nhow it's going to look.\n\n614\n00:29:27.912 --> 00:29:30.138\nSo the guides go away, non-printing items,\n\n615\n00:29:30.138 --> 00:29:32.430\nanything that's off my\npaste board goes away.\n\n616\n00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.780\nIt's still there, we just can't see it.\n\n617\n00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.930\nSo I can do that, but I've got\na couple other ones hidden underneath.\n\n618\n00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:42.340\nI've got one called Bleed, that shows\nme the document with that bleed amount.\n\n619\n00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.070\nSo there is that quarter inch or whatever,\neighth of an inch that we had for a bleed.\n\n620\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.550\nAnd that's really good because\nif I do set up a bleed, and\n\n621\n00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.840\nI've pulled the images to the bleed.\n\n622\n00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.523\nI also wanna make sure\nthat it goes to the bleed.\n\n623\n00:29:53.523 --> 00:29:57.017\nI can't tell you how many times that\npeople have worked in design for\n\n624\n00:29:57.017 --> 00:29:58.441\n30 years sending files.\n\n625\n00:29:58.441 --> 00:29:59.881\nAnd they set up for a bleed, and\n\n626\n00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:03.160\nthey've only given me enough picture\nto go to the edge of the page.\n\n627\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.330\nI need that extra bit.\n\n628\n00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.480\nAgain, if it's being printed so\n\n629\n00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:12.290\nthat as it might waiver going through the\nprinting process or the cutting operation,\n\n630\n00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.550\nthat I have a little bit of extra\nwiggle room for that image.\n\n631\n00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.320\nBut this gives me a way to visually make\nsure, it's called pulling out your bleeds.\n\n632\n00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.920\nI make sure that I've pulled\neverything out to the bleed.\n\n633\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.350\nI can also do the same for\nslug if I have a slug setup,\n\n634\n00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.760\nwe did not have a slug\nsetup in this document.\n\n635\n00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.179\nAnd then also, one that they\nintroduced in I think it was CS6.\n\n636\n00:30:29.179 --> 00:30:33.060\nSo if you're on CS6 you should have this,\nis called presentation mode.\n\n637\n00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.810\nAnd that get's rid of everything,\nall your tools, everything, and\n\n638\n00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.880\nyou're basically just focused on the page.\n\n639\n00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.660\nThis is great if you just wanna scroll\nthrough and see your documents.\n\n640\n00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.010\nHow it's laid out, I can use the up and\ndown arrow keys to scroll for\n\n641\n00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:45.760\neach of those.\n\n642\n00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.790\nNow the background is black, you can\nchange that with a keyboard shortcut.\n\n643\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:54.170\nIf I do G I get gray, B brings me\nback to black, and W gives me white.\n\n644\n00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.600\nSo I can keep scrolling through those\ntil it gives me the look I want, and\n\n645\n00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.140\nI hit the Esc key when I'm done, and\nit brings me right back into in design.\n\n646\n00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.350\nSo that's just via first part,\nhow to get started,\n\n647\n00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:08.480\nhow to kinda get a document set up.\n\n648\n00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.965\nCouple of the tools get\nus familiar with that.\n\n649\n00:31:10.965 --> 00:31:12.080\nComing up episode,\n\n650\n00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.760\nwe're gonna actually talk about what all\nthis stuff is that's on our desktop here.\n\n651\n00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.600\nIt'll look Adobe workspace environment is.\n\n652\n00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.540\nSo I think we're good,\nwe're gonna stop there I think.\n\n653\n00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.093\n>> That sounds great,\nthat sounds like a real foundation.\n\n654\n00:31:26.093 --> 00:31:28.415\nAnd if any of this is new to you,\nmake sure that you go back and\n\n655\n00:31:28.415 --> 00:31:31.054\nlisten to Erica and some of the tips\nthat she's already provided.\n\n656\n00:31:31.054 --> 00:31:34.190\nErica does look like we're flexion\nmuscles of the clock over there, but\n\n657\n00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.280\nbefore we sign out,\ndo you have any addition words or\n\n658\n00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.370\ndo you wanna save that for\nthe next episode?\n\n659\n00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.940\n>> I think we'll save it, and we'll\njust jump right in with that next one.\n\n660\n00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:45.378\n>> That sounds good, well signing out for\nITPro.TV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n661\n00:31:45.378 --> 00:31:46.431\n>> And I'm Erica Gamet.\n\n662\n00:31:46.431 --> 00:31:47.419\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n663\n00:31:47.419 --> 00:31:54.438\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.953\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through our\n\n4\n00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.910\nseries in the Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.482\nSpecifically we're focusing on InDesign.\n\n6\n00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:27.837\nJoining me in the studios\ntoday is Erica Camden.\n\n7\n00:00:27.837 --> 00:00:28.462\nHow you doing, Erika?\n\n8\n00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:29.809\n>> Pretty good, Wes, thanks.\n\n9\n00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.608\n>> Looking good, so what are we\nlooking at in this episode today?\n\n10\n00:00:32.608 --> 00:00:36.180\n>> This episode we're gonna start\nlooking at the Adobe workspace.\n\n11\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.448\nSo basically the environment that we\nlive when we're working in InDesign.\n\n12\n00:00:40.448 --> 00:00:41.690\nSo we're gonna get comfortable with\n\n13\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.940\nsome of the things we saw\nin a previous episode.\n\n14\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.706\nWe looked at all these panels so\nwe're gonna start making sense of those.\n\n15\n00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:52.270\nI'm gonna ahead and\njump back into InDesign and\n\n16\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.260\nwhen we launched InDesign or\nwhen we launched in actual document.\n\n17\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.430\nNow, double click on document to open it.\n\n18\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.310\nIf the document is there\nwe would see that but\n\n19\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.950\nright now,\nlet's just say we just launched InDesign.\n\n20\n00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.540\nWe're gonna have this thing staring us in\nthe face, what is this, a big gray square,\n\n21\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.530\nthat's what that is with stuff, right?\n\n22\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.550\nSo, let's start making\nsense to some of the stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.670\nSo, the first thing I wanna do is I wanna\nchange things and make it work for me.\n\n24\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.110\nSo, there's got to be a lot\nof preferences in this.\n\n25\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.080\nSo don't copy what it is\nthat I do necessarily,\n\n26\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.560\nkinda look at what it is I'm achieving and\nthen make your own choices from there.\n\n27\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.600\nBecause, like I said, it's preferences and\nthat is so that it works for you.\n\n28\n00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.630\nThat is the whole point of all this\ncustomization of the workspace and\n\n29\n00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.190\npreferences.\n\n30\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.683\nSo that it works f or you, so by default,\nit's hard to say by default because these\n\n31\n00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:43.263\nnew versions come out so fast and furious\nand the defaults change from time to time.\n\n32\n00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:46.429\nIn fact I'd like to play a little\ngame what defaults have changed and\n\n33\n00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.820\nalso where the Adobe has hidden my panels.\n\n34\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.840\nBecause in the menus,\n\n35\n00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.640\nthey move the panels around and regroup\nthem in sub groups as we get more and\n\n36\n00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.740\nmore panels to choose from, they have\nto start putting them in sub menus.\n\n37\n00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.690\nAnd sometimes trying to find where\nthose are is a bit of a challenge.\n\n38\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.800\nSo don't freak out if your version\ndoesn't look exactly like mine,\n\n39\n00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.410\nbecause I'm gonna set it up\nto my preferences anyway.\n\n40\n00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.780\nSo in a few minutes mine isn't\ngonna look like any of yours.\n\n41\n00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.310\nIs because I'm gonna set its\nup exactly how I want to.\n\n42\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.300\nBut when we first launch it what we\nprobably see is a workspace up here called\n\n43\n00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.000\nEssentials, that may or\nmay not be the one that you see, but\n\n44\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.880\nyou'll have a name up there and we'll\ntalk about workspaces in just a minute.\n\n45\n00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.950\nAnd like I said we have this big\ngrey space, this is sort of the,\n\n46\n00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.370\nI don't even know if there's\nan actual name for it, but\n\n47\n00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.890\nI just call it the Adobe workspace,\nthis is where I start putting in InDesign.\n\n48\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.660\nOver on the left side\nwe have a tool panel,\n\n49\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.208\nand we have some panels on\nthe right side as well.\n\n50\n00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:38.130\nAnd we're gonna talk about all the panels\nand how to arrange those in just a second.\n\n51\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.040\nWe're gonna start with the tool panel,\n\n52\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.120\nup in the upper left there's this double\narrow, and I'm gonna click on that, and\n\n53\n00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.040\nthat will put it so\nthat it's in two columns.\n\n54\n00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.500\nYou can also click it again and\n\n55\n00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.600\nyou can actually get the single\none that way as well.\n\n56\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.720\nSo however it is you'd\nlike to see your tools,\n\n57\n00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.740\nI just find that that makes\nthe icons too small for me.\n\n58\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.610\nAnd I've had it that way for\nmany, many years and\n\n59\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.640\nso I just like to put\nit back the way it is.\n\n60\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.400\nSo I can see all my tools there.\n\n61\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.100\nSo that's my Tools panel.\n\n62\n00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.959\nIf I want to pull that off, I can, I can\nactually grab this grey bar at the top.\n\n63\n00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.690\nAnywhere in the grey bar and just pull it,\nand it automatically comes off.\n\n64\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.210\nAnd when I do that, you see on the left\nside, my space, my workspace or\n\n65\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.250\nwhat's called the application frame,\nwe're gonna look at in a second, expanded.\n\n66\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.810\nSo it says, you need more room to work so\nmoving the panels off and\n\n67\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.200\naround actually expands your work space\nas well, so just keep that in mind.\n\n68\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.170\nI'm gonna grab this and\nbring it right back.\n\n69\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.100\nIf it ever disappears,\nI'm gonna click on this little x and\n\n70\n00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.780\nthat will make it disappear.\n\n71\n00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.410\nIf it's ever just gone for some reason,\nyou can always bring it back.\n\n72\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.020\nAlmost all of your panels\nlive under the Window menu.\n\n73\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.290\nSo up here at the top your Window menu,\n\n74\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.930\nyou're not going to have these\ntwo extra menus that are here.\n\n75\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.930\nThese are some extra\nitems that I've added.\n\n76\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.700\nSo just keep that in mind that your Menus\n\n77\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.000\nmay look though may be fewer of\nyours than there are of mine.\n\n78\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.900\nAs you add specialized tools,\nlittle helpers,\n\n79\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.160\nI'm always talking about how to\nget your work done quicker and\n\n80\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.470\nmore efficiently, you might find\nthat you end up with extra menus.\n\n81\n00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.770\nBut the window menu will always be there.\n\n82\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.530\nUp under the Window menu,\nthis is where most of your panels live so\n\n83\n00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.020\nI wanna bring back my Tool\npanel that disappeared.\n\n84\n00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.080\nSo I'm just gonna come down to\nthe tools menu, and choose that.\n\n85\n00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.130\nAnd it's gonna put it back where I had it,\nbut I want to dock it back, so\n\n86\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.230\nthat's docking a panel.\n\n87\n00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.180\nI want to grab it by the bar, and just\nmove it over to the side, and hopefully\n\n88\n00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.490\nyou can see that there's a little bit\nof a blue bar that appears over there.\n\n89\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.370\nThat just means,\nis that where you wanna dock it?\n\n90\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.410\nYes it is, I wanna put that there.\n\n91\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.650\nAnd this one at the top,\n\n92\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.110\nthere's a lot of stuff at the top, that's\nactually an individual panel as well.\n\n93\n00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.750\nThat's called the control panel.\n\n94\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.070\nAnd what the control panel does\nis it duplicates other panels.\n\n95\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.650\nSounds like it's not very helpful but\nit actually is, it's a contextual panel.\n\n96\n00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.470\nSo that means if I select\nsomething like the Type tool,\n\n97\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.980\nwhen I select it, the top control\npanel changes to all the text items.\n\n98\n00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.220\nIn fact, it basically combines your\ncharacter panel and your paragraph panel.\n\n99\n00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.860\nNow, I will look at those\npanels individually and\n\n100\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.970\nwhat they do in the future episode but\nit puts everything up at the top.\n\n101\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.090\nSo, I don't have to go and\nfetch all this panels every time.\n\n102\n00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.150\nI can but I don't need to,\nif I change it to the direction,\n\n103\n00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.530\nI'm sorry the selection tool,\nthe direction tool.\n\n104\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.610\nSelection tool and\nthe direct selection tool.\n\n105\n00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.240\nWhen I change it to those it contextualize\nto the top it changes as well.\n\n106\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.580\nSo, again, as I change and\n\n107\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.880\nselect different tools,\nthat control panel changes.\n\n108\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.560\nI can turn that on and\noff as well, that's on by default.\n\n109\n00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.700\nSo the control panel is there.\n\n110\n00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.310\nI can also dock that control\npanel somewhere else.\n\n111\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.080\nInstead of at the top, I can grab this\nlittle gray handle that's over here.\n\n112\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.888\nSome of these little things,\nthey don't make any sense.\n\n113\n00:05:34.888 --> 00:05:37.860\nI like just to click on things and\ndrag and mess things up and\n\n114\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.570\nsee where they are, what they do.\n\n115\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.770\nBecause sometimes the little icons\ndon't make a whole lot of sense.\n\n116\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.120\nBut I can grab that and I can float that.\n\n117\n00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.580\nSo now I have this floating panel,\n\n118\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.920\nnotice I've got a little bit\nmore space at the top as well.\n\n119\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.450\nSo it's always making sure I'm\nusing my entire screen real estate.\n\n120\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.010\nI can also bring this down to the bottom.\n\n121\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.040\nNow, as a Mac user I don't want\nto dock that at the bottom,\n\n122\n00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.760\nbecause if I try to get to it I'm\ngoing to run into my Mac dock, so\n\n123\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.580\nthat doesn't work very well for me at all.\n\n124\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.270\nSo I'm gonna grab that, pull it off and\n\n125\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.980\ndrag it back up to the top till I get\nthat little blue line at the top and\n\n126\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.330\nthat shows me it's gonna dock it in there,\nkind of wedge it in there.\n\n127\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.370\nSo that's the control panel.\n\n128\n00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.200\nThe other thing,\n\n129\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.696\nif we go up under the window menu down\nat the bottom I have these two options.\n\n130\n00:06:16.696 --> 00:06:19.217\nOne's greyed out,\nthe application frame, so\n\n131\n00:06:19.217 --> 00:06:23.567\nthis is something that was introduced\nseveral versions ago, and what it does is,\n\n132\n00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:26.360\njust gives us that,\nI think of it almost as a tray.\n\n133\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.490\nSo I can always work in,\nput my items on top of that tray, and\n\n134\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.580\nwhether it's my panels, when I move a\npanel out, and it expanded it, it's kinda\n\n135\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.840\nlike now I have more room in that tray\nto work, so, by default, that's on.\n\n136\n00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.590\nIf I turn that off, now I can see\nright through it to my desktop.\n\n137\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.310\nNow if you've been on the Mac for\nyears and\n\n138\n00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.460\nyears, this is what you're used to\nyour applications looking like.\n\n139\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.030\nWhen you open it up,\nyou could always see what was behind it.\n\n140\n00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.136\nIf you've been working on a PC forever,\nyou're actually used to it the other way.\n\n141\n00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:57.307\nAnd I can tell you when they first put\nthat into InDesign It freaked me out,\n\n142\n00:06:57.307 --> 00:07:00.140\nwhere's my desktop,\nwhy can't I just see what's behind.\n\n143\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.410\nI like to grab things from the desktop and\nbring them into InDesign,\n\n144\n00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.600\nwhy can't I do that?\n\n145\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.840\nWell you can, it just takes an extra step.\n\n146\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.300\nBut as we've seen as I move a panel in or\nout and it changes for\n\n147\n00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.620\nme, that to me makes it totally worth it.\n\n148\n00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.630\nThe other thing that I have underneath\nhere is the application bar.\n\n149\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.490\nNow, I can only turn it on or off when I'm\nnot working with an application frame.\n\n150\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.210\nSo now the application\nbar option is available.\n\n151\n00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.050\nWhen I turn that off it basically\njust turned off that top row.\n\n152\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.870\nAnd what that top row is,\n\n153\n00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.610\nis it just has things where I can jump\nout to my other applications like Bridge.\n\n154\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.290\nI can go to Bridge Right away.\n\n155\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.740\nI can play with the documents if\nI have multiple documents open,\n\n156\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.830\nI can rearrange them or\ntile them on there.\n\n157\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.380\nSo there's just some extra\noptions that I get for InDesign.\n\n158\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.630\nAnd I also have my workspace as well,\navailable to me right here,\n\n159\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.350\ninstead of having to go through a menu.\n\n160\n00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.420\nI generally leave that on, I generally\nleave the application frame on as well.\n\n161\n00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.230\nSo again, I have everything\nin this neat little package.\n\n162\n00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.156\nNow, other things that are on this tray,\nif you will, are these Panels.\n\n163\n00:07:59.156 --> 00:08:02.946\nNow the workspace is called essentials and\nwe're gonna look that there are several to\n\n164\n00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:06.360\nchoose from and we're gonna create\nour own in just a second as well.\n\n165\n00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.280\nAgain it's all about being proficient\nin your workflow, how you wanna work.\n\n166\n00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.200\nDon't worry about what I have or what the\nperson sitting next to you if you're in\n\n167\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.770\na group environment what they have,\nwork so that it makes sense to you.\n\n168\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.190\nWhen you go over to the panels\nare the ones you need\n\n169\n00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.260\nwith the other ones that you need, are\nthey grouped together in a logical manner.\n\n170\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.560\nDo you have a ton of\nthem that you never use?\n\n171\n00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.160\nWhy are they there?\n\n172\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.680\nTake them out of your way,\nyou can always get to them,\n\n173\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.150\nyou can always add them later.\n\n174\n00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.390\nBut if they're in your way and\n\n175\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.030\nyou're constantly trying to look through\nthe panels because you can't remember what\n\n176\n00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.020\nthe panel is or\nwhere it lives then get rid of it.\n\n177\n00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.770\nSo by default you can see the icons and\nthe names and\n\n178\n00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.900\nin the most, most recent version,\ndepending on when you're looking at it but\n\n179\n00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.870\nwhen I just updated to the version, one of\nthe things they did is they made the type\n\n180\n00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.840\nbigger on the panels because it's\nbeen getting smaller and smaller.\n\n181\n00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.220\nNow I realize my eyes are getting\nworse and worse, but it's not just me.\n\n182\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.790\nThe panel's type has been\ngetting smaller and smaller and\n\n183\n00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.400\nthey just made it bigger and\na little clearer.\n\n184\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.000\nThey changed the font which\nsounds like a little thing but\n\n185\n00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.480\nwhen you're looking at all these\npanels it really makes a difference,\n\n186\n00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.920\nespecially when you're looking at them\nin a list like they are right now.\n\n187\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.320\nI can grab right here, if I roll over,\nhopefully you can see that.\n\n188\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.620\nI'll turn on the zoom, although it\nnever changes the size of that,\n\n189\n00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.190\nlet's actually zoom in this way,\nwe can actually see the arrow changes.\n\n190\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.920\nSo it changes to that double arrow,\nI'm gonna zoom back in.\n\n191\n00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.840\nI always like to tell you when\nI'm zooming in and out so\n\n192\n00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.630\nwe don't get seasick,\nlook away if you need to.\n\n193\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.410\nBut I get that double arrow and then I can\nbasically change the size of the panel.\n\n194\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.680\nLike I can slide them in and\nout like that.\n\n195\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.940\nSo I can push it all\nthe way down to just icon.\n\n196\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.960\nSo again I have more room but for me,\nI don't know what half those icons mean.\n\n197\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.240\nAnd I've been staring at them for\n15 years, right?\n\n198\n00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.020\nBut for whatever reason,\nsome of them don't make sense to me.\n\n199\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.080\nSo even if I want to conserve space,\nmaybe I'm working on a lower resolution on\n\n200\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.260\nmy screen, and I need to be able\nto see as much as possible.\n\n201\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.220\nI might move this over just a little bit,\nso I've just enough so\n\n202\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.580\nI can kind of see what they are.\n\n203\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.750\nSo again, that's a preference,\ndo what you need to do and\n\n204\n00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.400\nthese are actual panel groups.\n\n205\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.680\nNow right now I'm seeing them in sort of\nthese buttons, so they almost look like\n\n206\n00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.120\nbuttons as I roll over one, and click on\nit the panel bursts out from the side.\n\n207\n00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.110\nNow it's not just that one panel,\nyou notice color and stroke both came with\n\n208\n00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.060\nit and that's because it's in the panel\ngroup, so those are nested together.\n\n209\n00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.380\nI'm gonna show you how to do\nthat in just a minute as well.\n\n210\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.270\nI can also view those as\ntabbed panels as well.\n\n211\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.140\nSo instead of these buttons, the buttons\nare nice and clean, just so you know,\n\n212\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.970\nI like that, but you might not want that.\n\n213\n00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.690\nI can come again to that double headed\narrow that's there and click on that.\n\n214\n00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.300\nAnd now I have all my tabs so\nI've still got my nested groups, but\n\n215\n00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.140\nit's a little harder, I think, to see.\n\n216\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.470\nBut again this might be what you want.\n\n217\n00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.650\nAnd the nice thing about this is that as\nI click on one or the other, everything\n\n218\n00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:46.610\nkind of changes in size, but I can see my\nswatches and my color at the same time.\n\n219\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.150\nIf I hit that double headed\narrow again and collapse those,\n\n220\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.720\nwhen I'm choosing color here or\nswatches, I can only see one at a time.\n\n221\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.260\nSo when I'm working in\nthe button mode it flies out but\n\n222\n00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.140\nwhen I select another one goes away.\n\n223\n00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.430\nSo just keep that in mind as well,\nhow does it make sense for you to work?\n\n224\n00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.740\nSo let's actually bring out\nsome more panels that are here.\n\n225\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.390\nSo I'm gonna go back to that Window menu,\nand I'm gonna choose one that I know isn't\n\n226\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.870\nhere, let's do Hyperlinks.\n\n227\n00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.120\nSo Hyperlinks, when I open up a panel,\n\n228\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.570\nI now have a panel just sitting there\nfloating, that's a floating panel.\n\n229\n00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:27.540\nI'm gonna open up one more, let's come\nin here to assignments, that's good.\n\n230\n00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.510\nSo now I have this other one.\n\n231\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.860\nI'm grabbing him by this\nlittle bar at the top,\n\n232\n00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.540\nagain that gray bar is\nkind where I grab it.\n\n233\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.640\nIf there's no icon don't hit an icon,\nthings will close or\n\n234\n00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.140\npanels will collapse or menus will pop-up.\n\n235\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.300\nSo I wanna make sure we grab this\nsort of in center and pull that.\n\n236\n00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.700\nSo I have these floating panel,\nwhich is nice,\n\n237\n00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.070\nexcept that if I have a document back\nbehind let's actually open up a new\n\n238\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:52.800\ndocument we use our whatever we set\nup in a previous episode there.\n\n239\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.760\nSo have that,\nyou can see it's kinda in the way.\n\n240\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.050\nI can kinda push them off to the side.\n\n241\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.560\nBut then if I blow up the page you\nwanna zoom in they might be in my way.\n\n242\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.930\nso, I might decide I want\nto group those together,\n\n243\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.070\nI've got a couple of\ndifferent ways to do that.\n\n244\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.390\nI can grab this panel here, and\n\n245\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.890\nI can bring it to the bottom of the other\npanel until I get, again, that blue line.\n\n246\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.920\nThat's what we're always looking for\nis a blue line or\n\n247\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.750\na blue square to indicate something\nis going to happen on those panels.\n\n248\n00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.870\nSo, I'm going to put that underneath and\nnow those are docked together.\n\n249\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.410\nSo I've docked them together,\n\n250\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:27.810\nI can do things like double-click\non the tab and it closes them up.\n\n251\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.674\nSo I can kind of shrink them up so\nthey're out of the way.\n\n252\n00:12:29.674 --> 00:12:34.440\nI'm gonna double-click to re-expand\nthose but I might want those actually,\n\n253\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.260\nmaybe I wanted hyperlinks to kind of\nbe in this group, that nested set.\n\n254\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.480\nSo I'm gonna grab this bar again,\nthat gray bar is still there,\n\n255\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.710\nit looks a little different once\nit's nested or docked, excuse me.\n\n256\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.250\nI can pull that out, and\nI can grab by the tab itself and\n\n257\n00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:52.790\ncome up here until I get the square\naround the entire panel that's there and\n\n258\n00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.010\ndrop that in and\nnow it's in this nested group.\n\n259\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.960\nNow I might want to move that nested\ngroup over to the list on the side,\n\n260\n00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.320\nand actually let me pull one back out.\n\n261\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.560\nThat's how I pull it out of a group,\njust grab it by the tab, pull it out.\n\n262\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.580\nIf I wanted to dock this over with\nthe group here I can grab by the tab and\n\n263\n00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.570\npull it over and\neither put it in one of these groups.\n\n264\n00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.600\nAgain these are nested groups, so\nStroking Colors is a nested group, Pages,\n\n265\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.920\nLayers and Links, Swatches and\nCC Libraries are together.\n\n266\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.040\nI can put it in the group or I can create\na whole new group down below here.\n\n267\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.550\nSo I can create that, and\nnow it sits all by itself.\n\n268\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.070\nSo you're gonna want to start grouping\nthese in things that make sense.\n\n269\n00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.310\nLike for instance, swatches and color,\nto me makes sense to be together.\n\n270\n00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.730\nSo I'm gonna grab swatches and\nmove that there.\n\n271\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.750\nSo stroke swatches and color makes a lot\nmore sense to me, that should be in\n\n272\n00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.230\na group, because maybe I do want to\npull it out to the side and use it so\n\n273\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.460\nI can see all three tabs at once but still\nkeep my buttons nice and neat over here.\n\n274\n00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.650\nSo if I wanted to move this whole entire\ngroup as a nested group into the side doc,\n\n275\n00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.650\nI wanna hold down the Option or the Alt\nkey on a PC and grab one of the tabs.\n\n276\n00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.260\nNow it moves as a group,\nif I don't have the Option key down\n\n277\n00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.030\nIt moves just that one tab,\nput that back, drop that back inside.\n\n278\n00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.250\nOption or alt, pull that and\nslide it over into the side.\n\n279\n00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.730\nWhen I do that, now I got my whole\nnew group over here on this side.\n\n280\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.170\nSo again,\nthis seems like a lot of work but\n\n281\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.460\nthe great thing is once I lay\nit all out I can save that.\n\n282\n00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.550\nSo I always have the same arrangements\nof panels and tabs, so let's do that.\n\n283\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.193\nThat's called a workspace and\nit's confusing we talk about the Adobe\n\n284\n00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:25.156\nworkspace it’s kind of a whole thing,\nhow everything looks on our screen.\n\n285\n00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:28.611\nBut in individual workspace is a way for\nus to switch and\n\n286\n00:14:28.611 --> 00:14:32.754\nonly show the panels that we want for\nwhatever it is we're doing.\n\n287\n00:14:32.754 --> 00:14:37.038\nNow that could be us individually,\nit could be like this is my work space and\n\n288\n00:14:37.038 --> 00:14:40.914\nmaybe I share a computer and\nsomebody else has their own work space or\n\n289\n00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:43.034\nit could be based on what it is you do.\n\n290\n00:14:43.034 --> 00:14:45.450\nFor instance,\nI work in tables a lot, and for\n\n291\n00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.756\nme there's a lot of different tabs\nthat we can have in tables or\n\n292\n00:14:48.756 --> 00:14:52.390\nmaybe working with something\nhigher end like data merger XML.\n\n293\n00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.370\nWhich we're not going to go into,\ncuz like I said,\n\n294\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.170\nthat's really in-depth\nadvanced sort of stuff.\n\n295\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.060\nBut if you're working with that, you got\na ton of panels you need to work with.\n\n296\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.750\nYou might have one turned on just for\nthat.\n\n297\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.120\nYou might have one that's\njust more image-based,\n\n298\n00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.290\nif you're working with images.\n\n299\n00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.244\nIf you're not working with images at all,\nmaybe take those out and\n\n300\n00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:12.639\njust have the ones that have to do a lot\nwith type, so again, whatever it is.\n\n301\n00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:16.145\nSo essentials is there by default,\nnow these in the middle here,\n\n302\n00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:19.932\nare here within design, so\nthere's one called interactive for PDF.\n\n303\n00:15:19.932 --> 00:15:24.462\nWhen I select that it switches you notice\nnow I've got a second row of panels here,\n\n304\n00:15:24.462 --> 00:15:27.088\nI've got the buttons and\nforms right here, for\n\n305\n00:15:27.088 --> 00:15:29.730\nwhatever reason that's\nhow Adobe set that up.\n\n306\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.540\nI might say well, that's dumb it's taking\nup more space, why don't I grab that and\n\n307\n00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.540\nmove it down here?\n\n308\n00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.400\nAgain, it gives me more space.\n\n309\n00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.940\nSo, that's just something\nthat was set up by Adobe.\n\n310\n00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.350\nIf you're working with advanced stuff,\ndigital publishing,\n\n311\n00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.690\nif you're working with just typography,\nit's going to be a lot of type stuff.\n\n312\n00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.656\nAgain, there's scripts and data merge,\nnot really sure why that's there but\n\n313\n00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.573\nthat might be something you need,\nit might not be.\n\n314\n00:15:50.573 --> 00:15:54.230\nBut the great thing is I can say well I\nlike that but I don't like data merge and\n\n315\n00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.643\nI don't like scripts, so\nlet's pull those out.\n\n316\n00:15:56.643 --> 00:15:59.226\nLet's click the little\nx to get rid of those.\n\n317\n00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:00.802\nAnd now that's perfect.\n\n318\n00:16:00.802 --> 00:16:02.010\nThat's typography.\n\n319\n00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.150\nNow this still shows is typography,\nbut it's still really not.\n\n320\n00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.040\nWhat I wanna do is say,\nI like this layout, let's save it.\n\n321\n00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.770\nSo I'm gonna go up to\nthe little work space menu and\n\n322\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.860\nI'm gonna choose New work space.\n\n323\n00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.340\nAnd I'm going to give it a name.\n\n324\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.005\nSo I might call this My Typography.\n\n325\n00:16:17.005 --> 00:16:19.520\nAnd so I know that that's mine.\n\n326\n00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.220\nIt's just set up a little differently.\n\n327\n00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.805\nAnd I can choose to show panel locations\nwhich is what we've just done.\n\n328\n00:16:24.805 --> 00:16:27.240\nLet's put everything\nexactly where we need it.\n\n329\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.050\nAnd also menu customization.\n\n330\n00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.108\nSo one of the preferences,\n\n331\n00:16:30.108 --> 00:16:33.180\nI'm not gonna go into this, we can change\nonly because there used to be a bug.\n\n332\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.740\nI don't even know if it's still\nthere cuz I don't go there anymore.\n\n333\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.010\nThat if I switched it and\nstarted colorizing menus and\n\n334\n00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:42.520\nthen I switched work space, those\ncolored menus sometime got left behind.\n\n335\n00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.085\nWhich just confused me.\n\n336\n00:16:44.085 --> 00:16:44.880\nSo I don't do that.\n\n337\n00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.260\nWe can actually change the color of menus.\n\n338\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.610\nIf there's one thing you can never find,\nyou can put it in a nice purple or\n\n339\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.600\nsomething so\nyou can find it easily in the menu.\n\n340\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.540\nI'm always losing things in the menu coz\nI learned the keyboard shortcuts and\n\n341\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.330\nI don't know where it actually\nlives sometimes in the menu.\n\n342\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.090\nSo it's a good tip.\n\n343\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.680\nSo I can choose to save that\nwith the workspace or not.\n\n344\n00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.050\nI can turn off and on those.\n\n345\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.040\nSo say okay that's my typography.\n\n346\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.150\nNow, as I am working maybe\nI get kind of crazy and\n\n347\n00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.960\nI start opening things and moving things\nand closing and then I realize, wow.\n\n348\n00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.850\nI've lost my character style panel.\n\n349\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:15.570\nWhere did that go?\n\n350\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.920\nI can either go back to\nthe Window menu and open it, or\n\n351\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.200\nI could just reset my workspace.\n\n352\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.090\nSo what I wanna do is come in here and\nchoose this.\n\n353\n00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.930\nNow keep in mind, if I went to something\nelse like Interactive for PDF.\n\n354\n00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.520\nI'll go to that.\n\n355\n00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.620\nI'll work in Interactive for PDF.\n\n356\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.470\nAnd I come back and I say,\nI want My Typography.\n\n357\n00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.430\nSo I come back to the My Typography,\nand it's at the top.\n\n358\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.440\nThose are our custom ones.\n\n359\n00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.080\nAnd I look and I'm like, yeah, but\nI'm still missing my character styles.\n\n360\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.330\nWell that's because it went back\nto the last state that it was in,\n\n361\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.300\nwhich is kind of a good thing if\nyou're switching back and forth.\n\n362\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.310\nBut you're like, no,\nI want it to be the way it was.\n\n363\n00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.630\nThe way I set it set it up.\n\n364\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.550\nSo I come back here and I say reset that.\n\n365\n00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.990\nThat will bring everything back,\n\n366\n00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.170\nmy character style panel that I\nclosed came back, everything.\n\n367\n00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.690\nSo for me, for instance,\nI have this one called Erica that I use.\n\n368\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.130\nI have a couple extra ones that are here.\n\n369\n00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.040\nBut this is the main one I use.\n\n370\n00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.170\nErica.\n\n371\n00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.760\nNow that looks pretty good.\n\n372\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.000\nI'm not exactly sure that's\nexactly how it should be.\n\n373\n00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.360\nI may have gotten rid of some panels.\n\n374\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.620\nSo, let me go ahead and\nsay Reset Erica and now nothing changed.\n\n375\n00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.240\nIt meant the last time I\nused it I didn't mess it up.\n\n376\n00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.180\nSo I have that there and\n\n377\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.854\nnow I know that that workspace is setup\nhow I need to to get my work done.\n\n378\n00:18:20.854 --> 00:18:26.160\n>> Now Erica is that the to being able\nto reset one of those work spaces,\n\n379\n00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.960\nis that all contingent on after you make\nthe work space, you have to save it first?\n\n380\n00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.100\nI can't just reset something if I\ndon't already have it saved first?\n\n381\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.860\n>> Yes.\nIf you don't already\n\n382\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.650\nhave it saved as a named\nworkspace you can't reset it.\n\n383\n00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.390\nBasically, yeah.\n\n384\n00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.080\nIf you switch to another work space and\n\n385\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.770\nto be able to switch you have\nto have a name assigned to it.\n\n386\n00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.100\nIf you switch to that work space,\n\n387\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.950\nthen it automatically goes back\nto to the last state it was in.\n\n388\n00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.730\nThe reset is, put it back to\nthe way it was when I saved it.\n\n389\n00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.100\nSo we can always kind of start with,\nI guess ground zero for\n\n390\n00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.230\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n391\n00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.360\nBack to base, right?\n\n392\n00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.200\nSo that's kind of workspaces.\n\n393\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.600\nSo again, there's some that are included\nand then you can also create your own.\n\n394\n00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.920\nAnd again, think of why you might need it,\nand don't worry about it.\n\n395\n00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.800\nAnd sometimes I'll have 20 of them and\nI realize I never use that one.\n\n396\n00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.580\nWe can always just come back in here.\n\n397\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.320\nChoose one of the workspaces\nlike My Typography.\n\n398\n00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.740\nWe can get rid of this\none that we just did.\n\n399\n00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.740\nYou have to switch to it first and\nI come in here and say delete Workspace.\n\n400\n00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.810\nNow, they do actually\nlive on your hard drive.\n\n401\n00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:21.710\nI don't remember where.\n\n402\n00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.400\nIt is sometimes trying to\nfind where things are and\n\n403\n00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.200\nthen sometimes they're\nin your preferences.\n\n404\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.390\nIt's gonna be different on a PC as well.\n\n405\n00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:32.590\nThe Adobe Help is really good for that,\nfor giving you the entire path location.\n\n406\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.610\nAnd I often have to reference that,\njust As an FYI.\n\n407\n00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.460\nDon't feel bad.\n\n408\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.020\nI still have to reference that,\nespecially because they do move things and\n\n409\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.180\nas the operating systems change as well,\nthat whole structure changes.\n\n410\n00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.800\nSo sometimes trying to find where my\nworkspaces are versus the workspaces that\n\n411\n00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.900\nAdobe included,\nthey're in different places.\n\n412\n00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.630\nAnd the other thing,\n\n413\n00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.610\nat least on a MAC, not sure on PC,\nis that they're hidden files.\n\n414\n00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.210\nSo even if I search for My Typography and\n\n415\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:01.160\nit's in XML file, if you're interested in\nthe technical end of it, it's a .XML file.\n\n416\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.250\nI can't do a search on that because\nit won't find my hidden files for me.\n\n417\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:09.500\nSo go to the Adobe Help, if you want\nto do that, Adobe Help right here.\n\n418\n00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.150\nInDesign online it goes to that.\n\n419\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.280\nBookmark that page.\n\n420\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.870\nBecause frankly, trying to get here and\nit sends you to somewhere else,\n\n421\n00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.430\nonce you find the Help page, bookmark it.\n\n422\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.880\nThat's what I do in my browser.\n\n423\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.120\nIt's the very first bookmark that's there.\n\n424\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.570\nIt still says inDesignscs4 I think,\nbecause that's the header that was there,\n\n425\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.450\nbut it always brings you\nto the newest version.\n\n426\n00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.050\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n427\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.680\nAlright, so we've got our layout.\n\n428\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.290\nWe've kinda looked how everything\nis on our in InDesign and\n\n429\n00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:38.350\nnow we also want to customize our\nmenus and our shortcuts a little bit.\n\n430\n00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.580\nSo the great thing is\npretty much everything,\n\n431\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.300\nI'm gonna say everything now I think\ncan be customized in InDesign.\n\n432\n00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.940\nSo anything that you do, if you can't\nremember where something is on a menu,\n\n433\n00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.400\ngive it a keyboard shortcut.\n\n434\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.130\nIf it's something you use all\nthe time give it a keyboard shortcut.\n\n435\n00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.550\nFor me again, I use tables a lot and\nI have a whole separate set of shortcuts\n\n436\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.610\nthat is just for\nwhen I'm working with tables.\n\n437\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.780\nAnd because you are kind of limited at\nsome point to your keyboard shortcuts,\n\n438\n00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.430\nunless you want to start doing five\nkeys of keyboard shortcut which\n\n439\n00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.230\nI think is a little hard.\n\n440\n00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.000\nIt's like when I tried to learn to\nplay the organ when I was seven or\n\n441\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.870\neight trying to learn all of those chords,\ntoo many.\n\n442\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:09.750\nI can't remember all of those.\n\n443\n00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.560\nIt would be quicker to go to the menu.\n\n444\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.780\nBut for a lot of things,\nwe need keyboard shortcuts.\n\n445\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.570\nSo we've done a couple of them like\ncommand N, control N for new, print, save,\n\n446\n00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.920\nthose are all pretty much basic.\n\n447\n00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.080\nNow I can change those.\n\n448\n00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.350\nIf I don't want command or\nCtrl P to be print, I can change that.\n\n449\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.380\nThat doesn't make a lot of sense because\nthat's sort of a system-wide thing.\n\n450\n00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.100\nBut I can change every other little thing.\n\n451\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.260\nSo I'm gonna change two of them that\nI know don't have keyboard shortcuts.\n\n452\n00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.940\nAnd that's the thing,\na lot of them don't and\n\n453\n00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.260\nif you use them all the time you\ndefinitely wanna put a keyboard shortcut.\n\n454\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.870\nSometimes because they're in a sub menu,\nor a sub sub-menu, what I keep drilling\n\n455\n00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.990\ndown everytime, because if you are like\nme you do roll down and you get almost to\n\n456\n00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.990\nthe last one in your hands slides up the\nmenu and you have to start all over again.\n\n457\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:49.360\nSo that's frustrating.\n\n458\n00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.285\nAlso there's one that I use that separate,\nI've to go the way to the type menu and\n\n459\n00:21:52.285 --> 00:21:55.495\nall the way down and\nit's called fill up placeholder text.\n\n460\n00:21:55.495 --> 00:21:57.835\nIt's grayed out right now because I\ndon't have a text frame or anywhere for\n\n461\n00:21:57.835 --> 00:22:00.425\na text to go, but we're gonna look\nat that in the future episode.\n\n462\n00:22:00.425 --> 00:22:01.957\nWe're gonna work with text.\n\n463\n00:22:01.957 --> 00:22:03.055\nWe're gonna placeholder text,\n\n464\n00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.570\nwhere I just want to put a bunch of texts\nin there to start working with It's not\n\n465\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.860\nthe actual text,\nit's just text that I have ready to go.\n\n466\n00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.400\nSo, for me I use that a lot.\n\n467\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.120\nThere's no keyboard shortcut for that.\n\n468\n00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.630\nSo, here I am busy typing away.\n\n469\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.110\nI make text frame ready to put\nsome place all their text.\n\n470\n00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.610\nGot to go up.\n\n471\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.790\nAnd when I'm working on my big monitor\nat my office, that's a lot of scroll.\n\n472\n00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.530\nAnd as I scroll all the way to the top and\n\n473\n00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.400\nwe've scroll all the way\ndown to the bottom.\n\n474\n00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.270\nWe know that sounds like first world\nproblems but the fact of the matter is,\n\n475\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.590\nyou do this all day long and you will get\nrepetitive stress injuries from that.\n\n476\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.060\nI've had tennis elbow more\nthan I care to admit.\n\n477\n00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.070\nSo I'm gonna give a keyboard shortcut for\nthat.\n\n478\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.630\nSo I'm gonna go up under the Edit menu,\nand\n\n479\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.110\nagain all the way down at the bottom\nis the Keyboard Shortcut option.\n\n480\n00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.130\nAnd by default, you have Default, and\nyou have shortcuts for Pagemaker seven,\n\n481\n00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.830\nwhich is ancient and\nisn't being made anymore, and\n\n482\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.900\nCork Express four, which they're on 10 or\n11 now and it's still four.\n\n483\n00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.680\nAnd that's because people were\nmigrating from those programs.\n\n484\n00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.810\nPretty much, that's not a think anymore.\n\n485\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.180\nBut if that is you and\nyou have learned something else, and\n\n486\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.115\nyou like the keyboard shortcuts that\nare there, you can choose the keyboard\n\n487\n00:23:05.115 --> 00:23:09.240\nshortcuts from those programs and\nthen in design will adapt those.\n\n488\n00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.210\nKeeping in mind there is a lot of things\none program can do the other one cant do.\n\n489\n00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.060\nSo let's stay with default and\nwe are gonna make a couple of changes and\n\n490\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.760\nit's gonna ask you to save a new set.\n\n491\n00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.910\nSo, we are needed to find out\nwhere is this keyboard shortcut or\n\n492\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.730\nthis action live.\n\n493\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.860\nAnd we can either choose from menus or\nwe have just individual things,\n\n494\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.840\nlike Object Editing.\n\n495\n00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.660\nSo if we're working with objects, it's\nsomething we need to do with an object,\n\n496\n00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.100\nit's gonna be in there.\n\n497\n00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.470\nThe thing we're looking for\nis under the Type menu.\n\n498\n00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.030\nSo I'm gonna come down to Type Menu.\n\n499\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.830\nAnd then the rest of this is here\nalphabetically, so we can find it easily.\n\n500\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.888\nAnd that was called\nFill With Placeholder Text.\n\n501\n00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:45.020\nSo I'm gonna scroll down, and we're\ngonna do Fill With Placeholder Text, and\n\n502\n00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.062\nI'm gonna click on that.\n\n503\n00:23:46.062 --> 00:23:48.669\nAnd I'm gonna come down and\nI'm gonna look at the, Current shortcuts,\n\n504\n00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:50.435\nI wanna make sure that\nthere's nothing in here.\n\n505\n00:23:50.435 --> 00:23:54.730\nIf there is something in here, it's gonna\nbe a shortcut, that maybe I don't like.\n\n506\n00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.090\nI've changed certain ones that\nI can't get my fingers towards,\n\n507\n00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:01.240\nespecially when I'm on a laptop, it just\ndoesn't work for me, so I can change that.\n\n508\n00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.210\nSo, I'm gonna make sure there's nothing\nthere, I'm gonna put in the new shortcut,\n\n509\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.730\nI'm gonna put my cursor in\nthe new shortcut box, and\n\n510\n00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.310\nI'm gonna key in the shortcut,\nand for me I use F2.\n\n511\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.140\nThat's just me.\n\n512\n00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.110\nDon't type in F and then 2,\nwe want to actually key in the actual key.\n\n513\n00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.060\nSo in this case for me, it's F2.\n\n514\n00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.910\nSo I hit the F2 key, and then I'm gonna\ncome here and it says unassigned.\n\n515\n00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.820\nThat's what we wanna see.\n\n516\n00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.990\nWe wanna make sure it's not assigned.\n\n517\n00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.470\nDo something else,\ncuz what InDesign will do\n\n518\n00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.590\nis it will stript it away from that\nother thing and assign it to this one.\n\n519\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.510\nNow if you look at it and\n\n520\n00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.180\nit says it assigned to something and\nyou're like I have no idea what that is.\n\n521\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.300\nYou're probably not gonna use a keyboard\nshort cut so feel free to steal it, but\n\n522\n00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.200\nin this case I wanna make sure\nit's not assigned anything.\n\n523\n00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.560\nIf I did command or control p let's put\nthat in there and it says well that's\n\n524\n00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.090\nassigned Print, I probably don't want to\ntake that away, that would confuse me.\n\n525\n00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.040\nSo I'm gonna hit my F2 again, and I'm\njust gonna come over here and hit Assign.\n\n526\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.020\nNow when I do that, it's gonna tell me,\nit gave me a little warning.\n\n527\n00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.890\nIt says I can't modify the Default set.\n\n528\n00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.630\nI have to create a new one,\nso let's do that.\n\n529\n00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.410\nSo I'll call it Erica 2, because I\nalready have one called Erica, so now,\n\n530\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.410\nthat is the set I'm working on\nright here - you are Erica too.\n\n531\n00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.847\nSo now I can see [INAUDIBLE]\nplace holder text has F2.\n\n532\n00:25:06.847 --> 00:25:10.080\nThere's a couple of things I can go ahead\nand show the set, I can see it all in\n\n533\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.670\ntext, I can impress my friends with\nmy long list of key board short cuts.\n\n534\n00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:16.610\nI rarely ever use,\nthat it just opens up a text file.\n\n535\n00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.320\nWhere I do use that is when I\ncan't find where something is.\n\n536\n00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.200\nIt's not in a menu.\n\n537\n00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.570\nIt's just a thing I do and\nI need a keyboard shortcut for\n\n538\n00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:24.690\nit, could you show set.\n\n539\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.020\nIt opens up in a text editor.\n\n540\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.940\nYou can do a A find command and\nfind what it is you're looking for.\n\n541\n00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.280\nAt least then it shows you the path,\n\n542\n00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.520\nwhere that is, basically I'm going to go\nahead and hit Save and then say okay.\n\n543\n00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.430\nSo now when I go over to the type menu and\ncome down here to fill it with placeholder\n\n544\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.600\ntext you can see that, now there's\na keyboard shortcut assigned to that.\n\n545\n00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.780\nThat's my keyboard shortcut for that.\n\n546\n00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.790\nI'm gonna do it one more time,\n\n547\n00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:49.210\nI'm gonna add another one,\nalso under the type menu called Find Font.\n\n548\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.570\nAnd this shows all fonts that\nare being used in this document, and\n\n549\n00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.090\nthat's really handy because sometimes you\nneed to know what fonts were we using.\n\n550\n00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:00.460\nGo back to the edit menu,\ndown to keyboard shortcuts, same thing,\n\n551\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.930\nwe're gonna go to the type menu and\nI'm gonna go ahead and do find font.\n\n552\n00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:09.660\nAnd I'll come in here and I'll say F3 and\nagain if you put something in there, and\n\n553\n00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.380\nyou don't like it and you want to\nchange it, don't hit the delete key.\n\n554\n00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.330\nCuz see, we hit the Delete key.\n\n555\n00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.430\nIt says.\nYou'd like to assign\n\n556\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:15.350\nthe Delete key to that.\n\n557\n00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.960\nNo, I don't wanna assign the Delete key.\n\n558\n00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.780\nJust keep keying in.\n\n559\n00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.360\nSee if you can just keep hitting\nthings and find one that isn't.\n\n560\n00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.978\nLook it.\nThat's a sign.\n\n561\n00:26:21.978 --> 00:26:23.520\nThat was my.\n\n562\n00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.089\nMy little spotlight came\non cuz that's my F1 key.\n\n563\n00:26:26.089 --> 00:26:28.220\nSo F2 is fill placeholder text.\n\n564\n00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.560\nF3 unassigned.\n\n565\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.270\nThat's what I want.\n\n566\n00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.700\nLet's assign.\nSign that and we'll say okay.\n\n567\n00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.190\nSo now I have that keyboard\nshortcut set up here.\n\n568\n00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:38.270\nI'm gonna switch back to this one\nactually because it has all my\n\n569\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.790\nkeyboard shortcuts there.\n\n570\n00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.880\nSo all the customizations that\nI've done I will now turn that on.\n\n571\n00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.950\nThat's been off until this point,\nI have that turned on so\n\n572\n00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.050\nnow all my keyboard shortcuts are there.\n\n573\n00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.650\nSo again, you can have ones for different\nthings that you do If you, like I said,\n\n574\n00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.070\nwork in something like tables, where you\nread a lot of keyboard shortcuts, and\n\n575\n00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.550\nyou know that they're duplicate\nshortcuts of something else,\n\n576\n00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:01.780\nyou can kind of compartmentalize that\ninto its own keyboard shortcut set.\n\n577\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.000\nYou can save those\nkeyboard shortcuts also.\n\n578\n00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.520\nThat's a file as well.\n\n579\n00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.710\nYou can find where that is.\n\n580\n00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.150\nAnd we can, again you'd have to\ngo to the Help menu to find where\n\n581\n00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.220\nthe path is for that.\n\n582\n00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.170\nFind it,\nyou can give that to someone else.\n\n583\n00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.100\nNow for me keyboard shortcuts\nare personal, they make sense to me and\n\n584\n00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.410\nmaybe not to anybody else.\n\n585\n00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.730\nBut most of the settings that\nwe make we can actually save and\n\n586\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.910\nshare with other people.\n\n587\n00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.430\nSo we know that they're using the exact\nsame setup, so just a little tip there.\n\n588\n00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.200\nI'm gonna do one more thing\nwith preferences, and\n\n589\n00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.380\nI'm gonna show you the different\ncolored backgrounds that's there,\n\n590\n00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.530\nthey introduced this quite a while ago.\n\n591\n00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.150\nFor me I have it looking like the old one,\nso the background is kind of gray,\n\n592\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.710\nit's called the Light theme.\n\n593\n00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.930\nI know that Adobe's really into the dark\ntheme with the light lettering on\n\n594\n00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:43.830\nthe background.\n\n595\n00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.380\nFor me, that causes eye issues,\nso I can't deal with that.\n\n596\n00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.030\nBut I can change that in my Preferences,\n\n597\n00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.290\nI hope that preference never goes away,\nback to our Preferences.\n\n598\n00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.750\nCommand or control K will bring up your\npreferences on a Mac it's under in design,\n\n599\n00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.732\non a pc it's under the edit menu then\nPreferences, and we'll actually go into\n\n600\n00:27:59.732 --> 00:28:03.610\ninterface, at the interface,\nthe appearance at the top, color theme.\n\n601\n00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.170\nSo we have these different color themes,\nlight, medium light,\n\n602\n00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.440\ndark, custom whatever.\n\n603\n00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.470\nWe can play with that and\nplay with the percentage.\n\n604\n00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:14.080\nSo if I turn it to dark just so we can\nsee it, we can see what that looks like.\n\n605\n00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.030\nThat's what a lot of people like to use,\nthat's what a lot of people are really\n\n606\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.250\nfamiliar with nowadays,\nit ships with that.\n\n607\n00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.200\nThat is what it looks like,\nwhen you open it.\n\n608\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.890\nI'm gonna turn it back to light, for\nmy own use, and then I can match the paste\n\n609\n00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.460\nboard to the themed colors, well,\nso it changes in darkness as well.\n\n610\n00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.740\nOtherwise, you can leave that off,\n\n611\n00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.930\nand it will stay to light grey,\neven when you change the theme color.\n\n612\n00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.840\nAll right, so we can change that.\n\n613\n00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.500\nNow, I know we don't have anything on\nthe page but we're gonna go ahead and\n\n614\n00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.720\nsave this document.\n\n615\n00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.440\nSo we're gonna save it as a document.\n\n616\n00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.720\nWe're also gonna save it as a template.\n\n617\n00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.380\nSo in a previous episode I showed you\n\n618\n00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.470\nthat there was the INDD file\nwhich is an InDesign file.\n\n619\n00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.230\nWe're gonna look at\na different kind as well and\n\n620\n00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.010\nwe're also gonna go into a,\nmore in a future episode, but\n\n621\n00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.870\nI just wanted to show you what\nit looks like when we save it.\n\n622\n00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.870\nSo, I haven't done anything yet,\nI haven't done any saves, so\n\n623\n00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:01.110\nI'm gonna do Cmd or Ctrl+S to save, or\nI can come over here to the File menu,\n\n624\n00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.620\nand choose Save, or Save As.\n\n625\n00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.140\nNow, because I haven't even saved yet,\n\n626\n00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.050\nwhen I do that S, it's actually doing\na Save As, can see at the top here.\n\n627\n00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.140\nCuz it automatically says, hey, you didn't\nsave this yet, let's save it as something.\n\n628\n00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.930\nNow it does keep track of what\nyou're doing when you're working.\n\n629\n00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.150\nSo if it crashes,\nyou're probably okay, but\n\n630\n00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.200\nget that first save in\nthere just to be sure.\n\n631\n00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.990\nIt can recover, if not, but\nnot all the time, so to be safe.\n\n632\n00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:28.550\nI'm just one of those people, Cmd+Ctrl S,\nall day long, save, save, save, save.\n\n633\n00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.416\nThe programs that now\nauto save freak me out.\n\n634\n00:29:30.416 --> 00:29:32.150\nI I have to be on the save all day long.\n\n635\n00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:36.590\nI'm just gonna save this up to my desktop,\nand I can see that it's .indd, and\n\n636\n00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:41.070\nthat's because by default, down here at\nthe format it says it's InDesign document.\n\n637\n00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:43.340\nI also can choose a template or IDML.\n\n638\n00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:48.330\nWe'll worry about those latter, but\nInDesign template will give me .indt and\n\n639\n00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.390\nIDML will give me a .idml.\n\n640\n00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.970\nSo just know that by default it\nthinks you want to save it as\n\n641\n00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:53.860\na document, which we do.\n\n642\n00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.960\nSo we're gonna save that,\nsave that out to the desktop.\n\n643\n00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.300\nI'm gonna go out to the desktop and\nlook at that, and\n\n644\n00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:04.560\nthere's our file on title 14.INDD, and I\nhave this lock file that's there as well.\n\n645\n00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.330\nIt kind of looks like on title\n14 with some junk after it.\n\n646\n00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.110\nThat is the thing that's keeping track\nof everything that you're doing.\n\n647\n00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.380\nSo if it crashes it will pull from there.\n\n648\n00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.300\nThis file is automatically generated and\n\n649\n00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.120\nthrown in the same folder\nas you other document.\n\n650\n00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.520\nWhen you close that document it goes away.\n\n651\n00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.030\nDon't ever trash that while it's open\nbecause it's keeping track of everything.\n\n652\n00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.180\nYou don't have to worry about it though,\nit just sits there.\n\n653\n00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.340\nSo if I close that document lt's come\nin here and close that document,\n\n654\n00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.870\ngo back out, that lock file is gone.\n\n655\n00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:35.670\nIf I save it as an InDesign\ntemplate it would say .indt,\n\n656\n00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.000\nand as an IDML file would say .idml.\n\n657\n00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.290\nAnd they look a little different,\nthe icons look a little different.\n\n658\n00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.850\nAnd each version looks a little\ndifferent so we won't go into all those.\n\n659\n00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.120\nBut just always look at\nthe extension that's there so\n\n660\n00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.430\nyou know what kind of file it is.\n\n661\n00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:48.850\nSo that's wrapping it all up.\n\n662\n00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:49.660\nWe got it.\n\n663\n00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.970\nIt wasn't very exciting what we saved,\nbut it's there, we've got a file saved.\n\n664\n00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.490\nWe can move on from there.\n\n665\n00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:58.160\n>> You know what I think is amazing is\nhow much you showed us how much you can\n\n666\n00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.300\n>> Can customize it to suit\n\n667\n00:30:59.300 --> 00:30:59.960\nyour own needs.\n\n668\n00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.080\nAnd like you said, the way you customize\nit might not be the way I customize it.\n\n669\n00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.790\nAnd I like the other too, Ctrl+S is\nyour friend, or Cmd+S is your friend.\n\n670\n00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:10.050\nNow it does like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n671\n00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.610\nBut before we sign off,\n\n672\n00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.940\ndo you got any additional words\nyou'd like to throw into this one?\n\n673\n00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.150\n>> Just remember that everything\nI showed was my preferences.\n\n674\n00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:20.840\nAnd customize it, it makes you work\nquicker and like I said, more efficiently.\n\n675\n00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.850\nThat's the goal, at least for me, is to\nwork efficiently and know that everything\n\n676\n00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.660\nis kind of where I expect it to be,\nso I can just get my work done.\n\n677\n00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.210\n>> Very good.\n\n678\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.240\nWell, we appreciate you joining us in\nthe studios, and we appreciate you,\n\n679\n00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.400\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n680\n00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.029\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n681\n00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:35.513\nI

00:00:17.677\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:21.736\nwe're continuing through our series\nin the Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:24.864\nJoining me back in the studios again\nis none other than Erica Gaman.\n\n6\n00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:25.722\nErica how're you doing today?\n\n7\n00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:26.798\n>> Pretty good Wes, thanks.\n\n8\n00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:27.900\n>> All right, very good.\n\n9\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.152\nSo we've had an introduction now.\n\n10\n00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:31.523\nWhere are we going next?.\n\n11\n00:00:31.523 --> 00:00:34.166\n>> We're gonna start actually\nputting stuff on our page.\n\n12\n00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.005\nWe're gonna do some elements and\nsome guides.\n\n13\n00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:37.143\nWe're gonna start out super, super simple.\n\n14\n00:00:37.143 --> 00:00:39.971\nWe're just gonna put put a few elements\non there, but yeah let's actually start\n\n15\n00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:42.647\nputting stuff on there so we have\nsomething to look at, something to print.\n\n16\n00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:46.367\nSo up to this point we've been looking\nat how to navigate around the Adobe\n\n17\n00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:49.540\nworkspace, and how to just find\nour way and get our bearings,\n\n18\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.809\nnow let's start putting stuff on the page.\n\n19\n00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.165\nSo now the real fun begins.\n\n20\n00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:56.584\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\njump into InDesign, and\n\n21\n00:00:56.584 --> 00:01:01.821\nactually I am going to open up a file, and\nI can do File > Open, open from there.\n\n22\n00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:04.250\nI also have Open Recent,\nthis is kinda cool.\n\n23\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.160\nSometimes it throws the whole entire\npathway on there for you, maybe not so\n\n24\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.650\nconvenient, but the one I'm looking for\n\n25\n00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.720\nis one that I know that I just opened\nrecently so it's there, Elements,\n\n26\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.570\nso this is just a file that I have,\nI'm gonna actually jump to the first page.\n\n27\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.730\nAnd, we're just gonna look at some of\nthe things that you can put on the page.\n\n28\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.830\nAnd we're gonna get more\nin depth onto each of them.\n\n29\n00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.340\nWhen we go into text,\nwe'll talk more about text frames.\n\n30\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.180\nRight now we're just gonna create some\nframes, and then we'll worry about how to\n\n31\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.990\nmanipulate them, how to make them\nlook pretty, things like that.\n\n32\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.870\nSo right now we're just gonna\ntalk about the frames themselves.\n\n33\n00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.190\nEverything in InDesign lives in a frame.\n\n34\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.270\nNow, as we'll see, when we start\nputting images in, in a later episode,\n\n35\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.430\nwe start putting in text,\nthings like that.\n\n36\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.370\nIt's smart enough to create that frame for\nyou, or\n\n37\n00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.180\nyou can start from scratch and create\na frame, and then put stuff into it.\n\n38\n00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.540\nSo, Adobe always gives you 1, 2, 5,\n18 different ways to do the same thing.\n\n39\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.210\nSometimes that's good, sometimes that's\na little cumbersome, in this case,\n\n40\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.090\nit's really good.\n\n41\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.730\nSo I can create frames,\nstart putting frames on my page,\n\n42\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.250\nbecause I don't know what the text is or\n\n43\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.580\nwhat the images are gonna be, but I can\nstart laying it out without anything.\n\n44\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.480\nOr if I've got everything ready to go,\nI can start putting stuff on the page and\n\n45\n00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.410\nit will create the frames for me.\n\n46\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.960\nSo first off,\nwe're gonna start with text frames.\n\n47\n00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.260\nAnd first I just wanna show you\nwhat a text frame looks like, and\n\n48\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.020\nthen we'll build one.\n\n49\n00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.780\nSo, obviously,\na text frame has text in it.\n\n50\n00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.110\nYou should see outlines.\n\n51\n00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.520\nIn this case, they're these\nlight blue outline, hopefully,\n\n52\n00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.570\nyou can see that, of the frame.\n\n53\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.350\nAnd, in this case,\nI've got a three column frame.\n\n54\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.300\nWe're not going to worry about that right\nnow, again, we're just talking about text\n\n55\n00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.690\nFrames, and I know it's text frame\nright now because there's text in it.\n\n56\n00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.400\nBut if there wasn't any text in it,\nhow would I know it's a text frame?\n\n57\n00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.670\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust go to a blank page.\n\n58\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.270\nI did a little keyboard shortcut for that,\n\n59\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.500\nwe'll talk about that in the pages in\nthe episode when we cover pages, but I do\n\n60\n00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.940\na little keyboard shortcut you're gonna\nsee me do a lot, so I'm gonna show you,\n\n61\n00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.040\ngive you a little preview of that right\nnow, Cmd or Ctrl+Shift+P adds a new page.\n\n62\n00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.100\nSo, I just did that really quickly,\nI threw it in.\n\n63\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.390\nDon't worry where it lands because right\nnow we're just working with single pages.\n\n64\n00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.410\nBut I just wanna create\na page that's blank.\n\n65\n00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.820\nAnd I wanna create a text frame and\n\n66\n00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.970\nI wanna show you what\na text frame looks like.\n\n67\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.480\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead\nto my tools panel and\n\n68\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.530\nI'm gonna come over here and\nreset my workspace.\n\n69\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.760\nWe already talked about workspaces,\nbut I wanna reset that and\n\n70\n00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.480\nget back to the one I'm used to.\n\n71\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.590\nAnd I'm gonna come over here to the tools\npanel, and I'm gonna choose the type tool.\n\n72\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.260\nSometimes I call it the text tool, only\nbecause that's one of these things that\n\n73\n00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.580\nAdobe probably calls it a type tool,\nbut a text frame.\n\n74\n00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.390\nSo they're interchangeable.\n\n75\n00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.150\nSo it is the type tool officially.\n\n76\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.450\nI'm gonna come over here and choose it and\nwhen I do it my control panel changed so\n\n77\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.180\nnow I have all these text options.\n\n78\n00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.150\nBut what I wanna do is\ncreate a text frame, so\n\n79\n00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.900\nall I'm gonna do is create and we're\nnot gonna put anything in it right now.\n\n80\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.540\nI'm just gonna click and drag,\nthat's how we create frames.\n\n81\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.750\nso click and drag to the size that I want.\n\n82\n00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.030\nI can resize this, I'm not worried about,\nI'm just gonna click and\n\n83\n00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.620\ndrag and let you guys, Go.\n\n84\n00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.020\nAnd I get my flashing cursor,\nso it says I'm ready for text.\n\n85\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.480\nLike I said in a future episode we'll talk\nabout getting text in there, where comes\n\n86\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.420\nfrom, how it gets in there, but\nright now I can say that's a text frame.\n\n87\n00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.590\nNow if I didn't have\nthe type tool selected, so\n\n88\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.780\nI have this flashing cursor,\nlet's say I created this yesterday and\n\n89\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.240\nI forgot what I did and I come and\nlook at it, I open up I go to recent,\n\n90\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.090\nopen recent and I look at that,\nand this is what I see.\n\n91\n00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.010\nJust this big frame In\na blue with a blue outline.\n\n92\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.810\nWhat is that?\n\n93\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.880\nI don't know.\nI don't know what I did.\n\n94\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.790\nAnd I see this all the time again from\ndesigners that have been working for\n\n95\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.850\never and ever, and\n\n96\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.030\nthey've wanted just a box with some\ncolor in it and they created text frame.\n\n97\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.330\nThat's dangerous, because you can\naccidentally put text into that and\n\n98\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.170\nmaybe that's not what you\nwanted into that box.\n\n99\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.560\nSo always know what kind\nof frame you're looking at.\n\n100\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.570\nNow just looking at it I don't know.\n\n101\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.750\nAnd if you don't see the edges and\nmaybe you have that turned off.Under\n\n102\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.510\nthe view menu, you have this extras and\nthere is a lot of stuff in the extras, but\n\n103\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.560\nthere is Hide and Show Frem Edges, so you\nmight not see it so if it's not selected,\n\n104\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.274\nI can't even see that it's there.\n\n105\n00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:52.480\nNow if I roll over it or\nI select it, It does show up.\n\n106\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.620\nI don't know why anyone would wanna\nwork like that, but maybe you do.\n\n107\n00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.020\nAgain, it's a preference.\n\n108\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.490\nI'm gonna say show frame just so\n\n109\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.350\nI can always see where my elements are,\neven if those elements are empty.\n\n110\n00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.600\nSo there's nothing in this text frame.\n\n111\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.030\nIf I select this frame, and\nmost of the time you can click anywhere,\n\n112\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.690\nIf you get that little square,\nlet's zoom in.\n\n113\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.230\nI'm gonna zoom in really quick.\n\n114\n00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.200\nSo you can see what my cursor changes to.\n\n115\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.310\nIt's that little square and\n\n116\n00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.340\nit just says hey there's something\nthere that I'm rolling over.\n\n117\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.950\nI haven't actually selected it,\nI just rolled over it.\n\n118\n00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.720\nIf you see that you can click anywhere.\n\n119\n00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.280\nSometimes if you click in the middle\nnothing happens, because it's a completely\n\n120\n00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.430\nblank frame, and you basically just\nclicked the paste board back behind.\n\n121\n00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.170\nSo just keep that in mind sometimes\nyou have to actually hit the edge.\n\n122\n00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.270\nThat's why having those frame\nedges turned on is so handy,\n\n123\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.150\ncuz then you can actually\nfind where that edge is.\n\n124\n00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.520\nBut when I click on it I see that I get\ntons of little squares all the way around.\n\n125\n00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.440\nSo on the very four corners and then\nalso the midpoints of each of those, so\n\n126\n00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.640\nwe've got eight grab handles.\n\n127\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.100\nWe've actually got nine,\nthere's one in the middle, but\n\n128\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.070\nit doesn't show up anymore.\n\n129\n00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.370\nIt used to show up, actually,\nwhen you roll over it, but\n\n130\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.600\nit doesn't always show up now,\nbut I've got nine grab handles.\n\n131\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.280\nThat means I can grab them and\nresize them.\n\n132\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.510\nWe'll talk about that later as well,\n\n133\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.990\nbut what makes the text frame different\nis that I have these over here.\n\n134\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.990\nI have these.\n\n135\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.940\nOne in the upper left, and I've got\nthe same kind in the lower right, and\n\n136\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.230\nwhat those are are text inflow and\noutflow boxes,\n\n137\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.750\nbecause when text comes into a frame,\nlet me back up.\n\n138\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.110\nWhen you put frames together,\nyou can thread them together.\n\n139\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.880\nMeaning, I can have a text frame on one\npage that continues on page two, three,\n\n140\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.680\nfour, and it continues on,\nthey're different frames,\n\n141\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.450\nbecause you can't have a frame\nthat goes across multiple spreads.\n\n142\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.680\nBut you can have the same text\nthat is threaded through.\n\n143\n00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.320\nSo the text comes in the upper\nleft an goes out the lower right.\n\n144\n00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.650\nI mean that's basically\nthink of it like a book.\n\n145\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.550\nThat's how we've always read text.\n\n146\n00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.560\nAgain, so when you're reading English.\n\n147\n00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.370\nOther languages go\nthe opposite direction but\n\n148\n00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.040\nin this case we're gonna stick with this.\n\n149\n00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.010\nSo the text comes in the upper left,\nin this little info box, and\n\n150\n00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.900\nit goes out here.\n\n151\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.110\nNow if you are not threading text frames,\ndon't worry about it,\n\n152\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.860\nbut I know that when I click on\nthis I will see these options.\n\n153\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.640\nI also see a blue square and\na yellow square.\n\n154\n00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.580\nNow we are gonna leave those for\na later day as well.\n\n155\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.800\nThose are kind of specialty things.\n\n156\n00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.810\nYou know as I roll over it, it does\ntell me what it is, I've go tool tips.\n\n157\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.470\nTurned on by default, and I can see what\nthis is, but I want to look at it and go,\n\n158\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.330\nthat's a text frame.\n\n159\n00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.650\nSo, I know it's not a graphic's frame or\nanything else.\n\n160\n00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.290\nIt's a text frame,\n\n161\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.070\nI'm going to leave it here at some point,\nI'm going to put text into that.\n\n162\n00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.540\nRight now we're just selecting it.\n\n163\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.290\nI also can fill it with placeholder text,\nso\n\n164\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.680\nthat's one thing I'm going to do right\nnow is fill it with placeholder text.\n\n165\n00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.720\nSo, when I want to put text in a text\nframe I can just double click on a text\n\n166\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.320\nframe and it automatically\nswitches to the type tool.\n\n167\n00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.100\nI'll do that again,\nI have the selection tool selected.\n\n168\n00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.520\nI double clicked on the text frame and\n\n169\n00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.080\nit switched to the type tool because it\nknows hey you must want to type in there.\n\n170\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.147\nAnd I want to fill that\nwith some placeholder text.\n\n171\n00:07:44.147 --> 00:07:47.575\nIn the previous movie we set up\na keyboard shortcut for that, f2 but\n\n172\n00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:50.841\nI'm actually gonna used the menu item so\nyou can see where it is.\n\n173\n00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:54.537\nUnder the type menu, down at the bottom,\nFill with Placeholder Text and\n\n174\n00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:57.890\nit's gonna go ahead and\njust throw some text in there.\n\n175\n00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.921\nSo now your text isn't going to look like\nthis, your text is going to be called,\n\n176\n00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:03.977\nwhat I'd like to call fakey fake Latin.\n\n177\n00:08:03.977 --> 00:08:08.691\nIt's not even lorem ipsum, it's fakey\nfake Latin, it's actually real Latin but\n\n178\n00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:11.852\nthe point of place holder text,\none of the points, is so\n\n179\n00:08:11.852 --> 00:08:16.026\nyou can see how your text is gonna flow\nwhen we start making adjustments and\n\n180\n00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:18.040\nactually stylizing the text.\n\n181\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.750\nSo we get an idea of how things\nhyphenated, things like that.\n\n182\n00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.431\nWell if it's in a fakey-fake language,\nor something it doesn't understand,\n\n183\n00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:26.606\ncuz it's assuming I'm\nworking in US English.\n\n184\n00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:28.427\nIt doesn't know where to break it so\n\n185\n00:08:28.427 --> 00:08:32.507\nI like to put in text that actually make\nsense in this case just have, what is it?\n\n186\n00:08:32.507 --> 00:08:34.928\nThe time machine page by HG Wells.\n\n187\n00:08:34.928 --> 00:08:37.320\nI just changed out everyone well,\n\n188\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.290\nkeep the fresh to do that we\nneed to go out to our desktops.\n\n189\n00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.050\nSo I'm gonna show you where that\nlives if you wanna change it.\n\n190\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.047\nSo I'm gonna hide InDesign, I'm gonna go\nout to On the Mac I go out to my hard\n\n191\n00:08:48.047 --> 00:08:51.416\ndrive, and I actually have this\nover on the sidebar over here.\n\n192\n00:08:51.416 --> 00:08:54.030\nBut if not, it's in applications,\nAdobe and Design.\n\n193\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.660\nAnd in here,\nwe have a file called placeholder.txt.\n\n194\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.280\nNow, you might not see\nthat when you first start.\n\n195\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.040\nIt's a hidden file, it's there, but\n\n196\n00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.250\nyou can just drag a new file in, the file\nneeds to be called placeholder and\n\n197\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.630\nwithout the capital p, so lowercase p,\nit needs to be a plaintext file.\n\n198\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.480\nSo any text that you want to put in there.\n\n199\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.300\nIf you're working for a company, you're\nworking in-house design for them, or\n\n200\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.090\nit's school work, or whatever, and\n\n201\n00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.360\nyou want to have text that makes sense\nto you, go get the text from wherever.\n\n202\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.720\nYou can go out to Google.\n\n203\n00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.110\nAnd get the Google books I think it is.\n\n204\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.370\nA lot of public domain type.\n\n205\n00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.860\nThings like that, and I just grab the type\nand drop that in there, and I put it.\n\n206\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.792\nIn my case I bring it into text edit.\n\n207\n00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:37.578\nI think it's text edit.\n\n208\n00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:38.130\nIs that what I use?\n\n209\n00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.480\nYeah, text edit and bring that in\nthere and save it as plain text.\n\n210\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.140\nSo it does have to be plain text,\nno formatting, and\n\n211\n00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.430\nthen save it as a .txt file,\nplaceholder.txt.\n\n212\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.240\nMake sure it sits in the same folder.\n\n213\n00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.270\nAs InDesign.\n\n214\n00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.321\nNow, and you don't have to do anything\nelse you don't have to restart or\n\n215\n00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:57.874\nanything, now when you're back in InDesign\nand you do fill with placeholder text,\n\n216\n00:09:57.874 --> 00:10:00.496\nit uses that file that's there,\nso that's just a quick way.\n\n217\n00:10:00.496 --> 00:10:02.185\nI'm going to show you\nanother preference as well,\n\n218\n00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.290\nyou noticed when I brought this in,\nthat's pretty big type.\n\n219\n00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.090\nI mean it's not huge if I go to 100%,\nI'm just doing my key commands.\n\n220\n00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.520\nI did command one or\ncontrol one to bring it to a 100%.\n\n221\n00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.820\nI also did command zero which\nputs the entire page in there.\n\n222\n00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.598\nAnd I like that because if I\nchange the size of my workspace,\n\n223\n00:10:19.598 --> 00:10:21.377\nby grabbing this handle, let me see,\n\n224\n00:10:21.377 --> 00:10:25.121\nyou're not going to be able to see it\nprobably, my head's probably in the way.\n\n225\n00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:29.260\nDown here in the lower right, you can kind\nof see, I get this double headed arrow.\n\n226\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.700\nI can move this in and everything\ngets smaller because I have that,\n\n227\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.650\nthe workspace in the frame,\nthe application frame.\n\n228\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.390\nAs I move it in,\nit continually fits that in page.\n\n229\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.940\nSo, I don't have to keep resizing,\nif at anytime you wanna maximize it,\n\n230\n00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.900\nyou can hit the maximize button\nwhich is up here, a little plus.\n\n231\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.460\nWe click and it automatically takes\nup all that screen space again.\n\n232\n00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.499\nSo in this case it's not bad type,\nbut it's probably too big.\n\n233\n00:10:53.499 --> 00:10:56.585\nI can come up here and see that\nit's 18 point, that is kind of big,\n\n234\n00:10:56.585 --> 00:10:58.430\nthat might not be what you want.\n\n235\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.855\nThere is a default font that is set for\nyou when you start InDesign.\n\n236\n00:11:02.855 --> 00:11:05.500\nThey've recently changed,\nI think it's now minion pro.\n\n237\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.180\nIt was Times New Roman I\nbelieve a long time ago.\n\n238\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.340\nI never used either of those.\n\n239\n00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:09.880\nI like this.\n\n240\n00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.830\nI also for\npresentation sake I like bigger text.\n\n241\n00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.010\nSo, 18 point is a little big for\nmost things but\n\n242\n00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.210\nI like it because you\ncan see it on my screen.\n\n243\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.230\nBut I can change that.\n\n244\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.598\nSo, that every time I do that\nfill with placeholder text or\n\n245\n00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:25.887\njust start typing It will automatically\nbe in the font that I want it to be.\n\n246\n00:11:25.887 --> 00:11:28.645\nWe're gonna to go into fonts\nin a future episode, but\n\n247\n00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:32.073\nI just want to show you an idea of\nhow we can set that so that, again,\n\n248\n00:11:32.073 --> 00:11:34.290\nI don't have to change this every time.\n\n249\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.940\nSo, if I were drawing several frames,\nI'm gonna draw this frame and\n\n250\n00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.410\nfill with placeholder text,\nI'm gonna use my keyboard Shortcut F2,\n\n251\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.400\nand then I'm gonna draw another frame,\nagain click and drag.\n\n252\n00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.250\nFill with placeholder text cuz I\"m\njust laying this out right now,\n\n253\n00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.057\nand then I realize I don't like that font.\n\n254\n00:11:49.057 --> 00:11:52.980\nI gotta go change all that font,\nor I can change it ahead of time.\n\n255\n00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.430\nSo here's what we do.\n\n256\n00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.789\nWith preferences, and I didn't mention\nthis in my talk about preferences earlier\n\n257\n00:11:58.789 --> 00:12:01.418\nbut with preferences most\nof them are not sticky.\n\n258\n00:12:01.418 --> 00:12:03.380\nSo a sticky preference\nmeans I set it once.\n\n259\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.013\nNo matter when I set it,\nthat's the default behavior going forward.\n\n260\n00:12:07.013 --> 00:12:09.164\nMost of them are not so\nI assumed all of them are not,\n\n261\n00:12:09.164 --> 00:12:12.070\ncause I can't remember which ones are and\nwhich ones aren't.\n\n262\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.410\nSo I just assume all of them are not,\nand so I want to set a preference.\n\n263\n00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.190\nIf I wanted to be the default\nbehavior from now going forward.\n\n264\n00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.080\nIf you do it with no document open,\nthat becomes the default behavior for\n\n265\n00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.330\nall new documents.\n\n266\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.840\nSo I'm gonna close this document.\n\n267\n00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.530\nI don't need to save it,\nwe didn't do anything special to it.\n\n268\n00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.270\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and\nmake some preference changes.\n\n269\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.560\nOne of them being my font.\n\n270\n00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.450\nSo I'm gonna choose the Type tool.\n\n271\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.860\nAnd now I don't have a Type frame\nsitting there or a Text frame out here.\n\n272\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.350\nI don't even have a document open.\n\n273\n00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.990\nDoesn't matter.\n\n274\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.540\nI'm just setting the default.\n\n275\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.580\nI'm gonna go up here to the Control panel,\n\n276\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.690\nwhich is clicked on by default\nwhen I hit the Type tool.\n\n277\n00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.860\nAnd I'm gonna click\nthe Character Formatting options, and\n\n278\n00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.210\nI'm gonna choose a font.\n\n279\n00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.830\nAgain, we're gonna go into\nall this in a future episode.\n\n280\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.720\nBut I could just choose a font, find one\nyou like and set a point size to that.\n\n281\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.300\nI come over here, click it once, and\nit selects everything in that field, and\n\n282\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.220\nthen let's just make it something,\nwe'll just make it a little bigger, 20.\n\n283\n00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.530\nSo that's all I did was\nchange the font and the size.\n\n284\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.210\nNow, actually let me change it to\nsomething else we can actually see that\n\n285\n00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:09.980\nsomething has changed.\n\n286\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.855\nI'll change it to Palatino.\n\n287\n00:13:12.855 --> 00:13:15.588\nWe'll just make it Palatino Regular,\ngreat, 20 point.\n\n288\n00:13:15.588 --> 00:13:19.440\nNow when I create a new document and\nI click and drag out that text frame and\n\n289\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.798\nI use my keyboard shortcut F2, now it's\ngoing to look really huge because I'm on\n\n290\n00:13:23.798 --> 00:13:27.200\na 6x4 and not the letter,\nI used the postcard setup.\n\n291\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.190\nWhen I click that now I can see that\nthat text is at 20 point Palatino,\n\n292\n00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.280\nthat's my default behavior for that.\n\n293\n00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.725\nThe great thing is, if I decide well I\ndon't want it for this document If I don't\n\n294\n00:13:38.725 --> 00:13:44.608\nhave anything selected, but I select the\ntype tool and change this now to 14 point.\n\n295\n00:13:44.608 --> 00:13:48.212\nAnd now when I create a new text\nframe in this same document, and\n\n296\n00:13:48.212 --> 00:13:53.590\nfill with placeholder text or start\ntyping, it's automatically that 14 point.\n\n297\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.970\nSo no document open.\n\n298\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.430\nDefault behavior for all new documents.\n\n299\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.960\nDocument open but nothing selected,\n\n300\n00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.760\nit's the default behavior for\nall new elements in that document.\n\n301\n00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.600\nIf you have something selected\nlike text and you make a change,\n\n302\n00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.730\nyou're obviously just changing that text.\n\n303\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.470\nHope that makes sense.\n\n304\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:15.490\nKind of a nice way to think about\nhow to organize your preferences,\n\n305\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.670\nin this case, text.\n\n306\n00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.560\nAll right so that's how we get a text\nframe, and we get some text in it.\n\n307\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.750\nAgain, we're gonna leave\nthe formatting and all that for later.\n\n308\n00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.375\nI'm gonna go back to, actually,\none of my recent files.\n\n309\n00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:28.420\nFile>open>recent.\n\n310\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.918\nWanna go back to that elements 1.\n\n311\n00:14:30.918 --> 00:14:31.981\nAnd we're gonna jump,\n\n312\n00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:35.510\nhere's another keyboard shortcut that\nI use all the time command or ctrl+J.\n\n313\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.000\nBrings up the Go To Page.\n\n314\n00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.440\nI call it jump, because that's what it\nwas in that other program, Corp Express,\n\n315\n00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.300\nback in the day.\n\n316\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.634\nJump, so in my mind,\nit's always jump to whatever page,\n\n317\n00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.892\njump to page one where text frames are.\n\n318\n00:14:46.892 --> 00:14:48.220\nSo there's our text frames.\n\n319\n00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.820\nAgain, we just put them on the page,\nwe're ready to go.\n\n320\n00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.660\nLet's create some new elements.\n\n321\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.370\nThink I'll jump to the next page, and\nI have something called Graphics Frames.\n\n322\n00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.310\nNow, these Frames.\n\n323\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.170\nGonna zoom in a little bit.\n\n324\n00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.600\nWe have a little,\nsorry my Adobe reader is yelling at me.\n\n325\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.384\nNow I'm gonna say no.\n\n326\n00:15:05.384 --> 00:15:07.216\nSorry, you probably get that all the time.\n\n327\n00:15:07.216 --> 00:15:09.677\n[LAUGH] I just want that to go away so\nit'll leave us alone.\n\n328\n00:15:09.677 --> 00:15:10.740\nSo I have a graphics frame and\n\n329\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.502\nthe reason I know it's a graphics frame\ncause there's an X in the middle.\n\n330\n00:15:13.502 --> 00:15:14.086\nAll right, so\n\n331\n00:15:14.086 --> 00:15:17.076\nwe're gonna look at graphic frames\nversus just frames in just a second.\n\n332\n00:15:17.076 --> 00:15:20.588\nSo graphics frame basically says,\nI'm gonna put something in there.\n\n333\n00:15:20.588 --> 00:15:24.550\nMaybe a PDF, or an image, an Illustrator\nfile, a Photoshop file, something.\n\n334\n00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.460\nI'm gonna put a graphics file in there.\n\n335\n00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.590\nNow, the great thing is\nI can put that there and\n\n336\n00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.900\nnever put a graphic in there and\nthat's okay.\n\n337\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.390\nI also have something just called frames,\n\n338\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.580\nwhich on the next page we\nhave these unassigned frames.\n\n339\n00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.240\nAnd they don't have the x in there.\n\n340\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.630\nAnd that says that's a shape,\nthat's a frame for just, just for\n\n341\n00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.200\nthe sake of having a shape.\n\n342\n00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.424\nAnd I'm not gonna put a graphic in there.\n\n343\n00:15:45.424 --> 00:15:48.876\nInDesign's smart enough that at any point\nI can go, actually let's put a graphic in\n\n344\n00:15:48.876 --> 00:15:51.223\nthere and it automatically\nchanges it to the other type.\n\n345\n00:15:51.223 --> 00:15:54.801\nSo that brings me to the tools over here,\nthe shape tools,\n\n346\n00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:58.020\nand why we have two shape\ntools of the same thing.\n\n347\n00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.180\nI'm gonna bring these both to rectangle.\n\n348\n00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.830\nI'm also gonna pull this off so it's\nfloating a little bit, so we can see it,\n\n349\n00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.020\nit's not crammed on the side\nof the screen over there.\n\n350\n00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.890\nSo I have these two shape tools,\nI have a frame tool and a tool.\n\n351\n00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.350\nSo the frame tool says this\nis gonna put the X in it,\n\n352\n00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:16.040\nthis is going to have a graphic in it and\nthis is just a shape.\n\n353\n00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.950\nNow at any time, like I said,\nyou can switch it so it's the other.\n\n354\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.742\nSo what I do is I have one set to\nrectangle and I'm gonna click and\n\n355\n00:16:22.742 --> 00:16:23.809\nhold on this other one.\n\n356\n00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:28.534\nAnd I'm gonna set that to an ellipse so\nI always have a square or rectangle,\n\n357\n00:16:28.534 --> 00:16:31.540\nI'm sorry, a rectangle or a circle.\n\n358\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.340\nSee, there goes that geometry thing,\nI told you I'm not good at math.\n\n359\n00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.780\nSo I have those shapes ready so\nthat if I want a rectangle it's there,\n\n360\n00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.840\nif I want a circle it's there.\n\n361\n00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.980\nAnd it doesn't matter to me,\n\n362\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.250\nI don't think am I gonna put\na graphic in this or am I not?\n\n363\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.430\nI don't really care,\nI don't actually think that far ahead.\n\n364\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.660\nAll right, so\nhow do we put those frames on the page.\n\n365\n00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.250\nWell, I'm gonna actually create\na new page really quick so\n\n366\n00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.470\nI have a nice blank page to work with,\nand let's start with the graphics frame.\n\n367\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.360\nI'm gonna click on a graphics frame and\nI'm gonna click and drag.\n\n368\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.480\nAnd I can drag in any direction, I just\ngenerally click in the upper left and\n\n369\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.710\ndrag down to size.\n\n370\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.490\nNow I can also hold down the shift key\nwhich will constrain my proportions.\n\n371\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.290\nSo I want a perfect circle or\na perfect square I need to hold down\n\n372\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.430\nthe shift key for that, otherwise I\ncan just drag it to whatever size.\n\n373\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.750\nSo I come in here and let go.\n\n374\n00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.300\nAnd when I let go there's that X\nbecause I chose the graphics frame,\n\n375\n00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.050\nit says you're gonna\nput a graphic in there.\n\n376\n00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.470\nAll right, so good it's there, done,\n\n377\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.400\nI'm gonna actually delete that,\njust hit my delete key.\n\n378\n00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.610\nI can also click and drag and\n\n379\n00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.440\nmaybe where I clicked is not one of\nthe corners that I want to drag out from.\n\n380\n00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.590\nMaybe that's the center.\n\n381\n00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.710\nMaybe I know exactly where\nthe center of my object needs to be.\n\n382\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.890\nSo to do that I hold down the option or\nthe alt key and now I'm dragging and\n\n383\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.880\ndrawing from the center outwards.\n\n384\n00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.517\nI can also hold down\nthe shift key as well and\n\n385\n00:17:46.517 --> 00:17:50.775\nnow I get a perfect square also being\ndrawn from the center outwards.\n\n386\n00:17:50.775 --> 00:17:54.757\nAll right, so put that in there and\nwe can just go ahead and let go.\n\n387\n00:17:54.757 --> 00:17:57.460\nNow that's doing it visually.\n\n388\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.006\nI can also do it numerically.\n\n389\n00:17:59.006 --> 00:18:05.150\nIf I double click on the frame tool, I'm\nsorry, I'm going to click on the frame.\n\n390\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.860\nPolygons work differently, we're going\nto look at polygons in a second and\n\n391\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.260\nthey each work differently,\ndon't know why.\n\n392\n00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.960\nIf I want to do it numerically,\n\n393\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.220\nI click on the tool once then I'm\ngoing to just click on the page.\n\n394\n00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.430\nClick once on the page.\n\n395\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.690\nThen it comes up and\nsays what is your measurement.\n\n396\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.386\nSo if we know it's four by four, instead\nof me trying to do it visually I can come\n\n397\n00:18:23.386 --> 00:18:25.970\nin here numerically and say,\nthere is my four by four.\n\n398\n00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.560\nThe other thing I can do is,\nmaybe I know it is four by four and\n\n399\n00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.290\nI know exactly where\nthe center needs to be.\n\n400\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.800\nSo right where my cursor is, if I hold\ndown the option or the alt key and\n\n401\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.300\nclick once, now it will bring up the four\nby four and it still draws it from\n\n402\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.349\nthe center outwards, but to the exact\nspecifications instead of visually.\n\n403\n00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:46.020\nSame thing, exactly for the shape tool.\n\n404\n00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.635\nSame thing, were gonna draw out, we hold\ndown the shift key, we get a circle.\n\n405\n00:18:49.635 --> 00:18:53.173\nIf I hold down the Option key or\nthe Alt key it starts from the center and\n\n406\n00:18:53.173 --> 00:18:55.323\ndraws outward, exactly the same thing.\n\n407\n00:18:55.323 --> 00:18:57.660\nAll right, now you notice that\nfilled with a different color.\n\n408\n00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.633\nThat's a preference that I have set up so\n\n409\n00:18:59.633 --> 00:19:02.180\nit automatically has some\ncolor assigned to it.\n\n410\n00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.351\nWe're going to talk about color\nin a later episode but just so\n\n411\n00:19:05.351 --> 00:19:07.914\nyou know that that's\na preference I have set up.\n\n412\n00:19:07.914 --> 00:19:11.025\nWhat's weird is that if you do\nset up preferences for that and\n\n413\n00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.570\nagain I did that with no document open.\n\n414\n00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:17.080\nI filled it with a color and\nthen now every time I create a new shape\n\n415\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.030\nwith the frame tool, I'm sorry with the\nshape tool, it fills it with that color.\n\n416\n00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:25.657\nI have the same preference setup for\nthe graphics frame.\n\n417\n00:19:25.657 --> 00:19:29.394\nIt says it's gonna have this orange-yellow\ncolor in it but when I did it\n\n418\n00:19:29.394 --> 00:19:33.480\ndidn't have it, that's because\nthe graphics frame just ignores that.\n\n419\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.190\nSo don't drive yourself crazy setting\nup preference that doesn't work, so\n\n420\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.269\nit's just the nature of the beast.\n\n421\n00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.710\nNow, there's one other frame that we\ncan set up and that's a polygon frame.\n\n422\n00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:44.928\nI'm gonna click and hold and\n\n423\n00:19:44.928 --> 00:19:47.684\nagain, you can use this tool, or\nyou can use the tool next to it.\n\n424\n00:19:47.684 --> 00:19:51.283\nLike I said, they do the same thing,\nthey're just expecting different content.\n\n425\n00:19:51.283 --> 00:19:53.118\nI'm gonna come right to the polygon tool.\n\n426\n00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:55.733\nAnd when I click and\ndrag with that polygon,\n\n427\n00:19:55.733 --> 00:19:58.820\nit automatically uses\nthe last shape that I did.\n\n428\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.050\nSo the number of sides that I had and\nwhat's called a star inset or a pinch and\n\n429\n00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.962\nin this case it pinched down and\ngave me a five sided star.\n\n430\n00:20:05.962 --> 00:20:07.430\nSo I'll show you that in just a second,\n\n431\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.150\nwe're just going to use\nthe last thing that we created.\n\n432\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.150\nNow the great thing about polygons,\nI can do the same thing,\n\n433\n00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.460\nI can hold down the shift key\nto get a nice proportional item.\n\n434\n00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.120\nI can hold down the option or\nalt key to draw from the center outwards.\n\n435\n00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.670\nI can also change on\nthe fly how many sides and\n\n436\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.610\nwhat the pinches to\nthat particular object.\n\n437\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.730\nTo do that, it's a two step process\nunless you're on a very old version,\n\n438\n00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.690\nI think probably pre CS6 version,\nyou do not need to do this first step.\n\n439\n00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.820\nSo if you're CS6 or\nafterwards you have to do this first step.\n\n440\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:40.310\nHit the space bar once, and it turns off\nthis other feature that was introduced,\n\n441\n00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.180\nwhich we'll cover later.\n\n442\n00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.970\nAnd now I can use my up arrow keys,\nor my down arrow keys to add and\n\n443\n00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.220\nsubtract sides to that particular object.\n\n444\n00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.550\nI can use the right and\nleft arrow keys, so\n\n445\n00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:57.200\njust on the keyboard just the arrow keys\nthat are there, to change that star inset.\n\n446\n00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.690\nSo if I move all the way out, and\n\n447\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.030\nApple changes used to be able to\nhold it down and it would change.\n\n448\n00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.510\nNow Apple needs you to hit every\ntime you want something to change.\n\n449\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.890\nSo I'm gonna do that, just keep hitting\nit, up and down, change to the size.\n\n450\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.740\nAnd then I can still, at the last moment,\n\n451\n00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.880\nI'm still holding down the mouse key\nthe whole time I'm doing this, by the way.\n\n452\n00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.980\nI can then hold down the shift key to\nconstrain it or I can even do the option\n\n453\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.350\nor alt to draw from that center outwards,\nonce I got the perfect starburst.\n\n454\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:24.450\nLets add a bunch of sides and\nlets pinch this down and make a nice\n\n455\n00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.760\nshiny starburst there and then I let\ngo and there's my shape, ready to go.\n\n456\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.200\nNow if I don't want to do it that way,\nI can double click on the polygon tool,\n\n457\n00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.270\nagain different from the other tools,\nwe click on the tool once,\n\n458\n00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.090\nclick on the page once,\npolygon tool we double click on the tool.\n\n459\n00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:39.890\nHow many sides?\n\n460\n00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:43.883\nThat's exactly what I had last\ntime was 21 sides and a 55% pinch.\n\n461\n00:21:43.883 --> 00:21:48.150\nNow I don't know how much the percentage\nis the pinch, that's why I do it visually.\n\n462\n00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.500\nBut I can choose it that way, and\n\n463\n00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.730\nit will automatically draw\nthe last thing that I created.\n\n464\n00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.710\nSo that's polygons.\n\n465\n00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:00.730\nAll right, now we're gonna start\nputting some guides on the page.\n\n466\n00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.543\nSo now we're gonna actually tell\nit where those sit on the page.\n\n467\n00:22:04.543 --> 00:22:07.650\nI'm actually gonna jump to the next page.\n\n468\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.230\nActually, nope,\nwe'll stay on this page here.\n\n469\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.670\nI'm gonna do some stacking\norder stuff in just a second.\n\n470\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:20.040\nSo guides is just basically where I lay\nout so I know where my stuff needs to go\n\n471\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.020\nwhether it's text frames or shape frames\nor whatever, sometimes we need guides.\n\n472\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.135\nNow, we already have some\nguide set on this page.\n\n473\n00:22:26.135 --> 00:22:30.260\nWhen we set up this document,\nwe ended up with margins and\n\n474\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.305\nbleeds, those are guides they're\nthe specialized guides, but\n\n475\n00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:36.315\nwe can put all the guides we\nwant on the page as well.\n\n476\n00:22:36.315 --> 00:22:40.135\nSo to do that I'm going to come over here\nand I want to make sure my rulers are on,\n\n477\n00:22:40.135 --> 00:22:42.565\nright now I have the rulers on,\nthey should be on by default.\n\n478\n00:22:42.565 --> 00:22:46.360\nIf they are not command or\ncontrol R will turn those on and off.\n\n479\n00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.280\nHere's another great thing, and\n\n480\n00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.990\nwe're gonna do this with\nguides in just a second,\n\n481\n00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.950\nI see that it's inches across the top,\nthat's what I set up as my preferences.\n\n482\n00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.970\nI can always right click or\ncontrol click on a ruler and\n\n483\n00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.910\nchange the measurements\non the ruler right here.\n\n484\n00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.660\nMaybe, for whatever reason, I need to\nwork in centimeters at this point.\n\n485\n00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.270\nI showed you in a previous movie how you\ncan actually put in a different value\n\n486\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.880\namount and put in cm if you want to switch\nto centimeters even though you're working\n\n487\n00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.840\nin inches.\n\n488\n00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.330\nI use that if I'm doing say a drop\nshadow and I need a tiny amount,\n\n489\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.830\nI don't know tiny amounts of inches,\nright decimal parts of inches but\n\n490\n00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.190\nI do know what two millimeters looks like,\nso I might change it to that.\n\n491\n00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.420\nSo I can change the rulers\nat anytime as well.\n\n492\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.640\nRight click or control click on a ruler\nand they each work individually.\n\n493\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.400\nSo let's put some guides on the page.\n\n494\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.240\nSo I can drag out a guide by clicking\non a ruler and dragging down.\n\n495\n00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.110\nSo I'm doing a horizontal ruler.\n\n496\n00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.190\nSo I go to the, I'm sorry,\nhorizontal guide,\n\n497\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.531\nI pull it out of the horizontal ruler and\ndrag it down.\n\n498\n00:23:39.531 --> 00:23:42.472\nIf I drag off to the side you\nnotice my guides are infinite,\n\n499\n00:23:42.472 --> 00:23:44.103\nthey go across the paste board.\n\n500\n00:23:44.103 --> 00:23:45.186\nThis may or may not be helpful.\n\n501\n00:23:45.186 --> 00:23:48.009\nYou might want your guides kind\nof all contained on that page.\n\n502\n00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:49.261\nAgain it's up to you.\n\n503\n00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:50.524\nI'll just drag it to where I want.\n\n504\n00:23:50.524 --> 00:23:52.746\nAnd if you look in\nthe upper left hand corner,\n\n505\n00:23:52.746 --> 00:23:56.724\nwhich I can't point to cuz I'm holding\ndown my mouse key, but the upper left hand\n\n506\n00:23:56.724 --> 00:24:00.920\ncorner of my control panel, you notice\nthat the amount is changing the Y axis.\n\n507\n00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.860\nThere's no X axis because\nrulers are infinite so\n\n508\n00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.620\nthey only work in one direction.\n\n509\n00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.596\nSo, it's telling me exactly where it is so\nI can go, okay, let's try and\n\n510\n00:24:08.596 --> 00:24:11.620\nget this at 2 and three-quarters and\nI can let go and get it exactly there.\n\n511\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.860\nNow the great thing is if\nI'm not that accurate?\n\n512\n00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.702\nI'm gonna undo that, Cmd or Ctrl+Z,\nand I dropped it on the page and\n\n513\n00:24:16.702 --> 00:24:19.510\nrealize I want that to be at 2 and\nthree-quarters.\n\n514\n00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.283\nI can make sure it's selected and\n\n515\n00:24:21.283 --> 00:24:24.333\nI know it's selected because\nmy ruler is this dark blue.\n\n516\n00:24:24.333 --> 00:24:26.217\nIf I click off of it, it's the cyan.\n\n517\n00:24:26.217 --> 00:24:29.792\nAnd that's because each layer,\nwe're gonna look at layers later on,\n\n518\n00:24:29.792 --> 00:24:32.175\nbut each layer has a different\ncolor code to it so\n\n519\n00:24:32.175 --> 00:24:35.468\nI can see that I'm on this base layer and\nthat's that light blue.\n\n520\n00:24:35.468 --> 00:24:38.207\nSo, I can put that there and say,\nokay, I really want to select that.\n\n521\n00:24:38.207 --> 00:24:40.400\nWell, I can either just roll over it,\nand again,\n\n522\n00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.800\nI get that mouse with a little\nplus that's on there.\n\n523\n00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.420\nLet's zoom in so we can see that.\n\n524\n00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.240\nSo, as I roll over an item, it turns on,\nit shows me something is selected.\n\n525\n00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.400\nAll right, so I can select that,\nor I can just drag across it.\n\n526\n00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.430\nSo, I drag across it,\nhave that guide selected.\n\n527\n00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.797\nNow I can come up here and say,\nI actually want it to be 2 and\n\n528\n00:24:56.797 --> 00:25:01.460\nthree-quarters, I can actually put the\nexact amount there, 2 and three-quarters.\n\n529\n00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.620\nNow I can do pretty much anything to\na guide that I do with other objects.\n\n530\n00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.380\nI can step and repeat that if I\nwant it to be every quarter inch or\n\n531\n00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.510\nsomething like that.\n\n532\n00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.410\nI can move it if I decide\nI don't like where it is.\n\n533\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.860\nI can change the value here,\nI can move it around.\n\n534\n00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.650\nWhat I need to do when I want to get\nrid of it though, is select it and\n\n535\n00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.480\nI can just hit Delete.\n\n536\n00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.380\nThere is three or\nfour other ways to get rid of guides,\n\n537\n00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.010\nthat's the simplest way, I think.\n\n538\n00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.060\nNow if I have objects on the page.\n\n539\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.030\nLet's come back to this\npage with some objects.\n\n540\n00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:29.120\nAnd I put a couple rulers and\nI'm gonna drag a ruler out here.\n\n541\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.480\nLet me actually drag a ruler.\n\n542\n00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.740\nWhy is it not letting\nme drag a ruler here?\n\n543\n00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.950\nThat's interesting.\n\n544\n00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.242\nAll right, let's try it over here.\n\n545\n00:25:39.242 --> 00:25:41.406\nI have no idea why it's\nnot letting me drag.\n\n546\n00:25:41.406 --> 00:25:42.500\nThere we go.\n\n547\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.272\nIt was just tired.\n\n548\n00:25:43.272 --> 00:25:48.150\nAll right, so there it is, I drag a couple\nof ruler guides that are out there and\n\n549\n00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.670\nI want to select those guides.\n\n550\n00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.370\nWell if I select over here,\nI can select those guides individually.\n\n551\n00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:58.010\nIf I drag across the guides and\nan object, only my object got selected.\n\n552\n00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.054\nAnd that's because it\nfavors objects over guides,\n\n553\n00:26:00.054 --> 00:26:02.492\nbecause you wouldn't want to\nmove everything together.\n\n554\n00:26:02.492 --> 00:26:03.490\nThat kinda defeats the whole\n\n555\n00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.410\npurpose of putting guides on\nyour page in the first place.\n\n556\n00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.733\nSo, just know that if that you're\ntrying to select guides and\n\n557\n00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:11.210\nyou've got objects there, you're gonna\nneed to probably individually select them.\n\n558\n00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:15.160\nSo, like with any other item, and\nthis works across the Adobe spectrum.\n\n559\n00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.450\nSo that's why I haven't mentioned it,\nbut I will now.\n\n560\n00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.580\nIf I select something and hit Shift and\nSelect, I can select multiple items.\n\n561\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.220\nSo I can either drag across multiple\nitems or Shift+Select each of those.\n\n562\n00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.350\nSo I selected the guides.\n\n563\n00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.020\nI delete those, but\nmy objects are still there left behind.\n\n564\n00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.028\nSo those are guides.\n\n565\n00:26:31.028 --> 00:26:33.970\nI call these dumb guides now though\nbecause a few versions back,\n\n566\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.220\nthey introduced what's\ncalled Smart Guides.\n\n567\n00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.800\nAnd Smart Guides are cool because they\nwork contextually and on the fly.\n\n568\n00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.740\nAs I'm creating items,\nit shows me how things line up.\n\n569\n00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.040\nSo, it's kind of good and it's kind of\nbad, because I've always been the stickler\n\n570\n00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.460\nfor everything lining up perfectly, and\nhaving everything laid out beautifully.\n\n571\n00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.430\nAnd, designers, I do a lot of work for\n\n572\n00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.210\ndesigners, I do their production work for\nthem.\n\n573\n00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.320\nAnd, they like to just\nthrow things on the page.\n\n574\n00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.970\nThis kind of gives you a happy medium,\nit lets you throw things on the page but\n\n575\n00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.170\nyou also know when those\nthings are lined up.\n\n576\n00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:06.490\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and create an item.\n\n577\n00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.670\nGrab the rectangle here.\n\n578\n00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.140\nAnd I'm just gonna draw out the size.\n\n579\n00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.740\nAnd them I'm gonna use the selection tool.\n\n580\n00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.080\nSo, I actually grab this item.\n\n581\n00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.180\nAnd I wanna see where that sits.\n\n582\n00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.420\nAnd I want to put another\nitem on the page, and\n\n583\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.290\nI want it to be the same height,\nor the same width, or whatever.\n\n584\n00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.437\nSo I'm gonna grab another item.\n\n585\n00:27:23.437 --> 00:27:25.099\nAnd I'm just gonna start drawing.\n\n586\n00:27:25.099 --> 00:27:26.050\nAnd hopefully you'll be able to see it.\n\n587\n00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.005\nIf not, I might have to zoom in.\n\n588\n00:27:27.005 --> 00:27:31.159\nBut when I get to the same height,\nI get these little green arrows.\n\n589\n00:27:31.159 --> 00:27:33.278\nSo, actually,\nI'm gonna zoom in really quick.\n\n590\n00:27:33.278 --> 00:27:34.160\nI'm gonna undo that.\n\n591\n00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.197\nThen I'm gonna zoom in so\nwe can see that for sure.\n\n592\n00:27:36.197 --> 00:27:40.130\nI'm showing this cuz I feel like I'm\ngonna get sea sick if I move too much.\n\n593\n00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.980\nSo, let's do that.\n\n594\n00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.060\nYou can see where it shows you where it's\nlined up with the bottom of that object.\n\n595\n00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.070\nThen I get this pink one.\n\n596\n00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:48.580\nThat shows me that's the center\nof the page as well.\n\n597\n00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.405\nAnd then, when I get to the same height,\n\n598\n00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:52.358\nyou can see that green\narrow that shows up.\n\n599\n00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:55.472\nSo it's telling me that it's the same\nexact height as the object that's nearby.\n\n600\n00:27:55.472 --> 00:27:58.033\nAnd then I can do the same thing\nwhen it hits the width as well.\n\n601\n00:27:58.033 --> 00:27:59.934\nIf you have not had much\ncaffeine you can do this.\n\n602\n00:27:59.934 --> 00:28:00.724\nThere we go.\n\n603\n00:28:00.724 --> 00:28:02.622\nIt's the same width and the same height.\n\n604\n00:28:02.622 --> 00:28:03.947\nWe're gonna zoom back out now.\n\n605\n00:28:03.947 --> 00:28:07.110\nAnd I could have copied and\npasted that one.\n\n606\n00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.420\nBut where that comes in handy is\nif I want them to look different.\n\n607\n00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.150\nI just wanna make sure that they're\nthe same height and same width.\n\n608\n00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.470\nSo I'm actually going to cheat now and\ncopy and paste that second item.\n\n609\n00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.900\nSo I'm gonna throw this guy off here,\nand this guy here.\n\n610\n00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.870\nI'm gonna do copy and paste.\n\n611\n00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.730\nCmd+ or Ctrl+C to copy.\n\n612\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.000\nCmd+ or Ctrl+V to paste.\n\n613\n00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.170\nAnd what I wanna do is I wanna\nmake sure that this item,\n\n614\n00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.010\neven though this is not\nthe same stair step value,\n\n615\n00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.950\nI want to know that the width,\nthe separation is the same.\n\n616\n00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.020\nSo when I do that, I get these little\nguides along the bottom that shows me that\n\n617\n00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.020\nthe gap between those\nitems is exactly the same.\n\n618\n00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.310\nSo that's Smart Guides, it shows me\nall the time as I'm laying things out.\n\n619\n00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.765\nI can say, okay, I want this\nitem to be centered on the page.\n\n620\n00:28:44.765 --> 00:28:47.560\nIt's centered left to right, and\nnow it's centered top to bottom.\n\n621\n00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.350\nSo now I know it's sitting\nexactly in the center of the page\n\n622\n00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.120\nbecause I'm using those Smart Guides.\n\n623\n00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.670\nThe other things that we can see\nwhen we're doing that is we can see\n\n624\n00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:55.770\nvalues turned on.\n\n625\n00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.760\nAlthough it's not,\nthat might be off by default now.\n\n626\n00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.710\nI'm gonna go into my preferences and\nshow you how to turn on and\n\n627\n00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.460\noff the different Smart Guides, and\nSmart Guides are on by default.\n\n628\n00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.160\nYou can turn them off entirely\nif you don't want to see all\n\n629\n00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.600\nthose lines flashing on and off.\n\n630\n00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.380\nThat can be kind of confusing\nwhen you have a lot of objects.\n\n631\n00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.923\nBecause if you have ten objects on there,\nevery time it gets to the size of one of\n\n632\n00:29:14.923 --> 00:29:17.841\nthe other objects,\nyou're gonna get that flash of that guide.\n\n633\n00:29:17.841 --> 00:29:22.566\nSo, I'm gonna go into my preferences,\nInDesign > Preferences on a Mac,\n\n634\n00:29:22.566 --> 00:29:24.368\nEdit > Preferences on a PC.\n\n635\n00:29:24.368 --> 00:29:27.697\nAnd I am gonna come down to Guides and\nPasteboard.\n\n636\n00:29:27.697 --> 00:29:29.940\nAnd down at the bottom here,\nSmart Guide Options.\n\n637\n00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.720\nSo align to object center and edges,\nthat's what we were just doing was\n\n638\n00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.760\nthe center,\nshowed us when it was lined up to that,\n\n639\n00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.840\nwhen it was lined up to\nthe other object's edges.\n\n640\n00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.650\nSmart dimensions is turned on,\n\n641\n00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:43.220\nit was not displaying so that might\nbe something with this new version.\n\n642\n00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.100\nIt might be a bug.\n\n643\n00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.870\nYou'll find this, what it should show you\nis a little box that shows you how wide\n\n644\n00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.240\nand how tall that object is.\n\n645\n00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.160\nOr if you're rotating an object,\nwhat the rotation value is.\n\n646\n00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.960\nShould be a little gray box.\n\n647\n00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.148\nI tend to have that turned off because\nthat's just too much information for me.\n\n648\n00:29:56.148 --> 00:29:59.672\nAnd also smart spacing, that's where\nwe set up those three items and\n\n649\n00:29:59.672 --> 00:30:01.550\nhow much gap was between each.\n\n650\n00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.914\nYou can decide which\nthings you want to show.\n\n651\n00:30:03.914 --> 00:30:08.539\nBut we can also turn on and off Smart\nGuides altogether if you right-click or\n\n652\n00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:10.570\nor Ctrl+click on the artboard.\n\n653\n00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.667\nDon't have anything selected\nwhen you do this, right-click or\n\n654\n00:30:13.667 --> 00:30:18.010\nCtrl+click come down to Grids & Guides and\nyou can turn on or off Smart Guides here.\n\n655\n00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.190\nSo, if you want them off altogether,\njust turn them off.\n\n656\n00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.010\nSo, the nice thing is I leave all the\noptions selected, I can turn it off when\n\n657\n00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.550\nI don't want it, turn it right back on but\nall my options are still there exactly.\n\n658\n00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:31.490\nAnd again, that smart dimensions should be\nshowing a little gray box as we drag and\n\n659\n00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.100\nit's not for whatever reason.\n\n660\n00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.091\nSo we're gonna call that a bug,\nnot a feature.\n\n661\n00:30:35.091 --> 00:30:37.406\nAnd yeah, so that's Smart Guide.\n\n662\n00:30:37.406 --> 00:30:40.516\nSo I can actually work really quickly,\nstart pasting things together and\n\n663\n00:30:40.516 --> 00:30:42.420\nknow that things are lined up well.\n\n664\n00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.000\nBut I can do it sort of haphazardly but\nnot exactly.\n\n665\n00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.080\nThat's kind of putting\nsome elements on the page.\n\n666\n00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.580\nWe got our guides to figure out\nwhere elements need to go and\n\n667\n00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.790\nwe know how to draw some simple elements.\n\n668\n00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.380\nSo we'll start making some changes to\nthose simple elements in a future episode.\n\n669\n00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.990\n>> I can see where those smart guides\nwould definitely assist you in\n\n670\n00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.680\nmaking things look a little\nbit more symmetric.\n\n671\n00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.450\nNow it does look like we are coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n672\n00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:07.180\nBut Erica, before we sign out, do you have\nany additional words you'd like to say?\n\n673\n00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.860\n>> No, I think we've pretty much said\neverything we need to about elements.\n\n674\n00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.870\nSo we're just ready to put some more\nstuff into those elements soon.\n\n675\n00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.720\n>> Well, that's great and\nI look forward to seeing you.\n\n676\n00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.231\nThank you for joining us in the studio and\n\n677\n00:31:16.231 --> 00:31:18.020\nthank you to the viewer out there for\nwatching.\n\n678\n00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.949\nSigning out

00:00:16.260\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.740\nAnd in today's episode we're\ncontinuing through our series in\n\n5\n00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.490\nthe Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n6\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.310\nMore specifically,\nwe're diving into InDesign.\n\n7\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.220\nAnd joining me in the studios for\nthis endeavor is Erica Gamet.\n\n8\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.100\nErica, how you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.090\n>> Good, Wes.\nHow are you?\n\n10\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.215\n>> All right.\nGreat today.\n\n11\n00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:31.765\nAnd so, what is the next topic that\nwe're gonna be looking at today?\n\n12\n00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.075\n>> We're gonna start in\nwith some frames and paths.\n\n13\n00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.395\nSo we're gonna take some of\nthe elements that we've created and\n\n14\n00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:38.725\nwe're gonna start doing stuff to them.\n\n15\n00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:41.740\nTransforming them,\nmoving them around on a page.\n\n16\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.940\nAnd then we're also going\nto work with paths as well,\n\n17\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.500\nwhich is kind of what\nour frames are made of.\n\n18\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.252\nSo we're gonna go ahead and jump in.\n\n19\n00:00:47.252 --> 00:00:51.240\nI'm gonna jump into a file that\nI've used recently called elements.\n\n20\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.730\nWe've got some elements on the page, and\n\n21\n00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.520\nI'm gonna jump to a page here, this page,\nunassigned frames and polygons.\n\n22\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.520\nI talked about the different\ntypes of frames.\n\n23\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.930\nWe have graphics frames,\nand just playing frames,\n\n24\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.130\nor unassigned frames is\nwhat they call them.\n\n25\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.790\nWe can just call them shapes,\nthat's what I usually call them.\n\n26\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.690\nAnd we're gonna make changes to them, and\n\n27\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.500\nit doesn't matter if they're graphics\nframes or if there shapes frames.\n\n28\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.660\nThis is just how we adjust\nelements that are on the page.\n\n29\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.820\nSo we do things like resize them,\nmove them, and\n\n30\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.710\nthen we're gonna start\nputting stuff into them soon.\n\n31\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.945\nAll right, so\nlet's just take a look at some of those.\n\n32\n00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:26.730\nI'm using a keyboard shortcut you can see,\nhopefully.\n\n33\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.580\nIts Cmd+Space, or Ctrl+Space on a PC, and\nit just brings up the marquee zoom, so\n\n34\n00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.600\nwhen I slide across it I can\nactually zoom in on that item.\n\n35\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.810\nYou will notice, though,\nI get the spotlight search that comes up.\n\n36\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.420\nThat's a Mac thing,\nit uses the same keyboard shortcut,\n\n37\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.350\nwhich is a little annoying, I know,\nbut just pretend that the spotlight\n\n38\n00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.900\none doesn't come up there because I do\nhave to have both of those on there.\n\n39\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.940\nAll right, so let's modify them.\n\n40\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.480\nI've got a frame, like I said.\n\n41\n00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.648\nI created that using the frame tool.\n\n42\n00:01:50.648 --> 00:01:53.575\nSo we come over here to the frame tool,\nI've got the shape tool and\n\n43\n00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:57.415\nthe graphics shaper, the graphics frame\ntool, or each one is individually named,\n\n44\n00:01:57.415 --> 00:01:59.605\nthe rectangle, the ellipse, the polygon.\n\n45\n00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:02.075\nSo, you can basically call it\ngraphics frame, and just a frame.\n\n46\n00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:04.950\nThat's, I tend to put it that way.\n\n47\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.640\nSo, to select either one,\nwe drew a frame by clicking,\n\n48\n00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.710\ndragging and drawing out that shape.\n\n49\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.580\nI'm gonna delete that cuz I\nalready have one here, and\n\n50\n00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.850\nI'm gonna use the Selection tool.\n\n51\n00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.660\nI mentioned in a very, very early episode,\nthat we have two Selection tools.\n\n52\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.910\nWe have a Selection tool and\na Direct Selection tool.\n\n53\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.830\nAnd the Selection tool,\nor the solid arrow or\n\n54\n00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.680\nthe black arrow, is used for\ngrabbing or selecting or\n\n55\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.870\nmodifying a container, a frame, as\nopposed to the content within that frame.\n\n56\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.520\nSo, for this demonstration,\n\n57\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.260\nwe're just going to go ahead and\nselect the frame itself and work with it.\n\n58\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.190\nSo when I use the Selection tool,\n\n59\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.580\nI'm gonna just click on\nanywhere on that graphic.\n\n60\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.110\nNow, I can click in the middle.\n\n61\n00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.510\nAnd you notice, it didn't get selected.\n\n62\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.140\nHopefully, you can see that, that it\ndidn't, as opposed to when I select here.\n\n63\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.960\nI get my handles that show up,\nand it's selected.\n\n64\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.030\nWhen I click in the middle, it did not.\n\n65\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.690\nAnd that's because I have this frame, and\nif I click on it, I can look down here,\n\n66\n00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.010\nand we're gonna go into color and\nfills and strokes in a future episode.\n\n67\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.590\nBut I can see just by looking at that,\nthat I have no fill, and\n\n68\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.670\nI have a stroke,\nwhich means I have the line around it.\n\n69\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.270\nAnd because I have nothing in the middle,\nwhen I click in the middle,\n\n70\n00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.720\nif I just click in the middle,\nit's like nothing's there.\n\n71\n00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.770\nIt's just basically this big,\nempty frame, so\n\n72\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.520\nwhen I'm clicking,\nI'm clicking the page back behind it.\n\n73\n00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.040\nSo I need to be aware of that,\nthat to select an item,\n\n74\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.300\nI either need to click on the frame edges\nor I can click and drag across items.\n\n75\n00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.320\nI can click and\ndrag across multiple items that way.\n\n76\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.815\nSo, if I wanted to drag across everything,\nI could do that.\n\n77\n00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:38.440\nSo, to select just one item,\nthough, I'm just gonna click on it.\n\n78\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.220\nAnd again, when I do that,\nI'm gonna zoom in so you can see that,\n\n79\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.250\nwhen I roll over an item, and\nI have something that can be selected,\n\n80\n00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.170\nI get that little square at\nthe bottom that tells me something\n\n81\n00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.690\nis underneath my cursor and\nready to be clicked on.\n\n82\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.780\nSo when I click on it,\nnow that's selected.\n\n83\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.480\nGonna zoom back out.\n\n84\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.260\nSo I have that Item selected,\nI now have the grab handles, and\n\n85\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.460\nthere's nine grab handles.\n\n86\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.620\nThere's three across the top,\nthree across the bottom.\n\n87\n00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.210\nAnd the sides, and\nI also have this one here.\n\n88\n00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.780\nSo just the one in the middle.\n\n89\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.940\nSo, even though I don' have anything\ntechnically to grab in the middle,\n\n90\n00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.120\nI can when I select that, I can grab\nit by that center and move it as well.\n\n91\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.730\nBut I can't just grab anywhere.\n\n92\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.430\nIf I grab here, again,\nI'm just clicking through that.\n\n93\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.930\nSo I'm gonna click and drag, and I'm\ngonna grab one of these corner handles.\n\n94\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.830\nI'm gong to ignore this blue one and\nthis yellow one.\n\n95\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.520\nThos are special.\n\n96\n00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.870\nAnd they keep adding them.\n\n97\n00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.740\nI keep joking that by CC22 or whatever,\n\n98\n00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.962\nwe're going to have Christmas lights all\nthe way around the whole outside of that.\n\n99\n00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:36.740\nBecause there's always something new\nthat they're adding to the outside.\n\n100\n00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.080\nThe ones we're going to work with,\nare these hollow ones on the corner and\n\n101\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.750\nin the center of each line.\n\n102\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.370\nSo, basically, to size an object,\nit's pretty easy.\n\n103\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.960\nI can grab it by the corner, and\nI get that double headed arrow.\n\n104\n00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.040\nZoom in so you can see that as well.\n\n105\n00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.590\nSo I get that double headed arrow\nwhen I get close to a corner.\n\n106\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.840\nAnd InDesign's smart enough, it says,\nyou're near a corner, let's change it.\n\n107\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.224\nBut it changes to something else here, and\n\n108\n00:04:58.224 --> 00:04:59.750\nwe're gonna look at that\nin a minute as well.\n\n109\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.850\nSo, depending on how close we are to what,\nit changes.\n\n110\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.820\nSo, I don't have to change between tools,\nI'm just still using the Selection tool.\n\n111\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.330\nAll right, so I'm gonna zoom back out.\n\n112\n00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.850\nI can grab that, and I can drag in.\n\n113\n00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.870\nNow, I can either drag really quickly, and\n\n114\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.550\ndepending on the preferences that I have\nset up and how quick your system is,\n\n115\n00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.610\nyou may or may not actually see\nit being drawn as you drag.\n\n116\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.780\nSo, if I click and drag, you might\nnot see anything until you let go.\n\n117\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.140\nIf that's the case,\nif you click and hold for\n\n118\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.900\na split second, then start dragging,\nyou will actually see the outline of that.\n\n119\n00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.430\nSo again, it's all set on preferences and\nyour processor speed.\n\n120\n00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.320\nBut if you're not seeing what you need,\na lot of times just stop and hold it for\n\n121\n00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.470\na second, and\nthen you'll get this live preview.\n\n122\n00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.550\nSo we can size it that way.\n\n123\n00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.610\nI can obviously just size\nit by one side or another.\n\n124\n00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.190\nSo if I use the side handles\nas opposed to the corner,\n\n125\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.850\nI'm only moving it in one direction.\n\n126\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.200\nSo I can move that.\n\n127\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.590\nI can also hold down\nthe Option on the Alt key and\n\n128\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.197\nhave it just like when we drew it from\nthe center outwards using the Option or\n\n129\n00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:06.100\nAlt key, I can also resize\nit from the center inwards.\n\n130\n00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.250\nSo if I'm grabbing a corner handle and\nholding the Option key, or\n\n131\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.190\nAlt key on the PC, I can come in here,\nand when I drag in,\n\n132\n00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.740\nit's now sizing down from all sides\nbecause I'm choosing the corner.\n\n133\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.920\nSo, it's coming on all sides,\nit's being drawn in.\n\n134\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.070\nBut it's doing it from the center inward.\n\n135\n00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.920\nIf I hold on a Shift key at the same time,\nit's drawing it proportionally.\n\n136\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.650\nSo, it works exactly the opposite\nas we created the item.\n\n137\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.900\nNow, I can resize it using the same Option\nor Alt key and the Shift key as well.\n\n138\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.920\nIf I drag from the side and\nhold on the Option key,\n\n139\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.090\nit's only going to bring in the two sides,\nbut again, from the center outwards.\n\n140\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.690\nThat's the Option or the Alt key on a PC.\n\n141\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.515\nAnd so\nthat's pretty much how we resize items.\n\n142\n00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:50.765\nDo the same thing here if I select this.\n\n143\n00:06:50.765 --> 00:06:55.815\nNow, you notice this one, I selected a\ncircle but I still have a rectangular box.\n\n144\n00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:59.345\nSo I said before that everything\nin InDesign lives in a frame.\n\n145\n00:06:59.345 --> 00:07:03.860\nWell, those frames are all technically\nrectangular, even circles.\n\n146\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.040\nEven stars.\n\n147\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.480\nIt's called a bounding box.\n\n148\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.870\nSo everything lives inside this bounding\nbox, and it has to be rectangular.\n\n149\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.710\nSo when I size this down, I'm still\ngonna grab these corner handles, even\n\n150\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.420\nthough I'm really changing the size of the\ncircle, without manipulating the shape.\n\n151\n00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.810\nIt's still circular.\n\n152\n00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.690\nSame thing, hold down the Shift key and\nit's proportional.\n\n153\n00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.140\nIf I hold a second,\nI can actually see as I drag it.\n\n154\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.850\nHold on the Option or the ALT key, and\nit drags it, draws it from the center.\n\n155\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.720\nGo to the Option key,\nkeep the Shift key selected,\n\n156\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.270\nI get a proportion,\nsame thing with the polygon.\n\n157\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.373\nOne of the other things we can do\nwith a polygon, oris we can also, or\n\n158\n00:07:39.373 --> 00:07:42.220\nany shape,\nwe can change it to another shape.\n\n159\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.510\nSo if I go up into the object menu and\ncome down to convert shape,\n\n160\n00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.110\nI can now convert this\nstar to something else.\n\n161\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.800\nI can convert it to an ellipse.\n\n162\n00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.950\nSo it's suddenly a circle, and\nit's always gonna fill the bounding box.\n\n163\n00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.530\nSo that might not look great.\n\n164\n00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.268\nIf I undo that,\n\n165\n00:07:55.268 --> 00:07:59.130\nCmd- or Ctrl-Z to go backwards, that looks\nlike a pretty proportional star to me.\n\n166\n00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.620\nIt looks like pretty good, right?\n\n167\n00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.226\nIt's exactly the same on all sides.\n\n168\n00:08:02.226 --> 00:08:06.011\nBut when I converted that to a circle, you\ncould see that it was slightly flattened.\n\n169\n00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:07.678\nIt wasn't quite a perfect circle.\n\n170\n00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:10.691\nSo whenever I made that I obviously\ndidn't hold down my Shift key, but\n\n171\n00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.185\nconverting shape is pretty easy.\n\n172\n00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:15.521\nI can choose to have it convert to\na polygon, and when I do that you think,\n\n173\n00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:17.110\nwell it was a polygon.\n\n174\n00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.040\nIt automatically uses the last\ninput that we did when we created.\n\n175\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.930\nThe last time I created a polygon\nwe made a starburst, and so\n\n176\n00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.120\nthat's what worked its\nway into that as well.\n\n177\n00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.330\nSo I can always change that.\n\n178\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.170\nI can also change it if I wanna change\nto the polygon-shaped tool here.\n\n179\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.310\nI can double click on that and\nI can change the size.\n\n180\n00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:40.100\nLet's do that, and we'll say 20, change\nthat I can change that after the fact if I\n\n181\n00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.990\ndidnt like how many sides there were.\n\n182\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.770\nBecause when I drew that I was able to use\nmy up and down arrow keys to add sides and\n\n183\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.560\nthat star pinch that was there.\n\n184\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.510\nI can't change it manually like\nthat anymore once it's on the page,\n\n185\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.900\nI can only do it numerically.\n\n186\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.730\nSo, just keep that in mind when you're\ndrawing out your polygons make sure that\n\n187\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.100\nit's pretty close to\nwhat you want otherwise,\n\n188\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.972\nyou're gonna have to keep going,\nno maybe forty-percent, maybe forty-two,\n\n189\n00:09:01.972 --> 00:09:03.880\nmaybe forty-four,\nwe have to keep changing that.\n\n190\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.570\nSo that's how we can change polygons and\nactually manipulate them.\n\n191\n00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.510\nWe can also set where\na transformation happens, and\n\n192\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.910\nactually let me do one\nmore transformation.\n\n193\n00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.810\nI'm gonna make this a little smaller.\n\n194\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.320\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit so we can\nget this kind of full on our page, and\n\n195\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.180\nI told you that it's smart enough\nto change the tool for you.\n\n196\n00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.000\nSo again,\nI've still got the selection tool.\n\n197\n00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.730\nI've selected the frame, and\nI do wanna size it, maybe I size it.\n\n198\n00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.850\nOkay, whoops, I just showed\nyou what I was gonna show you.\n\n199\n00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.260\nI took my own thunder.\n\n200\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.830\nWhat I wanted to do is just\nchange this a little bit.\n\n201\n00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.360\nAnd then I say okay,\nnow I've got the size that I think,\n\n202\n00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.670\nI want to rotate it a little bit so\nI'm going to move off of it slightly and\n\n203\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.420\nhopefully you can see that I'll zoom\nin just a little bit, so you can.\n\n204\n00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.050\nGoing to change to that double headed\ncurved arrow that's the rotate arrow, and\n\n205\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.910\nI can use the rotate tool,\nI'll show you that in a minute.\n\n206\n00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.320\nBut I don't have to\nthat's the great thing,\n\n207\n00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.380\nit says you're near\nthe corner lets Size it.\n\n208\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.680\nYou're off the corner a little bit,\nlet's rotate it.\n\n209\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.210\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n210\n00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.010\nI'm gonna start rotating.\n\n211\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.990\nI'm gonna click and hold so\nI can actually see it happening, and\n\n212\n00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.320\nI can see the little angle line,\nit actually shows me.\n\n213\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.950\nAnd again my transformations\nare obviously not working with\n\n214\n00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.860\nthis version of it where it's\nshowing me what angle it is, but\n\n215\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.850\nI can keep an eye up in the upper left\ncorner here in the Control Panel.\n\n216\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.890\nIt does show me what the angle is.\n\n217\n00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.830\nI can manually type that in as well, if I\nknow exactly what angle that needs to be.\n\n218\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.540\nI'm gonna do that just so\nit brings it back to where I had it.\n\n219\n00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.630\nThe other thing I can do is I can\ntell it how that transformation,\n\n220\n00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.520\nwhere that transformation.\n\n221\n00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.450\nHow.\n\n222\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.840\nSorry.\nWhere the transformation works around.\n\n223\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.015\nEnglish is hard sometimes.\n\n224\n00:10:32.015 --> 00:10:35.710\nOkay, so you know, I tell it where\nto start that transformation.\n\n225\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.900\nSo in this case, with the rotate.\n\n226\n00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.020\nI'm going to just start rotating and you\nnotice it's rotating on its center axis,\n\n227\n00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.740\nthat's the default, but I can change that.\n\n228\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.870\nBecause maybe I like\nwhere it's sitting and\n\n229\n00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.700\nI want to rock it up\njust on the right side.\n\n230\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.020\nI didn't want to completely spin around\nbecause maybe it's sitting on the bottom\n\n231\n00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.740\nof my page, let us actually put it,\nwe decide we want it here at the top\n\n232\n00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.020\nagainst that guide and when push that item\nagainst the guide it snap into place,\n\n233\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.250\nnot to mentioned that's the default\nbehavior, it snaps to guides.\n\n234\n00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.580\nThink that pretty common\nin most applications but\n\n235\n00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.760\nthat is the case here as well So\nI moved it up.\n\n236\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.690\nI said, great it to center and I want\nit to be angled, but I don't want it\n\n237\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.970\nto angle it around the center because\nit will push it outside that guide.\n\n238\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.760\nI wanna drop it own on one side.\n\n239\n00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.240\nSo I'm going to come over and\n\n240\n00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.210\nI'm gonna tell it I want it\nto rotate on this corner.\n\n241\n00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.400\nSo what I'm gonna do, is that I can\ngo ahead and choose the rotate tool.\n\n242\n00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.430\nNow I have to choose the tool for this.\n\n243\n00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.420\nOtherwise I can't choose\nmy transformation point.\n\n244\n00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.060\nSo I'm going to click the rotate tool and\n\n245\n00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:35.000\nif I don't see it What you will\nsee is this transform tool.\n\n246\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.040\nAlright?\nSo we got this tool here,\n\n247\n00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.420\nthe free transform tool and it's one\nof the hidden tools when I click and\n\n248\n00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.860\nhold on it I get the rotate tool.\n\n249\n00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.920\nSo I choose the tool and\nnow when I come here and click,\n\n250\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.580\nif I click in the center, zoom in here so\nwe can actually see that,\n\n251\n00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.030\nhopefully we can see the teeny\ntiny little target that's there.\n\n252\n00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.180\nWell what I want to do is I want to\nclick and drag on this, and depending on\n\n253\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.480\nthe version that you have, it used to be\nthat I could just click anywhere, and\n\n254\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.430\nit would move the transformation tool.\n\n255\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.160\nThen they switched,\nthen I think they switched back, and\n\n256\n00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.520\nI think they switched back again.\n\n257\n00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.190\nI've lost count, but if it doesn't work\nthis way, if it doesn't work for clicking,\n\n258\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.060\nyou may have to actually go and\ngrab where it is and drag it.\n\n259\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.120\nSo I'm actually holding down my mouse and\ndragging it.\n\n260\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.700\nSo let's drag it here and\nsay we want to drag it to this corner or\n\n261\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.590\neven not in the corner.\n\n262\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.640\nIt doesn't have to be on\none of the handles at all.\n\n263\n00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.280\nI can say I really like\nwhere it's sitting here.\n\n264\n00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.040\nIf I do that it's going to rock\nup slightly in this place.\n\n265\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.915\nIf not, if I put it here and snap it to\nthe corner, it's only going to rock down.\n\n266\n00:12:26.915 --> 00:12:27.715\nSo, I'll zoom back out.\n\n267\n00:12:27.715 --> 00:12:30.455\nSo, I've told it, that's where\nthe transformation takes place.\n\n268\n00:12:30.455 --> 00:12:34.985\nNow, when I come over here and grab this,\nor put in a numerical number and I rotate,\n\n269\n00:12:34.985 --> 00:12:37.125\nnow it's happening off of that corner.\n\n270\n00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:39.911\nSo, I've told it where\nthe transformation point needs to be.\n\n271\n00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:42.520\nSo, we always have control over that.\n\n272\n00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.010\nSo you can tell where that happens.\n\n273\n00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.380\nSame thing with the sizing as well where\nyou move the transformation point around,\n\n274\n00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.360\nand it can be anywhere.\n\n275\n00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.630\nIt might be something where\nyou have an image and\n\n276\n00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.140\nyou say have a mountain ranger or\nsomething.\n\n277\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.800\nAnd you want some words going up\nthe side of the mountain range, and\n\n278\n00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.320\nyou'd like to angle it based on the angle\nof the mountains or something like that.\n\n279\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.390\nYou want to run up the side of the\nmountain, you can set the transformation\n\n280\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.740\npoint on that mountain, and\nrotate your text up to fit there as well.\n\n281\n00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.070\nSo you're not limited to what's there.\n\n282\n00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.100\nThat's the transformation point.\n\n283\n00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.180\nWe can also skew.\n\n284\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.700\nI'm gonna go ahead and reset this.\n\n285\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.650\nI'm just gonna go up to the rotation\nof value amount here and\n\n286\n00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.190\nset that back to zero.\n\n287\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.440\nSo we're back to where we were.\n\n288\n00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.720\nI'm gonna move it down\na little bit as well.\n\n289\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.050\nWell, yeah, we don't grab it\nexactly right it just said nope,\n\n290\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.530\nyou didn't grab anything, you just poked\nright through to the page behind it.\n\n291\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.420\nSo I grabbed it by the frame this time.\n\n292\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.960\nYou can also share and\ntransform it that way.\n\n293\n00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.630\nThe free transform tool,\nI don't use this very\n\n294\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.340\noften anymore because this is\nbasically what it does on it's own.\n\n295\n00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.420\nIt says if you If you're near\nthe corner it's a drag handle.\n\n296\n00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.940\nIf you're near or off the corner\na little bit it's a rotation tool.\n\n297\n00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.690\nSo we used to have to go to a special\ntool that gave us two tools.\n\n298\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:59.720\nNow it kind of built that into\nthe arrow forming the selection arrow.\n\n299\n00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.630\nBut like I said if you want to change\nthe transformation point you do need\n\n300\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.550\nto pick the tool, so\nsomething you will need to use that tool.\n\n301\n00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.890\nI don't use it very often But\nI'm gonna come dow here to the Scale tool.\n\n302\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.840\nAnd the scale tool is basically\nwhat we've been using is that we\n\n303\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.210\ncan just scale items.\n\n304\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.040\nWhoops.\nUp and down.\n\n305\n00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.330\nI clicked on that.\n\n306\n00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.740\nI wanna actually drag my transformation\npoint back to the center.\n\n307\n00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.590\nAnd it will snap into place when\nyou get close to the center.\n\n308\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.610\nSo I can change that and\nscale it that way.\n\n309\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.840\nSo I'm not holding the Option or\nthe Alt key like I was earlier,\n\n310\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.460\nbecause the scale tool kind of\nhas that functionality built in.\n\n311\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.360\nIf I grab it from the corner it assumes\nyou wanna draw from the center outwards.\n\n312\n00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.980\nSo that's the difference with that tool.\n\n313\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.580\nAgain, I don't use that one very often cuz\nthe thought of having to actually change\n\n314\n00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.730\na tool when I know that it will change for\nme just seems a lot easier.\n\n315\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.450\nBut the Share tool Is one that\nyou might use from time to time.\n\n316\n00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.720\nIt gives you a little bit of perspective.\n\n317\n00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.820\nSo I chose the shear tool.\n\n318\n00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.040\nAnd then as I move it down\nI can see that it changes,\n\n319\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.940\nkinda the sheared angle of that.\n\n320\n00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.680\nIf you hold down the Shift\nkey it will constrain a nice,\n\n321\n00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.450\nI don't wanna say it's 45 degrees.\n\n322\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.080\nThere's that math again,\nbut it keeps it nice.\n\n323\n00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.440\nWe'll get it a nice What are those called,\nthose are trapezoids, right?\n\n324\n00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.890\nI think, so we'll call it that.\n\n325\n00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.760\nBut it keeps it so\n\n326\n00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.650\nthat I don't have to worry about\nkeeping it completely straight.\n\n327\n00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.230\nIf I let go of my Shift key,\nlook what happened,\n\n328\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:23.070\na little bit of movement off the axis\nthere and it can really change.\n\n329\n00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:28.190\nBy holding the Shift key though it\nkeeps it nice and parallel to that.\n\n330\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.390\nSo again the Shear Tool you might do\nthat to just add a little bit of depth.\n\n331\n00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.880\nYou can do this to text as well,\nso it's something that you can do,\n\n332\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.950\nyou can take a text frame and\nsheer the frame itself.\n\n333\n00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.280\nBecause when we're working\nwith that solid tool,\n\n334\n00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.880\nremember we're working with the frame, or\nthe container, as opposed to the content.\n\n335\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.160\nSo I can take all the text in a frame and\n\n336\n00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.520\nangle it, and we'll look at\nthat too when we do more text.\n\n337\n00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.710\nbut, just so you know if that's\na question, put it in your mind,\n\n338\n00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.200\nyes you can do that.\n\n339\n00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.775\nLet's look at stacking order.\n\n340\n00:15:55.775 --> 00:15:58.411\nWhoops.\nI do not wanna open a new document I\n\n341\n00:15:58.411 --> 00:16:02.172\nwanted to jump to page four or\nmaybe it's page five now,\n\n342\n00:16:02.172 --> 00:16:05.550\nno it's page four and\ntalk about stacking order.\n\n343\n00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.420\nSo stacking order is basically how\nthings have been put on a page.\n\n344\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.707\nSo when I put an item on a page,\nand I put another item on a page,\n\n345\n00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:16.690\nit knows that that second\nitem is on top of.\n\n346\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.170\nSo it's be kind of like if you started\non putting things on the table.\n\n347\n00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.580\nYou have your little cutout of a rectangle\nand you put it on a table, and\n\n348\n00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.170\nyou take the green circle and you put\nthat on top of it, and it's on top of it.\n\n349\n00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:31.560\nEven if it's not technically touching it,\nit keeps track of what order it went in.\n\n350\n00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.500\nThere's a lot of reasons\nwhy that's important.\n\n351\n00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.100\nOne is, when I stack them\nall up on top of each other,\n\n352\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.885\none of them obviously blocks\nout the one that's behind.\n\n353\n00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:42.529\nWhen you get into things like doing\nautomation, doing automatic captions,\n\n354\n00:16:42.529 --> 00:16:45.179\nand things like that,\nit knows what order you put it in.\n\n355\n00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:47.387\nAnd then that's how it's going\nto automatically number it.\n\n356\n00:16:47.387 --> 00:16:48.620\nIt's the only way it knows.\n\n357\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.350\nIt doesn't know what you're thinking,\nso it says, hey,\n\n358\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.310\nthis is the order she put them in,\nthis must be the order that they go in.\n\n359\n00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.120\nSo always be aware of that,\nbut you can change it.\n\n360\n00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.980\nSo in this case, like I said,\nI put the rectangle,\n\n361\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.480\nthen I put the circle,\nthen I put the star.\n\n362\n00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.240\nAnd then I squished them together, so\nyou could see what order they went in.\n\n363\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.830\nYou can see which one's on top.\n\n364\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.410\nBut the cool thing is, I can always send\none to the back, or send it back behind.\n\n365\n00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.310\nSo I'm gonna take this star,\nuse the selection tool,\n\n366\n00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.600\na lot of times you can actually do stuff\neven if another tool is selected, but\n\n367\n00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.329\nsometimes you get unexpected result.\n\n368\n00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.850\nSo, always make sure you go\nback to your selection tool,\n\n369\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.390\nand in this case I am using the selection\ntool, because I am working with the frame.\n\n370\n00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.600\nNow the content of that frame\nis going to go with it, so\n\n371\n00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.950\neven when we're working with frames,\nand manipulating frames, the content\n\n372\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.920\nobviously moves with it, it's not gonna\nget left behind, it is a container.\n\n373\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.530\nSo, we take that item, and\nI'm gonna go under the object menu and\n\n374\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.800\ncome down to arrange.\n\n375\n00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.310\nAnd this is where we choose\nwhat order everything's in.\n\n376\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.420\nNow, I have choices.\n\n377\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.050\nBring the front or bring forward.\n\n378\n00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.490\nSo, bring forward means\nbring the forward one level.\n\n379\n00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.130\nBring the front means all the way to the\nfront, same with the back and backwards.\n\n380\n00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.630\nNow, I only have backwards show them,\nbecause it is the front most object.\n\n381\n00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.220\nSo I can go ahead and\nsend that to the back.\n\n382\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.500\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna send this to back and\n\n383\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.670\nI'm gonna put it back behind, in fact, I'm\ngonna shorten this up a little bit here.\n\n384\n00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.510\nShorten that guy up, so\nthat I don't actually see him.\n\n385\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.570\nI'm using my arrow keys to just\nsort of manipulate where he sits.\n\n386\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.530\nNow I know he's back there,\nbut nobody else knows,\n\n387\n00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.480\nso he is actually Actually,\nfirst in the stacking order now.\n\n388\n00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.090\nSo, it starts from the back of the page or\nwhatever's on the bottom.\n\n389\n00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.820\nThat's one and brings forward.\n\n390\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.270\nNow, they're not actually numbered.\n\n391\n00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.730\nI don't have three items to\nkeep track of it in this case,\n\n392\n00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.900\nbut I know that I want to get\nback behind and find that star.\n\n393\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.250\nBecause I realise I don't\nlike the color of that star.\n\n394\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.520\nOr maybe, I'm actually gonna undo that.\n\n395\n00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.050\nJust a little bit.\n\n396\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.820\nI'm doing undoing a bunch of times\nuntil I see enough of the star,\n\n397\n00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.670\nbecause what I wanna do is actually\nsee part of it so that I can keep.\n\n398\n00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.720\nMaybe this is what the design\nneeds to look like.\n\n399\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.270\nI just need that sticking out.\n\n400\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.990\nBut I want to get to\nsomething back behind it.\n\n401\n00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.890\nOr I know I want to change it, but\nI'm not ready to bring it forward yet.\n\n402\n00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.350\nSo what I want to do is be able to get\nto an item, and if I can't get to it by\n\n403\n00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.810\nclicking on it, so obviously here when I\nclick here I try to click on this green\n\n404\n00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.710\none, and it's not clicking because I\nalready have the other one selected.\n\n405\n00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.040\nI just need to find a place where\nthe green is the one that's in front that\n\n406\n00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.580\nI can click.\n\n407\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.170\nAnd I can still grab that star.\n\n408\n00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.930\nLet's move it so we can't, let's go\nahead and hide it back behind there.\n\n409\n00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.090\nAnd we'll close that up so we don't see\nany of it, and I need to get back to it.\n\n410\n00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.500\nIf I click on this item all I keep\nclicking on is that rectangle.\n\n411\n00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.210\nBut I can drill down through the stacking\norder by hitting the command key or\n\n412\n00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.970\nthe control key on a PC and\nwhen I do that, and actually,\n\n413\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.110\nlet's put this guy up front too.\n\n414\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.890\nI want to put them all here,\n\n415\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.140\nbecause now I have to drill\ndown through a couple things.\n\n416\n00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.229\nSo I'm gonna select first that first item,\nthat green circle.\n\n417\n00:19:32.229 --> 00:19:33.411\nI clicked on it, that's what happened.\n\n418\n00:19:33.411 --> 00:19:36.970\nIf I keep clicking, that's all it does\nis keep clicking that green circle.\n\n419\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.010\nI want to click the rectangle behind it.\n\n420\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:41.000\nNow granted in this case I\ncould just go off to the side.\n\n421\n00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.060\nBut let's for clarity sake we're\njust gonna keep drilling through.\n\n422\n00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.510\nI'm gonna hold down the command key or\nthe control key and click again.\n\n423\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.200\nNow it grabs the next thing down In the\nstacking order, which is that rectangle.\n\n424\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.240\nIn a command or control click one more\ntime, and now I've got a square selected.\n\n425\n00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.280\nYou can see that.\n\n426\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.370\nI can tell it's the star, because I can\nlook over here in my color palette, and\n\n427\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.110\nit's a different color and\n\n428\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.850\nso I can see that that's that\nyellow gold that's over there.\n\n429\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.960\nSo I can drill down.\n\n430\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.350\nNow I can do stuff like I knew it was\nback there, I hid it back there or\n\n431\n00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.029\nforgot it was back.\n\n432\n00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:11.370\nAnd I'm like,\nthere is something else back there.\n\n433\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.680\nI can now move my arrow keys, or\n\n434\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.770\nif I am careful I can grab\non this item and move it.\n\n435\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.590\nBut, you would have to be careful,\nbecause sometimes that's what happens,\n\n436\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.560\nit wants to grab the rectangle instead.\n\n437\n00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.930\nWhat I tend to do is hold on to that or,\ntry and grab really close to a handle.\n\n438\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.660\nOr sometimes if you want you can bring\nit forward and do it that way, but\n\n439\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.560\nthen you have to send it\nback through the right.\n\n440\n00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.800\nAnd if you've got a lot of stuff\nstacked up that's difficult.\n\n441\n00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.710\nThat's what we always used to have to do,\nis bring everything to the front,\n\n442\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.990\nchange it, and\nthen try to remember where we had it.\n\n443\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.740\nAnd that's kinda difficult sometimes, but\n\n444\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.770\nwe can drill down through\nthat stacking order.\n\n445\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.310\nSo just keep in mind as you put things\non a page, they are in a stack order.\n\n446\n00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.930\n>> Erica,\nit looks like if you're new to this, and\n\n447\n00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:56.200\nyou're not paying attention to what that\ncursor looks like and even more important\n\n448\n00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.000\nwhat object you're selecting,\nyou could be be in some trouble.\n\n449\n00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.390\nSo would you say definitely pay\nattention to the cursor and\n\n450\n00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.790\ndefinitely pay attention\nto what you're selecting?\n\n451\n00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.260\nAbsolutely, and that's kind of\nwhy I like to use the arrow key,\n\n452\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.590\nbecause once I select it\n>> If I grab it and move it, and\n\n453\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.510\nI just move that,\nsay that rectangle like I did and\n\n454\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.790\nit was exactly where I needed it,\nand maybe I didn't have guides or\n\n455\n00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.070\nI didn't have it locked down,\nI'm going to be pretty mad.\n\n456\n00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.780\nI mean I probably could do undo, but\n\n457\n00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.660\nsometimes you forget where you\nare in the undo backwards backwards.\n\n458\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.530\nSo yea so I always pay attention to that\nI try to, if I've got different colors.\n\n459\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.260\nI try to keep an eye on that as\nwell if they're all the same color,\n\n460\n00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.130\nthat's not going to help you.\n\n461\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.170\nBut yeah, once I select something I\ntend to use the arrow keys to move it,\n\n462\n00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.290\nbecause I just feel like that's a lot\neasier way to keep track of it, and\n\n463\n00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.160\nI can actually go like, I'll hit it\ndown five times or something but\n\n464\n00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.330\nI count, one, two, three, four,\nfive and I'm like that's wrong.\n\n465\n00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.235\nI go backwards five, so\nI can put it back to where it was.\n\n466\n00:21:42.235 --> 00:21:43.965\nEspecially if it's that precise.\n\n467\n00:21:43.965 --> 00:21:45.505\nIf it's not that precise,\nI'm not that worried.\n\n468\n00:21:45.505 --> 00:21:48.835\nBut definitely you have to keep\ntrack of the stacking order.\n\n469\n00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:51.505\nSo that's pretty much how we\nstack everything together, and\n\n470\n00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:52.525\nhow it's put on the page.\n\n471\n00:21:52.525 --> 00:21:56.460\nAnd like I said, keep in mind that there's\nthe stacking order, and then also as we\n\n472\n00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.190\nget into it further and further episodes,\nwe get to also talk about layers.\n\n473\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.380\nSo we kind of see how everything\nis placed on the page.\n\n474\n00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.770\nWe've got the stacking order, and\n\n475\n00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.279\nthen after that we also have layers\nstacked on top of each other.\n\n476\n00:22:06.279 --> 00:22:08.892\nSo again we sort of keeping track at\nleast with layers we have a little bit of\n\n477\n00:22:08.892 --> 00:22:09.407\nmore visual.\n\n478\n00:22:09.407 --> 00:22:13.380\nWith a stacking order all you have is\ntrying to draw down to see those items.\n\n479\n00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.770\nAll right, so the next thing is paths.\n\n480\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.450\nAnd actually we've been creating paths,\nbut\n\n481\n00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.290\nwe've been using these tools to create it,\nbut we're gonna look at some simple paths.\n\n482\n00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.450\nSo, I'm gonna go back out to my desktop,\ngot a file here called Paths.\n\n483\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.630\nAnd when I open that up, I've just got\na couple sample paths here that I drew.\n\n484\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.990\nSo, I've got a simple straight path,\nI've got a curved path,\n\n485\n00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.610\nand then I've got what's\ncalled a closed path.\n\n486\n00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.780\nAnd, we can make paths,\nand that's, like I said,\n\n487\n00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.410\nthat square that we have, the rectangle,\nthe star, all of those are paths.\n\n488\n00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.580\nIt's just that I used a tool\nsaid hey make a star path.\n\n489\n00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.730\nI didn't have to actually\ndraw out the path.\n\n490\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.230\nSo I'm gonna use the pen tool to\ncreate some of these other paths.\n\n491\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.410\nSo I create a new page\nin this same document.\n\n492\n00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.185\nAnd the other thing I can do that I\ndidn't really mention was shapes,\n\n493\n00:22:56.185 --> 00:22:57.260\nbecause I figure it's pretty basic.\n\n494\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.810\nIt's called the line tool.\n\n495\n00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.140\nSo I have just this line tool,\nand I can make a line.\n\n496\n00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.710\nClick and drag out that line.\n\n497\n00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.260\nAnd if I hold down the option or\n\n498\n00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.700\nthe alt key, it draws it from the center,\nso just like when we were drawing frames.\n\n499\n00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.840\nOr if I hold down the shift key as well,\nit constrains it to 45 degree angles, so\n\n500\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.220\nif you're drawing a straight line up and\ndown.\n\n501\n00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.554\nHold down the shift key, so\n\n502\n00:23:16.554 --> 00:23:19.344\nyou can be absolutely certain\nthat it is a straight line.\n\n503\n00:23:19.344 --> 00:23:22.502\nBut all we can do with that is make\na line, when I let go it's a line, and\n\n504\n00:23:22.502 --> 00:23:24.496\nif I wanna continue that line,\nI come here.\n\n505\n00:23:24.496 --> 00:23:26.210\nI think, okay, that looks pretty good.\n\n506\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.610\nBut I'm gonna zoom in on that,\n\n507\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.700\nand we're gonna see that that\nline is not what I expected.\n\n508\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.340\nIt's not a nice mitered edge at all.\n\n509\n00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.260\nIt's two very separate lines.\n\n510\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.480\nAnd when I change one, it's obviously, if\nI move it off, I'm gonna break that line.\n\n511\n00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.940\nSo the line tool is for\nmaking single lines.\n\n512\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.230\nEven when I want a single line though,\na lot of times I'll use the pen tool.\n\n513\n00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.170\nSo, the Pen Tool's over here.\n\n514\n00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.990\nIt's this little pen,\nwhen I click and hold,\n\n515\n00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.730\nI've got some other options\nunderneath it as well.\n\n516\n00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.024\nSo, the pen tool, and I'm not gonna go\ninto a lot of it, because, drawing,\n\n517\n00:23:54.024 --> 00:23:56.104\nif you want to do some\nreally in-depth drawing,\n\n518\n00:23:56.104 --> 00:23:58.414\nyou're gonna go out to\nsomething like Illustrator.\n\n519\n00:23:58.414 --> 00:24:01.297\nAnd, Illustrator has a lot\nmore tools available to you.\n\n520\n00:24:01.297 --> 00:24:02.725\nThe great thing is,\n\n521\n00:24:02.725 --> 00:24:08.032\nInDesign understands the vector objects\nthat you create in Illustrator.\n\n522\n00:24:08.032 --> 00:24:11.950\nSo we understand it all, it's just\nInDesign doesn't have as many tools.\n\n523\n00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.170\nAnd I used to joke that that was so\n\n524\n00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.240\nthat they could keep selling copies of\nIllustrator but now it all comes together.\n\n525\n00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.960\nBut Illustrator is for drawing.\n\n526\n00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.910\nInDesign I'll use for very basic Drawing,\nmaybe I just want a separate frame,\n\n527\n00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.510\nan interesting frame, or\na squiggle or something like that.\n\n528\n00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.310\nI'm not gonna go out to a whole separate\nprogram for that, I'm gonna use InDesign.\n\n529\n00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.330\nSo I'm just gonna talk a little\nbit about the basics of the pen.\n\n530\n00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.848\nSo the pen, I choose the Pen tool,\nand the pen tool,\n\n531\n00:24:33.848 --> 00:24:37.060\nwhen we're working with that,\nit's made up of segments and points.\n\n532\n00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:41.120\nWhen I click I now have a point so I can\nbasically see I've got a point there.\n\n533\n00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.350\nNow I need to do something else because\nit's not a line until I put another\n\n534\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.430\npoint on there.\n\n535\n00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.855\nAgain, going back to math class,\nremember this from math?\n\n536\n00:24:47.855 --> 00:24:50.753\nThat's why I'm not gonna talk about it\nthat much [LAUGH] now because I don't\n\n537\n00:24:50.753 --> 00:24:51.770\nreally need to that much.\n\n538\n00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.370\nBut I'm gonna click again and\n\n539\n00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.330\nI've got two points now and\nthe segment in-between them.\n\n540\n00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.840\nSo it went ahead and\ndrew that segment in-between them.\n\n541\n00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.990\nNow, I do want a nice mitered edge, but\nthe nice thing is when I come back and\n\n542\n00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.308\nI just reverse the order and come over\nhere, now I've got a nice mitered edge.\n\n543\n00:25:05.308 --> 00:25:07.960\nI can come up there and\nsee that it's actually one item.\n\n544\n00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.670\nIf I start manipulating that path later,\nit will continue to update.\n\n545\n00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.310\nSo I can just keep clicking and\nI get all those nice hard points.\n\n546\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.290\nThose are called hard corner points or\njust corner points.\n\n547\n00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.200\nMy other option that I can do,\nand I'm gonna zoom in ever so\n\n548\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.780\nslightly if it will let me and\nstill keep my Pen tool.\n\n549\n00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.580\nVery good, still got my Pen tool selected.\n\n550\n00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.465\nAnd when I click, and\ninstead of just clicking and letting go,\n\n551\n00:25:30.465 --> 00:25:32.600\nI'm clicking and\nholding down the mouse key.\n\n552\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.522\nAnd now I'm dragging out and\nI get this drag handle.\n\n553\n00:25:35.522 --> 00:25:39.830\nAnd it changes the arc and\nthe height of that arc as well.\n\n554\n00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.030\nSo now when I let go, now I have\nthis nice smooth corner point and\n\n555\n00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.280\nthat's what that's called,\na smooth corner point.\n\n556\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.245\nIf I click and drag again,\nit continues that shape for me.\n\n557\n00:25:49.245 --> 00:25:52.679\nI can play with that, do this as well.\n\n558\n00:25:52.679 --> 00:25:55.821\nAnd then at any point I can say but\nnow I want a nice hard corner point,\n\n559\n00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:57.900\nI want a nice V coming up out of here.\n\n560\n00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.181\nWell to do that, I click back on that\nend point, just click on that, and\n\n561\n00:26:01.181 --> 00:26:02.792\nit gets rid of that second handle.\n\n562\n00:26:02.792 --> 00:26:07.640\nSo it says, okay, this handle\nhere is controlling this curve.\n\n563\n00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.080\nBut now I don't have a curve,\nthe next one is gonna be a sharp one so\n\n564\n00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.120\nI I'm gonna hit Sharp.\n\n565\n00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.350\nI'm just doing that so I can kind\nof weasel my way in through there.\n\n566\n00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.220\nAnd I can keep going around and\nnow I'm just scrolling.\n\n567\n00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.980\nIf you had a mouse you\nwould just scroll with it,\n\n568\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.698\nI'm just using my trackpad to scroll.\n\n569\n00:26:20.698 --> 00:26:23.860\nAnd I'm gonna come all the way back\nup to this point where I started.\n\n570\n00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.530\nI'm gonna zoom in so we can see that.\n\n571\n00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.350\nWhen I get close to it I\nget that little circle.\n\n572\n00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.140\nAnd that basically says I'm\ngoing to close that path.\n\n573\n00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.680\nNow if I just wanted an open path,\n\n574\n00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.730\nif I just wanted this crazy set if lines,\nI can just be done.\n\n575\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.450\nI can click on the Direct Selection\ntool or the Escape key to be done.\n\n576\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.230\nSo if I do that,\nthen I'll just have this set of lines.\n\n577\n00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:47.600\nBut by coming back to that first point,\nI'm closing that up and now that's frame.\n\n578\n00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.573\nNow that frame works exactly the same as\nthat rectangle that we have, that circle,\n\n579\n00:26:51.573 --> 00:26:52.156\nthat star.\n\n580\n00:26:52.156 --> 00:26:55.740\nThat's just a crazy, it's not a polygon,\nbut it's a crazy shape.\n\n581\n00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.090\nIt's just that I don't have a tool made\nfor creating just that shape, right?\n\n582\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.830\nSo I can go ahead and make that,\nit's exactly the same.\n\n583\n00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.360\nIt works the same as these items here.\n\n584\n00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.250\nAnd it's just that I created that shape.\n\n585\n00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.401\nIn fact, if I come back to one\nof these shapes that are here,\n\n586\n00:27:10.401 --> 00:27:11.673\nlet's grab this star.\n\n587\n00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:15.139\nAnd I'm actually going to just copy it,\nCmd+ or Ctrl+C.\n\n588\n00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:16.870\nI'm gonna go to my other document.\n\n589\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:21.090\nOn the Mac I am doing Cmd+~ to\nswitch between open documents.\n\n590\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.730\nOr I can use the tabs that are up here.\n\n591\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.050\nAgain, that application frame that\nwe set up way in the beginning,\n\n592\n00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.350\nit gives us these tabs.\n\n593\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.280\nSo it's like tabbed browsing,\nwe get our tabbed items that way.\n\n594\n00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.070\nAnd I'm gonna use my keyboard shortcut to\ncreate a new page, Cmd+ or Ctrl+Shift+P.\n\n595\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.600\nI have a new page and\nI'm gonna Cmd+V to paste.\n\n596\n00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.180\nIf you can't remember all these commands,\nremember they're in the menu.\n\n597\n00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.640\nSo that would be under the Edit menu.\n\n598\n00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.810\nI'm gonna paste that in there and\nI'm gonna zoom in on this guy.\n\n599\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.020\nAnd I wanna actually change\nthe path that's actually there.\n\n600\n00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.080\nI wanna work with some of\nthe points that are on here.\n\n601\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.986\nSo right now all I see is my bounding box\nbut what I wanna do is I wanna get to\n\n602\n00:27:57.986 --> 00:28:02.245\nthe bit that makes up this shape, the\npoints and the segments that are there.\n\n603\n00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:05.640\nSo this is exactly the same\nas if I drew this with a pen.\n\n604\n00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.430\nI'm gonna attempt to draw this star\nwith a pen, it's not going to be pretty.\n\n605\n00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.532\nI'm gonna hold down my Shift key so\nI get that nice straight line.\n\n606\n00:28:11.532 --> 00:28:13.973\nThen I'm gonna up here,\nI'm not gonna hold down my Shift key,\n\n607\n00:28:13.973 --> 00:28:16.430\nI'm gonna undo that because I\ndon't want it to be straight up.\n\n608\n00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.860\nI'm gonna do that and that, and\nwe're gonna draw over here,\n\n609\n00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.830\nlook how beautiful my star is looking.\n\n610\n00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.320\nSo I can draw that star.\n\n611\n00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.730\nIt's not pretty, and it's not even, but\n\n612\n00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:30.070\nI have a star just exactly the same,\nbut I used the Pen tool to do it.\n\n613\n00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.660\nWell, I'm gonna start with something\na little more perfect, but\n\n614\n00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.970\nmaybe I want to change something,\n\n615\n00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.150\nmaybe I want this to be rounded,\nonly the one corner to be rounded.\n\n616\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:41.420\nI can do that, so what I need to do\nis choose the Direct Selection tool.\n\n617\n00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.920\nSo the Direct Selection tool we use\nto manipulate content of a frame.\n\n618\n00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.150\nSo whether that's a picture or,\nin this case,\n\n619\n00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.948\nthe content of the frame is what makes up\nthe frame, the points and the segments.\n\n620\n00:28:51.948 --> 00:28:54.545\nSo I wanna choose that and\nnow when I do that,\n\n621\n00:28:54.545 --> 00:28:58.140\nif I zoom in, you can see the points and\nthe segments that are there.\n\n622\n00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:03.010\nSo I'm actually going to zoom back out,\nI'm gonna grab this and I can move it.\n\n623\n00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:08.040\nWhoops, sometimes if it's\nthose solid blue dots,\n\n624\n00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.120\nyou wanna make sure that they're hollow\nand so it's really an awkward thing.\n\n625\n00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.670\nSometimes change to\nthe Direct Selection tool,\n\n626\n00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.860\nclick off of it,\nnow just click right on that point.\n\n627\n00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.470\nFor whatever reason, sometimes it just\nwants to grab it and move it, but\n\n628\n00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.420\nwhat I really wanted was to be\nable to grab just that segment.\n\n629\n00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.060\nIt's a tricky thing and sometimes\nyou find yourself clicking off and\n\n630\n00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.780\nclicking off just to get to what you need.\n\n631\n00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.570\nBut I can change that,\n\n632\n00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.530\nI'm just gonna drag this out here and\nmake something crazy like that.\n\n633\n00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.350\nNow I've got a little rocket ship going,\nright.\n\n634\n00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:39.410\nSo I can change the actual points and\nsegments that\n\n635\n00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.240\nmake up this path that we created with the\ntools, just that tool made it easy to do.\n\n636\n00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.340\nCouple of the other items that are under\nthe Pen tool when we're manipulating,\n\n637\n00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.210\nis the Add Anchor Point and\nDelete Anchor Point tool.\n\n638\n00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.940\nSo if I decide I needed some more\nanchor points, I could do that as well.\n\n639\n00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.420\nSo by doing the plus, when I get close\nI can see the little plus that shows up\n\n640\n00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.970\non my cursor and\nI can add extra points along the way.\n\n641\n00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:06.010\nSo if I click on, let's actually select\nthis with the Direct Selection tool,\n\n642\n00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.200\nhere's one of those tricky things.\n\n643\n00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.680\nI've got it selected,\ngo back to the Add Anchor Point tool and\n\n644\n00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.840\nclick on a line, there we go.\n\n645\n00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.190\nAnd I've just added some points to that.\n\n646\n00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.805\nSo now I have even more points\nI can grab and pull and\n\n647\n00:30:18.805 --> 00:30:21.936\nput little spikeys on the star or\nwhatever it is I need to do.\n\n648\n00:30:21.936 --> 00:30:24.825\nI can also delete points\nif there are too many.\n\n649\n00:30:24.825 --> 00:30:27.480\nMaybe I don't like this one here,\nI can just delete that and\n\n650\n00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.480\nit automatically gets rid\nof that line that's there.\n\n651\n00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.880\nNow InDesign's smart enough,\nif I have just the Pen tool,\n\n652\n00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.756\nit knows that if I'm near a point,\nas I roll over an existing point,\n\n653\n00:30:37.756 --> 00:30:40.488\nit will say do you wanna\ndelete that point?\n\n654\n00:30:40.488 --> 00:30:41.645\nYes I do.\n\n655\n00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:45.690\nIf I roll over a segment it\nsays do you wanna add a point?\n\n656\n00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.770\nSo I don't even need to\nswitch to that Add and\n\n657\n00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.760\nDelete Anchor Point tool,\nit's smart enough to know that.\n\n658\n00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.980\nHowever, if you've got lots of points\ntogether and you're trying to delete some\n\n659\n00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.290\nand add some, it can get confused\nif you're not super accurate so\n\n660\n00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.510\nI tend to switch back and forth.\n\n661\n00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:03.240\nAnd the last tool that's on here is\nthe Convert Direction Point tool.\n\n662\n00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.840\nAnd this basically says,\nyou have a hard corner point and\n\n663\n00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.775\nyou want it to be a smooth curve?\n\n664\n00:31:07.775 --> 00:31:08.853\nYou can do that.\n\n665\n00:31:08.853 --> 00:31:10.155\nOr if you've got a smooth curve,\n\n666\n00:31:10.155 --> 00:31:13.105\nwe'll have to go back to the page that\nhas some smooth curves, here we go.\n\n667\n00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:15.935\nI'm gonna select this one with\nthe Direct Selection tool,\n\n668\n00:31:15.935 --> 00:31:18.765\ngo back to the Convert Anchor Point.\n\n669\n00:31:18.765 --> 00:31:20.860\nand this convert,\nwith this nice smooth curve that's here,\n\n670\n00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.430\nI'm gonna click on it once and\nit makes that hard corner point.\n\n671\n00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.550\nOr I can take a hard corner point,\n\n672\n00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.700\nwhich we just created,\nand click and drag it out.\n\n673\n00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.300\nSometimes you drag it the wrong way and\nyou'll get this nice twist in your line.\n\n674\n00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.710\nMake sure you drag the right way.\n\n675\n00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:36.350\nBut again, I can select that and\nnow I can grab these handles as well\n\n676\n00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:40.570\nwith the Drect Selection tool and\nI can change those individually.\n\n677\n00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.848\nI can also hold down the Option or the Alt\nkey and just grab one of the handles.\n\n678\n00:31:44.848 --> 00:31:48.414\nRight, so I can change it that way,\nget it back to that corner point and\n\n679\n00:31:48.414 --> 00:31:50.390\njust manipulate it that way.\n\n680\n00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:53.560\nThere's some websites on line about, there\nused to be one called Zen of the Pen and\n\n681\n00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.220\nI think he'since changed.\n\n682\n00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.575\nBut if you do a Google search\non Zen of the Pen you'll find,\n\n683\n00:31:57.575 --> 00:31:59.278\nI think it's switched over to a blog now.\n\n684\n00:31:59.278 --> 00:32:01.525\nBut he has got some great tips for\ndrawing and\n\n685\n00:32:01.525 --> 00:32:03.602\na lot of time he shows it in Illustrator.\n\n686\n00:32:03.602 --> 00:32:07.111\nBut if it's just pen stuff,\nit works just as well in InDesign.\n\n687\n00:32:07.111 --> 00:32:10.575\nSo it's the same sort of stuff, it still\nunderstands, it's still just vector,\n\n688\n00:32:10.575 --> 00:32:13.461\nit's still math, it's still figuring\nout how it needs to draw it.\n\n689\n00:32:13.461 --> 00:32:15.472\nIt's just that you don't have\nas many tools to work with, but\n\n690\n00:32:15.472 --> 00:32:16.487\nyou've got some great tools.\n\n691\n00:32:16.487 --> 00:32:20.661\nFor instance, if I were wanting to make\na frame, maybe to put some text in or\n\n692\n00:32:20.661 --> 00:32:22.120\nwhatever.\n\n693\n00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.340\nI might just come in here and say,\nI just want this frame right here and\n\n694\n00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.670\nthat's my frame.\n\n695\n00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.160\nI don't want it to be a closed box, even\nthough it is and it sees it as that, but\n\n696\n00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.320\nit only drew the frame on the outside.\n\n697\n00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.280\nNow I can either fill that with color or\ntext or\n\n698\n00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.560\nwhatever, we'll add to\nthat as we go along.\n\n699\n00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.801\nBut I can make easy paths that way and\nI can do things like I just want a nice\n\n700\n00:32:41.801 --> 00:32:45.225\nlittle squiggle,\nI'm going to hold down the Shift key.\n\n701\n00:32:45.225 --> 00:32:47.950\nAnd hold down the Shift key and\nhere's where guides might come in handy.\n\n702\n00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.561\nPut a guide across there so you know\nyou're always clicking in the same spot.\n\n703\n00:32:50.561 --> 00:32:52.710\nBut I can come in here and\nmake some waves.\n\n704\n00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.590\nAnd i would make sure that each\none is exactly the same height.\n\n705\n00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.460\nSmart guides help a little bit but\nthe spacing isn't great.\n\n706\n00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.060\nBut I can come in here and make that nice\nlittle squiggle that's there as well.\n\n707\n00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.360\nSo sometimes you just\nneed a little element and\n\n708\n00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.060\nyou don't wanna go out to something\nlike Illustrator to get that done.\n\n709\n00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.450\nUse the Pen tool inside InDesign.\n\n710\n00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.942\n>> That's very great, in fact there's been\ntimes when I have to draw an analogue wave\n\n711\n00:33:12.942 --> 00:33:14.950\nand I can't tell you how many\ntimes I've had to erase it.\n\n712\n00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:16.984\nCuz I can't draw a squiggly line,\nlet alone a straight line.\n\n713\n00:33:16.984 --> 00:33:17.987\n>> Exactly.\n[LAUGH]\n\n714\n00:33:17.987 --> 00:33:19.356\n>> [LAUGH] All great information there,\n\n715\n00:33:19.356 --> 00:33:22.191\nErica, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n716\n00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:22.929\nBut before we do,\n\n717\n00:33:22.929 --> 00:33:25.782\ndo you have any additional words\nyou'd like to throw into this one?\n\n718\n00:33:25.782 --> 00:33:28.400\n>> Nope, just know that you've got\nthe tools that you need to InDesign for\n\n719\n00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.062\na lot of this stuff that you need to do.\n\n720\n00:33:30.062 --> 00:33:32.076\n>> Well, very good and thank you for\njoining us in the studios and\n\n721\n00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:33.640\nthank you to the viewer for\nwatching out there.\n\n722\n00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.526\nSigning out for the ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n723\n00:33:36.526 --> 00:33:37.438\n>> And I'm Erica Gamet.\n\n724\n00:33:37.438 --> 00:33:39.453\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n725\n00:33:39.453 --> 00:33:48.120\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:18.291\nI'm your host West Brian and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n4\n00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:20.481\nSeries in the Abode Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:24.270\nMore specifically,\nwe're focusing more on end design and\n\n6\n00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.630\njoining me back in the studios\ntoday is Erica Gambit.\n\n7\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.520\nErica how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.530\n>> I'm doing great\n>> All right, very good.\n\n9\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.810\nSo, we been talking about\nmany different topics now,\n\n10\n00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.620\nwhats the next thing we\nare going to be learning about?\n\n11\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.130\n>> We're going to start\nplacing stuff into InDesign.\n\n12\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.880\nSo up until this point we've been creating\nthings using the tools that are built in,\n\n13\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.910\nwe've been looking at the environment,\nstarting to put a little structure to it,\n\n14\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.792\nand then we started to\nbuild some simple shapes.\n\n15\n00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:49.990\nWe're gonna actually bring in stuff from\nother places, because that's what InDesign\n\n16\n00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.650\nis for, really, it's for\ntaking all these assets From everywhere,\n\n17\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.100\nwhether it's a type that we're putting in\nInDesign, bringing photos from Photoshop,\n\n18\n00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.680\nwe're bringing in vector\ngraphics from Illustrator and\n\n19\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.940\nwe're gonna put them all\ntogether in one place.\n\n20\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.370\nIt's kinda like the aggregator.\n\n21\n00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.500\nIt's where we put everything together for\noutput.\n\n22\n00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.150\nWhether that's a PDF or print or whatever.\n\n23\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.640\nBut we need to start putting\nsome stuff in here, and\n\n24\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.120\nwe need to bring those\nin from other places.\n\n25\n00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.370\nSo, we're gonna place some assets and\nI'm gonna call the assets because it\n\n26\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.390\ncould be graphics, it could be PDFs,\nit could be all sorts of things.\n\n27\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.860\nSo, we'll call that assets.\n\n28\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.540\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and jump into\nInDesign and I'm gonna double click on\n\n29\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.800\nthis file that I have here called placing\nand it's a big blank file because that's\n\n30\n00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.220\nexactly what you're gonna be staring\nat when you start working, right?\n\n31\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.880\nWe're gonna put some things like some\nguides, I'm gonna hit my W key and bring\n\n32\n00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.120\nin those guides and I actually have some\nfiles here, I'm sorry, some elements here,\n\n33\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.840\nI've got some frames that are graphics\nframes, I know they're graphics frames\n\n34\n00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.040\nbecause they have xs in the middle of them\nand I'm gonna place some file in there.\n\n35\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.370\nI am gonna add an extra page\nthat is completely blank,\n\n36\n00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.350\nwe're gonna come back to this page.\n\n37\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.140\nSo I'm just gonna do Command+Shift+P or\nCtrl+Shift+P on a PC.\n\n38\n00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.400\nTo add a new page.\n\n39\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.460\nSo we're gonna add a new blank page.\n\n40\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.780\nThe only thing it has on it are guides.\n\n41\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.550\nBut I'm gonna place some objects.\n\n42\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.500\nSo when you place something in InDesign,\nwhether it's a PDF or an Illustrator\n\n43\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.690\nfile or a Photoshop file or a tif or\nan eps or jpg or whatever we have,\n\n44\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500\nwe can put that in using the same exact\ncommand, and that is the place command.\n\n45\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.540\nIt's Cmd or Ctrl+D or,\nI'm gonna go back and\n\n46\n00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.030\nshow you what the met word is in the menu.\n\n47\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.250\nIt's file and then place.\n\n48\n00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.300\nSo, Cmd or Ctrl+D.\n\n49\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.550\nSo, no matter what it is we're placing,\nwe don't have to worry about\n\n50\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.640\nremembering what is it we're placing and\nchoosing from a menu.\n\n51\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.360\nWe're just gonna place it.\n\n52\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.820\nAnd design's smart enough, it says,\nhey I need to place something.\n\n53\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.470\nAnd I mentioned in earlier episode that\nwhen we place stuff or create stuff,\n\n54\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.900\nInDesign's smart enough to create a frame\nbecause everything lives in a frame.\n\n55\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.430\nAnd if you haven't created a frame,\nthen it creates one for you on the fly.\n\n56\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.710\nSo in this case I don't have\na frame on this page at all,\n\n57\n00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.060\nwe're gonna go back to that first page\nthat had all those graphics frames there\n\n58\n00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.080\nand we'll put things into those frames.\n\n59\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.040\nBut in this case maybe I don't even know,\nI don't know what size frame I need, or\n\n60\n00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.000\nwhat shape frame or\nwhat proportion anyway, obviously\n\n61\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.070\nit's going to be rectangular to start\nwith, but I don't know what size I need.\n\n62\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.750\nI'm going to do that based on\nthe image that I end up with.\n\n63\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.770\nSo I'm just going to go out and\nit's going to say place and\n\n64\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.220\nhere I see everything\nthat's on my computer.\n\n65\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.810\nSo I have things over on the side bar,\nI've got everything here.\n\n66\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.290\nLet's go out to the desktop,\nI'm going to do command or control D,\n\n67\n00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.410\nI know that's just place and in design,\nbut when you are in this dialog box,\n\n68\n00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.390\nnow it's go to Desktop, and\nthat's a system based thing.\n\n69\n00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.270\nSo, we go on here, and I'm just gonna in\nto where I have a bunch of images here.\n\n70\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.240\nI have a folder called graphics and\nphotos, and in there I've got some AI\n\n71\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.720\nfiles, I've got some layer coms, so\njust sort of a nice collection of photos.\n\n72\n00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.260\nAnd graphics that I have\nthat are out of Illustrator.\n\n73\n00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.470\nLet's place something, so I'm gonna drill\ndown until I get to something interesting.\n\n74\n00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.010\nLet's come here.\n\n75\n00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.480\nItaly's always interesting let's\ngrab some pictures from Italy.\n\n76\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.190\nAnd so I'm just gonna grab\none picture to start with.\n\n77\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.250\nWe're gonna look at putting\nmultiple one's at a time.\n\n78\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.040\nBut right now I'm just\ngonna find one that I want,\n\n79\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.390\nI get a nice Preview of it over here.\n\n80\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.430\nIt's a JPEG file.\n\n81\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.200\nAnd I mentioned that you could\nbring in JPEGs, EPS, TIFF.\n\n82\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.760\nYou can do PSDs, PNGs,\nIllustrator files, PDFs.\n\n83\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.030\nI think I mentioned PDFs.\n\n84\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.530\nYou can place all of those in there, and\nit knows what to do with most of those.\n\n85\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.910\nI'm gonna talk about some best\npractices in just a few minutes.\n\n86\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.720\nFor right now, let's take this JPEG.\n\n87\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.950\nThis is something I took on probably\nmy cell phone, I don't remember, or\n\n88\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.090\nmaybe my digital camera.\n\n89\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.200\nBut it's digital.\n\n90\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.360\nAnd it's JPEG.\n\n91\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.940\nSo down here I've got\na couple different options.\n\n92\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.280\nI can show my import options.\n\n93\n00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.960\nI can replace the selected item.\n\n94\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.740\nAnd we can do captions.\n\n95\n00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.510\nWe're not going to worry about\ncaptions at all right now.\n\n96\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.120\nBut replace selected item,\nthat means if I have a frame.\n\n97\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.720\nalready selected on my page.\n\n98\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.410\nAnd I say replace selected item,\nthis image is going to\n\n99\n00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.640\nwedge its way into that frame, and\nwhatever was in that frame before is gone.\n\n100\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.620\nI almost always have that deselected.\n\n101\n00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.250\nI believe it is on by default.\n\n102\n00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.720\nBut I'm one of those people that may\nhave something selected on page 13,\n\n103\n00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.710\nI'm back on page two working and\nI forgot that that frame was selected and\n\n104\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.040\nI'm ready to place it and\nI wonder where it is?\n\n105\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.910\nWhere did it go?\n\n106\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.550\nThat's cuz I just kicked out whatever\nwas in that frame on page 13.\n\n107\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.710\nSo I tend to turn that off.\n\n108\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.300\nAnd, Show Import Options,\nthis is important many times.\n\n109\n00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.770\nWhen I place an image though,\nprobably not important.\n\n110\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.930\nWhat that does,\nit brings up a second dialogue box.\n\n111\n00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.920\nAnd says,\nhere's some options that you have.\n\n112\n00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.030\nDepending on the file type,\nyour options will be different.\n\n113\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.540\nI'm also gonna turn that off right now.\n\n114\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.470\nWe're gonna look at it in a few\nminutes when we do need it.\n\n115\n00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.750\nRight now I have those both turned off.\n\n116\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.050\nAnd I'm just gonna select the one\nthat I need and say open.\n\n117\n00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.850\nAnd when I do that, I now have\nwhat's called a loaded place cursor.\n\n118\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.530\nSo it's or a place gun is what they call\nit sometimes, which sounds like I should\n\n119\n00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.830\nbe out there going pew, pew,\nputting things on the page.\n\n120\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.570\nWe're not gonna do that.\n\n121\n00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.310\nI don't have all the sound effects for\nthat.\n\n122\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.410\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust load up this cursor and say okay,\n\n123\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.290\nI'm ready with this page.\n\n124\n00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.600\nAnd I can see a little thumbnail\nof what that image looks like.\n\n125\n00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.530\nSo I've got several different options now.\n\n126\n00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.130\nI can define where I need to put this.\n\n127\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.000\nAnd I can even scroll through my pages,\nI'm just scrolling Using my track pad.\n\n128\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.110\nI can scroll and it will sit there\nwith that loaded place cursor\n\n129\n00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.880\nuntil I decide where I wanna put it.\n\n130\n00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.440\nSo a couple different options.\n\n131\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.840\nFirst option is this.\n\n132\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840\nJust click.\n\n133\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.080\nClick once.\n\n134\n00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.900\nBoom.\nThat image gets placed on the page.\n\n135\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.130\nAt the size that that graphic is.\n\n136\n00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.690\nNow if you have a graphic that's huge,\n\n137\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.280\nyou've got something that's like\n6400px wide, well it's going to place\n\n138\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.090\nit like that but I can see that there's an\nedge to my paste board, this is the end.\n\n139\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.770\nSo it might just fall off the bottom\nright side of that frame, and\n\n140\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.450\nyou'll never see it again.\n\n141\n00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.680\nAnd trying to size it down\nIs very difficult because\n\n142\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.210\nnormally we would grab the furthest\noutside and shrink it up to fit.\n\n143\n00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.590\nWell, I can't get to that.\n\n144\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.560\nSo I can scroll and scroll and scroll or\nI can just keep sizing it down, moving it,\n\n145\n00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.920\nsizing it down, moving it.\n\n146\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.250\nThat's not very helpful.\n\n147\n00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.240\nI'm gonna do Cmd or Ctrl + Z to undo that.\n\n148\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.540\nSo I get back to having\nthat load in place cursor.\n\n149\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.970\nThere's an easier way to do this and\n\n150\n00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.560\nmake sure that we know\nwhat size it needs to be.\n\n151\n00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.500\nNow it might be something where I have\nsomething with guides already setup,\n\n152\n00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.030\nWe'll do that as well in a minute.\n\n153\n00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.860\nBut right now I'm just gonna kind\nof freeform it and eyeball it.\n\n154\n00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.750\nI said I don't like to do the eyeballing,\nbut again I can do that and\n\n155\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.040\nthen start making changes to it\nafterwards to make it fit nice and neat.\n\n156\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.740\nSo to do that I'm gonna click and\nhold my mouse and start dragging.\n\n157\n00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.020\nNow we can't really see the picture,\nwhich is kind of a pain.\n\n158\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.720\nBut it doesn't matter because\nwhat it's doing is it's keeping\n\n159\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.310\nA proportional frame for\nthat image that's there.\n\n160\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.600\nSo it was a wide picture.\n\n161\n00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.720\nIf I try and\n\n162\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.900\nI'm moving my cursor to the left cuz what\nI was trying to do was force a tall frame.\n\n163\n00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.350\nWell, it's not going to let me do that.\n\n164\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.660\nIt let's me grow it but\nit's also growing it wide.\n\n165\n00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.050\nIt's keeping that same\nproportion that's that's there.\n\n166\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.900\nSo I can size, and let's say I want\nit to be mostly the size of the page.\n\n167\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.530\nAnd when I let go, boom, that frame is\nthere and it fits inside the frame.\n\n168\n00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.390\nNow we're going to look at some\nof the ways that images may or\n\n169\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.670\nmay not fit inside the frame and\nwhat you might see instead.\n\n170\n00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.810\nSo we'll look at that as well.\n\n171\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.055\nBut right now I've got it set up so\nthat when I click and\n\n172\n00:07:49.055 --> 00:07:53.473\ndrag on it, it automatically fills\nthat image to the size of that frame.\n\n173\n00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.517\nI'm going to undo that again.\n\n174\n00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.949\nGet back to that loaded place cursor, and\n\n175\n00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.810\nlet's say that I did\nactually want a tall frame.\n\n176\n00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.650\nWell, I can do that,\neven though it's a wide picture.\n\n177\n00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.570\nIf I click and\n\n178\n00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.160\ndrag, normally when we hold down\nthe shift key it constrains proportions.\n\n179\n00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.580\nWhat it does here is it toggles it.\n\n180\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.040\nIt turns it off, it's unconstrained\nproportions, so hold down the shift key,\n\n181\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.660\nI now can choose whatever\nproportion frame I want.\n\n182\n00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.960\nSo let's do a tall one.\n\n183\n00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.290\nAnd I hold down the Shift key\nuntil I let go of my mouse key,\n\n184\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.470\nsome will go to mask first and the the\nShift key, and it made the frame, but\n\n185\n00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.800\nyou notice the picture\ndoesn't fill that frame.\n\n186\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.450\nAnd that's because I told it\nthe frame needed to be tall, but\n\n187\n00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.570\nI didn't tell it what\nto do with that image.\n\n188\n00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.930\nWe're going to look at\nthat in just a minute.\n\n189\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.940\nWe'll make some adjustments to\nthe image versus the frame.\n\n190\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.250\nRight now we can see, okay,\nwell, I've got my tall frame,\n\n191\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.100\nI'm going to come back to this picture,\nand we'll worry about it later.\n\n192\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.660\nSo, those are my options for getting\nit on the page with the place command.\n\n193\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.210\nThe other thing that I can do is I can\nactually drag items in from the finder or\n\n194\n00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.100\nthe explorer and drop them in.\n\n195\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.910\nNow, if you have this application\nframe on that's kind of this base,\n\n196\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.450\nthis tray that I said that everything\nsits in, you can't see your desktop.\n\n197\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.050\nYou can do things like,\nmove this out of the way, so\n\n198\n00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.260\nyou can see images or and I don't know if\nthere is a way to do this on the PC but\n\n199\n00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.740\non a Mac,\nI like to toggle between applications.\n\n200\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.850\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm just out\non the desktop, let me actually hide in\n\n201\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.040\ndesign so it's a little clear that\nI am actually on the desktop.\n\n202\n00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.830\nAnd I'm going to come in here, and\nwe'll just open up one of my folders.\n\n203\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.830\nWe'll go to where those\nVenice images are sitting.\n\n204\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.480\nLet's come in here to travel, and\nthen we had some Italy stuff, and\n\n205\n00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.110\nthere's some Venice pictures.\n\n206\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.050\nWhat I can do is grab that item and\nstart dragging it.\n\n207\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.130\nAnd then I can use\nthe keyboard shortcut Cmd+Tab,\n\n208\n00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.850\nwhich lets me toggle between applications.\n\n209\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.300\nI'm just hitting tab multiple times.\n\n210\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.610\nIf I hit tab while holding down\nthe command key still, and\n\n211\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.900\ngo back to In Design,\nI've still got that image,\n\n212\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.080\nI'm still holding down that mouse key so\nit's still there.\n\n213\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.940\nAnd now I can bring that in,\nand I can do the same thing.\n\n214\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.220\nClick or click and drag, click shift drag,\nwhatever it is I need to do.\n\n215\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.940\nI'm letting go of the shift key,\nso I have it proportional, and\n\n216\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.090\nwe'll drop that in there.\n\n217\n00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.470\nSo I can do that that way, as well.\n\n218\n00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.550\nSo I can bring that in.\n\n219\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.960\nLet's jump back to the first page.\n\n220\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.610\nI did a command or control J to jump.\n\n221\n00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.860\nWell, let's actually find the one.\n\n222\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.130\nWhere's the one with all the pages?\n\n223\n00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.370\nAnd I'm sorry, all the graphic frames.\n\n224\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:12.870\nThere we go.\n\n225\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.000\nSo this frame, I know or this.\n\n226\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.040\nSet up is set up so\n\n227\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.080\nthat when I put an image in there,\nit automatically is waiting for\n\n228\n00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.740\na graphic to be placed in there, but\nit won't automatically do it for me.\n\n229\n00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.810\nSo what I need to do is either select\nit and tell it to replace that item\n\n230\n00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.740\nwhich is an option that we just turned\noff, I'm going to turn that back on.\n\n231\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.860\nOr I can tell it afterwards, yeah,\nactually, I do want it inside that frame.\n\n232\n00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.070\nSo, we are going to do two different ways.\n\n233\n00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.300\nLet's make this a little bigger so\nwe can see it.\n\n234\n00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.500\nI've got a frame selected.\n\n235\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.970\nNow, it doesn't have to\nbe a graphics frame.\n\n236\n00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.830\nI could tell it it's not a graphics frame.\n\n237\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.180\nSo, I'm actually going to change this one.\n\n238\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.850\nAnd I'm going to say object, and\nI'm going to come down to content.\n\n239\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.205\nAnd by default, it says graphic.\n\n240\n00:10:53.205 --> 00:10:55.850\nBecause when I drew it,\nI used the graphics frame tool and\n\n241\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.820\nput the x in there,\nit says it's ready for that.\n\n242\n00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.110\nI can tell it actually is not.\n\n243\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.630\nLet's make it on the side.\n\n244\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.300\nYou notice I could also\nchange it to text frame.\n\n245\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.060\nWe are not going to do that, but\njust know that option is there.\n\n246\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.290\nSo this says, okay, I'm not going to put\na graphic in here, but the great thing is\n\n247\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:12.730\nonce I tell it, yeah, put a graphic in\nthere, it changes it on the fly for me.\n\n248\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.780\nSo I'm going to have that selected.\n\n249\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.160\nIt doesn't matter which one we select,\nif it's a graphics or not.\n\n250\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.090\nWe're going to go up to the file menu and\nchoose place.\n\n251\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.000\nCome back down.\n\n252\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.480\nYou can see it's one of the things I never\nuse very often in the file menu because I\n\n253\n00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.470\ncan't remember where it is.\n\n254\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.200\nCommand control d.\n\n255\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.550\nI'm going to bring in\na different picture this time.\n\n256\n00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.760\nLet's bring in this guy, and\nI want to say replace selected item.\n\n257\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.820\nAnd when I do that,\nbecause I had that item selected,\n\n258\n00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.740\nit automatically throws that\npicture inside that frame.\n\n259\n00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.670\nSo if you know where it's going to go,\nselect it first, and\n\n260\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.650\nif you've already set it up.\n\n261\n00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.660\nI've already set up the skeleton of\nwhere I want these images to go, or\n\n262\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.550\nI can do the same thing Cmd or\nCtrl+D to place an image.\n\n263\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.010\nLet's grab this guy.\n\n264\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.520\nI'm going to deselect\nReplace Selected Item.\n\n265\n00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.480\nA lot of words select in there,\nsorry about that.\n\n266\n00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.850\nI'm going to deselect that option, and\nso it says nope, I don't want that, and\n\n267\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.840\nI bring it in and I'm like, no,\nactually, I did want it to go in that,\n\n268\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.780\nI forgot to click that,\nor something like that.\n\n269\n00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.080\nThat happens to me all the time,\nor I have it off for my safety, so\n\n270\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.550\nthat I don't actually replace it, but then\nwhen I say I do want to be able to drop\n\n271\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.550\nthis into an existing frame, I can change\nmy mind without changing that setting.\n\n272\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.410\nSo I'm going to zoom in a little so\nwe can actually see the cursor.\n\n273\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.190\nSo right now what the cursor looks like\nwhen you go with the place cursor,\n\n274\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.540\nhopefully you can see it.\n\n275\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.030\nOn the upper left edge of the corner\nof the image that's there, that I have\n\n276\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.200\nselected, next to that little pictogram\nthat's there, it's like a hard corner.\n\n277\n00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.320\nIt just shows the upper left hand corner.\n\n278\n00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.630\nIf I roll over at a selected image,\nor any image,\n\n279\n00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.960\nyou notice a changes to like little\nrounded parenthesis brackets around there.\n\n280\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.200\nSo, hopefully you can see that\nthat's changing it's ever so\n\n281\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.890\nslightly, it says that\nthing that you rolled over?\n\n282\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.280\nThat's where I'm going to put the thing\nthat's in your place cam, and\n\n283\n00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.110\nit doesn't matter if that\nthing is selected or not.\n\n284\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.200\nSo any of them if I say I know I had that\none selected, but I had it turned off for\n\n285\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.690\nsafety because that's where I wanted it.\n\n286\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.840\nI actually wanted it down\nhere in the lower right, so\n\n287\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.690\nwhen I do that, I roll over and\nit says, you want to put it in there?\n\n288\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.298\nLet's do that.\n\n289\n00:12:59.298 --> 00:13:04.060\nI'm going to zoom out, and when I click\non it, then it puts it inside that frame.\n\n290\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.190\nSo the nice thing is I don't even have\nto choose ahead of time which one,\n\n291\n00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.740\nI just know that I can come in here and\nI can load up a graphic.\n\n292\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.670\nI don't know which one it's going to be.\n\n293\n00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.380\nI don't know maybe which one will fit and\nI'm like, that one looks good,\n\n294\n00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.350\nthat's a tall one,\nI should find a tall frame.\n\n295\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.000\nAnd I can just keep rolling\nover until I find what I think,\n\n296\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.010\nI think that will look good there.\n\n297\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.930\nRoll over it and click it, and it\nautomatically puts it inside that frame.\n\n298\n00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.170\nSo we have options how to get\nthings into our InDesign page.\n\n299\n00:13:30.828 --> 00:13:35.360\nWe want to make sure when we place\ngraphics that we place native files.\n\n300\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.910\nSo what that means is if I'm placing, if\nI’m working with the object in Photoshop,\n\n301\n00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.780\nit's a photo or\nwhat we call raster images.\n\n302\n00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.780\nSo hopefully you'll know the difference\nbetween raster and vector.\n\n303\n00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.630\nRaster is pixel based or\nwe got dots when we go to print it,\n\n304\n00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:55.730\nthat's pixel based on screen and\nwhere in the It's photographic usually not\n\n305\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:00.000\nnecessarily, but anything is in Photoshop\nis considered a rasterized graphic,\n\n306\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.890\nif I'm working in Illustrator,\nthat's vector graphics.\n\n307\n00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.660\nNow, each program can handle the other,\nbut\n\n308\n00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:11.530\nbasically Illustrator is a vector drawing\nprogram and Photoshop raster program.\n\n309\n00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.600\nSo when I bring files in,\nif I done them in Photoshop,\n\n310\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.330\nor I want to bring them in,\nin those native formats.\n\n311\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.060\nSo I want to bring in a Photoshop file,\nif I can, or an Illustrator file.\n\n312\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.820\nSo that means a PSD file or an AI file.\n\n313\n00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.980\nBack in the old days, when I started,\nwell, even after I started, but\n\n314\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.880\nwhen I finally got into computers, you had\nto save out as a TIFF file or an APS file.\n\n315\n00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.500\nAnd that's because the page\nlayout programs at the time,\n\n316\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.690\ncouldn't handle all those file formats,\ncouldn't handle all the cool stuff that\n\n317\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.630\nyou can have in a Photoshop file\nlike transparency and layers.\n\n318\n00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:50.110\nSo, if you have a Photoshop file that\nhas 18 layers or hundred layers,\n\n319\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.550\nI probably wouldn't push it to a hundred\nlayers but you know whatever you have.\n\n320\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.370\nIf you have a layer file,\nyou wanna bring in that layered PSD file.\n\n321\n00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:02.140\nAnd there's still people that adhere to\nthat old work flow, where if you had that\n\n322\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.320\nlayered file, we have to flatten\nall the layers in Photoshop and\n\n323\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.460\nsave it out as a .tif or an .eps.\n\n324\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.450\nWe don't do that anymore.\n\n325\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.460\nWe don't want to do that.\n\n326\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:14.260\nBecause they all share, all the Adobe Apps\nshare the same engines underneath.\n\n327\n00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.440\nSo if I bring in this layered\nPhotoshop file into InDesign,\n\n328\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.750\nInDesign has access to all that\ninformation that Photoshop put in there.\n\n329\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.370\nWhen I flatten it and do things in\nPhotoshop, and if you're not working in\n\n330\n00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.150\nPhotoshop, this might be over your\nhead and don't worry about it, but\n\n331\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.710\nthe bottom line is if you have\naccess to the PSD file, use that.\n\n332\n00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.270\nIf someone gives you something that's got\nPSD and an APS and a tif, use the PSD file\n\n333\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.340\nbecause when we go to export it, whether\nit's for print or exporting it to pdf,\n\n334\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.180\nit can access all that cool information\nthat Photoshop put in there.\n\n335\n00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.998\nYes, it makes it slightly bigger.\n\n336\n00:15:47.998 --> 00:15:50.688\nBut the great thing is,\nwhen we're working in InDesign, and\n\n337\n00:15:50.688 --> 00:15:53.690\nwe'll see this in a later episode\nwhen we start talking about links,\n\n338\n00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.452\nit actually isn't putting\nthe entire Photoshop file in here.\n\n339\n00:15:56.452 --> 00:15:58.054\nIt's just referencing it.\n\n340\n00:15:58.054 --> 00:16:00.179\nYour Photoshop file is\nstill your Photoshop file.\n\n341\n00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:03.216\nWhen it goes to export,\nit takes all that information and\n\n342\n00:16:03.216 --> 00:16:04.810\ndoes what it needs to with it.\n\n343\n00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.409\nSo, the only time I say don't worry\nabout it, I placed a bunch of JPEGS,\n\n344\n00:16:08.409 --> 00:16:09.870\nyou might have noticed.\n\n345\n00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.880\nThat's because they were in JPEG format\nwhen I got them from my camera, or\n\n346\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.660\nmy phone or whatever.\n\n347\n00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.100\nThey're in JPEG format, usually.\n\n348\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.410\nSo, if they are, and\nall I'm doing is placing it,\n\n349\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.520\nI'm gonna put it in JPEG format.\n\n350\n00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.910\nThere's no reason for\nme to open it in Photoshop and\n\n351\n00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.950\nchange it to a Photoshop file.\n\n352\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:31.680\nIf I'm going to make changes to that\ngraphic, I will change it because\n\n353\n00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.390\nevery time you save a JPEG file,\nit dumbs it down ever so slightly.\n\n354\n00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.510\nEach time because it says, hey,\nyou don't need that information,\n\n355\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.060\nyou don't need that.\n\n356\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.100\nAnd every time you save it, make\na change and save it, it dumbs it down.\n\n357\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.620\nSo, if I'm gonna make any change to it,\n\n358\n00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.450\nI'm gonna change it to a PSD file, make\nchanges, and keep it in PSD all the way.\n\n359\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:53.140\n>> And would that be safe to say that\na copy of a copy of a copy isn't so\n\n360\n00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.050\nsharp in the end?\n\n361\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.950\n>> Exactly, and it's not that it's copying\nit, it's just that each time you save it,\n\n362\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.310\nit looks at what you do and don't need,\nand it throws out what it thinks.\n\n363\n00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.630\nSo you're letting the computer think.\n\n364\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.310\nThat's a scary thought right there.\n\n365\n00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.180\nAnd you're letting it think,\nwhat do I not need?\n\n366\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.070\nAnd so, if you're making changes,\nsave it to a PSD file.\n\n367\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.740\nIf you're not making any changes, you're\njust gonna grab stock photos, you're gonna\n\n368\n00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.970\ntake it off your phone and you think,\nmy gosh I'm wonderful at this photography\n\n369\n00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.570\nthing, I'm gonna take what's on, and\nthese are just off an iPhone, I think.\n\n370\n00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:21.490\nAnd so, I can't remember when I took them.\n\n371\n00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.510\nBut they just come in, and they look good.\n\n372\n00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.200\nSo, I'm not gonna make any changes to him,\nI'm just gonna flop him in as is,\n\n373\n00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.460\nkeep it in the jpeg.\n\n374\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.368\nSame with the Illustrator.\n\n375\n00:17:28.368 --> 00:17:32.920\nI said InDesign can understand\nthe Illustrator vectors, and it can.\n\n376\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.570\nWhen I'm placing it,\nit's really not getting into the vectors,\n\n377\n00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.692\nit's just taking what the vectors look\nlike and reinterpreting it as well.\n\n378\n00:17:39.692 --> 00:17:43.170\nSo, again, that just goes back to,\nif you're getting images from other people\n\n379\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.808\nand they say what file\nformat would you like,\n\n380\n00:17:44.808 --> 00:17:48.270\nyou say I'd like the Photoshop file or I'd\nlike the Illustrator file, or whatever.\n\n381\n00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.262\nSay the native files, you'll sound cool.\n\n382\n00:17:50.262 --> 00:17:52.850\nAll right, so we can go ahead and\nbring that in that way.\n\n383\n00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:57.140\nWe can also place PDFs, so\nI'm gonna do that as well.\n\n384\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.900\nI'm gonna jump to the next page,\nwhich I think is page, well,\n\n385\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.120\nwe added a page there, so lets jump there.\n\n386\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.010\nThat was my thing telling me you do not\nhave a page five, what are you thinking?\n\n387\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.762\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a page a five, and\n\n388\n00:18:07.762 --> 00:18:09.820\nall I want to do is bring in a PDF.\n\n389\n00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.370\nSo I'm gonna place it in\nthe same exact way, but\n\n390\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.390\nI do wanna make sure I have\nShow Import Options turned on.\n\n391\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.282\nSo when I do Command or\n\n392\n00:18:16.282 --> 00:18:19.600\nCtrl-D, the first thing I'm gonna\nchoose is Show Import Options.\n\n393\n00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.680\nWith a PDF, I need to have that on\nbecause, if I'm bringing in a multi-page\n\n394\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.720\nPDF, I need to tell it what page\nof that PDF I need to bring in.\n\n395\n00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.370\nI often also bring it in if I'm\nimporting an Illustrator file.\n\n396\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.610\nSo we'll look at that,\nsome options that we have with that.\n\n397\n00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.830\nAnd you'll kind of learn after a while,\ndo I need to.\n\n398\n00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.940\nBecause if you turn that on\nin Show Import Options, and\n\n399\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.530\nwe bring in this JPEG, well, I can't even\nchoose anything, everything's grayed out.\n\n400\n00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.390\nSo I just have to tell it OK,\nso I just added an extra step.\n\n401\n00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.560\nAnd I'm gonna bring in some\nmultiple files in a minute.\n\n402\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.990\nImagine if I was bringing in 10 of these\npictures, 10 times I have to tell it\n\n403\n00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.450\nOK when I didn't even get to make any\nchoice, cuz I don't have any choices.\n\n404\n00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.900\nThere's nothing I can really choose.\n\n405\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.130\nSo we wanna turn that off for that.\n\n406\n00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.030\nSo I'm gonna go back, command or\nCtrl-D to place, Show Import Options.\n\n407\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.160\nAnd I am going and to scroll back up\nthrough here, and I'm gonna place a PDF.\n\n408\n00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.637\nJust bring it in as a multi-page PDF.\n\n409\n00:19:10.637 --> 00:19:11.699\nI'm gonna say open.\n\n410\n00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:14.370\nAnd now, I actually have some things\nthat I can choose from, right?\n\n411\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.000\nSo I'm gonna come in here, and\nI'm gonna tell it what page I want.\n\n412\n00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.006\nSo as I scroll through,\nI can see what my page looks like.\n\n413\n00:19:22.006 --> 00:19:25.130\nSo I can I look at that, and\nI can tell it what page.\n\n414\n00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.360\nOr I can do a page range, if I don't\nwant to do just the preview page.\n\n415\n00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.320\nI can do all of my pages,\nor I can choose a range.\n\n416\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.600\nMaybe we only want from page one to\npage six, that's all we're bringing in.\n\n417\n00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.300\nNow, this is something that we'll look\nat with the Illustrator file, but\n\n418\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.450\nwe can tell it how it needs to crop.\n\n419\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:45.310\nSo, right now, everything I have in\nthat PDF is to the size of the page.\n\n420\n00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.580\nIt's not 8.5, 11, but\nlet's pretend that it is.\n\n421\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.880\nThat it's 11 by 8.5, and\nit will bring in, it says media,\n\n422\n00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.510\nthat means the size of the page.\n\n423\n00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.070\nBut when we look at an Illustrator\ndocument in a second,\n\n424\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.000\nwe're going to see that the choice that\nyou make here is kind of important.\n\n425\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.500\nAlso transparent background.\n\n426\n00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.716\nIf you have a PDF that's just text, and\nyou want to lay it on top of something in\n\n427\n00:20:03.716 --> 00:20:06.260\nInDesign, say we've got\nan image in InDesign.\n\n428\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.680\nMaybe a grayed out image or\njust a kinda screened back image,\n\n429\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.980\nlight in the background,\nand we've got some text.\n\n430\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.193\nMaybe some letter that was laid\nout in Word or something, and\n\n431\n00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:16.790\nit was created as a PDF.\n\n432\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.570\nIf I bring that in with\ntransparent background,\n\n433\n00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.230\nnow my letters will set right on\ntop of that image in InDesign.\n\n434\n00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.380\nIf I don't have that selected,\nit will bring it in, and\n\n435\n00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.900\neverything will be white in back,\nso it'll knock everything out.\n\n436\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.520\nSo you'll want that if you want\nthe transparent background.\n\n437\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.900\nThis case, nothing's going to show\nthrough, and it does take up,\n\n438\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.110\nnow we've got transparency.\n\n439\n00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.540\nOnce we say transparency,\nit adds a little complexity to the file.\n\n440\n00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.310\nSo I tend to turn it off unless I need it.\n\n441\n00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.860\nUnless you're the type that forgets that\nit's not on, you might wanna turn it on.\n\n442\n00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.060\nBut if things start slowing down,\nthat might be a culprit.\n\n443\n00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:46.770\nSo I can do that.\n\n444\n00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.940\nI'm not gonna do anything with layers,\nI'm just gonna say OK.\n\n445\n00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.270\nBut now I've told it page one through six.\n\n446\n00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.090\nAnd now it's gonna bring in all that.\n\n447\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.867\nAnd I can see,\nI'm gonna zoom in as well on that.\n\n448\n00:20:55.867 --> 00:20:58.610\nI can see it's a little acrobat symbol,\nand it says plus,\n\n449\n00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.354\nit's got some multiple pages and\nit's ready for me to place.\n\n450\n00:21:01.354 --> 00:21:05.927\nI can place it in the exact same way,\nI can click and I'll place it to size.\n\n451\n00:21:05.927 --> 00:21:11.370\nI can also use my keyboard shortcut to add\na page, and just add pages as I go along.\n\n452\n00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.410\nSo, maybe in this case I\nwanna drag each one out.\n\n453\n00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.920\nI'm gonna just drag it out,\nthen let go, and I'm gonna add a page.\n\n454\n00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.860\nSo you can see, if I had this set up\nto the right size, like I said I don't\n\n455\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.050\nthink it's 11 by 8.5, but if I did,\nI could just keep clicking on each page.\n\n456\n00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.370\nSo, let's say I want each one\njust set up on the corner.\n\n457\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.880\nClick, add a page, click,\nadd a page, until they're all done.\n\n458\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.880\nI'm gonna undo that and just go backwards.\n\n459\n00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.100\nJust going back to where I'm\nonly on eighth page, and\n\n460\n00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.740\nI've got more pages in there.\n\n461\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.400\nIn this preview that I have,\nI can actually\n\n462\n00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.170\nscroll through the different pages and\nsee what page I want to place next.\n\n463\n00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.362\nSo, even though I have multiple pages\nin there, I can skip a page if I want.\n\n464\n00:21:51.362 --> 00:21:53.340\nI'm gonna use the up and down arrow key.\n\n465\n00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.030\nNo, I'm not.\n\n466\n00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.172\nIt's not going to let me do it.\n\n467\n00:21:55.172 --> 00:21:56.540\nAll right.\n\n468\n00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.612\nSo that changed somewhere along the way.\n\n469\n00:21:58.612 --> 00:22:00.860\nI'm gonna show you that you can\ndo that with images as well,\n\n470\n00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.500\nyou can scroll through if you don’t\nhave them loaded in the right order.\n\n471\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.142\nBut with a PDF, it says nope, you said\nyou wanted page one through six, Erika,\n\n472\n00:22:06.142 --> 00:22:07.360\nhere's your page one through six.\n\n473\n00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.400\nIf you want them in different order,\nwe'll have to go back to the import and\n\n474\n00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.720\nimport them individually that way.\n\n475\n00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.460\nSo again, I can just place this as needed.\n\n476\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.570\nI can even Click and drag,\n\n477\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.330\nI can do a bunch of thumbnails down\nhere until they're all placed.\n\n478\n00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.990\nSo, I can have all those individual pages.\n\n479\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.130\nBut again, that's a multiple page PDF.\n\n480\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.060\nLet's go back to the first page,\nor the second page,\n\n481\n00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.610\nwhere did we leave our pictures of Venice?\n\n482\n00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:30.170\nThere we go.\n\n483\n00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.840\nSo, we can actually,\nwhen I bring in multiple files, so\n\n484\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.012\nI'm gonna do place as well.\n\n485\n00:22:36.012 --> 00:22:39.220\nWe're gonna add the same thing,\nwe're gonna add some photos.\n\n486\n00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.580\nWe're gonna stick with Venice here.\n\n487\n00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.240\nApparently this is our book about Venice.\n\n488\n00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.666\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and\ncommand-shift or\n\n489\n00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:47.620\nCtrl-shift on separate items.\n\n490\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.450\nSo I'm gonna bring in\nfour different images.\n\n491\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.572\nAnd I'm gonna say OK.\n\n492\n00:22:50.572 --> 00:22:52.760\nAnd I don't want Show Import Options,\n\n493\n00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.490\notherwise I gotta OK\nthrough four dialog boxes.\n\n494\n00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.060\nLet's not do that.\n\n495\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.580\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd a new page, and I can use my up and\n\n496\n00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.520\ndown arrow keys on images,\nit's totally not letting me do it.\n\n497\n00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.850\nSo I'm gonna say that is a bug or a really\nweird change that they just set up.\n\n498\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.250\nWhat I should be able to do is to scroll\nthrough with my up and down arrow keys and\n\n499\n00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.105\nhave that scroll through and\nsee what the next image is.\n\n500\n00:23:16.105 --> 00:23:17.085\nThat is not working, and\n\n501\n00:23:17.085 --> 00:23:20.235\nthat is not good because this\nis something I use all the time.\n\n502\n00:23:20.235 --> 00:23:23.045\nSo, we'll see if maybe there's\na setting that they added.\n\n503\n00:23:23.045 --> 00:23:25.885\nSomething else they do with these\nlittle updates that are here,\n\n504\n00:23:25.885 --> 00:23:27.005\nthey'll change a setting.\n\n505\n00:23:27.005 --> 00:23:28.821\nWhat was just default behavior, and\n\n506\n00:23:28.821 --> 00:23:32.500\nthere's some reason why they now decided\nthis is now a user defined setting.\n\n507\n00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.290\nSo I'll see if I can find that and\nwe'll do that.\n\n508\n00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.410\nYou might have it, though,\n\n509\n00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.510\nbecause you might not have the brand\nnewest one that just came out.\n\n510\n00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.240\nAnyway, I will bring in all those and\nwe'll just place them in order then.\n\n511\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.745\nBut I have all these separate items,\nand I can see how many are left.\n\n512\n00:23:45.745 --> 00:23:49.603\nHopefully, in that little number you\ncan see that it says two that are left.\n\n513\n00:23:49.603 --> 00:23:51.537\nAnd I can just click and drag as needed.\n\n514\n00:23:51.537 --> 00:23:55.496\nI'm gonna hold down the Shift key and\nmake a really tall one, and there as well.\n\n515\n00:23:55.496 --> 00:23:58.388\nAll right, so I've placed all\nthose images that are there and\n\n516\n00:23:58.388 --> 00:23:59.900\nI have them ready to use.\n\n517\n00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.620\nBut I don't like this one because I've\ngot that wide image in that tall frame.\n\n518\n00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.530\nSo let's actually change that,\nactually no,\n\n519\n00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.610\nwe're gonna do that in a future episode.\n\n520\n00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.002\nI wanna make sure that's there, we wanna\nmake sure that we have them placed.\n\n521\n00:24:13.002 --> 00:24:14.900\nI want to make sure we got everything.\n\n522\n00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.295\nYep.\nI wanna make sure that I mention that when\n\n523\n00:24:17.295 --> 00:24:21.510\nwe're talking about the PhotoShop\nfiles bring in those native files.\n\n524\n00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.710\nMake sure that it's not flattened.\n\n525\n00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.790\nSo one of the things I said is that\nyou have access to all those layers.\n\n526\n00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.230\nDon't flatten your layers.\n\n527\n00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.660\nI think people have this concept\nthat an unflattened file is huge.\n\n528\n00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:37.140\nAnd it is, but it's not as big as if you\nhave that Photoshop file sitting here and\n\n529\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.730\na flattened version that you\nnow have to keep track of.\n\n530\n00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.220\nAnd now when there's changes you gotta\ngo back to the Photoshop file and\n\n531\n00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.810\nreflatten and reimport it.\n\n532\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.570\nJust put your unflattened\nPhotoshop files that are in there.\n\n533\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:53.170\nAnd to do that and then,\nI want to show you going to Illustrator.\n\n534\n00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.260\nI said that it understands vectors,\nInDesign understands vectors.\n\n535\n00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.540\nAnd so instead of placing a document,\nlike we might come in here and\n\n536\n00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.584\nplace an illustrator file.\n\n537\n00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:04.321\nLet's place this logo.\n\n538\n00:25:04.321 --> 00:25:07.858\nThis is just a vector image\nfrom the illustrator.\n\n539\n00:25:07.858 --> 00:25:08.494\nJust our logo.\n\n540\n00:25:08.494 --> 00:25:13.363\nIt's .AI file and i do wanna show\nmy import options, can do that.\n\n541\n00:25:13.363 --> 00:25:16.945\nAnd it shows me that this is what it's\ngoing to bring and this is media so\n\n542\n00:25:16.945 --> 00:25:19.840\nobviously my size that I\nput my that I put my page.\n\n543\n00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.010\nWhen I created my art\nboard in Illustrator,\n\n544\n00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.180\nit's just a little bit\nbigger than the logo.\n\n545\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.270\nBut I might say,\nlet's bring it into the arc.\n\n546\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.050\nYou notice that I cropped it,\nhopefully you can see that.\n\n547\n00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.280\nThat means it's going to bring it in,\n\n548\n00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.500\njust the bounding box that encompasses\nevery piece of art that's on that page.\n\n549\n00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.760\nWhy does that matter?\n\n550\n00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.672\nWell, if you have this logo out on\nan eight and half by 11 art board, and you\n\n551\n00:25:41.672 --> 00:25:45.733\nneeded it to be in that exact spot on an\neight and a half by 11 page in InDesign.\n\n552\n00:25:45.733 --> 00:25:49.989\nYou would say media because then you know\nit's exactly, especially if you have\n\n553\n00:25:49.989 --> 00:25:53.626\nmultiple pages, or even if it was\nPDF you would have the same thing.\n\n554\n00:25:53.626 --> 00:25:57.069\nMaybe on one page you have a logo, the\nnext page you have a full page of text.\n\n555\n00:25:57.069 --> 00:26:01.075\nAnd you want each one to always sit in\nthe same place as we're placing those\n\n556\n00:26:01.075 --> 00:26:02.052\nmultiple pages.\n\n557\n00:26:02.052 --> 00:26:05.580\nIf I have it to art, well this logo is\ngoing to be in the upper left hand corner\n\n558\n00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.970\ninstead of nice and centered on\nthe art board that it came with.\n\n559\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.370\nSo play with those different\nitems that are there.\n\n560\n00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.100\nI can also turn on the transparent\nbackground on this.\n\n561\n00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.290\nIf I place this on top of a colored\nbackground, I will have that white square.\n\n562\n00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.630\nI'm going to say transparent and\n\n563\n00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.630\nthen every place where I had\nnone assigned an illustrator.\n\n564\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.640\nYou can see through in InDesign as well.\n\n565\n00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.580\nSo that's one of the reasons you might\nwant to turn on the Show Preview.\n\n566\n00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.650\nAnd that's placing that logo.\n\n567\n00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.640\nSo actually, let's place it, and then\nI'm gonna drop it on top of this image.\n\n568\n00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.150\nSo you can see that that\ntransparency actually shows through.\n\n569\n00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.100\nI'm gonna go out to Illustrator\nwhere that logo is sitting.\n\n570\n00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.650\nAnd am gonna do something else, instead\nof placing it, so if i place it InDesign.\n\n571\n00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:46.860\nGo back to InDesign I place that.\n\n572\n00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.160\nAnd I wanna move it or resize it,\nobviously I can do that as a group, but\n\n573\n00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.540\nI wanna get into the different\nelements of that file,\n\n574\n00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.880\nlike maybe I don't like that green.\n\n575\n00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.210\nAnd I decide in this brochure\nI don't want it to be green,\n\n576\n00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.670\neven though my logo is normally green.\n\n577\n00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.410\nI want to change that to orange.\n\n578\n00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.130\nSo I'm going to jump out to Illustrator.\n\n579\n00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.710\nAnd I could change it here and make\nanother version of it and change that, but\n\n580\n00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.620\nI think I'm only going to use it once so\nwhy not work with the elements.\n\n581\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.430\nSo I can select everything that's here,\njust do the command or\n\n582\n00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.220\ncontrol A to select all.\n\n583\n00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.700\nAnd then command or\ncontrol C to copy that.\n\n584\n00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.510\nAnd I'm gonna jump out to InDesign.\n\n585\n00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.840\nAnd I'm going to delete\nthe one that's there.\n\n586\n00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.770\nAnd I'm gonna hit paste.\n\n587\n00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.980\nSo I'm gonna paste it inside here.\n\n588\n00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.230\nSo when I do that,\nI get this dotted line around it.\n\n589\n00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.170\nAnd that just shows me that it's a grouped\nbunch of elements that are here.\n\n590\n00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.600\nZoom back out.\n\n591\n00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.290\nAnd if I want to size that, I can,\nI can play around with that and size it.\n\n592\n00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.980\nBut I just scrunched it up, right?\n\n593\n00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.350\nSo I'm gonna talk about sizing\nin just a second as well.\n\n594\n00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.380\nBut when I did that, you notice I've got\nsome weird things with the font here,\n\n595\n00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.840\nthat's just how the font\ntraveled sometimes.\n\n596\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.620\nWhen they come over from Illustrator,\nthey do some weird things.\n\n597\n00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.640\nBut the cool thing is I can use\nmy Direct Selection Tool and\n\n598\n00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.330\nselect the individual items that are here.\n\n599\n00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.020\nFor whatever reason,\nthat split a part, and,\n\n600\n00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.260\nagain, sometimes it's just\nthe way it translates.\n\n601\n00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.640\nIf I select this,\nI can now see that that's green.\n\n602\n00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.920\nI can go and change the colors.\n\n603\n00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.040\nWe haven't done colors yet.\n\n604\n00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.700\nWe're gonna do that in a future episode.\n\n605\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.720\nBut, I can go ahead and\nmake changes to the individual elements.\n\n606\n00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.850\nEach thing I select is its own thing,\ninstead of one particular image.\n\n607\n00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.310\nAnd that's because I copied\nthe vectors out of Illustrator and\n\n608\n00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.740\nI pasted those into InDesign.\n\n609\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.300\nSo I'm able to actually manipulate\nthat and work with that.\n\n610\n00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.810\nNow where that doesn't work is that if\nI decide to change the name from wild.\n\n611\n00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.620\nI drop the E off of it.\n\n612\n00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.870\nThis one is,\nit's kind of own standalone thing.\n\n613\n00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:39.030\nIf I change the logo in Illustrator it\nwill update wherever it lives in other\n\n614\n00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.320\nInDesign files, except this one\nbecause I didn't really place it.\n\n615\n00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.880\nThere's no link back to the original.\n\n616\n00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.530\nI copied it and\nthen I just pasted it inside there.\n\n617\n00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.070\nSo we wanna keep that in mind as well.\n\n618\n00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.088\n>> Erica, one of the things that\nyou showed us earlier that I\n\n619\n00:28:53.088 --> 00:28:53.900\nthought was great.\n\n620\n00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:58.080\nAny time you can do something once and it\nwill happen multiple times, that's great.\n\n621\n00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.430\nIt's when you imported multiple files,\n>> Yes.\n\n622\n00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.300\n>> You uncheck that option and\nyou could just sit there and\n\n623\n00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.343\nplace them as you needed, didn't have\nto go through many parts of the Wizard.\n\n624\n00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:06.256\nNow judging by the time,\n\n625\n00:29:06.256 --> 00:29:09.520\nit does look like we're coming to the end\nof another episode, but before we do,\n\n626\n00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.610\ndo you got any additional words that\nyou'd like to throw into this one?\n\n627\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.290\n>> No, just get ready cuz we're gonna\nstart manipulating these images\n\n628\n00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.660\neven more in the next episode.\n\n629\n00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.270\n>> All right,\nI look forward to seeing you in that, and\n\n630\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.670\nwe look forward to seeing you as well.\n\n631\n00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.270\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n632\n00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.470\n>> And I'm Erica Gamet.\n\n633\n00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.364\n>> And we'll see ya next time.\n\n634\n00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:31.029\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.480\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\nin today's episode we're continuing\n\n4\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.230\nthrough our series on\nAdobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.510\nMore specifically,\nwe're diving into End Design.\n\n6\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.880\nAnd joining me back in\nthe studios today is Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.680\nErica, how are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.830\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.540\n>> All right.\nGreat.\n\n10\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.760\nAnd what are we're going to\nbe focusing in on right now?\n\n11\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.620\nWe're gonna start working with images,and\nmanipulating them a little bit\n\n12\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.735\nmaking them look really good on our page.\n\n13\n00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:40.460\nS,o we're gonna go ahead and take some\nof the ones that we went ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.310\nplaced in there and now were gonna\nmake sure they fit in the frames.\n\n15\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.620\nBecause that's one of the options,\n\n16\n00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.580\none of the issues that we had\nwhen we started placing images.\n\n17\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.680\nSo I'm actually going to start first\nwith some layered images mentioned in\n\n18\n00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.300\nthe previous episode that we can work with\nthe layered Photoshop files or layered\n\n19\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.340\nIllustrator files, or even layered PDFs,\nand we have access to all those layers.\n\n20\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.560\nSo where that comes in handy, is that I\ncan place a layered Photoshop file and\n\n21\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.470\npick and choose which layers I want\nto show right from within InDesign.\n\n22\n00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.170\nSo if I don't know what layers,\nor maybe I've got layers\n\n23\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.020\nin my Photoshop file that I want to\nturn on or off, I wanna bring those in.\n\n24\n00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.890\nAnd actually I'm gonna go ahead and\nlaunch Photoshop while I'm thinking of it\n\n25\n00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.170\nas well, it just dawned on me, we're going\nto actually see what those look like.\n\n26\n00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.880\nSo I am going to go ahead and go to my\napplications, that's where all of my Adobe\n\n27\n00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.740\napplications live, and I'm going to find\nPhotoshop and find the newest version,\n\n28\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.150\nI have a million different versions,\nlet's make sure we have 2015 there, and\n\n29\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.240\nthat will launch in the background\nwhile we are working.\n\n30\n00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.410\nI'm going to go back to InDesign, and\no I have these layered Photoshop files but\n\n31\n00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.960\nI can choose in InDesign Which\nones I want to have showing.\n\n32\n00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.560\nSo that means that if I have something and\nI wanna kinda just do a couple different\n\n33\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.550\nlooks, I can have one image that has\nseveral different layers in Photoshop and\n\n34\n00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.580\nI can pick and\nchoose which ones show in InDesign.\n\n35\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.650\nSo I can have that same file\nplaced three different times\n\n36\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.570\nwith different layers turned on or off.\n\n37\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.220\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo that, I'm gonna do Cmd or\n\n38\n00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.740\nCtrl + D to bring up my place command.\n\n39\n00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.440\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nchose layers and\n\n40\n00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.310\nlayers comps and I;m gonna choose\nthis one, this has layers.\n\n41\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.760\nI just happen to know it has layers,\nwe'll jump into Photoshop in a minute and\n\n42\n00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.620\nlook at that.\n\n43\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.240\nAnd I wanna say show import options,\n\n44\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.600\nthis is the only way we can choose\nthe layers when we're replacing it.\n\n45\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.410\nWe'll see in a minute,\nwe can actually go back later and\n\n46\n00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.750\nfix it if we didn't have that choice.\n\n47\n00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.880\nSo it automatically jumps\nto the layers tab, and\n\n48\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.710\nit says, great,\nwhat layers do you want to show?\n\n49\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.490\nIn this image,\nI happen to have a few different layers,\n\n50\n00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.240\nit looks like I have about four layers,\nlayer zero, I can turn those on and\n\n51\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.640\noff using the visibility icon,\nso the little eyeball icon.\n\n52\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.970\nSo what I'm seeing when I\nbring this in is layer zero.\n\n53\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.430\nAnd the reason that's the only one that's\nturned on, is the last time this image was\n\n54\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.100\nsaved in Photoshop that's the layer that\nwas turned on, just that layer zero.\n\n55\n00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.260\nBut I can turn on and\noff different layers now and\n\n56\n00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.060\nI'm not affecting my\nPhotoshop file at all.\n\n57\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.750\nIt's just how it's displayed, snd again,\n\n58\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.670\nthis goes back to placing\na native Photoshop file.\n\n59\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.100\nI have access to all the information\nthat Photoshop put in that file.\n\n60\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.550\nIn it's preview to all that information.\n\n61\n00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.020\nI can't make changes to\nthe actual layers themselves, but\n\n62\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.570\nI can turn them on and off.\n\n63\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.940\nSo, I'm actually just\ngonna click this one.\n\n64\n00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.020\nThis is black and white.\n\n65\n00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.030\nWhen I do that Let's actually zoom in so\nyou can see that.\n\n66\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.170\nIt actually turns that layer on and\noff, so I've got a black and\n\n67\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.220\nwhite layer on top of it.\n\n68\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.070\nI can also see what else I have here.\n\n69\n00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.380\nI have this layer of populets.\n\n70\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.640\nLook at this gradient fill,\n\n71\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.190\nit's a nice psychedelic little\nthing that gets going there.\n\n72\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.510\nSo again these are just layers\nthat I have in Photoshop.\n\n73\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.700\nI can turn those on and off.\n\n74\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.400\nLet's turn the black and\n\n75\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.980\nwhite one on there, and I have an option\nto keep layer visibility overrides or not.\n\n76\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.330\nAnd what that means is\nif I say layer zero and\n\n77\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.750\nthe black and white layer are turned on,\nif I go into Photoshop and\n\n78\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.070\nmake a change to the document,\nwhen I bring it back in or\n\n79\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.690\nwhen I update that graphic,\nThose layers will still be turned on.\n\n80\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.920\nEven if I turn off or on different layers\nin Photoshop, I'm telling it no, whatever\n\n81\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.760\nI set in InDesign, that's what I want to\nkeep, or I could say use Photoshop layers.\n\n82\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.690\nNow when I do that, it means if I\nmake a change to the layers then\n\n83\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.650\nthe order of what's turned on in Photoshop\nand save it and bring it back in, it will\n\n84\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.090\ngo back to Photoshop and say, which\nlayers do you have turned on and off?\n\n85\n00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.530\nAnd make sure it duplicates\nthat in InDesign.\n\n86\n00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.500\nBut I tend to keep the layer\nof visibility overrides here.\n\n87\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.730\nSo I'm gonna say OK and\nthen I place it and\n\n88\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.550\nnow I've got that particular\nlayer that's there.\n\n89\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.920\nNow if I placed it and didn't like the\nlayers that are there I can go ahead and\n\n90\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.100\nChange that from this particular spot.\n\n91\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.360\nSo I've got the object selected,\nI have to go up under Object, and\n\n92\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.500\ncome down to Object Layer Options.\n\n93\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.750\nWhen I do that, it pretty much looks like\nthe Import dialogue box that we just did.\n\n94\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.040\nSo if you forgot to do that\nwhen you placed it, it's fine.\n\n95\n00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.070\nYou can come back and do it later.\n\n96\n00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.450\nSo I'm gonna turn that Black and\nwhite off.\n\n97\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.010\nI can also turn on a preview.\n\n98\n00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.560\nSo I can see what that looks\nlike when I'm working.\n\n99\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.860\nLet's see what the gradient\nlooks like instead.\n\n100\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.920\nGreat, so I can go ahead and say, okay.\n\n101\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.210\nNow where this comes in handy is I\ncan take this file and I can copy it.\n\n102\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.220\nI can do command or control C to copy it,\nOor I can do option or alt and drag it.\n\n103\n00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.080\nThat's a great way to get\nit A duplicate of it.\n\n104\n00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.010\nAnd a little trick, if you hold down\nthe Shift key, it also moves it kind of in\n\n105\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.650\nthe same it doesn't let me move\nto much to the left or the right.\n\n106\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.380\nI'm actually moving my cursor\nto the left and right and\n\n107\n00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.440\nyou notice that bottom\nimage isn't really moving.\n\n108\n00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.430\nIf I push it really far it will, but\n\n109\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.260\nthe nice thing is I know\nit's exactly lined up.\n\n110\n00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.120\nIf I don't have the Shift key down,\nI can kind of move it off, and\n\n111\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.350\nit's not exactly lined up.\n\n112\n00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.020\nBut holding the Shift key\ndown it keeps it there.\n\n113\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.380\nSo Option or Alt and Shift.\n\n114\n00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.710\nSo I do that and now I have a copy of it.\n\n115\n00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.060\nI can go up under this Object menu,\n\n116\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.070\ncome back down to that Object Layer\noptions, and turn off that layer.\n\n117\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.430\nMaybe I want black and white.\n\n118\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.760\nSo I'll say OK.\n\n119\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.370\nNow I have one image in here and when we\nget into links and looking at that we're\n\n120\n00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.740\ngonna see that again, I didn't actually\nplace the whole image in there,\n\n121\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.280\nit's sort this placeholder that's there.\n\n122\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.760\nThis little screen version of it.\n\n123\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.860\nBut I can place that there and\nI don't have to worry about changing it in\n\n124\n00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.190\nPhotoshop, going back and saving which\nlayers are turned on or off, but I can.\n\n125\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.710\nSo, I can go ahead and.\n\n126\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.150\nHave different versions\nin the same InDesign file\n\n127\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.790\nwith different layer options turned on and\noff.\n\n128\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.150\nThe other thing that we can do with\nthat is something called layer comps.\n\n129\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.620\nNow this is something that\nyou set up in Photoshop.\n\n130\n00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.470\nSo I'm gonna go into Photoshop,\njust jumped up to Photoshop, and\n\n131\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.980\nopen up my files, gonna scroll down til\nI find all the images that are there.\n\n132\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.730\nLet's come here to graphics and\nI have layers and layer comps, and\n\n133\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.090\nthis one has Layer comps setup.\n\n134\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.870\nNow how do I know that?\n\n135\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.080\nBecause I set it up.\n\n136\n00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.810\nSo I'm gonna show you what\nthat is under my layers panel.\n\n137\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.470\nNow I'm sorry we're jumping out to\nPhotoshop, sometimes you have to do that.\n\n138\n00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.530\nI'm gonna come down here, I'm gonna\nlook at my layers and my layer comps.\n\n139\n00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.420\nAnd what layer comps are is that\nI've taken certain layers and\n\n140\n00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.680\nturned them on and off,\njust like I did in InDesign.\n\n141\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.560\nI did that in Photoshop and then I saved\nit, so that I have one comp so that I\n\n142\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.710\ndon't have to remember which layers I\nturned on and off to get a specific look.\n\n143\n00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.440\nSo in this case I can say what is\nthe psych color one look like?\n\n144\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.280\nI turn that on.\n\n145\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.620\nThat's what that looks like, or I've\ngot a psychedelic black and white one.\n\n146\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.720\nIt has that gradient and\nthe black and white applied.\n\n147\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.670\nI have one that's just color bloom,\nso it's basically a black and\n\n148\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.470\nwhite background with\njust the bloom in color.\n\n149\n00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.070\nSo again I just turned layers on and\noff and\n\n150\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.340\nsaid save that as a comp,\nsave that as a comp.\n\n151\n00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.130\nSo I don't have to turn layers on and\noff, how does that help me in InDesign?\n\n152\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.720\nWell I can access those layer\ncomps back in InDesign.\n\n153\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.210\nSo I got InDesign and I'm gonna go ahead\nand place that graphic that we just had.\n\n154\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.870\nThe layer comps one Show import options.\n\n155\n00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.680\nIt's going to look pretty much the same,\nonly now I have an option for laracomps.\n\n156\n00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.940\nIt was grayed out before, if you don't\nhave laracomps it will be grayed out.\n\n157\n00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.180\nSo I can turn layers on and off manually\nif I want, or I can go to these\n\n158\n00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.400\nlayer comps, automatically it wants\nto do the last document state.\n\n159\n00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.680\nThat means when I last\nsaved that Photoshop file,\n\n160\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.550\nthat's what we'll come in looking like.\n\n161\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.590\nNow I didn't save it just\nnow when I was out there so\n\n162\n00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.840\nit looks like it did\nthe last time I saved it.\n\n163\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.830\nBut I say okay let's do that\npsychedelic color one, beautiful.\n\n164\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.360\nNo I don't like that,\nlet's try just the color bloom.\n\n165\n00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.550\nThat's what I wanted.\n\n166\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.510\nSo, by saving that in Photoshop,\n\n167\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.250\nI don't have to worry about\nturning layers on and off here.\n\n168\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.490\nI can just do it ahead of time.\n\n169\n00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.445\nEverything else is exactly the same.\n\n170\n00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:53.069\nI could start from that layer comp and\ngo, and also,\n\n171\n00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:56.182\nI want the gradient fill on top of that,\nfor whatever reason.\n\n172\n00:07:56.182 --> 00:07:58.425\nBut now it changed to custom, of course.\n\n173\n00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:00.327\nLet's put it back to color.\n\n174\n00:08:00.327 --> 00:08:01.173\nAgain, same thing.\n\n175\n00:08:01.173 --> 00:08:02.425\nI could turn layers on and off.\n\n176\n00:08:02.425 --> 00:08:05.890\nI can access that after the fact, so\nyou have a lot of different options.\n\n177\n00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.520\nBy keeping your native files native,\nyou get access to all those layers.\n\n178\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.030\nIf you don't have it in a native file,\nyou make it a JPEG or TIFF,\n\n179\n00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.200\nyou flatten it,\nyou have no access to any of that.\n\n180\n00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.760\nSo, just another reason to keep\nthat in the native file format.\n\n181\n00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.120\nLet's go back to something we\nplaced a little while ago.\n\n182\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.610\nHere's that pesky image.\n\n183\n00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.510\nI'm gonna actually get\nrid of a couple of these.\n\n184\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.080\nThose look good.\n\n185\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.330\nLet's get rid of them.\n\n186\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.270\nSo I'm gonna come in here,\nI'm gonna grab this frame here.\n\n187\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.330\nAnd I am going to zoom\nin a little bit on that.\n\n188\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.380\nAnd we made this tall frame.\n\n189\n00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.500\nAnd then we put a wide picture in it.\n\n190\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.590\nAnd that's what it ended up looking like.\n\n191\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.150\nThat is no good for us because the whole\npoint of making that tall frame\n\n192\n00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.500\nwas to fill it with a tall image.\n\n193\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.140\nI'm going to zoom in a little bit more.\n\n194\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.830\nI just feel like I can't\nget it in zoomed enough.\n\n195\n00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.940\nThere we go.\nWanted be able to see that.\n\n196\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.190\nSo this is the size frame I want.\n\n197\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.940\nMaybe I have a newsletter and\nit's always this tall frame, and\n\n198\n00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.280\nthis time it just happens to be a wide\npicture and we have to make it work.\n\n199\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.620\nThat's just the constraints\nwe're working with.\n\n200\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.350\nSo I'm gonna come in here and I have\na couple different options for that.\n\n201\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.780\nThe first one is, I can manually\nforce it to fit to the frame.\n\n202\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.620\nSo I'm gonna select the frame\nwith the selection tool,\n\n203\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.420\nthe solid tool,\neven though I'm working with content.\n\n204\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.270\nI know I said to use\nthe direct selection tool,\n\n205\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.170\nwe are gonna work with\nthat in a minute as well.\n\n206\n00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.210\nBut what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna select the frame, so\n\n207\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.000\nI have frame selected here, and\nI'm gonna go up under the object menu.\n\n208\n00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.100\nAnd I'm gonna choose fitting.\n\n209\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.090\nAnd from there I have fitting options.\n\n210\n00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.330\nThe top one is what I want to use.\n\n211\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.530\nSo we'll actually do that last.\n\n212\n00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.950\nWe'll look at the other ones first.\n\n213\n00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.500\nI can fit my content proportionally.\n\n214\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.550\nSo when I do that,\nit fits it proportionally,\n\n215\n00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.810\nwhich is exactly what I have.\n\n216\n00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.050\nBecause it made it fit\nentirely within the frame, and\n\n217\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.840\nit kept the picture in\nits original proportions.\n\n218\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.470\nSo that's what we had,\nthat's not what we want.\n\n219\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.170\nGo back to the Object menu, and\n\n220\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.790\nchange the Fitting menu to,\nlet's fit the content to the frame.\n\n221\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.910\nSo when I do that,\nthat's exactly what it did.\n\n222\n00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.820\nSo does that remind\nanybody of Microsoft Word?\n\n223\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.549\nMaybe, or something even older.\n\n224\n00:10:00.549 --> 00:10:02.950\nBut it just basically\nsquished it in there.\n\n225\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.960\nI fit the content to the frame.\n\n226\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.110\nThe content absolutely fits in that\nframe no matter what it had to do,\n\n227\n00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.400\nin this case squish it.\n\n228\n00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.110\nI'm gonna undo that.\n\n229\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.770\nGo back to that same menu,\nwe're gonna keep going back and\n\n230\n00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.380\nwe're gonna look at all the options.\n\n231\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.380\nI can fit the frame to\nthe content if I want, so\n\n232\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.750\nnow the frame fits exactly to the content.\n\n233\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.310\nWell that would have been just the same\nas if we had drawn it out, and\n\n234\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.510\nwhen we placed it, drawn it out and then\nkept it in the nice original proportions.\n\n235\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.790\nSo that took us two steps to get to\nthe same place we could have just gone\n\n236\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.560\nwith one before.\n\n237\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.050\nWe don't want to do that either.\n\n238\n00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:31.780\nGonna undo.\n\n239\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.710\nEach time I'm just gonna undo and\nstep backwards.\n\n240\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.970\nCome back down to the Fitting menu, and\n\n241\n00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.080\nI can choose to fit\nthe content proportionally.\n\n242\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.800\nOops, we already did that one,\nsorry about that.\n\n243\n00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.060\nThat's not the one we want to do.\n\n244\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.940\nI want to come in here and say,\nfill the frame proportionally.\n\n245\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.500\nAnd this is the one that I use a lot.\n\n246\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.120\nIn a minute we're gonna set it so\nit actually is the default, so\n\n247\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.200\nwe don't have to do this every time.\n\n248\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.780\nThis is a theme that you'll see\nthroughout all the episodes.\n\n249\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.500\nWhy are we doing this over and over again?\n\n250\n00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.610\nThere must be a way to change it and\nmake it work for us, and\n\n251\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.340\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n252\n00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.150\nRight now I'm gonna say,\nfill this frame proportionally.\n\n253\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.900\nSo what it's going to do is it's going\nto fill it so that there is no gaps.\n\n254\n00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.280\nSo it fills it to the height and\nthe width, but it cropped it.\n\n255\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.300\nIt cropped it how it sees fit.\n\n256\n00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.450\nSo that may or may not work.\n\n257\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.410\nThat actually doesn't look that bad.\n\n258\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.290\nBut a lot of times, it's not gonna\nlook like you want it to look.\n\n259\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.070\nSo what you have to do is you need\nto be able to move either the frame.\n\n260\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.630\nBut in our scenario we said, nope,\nwe're stuck with this nice frame, so\n\n261\n00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.380\nwe might have to move the image instead.\n\n262\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.585\nSo how do we do that?\n\n263\n00:11:28.585 --> 00:11:30.610\nWe've got a couple of different options.\n\n264\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.310\nFirst one is, we can move the image.\n\n265\n00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.615\nLike I like the way this looks, but\n\n266\n00:11:34.615 --> 00:11:36.738\nmaybe we just want to move it\noff to the left a little bit.\n\n267\n00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.648\nBecause I've got a little bit of this dome\noff to the right that I'd like to include\n\n268\n00:11:39.648 --> 00:11:41.440\na part of that, so\nI just want to shift it.\n\n269\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.860\nSo I can actually see where that\nimage sits and how that's cropped.\n\n270\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.120\nAgain, it's one of those things where\nwe can see it if we tap on it or\n\n271\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.650\nselect it and hold on it for\na second, we can see a nice preview.\n\n272\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.980\nI do know that the newest version has some\nweird issues with the drawing of that.\n\n273\n00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.010\nAnd I'll show you that as well.\n\n274\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.590\nSo yours might look a little differently\nwhen you're working if you don't have\n\n275\n00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.120\nthe newest, newest version.\n\n276\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.010\nOr if they've fixed the bug\nby the time you updated it.\n\n277\n00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.830\nI'm going to assume it's a bug.\n\n278\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:09.500\nSo anyway, when I work with the content,\nI need to use the Direct Selection tool.\n\n279\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.580\nAgain, when we work with the content of a\nframe, the Direct Selection tool is used.\n\n280\n00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.320\nOr the Hollow tool.\n\n281\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.020\nAnd when I do that, I've got a couple\nsteps I have to take with that.\n\n282\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.410\nI'm gonna also show you that InDesign is\nsmart enough to know the difference and\n\n283\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.390\nwe really don't have to do it this way,\nbut sometimes this is the way to do it.\n\n284\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.730\nSo the Direct Selection Tool,\nthe Hollow tool, let's click on that.\n\n285\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.840\nWhen I do that, watch the frame.\n\n286\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.470\nOkay, I've gone back\nto the Selection tool,\n\n287\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.500\nand we've got the grab handles, right?\n\n288\n00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.780\nThat means hey,\nI can change the size of this frame.\n\n289\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.570\nBut what I want to do is I want\nto use the Direct Selection tool.\n\n290\n00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:45.600\nAnd when I do that, now I only\nhave four little handles on there.\n\n291\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.250\nAnd so I come over here and\nI have four handles.\n\n292\n00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.570\nJust ignore those squares,\nthe yellow and blue squares.\n\n293\n00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.030\nWe're not gonna worry about those yet.\n\n294\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.720\nBut the four handles.\n\n295\n00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.540\nAnd that's basically saying you've\ngone to the Direct Selection tool,\n\n296\n00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.040\nyou must want to work with\nthe content of the frame.\n\n297\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.760\nMeaning the points and\nsegments that make up the frame.\n\n298\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.880\nWell, we might want to do that,\nthat's not really what I was hoping to do.\n\n299\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.420\nAnd so if I did that,\nI can come in here and click on that and\n\n300\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.460\nchange the frame itself.\n\n301\n00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.450\nBecause again, this is what we did\nwhen we created a frame before.\n\n302\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.180\nThere wasn't anything in it, but\nyou can manipulate the frame.\n\n303\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.730\nI'm gonna undo that because\nthat's not what I wanted.\n\n304\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.650\nWhat I want to do is\nclick now on the image.\n\n305\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.810\nAnd when I roll over it you notice\nI get this nice like kind of brown\n\n306\n00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.520\noutline that's there,\nand that is the image.\n\n307\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.695\nThat's how big the image and wide.\n\n308\n00:13:28.695 --> 00:13:30.228\nThis is the the part that's showing.\n\n309\n00:13:30.228 --> 00:13:32.660\nI want to click it one more time.\n\n310\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.800\nAnd now when I do it,\nnow I've got this thing selected.\n\n311\n00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.800\nThis is the image.\n\n312\n00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.850\nThis is the full image that's here.\n\n313\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.270\nBut I can't see it yet still.\n\n314\n00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.100\nI need to actually click on it,\ngive it that second to redraw it,\n\n315\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.520\nand then I'll be able to see everything.\n\n316\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.480\nSo when I click and hold on it,\nnow I can see the whole image.\n\n317\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.000\nI can move this image as I need, because\nin this case, we said the frame is set.\n\n318\n00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.130\nNow if I hold down the Shift key,\nthat means I can move it nicely, and\n\n319\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.620\nI don't end up slipping out of the frame\nunless I push it a little too hard.\n\n320\n00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.240\nIf I don't have that Shift, I could\naccidentally move this down a little bit,\n\n321\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.670\nand suddenly there's gonna\nbe some white space.\n\n322\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.110\nEspecially if your frame has a solid color\naround it, it's gonna be very obvious.\n\n323\n00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.474\nSo I tend to, when I'm moving things,\neither to hold down the Shift key, or\n\n324\n00:14:13.474 --> 00:14:14.700\njust use the arrow keys.\n\n325\n00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.350\nJust depends on how far you\nhave to actually work, but\n\n326\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.750\nthe arrow keys work just fine.\n\n327\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.320\nSo I'm just gonna move it out\na little bit and say okay,\n\n328\n00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.060\nI kind of like the width,\nthat is a little bit better, right?\n\n329\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.810\nSo we are stuck with\nthe size of the frame.\n\n330\n00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.700\nAnd then I can go back to\nthe Selection tool and\n\n331\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.600\nselect off of it and\nthen I can work with that.\n\n332\n00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.620\nSo where InDesign changed things\na while back is they added\n\n333\n00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.310\nthis little thing that keeps\npopping up when I roll over it.\n\n334\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.100\nI've got the Selection tool, which\nmeans I'm working with the frame, but\n\n335\n00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.530\nwhen I roll over near the center\nI get this thing, and\n\n336\n00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.940\nit's called the Content Grabber.\n\n337\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.910\nI like to call it the translucent bagel.\n\n338\n00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.310\nI don't remember who came up with that,\nbut it made me laugh so hard and\n\n339\n00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.990\nI remembered it, I never forgot it.\n\n340\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.620\nYou can turn it off if you want.\n\n341\n00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.290\nSome people find it annoying.\n\n342\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:53.860\nI find it great.\n\n343\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.900\nIt means I don't have to go\nto the Direct Selection tool.\n\n344\n00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.330\nI'm using the Selection tool and I'm\nmoving this around, I'm moving the frame.\n\n345\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.410\nAnd when I move the frame\nthe content comes with it.\n\n346\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.630\nI'll show you how to resize the frame and\nleave the content where it is.\n\n347\n00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.740\nBut for the most part, if you're\nmoving the frame you probably want to\n\n348\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.710\nmove everything that's inside it as well.\n\n349\n00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.490\nSo I'm doing that, moving it around.\n\n350\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.390\nAnd then when I roll over that middle,\neven though it doesn't necessarily show\n\n351\n00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.100\nup, I get that hand and it says,\nnow you want to work with the content?\n\n352\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.340\nYes, I do.\nSo I just need to grab it.\n\n353\n00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.960\nAnd now I click and hold and grab it.\n\n354\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.330\nI never changed tools.\n\n355\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:24.970\nIt hasn't changed.\n\n356\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.240\nIt's still the selection tool.\n\n357\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.890\nBut now I can move this and go,\nokay, I think that looks good.\n\n358\n00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.770\nNow I can say, and maybe we should move\nthis off to the left a little bit, yeah.\n\n359\n00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.560\nBut now the image needs to move.\n\n360\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.410\nRoll over towards the middle.\n\n361\n00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.380\nHold the Shift down.\n\n362\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.330\nMove this over.\n\n363\n00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.763\nSo again, I have not had to switch\nthose tools back and forth.\n\n364\n00:15:42.763 --> 00:15:44.219\nSo it just automatically switches.\n\n365\n00:15:44.219 --> 00:15:48.348\nIt's basically switching to the Direct\nSelection tool, but you also get to skip\n\n366\n00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:51.882\nthat step that says Do you wanna\nactually manipulate the frame?\n\n367\n00:15:51.882 --> 00:15:52.648\nNo, I don't.\n\n368\n00:15:52.648 --> 00:15:54.079\nIf you do wanna switch to the frame,\n\n369\n00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:57.510\nthen you have to use the direct\nselection tool to get to those points.\n\n370\n00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.200\nSo that's how we actually\nget that to fit in there.\n\n371\n00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.200\nSo we use the fitting\nthat's there to change it,\n\n372\n00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.380\nand then we use those tools to\nmanipulate it a little bit.\n\n373\n00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.850\nNow, what if I want to change\nthe size of this frame?\n\n374\n00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.610\nI've got, the image looks good,\nI like the The way it is but\n\n375\n00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.640\nI wanna change maybe the size of the\nframe, or I decide okay, maybe am not so\n\n376\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.010\nrestricted on the size of the frame,\nI can grab it and change it just as\n\n377\n00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.110\nwe were doing when there was nothing in\nit, I can grab one on the handles, and\n\n378\n00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.420\nagain if you click and hold Pull for\na second, you get the visual.\n\n379\n00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.740\nThere's actually a preference for\nthat inside the interface.\n\n380\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.430\nYou can go into the preferences interface\nand you can choose whether you want it to\n\n381\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.930\nbe immediate or no preview at all, or\nif you want it to have that little lagged\n\n382\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.510\nTime, and I like the lag time, because\nsome times I just wanna move it quickly.\n\n383\n00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.370\nSo I can click and hold and\ngo okay, now I can see, and\n\n384\n00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.450\nI'm like yeah lt's actually get\nthat little helicopter in there.\n\n385\n00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.980\nThat's cool, so\nI do that and I move it, so\n\n386\n00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.610\nI'm moving the frame or\nI can click in here and move the image.\n\n387\n00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.790\nSo they work independently,\nyou've got one item But it got content, so\n\n388\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.420\nthe content and\nthe frame itself move individually.\n\n389\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.640\nAlright, so let's actually size\nthings now we say okay that's great,\n\n390\n00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.520\nI like the way that image\nsits in the frame, but\n\n391\n00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.340\nthe frame about the whole\nthing to be smaller but\n\n392\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.430\nI like the way it's laid out, I loved\nthe composition, I love the proportions,\n\n393\n00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.340\nlet's make it smaller Well I use\nmy selection tool, the solid tool.\n\n394\n00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.370\nAnd I would come over here and\nI grab the end.\n\n395\n00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:27.370\nI click on it so I get the grab handle and\nI size this down.\n\n396\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.900\nI'm gonna hold the shift key so\nit's proportionate.\n\n397\n00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.340\nI did exactly that.\n\n398\n00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.810\nI sized the frame but not the image.\n\n399\n00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.200\nSo the image is sitting there.\n\n400\n00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.270\nIt's basically like if\nyou had a photograph, and\n\n401\n00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.490\nyou have one of those mats,\nthe mat frame that you put on there,\n\n402\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.690\nand you're going to change the size of the\nmat, to show or hide a little bit more of\n\n403\n00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:47.490\nthe image, but the image itself, the photo\nitself, is set at size So let's undo that.\n\n404\n00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.280\nWe didn't want to do that.\n\n405\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.580\nWe wanted to shrink\nthe whole thing together.\n\n406\n00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.690\nThis takes, I call this one of my\nbring a friend shortcuts cuz I feel\n\n407\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.190\nlike you need three hands to do it.\n\n408\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.090\nYou don't, but sometimes it feels like it.\n\n409\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.000\nso if I wanna size that all down together,\n\n410\n00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.650\nI'm gonna go to the grab handle and\nstart to size it down.\n\n411\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.640\nI'm gonna hold down the command key or\nthe control key and\n\n412\n00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.380\nthat's gonna grab\nthe image with the frame.\n\n413\n00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.970\nIt's gonna lock it together.\n\n414\n00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.570\nI'm also gonna hold the shift key so\nthat it stays proportionate.\n\n415\n00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.780\nI could also, for fun, throw in\nthe option of the Alt key which will,\n\n416\n00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.950\ninstead of scrunching up to the upper\nleft, or whichever direction I drag,\n\n417\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.230\nit will drop from the middle inward.\n\n418\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.410\nI'm gonna leave the option\nAlt key out of it right now.\n\n419\n00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.850\nSo I'm holding on the command and\ncontrol key.\n\n420\n00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.110\nAnd then I'm gonna hold\nthe shift key as well.\n\n421\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.450\nAs I do that and if I click and drag, I\ncan see visually what's happening to that.\n\n422\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.330\nSo my frame and my image are still\nin relation to each other, but\n\n423\n00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.920\nnow I'm sizing it down together.\n\n424\n00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.670\nSo you might spend time going,\nokay let's move this down.\n\n425\n00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.720\nThen actually I would like a wider frame,\nso let's do that.\n\n426\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.370\nYou realize, oops I ran out of image so\nmaybe I need to make just the image bigger\n\n427\n00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.760\nnow we like the frame but,\nthe image needs to be bigger.\n\n428\n00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.980\nI clicked on the little\ntranslucent bagel and\n\n429\n00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.550\nthat means that I have the image selected.\n\n430\n00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:59.280\nI can size this just like I did the frame\nif I grab one of these handles,\n\n431\n00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.690\nholding the Shift key to keep it in\nproportion, and waiting a second, again,\n\n432\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.790\nso I visually see it.\n\n433\n00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.300\nI'll see if it will work come on.\n\n434\n00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.350\nThis is the one that's having\na little trouble drawing.\n\n435\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.640\nThere we go.\nAnd I can bring it out and\n\n436\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.010\nmake sure that it fills the frame nicely.\n\n437\n00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.210\nAnd then I decide I like that.\n\n438\n00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.670\nAnd then maybe we move it off\nto the left a little bit.\n\n439\n00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.490\nSo, again, it's a little back and forth.\n\n440\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.400\nIt becomes more and\nmore natural the more you do it.\n\n441\n00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.240\nBut just keep in mind that I\nnever had to change tools at all.\n\n442\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.740\nThe whole time I've been sitting\nhere with the selection tool.\n\n443\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.940\nStarted with the Frame, when I click\non this it automatically changes.\n\n444\n00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.470\nI can do whatever I need to, resize it,\nmove it, move it down a little.\n\n445\n00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.180\nI can do it with the option key\nto do it from the center, inward,\n\n446\n00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.080\nwhoops, that's a little bit not good.\n\n447\n00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.190\nWe have to make that a little bit taller.\n\n448\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.910\nAnd then, I'll click on this again,\n\n449\n00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.635\nsometimes you need to click\noff of it just to activate it.\n\n450\n00:19:44.635 --> 00:19:47.300\n[INAUDIBLE] In, and then maybe\nI'll hold down the Command key and\n\n451\n00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.080\nthe Shift key I do it that way.\n\n452\n00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.440\nSo, it becomes natural.\n\n453\n00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.850\nIt does take a little bit of getting\nused to, especially with all the extra\n\n454\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.380\nmodifier keys that you have to\nhit at that same exact time.\n\n455\n00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.240\nSo that's how we move things in a frame\nand independently of the frame as well.\n\n456\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.970\nSo, just get used to it.\n\n457\n00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.570\nPlay with it.\nPut some images in a frame and\n\n458\n00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.210\nsee see what happens with that.\n\n459\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:14.690\nSome of the other things that we might run\ninto is that we might see jaggedy images.\n\n460\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.060\nThat's the technical term, jaggedy edges.\n\n461\n00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.080\nAnd what happens when I put\nsomething in In Design,\n\n462\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.540\nI put an image in In Design,\nit's putting a placeholder in there.\n\n463\n00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.190\nSo again it's not putting\nthe whole Photoshop file in there.\n\n464\n00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.580\nIt's putting this sort of screen\nresolution placeholder in there.\n\n465\n00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.430\nWell, it wants to show you that,\nat low resolution,\n\n466\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.400\nalthough did change this\nwith the new version.\n\n467\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.570\nSo some of the defaults,\nhave changed a little bit.\n\n468\n00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.610\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nput in some Images.\n\n469\n00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.050\nI think I already have that one.\n\n470\n00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.120\nLet's come in here and\nlook at the view display.\n\n471\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:47.990\nI already have this here.\n\n472\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.080\nAnd it does tell me my images are missing.\n\n473\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.090\nI might have to update those in a second.\n\n474\n00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.590\nBut when I zoom in on this image, let's\nactually really zoom in on this image.\n\n475\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.980\nWe can see how pixellated that is.\n\n476\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:00.780\nHopefully you can see that.\n\n477\n00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.370\nIf I zoom in a lot Of\ncourse it's pixellated but\n\n478\n00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.270\nit's always gonna be\npixellated at that view.\n\n479\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.170\nBut sometimes you're working\nat say this view and\n\n480\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.980\nhopefully you can see that it is jaggedy.\n\n481\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.900\nIt's not clear and\nI get this question asked all the time.\n\n482\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.760\nWhy do my images look so terrible?\n\n483\n00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.630\nI know it's a high resolution image,\nwell it is.\n\n484\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.620\nWhen it places it in InDesign, it wants\nto puts it at the screen resolution so\n\n485\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.590\nthat it saves on your processor.\n\n486\n00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.160\nSo what you can do is you can tell it\nlet's look at that in high resolution.\n\n487\n00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.570\nBut it will slow down your processor.\n\n488\n00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.030\nSo at that same thing,\neven here, with this image.\n\n489\n00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.190\nThis is a vector image.\n\n490\n00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.110\nNow vector images should always\nbeen nice and crisp and clear.\n\n491\n00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.490\nYou shouldn't ever see vector\nimages looking like that.\n\n492\n00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.990\nBut even so,\nin design dumbs those down as.\n\n493\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.310\nAs well and it says well I'm\ntrying to save you processor time.\n\n494\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.350\nWhen it comes to vector images\nthat's not really an issue.\n\n495\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.660\nIt's a computer and that's what it does,\n\n496\n00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.210\nit makes mathematical functions\nwhich is how it draws vectors.\n\n497\n00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.070\nSo let's actually change that.\n\n498\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.320\nSo by default It should be set.\n\n499\n00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.750\nI'm gonna go into Preferences,\nby the way, Cmd or Ctrl+K.\n\n500\n00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.660\nWe have something called\ndisplay performance.\n\n501\n00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.380\nThis only affects your graphics onscreen.\n\n502\n00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.000\nThis has nothing to do\nwith how they will print.\n\n503\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.190\nLater on, we'll talk about resolution How\nto make sure your images look good when we\n\n504\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.870\nexport them for Print or PDF,\nwe'll talk about resolution.\n\n505\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.710\nBut if you know it's high resolution and\nyou put it in and\n\n506\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.300\nit looks terrible this is\ngonna be the reason why.\n\n507\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.410\nSo you have a default view and\nI finally got this to work,\n\n508\n00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.590\nthis was having some trouble with\nthe update, so this might change back,\n\n509\n00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.400\nit kept changing back to high quality for\nme,\n\n510\n00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.690\nmaybe as soon as everybody has a nice fast\ncomputer now and it doesn't need do this.\n\n511\n00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.570\nBut, you might not, and so\nwe need to keep this here.\n\n512\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:39.050\nSo typical, I've got 3 different views;\ntypical, fast, and high quality.\n\n513\n00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:43.160\nFast will give me gray squares wherever I\nhave an image, that's not very helpful.\n\n514\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.230\nBut sometimes you just need to see how\nthings are laid out without worrying about\n\n515\n00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.180\nthe images.\n\n516\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.260\nHigh quality means its always going\nto show you, in that high, crisp,\n\n517\n00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.900\nquality which can slow down your computer.\n\n518\n00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.180\nSo, typical is there, and that just says,\nIt says, it's gonna show you to like 72\n\n519\n00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.980\nDPI or whatever the low resolution is but\nI can turn that on and off as I want.\n\n520\n00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.930\nSo, I'm gonna say okay to that right\nnow and just leave it at that.\n\n521\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.970\nI can come in here and I can say\nall right, I'm gonna right click or\n\n522\n00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:12.390\ncontrol click on the page, I wanna make\nsure nothing is selected when I do this.\n\n523\n00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.730\nRight click or control click,\ncome here to display performance And\n\n524\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.700\nI can choose one of those settings.\n\n525\n00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.210\nI can say, okay,\nmake everything at high quality display.\n\n526\n00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.030\nWhen I do that,\neverything should look a lot clearer and\n\n527\n00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.900\nit won't because I am missing graphics.\n\n528\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.800\nSo I'm gonna actually update my links\nreally quick just so you can see that.\n\n529\n00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.610\nSo you can actually see me do that but\nwe're gonna talk about that later as well.\n\n530\n00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.430\nI'm gonna update this one and\njust tell it to relink it.\n\n531\n00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:36.640\nI moved where it was sitting,\nprobably shouldn't have done that but\n\n532\n00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.840\nthat's what I did.\n\n533\n00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.820\nSo I'm gonna come in here and relink to\nthat same exact content that was here.\n\n534\n00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.570\nGraphics and Photos, and this one is\nthe travel logo, so we'll do that.\n\n535\n00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.145\nThen we'll say OK.\n\n536\n00:23:49.145 --> 00:23:52.214\nSo now when I do that, now that I\nactually have a link in here and\n\n537\n00:23:52.214 --> 00:23:54.474\nit knows where it lives it's nice and\nclear.\n\n538\n00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:58.236\nSame thing with this image, if I update\nthat that'll become clear as well, so\n\n539\n00:23:58.236 --> 00:23:59.500\nlet's actually do that.\n\n540\n00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.400\nI am gonna link that really quickly,\nto the same exact place.\n\n541\n00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.050\nIf it doesn't have a link to it, all it\ncan go on is what I put in there, and\n\n542\n00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:11.600\nwhat I put in there was the low\nresolution graphic, that's there.\n\n543\n00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.560\nSo, I'm gonna come back in here,\nand this is Maroon Bell's white.\n\n544\n00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.890\nWe'll do that.\n\n545\n00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.650\nAnd we'll say OK.\n\n546\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:21.170\nSo now we can actually see the results\nof that and I can come in here and say,\n\n547\n00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.970\ngreat, let's view that only\nat high quality, okay?\n\n548\n00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:28.130\nSo we got the High Quality Display\nsetting and now we can see it clearer.\n\n549\n00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.150\nNow, it doesn't look great\nbecause the more I zoom in,\n\n550\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.340\nthe more pixelated it will be of course.\n\n551\n00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.990\nAll right so we can do that.\n\n552\n00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.230\nAnd you notice when I'm scrolling,\nhopefully you can see it,\n\n553\n00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.250\nwhen I'm scrolling that logo\nat the bottom is jaggedy.\n\n554\n00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.940\nAnd as soon as I let go,\nit smooths it out.\n\n555\n00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.350\nSo again, it's still trying\nto save your processor time.\n\n556\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.710\nJust know that that's one way that you\nmight be able to clear up those images.\n\n557\n00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.440\nYou can also do that on\nan image by image basis.\n\n558\n00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.480\nI can just come in here and\nselect this one item, control click or\n\n559\n00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.210\nright click on it, and\ntell it Display Performance.\n\n560\n00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.010\nInstead of being typical,\nI can say Use the View Setting.\n\n561\n00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.610\nAnd if I do that, it will use whatever I\nset for the page which is high quality or\n\n562\n00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.140\nI can individually turn on items on and\noff.\n\n563\n00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.400\nSo, let's do that.\n\n564\n00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.430\nWhen I zoom in,\nI can see that that's pretty clear, and\n\n565\n00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:15.060\nnow I know that I'm working with a good,\nclear copy on screen.\n\n566\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.090\nLet's go back to that\npreference really quick, and\n\n567\n00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.320\nI'm gonna show you one thing\nyou can do to speed that up.\n\n568\n00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.830\nSo, command or control K, again,\nbrings up your Preferences.\n\n569\n00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.701\nIt's under Display Performance,\nunder typical,\n\n570\n00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:28.210\nI've told it that's the default view.\n\n571\n00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.740\nI'm gonna keep it at that.\n\n572\n00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.520\nBut I can also define what\neach of those views are.\n\n573\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.260\nI'm gonna leave fast and\nhigh quality as they are.\n\n574\n00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:39.280\nFast is all the sliders to the left, and\nhigh quality they're all to the right.\n\n575\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.220\nBut typical, generally, looks like this.\n\n576\n00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.797\nSo it says vector graphics should\nbe that proxy, 72-ish DPI,\n\n577\n00:25:46.797 --> 00:25:48.320\nand but I don't need that.\n\n578\n00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.430\nBecause I know as a vector I should\nbe able to see that in high quality\n\n579\n00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:52.290\nno matter what I do.\n\n580\n00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.450\nSo I'm actually just gonna\nslide that to the right.\n\n581\n00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.030\nSo I just redefined what typical means.\n\n582\n00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.310\nThat way, my vector images will always be\ncrisp and clear and I don't have to worry\n\n583\n00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.360\nabout trying to, I've lined things up more\noften to vector images, where I need to be\n\n584\n00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.780\nreally precise and line it up, where that\npixelization actually throws me off.\n\n585\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.060\nSo I need to always know that my vector\nimages are always gonna look really clear.\n\n586\n00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.350\nSo that's just again\nhow it looks on screen.\n\n587\n00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.150\nHas nothing to do with how that's\ngoing to print or export at all.\n\n588\n00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.380\nAnd again we'll look at\nresolution in a future episode.\n\n589\n00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:29.080\nThe last thing I wanna talk about in this\nepisode is specialty or compound frames.\n\n590\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.140\nSo right now, we're just been putting\nimages inside rectangular frames but\n\n591\n00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.790\nmaybe we wanna do something\nthat is a little different so\n\n592\n00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.530\nI'm gonna open up\na different graphic here.\n\n593\n00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.100\nI'm gonna come over here and\nwe'll look at this compound pass.\n\n594\n00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.020\nSo I have this grid laid out, right?\n\n595\n00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.480\nSo it's just, a bunch of image, a bunch\nof graphics frames that I did step and\n\n596\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.490\nrepeat on.\n\n597\n00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.520\nOr there's also a script, if you want\nto get into scripts you can look\n\n598\n00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.930\nthat up in that help file\nthat we talked about earlier.\n\n599\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.210\nYou can do a script, there's a script\nbuilt in that says I can make a rectangle,\n\n600\n00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.240\nnow break it into a ton of little\nrectangles, and that's what I want to do.\n\n601\n00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.456\nSo right now I just have all these\ndifferent rectangles that are here.\n\n602\n00:27:05.456 --> 00:27:09.080\nHowever you did it, you can copy and paste\nit, and use smart guides to line them up\n\n603\n00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.180\nwhatever, but I can take all of these and\nyou notice they have little each one have\n\n604\n00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.400\nas x that means I can bring in multiple\nfiles and I can place them in here, right.\n\n605\n00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.315\nSo I can drop those in and\nactually let me back up really quick cuz I\n\n606\n00:27:21.315 --> 00:27:24.560\nrealized I did not cover multiple\nfiles of different types.\n\n607\n00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.790\nWe brought in multiple images.\n\n608\n00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.830\nLet me just add that really quick cuz it\nactually feeds in nicely to this piece.\n\n609\n00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.530\nI just added a new page.\n\n610\n00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:37.150\nI'm gonna do Cmd or Ctrl+D to place and\nI'm gonna back up here to I\n\n611\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:42.025\nbelieve, Let's come in here too.\n\n612\n00:27:43.738 --> 00:27:48.470\nPlacing assets, which is out here and\nI have this place multiple files, so\n\n613\n00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.730\nI can place files that are Illustrator,\nPDFs, JPEGs.\n\n614\n00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.350\nI have some rich text,\nI have a text file here.\n\n615\n00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.300\nAnd I can bring those all in at once.\n\n616\n00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.320\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n617\n00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.260\nSo that's from the desktop.\n\n618\n00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.980\nI'm gonna grab,\ninstead of grabbing multiple images,\n\n619\n00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.050\nI'm gonna grab everything,\na little bit of everything.\n\n620\n00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.640\nAnd I'm not gonna say show import options,\n\n621\n00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.590\nthat will take me forever to\nclick through and I'll say open.\n\n622\n00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:13.540\nAnd now when I place that,\nhere's my PDF file.\n\n623\n00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.280\nRight?\nSo, I got to place\n\n624\n00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.740\nall the images to the PDF.\n\n625\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.212\nLook there's a text file,\nhere's an image Image file, that's a JPEG,\n\n626\n00:28:19.212 --> 00:28:22.190\nhere's an Illustrator file,\nand that's all I had was that.\n\n627\n00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.650\nSo I have all those multiple ones,\nso just keep in mind,\n\n628\n00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.640\nyou don't have to place\nall of the same type.\n\n629\n00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.640\nYou can grab everything you need for that\ndocument, plunk it all on the page, and\n\n630\n00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.403\nthen worry about where\nthat sits on the the page.\n\n631\n00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.100\nI just side stepped there a little bit,\nmake sure we got that covered.\n\n632\n00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.910\nAnd I'm gonna go back to these frames and\nthese are individual frames so\n\n633\n00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:44.016\nif I brought in those multiple items,\nwhether they're all the same type or not,\n\n634\n00:28:44.016 --> 00:28:47.720\nI could click on each one and\nit will place it inside that frame.\n\n635\n00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.600\nBut what I really want,\nis I want this to be one Graphics frame\n\n636\n00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.740\nwhere it kinda looks like a window pane,\nis what it's gonna end up looking like.\n\n637\n00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.790\nI have all these individual grids, and\nI wanna place it, one image in there and\n\n638\n00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:02.360\nhave it show up in all the different\nindividual squares that are there.\n\n639\n00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.250\nSo to do that,\nI have to create a compound path.\n\n640\n00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.320\nSo I'm gonna select all of these,\n\n641\n00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.820\nI'm just gonna drag across all\nof the items that are here.\n\n642\n00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.991\nI'm going to go up under the Object menu,\nand choose\n\n643\n00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:17.532\nI'm gonna choose Paths, and I'm gonna\ncome in here to Make Compound Path.\n\n644\n00:29:17.532 --> 00:29:21.380\nSo I'm gonna do that, and notice instead\nof all these little individual x's for\n\n645\n00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.230\nindividual graphics frames, it's going\nto give me one big X that's gonna say\n\n646\n00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.120\nthis is actually one, big compound frame.\n\n647\n00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.070\nMake compound path.\n\n648\n00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.640\nNow I've got one big X.\n\n649\n00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.870\nNow when I bring in an item, and I have\nit selected, so I'll leave it selected.\n\n650\n00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.930\nSo, even though there's still individual\nitems and I can still sort of manipulate\n\n651\n00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:41.188\nthem individually, takes a little bit\nof extra effort, I tend not to make\n\n652\n00:29:41.188 --> 00:29:43.890\na compound path until I'm pretty sure\nI've got it laid out where I want.\n\n653\n00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.870\nOnly cuz you have to step\nbackwards to make changes to it.\n\n654\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.100\nBut I'm gonna do command or control D,\nor I can go up to the file menu and\n\n655\n00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.540\nchoose place.\n\n656\n00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.470\nAnd replace that item.\n\n657\n00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.420\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n658\n00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.520\nwe'll just grab, let's grab that one,\nthat looks good.\n\n659\n00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.780\nAnd I'm gonna say replace selected item.\n\n660\n00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.330\nSo it's gonna automatically\nplunk it right in there.\n\n661\n00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:02.960\nNow it drops it in there and\nthere we have it.\n\n662\n00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.120\nIt's individual, it's one frame,\n\n663\n00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.760\nit's a compound frame made\nfrom those individual ones.\n\n664\n00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.290\nWhen I roll over it,\nyou notice it's over here.\n\n665\n00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.240\nSo that content grabber that's\nnormally in the center, for\n\n666\n00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.290\nwhatever reason when I make compound\nframes it throws it wherever.\n\n667\n00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.020\nIt's sort of random.\n\n668\n00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:17.850\nBut the nice thing is,\n\n669\n00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:21.000\nif you have that content grabber turned\non, you roll over it, it shows up.\n\n670\n00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.200\nJust grab it there.\n\n671\n00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.570\nI'm gonna click and hold,\nif you notice it's a little short, right?\n\n672\n00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.240\nSo I don't quite have it\nfilling up the entire thing.\n\n673\n00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.020\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do is\nclick on this so I have the image.\n\n674\n00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.490\nI'm gonna hold down my shift key and\n\n675\n00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.820\njust make sure that it actually\nfills up all those frames.\n\n676\n00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.150\nNow I can move that wherever I need,\n\n677\n00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.920\nuntil I decide it looks good\nlet's drop that in there.\n\n678\n00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.760\nAnd again, those are all individual items\nthat I had created into one compound path.\n\n679\n00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.200\nAnd the last compound path\nthat I wanna show you,\n\n680\n00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.780\nis that you can actually take text and\ndo the same thing.\n\n681\n00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.470\nSo I'm gonna make a text frame and\nI know we haven't done much with text yet,\n\n682\n00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.130\nwe're gonna be getting\nto that really soon.\n\n683\n00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.730\nWe like to start with the pretty pictures\nfirst and actually make it look good.\n\n684\n00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.862\nThen we'll put text in there, right?\n\n685\n00:31:01.862 --> 00:31:04.230\nAnd we don't know what we need to say\nuntil we know what the images are.\n\n686\n00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.270\nI'm just gonna put some text in there.\n\n687\n00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.310\nDon't worry so\nmuch about what I'm doing with that but\n\n688\n00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.370\nI'm just gonna draw some text.\n\n689\n00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:10.540\nYou might already have this in there.\n\n690\n00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.990\nYou might have already worked with text.\n\n691\n00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.598\nBut I've got some, an image there.\n\n692\n00:31:15.598 --> 00:31:19.200\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and tell it,\nI would like that to be a frame.\n\n693\n00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.418\nIn fact,\nI'd like to put a picture inside there.\n\n694\n00:31:21.418 --> 00:31:24.890\nWell I'm gonna go up and choose\nthe text frame, not the text itself,\n\n695\n00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:29.120\nI'm using the selection tool to select the\nframe, because I'm actually manipulating\n\n696\n00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.070\nthe frame as a whole, so\nsometimes it gets confusing.\n\n697\n00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.630\nAm I working with the text or the frame?\n\n698\n00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.850\nI'm gonna go up under the object menu and\nI'm gonna go ahead and tell it, I'm sorry.\n\n699\n00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:41.300\nI'm gonna go to the type menu and\nchoose create outlines.\n\n700\n00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:45.270\nAnd when I do that,\nthat actually created a compound path.\n\n701\n00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.930\nIn fact if I go down\nto the object menu and\n\n702\n00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.770\ncome down to paths,\nit says release compound path.\n\n703\n00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.100\nSo it already made one for me.\n\n704\n00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.670\nI can release it at this point,\nbut I won't.\n\n705\n00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:54.690\nI want to keep it.\n\n706\n00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.890\nSo now I can actually put\nan image inside there.\n\n707\n00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:02.160\nCommand or Control D, let's grab a picture\nof Venice, replace the selected item.\n\n708\n00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.920\nWhen I do that there's\nthat image inside there.\n\n709\n00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.438\nNow it's pretty big so\nI can say, Object, Fitting, and\n\n710\n00:32:07.438 --> 00:32:10.050\nI can fill that frame proportionally.\n\n711\n00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.380\nSo it shrinks it down nicely.\n\n712\n00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.270\nIf I click and hold on it,\nI can see where that sits, and\n\n713\n00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.110\nI can move it wherever I need to.\n\n714\n00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:21.010\nMaybe I wanna make sure that the dome\nis actually showing up in there.\n\n715\n00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.634\nSo I might just play with that a little\nbit, maybe it feels a little bit more,\n\n716\n00:32:23.634 --> 00:32:24.680\na little less sky.\n\n717\n00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.960\nAnyway, I can put that around\nuntil I get it set up.\n\n718\n00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.940\nMaybe I just wanted\nthe buildings to show up.\n\n719\n00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.090\nBut I can use text as a frame.\n\n720\n00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.120\nSo by converting outlines,\nwhich is under the type menu,\n\n721\n00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.880\nconverting outlines, it automatically\ncreates that compound frame,\n\n722\n00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.330\njust like we did with\nthe rectangles that are there.\n\n723\n00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:42.050\n>> Erica, thank you for\nall that great information.\n\n724\n00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.120\n>> Absolutely.\n>> And thank you also for\n\n725\n00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.390\nthrowing a little extra in there.\n\n726\n00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:45.765\nWe always like when that happens too.\n\n727\n00:32:45.765 --> 00:32:46.500\nBut looking at the clock,\n\n728\n00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.300\nit does look like we've come to the end of\nanother great episode but before we sign\n\n729\n00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.430\nout do you have an additional\nword you would like to throw in?\n\n730\n00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.000\n>> Nope.\nI think we covered it all.\n\n731\n00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.160\n>> That's very good.\n\n732\n00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.330\nWell we appreciate you joining us in the\nstudios and we appreciate you the viewers.\n\n733\n00:32:58.330 --> 00:32:59.380\nSigning out for ITProTV TV.\n\n734\n00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.390\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n735\n00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:01.942\n>> And I'm Erica Gamet.\n\n736\n00:33:01.942 --> 00:33:02.635\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n737\n00:33:02.635 --> 00:33:09.690\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.095\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:21.451\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing to\nour Series in Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.720\nDiving into InDesign,\njoining me back in the studios yet\n\n6\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.890\nagain is Erica Gammon,\nErica how you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.650\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.350\n>> All right, very good, so what are we\ngonna be looking at in this episode?\n\n9\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.639\n>> We're gonna start managing some of our\nassets that we have in our documents.\n\n10\n00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:37.210\nSo we're gonna work with links and we're\ngonna start putting them together, and\n\n11\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.899\nwe also gonna do some staff in\na little bit more laying out, and\n\n12\n00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.730\na little bit more organised fashion.\n\n13\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.100\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\njump into that, I just got a nice\n\n14\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.510\nblank document at the moment, but\nwe gonna start putting some items in here.\n\n15\n00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.230\nSo I'm gonna put multiple items, we saw on\nour previous episode that we can bring in\n\n16\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.400\nmultiple images together, or even\nmultiple asset that are different types,\n\n17\n00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.560\ntexts, PDFs and different graphic files.\n\n18\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.130\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\njust bring in a bunch of JPEGs and\n\n19\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.020\nwe're gonna lay them out in a way.\n\n20\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.430\nInstead of laying out the grid first and\n\n21\n00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.520\nplacing each image inside there which is\nsomething we've done in previous episodes.\n\n22\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.740\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nbring them all in together but\n\n23\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.490\nI want to lay them out in a nice grid.\n\n24\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.650\nAnd I'm gonna show you a secret\ntool it doesn't live anywhere.\n\n25\n00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.880\nIt's not actually a tool, it's a feature.\n\n26\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.100\nBut it doesn't live anywhere,\nit doesn't have a menu item,\n\n27\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.820\nit doesn't have a tool attached to it.\n\n28\n00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.220\nIt's just sort of one of those secret\nhandshake things you have to know about.\n\n29\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.730\nSo I'm gonna tell you about that,\ndon't tell anyone.\n\n30\n00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.033\nAll right, so I'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna load up several images.\n\n31\n00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:37.883\nSo I'm gonna go up to the File menu and\nchoose file place or\n\n32\n00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:40.545\nI can use command or control D to place.\n\n33\n00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:42.380\nI'm gonna choose that and say place.\n\n34\n00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.560\nI'm gonna go out and find some assets that\nI have here and I'm gonna come in here to\n\n35\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.356\nFiles and\nI'm gonna choose my content here.\n\n36\n00:01:52.356 --> 00:01:56.460\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nalso go into Graphics and Photos and\n\n37\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.090\nTravel, I'm gonna just keep\ndrilling down until I find them.\n\n38\n00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.278\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead\nto my Italy pictures and\n\n39\n00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:03.924\nI'm gonna choose these Venice\npictures that are here.\n\n40\n00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:06.697\nAnd I actually wanna make\nsure I choose some wide ones,\n\n41\n00:02:06.697 --> 00:02:08.157\nthese are all nice and wide.\n\n42\n00:02:08.157 --> 00:02:11.288\nThe only reason I wanna do that is I want\neverything to fit beautifully for me.\n\n43\n00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:13.893\nSo I'm gonna say choose these six images.\n\n44\n00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:16.518\nI'm gonna make sure\nShow Import Options is not turned on,\n\n45\n00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:20.350\ncuz I don't want to tell it okay for every\none, and I'm gonna go ahead and say Open.\n\n46\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.260\nNow, when I do that,\nI've got my loaded place cursor.\n\n47\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.210\nI can see that I have six\nimages loaded in here.\n\n48\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.940\nNow I can place them like I have been,\noops let's actually zoom back out there.\n\n49\n00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.810\nI can place them as I have been by\nclicking and dragging to place them or\n\n50\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.104\nI can place them in a nice grid all at\nonce using the secret item that's here.\n\n51\n00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:43.000\nSo to do that, and\nactually I wanna change my file.\n\n52\n00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.800\nI'm gonna actually change that to a wide\nfile just so that I have a nice wide,\n\n53\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.620\nbecause I'm working with\na bunch of wide images.\n\n54\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.830\nLet's do that I'm just gonna\ncreate a new one really quickly,\n\n55\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.280\nand I'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n56\n00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.460\nLoad up those same images,\none through six.\n\n57\n00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.906\nThey're all wide images and\nI've got that loaded place cursor.\n\n58\n00:02:59.906 --> 00:03:03.969\nNow what I can do is I can start\ndragging out that image and when I do,\n\n59\n00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.829\nit automatically says,\nyou must want a wide frame, right?\n\n60\n00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.079\nWe've done this before, a million\ntimes but what I really wanna do is,\n\n61\n00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.029\nI wanna place them all\nin a grid like this and\n\n62\n00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:15.370\nI want them to all be lined up nice and\nneat.\n\n63\n00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.120\nSo, I have to use the secret item, this\nis a bring a friend shortcut as well or\n\n64\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.890\none that we have to do kind of some\nacrobatics here to get it to work\n\n65\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.290\nespecially on a laptop.\n\n66\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.205\nIf you're right handed,\nbecause it involves using the mouse key,\n\n67\n00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:28.595\nwhich I'm still holding down.\n\n68\n00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:29.547\nI haven't let go of it yet.\n\n69\n00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:31.670\nI've got all six images loaded,\nready to go.\n\n70\n00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.770\nHolding down the mouse key\nmy thumb is getting tired.\n\n71\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.460\nBut there it is holding it down.\n\n72\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.710\nAnd I want to cross my hands\nover to the arrow keys.\n\n73\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.930\nAll right, so on the laptop,\nthat's kind of reversed.\n\n74\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.720\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit\nthe arrow key, the up arrow key once.\n\n75\n00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.230\nAnd when I do that, I now can see that\nI have two frames ready to go, and\n\n76\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.570\nthat I just made a second row.\n\n77\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.550\nI'm gonna do that one more time.\n\n78\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.890\nSo now I have three rows.\n\n79\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.990\nNow I know I have six images.\n\n80\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.440\nSo I'm gonna now do three rows and\nI also wanna make a second column so\n\n81\n00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.640\nI have space for all six images.\n\n82\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.180\nSo, I'm gonna use the right arrow key,\nand now I have an extra row.\n\n83\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.133\nSo as I use the right and\nleft arrow keys and the up and\n\n84\n00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:11.550\ndown arrow keys I can add and\nsubtract rows and columns.\n\n85\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.830\nNow I am still holding down the mouse key\nand at this point I'll just drag it out\n\n86\n00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.650\nto the size I want but I'm not gonna let\ngo yet I might wanna the amount of gap.\n\n87\n00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.000\nI can see how much gap is in between\nthose frames that are there and\n\n88\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.599\nI wanna change that and this sometimes\nworks, sometimes takes two or\n\n89\n00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.479\nthree three times to get it to work.\n\n90\n00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.540\nThis is again a bring a friend shortcut\nbecause what I need to do is hold\n\n91\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.810\ndown my command key and also my up and\ndown arrow keys, so that's fun, so\n\n92\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.280\nwe are going to hold down the command key.\n\n93\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.110\nAnd I'm using the up arrow key as well, so\nI'm holding the mouse button, it would be\n\n94\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.100\ngreat if we had an aerial shot of this\nbecause you see what my hands are doing,\n\n95\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.090\nI've got the command with my pinky\nmy thumb I'm using the up and\n\n96\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.090\ndown arrow keys.\n\n97\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.761\nBut I'm holding down the Command key,\nor Control on a PC, and using the up and\n\n98\n00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:56.208\ndown arrow keys to change\nthe gap between the rows.\n\n99\n00:04:56.208 --> 00:05:00.143\nThe right and left arrow key will\nchange the gap between the columns.\n\n100\n00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:03.203\nNow if you have them set up and you don't\nhave to change the gap then you don't have\n\n101\n00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:04.970\nto worry about that\nextra keyboard shortcut.\n\n102\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.259\nI'm still holding down\nthe keyboard mouse the whole time,\n\n103\n00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.780\nlet's actually see what happens now.\n\n104\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.920\nWhat is it we've been\ndoing is when I let go\n\n105\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.410\nI now have those frames already laid out.\n\n106\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.850\nBut if you notice the images\ndon't fit quite nicely.\n\n107\n00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.730\nWe looked at placing in a prior episode.\n\n108\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.480\nSorry, fitting, so\nfitting the content to the frame.\n\n109\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.940\nSo we can actually do that, I'm actually\ngonna go up now that I have those frames,\n\n110\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.110\nI can see those are nice wide frames.\n\n111\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.380\nBut my images are almost square they're\na little bit square proportions.\n\n112\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.700\nSo we open the object menu.\n\n113\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.580\nI still have all of those selected,\nand I can come down to fitting and\n\n114\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.520\nsay fill frame proportion.\n\n115\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.280\nSo I can do that and they're all set\nup in this nice little grid for me.\n\n116\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.520\nNow, there's an easier way to do this.\n\n117\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.630\nI'm gonna hit delete,\nwe're gonna get rid of all that.\n\n118\n00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.000\nWhen I created this document, I'm gonna go\nback all the way to the beginning when we\n\n119\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.970\nfirst started with a new document,\ncommand or ctrl+N for new document.\n\n120\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.520\nOne of the options we talked\nabout was columns and gutter.\n\n121\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.449\nNow I think I'm not gonna\nwork with columns, so\n\n122\n00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.194\nwhat do I need to know\nabout the gutter for?\n\n123\n00:06:05.194 --> 00:06:09.954\nThe gutter,\nthis 0.1667 whatever that is, right?\n\n124\n00:06:09.954 --> 00:06:11.577\nIt's almost a quarter, I don't know,\n\n125\n00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:14.850\nit's one of those weird measurements\nthat's there by default.\n\n126\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.430\nBut that is the amount of gutter that's\nbetween that grid that we're using,\n\n127\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.210\nthat secret grid.\n\n128\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.260\nIt automatically says, well,\nwhat am I gonna do for a gutter?\n\n129\n00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.618\nWell, it has this value,\nso that's what it grabs.\n\n130\n00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:27.040\nSo I could say, okay,\nlet's actually make that a half an inch.\n\n131\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.110\nSo we can do that even though\nwe didn't really need,\n\n132\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.910\nwe didn't need that to be\ncolumns we just have one column.\n\n133\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.170\nI put a gutter in there but I only have\none column, so it doesn't even show up.\n\n134\n00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.870\nBut what it does is it tells us how\nmuch gap between those columns.\n\n135\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.030\nSo I'm gonna go here and\ngo back to Document Setup, and\n\n136\n00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.400\nI I want to tell it that it's\na wide document as well,\n\n137\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.570\njust because I know I'm\nworking with this wide grid.\n\n138\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.300\nSo I'm gonna do the same thing command or\ncontrol+D, load up those same images and\n\n139\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.402\ndo the same thing.\n\n140\n00:06:54.402 --> 00:06:56.880\nI'm gonna use my up and down arrow keys.\n\n141\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.700\nUp get three rows and right and now I've\ngot that nice half inch gap that's there.\n\n142\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.310\nSo I don't have to do that whole\nthing with the command and\n\n143\n00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.070\ncontrol key to do that.\n\n144\n00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.860\nSo I can do that and let go.\n\n145\n00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.850\nBut again, the fitting isn't perfect,\nso let's change that.\n\n146\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.780\nSo in a prior episode I said that if you\nset a default with nothing selected in\n\n147\n00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.790\nin a document, that generally becomes\nthe default behavior for that document.\n\n148\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.620\nYou could also do this with no document\nopen, and it becomes default behavior for\n\n149\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.070\nall new documents.\n\n150\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.180\nSo the default behavior I want to select,\nand I'm gonna do it just for\n\n151\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.910\nthis particular document, is I want to\ntell it every time I place an image,\n\n152\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.300\nautomatically fill that\nframe proportionally,\n\n153\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.330\ndon't make me, go into the fitting\nmenu and change it afterwards.\n\n154\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.249\nI want to change that right now.\n\n155\n00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:46.371\nSo, to do that,\nwe're gonna go up to our Object menu.\n\n156\n00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:48.644\nWe're gonna say Object and\nwe're gonna go down to Fitting.\n\n157\n00:07:48.644 --> 00:07:50.921\nAnd at the bottom of Fitting\nis Frame Fitting Options.\n\n158\n00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:52.035\nSo we're gonna do this ahead of time.\n\n159\n00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:53.283\nNow everytime I place it,\n\n160\n00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:56.020\nit will automatically fill\nthat frame proportionally.\n\n161\n00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.880\nSo I'm gonna come in here,\nand I'm gonna choose Fitting.\n\n162\n00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.015\nThese are the same options we\nsee in the Fitting menu, but\n\n163\n00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:01.680\nwe can choose them ahead of time.\n\n164\n00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.750\nSo I wanna say Fill Frame Proportionally.\n\n165\n00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.990\nI also can tell it where to fill from.\n\n166\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.150\nSo this is, again,\nwhere are the line's from.\n\n167\n00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.260\nSo this just means what part of the image.\n\n168\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.370\nWe've got the grab handles.\n\n169\n00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.770\nI told you there's nine grab handles.\n\n170\n00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.350\nThese are the nine grab handles.\n\n171\n00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.707\nSo, I have the center one selected.\n\n172\n00:08:15.707 --> 00:08:20.110\nSo that says automatically fill it\nproportionally from the center outwards.\n\n173\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.700\nNow if you know that you shot a lot\nof the images and all your subjects\n\n174\n00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.840\nare off to the left, you could tell it\nto align from the left if you want to.\n\n175\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.870\nGenerally speaking, I keep it on there.\n\n176\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.220\nI'm gonna turn on Auto-Fit in a moment and\nI'll show you what auto fit is.\n\n177\n00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.860\nI can also choose to crop\nout a certain amount.\n\n178\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.250\nIf you know that the outside eighth of an\ninch is always stuff you wanna crop out,\n\n179\n00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.000\nyou can put that in there.\n\n180\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.680\nI'm gonna leave that off though.\n\n181\n00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.810\nSo now when I do that same exact thing,\n\n182\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.550\nCmd or Ctrl+D, I'm gonna load up those\nsix images, same thing we've been doing.\n\n183\n00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.030\nI've got a nice half inch of gap.\n\n184\n00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:53.030\nI'm gonna start drawing up arrow\nkey twice, right arrow key once.\n\n185\n00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.500\nAnd now I'm gonna make them even\nlike they're just super narrow, but\n\n186\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.020\nI know that those images are bigger.\n\n187\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.840\nI'm gonna let go, and\nit automatically filled them up.\n\n188\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.582\nNow, some of them don't fit exactly right.\n\n189\n00:09:02.582 --> 00:09:07.050\nI am gonna have to come in here and\ndo my arrow keys, move this around.\n\n190\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.220\nMaybe I need to make it bigger.\n\n191\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.750\nI can't make it smaller because it's\nalready as small as it can be width wise.\n\n192\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.775\nBut I need to maybe just\nmake a few adjustments.\n\n193\n00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:14.320\nStill, it looks good.\n\n194\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.450\nI'm using my up and\ndown arrow keys to move this, but\n\n195\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.470\nif I hold down my Shift key, it\nmultiplies that jump by five, I believe,\n\n196\n00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.090\nit could be ten but I think it's five.\n\n197\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.380\nSo if I wanna move them a lot quicker, I\ncan hold down the Shift key and say, okay,\n\n198\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:26.990\nthat looks good.\n\n199\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.080\nDo a little bit of precision work and\nit looks exactly as I need it to.\n\n200\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.880\nThat's called the gridify feature,\nand it doesn't just work\n\n201\n00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.490\nwhen you're placing images,\nit also works when you're creating frames.\n\n202\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.710\nSo let's go back to our shape frame here,\nmy Rectangle Tool, and\n\n203\n00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.600\nI'm just going to start\ndrawing a rectangle out.\n\n204\n00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.550\nIf I just draw and let go,\nthere's my rectangle.\n\n205\n00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.390\nBut maybe I want to have several\nof those in a nice grid.\n\n206\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.960\nSo I'm gonna start dragging those out and\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit the up and\n\n207\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.780\ndown arrow keys.\n\n208\n00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.680\nAnd when I'm doing that,\nI'm actually creating all of these grids.\n\n209\n00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.190\nIn fact, in a previous movie,\nwe looked at compound frames and\n\n210\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.600\nI had a whole bunch of rectangles\nthat I grouped together and\n\n211\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.080\nmade one path,\nthis is actually how I did it.\n\n212\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.880\nSo I just use the up and down arrow\nkeys till I get several of those.\n\n213\n00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.660\nI can hold down the Shift key at the last\nminute so I get nice squares if I want.\n\n214\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.820\nAnd then I can let go, and\nthese are all individual frames.\n\n215\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.040\nI can do that with the graphics frames or\nthe unassigned shape frames if I want.\n\n216\n00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.280\nBut it's a quick way to get those all\nin the page super, super quickly and\n\n217\n00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.312\nnot have to draw them and duplicate them.\n\n218\n00:10:27.312 --> 00:10:29.900\nThere are other ways to do it,\nbut this is a quick way to do it.\n\n219\n00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.520\nAgain, it's called gridify.\n\n220\n00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.640\nYou won't find it anywhere.\n\n221\n00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.950\nYou might find it in Help, but I'm not\neven sure if gridify is the official term.\n\n222\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.410\nIt's what everybody calls it, but it's one\nof those secret things that's just there.\n\n223\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.740\nI'm gonna jump back to this page here and\nwe have this grid set up.\n\n224\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.210\nBut now what I wanna do is I wanna\nchange the amount of space between\n\n225\n00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.020\neach of those images.\n\n226\n00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.200\nSo we have this nice half inch,\nand that's fine.\n\n227\n00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.150\nI just wanna change where those items sit.\n\n228\n00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.740\nSo maybe I don't want a nice,\nperfectly laid out grid.\n\n229\n00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.070\nI might wanna make some of them shorter.\n\n230\n00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.640\nSo I can do that with the Gap Tool, and\nthat's what this tool over here is.\n\n231\n00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.860\nThis little thing here is the Gap Tool,\nI'm gonna select it.\n\n232\n00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.080\nAnd when I do that, and hopefully\nyou can see it on the screen, and\n\n233\n00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.560\nit looks like you can, good,\nit puts a gray area on the gap.\n\n234\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.660\nSo, if I roll over this middle column,\nit automatically sees that entire gap,\n\n235\n00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.800\nanything all the way up\nto where images end.\n\n236\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.010\nAnd it doesn't just have to be images.\n\n237\n00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.440\nIt could be anything, but it's always\ngonna be based on that bounding box.\n\n238\n00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.460\nSo everything will be square.\n\n239\n00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.740\nThe gaps are always gonna be rectangular.\n\n240\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.580\nSo I can say, okay,\nthat's a gap, that's great.\n\n241\n00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.990\nBut what I can do is I can click in\nthe gap and move this item over.\n\n242\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.230\nAnd when I do that,\neverything moves together,\n\n243\n00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.650\nit shortens it up,\nright, so I can do that.\n\n244\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.400\nSo we'll let go of that.\n\n245\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.420\nI can also hold down the Shift key.\n\n246\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.660\nWhen I hold down the Shift key,\nI move that over.\n\n247\n00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.960\nWhoops, it should be moving the image.\n\n248\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.860\nNow it is moving the image next to it,\nbut my images are to size already.\n\n249\n00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.654\nLet's turn on the edges so\nwe can actually see what's happening.\n\n250\n00:11:59.654 --> 00:12:01.948\nSo I come over here and\nI hold the Shift key and\n\n251\n00:12:01.948 --> 00:12:04.370\nit only moves those two\nimages that are there.\n\n252\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.046\nSo, hopefully, you can see that frame\nthat's on the upper right is growing, but\n\n253\n00:12:08.046 --> 00:12:11.765\nbecause the image ended there, it doesn't\nlook like anything is moving with it.\n\n254\n00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:13.702\nBut I can move this one image over.\n\n255\n00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:16.670\nI could do the same thing down here,\nhold down the Shift key.\n\n256\n00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.770\nAnd by holding the Shift key,\n\n257\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.190\nI'm only working with the items that are\nimmediately on the other side of that gap.\n\n258\n00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.960\nIf I don't hold the Shift key,\nit goes all the way up as much as it can,\n\n259\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.000\nit moves everything.\n\n260\n00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.910\nThe Shift key only moves that.\n\n261\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.005\nAnd the cool thing is,\nif you can't remember the Shift key,\n\n262\n00:12:30.005 --> 00:12:32.370\nthere's also the Option\nkey you can work with.\n\n263\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.080\nAnd the Cmd key do different things like,\nfor instance,\n\n264\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.850\nthe Cmd key changes the size of the gap,\ngonna undo that.\n\n265\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:44.070\nAnd the Option key keeps the gap the same,\nbut moves the objects on either side.\n\n266\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.468\nIf you can't remember that, there's a\ngreat feature that they added a while back\n\n267\n00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:52.692\nunder the Window menu, under Utilities,\nyou have a thing called Tool Hints.\n\n268\n00:12:52.692 --> 00:12:54.635\nAnd I use it for\nthis one a lot because there are so\n\n269\n00:12:54.635 --> 00:12:57.791\nmany of other things you can do it, but\nwhen I have a tool selected, it tells me\n\n270\n00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:01.330\nall the different modifier keys and what\nthey do when you have that tool selected.\n\n271\n00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.300\nSo you can turn that on at any time and\nit just tells you some little hints for\n\n272\n00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.140\nthat particular tool.\n\n273\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.260\nI'm gonna undo that, back to where we\nhad everything laid out because when I\n\n274\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.580\nchanged that frame, that looked cool, but\nthe image, I would have to go back and\n\n275\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.350\nnow tell the image, I can either refit\nit and tell it fit proportionally, or\n\n276\n00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.990\nI can select it individually and resize\nit, or I can have InDesign do that for me.\n\n277\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.540\nAnd that's where that Auto-Fit comes in.\n\n278\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.680\nSo, I could set that up in my presets\nlike I did when I told it always fill\n\n279\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.760\nproportionally, I could tell\nit Auto-Fit automatically, or\n\n280\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.060\nI can do it after the fact.\n\n281\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.970\nLet's just do it after\nthe fact in this one.\n\n282\n00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.460\nI'm gonna select all the images cuz\nI want all of them to be auto-fit.\n\n283\n00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.690\nAnd what that does, and\nI'm gonna choose it here.\n\n284\n00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.120\nIt's in the Command or the Control panel.\n\n285\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.450\nIf you don't see stuff,\nit may be over here in this panel menu\n\n286\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.530\nwhich I did not mentioned\nin the beginning.\n\n287\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.314\nI always forget that it's\nthere until I need it.\n\n288\n00:13:51.314 --> 00:13:54.380\nIt's a panel menu, and\nmany of the panels have them.\n\n289\n00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.460\nIt's also called the hamburger sometimes.\n\n290\n00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.600\nI don't know why,\nit's a little stacked thing.\n\n291\n00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.590\nIt's just a little menu, and so if you\nsee that there, a lot of options for\n\n292\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.120\ndifferent panels show up under that menu.\n\n293\n00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.330\nAnd in the Control panel, they come and go\nbecause the Control panel is contextual,\n\n294\n00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.320\nand sometimes there's a lot\nof stuff that has to fit in.\n\n295\n00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.060\nAnd if you're working\non a smaller monitor or\n\n296\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.232\na lower resolution, it can't fit as much.\n\n297\n00:14:15.232 --> 00:14:19.560\nSo it just throws everything into that\nmenu if it doesn't fit in the icons.\n\n298\n00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.310\nSo if it's not here, look there.\n\n299\n00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.530\nBut, here's where Auto-Fit is.\n\n300\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.910\nI've got all the images selected.\n\n301\n00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.430\nI'm gonna go ahead and choose Auto-Fit.\n\n302\n00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.930\nAnd what that's gonna do is, before,\nI told it, fill the frame proportionally.\n\n303\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.230\nBut when I change the size of that frame,\nthe image stayed where it was.\n\n304\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.480\nIt doesn't keep telling it and do it\nagain, and do it again, and do it again.\n\n305\n00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.710\nThat's what Auto-Fit does.\n\n306\n00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.370\nIt says,\nyou chose fill frame proportionally,\n\n307\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.530\nnow when I change the frame,\nI should change the image for you.\n\n308\n00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.220\nSo it does that automatically.\n\n309\n00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.690\nSo now when we go back to that Gap Tool,\nall of them have Auto-Fit turned on.\n\n310\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.432\nI'm gonna hold the Shift key down and\njust move this item slightly to the left.\n\n311\n00:14:55.432 --> 00:14:59.524\nAnd when I do that, you notice my image\nis getting bigger because it says,\n\n312\n00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.830\nyou wanna keep filling\nthat frame proportionally.\n\n313\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:03.475\nSo I can do that.\n\n314\n00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:05.030\nI'm gonna move this guy over the same,\n\n315\n00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.930\nand I'm gonna come here to the left,\nand I have Smart Guides turned on.\n\n316\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:13.480\nSo you can see the green line that's\nlined up right now the bottom left image.\n\n317\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.570\nThe right side of the bottom left image is\nlined up with the left side of the upper\n\n318\n00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:18.130\nright image.\n\n319\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.890\nHow's that for a brain twister?\n\n320\n00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.840\nWhat you wanna do is just move it over,\nthat's the easier way to say it.\n\n321\n00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.330\nThere you go, look at the lines,\nthat's how we know it's lined up.\n\n322\n00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.890\nI could say, okay, those things are lined\nup so I know they're exactly the same.\n\n323\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.290\nAnd then I might move this guy over here.\n\n324\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.870\nUnfortunately, I can't tell when\nit's the same size as the other\n\n325\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.170\nimages that are there.\n\n326\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.900\nI would love that, that's one of\nthe places where Smart Guides falls down.\n\n327\n00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.310\nIt doesn't tell me it's the same\nwidth as the guy in the upper left,\n\n328\n00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.330\nthat would be great.\n\n329\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.390\nSo I'm gonna eyeball that.\n\n330\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.010\nSo great, but because I have Auto-Fit on,\n\n331\n00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:48.040\nit keeps changing the fitting of\nthat picture inside that frame.\n\n332\n00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.232\nSo that's the Gap Tool.\n\n333\n00:15:49.232 --> 00:15:52.418\nI love the Gap Tool because I can\neasily lay out grids of images.\n\n334\n00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:56.106\nSo if you're doing like a montage like I\nused to do Prom books a long long time\n\n335\n00:15:56.106 --> 00:15:59.387\nago and I would lay them out originally\nby hand but then I start doing\n\n336\n00:15:59.387 --> 00:16:02.930\nit on a computer but even so just\ntrying to come up with different grids.\n\n337\n00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.590\nEverything had to be a nice grid but\n\n338\n00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.640\nyou just wanna make it a little\ndifferent now and then.\n\n339\n00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.740\nThis would have come in so handy.\n\n340\n00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.960\nWe can do the same here, and we just say,\nokay, let's make these bottom ones.\n\n341\n00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.030\nWhoops, let's not hold down the Shift key,\nlet's take the whole gap and\n\n342\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.140\nshrink those up.\n\n343\n00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.310\nSo it's really a quick way to lay\nout a grid super easy of images.\n\n344\n00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.090\nAnd again,\nthey don't have to have images in it.\n\n345\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.470\nThat just really showcases\nwhere the grid comes in handy.\n\n346\n00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.100\nYou could do it with\njust individual objects.\n\n347\n00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.330\nAs well.\n\n348\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.350\nSo the gridify secret menu and\nthe gap changing this.\n\n349\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.380\nAnd you don't have to use\nthe Gap tool only when you've\n\n350\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.630\nused the gridify to do it.\n\n351\n00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.960\nCould be that you laid it out completely\nby hand, it automatically finds the gap\n\n352\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.830\nfor you no matter how you\ncreated those items on the page.\n\n353\n00:16:43.132 --> 00:16:46.240\nAll right so we've got images on the page,\nwe've got links.\n\n354\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.870\nI know I gave you a slight preview\nin a previous episode of what\n\n355\n00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.390\nthe links looked like but let's actually\ntake a look at the Links panel.\n\n356\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.730\nSo the Links panel is\na place where we have\n\n357\n00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.990\neverything that we put inside our\ndocument is here in the Links panel.\n\n358\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.300\nNow when we place an image inside\nhere it doesn't actually put the full\n\n359\n00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.040\nimage in there.\n\n360\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.540\nIt puts a low resolution, a placeholder.\n\n361\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.400\nA little bookmark, if you will.\n\n362\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.900\nSo, I put this image here but\nthe image itself is not in in-design.\n\n363\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.700\nBut it does tell me it's Venice1.jpeg and\nit even,\n\n364\n00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.850\nwhen I roll over it,\nshows me where that lives.\n\n365\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:23.310\nAnd if you move it it expects to see it\nwhere it was and you'll get missing images\n\n366\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.520\nwhich is why we dipped into\nthe Links panel earlier anyway.\n\n367\n00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.740\nSo I can see that I have this image here\nand I can see that there's nothing wrong\n\n368\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.240\nwith it because in this little column\nthere's no little stop sign or yield sign\n\n369\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.550\nwhich says there's either something\nwrong or it's completely missing.\n\n370\n00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.490\nSo I can see, okay, all my links are good.\n\n371\n00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.700\nIt means when I placed them,\nit knew where it was.\n\n372\n00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.720\nThat's what this path is.\n\n373\n00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.680\nIt says this is where it was.\n\n374\n00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.560\nAnd they haven't moved.\n\n375\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.610\nIf you move where that sits on the hard\ndrive, you will get a missing or\n\n376\n00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.150\na modified icon depending.\n\n377\n00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.140\nIf I go into Photoshop and\n\n378\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.770\nmake change to it, it will now tell\nme this image has been modified.\n\n379\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:00.960\nAnd you need to update it.\n\n380\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.650\nOther things that are in the panel and\nwe'll jump in a second,\n\n381\n00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.000\nwe'll make some changes in Photoshop and\nthen bring it back into InDesign and show\n\n382\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.870\nyou how easy that is to update those but\ncouple of other things in the Links panel.\n\n383\n00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.520\nThere are tons of things\nin the Links panel,\n\n384\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.840\nwe'll just go over a couple of them.\n\n385\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.700\nDon't wanna get too too bummed down\nwith a lot of the stuff that's in there.\n\n386\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.905\nUnder the Panel menu, so\n\n387\n00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:24.620\nI'm in the Links panel, if it's not open\nremember to go to Window > Choose Links.\n\n388\n00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.040\nIf it's not in your layout,\nyour workspace,\n\n389\n00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.610\nI can come in here to the Panel menu and\nI can choose Panel Options and\n\n390\n00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.220\nthis is where I tell it\nwhat information is here.\n\n391\n00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.140\nSo am gonna keep everything as it is.\n\n392\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.850\nI just want to show you that\nyou can customize that.\n\n393\n00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.360\nIf there are things you don't need,\nturn them off.\n\n394\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.180\nBut what it says at the top is it says\nit's going to show you the name of\n\n395\n00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.970\nthe file,\nit's going to show you what page it's on.\n\n396\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:44.880\nThese are hyperlinks.\n\n397\n00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.910\nThe great thing is if I have other pages,\nI'm just gonna add another page,\n\n398\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.600\nwe're on page two.\n\n399\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.350\nAnd I think which one is Venice three,\nwhere does that live.\n\n400\n00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.240\nI can click on that little page hyperlink\nand it automatically jumps not only\n\n401\n00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.240\nto the page but\nto the image itself and it selects it.\n\n402\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.550\nIt's kinda hard to see which one it\nis because it's such a big image\n\n403\n00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.990\nbecause it shrunk it down and\nI'm only grabbing a small portion of it.\n\n404\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.760\nBut I can see it's this image\nhere that actually takes up\n\n405\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.160\nall that space that's there.\n\n406\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.050\nBut it jumps right to it so I can find it.\n\n407\n00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.310\nSo it's an easy way to find\nwhat's in your document.\n\n408\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.870\nOr if you can't remember what a document\nis called, one of the assets is called\n\n409\n00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.590\nI can click on it and it highlights\nit in the Links panel for me as well.\n\n410\n00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.540\nThe other things in the Links\npanel are down at the bottom.\n\n411\n00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.320\nI'm actually gonna move\nthis up a little bit.\n\n412\n00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.850\nI can grab one of these handles here,\nmaybe.\n\n413\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.060\nLet's grab this guy up, and we'll just\nshorten it up so we can see the bottom.\n\n414\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.600\nI'm gonna just rip this off\na little bit so I can float it and\n\n415\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.040\nit's a little bit easier to see.\n\n416\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.070\nTells me what the name of the file is,\nthat's important.\n\n417\n00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.500\nThe format might be important,\nmight not be.\n\n418\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.960\nTells me what color space its in.\n\n419\n00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.020\nIn the future episode we're gonna\ntalk about color space, RGB and CMYK.\n\n420\n00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.160\nSo for now, just know that you can see\nthe information that you need here.\n\n421\n00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.200\nStatus is okay, it has not been updated or\nmoved so it's good and\n\n422\n00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.600\nthe other thing we wanna look at is really\njust two other things that are super\n\n423\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.880\nimportant are the actual and\nthe effective PPI or the pixels per inch.\n\n424\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.540\nIf you've worked in printing, you might\nknow the term DPI, that's dots per inch.\n\n425\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.240\nThat's because when you print,\nyou work in dots or in pixels.\n\n426\n00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.760\nTechnically, they're not the same, but\nfor InDesign's sake, they are the same.\n\n427\n00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.730\nSo if we know that we need 300, we're\ngonna talk about resolution when we get to\n\n428\n00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.072\noutput, just so you know that's coming.\n\n429\n00:20:18.072 --> 00:20:21.360\nBut 300 is kind of this magic number\nif you know it's going to print\n\n430\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.960\npeople often think it has to be\nat least 300 pixels per inch.\n\n431\n00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.870\nWell, what this tells me is that the file,\n\n432\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.560\nwhen it was created,\nwas 300 pixels per inch.\n\n433\n00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.710\nBut the effective, the actual amount\nof resolution we're getting is 510.\n\n434\n00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:41.280\nAnd that's because when I placed it to\nfit it into that frame I made it smaller.\n\n435\n00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.690\nSo Erica, you made it smaller but\nthe numbers got bigger?\n\n436\n00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:44.350\nYes.\n\n437\n00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.250\nBecause you can't add resolution.\n\n438\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:50.550\nIf I've got a 300 pixel\nper inch document or\n\n439\n00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:55.900\nPhotoshop file and I make it smaller\nin InDesign I've gained resolution but\n\n440\n00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.515\nI can't just magically keep it at 100% and\nthen say make it 600 DPI.\n\n441\n00:21:00.515 --> 00:21:04.190\nNow unfortunately Photoshop will\nlet you type in those numbers and\n\n442\n00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.750\nit will try to figure out what 600\nwould be but it's not accurate and\n\n443\n00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.830\nit's never pretty don't do that,\nbut people do it all the time.\n\n444\n00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:11.610\nDon't do that.\n\n445\n00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.400\nSo basically I want to make sure that\nit's as high as I need it to and\n\n446\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.830\nwhen we get into output we'll talk about\nwhat we need for each output device.\n\n447\n00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:22.760\nBut if I were going to print, and my\nprinter, my printshop told me your images\n\n448\n00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.630\nneed to be 300 PPI or DPI then I\nneed to make sure that my effective\n\n449\n00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:32.870\nPPI in the links panel Is at least 300 for\neach of those, and it is,\n\n450\n00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:37.280\nif I place that 300 PPI really big,\nand I stretched it and\n\n451\n00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.780\nput it at 300% on my page,\nI'm going to lose a third I think,\n\n452\n00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.220\nor two-thirds, and see there's that math\nagain, I'm going to lose resolution.\n\n453\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.530\nSo basically if I placed it really large,\nmy resolution would go down\n\n454\n00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.580\nbecause you're still kind of cramming that\nsame amount of pixels into that space.\n\n455\n00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.430\nWe don't have time to go into all\nthe reasons why, but keep in mind this is\n\n456\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.090\nwhere you check to make sure your\nresolution is what you need for\n\n457\n00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.310\nyour end piece.\n\n458\n00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.060\nSo I can go through each one and\ncheck that.\n\n459\n00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.390\nWe 're going to look in\noutput how to check it and\n\n460\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.140\nnot have to go through\neach one individually.\n\n461\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.864\nBut know that that information is\nthere in the Links Panel for you.\n\n462\n00:22:09.864 --> 00:22:11.472\nSo that's something that\nyou wanna keep in mind.\n\n463\n00:22:11.472 --> 00:22:16.730\nFor instance, this image is only 72\nwhich that's really low resolution but\n\n464\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.596\nmy effective is 482.\n\n465\n00:22:17.596 --> 00:22:21.910\nAnd that's because when I look at this\nimage and click on this image inside, and\n\n466\n00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.330\nactually on the image,\nI can see that my percentage,\n\n467\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:30.420\nit's only 15% of size, it got shrunk\ndown so much that I gained resolution.\n\n468\n00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.780\nSo again, that's the Links panel for\nkeeping track of that.\n\n469\n00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.340\nNow, the Links panel tells InDesign where\nthese links lived when you placed them.\n\n470\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.710\nIf I move them, like I said,\nthey will end up somewhere else.\n\n471\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.950\nSo I can actually look and\nsee where this item is, or\n\n472\n00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.950\nI can relink it to something else.\n\n473\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.860\nLet's actually click on this document\nhere, and I'm going to relink it.\n\n474\n00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.900\nVenice one, I decided I don't like\nthat picture, so let's relink it.\n\n475\n00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.430\nI'm going to click Relink and\nI'm going to choose one of the other ones.\n\n476\n00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.690\nLet's choose one of\nthe ones in Merano instead.\n\n477\n00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.890\nWe'll say okay.\n\n478\n00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.360\nIt takes that image.\n\n479\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.210\nAnd it replaced it.\n\n480\n00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.370\nNow it kept it at the same\npercentage which may or\n\n481\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.960\nmay not work with this particular picture,\nso I may have to move that around a bit.\n\n482\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.960\nYou notice it did not honor the fitting.\n\n483\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.450\nAnd doesn't do that when you relink it,\n\n484\n00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.700\nautomatically brings in\nthe same percentage.\n\n485\n00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.730\nWhich might not fit exactly the same.\n\n486\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:21.450\nYou can always rerun the fitting, object\nfitting and fill frame proportionally.\n\n487\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.280\nSo always rerun that and\nsee how that works.\n\n488\n00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.960\nMake changes to it as we need.\n\n489\n00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.712\nBut we can use the links\npanel to manage all that.\n\n490\n00:23:27.712 --> 00:23:30.790\nAll right so one of the other things that\nyou can see in the Links panel is you can\n\n491\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.900\nsee when a file is missing or\nhas been modified.\n\n492\n00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.550\nSo I'm gonna take this one that we're\nworking with Verona 5 here, and\n\n493\n00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.130\nI am going to move it somewhere else.\n\n494\n00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:42.220\nI am gonna jump out to the desktop,\nand where it's sitting is here.\n\n495\n00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.720\nIf I grab the right one, let's hope, but\n\n496\n00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.760\nI am gonna actually just\nmove this out of the way.\n\n497\n00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.986\nSo, I am just moving it out of that\nfolder, and now when I jump back into\n\n498\n00:23:48.986 --> 00:23:52.545\nInDesign, it tells me it's missing,\nbecause it doesn't know where it is,\n\n499\n00:23:52.545 --> 00:23:56.090\nbecause it's expecting it to be where\nit was when I placed it in my document.\n\n500\n00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.147\nAlso, if I make a change to that image,\nlet's actually go back to my desktop,\n\n501\n00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:01.566\nand I'm going to say Undo.\n\n502\n00:24:01.566 --> 00:24:03.675\nWhen I undo that it's going\nto put it back where it was.\n\n503\n00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:06.418\nBut what I wanna do is\nopen this up in Photoshop.\n\n504\n00:24:06.418 --> 00:24:09.600\nAnd I'm actually gonna\nmake a change to that.\n\n505\n00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.140\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nmake a change.\n\n506\n00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.960\nWe'll just, I don't know,\ndo something to it.\n\n507\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.210\nI will just draw something\non it just to make it easy,\n\n508\n00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.690\njust with a paint brush or something.\n\n509\n00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.610\nI'll just make that beautiful,\nbeautiful thing, and I'm gonna say save.\n\n510\n00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.200\nNow I'm gonna forget that next time\nI open that, and I'm gonna freak out,\n\n511\n00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.200\nwhat is that on my image here?\n\n512\n00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.500\nI'm gonna come back to InDesign.\n\n513\n00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.310\nAnd now when I do it, it says,\nhey, you've made a change to that.\n\n514\n00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.880\nSo I need to fix that.\n\n515\n00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.540\nSo if I go back out to Photoshop,\nlet's try undo.\n\n516\n00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.710\nIt won't step backwards,\nlook at that, even though I saved it,\n\n517\n00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.220\nit let's me step backwards.\n\n518\n00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.340\nSo I'm gonna do that and hit save.\n\n519\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:45.030\nWhen I go back to InDesign it still says\nthat it's been changed, why is that?\n\n520\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.620\nWell it doesn't know that I've changed it,\nor that I've updated it again and\n\n521\n00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.610\nthen put it back.\n\n522\n00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.520\nSo I can actually double click on that,\nand\n\n523\n00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.800\nnow it will bring in that new image and\nput that in there.\n\n524\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.730\nBut there's an easier way to do that.\n\n525\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:59.810\nI can start the change in InDesign instead\nof going out to Photoshop making a change\n\n526\n00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.310\nand getting that alert.\n\n527\n00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.900\nIf I start in InDesign and\nsay hey make a change from here,\n\n528\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.290\nI can do what's called the round trip.\n\n529\n00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.260\nI can go out of Photoshop,\nmake the change and bring it back in.\n\n530\n00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:08.790\nSo let's do that.\n\n531\n00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.950\nI'm gonna select the image in InDesign\nin a right click or control click and\n\n532\n00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.610\ncome down to Edit With.\n\n533\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.100\nAnd I can choose Edit Original, but\n\n534\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.430\nif I do Edit Original, it automatically\nopens up that file type in\n\n535\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.530\nwhatever you have your system set\nup to open that file type in.\n\n536\n00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.255\nSo I have jpg JPEG's, it automatically\nwants to open it in preview,\n\n537\n00:25:25.255 --> 00:25:25.935\nwhich I don't want.\n\n538\n00:25:25.935 --> 00:25:27.005\nI wanna open it in Photoshop.\n\n539\n00:25:27.005 --> 00:25:28.705\nSo, I'm gonna choose edit width.\n\n540\n00:25:28.705 --> 00:25:30.375\nAnd then it says,\nwhat do you wanna edit with?\n\n541\n00:25:30.375 --> 00:25:32.425\nChoose the right version of Photoshop.\n\n542\n00:25:32.425 --> 00:25:35.640\nAnd so, because I start in InDesign,\nI'm gonna come in here.\n\n543\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.300\nSquiggly line across there and\ndeface that, and I'm gonna hit save.\n\n544\n00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.030\nI'm not gonna close it, but\nI'm just gonna hit Save.\n\n545\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:46.070\nI'm gonna jump back to InDesign and\nautomatically, there's my new image\n\n546\n00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.150\nalready updated with that image,\nbecause I started it here and went out.\n\n547\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.300\nSo now I can keep doing that,\nkeep going around.\n\n548\n00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.670\nAnd if I come back to Photoshop and\ndo Step Backwards, let's do that.\n\n549\n00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.530\nResave it,\n\n550\n00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:00.590\ncome back because I started in Photo Shop\nit says hey you need to update that.\n\n551\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.040\nSo just double click on that,\nand it updates it for you.\n\n552\n00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.940\nSo it's just a quick way to make sure\nyour links are always updated and\n\n553\n00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.880\nchanges are being reflected\nin your in design document.\n\n554\n00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.680\nAll right.\n\n555\n00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.440\nWe've relinked.\n\n556\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.460\nWe've brought things in linked to the same\nfile when something needs to be changed,\n\n557\n00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.730\nwe've also relink to new files,\nwhich is great like I said,\n\n558\n00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.300\nwe decide we hate this picture.\n\n559\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.930\nYou could relink to an entirely\nnew image that's in there.\n\n560\n00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.500\nOne last thing with images that I wanna\ntalk about in this episode is what's\n\n561\n00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.430\ncalled in line and anchored objects, and\nactually I have a document for that.\n\n562\n00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.140\nSo let's go out to the desktop, and\nI want to choose this one here,\n\n563\n00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.580\nAnchored Inline Objects, and\nI'm missing some objects, so\n\n564\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.870\nI do have to relink those,\nlet's do that as well.\n\n565\n00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.390\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect both those objects that are here,\n\n566\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.870\nand I'm gonna say relink and\nwe moved out of Italy,\n\n567\n00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.310\nwe're now working with\nAlice In Wonderland which.\n\n568\n00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.820\nWhich is great.\n\n569\n00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.610\nI'm gonna come in here.\n\n570\n00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.050\nAnd I'll re-link to the Drink Me one,\nwhich is here.\n\n571\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.420\nAnd I\"lll say Open.\n\n572\n00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.430\nAnd it automatically is going to say,\n\n573\n00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.210\nthere's also this other one\nthat you might want to do that.\n\n574\n00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.480\nLet's do the White Rabbit one.\n\n575\n00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.720\nWe say okay, and everything is updated.\n\n576\n00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.540\nSo I have nothing missing, and I know\nthat my graphics are all set for me.\n\n577\n00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.120\nSo what I want to do,\nI want to take this text and\n\n578\n00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.555\nI want to place this image along with\nthe text, so that when the text changes or\n\n579\n00:27:16.555 --> 00:27:20.615\nflows, moves up and down,\nthe image will move with it, and\n\n580\n00:27:20.615 --> 00:27:24.035\nthat's called an in-line graphic\nif it's inside the frame.\n\n581\n00:27:24.035 --> 00:27:27.155\nIt's called an anchored graphic\nif it's outside the frame.\n\n582\n00:27:27.155 --> 00:27:29.260\nSo let's look at that, how do we do that?\n\n583\n00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.090\nRight now I have a frame over here,\nand I have text over here.\n\n584\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.650\nNow we haven't worked a lot with text,\nbut we did do a frame and\n\n585\n00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.230\nwe filled it with placeholder\ntext in earlier episode.\n\n586\n00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.370\nSo let's pretend that's what we did.\n\n587\n00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:43.090\nJust happens to be that it actually\nmakes sense in this text here, but\n\n588\n00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.700\nI want to put that image inside.\n\n589\n00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.200\nSo maybe I want it to appear\nbefore this second paragraph.\n\n590\n00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.580\nAnd, as the text changes or moves, I\nchange the size of the frame, or I add or\n\n591\n00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.340\nsubtract text,\nI want that image to go with it.\n\n592\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.170\nSo, I create what's called an in-line,\nI'm sorry, yes, an in-line graphic.\n\n593\n00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:01.340\nSo I'm gonna come in here, and\nI'm going to just zoom in a little bit, so\n\n594\n00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.730\nwe can actually see a little bitter.\n\n595\n00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.830\nAnd, I'm gonna use this little\nblue square that's here, so\n\n596\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.950\nI said there's this big thing that's been\nsitting here, waiting for us to use this.\n\n597\n00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.790\nSo what I need to do for an inline one,\n\n598\n00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:17.930\ninline like it sits inside the text frame,\nI need to grab this item and\n\n599\n00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.340\nI'm gonna drag it to where I need\nto sit wherever my cursor is, and\n\n600\n00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.900\nI'm gonna hold down the shift key, that's\ngoing to force it inside the text frame.\n\n601\n00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.710\nWhen I let go of that, that image is\nnow sitting inside the text frame.\n\n602\n00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.800\nNow I have to hit an extra return here,\nbecause there wasn't any space.\n\n603\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.900\nI'm just gonna return, so there's a little\nbit of breathing room between that.\n\n604\n00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.060\nBut what happens to that if I make\nchanges to this text, I'm just gonna\n\n605\n00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.790\nadd some returns the image moves with it,\nso that's an inline graphic, and\n\n606\n00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.970\nit moves and says, as the text changes,\nthat image travels with it.\n\n607\n00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:53.040\nSo you can be sure that it's always\nsitting exactly where you want it to be.\n\n608\n00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.220\nSo I'm going to actually\njump to the next page.\n\n609\n00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.020\nAnd show you an anchored one.\n\n610\n00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.150\nMaybe I want it sitting\nout here off to the side.\n\n611\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.480\nBut I want it sitting, so it's attached\nto this second paragraph here,\n\n612\n00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.430\nthat starts with in another moment,\nbut I don't want it inside the frame.\n\n613\n00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.640\nI like where it's sitting off to the side.\n\n614\n00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.210\nBut, if the text moves down or\njumps to a whole new page,\n\n615\n00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.220\nI would like that image to travel\nto that next page as well.\n\n616\n00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.850\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n617\n00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:22.580\ndo sort of the same thing only I'm not\ngonna hold down the shift key this time.\n\n618\n00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.490\nI'm gonna select the frame\nthat the selection tool,\n\n619\n00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:29.070\nI'm gonna grab the little blue square,\nand I'm just gonna drag it in.\n\n620\n00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:34.240\nNow you notice as I roll over that little\nsquare it tells me exactly what I need.\n\n621\n00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.580\nIt says drag into text anchor the object,\nshift drag to make an in line.\n\n622\n00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.660\nSo just remember and\nthat line is inside the frame.\n\n623\n00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.200\nBut I'm gonna grab that and\njust drag it without doing shift, and\n\n624\n00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.230\nI'm gonna drop it right at the beginning.\n\n625\n00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.170\nNow, nothing looks like it changed.\n\n626\n00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.120\nSo it really kinda didn't except that,\n\n627\n00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.510\nthat little blue dot\nnow is a little anchor.\n\n628\n00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.520\nAnd that just tells me\nit's an anchored object.\n\n629\n00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.770\nThat means it's anchored,\n\n630\n00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.170\nnow I have to set up the settings\notherwise it just uses the default.\n\n631\n00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.140\nRight now it looks pretty good, but I'm\ngonna make some changes to it, but if this\n\n632\n00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:07.210\ntext changes, and I hit return that tag or\nthat image travels with the text.\n\n633\n00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.270\nSo it's anchored to that spot.\n\n634\n00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.490\nNow, where did it get anchored?\n\n635\n00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.730\nWell, that's when we need to go\nin the options and look at that.\n\n636\n00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:17.090\nSo I'm gonna use the Selection tool,\nI'm gonna come over here to the frame, and\n\n637\n00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:20.150\nI'm gonna Option or\nAlt-click on the little anchor.\n\n638\n00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:24.730\nAnd that brings up my options, so I have\ncustom, I have in line or above the line.\n\n639\n00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.790\nAnd actually that's what I do when I\njust shift dragged it in there, and\n\n640\n00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.480\nit was an in line.\n\n641\n00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.270\nIt would have said in line\nif I had gone in there.\n\n642\n00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:31.670\nBut we have fewer options to play with,\n\n643\n00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:35.410\nI'm gonna choose custom which\nis what it automatically did.\n\n644\n00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.840\nAnd I need to tell it how it knows where\nit's anchored, and what it's anchored too,\n\n645\n00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.180\nby fault it automatically put it\non what's called the baseline.\n\n646\n00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.470\nSo when I dragged that in there,\nit automatically took,\n\n647\n00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.160\nand now I have to see\nwhere it's anchored to.\n\n648\n00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.640\nBut it says take the bottom\nright part of that image, and\n\n649\n00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.700\nanchor it to the baseline on the X axis.\n\n650\n00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.830\nOn the y axis which is up and down, and\n\n651\n00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.090\nwe'll look at each of these in just\na second, but you think it didn't actually\n\n652\n00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:07.480\nanchor the bottom right it\nlooks like it's the top right.\n\n653\n00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:13.440\nWell I need to tell it how that\nrelates to that baseline that's there.\n\n654\n00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.330\nSo I'm going to come in here and\n\n655\n00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:19.360\nsay OK let's anchor the top right of\nthat image and let's turn on preview.\n\n656\n00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.240\nThe top right of that image.\n\n657\n00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.960\nAnd I want it to be to the baseline\nof where I dragged that into,\n\n658\n00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.100\nwhich was right at this in another frame.\n\n659\n00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.110\nWell, the thing is look at this.\n\n660\n00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.110\nI have an offset of almost three inches.\n\n661\n00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.280\nWell, I don't want that.\n\n662\n00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:31.960\nWhy is that there?\n\n663\n00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.470\nThat's just because I dragged it manually.\n\n664\n00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.480\nSo I'm gonna hit 0 and hit tab.\n\n665\n00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.860\nSo now it brings it up.\n\n666\n00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.660\nAnd, I guess I did it to this one here,\n\n667\n00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.220\nto the Rabbit Hole Dragged\nit to the wrong place.\n\n668\n00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.230\nBut I can tell it how I want\nit to sit in relation to that.\n\n669\n00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:50.330\nSo I've got on the x and y axis I've told\nit I want it to be to the text frame.\n\n670\n00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:51.800\nRight, so back and\n\n671\n00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.980\nforth the right side is anchored to the\ntext frame with an offset of .32 inches.\n\n672\n00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.610\nSo if I move that I can see\nhow far off I want that, but\n\n673\n00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:00.630\nmaybe that's not where I want it.\n\n674\n00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:06.160\nMaybe I want the Upper left hand\nto be anchored to the page margin.\n\n675\n00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.730\nSo I can have that sitting over\nthere in the page margin and\n\n676\n00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.580\nwith no offset whatsoever.\n\n677\n00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.600\nSo I can tell it where it sits.\n\n678\n00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.440\nI can do the page margin here as well.\n\n679\n00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:19.920\nSo when I do that, I have the upper\nleft corner anchored to the page margin.\n\n680\n00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.900\nSo I can tell it where\nit sits on the page.\n\n681\n00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.772\nOne of the other options I\nhave is relative to spine, but\n\n682\n00:32:24.772 --> 00:32:28.360\nI can't select that,\nbecause it only knows it's the spine\n\n683\n00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.500\nif it's facing pages because\nof not working facing pages.\n\n684\n00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.020\nI don't have that option, so\n\n685\n00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:37.070\nwhittled is anchored with facing pages,\nand it is anchored in upper left.\n\n686\n00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.320\nWhen I have facing pages\nturned on relative to spine\n\n687\n00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.500\nit will say anchored to the upper left\non the left hand side of the page and\n\n688\n00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.380\nthe upper right on a right hand side page.\n\n689\n00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.690\nHopefully that makes sense.\n\n690\n00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.870\nThe other two things I can say is,\nprevent manual positioning,\n\n691\n00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:52.920\nwhich means I can't accidentally drag it,\nwhich is the whole point of anchoring it,\n\n692\n00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.690\nso it doesn't do that.\n\n693\n00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.680\nAnd then also keep within top and\nbottom boundaries.\n\n694\n00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:01.585\nIt means it won't ever go higher or\nlower than the text that it's anchored to.\n\n695\n00:33:01.585 --> 00:33:02.919\nSo there's a lot of options in there.\n\n696\n00:33:02.919 --> 00:33:05.795\nBut i just wanted to show you how\nyou could anchor that to that, so\n\n697\n00:33:05.795 --> 00:33:09.280\nthat as this text changes, that image\ntravels along with it by anchoring it.\n\n698\n00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.860\nSo you can put it on the page\nwhere you want it, and\n\n699\n00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.470\nsay anchor and\nit automatically does the magic for you.\n\n700\n00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:14.750\nIt's just automatically there.\n\n701\n00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:19.130\nSo it's a quick way to get anchored images\nin line, they live inside the frame.\n\n702\n00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.080\n>> Well, we've appreciated it Erica,\nthank you for showing us that.\n\n703\n00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.510\nAnd I tell you,\nthat Gridify that you mentioned, now we're\n\n704\n00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:28.170\nseeing something under the hood that maybe\neven the help topics don't have access to.\n\n705\n00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:31.060\nIt does look like we're coming to the end\nof another episode, but before we do,\n\n706\n00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.920\ndo you have any additional words\nyou'd like to throw in here?\n\n707\n00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.730\n>> No, I think we've covered it all.\n\n708\n00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:35.580\n>> All right, very good.\n\n709\n00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.050\nThank you for\njoining us in the studios, and\n\n710\n00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.690\nwe appreciate you, the viewer, watching.\n\n711\n00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.366\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n712\n00:33:41.366

00:00:18.998\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through\n\n4\n00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:21.910\nour series in\nthe Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.040\nAnd we're focusing in on End Design.\n\n6\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.460\nAnd joining me back in the studios\ntoday is none other than Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.100\nErica, how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.310\n>> I'm doing great, Wes, thanks.\n\n9\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.590\n>> Great.\nWelcome back in the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.918\nWhat are we going to be looking at today?\n\n11\n00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:34.240\n>> Today we are going to\nstart out looking at effects.\n\n12\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.620\nSo we're just going to see some of\nthe cool effects that we can create\n\n13\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.680\nin End Design and\nadd to things we put in there.\n\n14\n00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.440\nSo, the first thing that we're going to\nlook at is something called Clipping Path.\n\n15\n00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.020\nNow, if you're working in Photoshop\nyou're used to probably creating paths.\n\n16\n00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.130\nAnd we can actually use those in\nInDesign to create a clipping.\n\n17\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.150\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and jump over and\nshow you what a clipping path is.\n\n18\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.180\nIt's easier to show you than to tell you.\n\n19\n00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.334\nAnd basically, I'm going to place\nan item inside photo, in this case.\n\n20\n00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:02.860\nAnd we're going to create a clipping path.\n\n21\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.170\nAnd a clipping path basically\nmakes a path around an object\n\n22\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.480\nthat you can now see what's\nbehind through that.\n\n23\n00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.370\nSo for instance, think of if\nyou've ever used PowerPoint and\n\n24\n00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.390\nyou take something that looks transparent.\n\n25\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.550\nIt's sitting on a white background,\nyou think that looks great and you\n\n26\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.440\nput it on top of something else and you've\ngot that big white square back behind it.\n\n27\n00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.430\nWell a clipping path gets rid of that.\n\n28\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.370\nSo if you've created a path in Photoshop,\nInDesign can access that and\n\n29\n00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.200\nsay just take that bit of\nthe path that we drew and\n\n30\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200\njust that part of the image that's\ninside that path will show.\n\n31\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.510\nBut InDesign also has a way to create\nits own clipping path if there isn't one\n\n32\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.790\nalready available in there.\n\n33\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.080\nSo on certain Files, and\nwe'll see what that looks like.\n\n34\n00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.610\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do is,\nI'm just gonna put a nice\n\n35\n00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.440\ncolor square in the background here,\nand I'm just gonna put color in it.\n\n36\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.240\nWe're gonna get to colors in\na later episode, very soon.\n\n37\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.518\nAnd so we'll come in here and\n\n38\n00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:56.730\nI'm just gonna give it a nice\nbright orange background.\n\n39\n00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.520\nSo I'm gonna do that, I just wanted\nsomething for it to sit on, so when we put\n\n40\n00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.740\nsomething on top of it, we can see that\nthe color does or doesn't show through it.\n\n41\n00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.959\nI'm going to bring in an image.\n\n42\n00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.642\nI'm going to do command or\ncontrol D to do that.\n\n43\n00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:11.359\nSo I'm going to do command or\ncontrol D to place, and\n\n44\n00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.930\nI'm going to come out here and\nlet's grab one of my images here.\n\n45\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.060\nAnd gonna use this guy.\n\n46\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.200\nThis guy has a white background, and\nI know that because I named it so\n\n47\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.700\nit says white on the background.\n\n48\n00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.230\nCuz, sometimes it's hard to tell\nfrom the preview, whether or\n\n49\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.240\nnot it's transparent, or\nwhite so, we need to know that.\n\n50\n00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.460\nSo in this case, I'm just gonna\nplop this image right down here.\n\n51\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.052\nNow, I don't wanna roll over this image,\nbecause if I do, If you saw a prior\n\n52\n00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:39.702\nepisode where we did placing images,\nit automatically when I go to place this\n\n53\n00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:43.036\nitem, when I roll over it, it thinks\nI want to place it into that item.\n\n54\n00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:43.765\nAnd that's not what I want.\n\n55\n00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:45.528\nI want two separate objects here.\n\n56\n00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:48.665\nSo I'm just going to place it off to\nthe side a little bit so it clicks in.\n\n57\n00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:49.721\nNow when I do that,\n\n58\n00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:53.425\nI zoom back out, you can see that\nthis has a white background to it.\n\n59\n00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:56.813\nI'm just going to shrink it down a little\nbit and zoom in a little bit more so\n\n60\n00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:57.588\nwe can see that.\n\n61\n00:02:57.588 --> 00:02:59.540\nAnd there's this big white\nbackground in the background.\n\n62\n00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.480\nThat's not what I wanted.\n\n63\n00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.490\nI wanted that photo sitting\non top of that file.\n\n64\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.290\nIn fact, I'm gonna change the color of\nthis, cuz I didn't realize there was so\n\n65\n00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.060\nmuch orange inside my flower here.\n\n66\n00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.970\nSo let's just change that color ever so\nslightly to something else, like yellow,\n\n67\n00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.320\njust so it's a little more\nobvious when we do this.\n\n68\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.300\nSo what I need to do is I need to\ncreate a path around this flower.\n\n69\n00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.610\nNow I may or may not have a Photoshop\npath that I can grab with that.\n\n70\n00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.430\nSo we'll look at that to see if we do or\nnot.\n\n71\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.628\nAnd if not, if it's sitting on a stark\nbackground, like a white background, or\n\n72\n00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:30.283\neven if it's a light object\non a black background,\n\n73\n00:03:30.283 --> 00:03:34.589\nInDesign is able to find the edges of that\ngraphic and actually cut out from there.\n\n74\n00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.270\nAnd we'll see that clipping path\nis not just to show through.\n\n75\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.010\nWe're gonna add some other effects to\nit as well that putting a clipping path\n\n76\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.250\naround something first gives us\nmore options with other effects.\n\n77\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.220\nSo I'm going to go ahead and select\nthe image, so I want to make sure I hit\n\n78\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.810\nthe little content grabber, the little\ntranslucent bagel in the middle here.\n\n79\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.670\nSo that I'm actually working\nwith the image itself and\n\n80\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.590\nI'm going to go up to the object menu.\n\n81\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.290\nAnd under the object menu I'm gonna come\ndown to clipping path and click options.\n\n82\n00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.590\nMove this off to the side.\n\n83\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.500\nNow most of the effects that we have,\n\n84\n00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.280\nwe have a little preview button and\nwe turn that on we can actually see as we\n\n85\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.250\napply the effects we can actually\nsee the effects coming into play.\n\n86\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.340\nSo we know that what we're doing is\nright instead of having to go through\n\n87\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.980\neverything, clicking OK and\nfinding out we did it wrong.\n\n88\n00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.880\nSo I'm gonna come over here\nto the type of path and\n\n89\n00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.290\nI have a couple different options in\nthis one of them is Detect Edges.\n\n90\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.800\nWe're gonna do that in just a minute.\n\n91\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.570\nBut right now, I have something, whoops,\nI only have this one called Detect Edges.\n\n92\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.490\nThat's right.\nThis one only has the white background.\n\n93\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.616\nIf I had a Photoshop path to it, which I\ndo in another one, looks exactly the same\n\n94\n00:04:33.616 --> 00:04:37.760\nbut it has a path already applied to it,\nI could choose the Photoshop path here.\n\n95\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.310\nBut in this case I'm just\ngonna choose detect edges.\n\n96\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.770\nSo when I do that, there's the whole\nbackground just went away.\n\n97\n00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.870\nNow we're gonna look at it a little closer\nin a second and see that it's not perfect.\n\n98\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.470\nDoing a path in Photoshop where you've\nactually drawn it with either the magic\n\n99\n00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.410\nwand or the pen tool,\nyou can be very, very precise.\n\n100\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.740\nSo what InDesign did is it said,\nI can see where this white background is.\n\n101\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.524\nAnd it got rid of it.\n\n102\n00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:01.366\nAnd we'll look at it, like say in\njust a second, we'll blow it up and\n\n103\n00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:03.390\nlook at how accurate is or isn't.\n\n104\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.240\nBut we can play with the threshold and\nthe tolerance.\n\n105\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.810\nI tend to leave those pretty\nmuch set as they are.\n\n106\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.200\nBut you can always play with that and see\nwhat kind of different of effects you get.\n\n107\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.740\nSo as I do that,\nthat is not what we're looking for.\n\n108\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.900\nSee how we don't wanna play with\nthat too much, obviously, but\n\n109\n00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.490\nwe can slide to a little bit to\nget a little bit more accurate.\n\n110\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.050\nWhat I tend to play with is\nthings like this inset frame, and\n\n111\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.510\nthat just tells me how much, so\nit'll find the edges and detect it, but\n\n112\n00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.950\nI can inset it so\nthat the path moves in ever so slightly.\n\n113\n00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.127\nAnd this is where using something\nother than inches comes in really,\n\n114\n00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:35.322\nreally handy cuz sometimes we just\nwant a really really tiny amount.\n\n115\n00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:39.417\nSo if I do that I might just put in\nlike let's say one or even half, so\n\n116\n00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:41.992\nlets do half of a millimeter so 0.5mm.\n\n117\n00:05:41.992 --> 00:05:43.575\nWhen I hit Tab, watch the path.\n\n118\n00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:45.425\nAnd it will just sort of\nshrink in a little bit so\n\n119\n00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:48.035\nyou kind of get some of\nthat white around it.\n\n120\n00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:48.885\nSo it just moved it in a little.\n\n121\n00:05:48.885 --> 00:05:52.185\nAnd that's actually probably too much,\nbecause now it's sort of smooth.\n\n122\n00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.870\nI really don't see the edge of\nthe flower that I had before.\n\n123\n00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.370\nSo I'll go ahead and\nput that back to 0 and\n\n124\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.023\njust leave it as it is cuz I wanna see\nhow accurate it turned out just natively.\n\n125\n00:06:02.023 --> 00:06:03.660\nI can also invert it.\n\n126\n00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.934\nSo I can click Invert and so everything\nexcept that part that's there will show.\n\n127\n00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.513\nAnd that's where invert or\nthe inset frame comes in handy\n\n128\n00:06:10.513 --> 00:06:13.196\nthis way as well because then I\ncan bring it out a little bit so\n\n129\n00:06:13.196 --> 00:06:16.170\nthat I don't get the edges in\nthe flowers that I'm showing here.\n\n130\n00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.200\nI can also include inside edges because\nwhat I can see right now is that\n\n131\n00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.540\nI don't really want this punched out,\nthis white that's here, but\n\n132\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.110\nmaybe that was something where it\nwasn't actually the pedal itself, and\n\n133\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.460\nI actually wanted to be\nable to see through it.\n\n134\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.535\nIf there's white spots that should be\npopped out, or punched out as well.\n\n135\n00:06:35.535 --> 00:06:37.340\nI can say include inside edges.\n\n136\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.910\nNow, you can kinda see, hopefully, let me\nzoom in a little bit, it punched that out.\n\n137\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.780\nThat's not really what I wanted,\n\n138\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.630\nbecause it was actually just\nthe white part of the flower,\n\n139\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.960\nbut if it were say a place\nwhere the leaf overlapped or\n\n140\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.310\nsomething, I can also do include\ninside edges to pop that out.\n\n141\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.460\nI can also restrict it to frame if I have\nthis image that's hanging outside of\n\n142\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.490\nthe frame, maybe I cropped it and\nonly part of the flower was showing.\n\n143\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.670\nLet's say only a small portion of it\nwas showing, but it's a large image.\n\n144\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.200\nIf I do the whole clipping path\nit's gonna draw everything,\n\n145\n00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.030\neven that sits outside the frame.\n\n146\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.380\nBut maybe that's a lot of points\nthat it has to remember, so\n\n147\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.200\nevery time you move it it has\nto redraw all those points.\n\n148\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.270\nSo sometimes you can click that so that\nit's only drawing the path on the part\n\n149\n00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.100\nInside the frame and where it gets to the\nedge of the frame will be a hard corner.\n\n150\n00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.910\nHowever, if you gonna move\nthe image inside the frame\n\n151\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.110\nyou don't have the whole clipping\npath around the whole object.\n\n152\n00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.831\nSo it's kinda of a trade off which is more\nimportant to you, and use high resolution\n\n153\n00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:33.880\nimage I would never use anything less than\nthat I wanted be as accurate as I can.\n\n154\n00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.630\nSo i'm just gonna leave\nit like that say OK and\n\n155\n00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.209\nthen we are gonna actually look at that.\n\n156\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.560\nAnd, I can see that it's not\nexactly perfect, it's sort of,\n\n157\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.450\nit said detect edges, but\nit made these kind of hard edges.\n\n158\n00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.290\nIt didn't follow the contour\nof the flower very much.\n\n159\n00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.850\nWell the great thing is the clipping\npath is actually an editable frame.\n\n160\n00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.886\nSo if I click on this with\nthe Direct Selection tool,\n\n161\n00:07:55.886 --> 00:07:58.377\nI suddenly have all\nthe points to the path.\n\n162\n00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:01.457\nSo if you saw previous episodes where\nI talked about paths and points and\n\n163\n00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:02.182\ncreating that.\n\n164\n00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:04.257\nThat's as if I drew it with the Pen tool.\n\n165\n00:08:04.257 --> 00:08:06.061\nIn fact, I can now use the Pen tool.\n\n166\n00:08:06.061 --> 00:08:10.534\nOr my direct selection tool to actually\nmanipulate the paths that are there.\n\n167\n00:08:10.534 --> 00:08:14.147\nSo for instance,\nI can with the direct selection tool and\n\n168\n00:08:14.147 --> 00:08:16.655\nI can click on this path and\nactually edit it.\n\n169\n00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:17.869\nI can play with these points.\n\n170\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:19.860\nPlay with the handles,\n\n171\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.430\nI can bring that in a little bit if I\ndidn't like how much white is showing.\n\n172\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.690\nSo I can bring that in.\n\n173\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.440\nIt's a lot of work manually.\n\n174\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.983\nFor something,\nif you've got to make a lot of changes,\n\n175\n00:08:28.983 --> 00:08:31.637\neven if you didn't have a path\nto start with in Photoshop,\n\n176\n00:08:31.637 --> 00:08:34.723\nthis might be a great point to go out and\nPhotoshop and create a path,\n\n177\n00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:38.158\nespecially because the whole detect\nedges that we're doing in InDesign.\n\n178\n00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:42.011\nYou can do a lot more smoothly in\nPhotoshop using the magic wand tool and\n\n179\n00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:43.260\nthen creating a path.\n\n180\n00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.620\nBut if you just want something quick, and\n\n181\n00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.740\nyou think, I need to just fix one\nlittle thing, maybe this is wrong.\n\n182\n00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.290\nI can start adding points,\nsubtracting points, whatever I need.\n\n183\n00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.260\nIn fact, I'm just going to undo and\ngo backwards until we get to where\n\n184\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.360\nwe don't have a clipping path and\nI'm gonna go back into the clipping path.\n\n185\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.070\nAnd I'm gonna tell it to go ahead and\ndetect edges, and\n\n186\n00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.577\nalso include those inside edges.\n\n187\n00:09:05.577 --> 00:09:07.100\nNow I can see where that got punched out.\n\n188\n00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.180\nMaybe I wanted this one punched out.\n\n189\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.680\nBut this one's also punched out and\nI didn't want that.\n\n190\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.070\nWell I can use the pen tool.\n\n191\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.880\nIn this case I'm gonna use the delete\nanchor point tool as part of\n\n192\n00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.180\nthe pen tool set.\n\n193\n00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.290\nAnd I'm gonna delete these\npoints that are here.\n\n194\n00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.620\nSo I'm gonna delete this, this,\nand I can just delete those.\n\n195\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.902\nBecause it is an editable path I can keep\ndeleting that until they're all gone and\n\n196\n00:09:26.902 --> 00:09:30.860\nthen I don't have that hole punched\nout of that particular segment.\n\n197\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.501\nSo we can actually clean up\nthose paths if we need to.\n\n198\n00:09:33.501 --> 00:09:36.897\nAnd again, it's one of those things that\nif you have to do a lot of work here, and\n\n199\n00:09:36.897 --> 00:09:40.041\nthen you change it, maybe you go and\nyou change the flower a little bit, or\n\n200\n00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:41.900\ndo something to it in Photoshop.\n\n201\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.110\nTo bring it back in, you might have\nto redo the same thing to the path.\n\n202\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.730\nSo either make sure it's something\nthat you're just plopping in here and\n\n203\n00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.570\nyou're gonna make changes to it really\nquickly, and not keep going back and\n\n204\n00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.580\nforth to Photoshop or maybe think about\ngoing to Photoshop to create the path.\n\n205\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.820\nSo let's look what that looks like when\nwe have one that is created in Photoshop.\n\n206\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.380\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and place this guy,\n\n207\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.500\nlet's do this guy, I think this\nguy has a flower, or has a path.\n\n208\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.830\nSo I'm placing him,\njust gonna place him here.\n\n209\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.256\nAgain, just off to the side a little bit\nand I have a path I believe around this\n\n210\n00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:15.176\nred flower, so\nI'm going to zoom in a little bit.\n\n211\n00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:17.160\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nselect this image.\n\n212\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.810\nGo up under the Object menu and\nclipping path, and choose options.\n\n213\n00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.065\nAnd this time I'm going to\nchoose Photoshop Path, and\n\n214\n00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:27.315\nthat's because I know that there's\na path that's drawn around this flower.\n\n215\n00:10:27.315 --> 00:10:31.004\nIt was drawn with the pen tool in\nPhotoshop, so when I do that what I have,\n\n216\n00:10:31.004 --> 00:10:33.760\nand actually I can see\nthat it's a lot cleaner.\n\n217\n00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.480\nLet's zoom in a little\nbit you can see that.\n\n218\n00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.228\nBut I can see that it's not nearly\nas chunky as the one that was\n\n219\n00:10:40.228 --> 00:10:41.917\ndone in InDesign is.\n\n220\n00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:42.850\nSo I can choose that.\n\n221\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.759\nI have all the same options to work\nwith also if there's an alpha channel,\n\n222\n00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:47.902\nI can do that as well.\n\n223\n00:10:47.902 --> 00:10:51.260\nI can work on transparency if there's\na transparency alpha channel for that.\n\n224\n00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.695\nI could still do detected edges but it\nwon't detect anything because it doesn't\n\n225\n00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:56.361\nhave any start contrast there at all and\n\n226\n00:10:56.361 --> 00:10:59.255\nonce I choose something whether\nit's Photoshop path or whatever.\n\n227\n00:10:59.255 --> 00:11:03.968\nWhen I go back into that object again,\nand back into the clipping path,\n\n228\n00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:06.400\nI now have user-modified path.\n\n229\n00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.660\nOnce I make changes to it,\nI can go ahead and modify it even further.\n\n230\n00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.650\nSo, same options, but you can see\nwe're having a path in Photoshop,\n\n231\n00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.940\nis really pretty handy.\n\n232\n00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.305\nSo, how does that help me?\n\n233\n00:11:17.305 --> 00:11:20.693\nWell, now I have this image that I can\nsit here and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n234\n00:11:20.693 --> 00:11:22.910\njust make it a little bit bigger.\n\n235\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.940\nSo I'm just gonna grab the frame.\n\n236\n00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.210\nI'm gonna size the frame\ndown a little bit.\n\n237\n00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.970\nI can also use my Fitting menu and say\nFit Frame to Content and shrink it down.\n\n238\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.540\nI just wanted to make\nthe frame a little tighter and\n\n239\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.840\nthen make the object a little bigger.\n\n240\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.200\nAnd we're gonna leave that for a second.\n\n241\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.480\nWe're gonna look at some other effects.\n\n242\n00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.810\nBut then, we're gonna come back to that\nand see why we would need a clipping path.\n\n243\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.270\nI'm gonna grab this yellow frame,\ngonna copy it.\n\n244\n00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.727\nI'm gonna create a new page,\nshift-command or shift-control-P,\n\n245\n00:11:48.727 --> 00:11:50.080\nand then I'm gonna paste that.\n\n246\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.210\nI'm actually gonna do another one,\n\n247\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.880\nanother paste option which\nis called Paste in Place.\n\n248\n00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.365\nSo under the edit menu paste in place or\nyou can hit all your modifier keys in v\n\n249\n00:11:57.365 --> 00:12:00.715\nand that will actually put in\nthe same exact spot on the page.\n\n250\n00:12:00.715 --> 00:12:02.985\nSo that's really handy if you wanna\nthings from one page to another.\n\n251\n00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:04.975\nIt will automatically\nput in the same place.\n\n252\n00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:07.790\nOtherwise, it just pastes it\njust wherever it wants to be.\n\n253\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:12.010\nSo I'm gonna place that in there, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and bring in this file.\n\n254\n00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.300\nNow it looks exactly the same one\nthat looks the same as that, but\n\n255\n00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.200\nyou notice there's a frame around it.\n\n256\n00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.120\nThat kind of lets us\nknow that that's a white,\n\n257\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.210\nsolid background,\nwhereas this is transparent.\n\n258\n00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.790\nAnd, I know that because I put\nthe transparency in there.\n\n259\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.080\nSo, in Photoshop,\nI have just the flower sitting there,\n\n260\n00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.650\nand it's on a transparent background.\n\n261\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.550\nInDesign understands transparency.\n\n262\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.664\nSo not only can it add transparency but\n\n263\n00:12:32.664 --> 00:12:35.844\nif it comes in with the file\nwe have transparency as well.\n\n264\n00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:38.252\nSo we're gonna bring that file in and\nI'm just gonna drop this in.\n\n265\n00:12:38.252 --> 00:12:38.995\nAnd you notice,\n\n266\n00:12:38.995 --> 00:12:42.400\nI didn't have to do a clipping path\nthat's because there is no background.\n\n267\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.980\nThere is a transparent\nbackground in Photoshop so\n\n268\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.270\nInDesign honors that when I bring that in.\n\n269\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.590\nSo if I had this to work with I can go\nfrom here and start doing the effects that\n\n270\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.340\nwe're gonna look at, or, in this case,\nbecause I had a white background,\n\n271\n00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.460\nI had to actually create the transparency\nby putting the clipping path in.\n\n272\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.110\nI didn't really create transparency,\nI knocked out everything else so\n\n273\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.740\nthat everything else can show through.\n\n274\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.720\nHopefully that makes sense.\n\n275\n00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.599\nSo, yeah, so whether or\nnot you create it in InDesign or\n\n276\n00:13:09.599 --> 00:13:13.930\nif you create it in Photoshop,\nthe transparency is there and usable.\n\n277\n00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.110\nSo, let's actually look\nat what that means,\n\n278\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.420\nI'm gonna look at this first one\nwhich is called the drop shadow.\n\n279\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.520\nEverybody kinda knows\nabout the drop shadow.\n\n280\n00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.399\nWhen InDesign first, InDesign version\n2 way back when, not CS2, before that,\n\n281\n00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:27.083\nthere is 1, 1.5 and 2.\n\n282\n00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:30.037\nWhen 2 came out it handled transparency\nand this was so amazing for\n\n283\n00:13:30.037 --> 00:13:33.362\nanybody that had been working in page\nlayout because until that point if you\n\n284\n00:13:33.362 --> 00:13:36.422\nwanted transparency on something you\nhad to go out to Photoshop to add\n\n285\n00:13:36.422 --> 00:13:39.459\nthe transparency and bring it in,\nand then it was still flattened.\n\n286\n00:13:39.459 --> 00:13:42.312\nYou still couldn't put it on anything\nbecause you still had that white\n\n287\n00:13:42.312 --> 00:13:44.246\nbackground but\nthe the transparent object, or\n\n288\n00:13:44.246 --> 00:13:46.729\nthe drop shadow was still on\nthat object and it looked great.\n\n289\n00:13:46.729 --> 00:13:50.290\nAnd so became this joke that everything\nhad to have drop shadows when we came in.\n\n290\n00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.850\nSo now I think people are trying\nto get away from that but\n\n291\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.340\nI still have the drop shadow, it still\ngives it a little bit of pop off the page.\n\n292\n00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.200\nSo that's basically what it is.\n\n293\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.740\nIt's not an actual shadow.\n\n294\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.950\nAn actual shadow looks obviously slightly\ndifferent but a drop shadow just means\n\n295\n00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.700\nit's the same object right back\nbehind it with a transparent.\n\n296\n00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.490\nThe fuzzy edges, you know,\nthat kind of look.\n\n297\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.130\nSo that's a drop shadow.\n\n298\n00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.810\nSo that's actually what we're gonna\ndo to these objects that are here.\n\n299\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.954\nAnd whether or not we did one with\na clipping path, so in this case,\n\n300\n00:14:15.954 --> 00:14:18.400\nthis one is the transparent one right?\n\n301\n00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.743\nAnd we've got the clipping\npath on this one.\n\n302\n00:14:20.743 --> 00:14:25.140\nBut it doesn't matter which one we use,\nI can go ahead and create a drop shadow.\n\n303\n00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.430\nWhen you are creating a drop shadow for\nan object, like a photo that's in a frame,\n\n304\n00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.580\nyou need to make sure you are adding\nthe drop shadow to the right thing.\n\n305\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.474\nIf I use my selection tool, my solid\ntool and I select on this frame and\n\n306\n00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:36.493\ndo a drop shadow.\n\n307\n00:14:36.493 --> 00:14:40.250\nI'm gonna get a drop shadow on my frame,\nthat's not what we want, we want to make\n\n308\n00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.818\nsure we are working with the image If I\nwant to drop shadow around that image.\n\n309\n00:14:43.818 --> 00:14:45.370\nAnd that's why I did that clipping path.\n\n310\n00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.780\nSo now it's gonna put it on the flower\ninstead of around the white box that was\n\n311\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.180\nback there before.\n\n312\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.410\nSo to get to the drop shadow, I'm gonna\ndo a drop shadow first on this yellow box\n\n313\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:56.770\njust so we can kinda see something simple\nand then we'll put it on the flower.\n\n314\n00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.792\nSo to get to the drop shadow and all\nthe different effects we're gonna talk.\n\n315\n00:14:59.792 --> 00:15:02.450\nThere's this little menu\nup here that says fx.\n\n316\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.350\nThere's also an effects menu\nover here under your window.\n\n317\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.060\nMenu, effects.\n\n318\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.000\nHere it's spelled with and E,\nhere it's spelled with an F.\n\n319\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.880\nSo, it just depends on\nhow you want to spell it.\n\n320\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.020\nI like FX, because it sounds\nlike cool stuff in a movie.\n\n321\n00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:14.890\nFX.\n\n322\n00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.010\nSo, I come in here and\nall my effects are listed here.\n\n323\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.273\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nchoose drop shadow.\n\n324\n00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:23.110\nAnd when I do that,\nI get my effects panel.\n\n325\n00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.930\nSo it doesnt matter which one you choose.\n\n326\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.100\nIt opens up the same panel except that the\none that you selected is actually checked.\n\n327\n00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.070\nAnd here's where it gets\na little confusing,\n\n328\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.830\nif I want to say apply something else\nlike satin nothing changed here.\n\n329\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.280\nI have to remember not\nonly to apply it but\n\n330\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.530\nI have to click on the one that I'm\nactually wanting to put parameters into.\n\n331\n00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.020\nSo I need to make sure I'm gonna turn\nthat back off and go back to drop shadow.\n\n332\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.150\nSo in the drop shadow, I'm going to\nturn on the preview so I can see it.\n\n333\n00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.920\nSo now it went ahead and added a drop\nshadow to that particular frame.\n\n334\n00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.720\nJust the frame itself.\n\n335\n00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.422\nSo we're going to come in here, I'm going\nto choose a color for the drop shadow.\n\n336\n00:15:58.422 --> 00:16:01.970\nSo by default it's set at black and\nI can click on that and\n\n337\n00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.368\neither colors that I have in\nmy color panel are there Or\n\n338\n00:16:05.368 --> 00:16:08.856\nI can mix colors if I want to,\nI can choose my swatches.\n\n339\n00:16:08.856 --> 00:16:11.190\nSo right now I'm just going\nto pick form my swatches.\n\n340\n00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.080\nI have a couple that are here we're\ngonna talk about, like say, Color and\n\n341\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.480\nSwatches in a future episode, but right\nnow I've got a few swatches that are here.\n\n342\n00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.760\nI have my Living in the 90s swatches.\n\n343\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.690\nAnd my welcome to the 70s swatches,\nso this is just my little\n\n344\n00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.150\node to the different colors of\nthe different decades that are out there.\n\n345\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.290\nI need an 80s one, but\nI already have teal so we'll see.\n\n346\n00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.014\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just choose one\nof these, I'll just make this the drop\n\n347\n00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:37.102\nshadow a dark green, cuz a darker\ncolor's gonna look better anyway.\n\n348\n00:16:37.102 --> 00:16:40.041\nSo actually, yeah,\nwe'll leave it at that, and I'll say OK.\n\n349\n00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:44.685\nAnd the opacity is how dark that shadow\nis, so I've got a little slider, or\n\n350\n00:16:44.685 --> 00:16:46.845\nyou can put it in a specific value.\n\n351\n00:16:46.845 --> 00:16:48.912\nSo I come in here just\nmake it darker whatever,\n\n352\n00:16:48.912 --> 00:16:50.561\nI'm just leave it about where it is.\n\n353\n00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:54.369\nAnd the blending mode, if you're familiar\nwith Photoshop, these blending modes will\n\n354\n00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:57.674\nlook completely familiar to you,\nthey're the same that are in Photoshop.\n\n355\n00:16:57.674 --> 00:16:59.644\nFor drop shadows, we tend to do multiply.\n\n356\n00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.940\nAnd we'll look at some of\nthe other blend modes in a second.\n\n357\n00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.990\nJust a couple of them to\nkind of give you an idea.\n\n358\n00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.680\nFor the most part, it can be\nunpredictable unless you're really,\n\n359\n00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.330\nreally good with color and know exactly\nhow your colors are gonna mix together.\n\n360\n00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.714\nFor me, once I get out of these first\ncouple of them, it's basically let's apply\n\n361\n00:17:14.714 --> 00:17:17.036\none and see what it looks like,\nmake sure it looks good.\n\n362\n00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.173\nI might even print it out or\n\n363\n00:17:18.173 --> 00:17:20.926\nexport it to PDF to see how it\nactually looks in the final piece.\n\n364\n00:17:20.926 --> 00:17:23.840\nBut for the most part, we're gonna\nstick with Multiply, definitely for\n\n365\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.590\ndrop shadows,\nwe're gonna stick with Multiply.\n\n366\n00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.140\nI can also tell it how\nfar out this shadow goes.\n\n367\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.307\nSo I'm just using the distance here.\n\n368\n00:17:30.307 --> 00:17:34.373\nYou notice as I change it here,\nit's also changing over here.\n\n369\n00:17:34.373 --> 00:17:36.820\nAnd that's because I can have\na different x and y axis.\n\n370\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.943\nI can have it sticking out\nfurther on one side if I want to.\n\n371\n00:17:38.943 --> 00:17:42.038\nBut right now I'm doing distance and\nthat's gonna put everything overall.\n\n372\n00:17:42.038 --> 00:17:43.954\nI also have the light source.\n\n373\n00:17:43.954 --> 00:17:48.689\nSo I can come in here and tell it where\nthe actual light source is coming from.By\n\n374\n00:17:48.689 --> 00:17:53.567\ndefault, it's set over here we have 120,\n135 I forgot what was that, but\n\n375\n00:17:53.567 --> 00:17:57.758\nI also tell use global light 120,\nit's gonna put back to 120.\n\n376\n00:17:57.758 --> 00:18:01.720\nIf I say use global light, I've set it\nat 120 and then said use global light.\n\n377\n00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.300\nEvery time I create a new effect,\nand I tell it use global light,\n\n378\n00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.120\nit's gonna set it at that same value.\n\n379\n00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.484\nSo if you've set it as something else and\nsaid use global light, that\n\n380\n00:18:10.484 --> 00:18:14.660\nbecomes the setting for all the effects in\nthis particular document, which is good,\n\n381\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.316\ncuz then you make sure you have the light\nsource coming from the same place.\n\n382\n00:18:18.316 --> 00:18:22.330\nI can also choose what size\nI want the shadow to be.\n\n383\n00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.100\nAs I make it larger,\nyou notice it gets more diffused.\n\n384\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:31.930\nAnd basically, that's just saying,\nwhere does the effect start?\n\n385\n00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.930\nHow much of that drop shadow\nis the diffusion happening in?\n\n386\n00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.910\nSo, you can play with that and\nsee as you get bigger,\n\n387\n00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.570\nyou get more of a diffused shadow.\n\n388\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.400\nIf you want a hard shadow,\nyou come down here to 0, and\n\n389\n00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.370\nyou get this exact hard shadow.\n\n390\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.550\nAnd we're gonna put drop\nshadow on text in a second.\n\n391\n00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.940\nWe'll see where that comes in kinda handy.\n\n392\n00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.500\nBut for this, we wanted it to look\na little bit like an actual shadow,\n\n393\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.510\nso we get that fuzziness that's on there.\n\n394\n00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.990\nWe can also choose Spread,\nand this is again,\n\n395\n00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.190\nhow far into the effect that that happens.\n\n396\n00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.690\nIf I do back to 100,\nI get this round, hard shadow and\n\n397\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.540\nit doesn't look good at all.\n\n398\n00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.840\nIt doesn't look like a drop shadow.\n\n399\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.690\nBut it might be the effect\nthat you're going for.\n\n400\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.810\nI sometimes put this on type.\n\n401\n00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.118\nAnd then I kinda move the light around so\nit's kinda right in the middle,\n\n402\n00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:15.061\nand it just looks like the puffy\ntype effect that's on top of it.\n\n403\n00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:17.168\nSo play with that, and\nthen we also have Noise.\n\n404\n00:19:17.168 --> 00:19:19.010\nNoise is the last thing\nwe'll look at here.\n\n405\n00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.600\nWe can just put those\nspeckles that are in there.\n\n406\n00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.850\nHopefully we can see that.\n\n407\n00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.610\nThis kinda gives it\na kinda fun effect to it.\n\n408\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.920\nAgain, it depends on what the effect\nis that you're going for.\n\n409\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.880\nSo that's a drop shadow,\nwe're gonna say OK to that.\n\n410\n00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.970\nBut that's not actually what we wanted,\n\n411\n00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.300\nbecause we wanted that drop shadow on\nthe image itself and not on the frame.\n\n412\n00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.850\nSo keep that in mind, if I'm going to\nput a drop shadow on this flower and\n\n413\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:45.590\nI select the frame, I'm gonna get the same\neffect that I just got on that frame and\n\n414\n00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.090\nnot on the flower itself.\n\n415\n00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.460\nSo I wanna make sure\nthat I select the flower\n\n416\n00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.760\nwith either the Direct Selection tool or\nby using the Selection tool and\n\n417\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.910\nhitting the little content grabber,\nthe little translucent bagel that's there.\n\n418\n00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.889\nMake sure that I have the image selected,\n\n419\n00:19:57.889 --> 00:20:01.508\nand I can see that I do because I've got\nthis outline that goes way over here,\n\n420\n00:20:01.508 --> 00:20:04.131\nbecause again,\nthat's how big that actual image is.\n\n421\n00:20:04.131 --> 00:20:04.946\nI'm gonna come in here.\n\n422\n00:20:04.946 --> 00:20:08.136\nI'm gonna do the same thing,\nmove this off to the side a little bit and\n\n423\n00:20:08.136 --> 00:20:10.660\ngo back into Effects and\ngive that a drop shadow.\n\n424\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.340\nSo now I've got that\nsame nice drop shadow,\n\n425\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.690\nI'm gonna leave everything\nexactly as it is.\n\n426\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.580\nBut I can see that that drop shadow\nnow appears around the clipping path\n\n427\n00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.370\nthat we created.\n\n428\n00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.310\nI believe that was the clipping path, yes.\n\n429\n00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.220\nSo if I change this clipping path.\n\n430\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.460\nThat's actually, whoops.\n\n431\n00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.210\nI actually moved it.\n\n432\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.870\nWe didn't wanna do that.\n\n433\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.410\nLet's zoom in a little bit.\n\n434\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:33.620\nI wanna grab one of the points that\nare here, and just grab this and\n\n435\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.960\npull that out, and when I do,\nnot only does more of the image show, but\n\n436\n00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.450\nthe drop shadow moved with it,\nonly to the edge of that frame.\n\n437\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.730\nSo it's something to be aware of when\nyou're doing drop shadows is that, because\n\n438\n00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.490\nthis is sitting in that frame, that's\nwhere my drop shadow is going to end.\n\n439\n00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.160\nSo if we can, we can pull this out,\nbut if there's nothing there,\n\n440\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.410\nit's still going to end very\nstrangely at the end here.\n\n441\n00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.700\nWhoops, moved it again.\n\n442\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.890\nWrong keys.\n\n443\n00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.270\nI actually duplicated it.\n\n444\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.420\nSo, when it gets to that the edge\nof that frame or that picture,\n\n445\n00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.400\nthat's where the picture ends.\n\n446\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.960\nSo, we don't have anything\nsmoother to work with.\n\n447\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.080\nI could play with the path a little bit,\nand smooth it out if I needed to.\n\n448\n00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.010\nObviously not important in this instance,\nbut,\n\n449\n00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.580\nI just want to show you that what\nhappens when it hits the frame.\n\n450\n00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.380\nSo that's something you need to be aware\nof, if you are doing drop shadows.\n\n451\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.190\nThey pull your frame out far\nenough to actually accommodate\n\n452\n00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.360\nhow much diffusion you've put in that\ndrop shadow, and not just drop shadows,\n\n453\n00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.790\nany of the other effects.\n\n454\n00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.230\nSo, let's look at some\nof those other effects.\n\n455\n00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.760\nSo we've got a Drop Shadow.\n\n456\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.950\nWe've got an Inner Shadow.\n\n457\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.480\nJust kinda show you what\nsome of those look like.\n\n458\n00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.250\nThe Outer Glow, this is fun just\nto kind of give that, and again,\n\n459\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.830\nthat's something else I can do with text.\n\n460\n00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.490\nDo an Outer Glow,\ndo really hard shadow on that.\n\n461\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.730\nSo it's just actually is\na duplicate back behind.\n\n462\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.163\nInner Glow, might be hard to see,\nlooks like beveled edge almost, but\n\n463\n00:21:47.163 --> 00:21:49.067\nthis is what a beveled edge looks like.\n\n464\n00:21:49.067 --> 00:21:51.483\nAnd you'll notice as I'm scrolling,\nthe effects go away.\n\n465\n00:21:51.483 --> 00:21:55.800\nAnd that's again one thing that helps\nspeed up the processor is that,\n\n466\n00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.824\nas I'm moving it, it doesn't draw\neverything until I stop, and\n\n467\n00:21:59.824 --> 00:22:01.744\nthen it draws what it needs to.\n\n468\n00:22:01.744 --> 00:22:02.585\nAnd this is Satin.\n\n469\n00:22:02.585 --> 00:22:04.491\nI've never really had\ngood results with Satin.\n\n470\n00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.895\nI don't know,\nit just looks kinda weird to me.\n\n471\n00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:06.929\nIt looks dirty.\n\n472\n00:22:06.929 --> 00:22:09.821\nI don't know what it is, [LAUGH] so\nI don't usually use that one very much.\n\n473\n00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:11.588\nAnd then I've got a couple\ndifferent feathers, and\n\n474\n00:22:11.588 --> 00:22:13.044\nyou'll probably use Basic Feather a lot.\n\n475\n00:22:13.044 --> 00:22:16.802\nThis is if you want a nice vignette,\nyou can do this, say, around a photo.\n\n476\n00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:18.870\nWe'll do that in just a second as well.\n\n477\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.050\nSo I can do a photo,\nI can do a Directional Feather,\n\n478\n00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.610\nwhich means one side, I just choose\nwhich side the feather is on.\n\n479\n00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.990\nAnd a Gradient Feather,\nit actually fades to transparent.\n\n480\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.920\nSo if I have an image back behind,\nlet's just copy this guy and\n\n481\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.430\nI'm pasting him, and I paste him over\nhere and I'm gonna send him to the back.\n\n482\n00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:39.000\nI'm gonna use our stacking order and do\nObject Arrange and send that to the back.\n\n483\n00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.190\nWhen I do that, I can see that that\nyellow is fading out into the green.\n\n484\n00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.675\nSo if you had a photo and you had that\nfade off, you could actually have it fade\n\n485\n00:22:46.675 --> 00:22:49.485\nto nothing instead to white or\njust feathering off to the side.\n\n486\n00:22:50.685 --> 00:22:51.235\nSo let's do that.\n\n487\n00:22:51.235 --> 00:22:53.665\nLet's actually do some text drop shadow.\n\n488\n00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:56.725\nAnd also we'll do an image\nwith that feather around it.\n\n489\n00:22:57.765 --> 00:22:58.565\nSo, let's do that first.\n\n490\n00:22:58.565 --> 00:23:02.195\nI'm going to actually place,\nlet's grab this guy.\n\n491\n00:23:03.235 --> 00:23:04.313\nLet's do something here.\n\n492\n00:23:04.313 --> 00:23:06.439\nLet's do that image there.\n\n493\n00:23:06.439 --> 00:23:12.281\nAll right, so we've got here of\nthis cemetery near where I live.\n\n494\n00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:16.420\nI live in the desert so we don't have\na lot of grass in our cemeteries.\n\n495\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.377\nIt's just one of those, not ancient,\njust an old, old cemeteries,\n\n496\n00:23:19.377 --> 00:23:21.345\nit's one of the original\ncemeteries in town.\n\n497\n00:23:21.345 --> 00:23:23.409\nSo it's got some great, hard looks.\n\n498\n00:23:23.409 --> 00:23:25.556\nSo let's soften it up\na little bit with a vignette.\n\n499\n00:23:25.556 --> 00:23:28.403\nAnd the next thing I actually wanna do,\nI kind of wanted this in an oval.\n\n500\n00:23:28.403 --> 00:23:30.157\nI think an oval would've\nlooked better than a square.\n\n501\n00:23:30.157 --> 00:23:34.005\nBut when I just do Place, it automatically\nwants to place it into a rectangle.\n\n502\n00:23:34.005 --> 00:23:37.487\nIf I knew it was gonna go into an oval,\nI could've drawn the oval first, and\n\n503\n00:23:37.487 --> 00:23:39.642\nplaced it inside, but\nI'm gonna do this, and\n\n504\n00:23:39.642 --> 00:23:41.824\nI can change the object\nthat it's sitting in.\n\n505\n00:23:41.824 --> 00:23:44.310\nSo under Object,\nI'm gonna come down here and\n\n506\n00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.897\nI'm gonna convert that shape to\nto an ellipse, so we'll do that.\n\n507\n00:23:47.897 --> 00:23:50.322\nAnd I'll just make it a little bit taller,\nmaybe.\n\n508\n00:23:50.322 --> 00:23:51.560\nAnd that's looks good.\n\n509\n00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.465\nSo I'm gonna do that, but\nI'm want to put a feathered edge on this.\n\n510\n00:23:54.465 --> 00:23:58.575\nI go back up to the Effects panel and\nchoose basic feather, and\n\n511\n00:23:58.575 --> 00:24:01.725\ncome over here and I can see that it\ngave it a little bit of a softer edge.\n\n512\n00:24:01.725 --> 00:24:04.102\nI can play with the different\ntypes of corners.\n\n513\n00:24:04.102 --> 00:24:07.986\nSo it's either sharp, round, again this is\none of the ones that you just sort of play\n\n514\n00:24:07.986 --> 00:24:09.201\nwith and see how it looks.\n\n515\n00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:10.822\nAnd then we can also change the amount.\n\n516\n00:24:10.822 --> 00:24:13.094\nLet's give it a softer edge there.\n\n517\n00:24:13.094 --> 00:24:16.918\nI can add noise which is that speckle as\nwell if I wanted to, but that looks good,\n\n518\n00:24:16.918 --> 00:24:18.960\nand so I think, okay, that looks great.\n\n519\n00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.040\nBut maybe I decide I don't like that\nshape or I don't like the oval,\n\n520\n00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.290\nI need to change it.\n\n521\n00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.380\nAll these effects are live effects, and\n\n522\n00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.180\nthat's where this really shined when it\nfirst came out that you could do this.\n\n523\n00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.960\nBecause before, if I changed that,\nI had to go back into Photoshop and\n\n524\n00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.190\nchange my mask and import it.\n\n525\n00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.780\nThis way, I can just be like, actually\nyeah let's show a little bit more of this,\n\n526\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.700\nand as I draw it,\nI actually get the nice hardage,\n\n527\n00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.980\nso I can see, and\nthen when I let go I can see that as well.\n\n528\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.760\nNow you see, if we get too close to the\nedge here sometimes like the edge of this\n\n529\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.350\npicture you end up with that\nreally weird shape on the end.\n\n530\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.570\nSo you gotta make sure that you can\naccommodate not only the shape but\n\n531\n00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.500\nwhatever diffusion you have pass it.\n\n532\n00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.260\nSo, you always want to leave a little\nbit of breathing room there so\n\n533\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.450\nyou don't get weird hard edges to that.\n\n534\n00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.480\nSo, there we go, it's live effects,\nI can change that on the fly that way.\n\n535\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:08.740\nLet's do some text and we will put a drop\nshadow on that so let's do, what's it?\n\n536\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.483\nWe had one that was called a cactus bloom,\nright?\n\n537\n00:25:10.483 --> 00:25:12.270\nSo, Cactus bloom is what we'll say.\n\n538\n00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:16.340\nAnd again, we're going to work with text\nin just a little while, but we'll go\n\n539\n00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:21.670\nahead and put some text in here, and\nI want to put a drop shadow on that text.\n\n540\n00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:26.070\nNow, when I work with text, we normally\nwork with a text tool, but the drop shadow\n\n541\n00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.675\nis an effect Effect for an object, they\ndon't have to do anything to this text.\n\n542\n00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:33.665\nWe don't have to convert it to a compound\nshape or anything, it's just text.\n\n543\n00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:37.395\nAnd it will continue to be text that we\ncan change on the drop shadow update.\n\n544\n00:25:37.395 --> 00:25:39.485\nBut we do work with the frame itself so\n\n545\n00:25:39.485 --> 00:25:42.990\nas a little hard thing to get your head\naround sometimes you're not working with\n\n546\n00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.550\nthe type tool, we're gonna work with the\nSelection tool or the Solid Arrow tool.\n\n547\n00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:51.450\nSo I'm gonna select the frame,\ngo up under effects, choose Drop Shadow,\n\n548\n00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.480\njust like we've been doing,\nand there's my Drop Shadow.\n\n549\n00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.160\nNow I can change that, I said you could\ndo a hard one instead of a nice soft one,\n\n550\n00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.300\nlet's do a hard shadow, we come over here,\nand we'll just crank this down\n\n551\n00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:08.190\na hundred,\nlet's not do zero let's do zero there.\n\n552\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:15.690\nAnd I can go ahead and I can even make\nthe opacity 100% so it's a solid color.\n\n553\n00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:20.650\nSo instead of having two text frames back\nbehind, it's actually a drop shadow.\n\n554\n00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:25.189\nSo if I need to change this and\nsay BLOOMS instead I can do that.\n\n555\n00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.720\nJust drop to the next line there,\nbut it goes ahead and\n\n556\n00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.660\nit updates that effect that there.\n\n557\n00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.300\nSo again it's a live effect.\n\n558\n00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.060\nSo you can make changes to it and the drop\nshadow actually updates from there.\n\n559\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.970\nSo those are some of\nthe effects that you can do.\n\n560\n00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.450\nAgain, it's all transparency, and\none of the things that we need to\n\n561\n00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.680\nwatch out in transparencies is we\nneed to actually be able to view\n\n562\n00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.680\nthe transparency how it's going to look,\nwhether it's being printed or exported.\n\n563\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.180\nAnd when we get to the export episode,\nwe're talking about how to\n\n564\n00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.740\nGive the most optimized version of\neverything when we're exporting or\n\n565\n00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.150\nprinting then we'll look at transparency.\n\n566\n00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.020\nAnd transparency while fun is,\n\n567\n00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.610\nyou know, can have a little bit\nof downsides to it as well.\n\n568\n00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:12.070\nBecause if things are going to trip up,\nwhether it's exporting to PDF or printing.\n\n569\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.830\nYou're going to have some\nissues with transparency.\n\n570\n00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.490\nSo I wanna just look, one last thing we're\ngonna look at the different blend modes,\n\n571\n00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.120\na couple of the blend modes, just to show\nyou what the different ones look like.\n\n572\n00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.860\nSo I'm basically gonna create two shapes\nhere, we're just gonna overlap them,\n\n573\n00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:31.010\nand I'm gonna create one,\nand we'll make it blue.\n\n574\n00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.170\nCuz all I can remember is blue and\nyellow make green, so\n\n575\n00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.300\nyou see I gotta use\nsomething I can remember.\n\n576\n00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.912\nSo I'm gonna choose a blue color and fill\nthat, and I'm gonna do a yellow color on\n\n577\n00:27:39.912 --> 00:27:45.520\nthis one, and let's actually make that\na little darker there, there we go.\n\n578\n00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.040\nAnd then I'm gonna add\ntransparency to both of those.\n\n579\n00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.510\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect this item.\n\n580\n00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.300\nAnd I'm gonna go up to the effects panel,\nbut I'm not doing a drop shadow or\n\n581\n00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.060\nanything like that,\nI'm just choosing transparency.\n\n582\n00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.250\nOr, the other side of\nthat coin is opacity.\n\n583\n00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.190\nSo just keep that in mind,\nthat InDesign uses both\n\n584\n00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.640\nof those sort of interchangeably, they're\nsort of two sides of the same coin.\n\n585\n00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.280\nSo the opacity is how much color\nour light is coming through,\n\n586\n00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.430\nas opposed to how much this\nsolid item that we have.\n\n587\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.350\nSo in this case I'm just gonna\ndrop the opacity a little bit,\n\n588\n00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.880\ncuz it's the background item,\nI don't need it as much, and\n\n589\n00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.180\nI'm gonna use the basic\nbinding mode to start with.\n\n590\n00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.670\nWe'll do the same thing with the yellow,\nand come in to the transparency.\n\n591\n00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.740\nAnd I'm gonna drop this down\nto about fifty percent.\n\n592\n00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.710\nAnd I have it set to normal, and now you\ncan kind of see that it's showing through\n\n593\n00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.640\nthe blue, but\nit's not creating that green.\n\n594\n00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.680\nAnd that's what I would\nexpect when I put yellow and\n\n595\n00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.380\nblue together is to create green.\n\n596\n00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.730\nWith the normal blending mode does is,\n\n597\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:44.345\nit sort of creates what i like to think of\nlike a frosted window or frosted glass.\n\n598\n00:28:44.345 --> 00:28:45.220\nIt's sort of like what it did.\n\n599\n00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.850\nIf I had a yellow piece of glass, on top\nof that blue, it might just block it out.\n\n600\n00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.390\nIt's not really blending it together.\n\n601\n00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:56.670\nJust sort of saying here's transparency\nand it's like a frosted window in front of\n\n602\n00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.420\nit, where you'll get that mixture\ndepending on the colors, and\n\n603\n00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.610\ndepending on the colors space that you're\nusing, you might get that mix of green.\n\n604\n00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.310\nSo let's choose Multiply.\n\n605\n00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.430\nNow Multiply might be hard to see but\nit is a little bit green\n\n606\n00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.710\ndepending on the amount of transparency,\nbut it has a greenish tint to it,\n\n607\n00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:14.920\nbecause what Multiply does is\nit blends the colors together.\n\n608\n00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.600\nNow again depending on what\ncolors you're using you may or\n\n609\n00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:23.020\nmay not get the expected results with\nthat, because if you're printing it and\n\n610\n00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:27.000\nyou're using CMYK, and\nyou're using it for both of them, sort of\n\n611\n00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.280\nthe colors together if they have the same\nvalue, will sort of cancel each other out.\n\n612\n00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.430\nSo that's something to keep in mind,\nbut for\n\n613\n00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.800\na lot of stuff on screen\nwe'll be able to see it.\n\n614\n00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.550\nAnd the reason for that is that on screen,\nand we're talking with opacity,\n\n615\n00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:40.760\nwhich has to do with light.\n\n616\n00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.620\nWhen we're viewing it on screen\nwe're working with the light, so\n\n617\n00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.410\nwhat we see is what we get.\n\n618\n00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:49.380\nIt's when we try and put it on paper and\nwe're no longer working with the light, so\n\n619\n00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.660\nwe're trying to make it look opaque but\nyou can't really have opacity or\n\n620\n00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.700\ntransparency in ink,\nif that makes any sense.\n\n621\n00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:01.640\nSo it sort of has to make it up, so that's\nwhere your results may vary come in.\n\n622\n00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.190\nSo we can pull up\nthe different blend modes,\n\n623\n00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:05.430\nagain some of them don't make any sense.\n\n624\n00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.110\nWe have to come down\nhere to the bottom and\n\n625\n00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.690\nhalf the time I'm like I don't see\nanything, it just sort of knocked it out.\n\n626\n00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.850\nSo I basically play with the few that are\nat the top screen and overlay usually, and\n\n627\n00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.000\nnormal and multiply.\n\n628\n00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.910\nAnd multiply is that one where\nyou're going to get the actual,\n\n629\n00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.470\nit looks like you actually blended\nthem together and that's the.\n\n630\n00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.770\nIt is the one that drop\nshadow uses because it know\n\n631\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.290\nthat the drop shadow needs to show.\n\n632\n00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.830\nBut so does the object or object that's\nunderneath it needs to show through,\n\n633\n00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.660\nand that's the whole point of\nthe transparent effects is that you can\n\n634\n00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.800\nsee everything below like\nyou would in real life.\n\n635\n00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.900\nSo that's the sort of the low down\non transparency without getting\n\n636\n00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.700\ntoo much into it.\n\n637\n00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.370\nWe'll do a little bit more\nwhen we get to output,\n\n638\n00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.790\nbecause like I said, you come up with some\nissues that you have to watch out for\n\n639\n00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.720\nwith that, but that's some neat\ntransparent effects that we can use.\n\n640\n00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.340\nI love that they're live\ntransparency effects so\n\n641\n00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.320\nthat as you make changes it updates.\n\n642\n00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.250\nYou don't have to do round\ntripping to Photoshop anymore\n\n643\n00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.510\nlike in the bad old days.\n\n644\n00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.190\nI like how they're keeping your processor\nin mind in the background, too.\n\n645\n00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.650\n>> Yes.\n>> Because as a tech person,\n\n646\n00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:01.810\nthat's all I think of,\n\n647\n00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.410\nis how can I make this machine a little\nbit faster to support the end-user?\n\n648\n00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.100\nWell, it does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode, Erica, but\n\n649\n00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.270\nbefore we sign out, do you have\nany additional words on this one?\n\n650\n00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:13.100\n>> Nope, just remember that the\ntransparency effects might not look how\n\n651\n00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.600\nyou want at the end, so always be thinking\nof that, and test as you go along, and\n\n652\n00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.220\n>> Instead of waiting til the last minute.\n\n653\n00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.050\n>> All right, well results may vary.\n\n654\n00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.150\nThank you for being in the studios with us\nand thank you, the viewer for watching.\n\n655\n00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:26.190\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n656\n00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.883\n>> And I'm Erica Gamet.\n\n657\n00:31:26.883 --> 00:31:31.219\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n658\n00:31:31.219 --> 00:31:34.827\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.858\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:15.858 --> 00:00:17.114\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.777\nwe're coming back at you with more\nof the Adobe Creative Cloud, 2015.\n\n6\n00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:23.900\nAnd we're diving back into\nnone other than InDesign.\n\n7\n00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.780\nAnd joining me back in\nthe studios again is Erica Gamet.\n\n8\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.377\nErica, how ya doing?\n\n9\n00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:28.560\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.605\n>> All right.\nAnd thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:32.105\nthe journey you've taken us on,\nwhat is the next stop?\n\n12\n00:00:32.105 --> 00:00:34.065\n>> We're gonna do colors, finally.\n\n13\n00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:37.195\nI've been tempting you with\ncolors forever and ever,\n\n14\n00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:38.695\nwe're actually gonna\nstart putting colors in.\n\n15\n00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:40.185\nI know we've had some color in here but\n\n16\n00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.120\nnow we're gonna learn how\nto put the color in there.\n\n17\n00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.190\nSo we're going to talk about two different\npanels that deal with color in InDesign.\n\n18\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.959\nWe've got our color panel and\nour swatches panel.\n\n19\n00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:52.061\nI know that sounds kind of confusing but\nit will make sense in just a minute, so\n\n20\n00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:55.130\nlets go ahead and take a look at\nboth of those panels that are there.\n\n21\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.900\nSo i'm going to open up each of these and\nwhat I'm going to do is click on them and\n\n22\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.310\nI'm going to pull them off.\n\n23\n00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.520\nBecause, as we saw before, if you work\nwith the little buttons in the panels and\n\n24\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.240\nyou click one then the other ones go away.\n\n25\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.270\nBut in this case I want both of them\nworking at the same time so I'm going to,\n\n26\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.380\nwhat I call, rip them off.\n\n27\n00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.890\nWe're just going to rip them and\nfloat them around and\n\n28\n00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280\nwe're going to start with\nthe color panel first.\n\n29\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.520\nAnd the color panel is where we\nstart mixing or creating our colors.\n\n30\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.020\nNow colors can come from other places and\nwe'll look at that as well.\n\n31\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.880\nWhen we bring things in, in just a minute.\n\n32\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.770\nBut right now I want to work with\ncolors that I'm creating from scratch.\n\n33\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.970\nBut I do want to talk about\nthe different color modes.\n\n34\n00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.450\nTheres are three in end design.\n\n35\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.880\nOnly two that you'll, probably, deal with,\nand there's a lot of acronyms, and\n\n36\n00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.120\nI'm gonna throw a lot of color\nstuff at you, really quick.\n\n37\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.190\nIf you wanna learn more,\nthough, definitely go out and\n\n38\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.760\nlook into color theory.\n\n39\n00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.030\nI'm really bad with color theory.\n\n40\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.020\nI'll let you know that, right now.\n\n41\n00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.750\nI just mix colors until they look pretty.\n\n42\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.400\nBut, what you need to know is,\nyou need to know how this is being,\n\n43\n00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.610\nwhat the final destination\nof your piece's journey is.\n\n44\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.430\nWhere is it going?\n\n45\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.450\nIs it going to be viewed on screen solely?\n\n46\n00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.900\nIs it going to be printed?\n\n47\n00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.621\nOr is it going to be both?\n\n48\n00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:04.521\nIn the very, very, very early episodes we\ndecided when we created a new document,\n\n49\n00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.200\nwe said what is the intent?\n\n50\n00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.390\nWhere is this going?\n\n51\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.770\nWell one of the things that it does when\nyou choose an intent, if you chose print,\n\n52\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.660\nit automatically assumes it is in\nthe CMYK color space, and that is cyan,\n\n53\n00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.560\nmagenta, yellow, and black.\n\n54\n00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.040\nK stands for black,\nof course why wouldn't it.\n\n55\n00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.800\nBut what it is.\n\n56\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.002\nThat is the exact opposite of RGB.\n\n57\n00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.970\nYou've probably heard these acronyms and\ndidn't know what they were.\n\n58\n00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.930\nRGB is red, green, and blue.\n\n59\n00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.458\nSo when we are working on screen,\nwhether it is on your laptop or\n\n60\n00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:36.985\nyou're reading a PDF, or\nyou're viewing it on a television or\n\n61\n00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:40.170\nyou are viewing it on\na screen in a presentation.\n\n62\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.830\nYou're working with light and\nthe color of light and\n\n63\n00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.230\nthose colors that we deal with are red,\ngreen, and blue.\n\n64\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.300\nThe sort of opposite of those is cyan,\nmagenta and yellow.\n\n65\n00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.678\nAnd that's the flip side when you're\nprinting whether it's toner or ink,\n\n66\n00:02:54.678 --> 00:02:56.860\nyou're actually printing\nin something solid.\n\n67\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.069\nYou have to print in CMYK now I said\nthe opposite is CMY, the black we throw in\n\n68\n00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.360\nbecause if you put C, M and Y together,\nyou get a really nice dark brown.\n\n69\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.050\nNobody likes that, we want it to be black.\n\n70\n00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.210\nWe want our shadows to be black, etc.\n\n71\n00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.775\nSo, in the printing world we\nthrow in black as well and\n\n72\n00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:15.373\nthat gives it that rich texture.\n\n73\n00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:20.980\nSo RGB if it's going to be viewed on\nscreen, CMYK If it's going to be printed.\n\n74\n00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.390\nNow if you're doing both,\n\n75\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.590\nI said start with your intent at printing\nbecause it automatically assumes CMYK.\n\n76\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.960\nAnd CMYK has a smaller color spectrum,\n\n77\n00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.430\nmeaning you have fewer\ncolors to choose from.\n\n78\n00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.380\nSo if I start out building RGB colors,\nI get these great,\n\n79\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.690\nsometimes bright ones because\nwe're working with light.\n\n80\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.380\nI can get that bright color.\n\n81\n00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.810\nWhen I go to print that,\nI get that dull look.\n\n82\n00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.336\nAnd you might have done that, where\nyou created a color or something, and\n\n83\n00:03:46.336 --> 00:03:48.658\nno matter what you've been working in,\nand then you print it out and\n\n84\n00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:49.584\nit doesn't look so good.\n\n85\n00:03:49.584 --> 00:03:50.660\nLooks really dull.\n\n86\n00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.075\nMaybe your bright orange is now sort\nof a dark brown or a light, brown.\n\n87\n00:03:54.075 --> 00:03:57.735\nThat's because it did a color shift\nbetween those two color spectrums.\n\n88\n00:03:57.735 --> 00:03:58.855\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n89\n00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:00.355\nIf you are working and\n\n90\n00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:03.845\nyou told it its print, it automatically\nis assuming that you're going to print.\n\n91\n00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:07.630\nSo when we start putting colors that\nare outside that CMYK color spectrum\n\n92\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.210\nIt's going to give us an alert, and\nwe need to be aware of that as well.\n\n93\n00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.090\nYou can certainly work\nwith RGB colors in here.\n\n94\n00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.070\nBut just know that if you do go to print,\nyou may or may not get colors shift.\n\n95\n00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.330\nEspecially the brighter colors.\n\n96\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.650\nSo that being said, let's choose\ncolors and start making some colors.\n\n97\n00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.780\nNow for me,\nI'm going to open up the panel, but\n\n98\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.170\nI can see these are tiny little\nrepresentations of the color.\n\n99\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.520\nThat is really hard to get a good gauge\nof what that color looks like, so\n\n100\n00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.140\nfor me when am creating colors,\nI tend to go over to my shape tool and\n\n101\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.930\njust create a very large shape.\n\n102\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.530\nSo that as I have that selected and as I\ncreate a color, it will fill that color\n\n103\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.990\ninto that shape so I can see it,\nnow to be sure it is doing the fill and\n\n104\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.160\nnot the stroke,\nI need to build one of these items.\n\n105\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.760\nNow I have these icons over here,\nfill and stroke.\n\n106\n00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.190\nI also have them here in the color panel,\nand\n\n107\n00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.970\nI also have them here\nin the swatches panel.\n\n108\n00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.250\nAnd they get smaller and\nsmaller every panel that you go to,\n\n109\n00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.160\nthey are very tiny here and hard to see.\n\n110\n00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.860\nBut what we want to make and\nit doesn't matter which one we choose,\n\n111\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.390\nthey all kind of work together.\n\n112\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.723\nI wanna click on the one that is the fill.\n\n113\n00:05:09.723 --> 00:05:10.693\nHopefully you can see the difference.\n\n114\n00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:14.660\nThere's stroke, that's your outline of\nyour object, and then there's fill.\n\n115\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.280\nSo in this case I want to\nbe working with the fill of\n\n116\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.260\nwhatever object I have selected.\n\n117\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.040\nAnd I'm just like I said,\nI put that on the screen so\n\n118\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.330\nI can see the color as I'm mixing it.\n\n119\n00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.880\nAnd then I need to go up to the panel menu\njust over here on the upper right hand\n\n120\n00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.720\nside of the color panel.\n\n121\n00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.110\nAnd click on that and choose the color\nspace that I need to be working in.\n\n122\n00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.950\nWe're not gonna worry\nabout LAB color right now.\n\n123\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.700\nSo we gonna be seeing on my CMYK RGB.\n\n124\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.550\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n125\n00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.710\nstart with the CMYK because we all\nworking with print, let's work with that.\n\n126\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.730\nSo then I come down here\nto the color slider.\n\n127\n00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.662\nRight, so I come in here and\n\n128\n00:05:45.662 --> 00:05:51.052\nI just move my cursor through that color\nspectrum until I find a color I like.\n\n129\n00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:56.870\nNow, this is if I'm printing this and\nI know that I'm printing it in four color.\n\n130\n00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.473\nIf I am printing what's called spot color,\nyou don't have every color to choose from.\n\n131\n00:06:01.473 --> 00:06:04.399\nAnd if you do spot color, you probably\nare already aware of how that works, so\n\n132\n00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:05.490\nI'm not gonna go into that.\n\n133\n00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.290\nThat's a whole printing topic right there.\n\n134\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.050\nWe're gonna assume that you are going\neither digitally printing, or\n\n135\n00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.620\nyou've got all the money in the world and\nyou're printing four colors on a four\n\n136\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.920\ncolor offset press or\nwe're going digitally only.\n\n137\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.816\nAnd so we have all the colors\nthat the program can throw at us.\n\n138\n00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:22.845\nAll right, so we're going to do that,\n\n139\n00:06:22.845 --> 00:06:24.910\nwe're just going to build\nsome colors on the fly.\n\n140\n00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.990\nYou may know the CMYK values of\nthe color that you may need.\n\n141\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.560\nIt may be that you're working doing a job\nfor a client who has corporate colors and\n\n142\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.770\nthey will know what their spot color is or\ntheir pantone color.\n\n143\n00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.680\nWe'll talk about pantone in a second.\n\n144\n00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.980\nThey'll know what that color is,\nthey'll know what their CMYK and\n\n145\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.320\ntheir RGB equivalent of that is.\n\n146\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.620\nSo they're gonna probably\ngive you that value.\n\n147\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.098\nSo you can come in here to the value and\nput in the actual amount.\n\n148\n00:06:49.098 --> 00:06:52.260\nRight, so we just start putting\nin the value, whatever that is.\n\n149\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.080\nSee what lovely color we come up with.\n\n150\n00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.840\nA nice, kind of minty color, I guess.\n\n151\n00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.930\nSo I can actually put in the values if I\nwant or I can just use the sliders here.\n\n152\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.020\nBut what we wanna do when we find a color\nthat we like even if we're not sure we're\n\n153\n00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.860\ngoing to use it, go up to the panel\nmenu and choose add to swatches.\n\n154\n00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.380\nBecause there's nothing more frustrating\nthan finding a color you like,\n\n155\n00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.650\nchanging it to something else, and\n\n156\n00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.350\nthen not being able to get back because\nyou don't know what the values were.\n\n157\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.620\nSo add it to the swatches, and\n\n158\n00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.360\nwe'll see that it comes down\nhere to the swatches panel.\n\n159\n00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.760\nSo I went ahead and added it.\n\n160\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.650\nAnd in a minute,\nwe're gonna talk about adding them and\n\n161\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.450\nalso modifying the ones that are there.\n\n162\n00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.600\nSo now what happened is now it changed and\nthe color panel just shows kind of\n\n163\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.870\nthe color ramp or the tint ramp that\nthey call it of the color that's there.\n\n164\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.800\nSo here's all the different tints of that.\n\n165\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.104\nSo if I want 50%, I can try hitting\nright in the middle, pretty close.\n\n166\n00:07:40.104 --> 00:07:45.274\nIf I don't get it, I can actually type in\n50 I can also chose 100% of that color.\n\n167\n00:07:45.274 --> 00:07:48.850\nI can also choose the white and\nalso I can click it back to none, but\n\n168\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.488\nwhat I usually do is just look at the tint\nvalue and I'm gonna put that back to 100.\n\n169\n00:07:53.488 --> 00:07:56.106\nAnd just say okay that looks like good\n\n170\n00:07:56.106 --> 00:08:00.086\namount cuz I want good tint\nrange maybe for my document.\n\n171\n00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:03.883\nSo I say okay made this color but how does\nit look like you make a nice red, when you\n\n172\n00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:07.636\nknow 30% red is pink and maybe that's\nnot the color that you're going for.\n\n173\n00:08:07.636 --> 00:08:08.808\nSo, I like to look at and\n\n174\n00:08:08.808 --> 00:08:12.226\nsee if I've got a nice range of tints\navailable to me with that color.\n\n175\n00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.250\nBut I saved it,\nI can always delete it later.\n\n176\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.750\nSo I'm going to go back and I want to\ndo another one, so let's do CMYK again.\n\n177\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.340\nI can either keep going back to the panel\nmenu, or a little keyboard shortcut is to\n\n178\n00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.970\nhit the color ramp at the bottom\nwhile holding the Shift key.\n\n179\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.080\nWhen I do that ist cycles through\nthe color modes, CMYK LMA and RGB.\n\n180\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.220\nSo lets go back to CMYK and\nI can choose a new color.\n\n181\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.298\nThat one looks good.\n\n182\n00:08:34.298 --> 00:08:37.930\nAnd again, it's just selected over here so\nI can see what it looks like.\n\n183\n00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.610\nAdd to swatches.\n\n184\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.810\nYou can always set up a keyboard\nshortcut for add the swatches,\n\n185\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.450\nyou don't have to keep going to the menu.\n\n186\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.420\nI'm going to keep adding colors.\n\n187\n00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.680\nThose two look exactly the same.\n\n188\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.440\nI think I left them the same.\n\n189\n00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.190\nWe'll do that and\n\n190\n00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.230\nwe'll do one more CMYK and\nwe'll add that to the swatches as well.\n\n191\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.070\nThey are not very varied but\nthere they are.\n\n192\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.810\nThere are the colors that we have.\n\n193\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.850\nI'm going to go ahead and\ngo to the RGB color mode now.\n\n194\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.760\nAnd what I want to do, is I want to\npick a color that I really like let us\n\n195\n00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.380\ngo ahead here I really like\na really nice bright orange.\n\n196\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.650\nWhen I did that, I think it looks\nfantastic on the screen that was a great\n\n197\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.080\norange but I am printing this.\n\n198\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.800\nAnd you could see I've got this\nlittle exclamation point here,\n\n199\n00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.530\nthis little warning saying, that's great,\nbut it's out of gamut warning.\n\n200\n00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.680\nNot gamut like me, but gamut like color.\n\n201\n00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.990\nIt's out of that range.\n\n202\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.370\nSo RGB has this wide range,\nCMYK has a narrow range.\n\n203\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.630\nNow how does it know\nit's out of the range?\n\n204\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.280\nWhen we told it we were going to print,\nit said, she's going to,\n\n205\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.690\nshe's going to work in CMYK.\n\n206\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.160\nI can change that if I want, on the fly.\n\n207\n00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.440\nUp under the Edit menu, I can come\ndown to Transparency Blend Space and\n\n208\n00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.800\nchoose Document RGB or CMYK.\n\n209\n00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.300\nI'm not going to because I\nset it up as print, and so\n\n210\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.820\nI need to keep reminding myself.\n\n211\n00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.670\nthat's great, but this orange\nis not gonna look how you want.\n\n212\n00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.530\nBut I can always change that if I want to.\n\n213\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.950\nSo what happens with that?\n\n214\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.060\nWell I can leave it, just leave it to\nchance, and wait till I print it and see\n\n215\n00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.250\nwhat it looks like, or I can snap it to\nthe nearest CMYK equivalent if I want to.\n\n216\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.640\nI'm going to do that, so to do that,\nactually if I roll over this,\n\n217\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.440\nit'll tell me that,\nit just says click to correct.\n\n218\n00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.850\nSo watch the orange square, and you'll\nprobably see a color shift, and click it\n\n219\n00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.940\nonce, and it just got a little bit duller,\nI'm going to undo that so you can see it.\n\n220\n00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.160\nAnd click it again.\n\n221\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.300\nSo, it shifted a little bit.\n\n222\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.610\nSometimes the change is drastic, and\nsometimes you can't even notice it.\n\n223\n00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.920\nBut it is nice because it tells\nyou I can't recreate that in CMYK.\n\n224\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.180\nNow, I can click on that.\n\n225\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.840\nIt's still a RGB color, so\nit shifted the RGB values, but\n\n226\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.930\nit mimics CMYK so when I print that to\nCMYK it's not gonna shift colors on me.\n\n227\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.020\nSo again let's add that and that RGB\ncolor so we add that to swathes and\n\n228\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.340\nI will do one more in RGB.\n\n229\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.130\nStill a nice bright purple and let's\nnot snap it we just leave it nice and\n\n230\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.470\nbright, and\nwe'll see how that ships later.\n\n231\n00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.330\nAll right, and\nI'll add that to the swatches.\n\n232\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.870\nSo now,\nI've got a bunch of swatches over there.\n\n233\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.070\nI'm gonna close the color panel,\n\n234\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.050\nand now we're gonna work\nbasically with the swatches panel.\n\n235\n00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.190\nSo basically,\nI just loaded up all those swatches,\n\n236\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.320\nI can either leave this item here.\n\n237\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.300\nWhen I'm working with swatches though and\nmaking changes, every time I select\n\n238\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.550\nsomething to work on it it's going\nto change the item that's selected.\n\n239\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.800\nSo you may or may not want to\nleave that actually selected.\n\n240\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.550\nSo I'm going to deselect that.\n\n241\n00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.230\nSo what do we have?\n\n242\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.640\nWe have a bunch of swatches that are here.\n\n243\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.240\nThese are the ones that we just created.\n\n244\n00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.370\nI'm going to double click on one.\n\n245\n00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.920\nWell actually, let's look first.\n\n246\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.880\nI'll show you that it shows\nyou what the color mode is.\n\n247\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.620\nSo these little squares here,\nthis is CMYK, and these are RGB, so\n\n248\n00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.030\nit lets me know that that is\nthe color space that it was in.\n\n249\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.630\nAnd then also, there's just this one,\nlooks kind of like a blank square.\n\n250\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.990\nIt's basically telling me\nthat that's processed color.\n\n251\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.930\nProcessed color means that when we go to\nprint, we call that four color process.\n\n252\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.530\nWe do CMYK.\n\n253\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.700\nIt's not really called that\nwith digital printing, but\n\n254\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.020\nit is still the same sort of thing\nwhere you've got cyan, magenta, yellow,\n\n255\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.920\nand black ink, and they mix together\nto make all the different colors.\n\n256\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.270\nThat's what process is,\nas opposed to spot.\n\n257\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.020\nWhat a spot color is,\nis that I might print black and\n\n258\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.310\na spot color, you might hear this.\n\n259\n00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.940\nAnd this is only when you're\nworking in offset printing, so\n\n260\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.880\non an actual printing press,\nnot a digital press, but a printing press.\n\n261\n00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.320\nYou will hear spot color, so\nit might be black and a spot color, so\n\n262\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.470\nI might have black and Pantone-266.\n\n263\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.960\nAnd that is maybe my corporate color.\n\n264\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.040\nAnd so I would print on the press it\nwould go through, maybe at the same time,\n\n265\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.700\nmaybe separately.\n\n266\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.490\nIt will go though and print that black and\nthen you'll take actual 266 ink.\n\n267\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.610\nSo in a jar labeled Pantone 266.\n\n268\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.460\nPut that on the press and run it through.\n\n269\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.840\nSo, it's actually two different things.\n\n270\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.480\nNow that spot color,\nthose two colors I can't mix and\n\n271\n00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.330\nmake all the colors of the rainbow with.\n\n272\n00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330\nI can, basically black and\npurple mix together.\n\n273\n00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.340\nIt's not gonna look great,\nbut I can do that but\n\n274\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.310\nI also get all the shades of purple.\n\n275\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.110\nSo that's like a way to the work with it.\n\n276\n00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.960\nSo, if I got a spot color, I could\nalso do 50% of that and 75% of that.\n\n277\n00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.070\nAnd get some more shades.\n\n278\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.390\nBut it's still only what that\ncolor can produce, right?\n\n279\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.800\nSo, hopefully,\nthat kinda makes you think a little bit.\n\n280\n00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.900\nBut then again, offset printing.\n\n281\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.350\nNot a lot of people are doing that spot\ncolors anymore, because it becomes so\n\n282\n00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:01.240\neasy to do for color printing online,\nand it tends to be a lot cheaper.\n\n283\n00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.030\nBut you get what you pay for\nin a lot of it as well.\n\n284\n00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.270\nSo, spot color is becoming, I think,\na little more a specialty, but\n\n285\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.860\nthat might be what your specialty is,\nso you need to know that as well.\n\n286\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.550\nSo we're going to jump back\nto the swatches panel, and\n\n287\n00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.050\nlook at the colors we've created.\n\n288\n00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.590\nSo here's one we created,\nI'm going to double-click on it, and\n\n289\n00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.250\nit brings up the swatch\noptions dialogue box.\n\n290\n00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.120\nAnd your first choice is name with\ncolor value and that's what it did.\n\n291\n00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.720\nIt named it with this color value.\n\n292\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.690\nWell that is not helpful to me at all\nbecause I just look at the values and\n\n293\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:28.800\nthink, okay that's It's great.\n\n294\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.118\nIn my mind, I can't picture what\ncolor that's even going to be.\n\n295\n00:13:31.118 --> 00:13:34.760\nI'm gonna de-select that and\nnow I can give it a name.\n\n296\n00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.590\nSo we'll call this lime green\nbecause it's pretty bright.\n\n297\n00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.420\nIt automatically said it was processed.\n\n298\n00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.520\nAgain, I can choose spot if I want but\nI didn't build it as a spot color and\n\n299\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.650\nleave it as process.\n\n300\n00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.120\nI can now change the mode if I wanted to,\nthe RGB, I could do that.\n\n301\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.290\nI got a ton of other options a well that\nwe're not gonna deal with any of those,\n\n302\n00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.820\nI'm going to show you how to create\na pantone in a second though.\n\n303\n00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.840\nI'm going to leave that at CMYK.\n\n304\n00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.500\nBasically what I wanted\nto do was give it a name.\n\n305\n00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.610\nSo let's say OK.\n\n306\n00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.460\nNow it's got a nice name in there\ninstead of that color value.\n\n307\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.430\nI could change this one.\n\n308\n00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.080\nLet's go down here to this orange and\nit's RGB.\n\n309\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.040\nLet's call this orange.\n\n310\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.930\nAnd we'll change that to CMYK instead.\n\n311\n00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.650\nCome here, CMYK and say OK.\n\n312\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.790\nAnd now that changed for me as well.\n\n313\n00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.580\nAnd didn't give it a name, that's weird.\n\n314\n00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.830\nI thought I called it orange.\n\n315\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.790\nLet's Say okay, thee we go.\n\n316\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.410\nSo now I actually have again,\na named swatch that's there.\n\n317\n00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.530\nI can rearrange where the swatches sit.\n\n318\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.710\nThat's kind of handy,\nespecially if I start making tints.\n\n319\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.080\nI would like my tints to be\nnear the color that they are.\n\n320\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.550\nSo, for instance, let's take this\norange and I'm going to go ahead and\n\n321\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.820\ntell it I would also like\na 50% of that orange.\n\n322\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.890\nSo I'm just gonna come up here to the Tint\nbox at the top of the Swatches panel and\n\n323\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:44.760\nput in 50.\n\n324\n00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.760\nNow nothing changed, if I had to select\nI could see what the color looked like.\n\n325\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.840\nBut what I wanna do right after I do that\n50%, is I'm going to come down to this\n\n326\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.660\nlittle swatch icon at the bottom that\nsays new swatch and click on that.\n\n327\n00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.360\nSo now I have 50 percent of that orange.\n\n328\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.260\nSo if I select this and\nsay this is orange and this is 50 percent,\n\n329\n00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.200\nI can see the difference there.\n\n330\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.870\nI tend to move my tints\nright up underneath so\n\n331\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.810\nthey kinda all stay together.\n\n332\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.310\nBut the cool thing is this,\nif I say this is orange and then\n\n333\n00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:20.030\nI double-click on this orange and change\nit, so it's actually more of a yellow.\n\n334\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:25.710\nI say OK, not only did the items that\nhad that color applied to it change,\n\n335\n00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:30.060\nbut all the tints changed as well, because\nall those tints are kind of connected\n\n336\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.890\nto that solid color that's there.\n\n337\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.410\nSo, we can actually create those and\ngroup those together.\n\n338\n00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.650\nYou might see that I have some\ngroups down here at the bottom.\n\n339\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.260\nI call these groups our swatches.\n\n340\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.420\nI have my fun Living in the 90s colors,\nand I also have Welcome to the 70s.\n\n341\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.600\nSo, I've got these color groups.\n\n342\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.500\nAnd this is something you'll do.\n\n343\n00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.390\nIf you get a lot of\ncolors in your document,\n\n344\n00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.170\nyou might wanna start grouping\nthem together so they make sense.\n\n345\n00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.730\nBecause sometimes having a long, long,\n\n346\n00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.200\nlong list of all these is\npretty difficult to do.\n\n347\n00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.010\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect a few of them.\n\n348\n00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.350\nLet's say we want this green and\nthis purple.\n\n349\n00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.846\nI'm using Cmd or Control+Shift to select\nthose cuz they're not all together.\n\n350\n00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:08.293\nI'm gonna move those three items together.\n\n351\n00:16:08.293 --> 00:16:11.430\nThen I'm gonna go up under the Panel\nmenu and choose New Group.\n\n352\n00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.720\nLet's go over here, New Color Group.\n\n353\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.420\nAnd because I have them selected it's\ngonna throw all of those together\n\n354\n00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.840\ninside this group.\n\n355\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.300\nAll right, so I'll just call this Neon.\n\n356\n00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.950\nThey look kind of neon-y.\n\n357\n00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.710\nWe'll say OK.\n\n358\n00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.010\nSo now we have this color\ngroup called Neon, and\n\n359\n00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.340\nthose three colors that we just\ncreated are inside that group.\n\n360\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.160\nAll right, so we can actually make\ngroups just to make it a little easier\n\n361\n00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.520\nto work with, work with those swatches.\n\n362\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.640\nLet's create a new one, that's a Pantone,\nfor a spot color, just so we have one.\n\n363\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.880\nI'm gonna go ahead and whenever I\nclick new swatch, I wanna hold on\n\n364\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.400\nto the option or the alt key at the same\ntime, so it forces open the dialog box.\n\n365\n00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.700\nOtherwise it creates one called new swatch\nand then I got to double click on it.\n\n366\n00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.630\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\n\n367\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.220\nI'm gonna tell it that I want to\ncreate a new swatch at a 100%.\n\n368\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.560\nWhy is it not letting me choose anything?\n\n369\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.140\nAll right, I'm gonna not do that,\nI'm gonna go over here and\n\n370\n00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.640\nstill doing the new one,\nI'm gonna say new color swatch from here.\n\n371\n00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.850\nFor whatever reason it\nwasn't letting me do it,\n\n372\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:08.330\nfew bugs with this new\nversion that's out here.\n\n373\n00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.870\nSo see if we can figure that up anyway,\nI just did new swatch,\n\n374\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.990\nyou can get to it from the same place,\nand I'm not going to save it.\n\n375\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.610\nOr, I'm going to choose nameless color\nvalue because I'm going to choose a spot\n\n376\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.870\ncolor and a Pantone color, and\nyou don't get to change those at all.\n\n377\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:22.170\nSo I'm going to come down to Pantone.\n\n378\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.450\nNow, Pantone is a color matching system.\n\n379\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.990\nSo you might hear the term PMS,\nit's Pantone Matching System, and so\n\n380\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.160\nyou might Say PMS266.\n\n381\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.580\nThat's how you call out the colors.\n\n382\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.610\nNow the colors, depending on what you're\nprinting on, you've got swatch books.\n\n383\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.660\nI'm not going to go into any of that.\n\n384\n00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.210\nI'm gonna say, okay,\nI'm working with solid coated.\n\n385\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.550\nI'm going to choose Pantone colors, and\n\n386\n00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:46.310\nhere's all the Pantone colors that\nare available in that swatch book.\n\n387\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.100\nI'm can just type in the number, cause\nif my client says, hey, I've got 266.\n\n388\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.890\nI'm just gonna type in 266 and\nthere you go.\n\n389\n00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.750\nI'm not gonna worry about anything else,\nand then I'm gonna say Add,\n\n390\n00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.390\nand I can continue to add.\n\n391\n00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.390\nMaybe it says we're using 266 and 199.\n\n392\n00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.220\nWe'll say okay, great.\n\n393\n00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.410\nI'll add those two and say Done.\n\n394\n00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.680\nWhen I come back out,\nnow I had this group selected, so\n\n395\n00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.130\nit automatically put those\ncolors in that group.\n\n396\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.000\nWe can drag those out, but over here I now\nhave this little icon that's different.\n\n397\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.460\nIt's a spot, so\nit's telling me that's a spot color.\n\n398\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.760\nThat means when I go to do separations,\n\n399\n00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.430\nwhen I go to print, if I'm printing on an\noffset press I have to separate those out.\n\n400\n00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.210\nIt needs to send the black to one\nplate and the spot color to another.\n\n401\n00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.800\nIt knows that it's Spot and\nit's not going to mix them or\n\n402\n00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.860\nseparate them into CMYK values,\nit's gonna put them on its own thing.\n\n403\n00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.620\nAnything that has that red or that purple\npan tone will all print on its own\n\n404\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.615\noutput whether it's a plate or\nnegative, whatever we're printing.\n\n405\n00:18:38.615 --> 00:18:40.425\nLet's move these guys out of there.\n\n406\n00:18:40.425 --> 00:18:44.125\nJust gonna move these out,\ndrag them up, select both of them and\n\n407\n00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:46.855\ndrag it out of there so\nthey're not in that color booth.\n\n408\n00:18:46.855 --> 00:18:50.425\nAlright, so now what we can do at the end\nwhen we got all these colors, we created\n\n409\n00:18:50.425 --> 00:18:54.260\na ton of colors, maybe we're getting it\nready to send it to someone else to print.\n\n410\n00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.070\nIf we're sending it especially out,\nwe want to keep this as clean as possible.\n\n411\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.620\nWe don't want all this\nextra stuff in here, and so\n\n412\n00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.780\nwhat I want to do is get rid of\nany swatches that I'm not using.\n\n413\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.340\nSo I can do that,\ngo up into the panel menu.\n\n414\n00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.280\nAnd just come down here and,\nSelect All Unused, and\n\n415\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.690\neverything that we're not using goes away.\n\n416\n00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:15.650\nI can look inside here, even all this will\ngo away, all my colors will go away, and\n\n417\n00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.430\nI can just hit the trash can down\nat the bottom and they all go away.\n\n418\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.650\nSo all that's left is teal,\nwhich is apparently being used somewhere.\n\n419\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.940\nIt's not actually being used, I don't\nknow why it thinks it is, but it is, and\n\n420\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.600\neverything else goes away.\n\n421\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.030\nI'm gonna undo that and bring my swatches\nback so I have a lot to work with,\n\n422\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.690\nbecause we need to look at the stroke as\nwell, our color stroke that's in here.\n\n423\n00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.540\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\n\n424\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.530\nchoose Stroke,\nmight do it over in the Tools panel.\n\n425\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.620\nAgain, it doesn't matter\nwhich one you choose.\n\n426\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.650\nAnd I can do the same thing and\nsay okay, let's make this a nice\n\n427\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.690\nLet's do the lime green outline and\nthen we can actually change that.\n\n428\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.190\nI can come in here to Strokes and\njust maybe make that a little bit bigger.\n\n429\n00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.830\nSo I'm just making the line\nweight bigger for that.\n\n430\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.810\nWe're not gonna cover strokes a whole lot.\n\n431\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:02.410\nThere's a lot you can look into\nwith that but basically for me,\n\n432\n00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.830\nI wanna make sure that I have a nice\noutline to my frame and look at that.\n\n433\n00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.850\nI may also change things\nlike Just the type.\n\n434\n00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.230\nI have several different\nline types to work with.\n\n435\n00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.220\nSo for fun let's just make it\na dash stroke that's there.\n\n436\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.700\nSo stroke is the term that we use for\nline,\n\n437\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.450\nor key line is what we use to call them.\n\n438\n00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.770\nSo any ways I have my color set up for\nmy stroke, and\n\n439\n00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.300\nmy fill that's there and\nI can make changes to the colors on there.\n\n440\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.910\nLet's look with gradient.\n\n441\n00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.270\nI'm actually gonna come back to here and\nsay None on this, and one other color I\n\n442\n00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.100\nwant to mention, a couple of the colors\nthat are in here, that you'll have.\n\n443\n00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.910\nThey'll have Registration,\nBlack, and Paper, and none, and\n\n444\n00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.000\nthose are in brackets,\nwe can't make any changes to them mostly.\n\n445\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.850\nWe can make a slight change to paper, I'm\ngonna show you that in a second, but for\n\n446\n00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.910\nthe most part you can't\nmake changes to that.\n\n447\n00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.650\nThose are not changeable,\nthose are just built in to the process.\n\n448\n00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.150\nThe registration,\nyou're probably not gonna use at all.\n\n449\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.800\nThat just means it prints on every plate,\nbut\n\n450\n00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.090\nnobody really uses that very much anymore.\n\n451\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.790\nSo we don't wanna use that at all.\n\n452\n00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.040\nNone means there's no\ncolor there whatsoever and\n\n453\n00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.320\nanything that's sitting on\ntop of will show through.\n\n454\n00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.280\nSi I guess transparent would\nbe another way of saying that.\n\n455\n00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.440\nLet's look at paper and\nsee one thing I can do.\n\n456\n00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.940\nIf I double click on paper and\nthis is something that'll never print but\n\n457\n00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.700\nI can make a slight change to it.\n\n458\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.700\nIt automatically assumes you're\nprinting on white paper.\n\n459\n00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:24.340\nWhat you can do is you can just Mimic\nwhat your paper is going to look like.\n\n460\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.790\nIt's not accurate, because basically\nif I say I'm printing on blue paper and\n\n461\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.440\nI wanna see what everything looks like on\nblue paper, I have to sort of hold up that\n\n462\n00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.040\nblue sheet of paper to my screen and\nthen make a color that looks a lot like\n\n463\n00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.760\nthe paper, but it's not going to print so\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n464\n00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.250\nBut maybe I think, I'm gonna print on\nlight blue I can change the paper color\n\n465\n00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.680\nto light blue so that I can kind of see,\nthat doesn't look quite like I thought\n\n466\n00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.740\nit was going to, because otherwise it\njust assumes you're printing on white.\n\n467\n00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.450\nThen when I do things like None.\n\n468\n00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.380\nI've got no fill attached to it.\n\n469\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.730\nI've maybe got a stroke on there.\n\n470\n00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.900\nThen I can actually look at that and\ngo, okay.\n\n471\n00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.790\nThat's what it's going to look like\nwhen the blue is showing through.\n\n472\n00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.540\nSo hopefully that makes sense.\n\n473\n00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.810\nPaper doesn't print you're allowed\nto change what it looks like, but\n\n474\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.400\nit doesn't print or show up at all.\n\n475\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.050\nAll right let's actually\ndo some gradients now.\n\n476\n00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.330\nI'm going to tell it no stroke, and\nI'm going to go back to my film.\n\n477\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.120\nAnd I'm going to come over here and\nchoose a new gradient,\n\n478\n00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.000\nI'm going to say new gradient swatch, and\n\n479\n00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.330\nI'll just leave it at call swatch and\nI can choose linear or radial gradient.\n\n480\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:31.270\nSo a linear just goes across, a radial\ncomes out from a center in a circle.\n\n481\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.850\nAnd down here is where I make the colors\nthat I want in the by default,\n\n482\n00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.200\nit's black to white.\n\n483\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.020\nSo I'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna\nchoose what's called a color stop.\n\n484\n00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.860\nJust gonna click on that color, and\n\n485\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.050\nthen I can choose what color\nthat color stop is going to be.\n\n486\n00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:45.170\nSo I have some choices.\n\n487\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:49.520\nI can either build the color from scratch,\nor I can choose my swatches.\n\n488\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.480\nWell, since I already\nset up all those colors,\n\n489\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.580\nit makes a lot more sense\nto just use my swatches.\n\n490\n00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.490\nSo let's go from this orange 50%,\nwhich is no longer orange, it's yellow.\n\n491\n00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.740\nAnd then I'm gonna click on this other\ncolor stop on the right-hand side and\n\n492\n00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.340\ntell it what it's going to go to.\n\n493\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.250\nLet's make it go to the purple.\n\n494\n00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:10.400\nNow, if you go from a CMYK\ncolor to a Pantone spot color,\n\n495\n00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.570\nthis would not work really well when\nyou print, because one is being printed\n\n496\n00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.930\nwith four color process, one is being\nprinted as a spot on its own plate, so\n\n497\n00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.450\nyou really wouldn't do this some, but\nI just like the purple that is in there.\n\n498\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.840\nSo, we're just going to look at it on\nscreen so on screen it's perfectly fine.\n\n499\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.370\nIt's when you go to print that\nyou run into these issues.\n\n500\n00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.740\nSo, anyway I just went ahead and did that.\n\n501\n00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.590\nI can also tell it where\nthe transition happens.\n\n502\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.080\nSo right now it's 50%.\n\n503\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.970\nSo it's just 50% gradual\nall the way across, but\n\n504\n00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.220\nI can say I'd really\nlike some more purple.\n\n505\n00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.550\nSo I just drag that slider.\n\n506\n00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.820\nI drag the slider over here and\nit get's more yellow in there.\n\n507\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.200\nSo I can decide where that location is for\nthat slider.\n\n508\n00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:52.240\nIf I want a third color I just click down\nbelow and it adds another color stop.\n\n509\n00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.360\nAnd then I can go back and\nadd another color there as well.\n\n510\n00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.180\nSo let's do our nice let's do\nto the lime green in there.\n\n511\n00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.606\nSo now I've got three\ncolors in my gradient.\n\n512\n00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.050\nAll right, so\nI can keep playing with that.\n\n513\n00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.282\nI can play with the sliders.\n\n514\n00:24:04.282 --> 00:24:06.545\nI can delete them if I decide\nI don't like that middle one.\n\n515\n00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:08.339\nI can just go to the sliders.\n\n516\n00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:09.741\nAnd drag it off, right?\n\n517\n00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:11.753\nSo, we can create\na gradient swatch that way.\n\n518\n00:24:11.753 --> 00:24:14.537\nSo, I want to say Add and Done,\nand because I had that selected,\n\n519\n00:24:14.537 --> 00:24:16.996\nit automatically went and\napplied that to it.\n\n520\n00:24:16.996 --> 00:24:20.030\nIf I double-click back on the Gradient\nSwatch and I change it to radial,\n\n521\n00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.740\nwe can see what that looks like as well.\n\n522\n00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.950\nSo it works from the center outwards.\n\n523\n00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:29.360\nNow where we can play with that is I can\ncome over here to my Gradient Swatch tool.\n\n524\n00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:36.060\nAnd I can play where that gradient\nactually radiates from, if it's\n\n525\n00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:41.690\na radial gradient, I can just click and\ndrag, and that changes that center point.\n\n526\n00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.510\nSo for me when I'm doing a gradient,\n\n527\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:47.990\nif you do a really short one everything\nwill happen in that small section.\n\n528\n00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.500\nSo depending on how much you drag out,\nif I drag all\n\n529\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.890\nthe way from one corner to another,\nI get a nice gradient all the way across.\n\n530\n00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.460\nA short drag will get me that.\n\n531\n00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.323\nAnd whether that's a radial gradient, or\nif we had a background or linear gradient.\n\n532\n00:25:02.323 --> 00:25:06.550\nSo we could do that as well, I can\nchange the direction with that as well.\n\n533\n00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.970\nAnd again, short ones will make everything\nhappen in that short little distance,\n\n534\n00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.350\nso the actual gradient works\nin that small distance.\n\n535\n00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.910\nSo those are gradient swatches.\n\n536\n00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.780\nWe can actually view the different\nswatches separately if we want.\n\n537\n00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.490\nWe just see gradients or\nwe can see solid colors,\n\n538\n00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.310\nwhatever we can work with all of that,\nwe see just the color groups.\n\n539\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.340\nSo again anything we want to see in our\ncolor swatches we can work with in there.\n\n540\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.260\nSo that's how we create\ncolors that are there.\n\n541\n00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.550\nWe can also if we bring in\nan asset that has a color assigned\n\n542\n00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:41.270\nto it whether it's a Pantone color or Four\ncolor process it will come in as well.\n\n543\n00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.520\nI don't have a lot with Pantone colors\nanymore, I used to but now pretty\n\n544\n00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.920\nmuch everything I do is four color\nbecause most of it is going digitally.\n\n545\n00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.000\nSo I don't have that Pantone color\nbecause that is idealized for printing,\n\n546\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.140\nso obviously if I'm going digital I'm not\nusing those Pantone swatches anymore.\n\n547\n00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.510\nBut if I do have something with a Pantone\nswatch if I built it in Illustrator\n\n548\n00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.570\nwith the Pantone.\n\n549\n00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.640\nIt comes in and\nit brings in the same exact color, so\n\n550\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.610\nit'll just show up in your swatches.\n\n551\n00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.910\nBut you can also bring in\ncolors from other documents.\n\n552\n00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.510\nSo for instance, let's save this file out.\n\n553\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.520\nI'm gonna save that just as Untitled 4,\nand\n\n554\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.770\nI'm gonna create a new\ndocument really quickly.\n\n555\n00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.260\nAnd now I realize,\nI had all those great colors, but\n\n556\n00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.570\nI want those inside this document as well.\n\n557\n00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.290\nI've got the few that were\nhere because this is that\n\n558\n00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.940\nswatches panel as I have it set up.\n\n559\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:32.520\nSo I\"m gonna come into the swatches panel\nmenu and I'm gonna say, load swatches.\n\n560\n00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.590\nNow from here,\nI can load swatches from a document.\n\n561\n00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.360\nSo in this case, this document Untitled 4,\n\n562\n00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.280\nI wanna bring in all the swatches that\nwe just created, so I'm gonna say open.\n\n563\n00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.220\nIt's really not gonna open the document,\nit's gonna sort of just dig into it,\n\n564\n00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.980\npull out the swatches,\nand bring those in for me.\n\n565\n00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.130\nI'm gonna say open, boom, now I have\nall those colors that I just created.\n\n566\n00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.620\nNow it's super handy because now I don't\nhave to recreate those from scratch.\n\n567\n00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.310\nI am going to say undo,\nget rid of all those again.\n\n568\n00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.820\nGo back to the one that has\nall of our colors in it, and\n\n569\n00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.850\nmaybe I didn't want all those colors,\nI just wanted a few of them.\n\n570\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:08.158\nSo maybe I just wanted the gradient swatch\nand the lime green, that's all I want.\n\n571\n00:27:08.158 --> 00:27:11.836\nI can save that out as a file,\ncalled an ASE file, so\n\n572\n00:27:11.836 --> 00:27:15.704\nit's an Adobe Swatch Exchange File that\nI can use in all my Adobe programs,\n\n573\n00:27:15.704 --> 00:27:18.015\nwell not all but many of them.\n\n574\n00:27:18.015 --> 00:27:19.910\nSo use it in Illustrator and Photoshop and\n\n575\n00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:24.570\nI believe Dreamweaver and Indesign\nobviously and also Acrobat I think.\n\n576\n00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.021\nSo you can use but it's sort of\ncentrally located on your system so\n\n577\n00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:30.010\nthat you can actually use those.\n\n578\n00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.800\nSo I can come up here and\nsay save swatches,\n\n579\n00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.830\nI selected just those two, save swatches.\n\n580\n00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.184\nIt's going to automatically,\nit's gonna tell me gradients,\n\n581\n00:27:38.184 --> 00:27:40.100\nI forgot I can't save the gradients.\n\n582\n00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.580\nAnything that has real speciality color\nyou can't, just the solid colors.\n\n583\n00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.341\nWell one of them is solid so\nthat's good we'll have that one.\n\n584\n00:27:46.341 --> 00:27:50.970\nSo, I'll just call this colors are new\ncolors and it saves it as that ASE file.\n\n585\n00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.195\nSo, save that out to the desktop.\n\n586\n00:27:53.195 --> 00:27:55.775\nGo back to this new\ndocument that we created.\n\n587\n00:27:55.775 --> 00:27:57.725\nCome in to load swatches the same way, but\n\n588\n00:27:57.725 --> 00:28:01.415\ninstead of choosing an end design file,\nI choose that ASE file.\n\n589\n00:28:01.415 --> 00:28:03.845\nLet's bring that in and\njust that one color came in.\n\n590\n00:28:03.845 --> 00:28:06.470\nIf the other one hadn't been a gradient,\nit would have come in as well.\n\n591\n00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.540\nSo that's a way to bring in\njust select colors, as well.\n\n592\n00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.470\nAnd the last way to get colors\nin is that we can actually\n\n593\n00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.350\nsample colors from other places.\n\n594\n00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:20.320\nOne point to note, when you are working\nwith colors, don't use unnamed colors.\n\n595\n00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.870\nYou definitely want to name\nyour colors in some way.\n\n596\n00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:26.590\nAnd you also want to make\nsure that if you use it,\n\n597\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.530\nyou want to make sure\nthat you put it in there.\n\n598\n00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.550\nSo you can also do this\nif you are using colors.\n\n599\n00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.950\nLet's actually create a color here, let's\nopen up my colors panel, which got closed.\n\n600\n00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.575\nWe'll open that back up, maybe.\n\n601\n00:28:39.805 --> 00:28:41.995\nLet me reset my work\nspace here really quick,\n\n602\n00:28:41.995 --> 00:28:46.255\nwhen I do that everything will come back\nwhere I need it, there is my color panel,\n\n603\n00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:48.345\nlet's create a whole new\ncolor really quickly.\n\n604\n00:28:49.945 --> 00:28:53.325\nAnd am gonna use that but\nI didn't add it to the swatches.\n\n605\n00:28:53.325 --> 00:28:57.720\nBut the last minute I can come in here and\nsay add unnamed colors, so\n\n606\n00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.190\nI didn't name them and I didn't put\nthem in here but I can add them.\n\n607\n00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.700\nSo that because i'm using them but\n\n608\n00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.170\nI didn't put them in the swatches\nit's going to be really hard to find.\n\n609\n00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:10.760\nSo I make sure that I can just grab\neverything that's been selected.\n\n610\n00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.060\nThat's been assigned and\n\n611\n00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.970\nhasn't been added to my swatches panel,\nI can now have in design do that for me.\n\n612\n00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.742\nSo I want to make sure that's in there.\n\n613\n00:29:17.742 --> 00:29:23.646\nAll right so let's bring in some color\nfrom elsewhere, if I have a photo in here.\n\n614\n00:29:23.646 --> 00:29:26.140\nLet's find something with\nsome good orange colors.\n\n615\n00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.020\nOrange is my favorite color,\nyou might have noticed.\n\n616\n00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.670\nI haven't used it nearly\nas much as I normally do.\n\n617\n00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.700\nI'm just gonna bring in this color,\nor this photo,\n\n618\n00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.480\nand we're gonna grab\nthe colors out of there.\n\n619\n00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:41.070\nSo, let's actually create a text frame,\nand I want to assign text color to this.\n\n620\n00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.350\nSo we'll call it, this is Utah,\nit's definitely where this is.\n\n621\n00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.130\nLet's make this kind of big,\nwe'll make it bold.\n\n622\n00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.697\nAnd we'll make it,\nlet's make it trebuchet bold.\n\n623\n00:29:51.697 --> 00:29:55.489\nAll right, so we have that and\nI just wanna make this super big so\n\n624\n00:29:55.489 --> 00:29:57.290\nwe can see the color.\n\n625\n00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:00.020\nSo one of the things we can do\nis not just assign to shapes but\n\n626\n00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.740\nwe can actually assign text to color.\n\n627\n00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.935\nI'm sorry, color to text and I want to\nmake sure I've got my swatches here.\n\n628\n00:30:08.155 --> 00:30:12.717\nI lost my swatches panel again\nbecause that's what happens to me.\n\n629\n00:30:12.717 --> 00:30:17.395\nAll right come over here and\nsay where's my color swatches.\n\n630\n00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:23.660\nLet's close that up, so in here,\nI can assign color to a text.\n\n631\n00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.680\nBefore what we've been doing is this\nlittle square has been selected.\n\n632\n00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.450\nIt's a formatting text, the container,\nso it's a stroke-filler container.\n\n633\n00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.130\nIf I have text, I can choose text.\n\n634\n00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.870\nYou noticed, I just had the text frame\nselected with the Selection Tool.\n\n635\n00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.250\nI did not select the individual letters,\nI'm selecting the frame itself.\n\n636\n00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.500\nBut I can select that frame and\nthen come over here and\n\n637\n00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.690\nsay the formatting affects the text.\n\n638\n00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.520\nI can work with the fill or the stroke and\nyou noticed that changed to a little T.\n\n639\n00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.870\nIt's not just the big\ncolor square anymore.\n\n640\n00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:56.070\nSo now I can say okay I would\nlike the color text to be blue or\n\n641\n00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.230\ngreen or whatever.\n\n642\n00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:02.060\nBut I can also create new colors\nbased on a photo or an image and\n\n643\n00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.600\nhave that color assigned\nto the text as well.\n\n644\n00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.260\nSo what I can do is come over\nhere in the tools panel.\n\n645\n00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.510\nAnd under the color theme tool,\nif you have an older version your color\n\n646\n00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.410\ntheme tool is pretty new and\nwon't be there.\n\n647\n00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.980\nYou'll see the eye dropper tool which\nis what we want, the eye dropper tool.\n\n648\n00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:21.680\nAnd I get, let's see if you can see this,\nwhen I zoom in, it's a white eye dropper.\n\n649\n00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.090\nSo it's an empty eye dropper and\nI'm gonna pick up some colors.\n\n650\n00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.490\nFrom this image that's in here, so\nI'm just gonna go a head and click.\n\n651\n00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.100\nNow because I have this frame selected and\n\n652\n00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.020\nthe T is telling me it's formatting\nthe text and I'm working on the fill.\n\n653\n00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.820\nAs I create new colors or\nsample colors from this image\n\n654\n00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.660\nit will actually apply it to\nthe letters that I selected.\n\n655\n00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.770\nSo I will just click and\nI can say I like that a lot.\n\n656\n00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.220\nNow I could add this point\nopen my color panel.\n\n657\n00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.000\nAnd I could go ahead and\nassign that to swatches if I want.\n\n658\n00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.980\nAdd that to my swatches and that's\nwhat I usually do when I'm sampling,\n\n659\n00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.530\nnow I've got that full eye dropper.\n\n660\n00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:00.610\nWhat I want is an empty eye dropper so\nI need to hold on the Option or Alt key.\n\n661\n00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.720\nSo come back over here and\nI'm going to Option or\n\n662\n00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.690\nAlt, I'm holding down the Option key and\njust selecting.\n\n663\n00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.650\nI'm just clicking until\nI find a color I like,\n\n664\n00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.882\nokay that one looks good,\nlet's add that to the swathes.\n\n665\n00:32:11.882 --> 00:32:13.630\nAll right let's try another one,\n\n666\n00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.680\nlet's come down here to like\nmaybe one of the green colors,\n\n667\n00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.210\ntrying to find a light green, there we go,\nthat's kind of a brownish green.\n\n668\n00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.280\nAdd the swatches, so I can go through and\ncontinually sample that.\n\n669\n00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.490\nAnd let's see what we ended up with.\n\n670\n00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.620\nThere's your three colors we just created.\n\n671\n00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.420\nNow, they're all in RGB.\n\n672\n00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.660\nIf I had been working\nwith all CMYK colors and\n\n673\n00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:35.060\nthen suddenly had these RGB, the reason\nfor that is the image itself is in RGB.\n\n674\n00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.220\nSo whatever we sample in,\n\n675\n00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.770\nwhatever color space that image is,\nis the sample I'm gonna get.\n\n676\n00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.610\nSo that's usually how I get images.\n\n677\n00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.900\nThey're usually RGB,\nbecause they usually come from a camera or\n\n678\n00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:50.710\nthey're jpegs from stock photography,\nso they're in the RGB colorspace.\n\n679\n00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:51.420\nSo that's fine,\n\n680\n00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.770\nbecause even if I know I'm printing this,\nI can now take each of these, and\n\n681\n00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:00.670\nI can double-click on them and I can\nsay let's go ahead and make those CMYK.\n\n682\n00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:04.180\nSo I get those set if we're going\nto print, and we'll say okay and\n\n683\n00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.730\nnow all those are all CMYK even though\nI just sampled them from an RGB image.\n\n684\n00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.830\nSo that's another way\nto get color in there.\n\n685\n00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.160\nSo now we have colors available to us.\n\n686\n00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.690\nAnd the last thing I wanna\ntell you about colors is that\n\n687\n00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:18.630\nwhen I close out both of these documents,\nyou notice that the color swatches that I\n\n688\n00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.960\nhave are those two color\ngroups that I have.\n\n689\n00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.770\nAnd I don't have CMY listed at all.\n\n690\n00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.250\nThat's because I deleted those from\nmy panel cuz I never used just those\n\n691\n00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.170\ncolors by themselves, you don't.\n\n692\n00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.760\nIf you have an image in there,\nit needs to be separated in the CMYK.\n\n693\n00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.880\nIt's smart enough to\nknow to give you CMYK.\n\n694\n00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.610\nSo you don't even need to\nhave them in your swatches.\n\n695\n00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.570\nThey just take up room\nas far as I'm concerned.\n\n696\n00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.580\nAnd I have these because I want\nthese to show up in every document\n\n697\n00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.720\nthat I'm demoing.\n\n698\n00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.215\nSo what you can do, we talked about\npreferences in an earlier episode.\n\n699\n00:33:46.215 --> 00:33:49.230\nIf you set a preference\nwith no document open\n\n700\n00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.510\nthen it becomes the default behavior for\nall new documents.\n\n701\n00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.310\nSo in this case, I went ahead and\ncreated these colors and\n\n702\n00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.710\nadded them to the swatches and made\nthe color groups with no document open.\n\n703\n00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:01.520\nSo that now,\n\n704\n00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.440\nevery new document that I create has\nthat same exact set of swatches.\n\n705\n00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.000\nSo if you have Corporate colors or\nas colors you like to use all the time.\n\n706\n00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.480\nClean it up,\nmake it how you wanna look and\n\n707\n00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.930\nyou always have those\ncolors available to you.\n\n708\n00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:14.430\nAnd you don't have to build them\neach time you create a new document.\n\n709\n00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.410\n>> Very good, thank you for\nthat demonstration there, Erica.\n\n710\n00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:20.420\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n711\n00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.150\nBut before we do,\n\n712\n00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:24.010\ndo you have any additional words you'd\nlike to throw in about applying color?\n\n713\n00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:26.200\n>> Just know where it's gonna end up so\n\n714\n00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.340\nyou know what color space\nyou should be working in.\n\n715\n00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.560\n>> Great advice, thank you for\nbeing here in the studios with us.\n\n716\n00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.880\nAnd thank you the viewer for watching.\n\n717\n00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.530\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n718\n00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.540\n>> And I'm Erica Gavin.\n\n719\n00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.480\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n720\n00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:46.130\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.779\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.176\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:22.119\nThat's right, more InDesign, and\n\n6\n00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.707\njoining me back in the studios again\nis none other than Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:26.671\nErica, how are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:28.030\n>> I'm doing great, thanks.\n\n9\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.284\n>> Great, so we've been, again,\nthrough this journey in InDesign,\n\n10\n00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:32.361\nwhat is our next stop?\n\n11\n00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:35.230\n>> Text at last,\nwe're finally going to get some text.\n\n12\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.988\nWe're gonna start putting text into our\ndocument, and we can have words now with\n\n13\n00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:41.810\nall the pictures and all the designs\nthat we've been putting in here.\n\n14\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.580\nSo let's go a head and\njump right in with some text.\n\n15\n00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.607\nSo the first thing I wanna do is trade\na text frame, and in the early episode,\n\n16\n00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:50.754\nI showed you how to create a text frame,\nand we put some placeholder text in it.\n\n17\n00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:54.090\nBut now we gonna actually bring some text\nin and actually work with that text.\n\n18\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.745\nSo to start with, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:55.745 --> 00:01:00.150\njust show you some of the text\noptions that you have inside InDesign.\n\n20\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.460\nSo I'm gonna choose the Type tool,\nand I'm gonna drag out a text frame.\n\n21\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.621\nAnd in this case, I'm just gonna go\nahead and fill with placeholder text.\n\n22\n00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:11.067\nI'm gonna use a keyboard\nshortcut that I setup, F2.\n\n23\n00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:14.265\nIf you don't have that, you can go up\nunder the Type menu, down to the bottom,\n\n24\n00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:15.486\nFill with Placeholder Text.\n\n25\n00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:19.850\nAnd that just throws in that placeholder\ntext that you have in your document.\n\n26\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.897\nIt may not look like this.\n\n27\n00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:23.713\nAgain, I set up a custom\none in a previous episode,\n\n28\n00:01:23.713 --> 00:01:26.215\nso I have some actual\nEnglish text to look at.\n\n29\n00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:29.113\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nsee what that looks like.\n\n30\n00:01:29.113 --> 00:01:32.181\nAnd I've got my type in a text frame.\n\n31\n00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:36.030\nAgain, text and type, one of those\nthings that's interchangeable InDesign,\n\n32\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.423\njust keep that in mind, I may say\nthe wrong one, but it's type or text,\n\n33\n00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:41.840\nwhatever we're working with.\n\n34\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.660\nSo to type text,\nif I wanna actually type something,\n\n35\n00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.880\nI just double-click inside a text frame,\nand I get my text cursor.\n\n36\n00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.250\nAnd I'm just gonna put the cursor at\nthe very beginning of that paragraph, and\n\n37\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.150\nI'm just gonna hit a couple returns just\nto get a little bit of breathing room.\n\n38\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.870\nI'm gonna tell you later in a later\nepisode why we don't actually wanna\n\n39\n00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.910\ndo those harder turns,\na bunch of those in order.\n\n40\n00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.358\nBut I am right now just to kind\nof push the text out of the way.\n\n41\n00:02:02.358 --> 00:02:03.567\nThe other thing I can do,\n\n42\n00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:06.515\nis I can just start obviously\ntyping inside of here, right.\n\n43\n00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:07.460\nHere's the text.\n\n44\n00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.880\nI'm not gonna worry about typos,\nprobably gonna have those.\n\n45\n00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.390\nI type way too quickly sometimes.\n\n46\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.378\nBut I have the text, and\n\n47\n00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:17.403\nI just wanna show you a little bit about\nhow to select it and how to move it.\n\n48\n00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:20.941\nSo it works a little differently than\nsomething if you've been working with\n\n49\n00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:24.924\nsomething like Word, where you can select\nseparate words, non-congruous words,\n\n50\n00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:28.262\nnon-contiguous words, that's the word,\nnon-contiguous words.\n\n51\n00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:29.964\nAnd InDesign, you can't.\n\n52\n00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:32.848\nI can't select the word Here and\nthe word text.\n\n53\n00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:34.510\nI can select everything in between.\n\n54\n00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.040\nSo couple different things,\n\n55\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.960\nI can double-click on a word\nto select an entire word.\n\n56\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.740\nBy default, I can triple-click\nto select an entire line.\n\n57\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.688\nSo if I'm down here, and\nI just want that line, I can.\n\n58\n00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:48.050\nAnd I can quadruple-click\nto select a paragraph.\n\n59\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.111\nThat is a lot of clicking,\n\n60\n00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:51.733\nyou probably will end up with\nsome repetitive stress injuries.\n\n61\n00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:59.430\nI actually have, at my working desk,\nI have a mouse, it's a track ball.\n\n62\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.890\nI can do a double-click with two fingers,\ndouble-click, and that actually saves\n\n63\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.850\nme a lot of time, because I am constantly\nneeding to select an entire paragraph.\n\n64\n00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.550\nI'm gonna show you where you can\nrid of that triple-click line.\n\n65\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.290\nThat will save you a little bit, so\nyou can triple-click for a paragraph.\n\n66\n00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.570\nThat's in your preferences, so\n\n67\n00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.620\nI'm going to show you where to\nchange that really quickly.\n\n68\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.170\nIt's either under InDesign Menu\npreferences if you're on a Mac.\n\n69\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.441\nOr it's under Edit preferences\nif you're on a PC.\n\n70\n00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:27.869\nNow we'll go into here, and we'll go\ninto the, let's see, the Type menu.\n\n71\n00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.500\nSometimes I try to remember where it is,\nand I did notice that they just changed\n\n72\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.822\na few things where they\nsat in the newest version.\n\n73\n00:03:33.822 --> 00:03:37.027\nAgain, that's a game I like to play,\nwhere did they move my preferences and\n\n74\n00:03:37.027 --> 00:03:38.343\nwhere did they move my panels.\n\n75\n00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.770\nTriple-click to Select\na Line is right here.\n\n76\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.830\nSo it's in the Type pane, and\nit's Triple-click to Select a Line.\n\n77\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.040\nI can turn that off, so\nthat the triple-click becomes paragraph.\n\n78\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.965\nBecause very rarely do I need\nto select just one line,\n\n79\n00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:52.575\nbecause I'm probably not\ngonna select a line.\n\n80\n00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:55.000\nOf course, now I can't do it,\nbecause I turned that off.\n\n81\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.870\nI'm not gonna select one line and\nthen make a change to just that line.\n\n82\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.060\nI'm probably working with either a word or\nan entire paragraph.\n\n83\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.260\nThe other thing that I can do is I can\ndouble-click to select a word, and\n\n84\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.040\nthen I can either Shift+Select and\n\n85\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.893\nclick the end of my selection that I want,\nand it selects everything in between.\n\n86\n00:04:10.893 --> 00:04:15.460\nOr maybe if I wanna choose a group of\nwords, I can double-click on one word, and\n\n87\n00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.890\nhold down the Shift key and\ndouble-click on the next word, and\n\n88\n00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.260\nit selects everything in between.\n\n89\n00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.451\nSo again, it has to be connected,\nhas to grab everything in between.\n\n90\n00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:28.832\nThe other thing that I can do is I\ncan send this to the end of a story,\n\n91\n00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:31.070\nI can't see the end of my story.\n\n92\n00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.693\nI have what's called overset text.\n\n93\n00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:33.979\nI'm actually going to zoom in on that.\n\n94\n00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.593\nAnd I have this little plus, and\nthat means there's more to that story.\n\n95\n00:04:36.593 --> 00:04:38.761\nWe're gonna discuss that\nin a future episode.\n\n96\n00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:42.422\nWe're gonna talk about what happens\nwhen it ends where there's too much text\n\n97\n00:04:42.422 --> 00:04:43.054\nfor a frame.\n\n98\n00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:44.014\nWe'll talk about that later.\n\n99\n00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:49.409\nBut if I wanna jump my cursor to\nthe end of that, I can do end.\n\n100\n00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.331\nNow I can't do that on my laptop because\nApple got rid of the ten key from\n\n101\n00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:55.675\nthe MacBook Pros.\n\n102\n00:04:55.675 --> 00:04:58.939\nSo I have no way to use the keys\nthat I used to be able to use,\n\n103\n00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.532\nwhich were my End keys and\nmy Beginning keys.\n\n104\n00:05:01.532 --> 00:05:06.926\nSo if you're on a regular keyboard and\nyou click End, it will automatically\n\n105\n00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:11.740\nsend the cursor to the end of\nthe story even if you can't see it.\n\n106\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.660\nI can send it there.\n\n107\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.260\nThen what I can do is say,\nsend it to the end.\n\n108\n00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.158\nSo let's pretend that it's\nall the way at the end.\n\n109\n00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:17.946\nBut right now it's just at\nthe end of the visual story.\n\n110\n00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:22.389\nThen you can hold down the Shift key and\nclick at the beginning of the first one,\n\n111\n00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.678\nand it selects everything in the story,\n\n112\n00:05:24.678 --> 00:05:27.470\nincluding all the stuff\nthat you can't see.\n\n113\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.940\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n114\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.230\nThere's also something called the Story\nEditor, which I won't go into a lot, but\n\n115\n00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.180\nI will show you that if you do\nhave what's called overset text,\n\n116\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.650\ntext that's hanging outside that text\nframe, you can actually get to it.\n\n117\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.908\nSo Cmd or\nCtrl+Y brings up the Story Editor.\n\n118\n00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:45.850\nSo it basically shows you the text in\njust sort of plain text format, but\n\n119\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.590\nthe cool thing is,\nI could see here, this is overset.\n\n120\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.750\nSo now I see everything, this are all\nthe words that I'm missing from here.\n\n121\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.679\nSo I could actually come in here and do a\nCmd or Ctrl+A and select everything here.\n\n122\n00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:59.186\nAnd now when I jump back to\nmy regular story over here,\n\n123\n00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:01.432\nI know that that's\nactually selected as well.\n\n124\n00:06:01.432 --> 00:06:04.192\nAll right, so\nI can make changes in the story.\n\n125\n00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:08.637\nThat's something to check out on your own,\ndefinitely a cool thing we can see a lot\n\n126\n00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:11.872\nof stuff that we can't see on the page or\nthe layout editor.\n\n127\n00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:16.900\nAll right, so some of the other things\nthat we can do is we can select and move.\n\n128\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.785\nSo if I select some text here and\n\n129\n00:06:19.785 --> 00:06:24.652\nI wanna move it somewhere else,\nby default, I have to copy that, so Cmd or\n\n130\n00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:29.920\nCtrl+C ,or I can do edit copy and then\nscroll down wherever it is I wanna put it.\n\n131\n00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.204\nLet's put it down here,\nI'm just gonna pull a space and put paste,\n\n132\n00:06:34.204 --> 00:06:36.093\nCmd or Ctrl+V to paste that.\n\n133\n00:06:36.093 --> 00:06:39.400\nNow you may be used to using what\nis called drag and drop editing,\n\n134\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.110\nwhere you grab a word and\nyou just drag it and move it.\n\n135\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.011\nIf you're coming from\nthe world of Word especially,\n\n136\n00:06:44.011 --> 00:06:46.125\nthis is something that you're used to.\n\n137\n00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.860\nThese are all preference that\nwe can turn on in InDesign.\n\n138\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.666\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n139\n00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:51.080\nI'm gonna go into Preferences.\n\n140\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.143\nAnd we're gonna look at a couple different\nPreferences that work the way you were\n\n141\n00:06:55.143 --> 00:06:58.441\nprobably used to if you're coming\nfrom a Word processing world.\n\n142\n00:06:58.441 --> 00:07:00.400\nSo let's go back to Preferences.\n\n143\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.790\nAnd I'm gonna come down and choose on\nhere, it doesn't matter which one you\n\n144\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.190\nchoose from that pull-down menu, you get\nall the access to all the panes here.\n\n145\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.090\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose Type, and\n\n146\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.350\nI'm going to choose Drag and\nDrop Text Editing.\n\n147\n00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.781\nNow, I can choose whether or not to\ndo it in Layout View or Story Editor.\n\n148\n00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:19.720\nStory Editor is what I just showed you,\nwe're not gonna actually work with that.\n\n149\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.470\nWe'll just say Enable in Layout View.\n\n150\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.980\nAnd what that does is that lets us grab\nthat if I decide I don't want this word\n\n151\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.140\nhere, and\nI wanted to just grab it and drag it.\n\n152\n00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.234\nI can select this text and now my cursor,\nlet's see if we can see that,\n\n153\n00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:34.505\nlet's zoom in a little bit.\n\n154\n00:07:34.505 --> 00:07:37.545\nHopefully, you can see that my\ncursor now turned to this little t,\n\n155\n00:07:37.545 --> 00:07:38.807\nthis little arrow with a t.\n\n156\n00:07:38.807 --> 00:07:43.450\nAnd that basically lets me know that\ndrag and drop text editing is on.\n\n157\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.724\nWhat I can do with that is I\ncan drag this, just grab it and\n\n158\n00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:50.024\ndrag it down from wherever my\ncursor is and drop it here.\n\n159\n00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:53.097\nAnd it actually moved it from\nthat space to that space.\n\n160\n00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:57.561\nI did a drag and drop text editing,\ngonna undo that cuz what I might wanna go\n\n161\n00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:01.174\nis actually Actually copy it,\nbut also with drag and drop.\n\n162\n00:08:01.174 --> 00:08:05.018\nSo what I need to do is start dragging it\nfirst and then hold down the Option or\n\n163\n00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:06.130\nthe Alt key.\n\n164\n00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.040\nWhen I do that,\nmy cursor changes to a double arrow.\n\n165\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.610\nHopefully you can see that as well.\n\n166\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.600\nSo I come in here, drag and drop.\n\n167\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.640\nSo now it moved it over,\nit copied it over.\n\n168\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.160\nBut it also left it where it was.\n\n169\n00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.610\nBut again, that's drag and drop editing.\n\n170\n00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.410\nYou have to have that turned on.\n\n171\n00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.350\nYou may also want to drag and\ndrop to a new frame.\n\n172\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.290\nI'm gonna do that.\n\n173\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.390\nJust make this frame a little bit smaller.\n\n174\n00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:31.670\nAgain, I'm just grabbing the drag\nhandles to shrink up that text frame.\n\n175\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.450\nI'm gonna select that same word and\nI'm going to drag it and\n\n176\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.700\nmove it outside that frame, and\nwhoops come on let's just grab this.\n\n177\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.920\nAnd I'm gonna Cmd and\nclick on that, so Cmd, so\n\n178\n00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.620\nI get this new text frame, or\nCtrl on the PC, excuse me.\n\n179\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.830\nIf I hold down the Cmd key I can see that\nit's going to draw a new frame out for me,\n\n180\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.240\nand I'm just gonna let it go, basically\nit's gonna drop to whatever size it\n\n181\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.960\nwants to, it's always the square,\nno matter how much text you have.\n\n182\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.170\nI think that's a little annoying.\n\n183\n00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.620\nBut I was able to move that\nto a new frame entirely.\n\n184\n00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.430\nI'm gonna undo that, step back one and\nnow I'm gonna start dragging.\n\n185\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.320\nRemember, you have to do,\n\n186\n00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.870\nyou have to start the dragging first\nbefore you hit your modifier keys.\n\n187\n00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.230\nLet me start dragging, and\nwe'll hold down the Cmd key so\n\n188\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.590\nthat I get a new text frame.\n\n189\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.340\nBut I'm also gonna hold\ndown the Option key, or\n\n190\n00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.630\nthe Alt key on a PC, to copy it to\na new frame, and then I'm gonna let go.\n\n191\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.680\nAll right, so\nI can actually drag that out.\n\n192\n00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.280\nSo it's really nice if I've got\na sentence I wanna bring really quickly,\n\n193\n00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.280\nI just come over here and\nsay, okay that looks great.\n\n194\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.000\nLet's Cmd, Ctrl, Option, Alt.\n\n195\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.880\nClick over here, and\nthere we have that frame ready to go.\n\n196\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.400\nNow we can start styling it how I need to.\n\n197\n00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.300\nThat's drag and drop editing.\n\n198\n00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.260\nI'm gonna turn that off because I\nam the type who will accidentally\n\n199\n00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.310\ngrab something and drag it in my modifier\nkeys and then I'll have text and\n\n200\n00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.070\nI don't know where it moved to.\n\n201\n00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.450\nBecause when it moves it doesn't give\nyou any indication where it moved to.\n\n202\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.320\nIt just moved to wherever\nyour cursor ended up.\n\n203\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.700\nSo we're gonna turn that one off.\n\n204\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.810\nI can also do a spell check.\n\n205\n00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.830\nSo I'm gonna turn on spelling.\n\n206\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.220\nAnd this is in the preferences,\n\n207\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.950\nthis is just where we're gonna tell\nit what it looks for in spell check.\n\n208\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.010\nI can tell it to look for\nmisspelled words.\n\n209\n00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.170\nObviously, that's what spellcheck's for.\n\n210\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.470\nI can also tell it to look for\nrepeated words, this is handy.\n\n211\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.882\nI don't know if you're like me, but\nif you just lose your train of thought and\n\n212\n00:10:10.882 --> 00:10:12.980\nyou decide to type and\ntwo or three times in a row.\n\n213\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.870\nI don't know why, but it happens.\n\n214\n00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.490\nIf you have uncapitalized words,\nwords that it knows are supposed to be\n\n215\n00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.660\ncapitalized, and\nif you have uncapitalized sentences.\n\n216\n00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.370\nAnd I tend to keep those off\nbecause I do a lot of ad layouts,\n\n217\n00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.460\nthere's often uncapitalized words.\n\n218\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.370\nI do a lot of software.\n\n219\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.620\nSoftware sometimes is not capitalized\nexcept in the middle of the word.\n\n220\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.859\nIt'll suddenly have an intercap, so\n\n221\n00:10:32.859 --> 00:10:35.680\nit'll start with a lowercase and\nbe a cap in the middle of it.\n\n222\n00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.150\nAnd uncapitalized sentences\nif you're doing ad layouts,\n\n223\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.490\nyou often have not\ncomplete sentences anyway.\n\n224\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.130\nSo you don't need to worry about that.\n\n225\n00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.360\nBut you turn those on, it won't look for\nit if you don't have it checked.\n\n226\n00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.540\nAlso you can enable dynamic spelling.\n\n227\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.620\nSo actually let's, I'm gonna just\nleave dynamic off for a second and\n\n228\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.528\nshow you what spell check actually\nlooks like when we use that.\n\n229\n00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:54.760\nSo I'm gonna come over here and\n\n230\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.430\nI'm just going to select this text\nframe with the selection tool.\n\n231\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.770\nAnd I'm gonna go into spell check,\n\n232\n00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:04.316\nwhich is under the Edit menu, down under\nSpelling, and then Check Spelling, or\n\n233\n00:11:04.316 --> 00:11:08.850\nCmd+Option or Ctrl+Alt+I.\n\n234\n00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.940\nAnd I can tell it,\nwhere are we looking for the spelling?\n\n235\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.130\nWell, right now,\nI have this word selected, so\n\n236\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.870\nbasically it's just checking\nthe spelling of that one word.\n\n237\n00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:17.860\nI don't want that.\n\n238\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.770\nWe can do to the end of the story, so\nfrom where my cursor is to the end.\n\n239\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.520\nIf I choose that,\nthen it only goes from that point onward.\n\n240\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:31.100\nIf I say story, everything in that\nselected text frame will be checked.\n\n241\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.490\nEven from this point it'll go forward,\n\n242\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.910\nwhen it gets to the end it will loop\nback and make sure it does a full loop.\n\n243\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.680\nAnd checks everything in that story.\n\n244\n00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.140\nOr I can choose to do the whole document,\nand that's great, so\n\n245\n00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.010\nI don't even have to worry\nabout selecting a frame,\n\n246\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.340\nit just automatically does everything in\nthe document, or I can do all documents.\n\n247\n00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.390\nThis is not all documents that you have on\nyour computer, this is all open documents,\n\n248\n00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.820\nso if you have ten in\ndesign documents open,\n\n249\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.570\nyou can run spell check across all of\nthem at one time, which is really great.\n\n250\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.420\nSo in this case I'm just\ngonna choose story, and\n\n251\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.690\nit tells me this is not in the\ndictionaries, it's not spelled correctly.\n\n252\n00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.070\nIt is a British thing so\nmaybe it's the British spelling.\n\n253\n00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.840\nWhen it says it's not there,\n\n254\n00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.510\nwould you like to change it to\nsomething that we've suggested here.\n\n255\n00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.512\nI have to say that the in design\ndictionary is not 100% great.\n\n256\n00:12:15.512 --> 00:12:17.480\nThere are certain words\nthat it just does not know.\n\n257\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.500\nBut the great thing is\nyou can add to that.\n\n258\n00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.620\nSo, first is your name.\n\n259\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.360\nIf you're gonna have your name or\nyour website it's gonna be there a lot.\n\n260\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.518\nAdd that to the the dictionary, so\nthen it knows what to look for.\n\n261\n00:12:26.518 --> 00:12:27.700\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n262\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.560\nI can either tell it to skip,\nso it'll just skip over that.\n\n263\n00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.910\nI can tell it to ignore all,\nwhich is nice so\n\n264\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.360\nif you get something like,\nwell obviously it knows in design but\n\n265\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.880\nit doesn't know, there's one of\nthem I can't remember, apps.\n\n266\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.200\nIt still has not remembered or it\ndoesn't know that app or apps is a word.\n\n267\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.521\nAnd I type that word a lot so\nI tend to say ignore all or\n\n268\n00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:48.060\nI can add that the dictionary.\n\n269\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.906\nBut I don't want my dictionary to get so\nbloated you know, and just add everything,\n\n270\n00:12:50.906 --> 00:12:52.130\nso I just tend to ignore all.\n\n271\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.490\nAnd then as I run spell check in that\nsame document it remembers to ignore it,\n\n272\n00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.903\neven if I come back to spell check it\nremembers yeah, she said to ignore that,\n\n273\n00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:00.740\nso that's really cool.\n\n274\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.970\nOr I can go ahead and\nadd it to the dictionary, and\n\n275\n00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.760\nright now it says user dictionary.\n\n276\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.540\nYou can have extra\ndictionaries if you want.\n\n277\n00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.170\nLet's say you do a lot of medical\nterminology or website terminology, you\n\n278\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.600\ncan purchase individual dictionaries from\nplaces or you can create your own as well.\n\n279\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.880\nSo you might have,\nyou say I wanna add that but\n\n280\n00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.620\nI wanna add that to my\nInternet dictionary.\n\n281\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.860\nYou would choose that here, and in your\npreferences you have to tell it that\n\n282\n00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.290\nyou want all those other dictionaries.\n\n283\n00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.970\nMaybe you wanna load up the Spanish and\n\n284\n00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.740\nthe English dictionary because you're\ngoing to be doing text in both.\n\n285\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.270\nSo you wanna have both of\nthose available to you.\n\n286\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.590\nI can also say okay, let's change this,\nI wanna select this word and say great,\n\n287\n00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:36.350\nlet's change that.\n\n288\n00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.750\nSo I can either change it here or\nI can do Change All.\n\n289\n00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.860\nIf I know I've spelled it wrong throughout\nthe entire document, do Change All so\n\n290\n00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.710\nit doesn't hit that same\nword a million times.\n\n291\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.680\nAll right, so we can do that,\n\n292\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.150\nI'm just gonna tell it Skip on that,\nlet's add this.\n\n293\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.520\nLet's say, okay, grey,\ndoesn't like the way I spelled grey.\n\n294\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.680\nThat's the way I spell grey,\nmost of the time.\n\n295\n00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.810\nSometimes I put an A in it,\nbut in this case let's say,\n\n296\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.800\nwe wanna go ahead and\nadd this to the dictionary.\n\n297\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.230\nSo I would just click Add.\n\n298\n00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.730\nSo now grey is in that dictionary.\n\n299\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.730\nNow I probably shouldn't have done that\nbecause now that's in my dictionary.\n\n300\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.950\nI can go ahead and edit my dictionary.\n\n301\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.070\nIt's kind of difficult but I can.\n\n302\n00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.970\nBut now it's there and now it won't\nfind where I've used the two different\n\n303\n00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.100\nspellings of that in the same document.\n\n304\n00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.540\nSo I'm gonna go through there, and\nwhen I'm done, I just click Done.\n\n305\n00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.980\nBut the other thing that I can\ndo is if I don't wanna go and\n\n306\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.440\nrun spell check afterwards is I can turn\non that dynamic spelling that we saw.\n\n307\n00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.070\nI'm gonna do Cmd or Ctrl+K to bring up my\npreferences and go back to Type, sorry,\n\n308\n00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.910\nI'm not gonna go there,\nI'm gonna go to spelling, and\n\n309\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.530\nI'm gonna tell it,\nlet's enable dynamic spelling.\n\n310\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.110\nAnd this is what, if you've used Word and\nthings like that,\n\n311\n00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.930\nyou're probably used to this,\n\n312\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.370\nwhere it puts the little squiggly line\nunderneath that tells you this is wrong.\n\n313\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.680\nSo I can tell it what to look for and\nwhat color each thing needs to be.\n\n314\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.360\nI'm only doing misspelled and\nrepeated words, anyway, and so\n\n315\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.930\nI'll turn on the red and the green.\n\n316\n00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.050\nSo I'll say OK.\n\n317\n00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.770\nNow that's turned on, and\nit sees that this word Traveller, it says,\n\n318\n00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.540\nyep, I don't like that word that's there.\n\n319\n00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.200\nObviously, this is spelled wrong.\n\n320\n00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.800\nSo, I tend not to use this because I just\ndon't like all the extra color that it\n\n321\n00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.840\nadds to my document.\n\n322\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.020\nAnd it just is a little bit distracting.\n\n323\n00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.870\nSo, but, we're gonna look at that, oops.\n\n324\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.670\nSend it right off the screen, and I can\ngo ahead and fix that, or I can leave it.\n\n325\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.300\nSo I can leave it, I'm gonna say, no,\nthat's how we're spelling traveller in\n\n326\n00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.770\nthis particular document, that's how we're\ngonna leave it or I can change it, and\n\n327\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.590\nto do that I just need to put\nmy cursor inside the word and\n\n328\n00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.990\nthen I'm gonna right click or\nCtrl+click or not.\n\n329\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.330\nI'm gonna select the whole word and\nright-click or Ctrl it, click, and\n\n330\n00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.835\nI can choose the different options that we\nsaw in the same spell check dialog box,\n\n331\n00:15:28.835 --> 00:15:31.550\nit gives you the things\nwe can choose from, or\n\n332\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.830\nI can add it to the dictionary,\nor I can tell it to ignore all.\n\n333\n00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:35.910\nSo I can do it right from here.\n\n334\n00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.410\nSo let's actually just change that and\nsay OK.\n\n335\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.410\nAnd now that line goes away,\nwhich is what I like to see.\n\n336\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.620\nSo this quick and\n\n337\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.044\neasy way to visually see your mistakes,\ninstead of running spell check afterwards.\n\n338\n00:15:47.675 --> 00:15:52.510\nI'm gonna go back into the preferences\nagain, again I'm using Cmd or\n\n339\n00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.125\nCtrl+K to get into that.\n\n340\n00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:55.665\nAnd then I just find the pane that I need.\n\n341\n00:15:55.665 --> 00:15:58.553\nThe other one that I'm gonna\nwork with is called autocorrect.\n\n342\n00:15:58.553 --> 00:16:04.215\nNow if you're like me you have a lot\nof typos, but they're not really.\n\n343\n00:16:04.215 --> 00:16:06.922\nThey're not something that it's going\nto catch, because they're still words.\n\n344\n00:16:06.922 --> 00:16:09.420\nThey're just the incorrect words to use.\n\n345\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.240\nWhat the auto-correct is good for,\nand we have to turn it on.\n\n346\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.700\nIt's off by default.\n\n347\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.360\nWe enable it, and we can also tell it\nto auto-correct capitalization errors.\n\n348\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.100\nBut what it does is it says,\nhere's a common misspelling.\n\n349\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.360\nIf you're always flipping\naround your letters.\n\n350\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.530\nYou can tell it correct to this.\n\n351\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.850\nSo there's a huge list that's in here of\nthings that are already available to you.\n\n352\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.720\nBut I can come in here and\nmake specialized ones and\n\n353\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.870\nthat's what I use this for.\n\n354\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.220\nI use it as a sort of like\na shorthand dictionary.\n\n355\n00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.922\nSo, for me, I can say, I don't wanna have\nto type InDesign all the time because\n\n356\n00:16:38.922 --> 00:16:40.263\nyou've got that inter cap.\n\n357\n00:16:40.263 --> 00:16:44.322\nCapital I, lower case d, capital d and\nwhen I write about a lot of technology,\n\n358\n00:16:44.322 --> 00:16:45.872\nI've got things like Mac OS.\n\n359\n00:16:45.872 --> 00:16:48.988\nWhich has capitalized M and\nthere is a space, then there is OS and\n\n360\n00:16:48.988 --> 00:16:53.060\nthen there is space and then X, that's\njust a pain to have to type every time.\n\n361\n00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.470\nSo what I use it for is I say,\nthe mis-spelling is this thing, but\n\n362\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.170\nit corrects to Mac OS 10 or\nInDesign or whatever.\n\n363\n00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.940\nSo I can actually set up new words.\n\n364\n00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.720\nSo whether it's you're using it for\n\n365\n00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.350\nmisspelled words that you know\nyou spell wrong all the time.\n\n366\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:10.080\nOr if you want to use it as\na specialized shorthand dictionary.\n\n367\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.750\nYou need to enable the auto-correct,\nlike I said you can auto-correct\n\n368\n00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.330\ncapitalization errors if it knows it's\nsupposed to be capitalized, it will.\n\n369\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.220\nObviously at the beginning of a sentence\nit knows it needs to be capitalized.\n\n370\n00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.630\nBut if it's names that are in there,\nif it's countries,\n\n371\n00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.910\nthings like that it'll automatically\ncapitalize it for you as well.\n\n372\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.419\nSo I can come in here and say,\nin this case I have this one called qq.\n\n373\n00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:29.590\nI'm gonna actually remove that\ncuz that was still in there.\n\n374\n00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.280\nI wanna add that.\n\n375\n00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.370\nAnd I say okay, I want a shortcut\nthat I can use for InDesign.\n\n376\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.120\nSo I'm going to say Add, and\nI'm going to say the misspelled word\n\n377\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.290\nis just something I know won't\nappear in the English language.\n\n378\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.020\nSo that's why I put qq.\n\n379\n00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.620\nAnd then I'm gonna say in\nit corrects to InDesign, or\n\n380\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.820\nlet's actually make it Adobe InDesign so\nit's even longer.\n\n381\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:47.630\nSo I'll say OK.\n\n382\n00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.910\nAnd so with that enabled, what happens\nis if I type things like the word,\n\n383\n00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:57.550\nthe, and I spell it wrong,\nit will automatically change that for me.\n\n384\n00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.840\nSo you saw it squiggly for\na minute cuz it said it's wrong.\n\n385\n00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.636\nSoon as I hit the space it says,\nnope, we need to correct that.\n\n386\n00:18:02.636 --> 00:18:07.089\nAnd so I'll say the course is on.\n\n387\n00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:09.425\nThis is why I don't like the squiggly,\nbecause even as you're typing,\n\n388\n00:18:09.425 --> 00:18:11.360\nif you slow down a little bit,\nit says it's spelled wrong.\n\n389\n00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.870\nI wasn't done typing yet.\n\n390\n00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.490\nSo the course is on and\nthen I'm gonna put qq, period.\n\n391\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.540\nAnd when I do that, it auto filled\nit with the Adobe InDesign, so\n\n392\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.550\nI use that as like I say,\nshorthand a keyboard.\n\n393\n00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.490\nI'm sorry, shorthand a dictionary.\n\n394\n00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.230\nCan I actually turn that back off\nbecause if I make a mistake it's gonna\n\n395\n00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.570\nautomatically correct for me.\n\n396\n00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.760\nI'm also gonna turn off\nthe dynamic spelling.\n\n397\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.950\nSo that I have that all set.\n\n398\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.950\nSo those are just some ways to keep\nyou on track so that as you're typing,\n\n399\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.710\nyou don't have to think so\nmuch about the actual content of it.\n\n400\n00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.390\nYou can just start working with the layout\ncuz that's really what we want to\n\n401\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.150\nbe working in.\n\n402\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.810\nNow you might be bringing your\ntext in from elsewhere, and\n\n403\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:52.820\nthat spell check is really nice because\nmaybe the person giving you the text\n\n404\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.320\ndidn't do their spell check ahead of time.\n\n405\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.800\nSo you have that as well.\n\n406\n00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.249\nSo just some ways to say make\nsure you text is on track.\n\n407\n00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:05.240\nSo let's actually look at how the text\nlooks, the formatting of the text itself.\n\n408\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.920\nSo I'm gonna jump out to another\npiece of text that I have here.\n\n409\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.220\nThis is really teeny tiny, so we're gonna\nactually work with that cuz it's so tiny.\n\n410\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.160\nWe wanna make it look a little bit bigger.\n\n411\n00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.860\nSo when I'm working with text, I have\ntwo different panels that I work with.\n\n412\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.640\nThe character panel, and\nthe paragraph panel.\n\n413\n00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.373\nSo we're gonna open up both of those.\n\n414\n00:19:23.615 --> 00:19:26.478\nWe'll open up a little of this,\nlet's open up the paragraph,\n\n415\n00:19:26.478 --> 00:19:30.980\nnot the styles we just want the character\nand the paragraph panels that are there.\n\n416\n00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.990\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna move this graph to the side,\n\n417\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.010\nand this here because we\ndon't need to see everything.\n\n418\n00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.510\nI just want to see some of the text.\n\n419\n00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.680\nI'm gonna zoom in slightly to that.\n\n420\n00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.200\nAnd when I'm working with\nthe character panel that's\n\n421\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.080\neach character that we're working\nwith needs to be selected.\n\n422\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.570\nSo if I want to affect a piece of text, I\nneed to make sure all of that is selected.\n\n423\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.180\nSo I'm just gonna select some text.\n\n424\n00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.220\nI'll just drag across section of text.\n\n425\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.210\nSo all that we'll be working with\nis this particular amount of text.\n\n426\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.970\nI'm going to open my character panel,\nlike I said,\n\n427\n00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.370\nand the first thing I'm going\nto choose is probably a font.\n\n428\n00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.890\nIf we don't have it set up so\nthat default font is the font we want,\n\n429\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.340\nI'm going to choose a font from here.\n\n430\n00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.850\nWhen I choose fonts, I can use the font\npull down menu that's here, or.\n\n431\n00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.080\nI can use the one that's in the control\npanel, and the nice thing is\n\n432\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.732\nI don't have to open up this\nparagraphing character panel every time.\n\n433\n00:20:19.732 --> 00:20:24.750\nWhen I'm in the type tool, in my control\npanel I have all my character settings\n\n434\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.080\nby clicking this little\nA that's over here.\n\n435\n00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.780\nOr I can get to all\nthe paragraph settings.\n\n436\n00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.340\nBy clicking the little paragraph.\n\n437\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.780\nThat's called a pilcrow,\nin case you needed that for trivia night.\n\n438\n00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.300\nThat's what the little\nparagraph symbol is.\n\n439\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.500\nI always do it the wrong way, though.\n\n440\n00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.890\nSo, I do a backwards pilcrow, apparently.\n\n441\n00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.870\nSo, I have this, for\nthe character panel, or\n\n442\n00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.540\nI can come over to\nthe character panel itself.\n\n443\n00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.280\nAgain, it's the same exact thing.\n\n444\n00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.040\nNow if I know the name of the font\nI can just start typing it.\n\n445\n00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.250\nLet's just change it to Palatino, and\nit's Palatino Regular, let's say.\n\n446\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.570\nNow once I choose a font I can\ncome down here to the face and\n\n447\n00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.800\nI can choose a bold,\nregular bold italic, or italic.\n\n448\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.850\nNow you may be coming from something like\nWord where you can just do a keyboard\n\n449\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.170\nshortcut to make it bold.\n\n450\n00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:07.540\nIf you want something to be Paltino bold,\nwe can do that in InDesign as well.\n\n451\n00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.580\nIt's command or control shift b for bold.\n\n452\n00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:15.400\nBut InDesign is smart enough that if you\ndon't actually have Palatino Bold loaded,\n\n453\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.950\nit does not fake bold it.\n\n454\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.640\nAnd that's what other things\nlike Microsoft Word does.\n\n455\n00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.220\nIt says, you want to bold?\n\n456\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.480\nI'll just make it a little bolder,\nthat's all actually,\n\n457\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.270\nyou need the font loaded for\nit to work properly.\n\n458\n00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.240\nA bold font is just not a fatter\nversion of the regular font.\n\n459\n00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.950\nIt's actually crafted differently.\n\n460\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.960\nSo, I mean, I'm not saying I\ndon't sometimes go ahead and\n\n461\n00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.740\njust make a fake bold or fake italic\nbecause sometimes you just need for\n\n462\n00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.030\nthat one little piece of text.\n\n463\n00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.930\nBut it's a really bad typography.\n\n464\n00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.380\nBut that's probably for a whole different\nday altogether, the typography wars.\n\n465\n00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.860\nSo anyway, I can choose it if I have it,\nif not, I don't want to use it.\n\n466\n00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.890\nI'm in InDesign like I said, I can hit\nthat keyboard shortcut all I want,\n\n467\n00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.590\nif I don't have bold loaded,\nit's not going to bold it for me.\n\n468\n00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.340\nI have to actually do a work\naround to get that to happen.\n\n469\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.320\nLet's work in this font file that we have,\nlets actually come over.\n\n470\n00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.150\nI am gonna use the control\npanel over here,\n\n471\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.660\njust because it's a little higher and\neasier to see.\n\n472\n00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.670\nUnder the font, when I choose Palatino,\n\n473\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.540\nthe last ones I used are up here at\nthe top, I also have these little symbols.\n\n474\n00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.620\nI have the star symbol, and\nthat's because I can put stars by clicking\n\n475\n00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.410\nnext to any of these fonts,\nthat's my favorite.\n\n476\n00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.010\nSo, then I can filter it\nby just my favorites.\n\n477\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.080\nSo, if they're the same ten fonts used all\nthe time, and they're down at the bottom,\n\n478\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.480\nand you don't want to scroll\nthrough your thousands of fonts.\n\n479\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.780\nMake it a favorite so\nthat it's at the top.\n\n480\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.560\nYou can always turn it back off later.\n\n481\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.360\nThe other thing that you can do is\nhit this TK, and this is Typekit.\n\n482\n00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.540\nNow I'm not gonna go into\nthat a whole lot, but\n\n483\n00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.030\nTypekit is part of\nthe Creative Cloud subscription.\n\n484\n00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.420\nSo if you have Creative Cloud,\n\n485\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.552\nyou have a subscription to that,\nyou have a subscription to Typekit.\n\n486\n00:22:43.552 --> 00:22:47.010\nAnd Typekit is thousands of fonts that\nare available for you to download and\n\n487\n00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:47.760\nuse free.\n\n488\n00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.860\nIn all your projects.\n\n489\n00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.850\nBecause that's part of the subscription.\n\n490\n00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.420\nSo if you know you're using Typekit fonts,\nand\n\n491\n00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.130\nthe good thing about Typekit fonts\nis if I'm working on a project and\n\n492\n00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.660\nI'm going to send it off to Wes,\nwho's also going to work on the project.\n\n493\n00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.260\nI use a Typekit font because I know\nthat he also has the cloud, so\n\n494\n00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:07.140\nI know any font I use he\nalso has available to him.\n\n495\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.310\nSo it's a nice way to sync your fonts.\n\n496\n00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.320\nSo that being said, the reason I mention\nthat here, is that I can say I can just\n\n497\n00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.390\nclick Typekit, and only my Typekit\nfonts that I have loaded will show up.\n\n498\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.029\nIf there's ones I need,\nI can click add fonts from Typekit.\n\n499\n00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:23.460\nIt will go out to Typekit Website and\nI can say I like these, these and these,\n\n500\n00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.790\ndownload them, it automatically syncs and\nnow it's available in InDesign.\n\n501\n00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.460\nThere's lots to read up on Adobe\nsite about Typekit as well.\n\n502\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.040\nBut just know that's there and\n\n503\n00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.520\nit makes it really easy that I know\nthat everybody has that font available.\n\n504\n00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.640\nBecause as we'll see when\nwe get to exporting and\n\n505\n00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.270\npackaging of files in a later episode.\n\n506\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.420\nWe get the notice from the font police\nreminding you that you cannot actually\n\n507\n00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.630\ndistribute fonts to everybody.\n\n508\n00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:47.829\nThere's a whole copyright,\ntrademark issue in the font world.\n\n509\n00:23:47.829 --> 00:23:50.789\nSo the font police will come up and\nsay, you can't send that font to Wes.\n\n510\n00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:54.719\nYou better make sure Wes has that font and\nif I'm using Typekit, I know he's got it.\n\n511\n00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:57.004\nSo I can turn on those filters or not.\n\n512\n00:23:57.004 --> 00:24:00.010\nSo anyway, I can just scroll through,\nfind a font that I want.\n\n513\n00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.750\nWhen I find one that has one of those\narrows, I can drill down on that and\n\n514\n00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.640\nactually see which particular\nface that that is.\n\n515\n00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.640\nOr I can choose it from the menu\nin the character panel.\n\n516\n00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.700\nSome of the other things that we can do in\nthe character panel are choose your font\n\n517\n00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.700\nsize and your leading.\n\n518\n00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.310\nYou may know this as line spacing,\n\n519\n00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.500\nif you're coming from somewhere else,\nwe call it leading, not leading.\n\n520\n00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.180\nIt looks like leading, but it's leading.\n\n521\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.950\nIt's just an old, old printing term.\n\n522\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.110\nAnd that is the amount\nof space between lines.\n\n523\n00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:30.770\nBy default, it's set to auto, and auto is\nset by default to 120% of your font size.\n\n524\n00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.160\nHere's that math again, but\ndon't worry about it too much.\n\n525\n00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.670\nBut just know that if you have a 10 pt\nfont, you will have a 12 pt leading.\n\n526\n00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.550\nSo, that's 120% of that.\n\n527\n00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.605\nYou can change that default\nvalue in your preferences, and\n\n528\n00:24:43.605 --> 00:24:46.242\nyou can also change it if you like,\nthis is 14 pt.\n\n529\n00:24:46.242 --> 00:24:48.120\nI'm gonna just scroll up,\nmake it a little bit bigger.\n\n530\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.940\nAnd then I can change it, instead of the\nauto, which is 120%, I can say, actually,\n\n531\n00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.532\nI want it to be really huge leading,\nall right?\n\n532\n00:24:55.532 --> 00:24:58.020\nAnd in this case,\nleading is set per line, so\n\n533\n00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.390\nI can change the text\nthat I have selected.\n\n534\n00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:04.300\nThis has different leading than\nthe leading in the same paragraph.\n\n535\n00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.870\nYou can also change that preference\nif you want leading to be\n\n536\n00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.870\na paragraph wide setting as well.\n\n537\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.361\nAll right, so let's change the kerning.\n\n538\n00:25:12.361 --> 00:25:15.710\nThe kerning is the amount of\nspace between letter pairs.\n\n539\n00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.310\nSo I like this sample, it's a V and an A.\n\n540\n00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.816\nAnd it says great, if you have a V and\nA next to each other,\n\n541\n00:25:21.816 --> 00:25:26.713\nif it's set up to metrics, which is what\nthe option is by default, is metrics,\n\n542\n00:25:26.713 --> 00:25:29.708\nthat basically says when\nthat font was created,\n\n543\n00:25:29.708 --> 00:25:33.756\nit said the V takes up this space and\nthe A takes up this much space.\n\n544\n00:25:33.756 --> 00:25:37.108\nBut they kind of nest together well, so\nlet’s actually squish them together and\n\n545\n00:25:37.108 --> 00:25:38.560\nthat's what kerning is.\n\n546\n00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.970\nSo you can change kerning on any text by\nputting your cursor in between two letters\n\n547\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.600\nand changing the amount of kerning here.\n\n548\n00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.260\nOr what I had, is I have what's called\noptical kerning on for all my text.\n\n549\n00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.225\nIf do metrics,\nit just changes the spacing a little bit.\n\n550\n00:25:53.225 --> 00:25:56.744\nAnd optical just looks at each letter\npair and says, how do these fit together?\n\n551\n00:25:56.744 --> 00:25:59.412\nA little closer may be better,\nmaybe a little bit further apart, and\n\n552\n00:25:59.412 --> 00:26:00.240\nit looks at each one.\n\n553\n00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.589\nSo when I move my cursor through,\neach kerning value is different,\n\n554\n00:26:03.589 --> 00:26:06.700\nbecause it looked at each letter pair and\ndid that.\n\n555\n00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.110\nSo just know that you can turn that on and\n\n556\n00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.300\noff, to kind of get\na better flow to your text.\n\n557\n00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.960\nI have it set to optical, in fact I set\nit to optical with no document open.\n\n558\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.010\nI went in, chose my type tool,\ncharacter panel and said optical.\n\n559\n00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.190\nSo now every new bit of text\nI put in every new document,\n\n560\n00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.450\nautomatically has that applied.\n\n561\n00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.720\nSo I don't have to apply\nthat all the time.\n\n562\n00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.070\nThe tracking is the overall\nspacing between the letters, so\n\n563\n00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.900\nit's not individually.\n\n564\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.180\nSet that back to 0.\n\n565\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.210\nYou also have horizontal and\nvertical scaling.\n\n566\n00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.830\nWe're not gonna use that very often.\n\n567\n00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.000\nAgain, that's just messing\nup the typography.\n\n568\n00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.300\nSo I can just change the horizontal and\nvertical scaling.\n\n569\n00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.800\nI might do that in an ad,\nlike a brand name or something.\n\n570\n00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.950\nI might stretch it a little bit if\nthat's the effect I'm going for.\n\n571\n00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.220\nI'm not gonna do that in prose like this.\n\n572\n00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.248\nThe baseline shift.\n\n573\n00:26:49.248 --> 00:26:52.700\nI'm just gonna select this one word and\nmove off of the baseline shift.\n\n574\n00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.393\nSo the baseline is where your letters sit,\n\n575\n00:26:54.393 --> 00:26:57.460\nI'm just moving it off the baseline\na little bit, you can also move it below.\n\n576\n00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.900\nThis is great if you\nare doing chemical formulas,\n\n577\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.710\nobviously you want to\nmove things down below.\n\n578\n00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.990\nYou can also tell it that you want it to\nbe superscript or subscript if you want.\n\n579\n00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.985\nAnd there's a lot in the character panel,\nwe're not gonna go into everything.\n\n580\n00:27:09.985 --> 00:27:13.693\nAs you can see there's just tons of\noptions that are here, available to you,\n\n581\n00:27:13.693 --> 00:27:14.330\nto the text.\n\n582\n00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:18.190\nText could be a whole two\nday class altogether.\n\n583\n00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.160\nSo, but baseline shift, here's that\nfalse italic I was telling you about.\n\n584\n00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.343\nI can fake an italic by\nputting in a value here and\n\n585\n00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:27.180\nit just cranks everything to the side.\n\n586\n00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.440\nAgain, that's not actually italic,\nit's called false italic.\n\n587\n00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.540\nBut the one thing you do wanna make sure\nthat you have is you wanna make sure\n\n588\n00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.670\nthat you have your language set to\nthe language that the type is in.\n\n589\n00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.500\nSo obviously, it assumes it's English USA\nbecause that's what I've set up for\n\n590\n00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.420\nmy system.\n\n591\n00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.860\nHowever, I could tell it that this\nentire text is actually Spanish.\n\n592\n00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.800\nNow, it's gonna magically translate it.\n\n593\n00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.060\nNo, not really.\n\n594\n00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.530\nWas hoping, but it didn't.\n\n595\n00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.520\nBut what I've told it is it's Spanish.\n\n596\n00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.165\nNow I wanna run spellcheck, it's gonna\nsay all these words are spelled wrong,\n\n597\n00:27:58.165 --> 00:27:58.880\nmost of them.\n\n598\n00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.340\nBecause they're not Spanish words.\n\n599\n00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.530\nI'm just basically telling it what\nlanguage it is supposed to be in, so\n\n600\n00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:04.430\nthat it knows.\n\n601\n00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:09.345\nAnd also things like different\npunctuation, quotes and things like that,\n\n602\n00:28:09.345 --> 00:28:14.898\nwill be flagged as being wrong, because\nit's not in English anymore, English USA.\n\n603\n00:28:14.898 --> 00:28:19.190\nSo again, so now it knows what dictionary\nto use when we do spellcheck on that.\n\n604\n00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:22.508\nSo that's character settings, but\nwe also have paragraph settings.\n\n605\n00:28:22.508 --> 00:28:25.850\nAnd I'm gonna do what I said not to do,\nwhich is that extra return in between,\n\n606\n00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.500\nbecause what I want to have is\nthis paragraph kind of by itself.\n\n607\n00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.026\nClose the character panel and\nzoom in a little bit.\n\n608\n00:28:31.026 --> 00:28:36.063\nAnd I'm gonna zoom in a little bit more,\ncome on, there we go.\n\n609\n00:28:36.063 --> 00:28:39.360\nAnd I'm gonna work with\nthe paragraph settings now.\n\n610\n00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.970\nWhen I work with character settings,\n\n611\n00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.980\nI select all the text that needs to be,\nthat I'm trying to affect.\n\n612\n00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.080\nWhen I'm working with paragraph settings,\nI only have to have my cursor\n\n613\n00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.390\nin the paragraph, I don't need to\nselect the whole entire paragraph.\n\n614\n00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.490\nSo even though we set it up so\nwe don't have to triple-click to do it,\n\n615\n00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:55.240\nI don't have to do it and\nthat's the good thing.\n\n616\n00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.000\nSo I'm gonna put my cursor\nin the paragraph and\n\n617\n00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.730\nnow every paragraph setting I do\naffects the whole entire paragraph.\n\n618\n00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:06.110\nSo along the top of the paragraph panel\nare all these different alignment options.\n\n619\n00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.310\nAnd I'm just gonna go through each one.\n\n620\n00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:13.310\nThere's left, so we just watch this\nparagraph here, left, centered, right.\n\n621\n00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.776\nAnd then these are all justified.\n\n622\n00:29:14.776 --> 00:29:17.124\nSo it's even on both sides\nInstead of a ragged right,\n\n623\n00:29:17.124 --> 00:29:18.750\nis what we call the other ones.\n\n624\n00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.976\nIt's even on both sides but\nit's what happens to the last line.\n\n625\n00:29:21.976 --> 00:29:26.017\nCenter the last line to the right or\nthis one spaced everything out.\n\n626\n00:29:26.017 --> 00:29:28.880\nIf you notice,\nit put in a lot of extra white space.\n\n627\n00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.637\nAlso, I have several spaces\nafter punctuation here.\n\n628\n00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:34.162\nAnd this is driving me crazy,\n\n629\n00:29:34.162 --> 00:29:37.640\ncuz we all know we only want\none space after punctuation.\n\n630\n00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.330\nAlso not gonna get into that conversation.\n\n631\n00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.980\nErika said so, that's how it is.\n\n632\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.410\nBut wherever I grabbed this from,\nthey had extra spaces.\n\n633\n00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.530\nBut you can see when I set it to the\ncenter one, is not only were there already\n\n634\n00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.300\nthose spaces, but then because it wanted\nto justify that last line as well,\n\n635\n00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.360\nyou get what we call rivers of white.\n\n636\n00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.300\nYou can just kind of see these white\nrivers flowing through your text,\n\n637\n00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:56.880\nand that's not good.\n\n638\n00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.370\nSo, we wanna play with things like\nthat to scrunch it up a little bit.\n\n639\n00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:04.340\nThe other things we can do is change\nthe left and right margins, so\n\n640\n00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:09.180\nwe can bring in these margins here,\nso if I bring that in, bring that in.\n\n641\n00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.580\nSo I don't have to actually make a smaller\ntext frame to make something like, say,\n\n642\n00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.780\na pull-out quote.\n\n643\n00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.660\nI can just move in the left and\nright margins for that to work.\n\n644\n00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.480\nThe other thing that I can do\nis I can do a first-line indent.\n\n645\n00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.190\nSo let's set these both back to 0,\nlet's do that to 0.\n\n646\n00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.850\nAnd then I can do a first-line indent.\n\n647\n00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.080\nI can say, okay I would like\nthe first line to indent.\n\n648\n00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.570\nI have an extra space in here for\nsome reason, let's delete that.\n\n649\n00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:33.090\nSo I don't actually have a space,\nI can see that there's no spacing here.\n\n650\n00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.930\nIt's just this first-line indent.\n\n651\n00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.752\nSo I can say that's how much I want that\nfirst line of each new paragraph to indent\n\n652\n00:30:38.752 --> 00:30:40.534\nif I wanted, as an indention there.\n\n653\n00:30:40.534 --> 00:30:44.987\nThe other thing that I can do is I can\nmove in, if I move in my left margin,\n\n654\n00:30:44.987 --> 00:30:48.553\nI can move out my first-line\nindent to a negative value,\n\n655\n00:30:48.553 --> 00:30:53.650\nout to where it hits the edge of the frame\nand it will tell me when I hit the edge.\n\n656\n00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.330\nBut I can do hanging punctuation as well.\n\n657\n00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.570\nMaybe we want our bullets hanging\noutside of the text there.\n\n658\n00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.240\nBut it doesn't have to actually\nhang outside the frame,\n\n659\n00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.480\nyou just scrunch in the margins and\nthen do that first-line indent outwards.\n\n660\n00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.690\nSo, I've set all these back to 0 as well,\njust so we're back to where we had it.\n\n661\n00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.490\nAnd here's where I said don't do\nthese extra extra returns, right?\n\n662\n00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.560\nWe don't want these extra returns here.\n\n663\n00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.280\nBut I want some breathing room.\n\n664\n00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.290\nThe reason I don't want\nthat extra return is that\n\n665\n00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:21.130\nif that extra return is actually there,\nthat hard return.\n\n666\n00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:24.922\nAnd then this paragraph moves\nto the top of a new frame,\n\n667\n00:31:24.922 --> 00:31:29.968\nmaybe on a new page or just a new frame,\nthat extra return will go with it.\n\n668\n00:31:29.968 --> 00:31:32.590\nAnd sometimes you'll have that extra\nreturn at the top of the frame.\n\n669\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.551\nWell, if I manually delete it, that's\ngreat until it maybe flows backwards if\n\n670\n00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:38.820\ntext changes, text flows backwards.\n\n671\n00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.312\nNow I don't have that breathing\nroom in between the paragraph.\n\n672\n00:31:41.312 --> 00:31:44.792\nSo what we want to do is delete those\nhard returns that are there and\n\n673\n00:31:44.792 --> 00:31:48.526\ntell it in the paragraph, we wanna say,\nput some extra space before or\n\n674\n00:31:48.526 --> 00:31:51.340\nafter the paragraph,\nhowever you want to set it up.\n\n675\n00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.905\nKeep in mind that if I have the one\nbefore has space afterwards, and\n\n676\n00:31:54.905 --> 00:31:57.897\nthis one has space before,\nthose two values will add and\n\n677\n00:31:57.897 --> 00:32:00.842\nthere will be a bigger gap\nthan you might be expecting.\n\n678\n00:32:00.842 --> 00:32:03.982\nBut I add that there and then that way,\nthat's a It's a contextual space.\n\n679\n00:32:03.982 --> 00:32:07.660\nIf it needs to be there, if there's two\nparagraphs near each other, it's there.\n\n680\n00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.060\nIf it moves to the next page,\nit goes away.\n\n681\n00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.810\nSo it's smart, it knows that.\n\n682\n00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.200\nSo I'm clicking in this paragraph here and\n\n683\n00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.320\nI'm gonna use the space before or\nspace after.\n\n684\n00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.300\nIn this case,\nI'm gonna do space before and\n\n685\n00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.380\nI'm just gonna add a little\nbit of extra space.\n\n686\n00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.450\nAnd as I do that,\nit actually added that extra space.\n\n687\n00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.740\nBut if I select that text, I can see\nthere's not an actual space there.\n\n688\n00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.340\nIt's like I say,\n\n689\n00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:31.090\nit's contextual, if that paragraph\ngoes away that space also goes away.\n\n690\n00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:36.530\nAnd the great thing is, in a later\nepisode we're gonna look at text styles.\n\n691\n00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.600\nAnd we're gonna build this in, so I don't\nhave to do this for every paragraph.\n\n692\n00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.300\nI'm gonna build it once and I'm gonna\ncreate a style that has that built in.\n\n693\n00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.890\nAll the stuff will be built in,\nand so when I go to style it,\n\n694\n00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.670\nI just click on Style and\nall those magically happen.\n\n695\n00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.330\nSo that's what we're building to.\n\n696\n00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.960\nSo right now it seems like a lot\nof work to do it, and it is, but\n\n697\n00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.730\nonce you set it up as a style then\nit's automatic and it's just great.\n\n698\n00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.330\nSo I can do space before or after.\n\n699\n00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.550\nOne trick that you can do if I know that\nthis spacing, let's say this, I'm gonna go\n\n700\n00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.380\nback to the character styling, and\nlet's look at the line spacing.\n\n701\n00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.420\nI'm gonna make it 18 point just so\nit's a nice even value.\n\n702\n00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.790\nIf I come back to the paragraph settings\nhere and I want my space after or\n\n703\n00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:17.950\nspace before to look like one full return,\nI can come in here, instead\n\n704\n00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:24.020\nof putting an inch value I can say, I want\nit to be 18 pt, and that's 18 points.\n\n705\n00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.000\nIt will change it to inches for me,\nwhich happens to be 1/4 of an inch.\n\n706\n00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.140\nSo I actually have what\nlooks like one hard return.\n\n707\n00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.850\nI could do the same thing here.\n\n708\n00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.550\nLet's actually do it to\nthis second paragraph, so\n\n709\n00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.040\nthis is a whole new paragraph,\ncuz I did a hard return.\n\n710\n00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.440\nAnd let's tell it that we want it\nto be that quarter of an inch,\n\n711\n00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:38.960\nwhich is 18 point.\n\n712\n00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:45.090\nAnd now it looks like a hard return but\nthere isn't actually a hard return there.\n\n713\n00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:48.390\nLast two things on paragraph\nis I have drop caps,\n\n714\n00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:52.250\nlet's actually do this paragraph down here\nso I have a nice drop cap to look at.\n\n715\n00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:56.680\nSo I can tell it that the drop cap over\nhere is how many lines, obviously,\n\n716\n00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.900\none line doesn't do anything,\nbecause it's just a regular character.\n\n717\n00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.260\nI'm gonna say two, and now I have\na two line drop cap, a three line and\n\n718\n00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.154\nI could also choose how many characters\nthey needed to be the drop cap.\n\n719\n00:34:07.154 --> 00:34:09.625\nProbably won't use that very often,\nbut we might.\n\n720\n00:34:09.625 --> 00:34:10.825\nWe might do each one separately and\n\n721\n00:34:10.825 --> 00:34:13.515\nsay we just want the first word to\nalways be in drop cap settings.\n\n722\n00:34:13.515 --> 00:34:14.295\nI can do that as well.\n\n723\n00:34:15.565 --> 00:34:18.565\nAnd then we can choose whether or\nnot to hyphenate that paragraph.\n\n724\n00:34:18.565 --> 00:34:21.255\nSo I can choose hyphenate,\nI can turn that off which means there's\n\n725\n00:34:21.255 --> 00:34:24.980\nabsolutely no hyphenation which\non a ragged right isn't that bad.\n\n726\n00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.840\nI'm actually going to\nselect these paragraphs.\n\n727\n00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.190\nI said when I'm working on paragraphs,\nI only need my cursor in the paragraph,\n\n728\n00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.810\nwell, if I wanna work with\ntwo different paragraphs or\n\n729\n00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.210\nmultiple, I just need to have a little\nbit of each of the paragraphs set.\n\n730\n00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.670\nSo I can do that and\nI can turn on hyphenate, or off.\n\n731\n00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.940\nI'm going to turn that off,\nand when I justify that text.\n\n732\n00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.440\nTurning off hyphenation really\ngives me those rivers of white,\n\n733\n00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.010\nbecause it absolutely has to fit on that\nline, there's no way for it to hyphenate.\n\n734\n00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:52.990\nSo, I can turn off hyphenation,\nturn that on or\n\n735\n00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.720\noff, and I have a little bit\nmore control over hyphenation\n\n736\n00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.270\nif I go to the paragraph panel menu and\nI choose hyphenation.\n\n737\n00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:04.660\nAnd I can really just get into how\nmuch which hyphenation there is and\n\n738\n00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.930\nwhere that happens.\n\n739\n00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:10.040\nSo that check box that I just\ndid only gives me on or off,\n\n740\n00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.485\nthis gives me a slider.\n\n741\n00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:14.310\nAnd anybody that's old enough\nto know what this means,\n\n742\n00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:15.760\nthis is called the Nygil slider,\n\n743\n00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.590\nany guess why it's called the Nygil slider\n>> Maybe the person\n\n744\n00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.820\nthat invented it names is Nygil?\n\n745\n00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.420\n>> No, it goes to 11.\n\n746\n00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.450\nThere are 11 spots on this slider and\n\n747\n00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:26.260\nif you understand that reference well,\nwelcome to my world.\n\n748\n00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.580\nSo the slider what it is,\nin the middle right now,\n\n749\n00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.820\nis kind of the best of both worlds.\n\n750\n00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.950\nBut I can either say I\nwant better spacing,\n\n751\n00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:38.199\nif I turn on preview, better spacing, is\ngonna give me more hyphens, most likely.\n\n752\n00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.860\nObviously, fewer hyphens, maybe down to\nzero but my spacing's not as good, so you\n\n753\n00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.980\nkind of want to find the happy medium and\nthe middle is the happy medium for that.\n\n754\n00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.530\nI can tell it how many words there\nhas to be before there's a break.\n\n755\n00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.620\nLike I said, there's a ton of\ndifferent options in here.\n\n756\n00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.020\nI'm not gonna go over all of them but\n\n757\n00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.030\nif you're really into hyphenation, this\nis where the magic happens for that, and\n\n758\n00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.480\nI can choose what does and\ndoes not get hyphenated.\n\n759\n00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.800\nSo we can get into that even more in that.\n\n760\n00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.150\nSo that's kind of some of the things with\ntext, how to format what it looks like,\n\n761\n00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:09.000\nhow to format, remember with the Character\nPanel or when you're character styling?\n\n762\n00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.560\nYou need to select the character,\nit's the type itself.\n\n763\n00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.590\nIf you're working with paragraph\nyou only need to have your cursor\n\n764\n00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:18.250\nin the paragraph because those\nsettings affect the entire paragraph.\n\n765\n00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:22.839\n>> I like the dynamic three-o there,\nthe dynamic spelling,\n\n766\n00:36:22.839 --> 00:36:26.160\nthe auto-correct and the spell checker.\n\n767\n00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.760\nI could see me using every one of\nthose when we're dealing with text.\n\n768\n00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.920\nNow I know we got some future episodes\ncoming up where we're gonna go into text\n\n769\n00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.330\nmore, but does looks like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode, but before we\n\n770\n00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.710\nsign out do you have any additional\nwords you'd like to say in this episode?\n\n771\n00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.052\n>> Nope, just get ready cuz there's more.\n\n772\n00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:40.890\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, well,\n\n773\n00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.750\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou in those episodes.\n\n774\n00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.960\nWe look forward to seeing you, too.\n\n775\n00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.990\nSigning out for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryant.\n\n776\n00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.958\n>> And I'm Erica Gamut.\n\n777\n00:36:47.958 --> 00:36:49.780\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n778\n00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:57.077\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:18.495\nI'm your host, Wes Byran and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n4\n00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:20.821\nSeries in the Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.140\nThat's right,\ncoming back at you with more InDesign.\n\n6\n00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.930\nAnd joining me in the studios\ntoday again is Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.865\nErica, how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:28.830\n>> I\"m doing great, thanks.\n\n9\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.370\n>> All right, great,\n\n10\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.530\nwell this journey that we've been on\nbefore has taken us all over the place.\n\n11\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.690\nWhere are we going next?\n\n12\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.230\n>> We are gonna work with more text.\n\n13\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.590\nWe're gonna start looking\nat some special characters.\n\n14\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.410\nAnd just see what those are, right?\n\n15\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.240\nSo special characters and\nspecial helper characters.\n\n16\n00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.810\nSo I'm just gonna open\nup a text file here.\n\n17\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.700\nAnd let's look at some text.\n\n18\n00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.140\nI don't know, I've just got house of\nUsher, that's cheery, let's go with that.\n\n19\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.650\nI've got Dracula if this\ngets too depressing for us.\n\n20\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.120\nAll right, so I'm gonna come in here and\njust look at some text.\n\n21\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.740\nAnd we're gonna look at,\nlike I said, special characters.\n\n22\n00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.050\nSo there's just sort of a huge collection\nof characters that either do something\n\n23\n00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.330\nspecial or they're hidden,\nwe can't see them.\n\n24\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.010\nSo that's what we're gonna look at first,\nactually.\n\n25\n00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.120\nWe're just gonna look at something\ncalled hidden characters, or invisibles.\n\n26\n00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.280\nAnd basically, that's just so\n\n27\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.300\nthat it tells us what it's\ndoing behind the scenes.\n\n28\n00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.930\nSo sometimes you might look at something\nand think, why does it look like that?\n\n29\n00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.360\nOr I mentioned in a previous episode\nabout not wanting to have these double\n\n30\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.870\nspaces after punctuation.\n\n31\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.040\nBut I can look at that and say,\nthat looks like a lot of space.\n\n32\n00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.880\nBut I don't want to have to come in here\nand go one, two, yes there are two spaces.\n\n33\n00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.720\nI can actually turn on my invisible so\nI can see that there are two spaces, and\n\n34\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.340\nit just makes it visually easier for\nme to see that.\n\n35\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.210\nSo I'm gonna go up under the Type menu and\ncome down to Show Hidden Characters, or\n\n36\n00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.720\nuse my keyboard shortcut for that.\n\n37\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.100\nWhat I usually do.\n\n38\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.510\nAnd I can look and\nsee that there are extra spaces.\n\n39\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.060\nNow this is interesting because\nthis space character is just a dot.\n\n40\n00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.520\nBut I've got this dot with\nthis carrot thing over it.\n\n41\n00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.340\nThat means it's a special kind of space,\nand\n\n42\n00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.820\nwe're gonna look at the different\nwhite spaces in just a minute.\n\n43\n00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.460\nSo for whatever reason this has\na regular space and this does not.\n\n44\n00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.060\nAgain this text is just something\nthat I got off the Internet just some\n\n45\n00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.300\npublic domain text.\n\n46\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.160\nAnd so for whatever reason\nthat's how it was formatted.\n\n47\n00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.240\nSo I can look at and\ngo okay, that's crazy.\n\n48\n00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.640\nThat's also gonna slow me down if\nI were just doing say a find and\n\n49\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.460\nI said find space, space.\n\n50\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.650\nI'm looking for those double spaces\nto get rid of them automatically it's\n\n51\n00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.790\nnot gonna find that because\nthat's a special kind of space.\n\n52\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.340\nI also can look at the end of\na paragraph and I can see my paragraph,\n\n53\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.371\nmy turn character there as well.\n\n54\n00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:32.275\nAnd it says okay that's an end character.\n\n55\n00:02:32.275 --> 00:02:34.330\nI can see the extra returns here.\n\n56\n00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.590\nIf I had something like a tab which\nI'm gonna cover in just a few minutes,\n\n57\n00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.820\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nhit my Tab key and tab that in.\n\n58\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.450\nThat's what a tab looks like, so I could\nsee that's a tab, that's not space,\n\n59\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.300\nthat's why that doesn't work right.\n\n60\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.140\nOr if you've gotten something\nthat you think is tabbed and\n\n61\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.290\nyou're like why do the tabbed columns\nnot line up very well, and you look and\n\n62\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.130\njust the person who gave it to you\nactually did spaces all the way across.\n\n63\n00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.520\nThat happens to me more times than I would\nlike to admit and so I look at that and\n\n64\n00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.040\ngo that's because there's no tabs,\nnow I know I can add a tab in there.\n\n65\n00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.430\nSo, those are my invisibles so\nI can keep tabs, if you will,\n\n66\n00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.300\non everything that's in them, right?\n\n67\n00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.940\nSo, that's a special character.\n\n68\n00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.310\nIt's a hidden character.\n\n69\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.190\nThere's also something called glyphs.\n\n70\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.520\nAnd I'm gonna open up a new page for this.\n\n71\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.760\nAdd a new text frame.\n\n72\n00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.310\nSo glyphs are actually any\ncharacter that is inside a font,\n\n73\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.320\nwhether that's letters or\nnumbers or special characters.\n\n74\n00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.390\nYou've got your currency symbols,\nyou've got mathematical symbols,\n\n75\n00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.770\nyou've got Greek symbols.\n\n76\n00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.530\nIf you've got dingbats,\nthey're just all the little pictures,\n\n77\n00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.750\nyou've got your planes, and your apples,\nand everything that's in there,\n\n78\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.830\nall the little emoji looking things.\n\n79\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.220\nSo those are called glyphs any\ncharacter is called a glyph.\n\n80\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.430\nAnd sometimes you need a special glyph and\n\n81\n00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.550\nyou don't know where it\nlives on the keyboard.\n\n82\n00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.100\nYou can use the glyphs panel for that.\n\n83\n00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.680\nI'm going to actually turn off my\ninvisibles because I, right now,\n\n84\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.410\nI see the hash sign that's there.\n\n85\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.270\nThat tells me that's the end of my story.\n\n86\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.760\nI'm gonna turn that off so\nI don't see that actually.\n\n87\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.980\nAnd keep in mind if you turn on those\ninvisibles you have to actually be in\n\n88\n00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.870\nPreview mode, I'm sorry not in\npreview mode, in normal mode.\n\n89\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.840\nSo you can see all those behind the\nscenes, if you have normal mode turned on\n\n90\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.910\nyou won't see those cuz that\ndoesn’t show any nonprinting items.\n\n91\n00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.620\nAll right, so I turned those back off,\nso I don’t see those and\n\n92\n00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.450\nI wanna put in some special glyphs\nmaybe I'm doing a pricing catalog.\n\n93\n00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.835\nAnd I know it's a $1,99 in US currency.\n\n94\n00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:19.700\nWell I know where the dollar\nsymbol is on there.\n\n95\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.420\nLet's say I also wanna put in my British\npricing and I believe, no that's cents.\n\n96\n00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.290\nSee, that's the thing.\n\n97\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.760\nI'm never gonna remember where it is.\n\n98\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.450\nThat's okay.\n\n99\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.060\nIt's gonna be.\nI can never remember where my keyboard\n\n100\n00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.090\nshortcut is for that.\n\n101\n00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.980\nWhich is good, cuz I'm gonna\nshow you how to do it in glyphs.\n\n102\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.700\nI thought I could remember where pounds\nwas and I was gonna show you where yens is\n\n103\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.390\nbut apparently I've gotta\nshow you where pounds is too.\n\n104\n00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.300\nBut that's okay I'm\njust gonna go ahead and\n\n105\n00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.040\nput in the values right now and\nwe'll worry about the symbols in a second.\n\n106\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.520\nAll right so I'll come over here and\nI'll do 2.99.\n\n107\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.500\nObviously I have no idea what\nthe conversion rate is on any of these but\n\n108\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.850\nI want to put the pound symbol here.\n\n109\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.235\nSo let's actually make this 4.99.\n\n110\n00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:56.765\nSo I'm gonna put the pound symbol,\n\n111\n00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:59.830\nI need to put my cursor where\nI want that character to go.\n\n112\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.560\nThen go up to the Window menu,\nthis is where,\n\n113\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.870\nremember most of our panels live here,\nalmost all of them live here.\n\n114\n00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.650\nAnd I'm gonna come down to Type and\nTables.\n\n115\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.570\nBasically, if it has to do with type\nit probably is in this submenu.\n\n116\n00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.930\nThere's a couple that aren't but\nmost of them are.\n\n117\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.700\nSo come in here and I'll choose Glyphs.\n\n118\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.017\nSo now when I do that I\nget this Glyphs panel, and\n\n119\n00:05:20.017 --> 00:05:24.505\nthis entire panel shows me everything\nthat this font has to offer.\n\n120\n00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:28.425\nSo it's automatically in the font that\nI've chosen, which is my act of grotesque.\n\n121\n00:05:28.425 --> 00:05:30.645\nAnd I can choose a different\nfont if I want to.\n\n122\n00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:34.235\nMaybe in this case, I know I want to throw\nin a wing ding or something like that,\n\n123\n00:05:34.235 --> 00:05:35.905\none of the zap dingbat or something.\n\n124\n00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:37.520\nBut in this case I'm gonna leave it as is.\n\n125\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.730\nI'm just going to click out of that.\n\n126\n00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.690\nAnd I can say show entire font, so\n\n127\n00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.350\nthis shows me every glyph that's\navailable in this particular font.\n\n128\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.670\nSo here I've got all\nmy foreign characters.\n\n129\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.790\nSo this is great if you're typing in,\nsay, maybe you're typing in Swedish or\n\n130\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.170\nSpanish or something like that,\nyou don't have to switch to that keyboard.\n\n131\n00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.540\nNow, if you know\nthe language really well and\n\n132\n00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.190\nyou're typing a lot in another language.\n\n133\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.020\nYou should probably use one of\nthe keyboard switching applications that\n\n134\n00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.090\nlet's you,\ngives you remapping of the entire keys.\n\n135\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.260\nBut if I'm typing in Spanish or\njust somebody who has a Spanish last name.\n\n136\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.870\nI'm gonna type in,\nI know what the keyboard shortcut is for\n\n137\n00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.890\nsay the o with the accent above it.\n\n138\n00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.730\nAnd so I can key that in.\n\n139\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.020\nBut if I don't know what it is Is.\n\n140\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.570\nI can use the glyphs panel.\n\n141\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.350\nSo I can just scroll through and\ntry to find it if I want.\n\n142\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.920\nIf it's got a lot of special characters\nlike this one absolutely does,\n\n143\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.290\nthen that's gonna take me a long time.\n\n144\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.810\nI can also choose a subset from here and\nsay,\n\n145\n00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.060\nokay let's just find\nall the Greek symbols.\n\n146\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.850\nSo that's all the Greek symbols\nthat are available in this font.\n\n147\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.110\nI can also do mathematical symbols,\nI can also do currency.\n\n148\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.720\nSo that's what we're looking for\nis actually currency and\n\n149\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.730\nnow there's all my currency symbols\nthat are built into this font.\n\n150\n00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.440\nNow some fonts don't have this many,\nthis has quite a few,\n\n151\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.100\nI don't even know what half of those are.\n\n152\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.020\nBut the great thing is,\n\n153\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.022\nI know that I can use this font,\nif I have a lot of currency.\n\n154\n00:06:52.022 --> 00:06:54.600\nAnd that's something to think\nabout when you're using a font or\n\n155\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.080\npurchasing a font, is,\ndoes it have all the symbols you need?\n\n156\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.470\nSome fonts are really basic and\n\n157\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.040\nthey don't have even, they have\nonly one ampersand and that's it.\n\n158\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.100\nThey might not even nice looking\npunctuation, you gotta check that and\n\n159\n00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.490\nsee if it's something you're gonna need.\n\n160\n00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.205\nSo, If am gonna do something with a lot of\ncurrency, I might choose this font because\n\n161\n00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:14.610\napparently,it has a lot\nof currency symbols.\n\n162\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.490\nBut there's the pound symbol\nthat we're looking for.\n\n163\n00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.370\nI've got my cursor\nsitting where I want it.\n\n164\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.860\nI'm just gonna double click on that and\n\n165\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.890\nit's gonna throw the pound symbol\nright into that text that's in there.\n\n166\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.620\nI could do the same thing here, let's\nmake this the euro, and do like that,\n\n167\n00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.630\nthere we go, there's the euro.\n\n168\n00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.470\nAnd I just double click and\nthere's my euro.\n\n169\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.300\nNow as I'm doing that,\n\n170\n00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.020\nit's adding it to the top, because these\nare my recently used glyphs that are here.\n\n171\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.290\nSo you can see I used\nsome in different fonts.\n\n172\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.780\nI used a Webding here,\nI've got kind of a scripty font here,\n\n173\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.240\nI've got who knows what here, these\nare just one's that I've used recently.\n\n174\n00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.920\nBut the great thing is, I can actually\nchange, or create a whole new set so\n\n175\n00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.650\nI can use those again and again.\n\n176\n00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.075\nSo if I don't have one that's just\ncurrency I could actually create one by\n\n177\n00:07:53.075 --> 00:07:54.077\ncreating glyph set.\n\n178\n00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:57.738\nSo over on the panel menu, the glyph\npanel menu, I can say go ahead and\n\n179\n00:07:57.738 --> 00:08:00.025\nchoose a new glyph set and\ngive that a name.\n\n180\n00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:02.865\nI'll call this currency.\n\n181\n00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:05.715\nI don't know, I probably have five of\nthem already called that, but we'll see.\n\n182\n00:08:05.715 --> 00:08:06.605\nCurrency there.\n\n183\n00:08:06.605 --> 00:08:10.360\nAnd so when I choose one,\nI can just add that to that set.\n\n184\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.214\nSo I can say add it to the Glyph Set,\nCurrency 5.\n\n185\n00:08:14.214 --> 00:08:16.092\nAnd I can do the same thing,\nI'll add the cents, so\n\n186\n00:08:16.092 --> 00:08:17.996\nI don't have to remember\nwhere that key is either.\n\n187\n00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:19.730\nSo add that to Currency 5.\n\n188\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.980\nSo then what I can do is\nI can come over here and\n\n189\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.250\njust view a specific Glyph Set and\nall I'll see are those.\n\n190\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.190\nAnd those are in the font that I had.\n\n191\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.610\nSo I might have a currency set that has\nthe dollar sign in three different fonts.\n\n192\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.850\nSo if I'm gonna use three different\nfonts throughout my document,\n\n193\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.410\nI wanna make sure I have the right one.\n\n194\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.762\nObviously the dollar sign I can find.\n\n195\n00:08:38.762 --> 00:08:42.286\nBut let's say it's that pound sign\nthat I can't find or it's a Euro or\n\n196\n00:08:42.286 --> 00:08:46.080\nit's a Yen and I don't even know if\nthere's a keyboard shortcut for that.\n\n197\n00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.710\nI can put that in there, but I have\nit in three different fonts as well.\n\n198\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.770\nAnd it's there and easy for me to access.\n\n199\n00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.290\nCuz when I click on each one, it's gonna\ntell me down below what that font is so\n\n200\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.740\nI can make sure I'm using the right one\nthat matches the text where my cursor is.\n\n201\n00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.550\nSo basically, yeah,\nany glyph that you need,\n\n202\n00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.690\nthat you wanna see if it's in a font,\ngo ahead and turn that on.\n\n203\n00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.030\nLet's click the entire font.\n\n204\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.787\nAnd again, I can look through it and\nsay, yeah,\n\n205\n00:09:06.787 --> 00:09:09.660\nhere's some of the built-in fractions.\n\n206\n00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.111\nSo if you need a fraction that's in there,\nsome of the fonts actually include\n\n207\n00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:16.949\nfractions because what you'll see is that\nwe can't always do fractions in any font.\n\n208\n00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:19.041\nWe don't get the nice numerator and\n\n209\n00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:21.840\ndenominator put together\nnicely on the slash.\n\n210\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.748\nSo again, a good font will have\nthose built in there as well.\n\n211\n00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:29.570\nSo that's glyphs, that's how we get\nto special characters we can't find.\n\n212\n00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.400\nIf we do know where they are, some of\nthem have a menu option available too,\n\n213\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.510\nif you can't remember\nthe keyword shortcut.\n\n214\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.020\nSo for instance, you saw me\naccidentally type the trademark symbol.\n\n215\n00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.160\nThat's actually one that I can\nget to from the Type menu.\n\n216\n00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.910\nSo under the Type menu,\n\n217\n00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.650\nI'm gonna come down to Insert Special\nCharacter and then I've got Symbols.\n\n218\n00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.896\nSo there's bullet character,\n\n219\n00:09:46.896 --> 00:09:50.685\nlike the bullet you could do on\na Mac at least is pretty easy.\n\n220\n00:09:50.685 --> 00:09:52.412\nI know in PC, it used to be difficult.\n\n221\n00:09:52.412 --> 00:09:54.570\nYou had to use the alt key or\nI don't remember,\n\n222\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.350\nthey had to use a numerical keypad.\n\n223\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.000\nI know you don't anymore.\n\n224\n00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.430\nBut so I can get to that easily,\nI can say, I want the copyright symbol.\n\n225\n00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.310\nI can't remember where that\nlives on the keyboard.\n\n226\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.460\nMaybe I wanted the trademark\nsignal instead,\n\n227\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.700\ncome back down to special characters,\nSymbols, and use the Trademark Symbol.\n\n228\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.650\nAll right, so I have those available to\nme and those are just ones that are used\n\n229\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.820\na lot so I don't have to go to\nthe Glyphs panel for those.\n\n230\n00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.420\nSo again,\njust the more special ones that are here.\n\n231\n00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.100\nLet's jump back to some text here and\n\n232\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.040\nI'm gonna look at some more\nwhite space that's there.\n\n233\n00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.210\nSo I said, I have these weird\nwhite space characters here.\n\n234\n00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.190\nLet me zoom in, oops,\n\n235\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:35.430\na little bit, not too much we don't\nwant it to be huge text here.\n\n236\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.810\nAnd I want to change the spacing, but\n\n237\n00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.020\nmaybe I don't want it to be\na regular space bar space.\n\n238\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.590\nSo again, I selected all the text or\nall the characters that are there,\n\n239\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.920\nwhich are two space characters.\n\n240\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.380\nOne was that odd one.\n\n241\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.140\nI am going to delete that and\nthen just type in one space character.\n\n242\n00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.290\nAnd I don't have to delete it first.\n\n243\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.380\nI just did that for demonstration.\n\n244\n00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.790\nBut I've got just a space bar space.\n\n245\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.880\nBut maybe I don't want just that.\n\n246\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.950\nMaybe I want it to be\na little bit more but\n\n247\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.340\nI don't want it to be that double space\nbecause that double space can break.\n\n248\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.700\nIf it ends at the end,\nyou've got the double space,\n\n249\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.600\nit might have a space at the end and\nthen break it again.\n\n250\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.250\nIt can and mess up your hyphenation and\nyour text flow.\n\n251\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.410\nBut maybe I want something that's a little\nbit bigger than a regular space bar space.\n\n252\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.630\nUp under the Type menu,\ndown under Insert White Space,\n\n253\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.580\nyou have several different\nspaces to choose from.\n\n254\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.985\nAnd trust me, we don't know\nwhat half of these are either.\n\n255\n00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:26.138\nSo we always joke that, when's the last\ntime you used a quarter space?\n\n256\n00:11:26.138 --> 00:11:28.070\nI don't know,\nI don't know what that's for.\n\n257\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.890\nProbably someone who's really into\ntypography yelling at me right now because\n\n258\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.320\nthey know what it's for.\n\n259\n00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.260\nI'd love to hear it.\n\n260\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.550\nBut there's a lot of difference spaces.\n\n261\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.590\nI use Hair Space a lot because sometimes\nyou just want that thin space, for\n\n262\n00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.130\ninstance, on the either side of an dash.\n\n263\n00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.690\nSo in US English, you're not supposed to\nhave any space on the side of an dash.\n\n264\n00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.678\nThat bothers me a little bit, so sometimes\nI'll just squeeze in that Hair Space.\n\n265\n00:11:47.678 --> 00:11:50.209\nGives me a little bit breathing room, but\n\n266\n00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:53.840\ndoesn't offend the typography\nfriends of mine very much.\n\n267\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.100\nI just sneak it in there.\n\n268\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.870\nThat's what the Thin Space or\nthe Hair Space is for.\n\n269\n00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.030\nWe also have the M Space and the N Space.\n\n270\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.170\nSo in this case, maybe I want an N Space\nat the beginning of a sentence.\n\n271\n00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.960\nProbably again, not typographically\ncorrect but I'm gonna do it anyway.\n\n272\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.450\nI'm gonna put in this N Space.\n\n273\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.740\nSo the N Space is the width of the letter\nN in whatever font you're using.\n\n274\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.560\nSo it gave me that wide space but\nit's only one character.\n\n275\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.950\nAll right, so\nthat's something we might use.\n\n276\n00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:25.362\nSo those space characters come in super,\nsuper handy.\n\n277\n00:12:25.362 --> 00:12:30.145\nLet's see, some of the other options that\nwe have down here are Special Characters.\n\n278\n00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:32.960\nWe have special Hyphens and Dashes.\n\n279\n00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.480\nSo again, if you want the M Dash or\nthe N Dash,\n\n280\n00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.090\ninstead of using a hyphen, you should\nuse an M Dash or an N Dash like here.\n\n281\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.000\nAgain, this is a British text,\nthey have a space.\n\n282\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.930\nAnd I come in here and choose Insert\nSpecial Character and we do Hyphens and\n\n283\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.520\nDashes and I might put an M Dash in there.\n\n284\n00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.610\nSo I've got my nice wide\nM Dash that's there.\n\n285\n00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.046\nActually, I don't know if that\nbelongs there cuz I didn't really read\n\n286\n00:12:55.046 --> 00:12:55.584\nthe sentence.\n\n287\n00:12:55.584 --> 00:12:59.630\nAnd I don't really know what the context\nis but we can change that there with that.\n\n288\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.860\nAll right, so those are just some\nof the Special Characters and\n\n289\n00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.850\nif we can't find them,\nlook down in that menu and that's there.\n\n290\n00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.640\nOne of the other things that we can\ndo is we can add what's called a no\n\n291\n00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.660\nbreak character.\n\n292\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.290\nLet's come down here.\n\n293\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.860\nSo I've got this left justified text and\nI have some hyphenation, not too much.\n\n294\n00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.330\nBut I might look at this word and go,\nI never want this word before to break.\n\n295\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.350\nAll right, so I could have set\nthat up in my hyphenation but\n\n296\n00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.960\nmaybe it's just a special word,\nmaybe it's a name.\n\n297\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.540\nIt's French, it's [FOREIGN].\n\n298\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.050\nNo, it's Italian.\n\n299\n00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.000\nSo I can put that in there and it's\na name and I don't want it to ever break.\n\n300\n00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.700\nI might not want my name to break.\n\n301\n00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.730\nAnd it doesn't recognize it as a name,\nso it doesn't know how to hyphenate it.\n\n302\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.150\nSo it just throws in where\nit thinks it belongs.\n\n303\n00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.580\nBut I might say never do that.\n\n304\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.600\nSo let's change that.\n\n305\n00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.360\nSo I'm gonna come over to the character\npanel and up under the character panel\n\n306\n00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.150\nmenu, move this out of the way a little,\nso my menu pops out here.\n\n307\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.760\nI can actually choose no break.\n\n308\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.055\nWhen I tell it no break,\nit now didn't break.\n\n309\n00:13:53.055 --> 00:13:56.550\nNow because I have left\njustified text it's not so bad.\n\n310\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.230\nIf I had justified text,\n\n311\n00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.280\ntelling it no break might just stretch\nout the letters a little bit too much.\n\n312\n00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.320\nBut InDesign is smart,\nit didn't just look at everything\n\n313\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.570\nafter that space to figure out\nhow to readjust everything.\n\n314\n00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.010\nIt looks at the entire paragraph.\n\n315\n00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:11.900\nSo if you break something here,\nit doesn't just say, okay,\n\n316\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.570\nfrom this point forward where we\nonly have one and a half lines left,\n\n317\n00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.140\nnow we have to make it fit with that,\nhas to adjust for all of that extra space.\n\n318\n00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.959\nIt looks at everything before and\nsays, if we add a little bit here,\n\n319\n00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:24.441\ntake up a little bit here,\n[SOUND] it adjusts it a little bit.\n\n320\n00:14:24.441 --> 00:14:26.726\nThat's on by default,\nyou can actually turn that off so\n\n321\n00:14:26.726 --> 00:14:28.680\nit's only looking at\neach line individually.\n\n322\n00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.610\nI have never had a reason to do that\nthough, so it's called multi-line or\n\n323\n00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.010\nsingle line composing.\n\n324\n00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.400\nSo keep it on the multi-line,\nwhich is what's on by default.\n\n325\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.910\nBut then that way it's always\nlooking at the entire paragraph and\n\n326\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.920\nfiguring out how to compose\nit a little bit better.\n\n327\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.790\nSo that's no break, it says never break\nthat there, I don't want that to happen.\n\n328\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.380\nYou might put a no break on a URL.\n\n329\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.860\nThe URLs generally, break okay or\nactually will stay together.\n\n330\n00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.163\nBut sometimes they actually\nbreak because if they're long,\n\n331\n00:14:54.163 --> 00:14:57.128\nif you've got like an affiliate link from\nAmazon or something [LAUGH] like that,\n\n332\n00:14:57.128 --> 00:14:58.296\nthose things are really long.\n\n333\n00:14:58.296 --> 00:14:59.549\nAnd it just says,\nI gotta break it somewhere.\n\n334\n00:14:59.549 --> 00:15:02.210\nNow if you say no break,\nit doesn't fit on the line,\n\n335\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.097\nit's gonna break it anyway for you.\n\n336\n00:15:04.097 --> 00:15:05.350\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n337\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.110\nBut it's something you can\nadd on an individual basis.\n\n338\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.080\nAnd as we see when we start\nworking with text styles,\n\n339\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.100\nyou could also build that\ninto a style as well.\n\n340\n00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.710\nSo that you could set up a ton of\ntext that it says no break, so\n\n341\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.640\nevery time you apply that text style\nto it, that character style to it,\n\n342\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.160\nit also says don't break that text.\n\n343\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.450\nSo again, don't feel like you have to go\nover each word and make all these changes.\n\n344\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.332\nWe can build these into styles as we go.\n\n345\n00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:33.960\nAll right,\nI'm going to open up a new document and\n\n346\n00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.580\nreset my work space so\neverything's back to normal here.\n\n347\n00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.430\nAnd I'm gonna do what's\ncalled a Text Wrap.\n\n348\n00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.600\nSo this is where we have text flowing and\n\n349\n00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.130\nit flows around or over,\njumps over a picture, an image.\n\n350\n00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.719\nSo I'm just gonna put some text in here.\n\n351\n00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:52.734\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nbring in some text and\n\n352\n00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:54.350\nI'm gonna show you how to do that.\n\n353\n00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:58.120\nWe're gonna go over this in a future\nepisode, pretty soon I think?\n\n354\n00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.068\nYes, we're gonna go over that.\n\n355\n00:15:59.068 --> 00:16:00.396\nWe're gonna talk about importing the text.\n\n356\n00:16:00.396 --> 00:16:04.062\nSo I'm gonna do that really quickly, but\nI'll go into detail in a future episode.\n\n357\n00:16:04.062 --> 00:16:06.016\nSo I'm gonna come out to this text.\n\n358\n00:16:06.016 --> 00:16:07.952\nAnd I'm going to grab.\n\n359\n00:16:07.952 --> 00:16:11.510\nI don't have Alice in here, we need\nAlice 'cuz my picture is gonna be Alice.\n\n360\n00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.530\nSo, we gotta have that, right?\n\n361\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.790\nWe're gonna have our content match.\n\n362\n00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.150\nSo, let's come in here and I'm gonna get\nsome text and I'm just gonna bring it in.\n\n363\n00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.130\nSo, we're not gonna worry\ntoo much about that.\n\n364\n00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:24.887\nI am gonna take this text frame and I'm\ngonna create a multiple column text frame.\n\n365\n00:16:24.887 --> 00:16:29.455\nSo I'm gonna do command or control b,\nwhich brings up my Text Frame Options, or\n\n366\n00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:33.210\nI'm gonna go up under Object and\nchoose Text Frame Options.\n\n367\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.610\nI know that's weird it's\nunder the object menu, but\n\n368\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.090\nit's because I'm working with the Object,\nthe frame itself, not the text inside it.\n\n369\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:45.610\nThat brings up the Options, and\nI'm gonna tell it I want 2 columns.\n\n370\n00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.490\nSo right here, I've got number of\ncolumns to and I wanna tell it what my\n\n371\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:54.340\ngutter is in between there, and I'm\ngonna make it, let's just make it 0.375.\n\n372\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.770\nSo I'll just turn on preview and\nsee what that looks like.\n\n373\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.390\nThat looks pretty good, and\n\n374\n00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:04.580\nI'm going to select all of the text\nthat's here,aAnd I'm going to justify it.\n\n375\n00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:08.940\nSo that's in the paragraph panel, and\nI'm gonna choose the justified text.\n\n376\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.360\nSo, do that, just so\nI have some nice justified text.\n\n377\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.650\nNow, I can do that if I don't\nwant the [INAUDIBLE] go ahead and\n\n378\n00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.050\ndo a fill place holder text.\n\n379\n00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.810\nI'm gonna make this a little bit bigger.\n\n380\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.810\nI just selected all the text,\nagain command or\n\n381\n00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.580\nCTRL A selects everything in the frame.\n\n382\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.660\nI just wanted to fill out I\ndon't care that it runs over,\n\n383\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.670\nI just want to have a full\nthing of text there.\n\n384\n00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.490\nAnd I wanna pull out a picture\nin the middle of that and\n\n385\n00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.570\nI want the text to flow around it.\n\n386\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.720\nSo, I'm gonna do command or\ncontrol D to place an image.\n\n387\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.360\nI'm gonna bring in a picture of Alice\nin here, let's bring in this one and\n\n388\n00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.410\nI'm just going to click and\ndrag Just until it's about, that size.\n\n389\n00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.420\nAnd what I want though, is I want that\ntext, obviously, to flow around it.\n\n390\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:51.270\nAnd of course my text ran out of the frame\nbecause now, that picture is i the way.\n\n391\n00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.070\nSo I'm going to come in here and\nput this item here.\n\n392\n00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.700\nAnd I'm gonna open up the Text Wrap panel.\n\n393\n00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.540\nSo I'm gonna open a window and\nText Wrap has its own panel,\n\n394\n00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.050\nyou would think you would go in the type\nin tables but it does not Text Wrap.\n\n395\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.880\nSo I'm gonna bring that in and\nI have a couple different options for\n\n396\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.200\nhow that text needs to wrap.\n\n397\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.670\nAll right, so right now it says no wrap,\nI can come in here and\n\n398\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.670\nit will just jump over the entire\nA picture, so let's do that.\n\n399\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.360\nI can also have it wrap around\nthe clipping path, or the object itself.\n\n400\n00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.040\nIf I had a clipping path, or if this had\ntransparency on it, I can choose that.\n\n401\n00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.660\nIn fact, if we use, there's the flower\nthat I did in a previous episode where I\n\n402\n00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.900\ndid a clipping path.\n\n403\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.520\nYou can put that in there and\nwrap it around the object.\n\n404\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.050\nInfact I'll bring it in in a second,\nwe'll look at it that way as well, or\n\n405\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.840\nI can tell it jump over it, nothing on\nthe sides or I can tell it jump and\n\n406\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.360\nit jumps to the next frame.\n\n407\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.210\nNow it doesn't actually\nhave a thread anywhere,\n\n408\n00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.290\nit doesn't go anywhere else because\nwe didn't link it yet, but if we did,\n\n409\n00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.980\nthe text would pick up in the next frame.\n\n410\n00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.860\nSo lets leave it at this one here.\n\n411\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.730\nI can also tell how far off that\nneeds to be, kind of the offset.\n\n412\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.830\nSo as I click these and\nthis little Symbol is on.\n\n413\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.590\nThat says that you want to keep\nall measurements the same,\n\n414\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.330\npull this up a little bit.\n\n415\n00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:06.210\nAnd when I click on one they are all gonna\nmove so everything's gonna move together.\n\n416\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.820\nAll right so you can kind of see that\nit's pushing the text out a little bit,\n\n417\n00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.670\nit gives it a little\nbit of breathing room.\n\n418\n00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.620\nI can deselect this and just change\none size one side or the other.\n\n419\n00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.890\nBecause one thing you'll\nfind with the text is that,\n\n420\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.310\nof course, depending on your letting\nvalue and depending on all the paragraph\n\n421\n00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.130\nsettings that you have, it may or\nmay not wrap very well around this image.\n\n422\n00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.870\nIt looks pretty good here,\nbut sometimes as you move it,\n\n423\n00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.400\nyou might notice that\nthe text wrap is not perfect.\n\n424\n00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.970\nAnd I'll have to say that Just overall,\n\n425\n00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.080\nthe text wrap is not\nperfect in End Design.\n\n426\n00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.030\nThere's actually a script that I use for\nit,\n\n427\n00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.590\nif you're not into scripting,\ncheck that out.\n\n428\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.980\nThat's a way to add\nfunctionality to End Design.\n\n429\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.220\nThere's a script I use\ncalled Wrap Nudger and\n\n430\n00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.680\nit basically fixes everything that\nEnd Design doesn't do with the text wrap.\n\n431\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.320\nSo just keep that in mind if\nyou do a lot of text wrap,\n\n432\n00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.200\nit's not going to be perfect for you and\nit might be a little frustrating.\n\n433\n00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.400\nBut for me I just move the picture around\nuntil I get it just where the text and\n\n434\n00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.840\nthe picture are just playing\nnicely with each other.\n\n435\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.880\nLet's go ahead and do that,\nand I'll go ahead and do that.\n\n436\n00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.910\nNow, I can see that that\ntext wraps around that, and\n\n437\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.440\nof course as I move this picture.\n\n438\n00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.480\nIt doesn't draw as quickly as it should.\n\n439\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.850\nThat's something that has come up in\nthe last couple of versions of InDesign.\n\n440\n00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.080\nExcept the redraw, I'd like to\nsee it actually flow around, but\n\n441\n00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.180\nit's just a little jumpy for me.\n\n442\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.090\nBut I can look at that and be okay,\nthat look's pretty good and depending\n\n443\n00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.490\non your text settings, like I said,\nit may or may not wrap around really well.\n\n444\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.420\nBut here's something to keep in mind,\nthat text wrap is going to wrap\n\n445\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.770\naround that image for any text frame that\nhits that image is gonna wrap around it.\n\n446\n00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.560\nSo maybe I want this text frame over here.\n\n447\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.000\nI'm gonna draw this off to the side,\nand I'm just gonna type drink me,\n\n448\n00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.190\nand I'm going to make this\na little bit smaller,\n\n449\n00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.910\nand then I'm going to bring\nthis text frame over here, and\n\n450\n00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.380\nI say, I want it right there so\nit says drink me, and now it goes away.\n\n451\n00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.080\nWhat happened to it, iell, the text\nwrap that's on that image is saying,\n\n452\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.690\nwrap it around.\n\n453\n00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.930\nSo it's wrapping it, but because the frame\nis all right on top of that picture,\n\n454\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.940\nit wrapped it to infinity, it's just gone.\n\n455\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.890\nSo I have to do something\nwith that particular frame.\n\n456\n00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.270\nSo I'm gonna go into the frame options for\nthat frame, the drink me frame, Command or\n\n457\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.480\nControl, b and bring that up.\n\n458\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.460\nAnd I'm gonna tell it, ignore text wrap.\n\n459\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.340\nAnd when I do that Now it shows up.\n\n460\n00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.300\nSo it doesn't matter what order it's in.\n\n461\n00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.080\nIf you're coming from some of the other\nolder software like Pagemaker or\n\n462\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.010\nQuork, the stacking order mattered,\nInDesign doesn't care.\n\n463\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:22.600\nIf the text frame hits it and there's\ntext wrap on that image or that other,\n\n464\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.380\nyou can do a text drop\non another text frame.\n\n465\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.150\nBut if it hits a frame that has text wrap,\nit automatically says nope, gotta wrap,\n\n466\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.170\nand it disappears.\n\n467\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.270\nSo you need to tell it\nto ignore text wrap.\n\n468\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.500\nSo that's how we would get\naround that little bit there.\n\n469\n00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.700\nAll right let's put text on a path.\n\n470\n00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.410\nSo, under the text frame I have something\ncalled type on a path tool, and\n\n471\n00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.290\nthat means I can put type.\n\n472\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.120\nIt doesn't have to be\nin a rectangular frame.\n\n473\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.080\nI can put it on anything.\n\n474\n00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.740\nI can put it along a squiggle,\nI can put it around the shape of a circle.\n\n475\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.440\nSo let's do that.\n\n476\n00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.060\nI'm going to actually just create I\nthink I'll just take my pencil tool.\n\n477\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.560\nWe didn't really talk about a lot of\nthe drawing tools that are in there.\n\n478\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.310\nThe pencil tool is pretty rudimentary.\n\n479\n00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:04.720\nIf you're going to be drawing stuff,\nillustrator is really your option for\n\n480\n00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.000\nthat, but\nmaybe I just want a quick something, and\n\n481\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.670\nI didn't want to use\nthe pen tool to do it.\n\n482\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.550\nI can just take the pencil tool and\nI'll just put the squiggle in there.\n\n483\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.870\nIt's not a pretty squiggle.\n\n484\n00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.530\nIt's just there.\nI'm actually gonna make sure that there's\n\n485\n00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.890\na stroke assigned to it so I can see it,\nand we can remove that stroke later.\n\n486\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.190\nIt's just so that this way I\ncan actually see where it is.\n\n487\n00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.930\nI'm gonna go up to the type tool and\nclick and hold and\n\n488\n00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:26.170\nI get that type on a path tool.\n\n489\n00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.710\nSo when I do that, now I get this,\nit's the little I beam for\n\n490\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.260\nthe text but it has this little squiggle.\n\n491\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.440\nLook, it's almost exactly\nthe squiggle that I drew.\n\n492\n00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.400\nLook at that.\n\n493\n00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.290\nSo I'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna\nroll over it when I do I get a plus and\n\n494\n00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.840\nit says, you want to add text\nto this shape that's there.\n\n495\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.580\nSo you notice I didn't\neven have the item select,\n\n496\n00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.440\nI can just roll over it and then click.\n\n497\n00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.060\nAnd when I do that,\nthere's my flashing cursor.\n\n498\n00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.950\nAnd I'm gonna zoom back out.\n\n499\n00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.400\nI can do a little placeholder text,\nI have a shortcut set up for that, F2,\n\n500\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.570\nI wanna click on that,\nthen the text follows along there.\n\n501\n00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.140\nAnd that's just a text frame.\n\n502\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:01.200\nI can tell it's a text frame because we\nknow that a text frame has an in port and\n\n503\n00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.850\nan out port, right.\n\n504\n00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:03.950\nSo we see where the text comes in and\ncomes out.\n\n505\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.230\nThere's the in port right there.\n\n506\n00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.920\nAnd there's the out port right there.\n\n507\n00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.810\nSo it looks a little different when it's\non a squiggle, but it is still there and\n\n508\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.040\nwe can see it's a text.\n\n509\n00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.910\nSo I can make any changes I need to this.\n\n510\n00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.900\nDouble clicking on it gets me in my text\nframe, command control A selects it all.\n\n511\n00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.470\nI can make any changes I need to it,\nas I shrink it down.\n\n512\n00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.480\nOf course there is no text there because\nwhen you do full placeholder text,\n\n513\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.020\nit fills to the end of the frame.\n\n514\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.850\nBut I can run that again and\nit will fill it out the rest of the way.\n\n515\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.560\nNow that's still an editable frame.\n\n516\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.580\nWhen I select on that, I can get rid of\nthat stroke so I actually don't see it.\n\n517\n00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:39.110\nI can also use my direct selection\ntool and I can click on this item and\n\n518\n00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.865\nI can play with the stroke and\ndo whatever I need to it,\n\n519\n00:23:41.865 --> 00:23:44.785\neven though there's text on it,\nI can continually work with that.\n\n520\n00:23:44.785 --> 00:23:51.025\nSame thing I can do that with a circle,\na square, whatever I need to do that with.\n\n521\n00:23:51.025 --> 00:23:55.399\nI come in here, and just create a circle,\ndo the same click and\n\n522\n00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:58.573\nfill with placeholder text,\nand it puts it around.\n\n523\n00:23:58.573 --> 00:24:00.662\nNow, if you wanted to\ngo inside the circle,\n\n524\n00:24:00.662 --> 00:24:03.719\nthat's something you're gonna\nhave to do out in Illustrator.\n\n525\n00:24:03.719 --> 00:24:05.611\nSo unfortunately,\nit just lets you go around it.\n\n526\n00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:08.828\nI can play with the baseline shift and\nmove it more into the circle There's a lot\n\n527\n00:24:08.828 --> 00:24:10.890\nof different things you can\ndo with type on a path.\n\n528\n00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:14.347\nBut just know that you're not limited\nto just rectangles for your type.\n\n529\n00:24:14.347 --> 00:24:15.800\nSo you can put on whatever shape you want.\n\n530\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:18.440\nAll right.\n\n531\n00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.970\nLet's talk about using the eye\ndropper tool for text.\n\n532\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.770\nSo I am gonna just put some text in here.\n\n533\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.630\nFill it with placeholder text.\n\n534\n00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.880\nAnd I am gonna make this bold and\n\n535\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.670\nmaybe italic and\nmaybe even lets make it a color as well.\n\n536\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.230\nGet really wild and do that.\n\n537\n00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.800\nAnd go ahead and tell I want\nthe Text Fill to be this green.\n\n538\n00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.335\nAll right, so I'm gonna do that,\nthen I'm gonna create another text frame,\n\n539\n00:24:43.335 --> 00:24:45.010\nalso filled with placeholder text.\n\n540\n00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.510\nAnd I wanna pick up the attributes\nof this text and apply it here.\n\n541\n00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.940\nNow, as we'll see in a future movie,\nthis is great place for styles.\n\n542\n00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.550\nSo, I can say,\n\n543\n00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:57.980\nwhenever I want text to look like this\nI'm gonna create a style and apply it.\n\n544\n00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.390\nBut sometimes you just need to do it\nonce or twice and making the style will\n\n545\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.520\nactually take longer than just\ncopying the attributes and pasting it.\n\n546\n00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.530\nWhere style comes in handy is you\ncontinually update the style and\n\n547\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.780\nall the text updates.\n\n548\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.605\nThis you can't.\n\n549\n00:25:09.605 --> 00:25:11.950\nBut I'm gonna do it once and\nI'm not gonna worry about it again.\n\n550\n00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.310\nBut I want this second paragraph\nto look like the first one.\n\n551\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.540\nSo what I can do is I can use\nmy eye dropper tool for that.\n\n552\n00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.280\nAnd so I'm come over here and I can just,\nI have two different options.\n\n553\n00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.040\nI can either select the text\nfirst that I want to affect and\n\n554\n00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.630\nthen click on text with the eye\ndropper tool, and have it change.\n\n555\n00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:36.320\nOr I can pick up the attributes and\nthen apply it to text along the way.\n\n556\n00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.250\nSo this case I'm gonna select\nthe text that I want to effect,\n\n557\n00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.450\nchoose the eye dropper tool, and I'm gonna\nclick and make sure I click on the image.\n\n558\n00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.130\nOr I mean on the text itself.\n\n559\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:48.328\nAnd now the text that I selected now\nhas that attribute applied to it.\n\n560\n00:25:48.328 --> 00:25:50.282\nAnd if I double click on\nthe eye dropper tool,\n\n561\n00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:52.460\nthis is where I choose what gets changed.\n\n562\n00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.430\nSo there is everything\nthat's selected by default.\n\n563\n00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.940\nI can say I just want\nthe fill color to change.\n\n564\n00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.660\nSo I can be really picky on that.\n\n565\n00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.050\nBut, right now, it has everything set.\n\n566\n00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.990\nThe other thing that I can do, though,\nlike I said, is that I can pick up\n\n567\n00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.530\nsomething and I can say let's pick up\nthis text, so I just picked it up.\n\n568\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.250\nNow, I can come down here and\n\n569\n00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.245\nmy icon changes to a text with\nthe eyedropper tool, and now I can say,\n\n570\n00:26:12.245 --> 00:26:17.050\ndouble-click on this word, Traveller,\nand this word here, and this word here.\n\n571\n00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.050\nSo, I can just double-click on it and\nit's applying what's in that eye-dropper.\n\n572\n00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.540\nI can see that the eyedropper's full with\nall those attributes that are on there.\n\n573\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.450\nSo there's two different ways to do that,\nand again, whoops.\n\n574\n00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.260\nLet's zoom back out of there, there we go.\n\n575\n00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.730\nAnd it's just a quick way to pick up all\nthe attributes, but I haven't saved it.\n\n576\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:37.360\nSo if I decide to change this text to red,\nall this will stay green and\n\n577\n00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.750\nit won't update, and\nthat's where a style comes in handy.\n\n578\n00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.253\nBut it's a quick way to do it.\n\n579\n00:26:42.253 --> 00:26:45.870\nAll right, let's talk about\nchanging the case a little bit.\n\n580\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.340\nSo some of the other things in text is I\ncan change the case that something's in.\n\n581\n00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:56.264\nMaybe I want this to all be in lowercase,\nor I'm sorry in uppercase or small caps.\n\n582\n00:26:56.264 --> 00:26:57.800\nSo I'm coming over to the character panel.\n\n583\n00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.700\nAnd I can choose the case.\n\n584\n00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.430\nSo I come in here, and I tell it that I\nwant it to be in all caps, or small caps,\n\n585\n00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.920\nor superscript, or subscript.\n\n586\n00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:12.100\nWe talked about doing chemical formulas,\nwe would always tell the superscript H2O.\n\n587\n00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.796\nWe're going to select the two and\nmake that a subscript.\n\n588\n00:27:14.796 --> 00:27:17.200\nSo I come here and\nsay all caps or small caps.\n\n589\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.330\nLet's just choose that.\n\n590\n00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.500\nIt changes the case for us.\n\n591\n00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.340\nWe didn't have to do a caplocks on\nwhich is a good thing because if you\n\n592\n00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.850\nhave those cap locks on then\nyou're stuck with those caps.\n\n593\n00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:28.157\nWhere as this way I can turn it on and\noff, and again all this stuff,\n\n594\n00:27:28.157 --> 00:27:31.543\nI can build this into a style, so\nI don't have to do this every time.\n\n595\n00:27:31.543 --> 00:27:35.913\nI've already got it all set there, I've\ngot it so that it's bold, it's italic,\n\n596\n00:27:35.913 --> 00:27:39.845\nit's green, and it's in caps, and\nthen I can just say apply that style and\n\n597\n00:27:39.845 --> 00:27:42.924\nthen all that text changes,\nso it's super, super easy.\n\n598\n00:27:42.924 --> 00:27:44.910\nWe're gonna do paragraph rules,\nthis is fun.\n\n599\n00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.900\nLet's actually create a new page for this.\n\n600\n00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.520\nIf you want your paragraph to\nkinda be set off either by bars,\n\n601\n00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.100\nlines, or whatever I can set that\ninto what's called a paragraph rule.\n\n602\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.000\nThis is not a rule like something that\nmust be done It is an actual rule or\n\n603\n00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.540\nline that we are creating.\n\n604\n00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.470\nSo I'm gonna fill up the placeholder text.\n\n605\n00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.440\nAnd I'm gonna call this,\nI'm just gonna say, The Time Machine.\n\n606\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.294\nAnd I want that to be my header.\n\n607\n00:28:11.294 --> 00:28:15.538\nAnd I'm probably gonna do something like\ngive a little bit of space afterwards.\n\n608\n00:28:15.538 --> 00:28:17.250\nPush a little bit of\nspace afterwards there.\n\n609\n00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:21.160\nSo again, I have that breathing room,\nbut I don't have any hard returns.\n\n610\n00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.028\nAnd I'm gonna take this text, and\nI'm probably gonna make it bold, and\n\n611\n00:28:24.028 --> 00:28:27.147\nwe'll make it a little bit bigger anyway,\nso it looks a little bit different.\n\n612\n00:28:27.147 --> 00:28:28.410\nBut I also want to do something else.\n\n613\n00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.000\nI want to put either an underline\nunder it, or a double set of bars.\n\n614\n00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.800\nOr maybe I want a colored box\nback behind this text as well.\n\n615\n00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.660\nAnd I can do that with paragraph rules.\n\n616\n00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.390\nSo under the Paragraph Panel,\nunder the Paragraph Panel Menu,\n\n617\n00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.120\ncalled Paragraph Rules.\n\n618\n00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.770\nAnd turn on the previews\nwe can see it happening,\n\n619\n00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.850\nI can choose if I want to rule above or\nbelow.\n\n620\n00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.670\nI might want both and that's okay.\n\n621\n00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.868\nSo I can say let's do a rule above.\n\n622\n00:28:51.868 --> 00:28:53.610\nAnd I turn that on.\n\n623\n00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.050\nAnd it's above but why is it so low.\n\n624\n00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:56.810\nIt should not be above.\n\n625\n00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.360\nThat's very strange,\nthe rule above is not above at all, is it?\n\n626\n00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.400\nLet's do a rule of below and see what\nwe can get with that, the rule above,\n\n627\n00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.800\nactually set it down below,\nshould have been up above.\n\n628\n00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.160\nI thought may be there was an offset.\n\n629\n00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.040\nYou can tell either by\nhow much to offset that.\n\n630\n00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.145\nSo I can have this, have a little bit\nmore breathing room, if I want to.\n\n631\n00:29:15.145 --> 00:29:16.930\nYou want something like that.\n\n632\n00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:21.080\nI can play with color, text color is nice\nbecause as I change the text color of that\n\n633\n00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.630\nheadline, the line will change as well.\n\n634\n00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.880\nBut I can also just say no,\nlet's make it cinnamon,\n\n635\n00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.350\nlet's make it a little bit bolder.\n\n636\n00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.900\nI can tell it whether it's the width of\nthe column, which is sitting right now,\n\n637\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.710\nor the width of the text itself so\nthe line will grow with the text.\n\n638\n00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.790\nNow if you like the text but you also want\nit to maybe stick out a little bit on\n\n639\n00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.590\nthe right, I can do that as well.\n\n640\n00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:43.290\nCome here and give it a negative value,\nwhich I know sounds weird, but\n\n641\n00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.330\nit's negative because\nit's moving out of that.\n\n642\n00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.880\nSo I can say it always\nsticks out a little bit.\n\n643\n00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.040\nI can do it on the left side too, but\n\n644\n00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.000\nit might look a little weird here\nbecause it hangs outside the text frame.\n\n645\n00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.800\nBut I can do that, and I can also,\nin this case using the rule above or\n\n646\n00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.920\nbelow, whichever one you want I can\nmake a colored bar back behind it.\n\n647\n00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.767\nSo, let's do that.\n\n648\n00:30:00.767 --> 00:30:06.095\nI'm going to go ahead and tell it it's,\nlet's make it 80% of the cinnamon.\n\n649\n00:30:06.095 --> 00:30:07.659\nAnd I closed it, didn't want to do that.\n\n650\n00:30:07.659 --> 00:30:10.620\nI wanted to hit tab and\nI went ahead and closed that.\n\n651\n00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.740\nSo when I do that I can also, like I said,\nI can change the type of line.\n\n652\n00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.760\nMaybe I want a wavy line\ninstead of a sold line.\n\n653\n00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.030\nBut we're gonna go back to the solid line\nright now and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n654\n00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.710\nmake this just a really really thick one.\n\n655\n00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:27.610\nLet's make this actually like 30 and then,\nreturn again just out of habit there.\n\n656\n00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:28.630\nLet's come back to this.\n\n657\n00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.160\nAnd I want to offset it.\n\n658\n00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.410\nI'm gonna move it up a bit, so\nlet's just move it way up like this and\n\n659\n00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:40.250\nnow I've got my bar, my color bar back\nbehind it But that will change as I add\n\n660\n00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:45.530\nthis, I said if I call this the cool\ntime machine it keeps growing with that.\n\n661\n00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:46.680\nIf I hit return,\n\n662\n00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.410\nI actually hit a hard return,\nnow it continues that line that's there.\n\n663\n00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.480\nNow you notice I can't keep them\ntogether unless I make a really,\n\n664\n00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.640\nreally fat border that, or\na fat line that's there.\n\n665\n00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.570\nI can fake it.\n\n666\n00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.020\nBut, generally speaking,\nit's because it's each paragraph, so\n\n667\n00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.060\nwe don't want to break it.\n\n668\n00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.430\nIf I do break,\nit breaks it into two lines.\n\n669\n00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.090\nAnd if I hit Shift + Return,\n\n670\n00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.990\nwhich is a soft carriage return,\nwhich keeps it in the same paragraph.\n\n671\n00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.290\nWell, the underline is\nonly from the bottom.\n\n672\n00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.118\nNow if I always know\nit's gonna be two lines,\n\n673\n00:31:14.118 --> 00:31:17.257\nI can make another one that's thick\nenough to accommodate both those lines.\n\n674\n00:31:17.257 --> 00:31:18.921\nSo there's a little bit of\nwork arounds that you can do.\n\n675\n00:31:18.921 --> 00:31:23.233\nBut you can also do something fun,\nlike take this paragraph rule,\n\n676\n00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:26.934\nand instead of doing a solid line,\nI can do a dotted line.\n\n677\n00:31:26.934 --> 00:31:29.603\nWhich is kind of fun,\njust some dots back there, but\n\n678\n00:31:29.603 --> 00:31:33.900\nwhat you do is you can also is change the\ncolor of the gap in between those lines.\n\n679\n00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.276\nSo I could make this also cinnamon 80%.\n\n680\n00:31:38.276 --> 00:31:41.520\nAnd now I have a nice rounded\nbar that's back behind it.\n\n681\n00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.510\nSo that's actually kind of cool.\n\n682\n00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.490\nAnd then what works really well with\nthat is that this moves with the text,\n\n683\n00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:46.330\nobviously.\n\n684\n00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:50.850\nSo if I have some other text up above,\nI'm just gonna grab some.\n\n685\n00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.144\nAnd paste that and return that,\nwhoops, let's do that one.\n\n686\n00:31:54.144 --> 00:31:58.890\nAnd so now I have that so as this changes,\nit automatically moves with it.\n\n687\n00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:02.280\nI don't have to maintain\na separate element back behind it,\n\n688\n00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.760\nbehind that text and\nhave that move with him.\n\n689\n00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.405\nSo it's just some fun things to do,\nobviously though as an underline,\n\n690\n00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:08.915\nif you did an underline above and below.\n\n691\n00:32:08.915 --> 00:32:11.870\nIt's a nice way to set up your header\nto look a little different and\n\n692\n00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.773\nhave just a little bit of offset in there.\n\n693\n00:32:13.773 --> 00:32:17.791\nAnd again, build that into a style so\nyou don't have to do that.\n\n694\n00:32:17.791 --> 00:32:18.687\nEvery time.\n\n695\n00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:22.337\nWhether it's the bubble header, or\nif it's the line header, or whatever,\n\n696\n00:32:22.337 --> 00:32:23.813\nwe can build that into a style.\n\n697\n00:32:23.813 --> 00:32:26.651\nAnd the last thing I wanna show you with\nthe text right now, is something that is\n\n698\n00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:29.200\nnot very exciting, but there's two\nthings that I like that are in it.\n\n699\n00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.430\nAnd this is Tabs.\n\n700\n00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.090\nI mean, tab text is boring, right?\n\n701\n00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.720\nWell, we have to work with tabs.\n\n702\n00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.050\nAnd as we see when we get into a future\nepisode when we talk about tables,\n\n703\n00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.160\nwe're gonna see that tabs come in super,\nsuper handy with that.\n\n704\n00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.591\nSo all I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna type some text, and\n\n705\n00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:44.597\nI'm just gonna hit tab in-between each.\n\n706\n00:32:44.597 --> 00:32:47.164\nSo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, I'm gonna hit Return.\n\n707\n00:32:47.164 --> 00:32:50.610\nAnd do a, and b, and c, and d, and e.\n\n708\n00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:51.438\nSo I just hit tab in-between.\n\n709\n00:32:51.438 --> 00:32:53.430\nI can turn on my invisibles to see that.\n\n710\n00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:54.379\nThose are tabs.\n\n711\n00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.840\nTurn those back off.\n\n712\n00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.362\nSo if you're used to working with tabs,\nyou know that you can say, okay,\n\n713\n00:32:59.362 --> 00:33:00.635\nI don't like the way these tabs are.\n\n714\n00:33:00.635 --> 00:33:03.270\nI need to space out the tabs a little bit.\n\n715\n00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.440\nI'm gonna go up into the Type menu.\n\n716\n00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.587\nThis is one that does not\nlive in the Window menu.\n\n717\n00:33:06.587 --> 00:33:09.080\nIt's over here in the Type menu > Tabs.\n\n718\n00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.200\nAnd I can move this elsewhere if I want.\n\n719\n00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.820\nIt's nice because it locks into it, and\nI can see where the tabs are gonna be.\n\n720\n00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:18.223\nBut I also can see tabs over here\nif I click and hold on a tab.\n\n721\n00:33:18.223 --> 00:33:19.607\nI assume everybody knows how to work tabs.\n\n722\n00:33:19.607 --> 00:33:20.990\nI'm just gonna assume that you do.\n\n723\n00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.020\nHere's a left tab, and\nif I click and hold,\n\n724\n00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.920\nthough, I can see where\nthat tab is gonna sit.\n\n725\n00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.512\nSo I get a nice visual even\nif it's not connected to it.\n\n726\n00:33:27.512 --> 00:33:29.440\nAnd I can say, okay,\nI really like where that sits.\n\n727\n00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.100\nI like that spacing.\n\n728\n00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.240\nWell, how many of you've done this?\n\n729\n00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.836\nWhen you've done like, let's say,\nwe like it at three quarters of an inch.\n\n730\n00:33:34.836 --> 00:33:38.849\nAnd you say, okay, so I need the next\none at, [SOUND], one and a half inches.\n\n731\n00:33:38.849 --> 00:33:40.673\nThe next one at two and a quarter inches.\n\n732\n00:33:40.673 --> 00:33:41.397\nThe next one at three.\n\n733\n00:33:41.397 --> 00:33:44.677\nYou sit there, and you do the math,\nand you do the whole thing.\n\n734\n00:33:44.677 --> 00:33:47.650\nAnd then you still have more room and\nyou needed to space it out more.\n\n735\n00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.205\nThen you go,\nmaybe I make it seven-eighths, and\n\n736\n00:33:49.205 --> 00:33:50.320\nthen I gotta do all that math again.\n\n737\n00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.130\nI'm not in to math.\n\n738\n00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.249\nHere's what InDesign does for you.\n\n739\n00:33:53.249 --> 00:33:54.400\nI like this spacing.\n\n740\n00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.090\nLet's make it something really weird.\n\n741\n00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.380\nBeautiful, I love the space between 1 and\n2.\n\n742\n00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.930\nMake everything else the same.\n\n743\n00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.110\nCome over to the Tabs panel menu, and\n\n744\n00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.840\nsay, Repeat Tab, and\nit repeats it at that same amount.\n\n745\n00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.840\nYou don't like that amount?\n\n746\n00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.540\nLet's shorten that up.\nIt took up too much space.\n\n747\n00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.600\nShorten that up, Repeat Tab, and\nit shortens it all back up again.\n\n748\n00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.030\nSo that, to me, is really super cool.\n\n749\n00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:18.210\nThe other thing is that you can position\nthe panel against the text frame by\n\n750\n00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.247\nhitting that little magnet.\n\n751\n00:34:19.247 --> 00:34:20.973\nThat's a real quick way to do that.\n\n752\n00:34:20.973 --> 00:34:25.969\nAnd also, obviously,\nyou can set up alignments.\n\n753\n00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:30.737\nIf you've got an align on a decimal point,\nwell there's no actual decimal point, but\n\n754\n00:34:30.737 --> 00:34:34.284\nI can come over here and, instead,\nsay align on any character.\n\n755\n00:34:34.284 --> 00:34:36.760\nSo it doesn't have to be just\nalign on a decimal point.\n\n756\n00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.200\nMaybe I know that there's always\nan X in my product number or\n\n757\n00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.420\nsomething like that, and\nI want to align on that.\n\n758\n00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.798\nSo I can align on any character and,\nof course, if I do that,\n\n759\n00:34:43.798 --> 00:34:46.290\nthere isn't an X here and\nit doesn't know what to do with that.\n\n760\n00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.658\nBut there are a couple of\nreally cool things in Tabs.\n\n761\n00:34:48.658 --> 00:34:53.941\nAnd like I said, when we look at tables\nwe will see that we go from tabs, and\n\n762\n00:34:53.941 --> 00:34:59.500\nI can change this tabbed text into\ncolumns and tables as well, super easily.\n\n763\n00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.665\nSo sometimes you set up tabs\na little bit ahead of time and\n\n764\n00:35:01.665 --> 00:35:03.752\nthen you're gonna make\na table out of it afterwards.\n\n765\n00:35:03.752 --> 00:35:06.063\nSo knowing a little bit\nabout tabs is good.\n\n766\n00:35:06.063 --> 00:35:07.776\nIt's not very exciting, but there it is.\n\n767\n00:35:07.776 --> 00:35:09.860\nIt's something we need to know.\n\n768\n00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.590\n>> All right, Erica.\n\n769\n00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.300\nThank you for\nall that information on text.\n\n770\n00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.230\nDoes look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode.\n\n771\n00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.880\nBut before we sign out, do you have any\nadditional words you'd like to throw in?\n\n772\n00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.760\n>> No, I think we're good.\n\n773\n00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.440\n>> All right, very good.\n\n774\n00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.190\nI look forward to seeing you\nin the next episode, and\n\n775\n00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.680\nwe look forward to seeing you the viewers.\n\n776\n00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.111\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n777\n00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:24.951\n>> And

00:00:16.220\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.420\nin today's episode we're coming back at\nyou with more Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.100\nThat's right,\nanother episode inside of InDesign.\n\n6\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.250\nJoining me back in the studios\ntoday is Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.090\nErica, how are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.050\n>> I'm doing great, thanks.\n\n9\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.750\n>> Great.\nAnd really enjoying the journey that we've\n\n10\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.920\nbeen on with InDesign, and\nwhere are we gonna go next?\n\n11\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.080\n>> More type.\n\n12\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.890\n>> All right.\nVery good.\n\n13\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.625\n>> We'll look into diving\ninto some more type.\n\n14\n00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:37.220\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n15\n00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.810\nSo the first thing we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna start talking about OpenType.\n\n16\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.660\nSo OpenType is a type of font format.\n\n17\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.780\nSo you might have heard\nsomething called PostScript or\n\n18\n00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.860\nTrueType, there's also OpenType.\n\n19\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.590\nAnd OpenType just allows for\n\n20\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.634\nmore of those glyphs that we talked\nabout in the previous episode.\n\n21\n00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:57.280\nThe characters, how many characters\nwe can get into one font.\n\n22\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.910\nWhen I say a font I'm talking about\nthe actual physical, well I guess it's not\n\n23\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.640\nreally physical, it's digital, but\nthe actual package of the software that\n\n24\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.450\nis a font that makes up a font when\nwe load a font into our machine.\n\n25\n00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.985\nSo an OpenType font and that's what all\nyour type kit fonts will be if you have\n\n26\n00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:15.370\nthe Creative Cloud and you have access\nto Typekit, those are OpenType.\n\n27\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.340\nAnd I always tell people that if\nyou're buying fonts make sure that you\n\n28\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.790\nbuy OpenType if you can,\n\n29\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.840\nif it's an available option, because it\ndoes have a lot more available to you.\n\n30\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.630\nSo the old fonts, I don't remember\nhow many characters they had.\n\n31\n00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.240\nThey weren't many.\n\n32\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.980\nSome of the old ones didn't have a lot of\ncharacters that you could fit into a font.\n\n33\n00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.320\nOpenType can have up to\n65,000 glyphs in one font.\n\n34\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.350\nWhat does that mean to us?\n\n35\n00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.530\nIt means we have some cool stuff to\nlook at and some cool things that may or\n\n36\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.200\nmay not be built into a specific font, and\n\n37\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.550\nagain, it depends on what\nfont you're looking at.\n\n38\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.190\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and grab some text,\nand we'll just look at some text here,\n\n39\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.660\nand I wanna look at some of the different\nOpenType features that are available here.\n\n40\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.084\nSo, I'm just gonna actually\nput a couple returns in there,\n\n41\n00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:58.600\nwe're gonna put some things, we're gonna\nput some numbers in here, we're gonna make\n\n42\n00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.760\nthis into fractions, and we're also\ngonna look at things called ligatures.\n\n43\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.398\nSo again, this is something that's\nbuilt into the font, I just wanna kind\n\n44\n00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:08.890\nof show you where to access this, and\nyour font may or may not have that.\n\n45\n00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.480\nWhat we wanna look for though,\nis in fonts, when we're looking at those,\n\n46\n00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.800\nI'm gonna, take off that filter, is I'm\ngonna come over here to the fonts, and\n\n47\n00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.320\nI can see that some of them\nhave this O next to them.\n\n48\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.600\nAnd if it's in color,\ncuz the font menus used to be in color and\n\n49\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.490\nthey're not anymore, they're green and\nblack, is what you might see, so green and\n\n50\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.750\nblack O, and that's just O for OpenType.\n\n51\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.910\nAnd that means, that, like I said,\n\n52\n00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.440\nyou probably have a lot more\noptions to choose from.\n\n53\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.610\nThe other thing that you'll notice\nwhen you have an OpenType font is that\n\n54\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.640\nyou may have a lot of different faces,\ndifferent typefaces available to you.\n\n55\n00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.740\nSo when I've got this one, I'm not even\ngonna attempt to pronounce that font, but\n\n56\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.650\nI've got Light, Book,\nDemi, Medium and Bold.\n\n57\n00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.280\nSo that's what you're looking for\nwhen you choose a font,\n\n58\n00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.370\nespecially if you're going\nto be doing a lot of text.\n\n59\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.350\nYou're going to want one with a lot of\ndifferent faces to it, you want bold and\n\n60\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.780\nitalic and medium and\ncondensed and all that so\n\n61\n00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.870\nthat you're not putting\nin different fonts.\n\n62\n00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.150\nYou're not using Palentino and\nTimes and whatever else.\n\n63\n00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.400\nYou're not mixing all of those.\n\n64\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.180\nIt's all in the same family but\njust different fonts off of that.\n\n65\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.408\nSo just keep in mind that's OpenTpe and\n\n66\n00:03:08.408 --> 00:03:12.860\nthere's a special OpenType menu to\naccess special OpenType features.\n\n67\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.920\nSo I'm gonna go over to\nthe Character panel.\n\n68\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.650\nI'm gonna pull that off and\npull that up and\n\n69\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.820\nin that Character panel\nwhen I have text selected.\n\n70\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.700\nSo I'm just gonna select one\nword just to start with, and\n\n71\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.620\nI wanna make sure that I have\nassigned an OpenType font to that.\n\n72\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.060\nSo I'm gonna come down to something like,\nlet's do Minion Pro.\n\n73\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.320\nSo I'm gonna choose that.\n\n74\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.610\nLet's do Myriad instead.\n\n75\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.820\nI only have regular in there.\n\n76\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.220\nI want something with a lot of choices.\n\n77\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.880\nLook at Myriad.\n\n78\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.880\nWhen I choose Myriad Pro,\nlook at all those choices I have,\n\n79\n00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.300\neven when I choose Myriad Pro regular when\nI pull down this menu I can see that I\n\n80\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.120\nhave all those different fonts\navailable within that Myriad family and\n\n81\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.310\nthat's just good to know.\n\n82\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.400\nSo I put that in there,\nI just made that one word Myriad,\n\n83\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.800\nlet's make it a little bit bigger as well.\n\n84\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.398\nAnd then I'm going to go over to the\ncharacter panel menu and choose OpenType.\n\n85\n00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:01.450\nAnd from OpenType I get this huge\nmenu that pops up from there.\n\n86\n00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.340\nAnd we're not gonna worry about a lot\nof that, just look and see at the top\n\n87\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.810\nsection, there are certain things like\nFractions, Ordinals, which are the numbers\n\n88\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.610\nlike first, second, the st, and\nthe nd and all that, those are ordinals.\n\n89\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.790\nAnd some items are in brackets.\n\n90\n00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.500\nIf they're in brackets it means that they\nare not available in this particular font.\n\n91\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.290\nAnd what the fractions mean, it's not\nthat I can't type one, slash, two.\n\n92\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.117\nAnd as we saw in the glimpse panel,\n\n93\n00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:29.030\nthey might have some\nstandard fractions built in.\n\n94\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.198\nLike half, or a quarter and\nan eighth maybe.\n\n95\n00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:36.115\nBut what OpenType can do if\nthey have fractions available,\n\n96\n00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:40.125\nand they're not in the brackets,\nis it can take any number that it sees\n\n97\n00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:43.325\nas a fraction, and\nactually format it to be a fraction.\n\n98\n00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:46.205\nSo that's one of the great things\nabout OpenType is that you have\n\n99\n00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:49.305\naccess to this special\nhandling of characters.\n\n100\n00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:51.895\nSo other things I might have\nare things like ligatures.\n\n101\n00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:53.665\nNow, this one does not\nhave ligatures at all.\n\n102\n00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:56.720\nI'll show one in a minute that does\nhave ligatures, and also swashes.\n\n103\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.210\nSo we'll go with fractions for\nthis one and I'm going to turn it on, and\n\n104\n00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.880\nactually I need to select all\nthe text where I want that to be,\n\n105\n00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.570\nand then I'm going to go ahead and make\nthat Myriad or go Myriad Pro regular, and\n\n106\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.380\nI'm going to turn on Fractions\nfrom the Panel Menu.\n\n107\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.860\nUnder the OpenType select Fractions,\nand what that does for me,\n\n108\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.300\nis that when when I type a number,\nif I type 12 and\n\n109\n00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.780\nI type slash I go ahead and I get that\nfraction number that's there already.\n\n110\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.790\nSo then, I know that that number is, or\n\n111\n00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.500\nthat text can handle whatever\nfractions I end up with.\n\n112\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.580\nI shouldn't have done\nthat when I first did it.\n\n113\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.400\nLet's turn this off.\n\n114\n00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.429\nLet's turn fractions off.\n\n115\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.410\nAnd that's what it looks like\nwhen I first type it, right?\n\n116\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.950\n12 over 13, just any weird amount\nthat I can do and put it over that.\n\n117\n00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.890\nBut I can tell, oops,\nneeds to be numbers to be a fraction.\n\n118\n00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.950\nLet's select just that text, and then\nI'm coming here to OpenType Fractions.\n\n119\n00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.810\nAnd it goes ahead and\nit formats that as a fraction for me.\n\n120\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.670\nI didn't have to have this\nglyph that actually had that\n\n121\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.360\nspecific fraction in there.\n\n122\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.050\nIt just is those numbers.\n\n123\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.160\nIt sees it, sees the slash.\n\n124\n00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.430\nAs soon as I put the slash in there\nit knows, that must be a fraction.\n\n125\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.310\nI'm gonna change it to a different\nfont that I know we have some.\n\n126\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.770\nSome swashes in here, so\nit's called Caflisch Script Pro.\n\n127\n00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.900\nAnd I'm just gonna zoom in a little\nbit more on the text here.\n\n128\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.710\nAnd I'm gonna find a letter T or let's see\na letter A maybe, N might work as well.\n\n129\n00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.240\nI'm gonna have this all selected.\n\n130\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.120\nI'm gonna go up again to that OpenType\nmenus and I'm gonna come in here and\n\n131\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.390\nsay swash.\n\n132\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.460\nNow watch the upper case N in\nnevertheless over here and\n\n133\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.260\nit should change, hopefully that\nhas a different character to it.\n\n134\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.570\nSo now it's got swash.\n\n135\n00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.230\nYou can see it's a little bit more fancy,\nit's got those swirls on it.\n\n136\n00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.730\nAnd that's what swashes are.\n\n137\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.880\nSo it means that there's this\nalternate set of characters for\n\n138\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.890\nany of the letters that\nare in this font here.\n\n139\n00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.370\nThose are swashes.\n\n140\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.408\nSo again anything that you think, any\nspecial typography that you might need,\n\n141\n00:06:52.408 --> 00:06:54.840\nlook into OpenTpe.\n\n142\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.730\nAnd again typography is\na subject all to itself.\n\n143\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.230\nWe could go on and on about it and I'm\nprobably not the person to talk about that\n\n144\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.830\nbecause sometimes I don't know\nthe difference between fonts but\n\n145\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.950\nI have friends who do typer files and\nI'm an embarrassment to them I'm sure.\n\n146\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.860\nBut I do like that I can come in here and\nsay, I don't really like the sort of,\n\n147\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.810\nit looked more like handwriting or\njust printing, I guess.\n\n148\n00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.200\nIn this particular font.\n\n149\n00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.380\nWhen I turn on the swashes, it gives\nit that little bit of extra flair,\n\n150\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.950\ngives it more like\na handwriting feel to it.\n\n151\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.518\nSo, feel free to look in through\nall the OpenType fonts or\n\n152\n00:07:24.518 --> 00:07:27.740\nOpenType features, and again,\nif it's in brackets it means that,\n\n153\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.690\nthat is not built into\nthat particular font.\n\n154\n00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.280\nThey're very well crafted\nfonts generally speaking.\n\n155\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.000\nSo, that's kind of all I wanna\nsay about OpenType really.\n\n156\n00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.730\nJust so you know it's there, know that,\n\n157\n00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.460\nthat's the prefered format if\nyou have an option to do that.\n\n158\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.100\nI know that there's\na lot more to dig into,\n\n159\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.622\nand it's all in that character panel,\ninside the OpenType panel that's there.\n\n160\n00:07:46.622 --> 00:07:49.890\nAll right, I'm gonna bring in\na whole new plain document,\n\n161\n00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.620\nand we're gonna start bringing\nin text from different places.\n\n162\n00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.620\nSo we're gonna import it.\n\n163\n00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.769\nAnd then we're gonna do text flow.\n\n164\n00:07:56.769 --> 00:08:00.130\nI've showed in a couple of episodes\nabout linked text or overset text,\n\n165\n00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.382\nwhere we have text jumping\nfrom frame to frame.\n\n166\n00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:04.053\nEven jumping across pages.\n\n167\n00:08:04.053 --> 00:08:05.653\nAnd that's called threaded text.\n\n168\n00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:06.816\nSo we're gonna do that as well.\n\n169\n00:08:06.816 --> 00:08:08.472\nBut where does that text come from?\n\n170\n00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:09.768\nDo I have to type this all in?\n\n171\n00:08:09.768 --> 00:08:10.302\nNope.\n\n172\n00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:12.490\nDo I have to use placeholder\ntext all the time?\n\n173\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.150\nNope.\n\n174\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.960\nSo I could bring that in from elsewhere,\nwhether that's rich text file, or\n\n175\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.280\nit's a Word file, or\neven a plain text file.\n\n176\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.030\nAnywhere I can import a text file,\nInDesign can handle that text.\n\n177\n00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:29.240\nAnd unlike picture links when we bring in\na picture we saw in a previous episode,\n\n178\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.890\nwe bring in an image it creates\na link back to the original.\n\n179\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.630\nThat is not the standard case for text.\n\n180\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.370\nWhen I bring in text from somewhere\nelse it is now just text and\n\n181\n00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.750\nInDesign as if I typed it myself.\n\n182\n00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.930\nNow I do have the option of setting that\npreference and telling it that it is\n\n183\n00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.220\na link, that the text will be a link\ninstead of actual text when it comes in.\n\n184\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.950\nBut generally speaking I don't do\nthat because if I make changes and\n\n185\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.690\nformat the text in InDesign and\n\n186\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:01.190\nI bring it back in from Word or wherever\nit came from, I lose my formatting.\n\n187\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.670\nSo that's something I generally don't do,\nthere are plugins that handle that,\n\n188\n00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.080\nthe kind of two way back and\nforth, make changes in InDesign,\n\n189\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.350\nchanges in the Word file and vice versa.\n\n190\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.580\nSo if that's something you need to do,\na lot of back and\n\n191\n00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.490\nforth with text and edits not being ready\nwhen they actually come to InDesign which\n\n192\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.880\nis a problem we all\ndeal with as designers.\n\n193\n00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.390\nIf that's something you do all the time\na plugin might be something you need to\n\n194\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.780\nlook for with that.\n\n195\n00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.228\nThat being said let's bring in\nsome text that we have here.\n\n196\n00:09:27.228 --> 00:09:30.170\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and I've got a\ncouple of different ways to bring text in.\n\n197\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.800\nObviously I can create a text frame,\nwhich is something we've been doing.\n\n198\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.240\nWe've entered text, right, we just start\ntyping, this is my extent of my typing.\n\n199\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.960\nI'm just gonna come in here and start\ntyping I also can use placeholder text.\n\n200\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.130\nAnd the reason I use placeholder text\nis to set up the structure of my text.\n\n201\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.670\nHow many columns do I have,\nwhat's the lettering look like,\n\n202\n00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.190\nwhat's the styling look like?\n\n203\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.750\nBut then at some point the real\ntext is gonna come in so\n\n204\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.030\nI'm gonna have to take everything and\nkind of delete that text that's there.\n\n205\n00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.250\nSo I might select everything and delete\nit but I've already set up my frames and\n\n206\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.960\nwhatever I need to do with that.\n\n207\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.140\nSo what I might want to do is I might\nalready have the frame set up here,\n\n208\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.460\nmaybe I know I have this frame and\n\n209\n00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.030\nI've set it up with the text frame\noptions command or control B.\n\n210\n00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.211\nAnd I've told that it's two columns,\nand we've already set that up.\n\n211\n00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:17.500\nBut now, I'm going to bring in\nthe extra text that we actually have.\n\n212\n00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.260\nSo to do that,\nI'm gonna use the place command.\n\n213\n00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.410\nIt's the same command we've been using for\nimages, PDFs,\n\n214\n00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.025\neverything that comes in\ngets the place command.\n\n215\n00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:28.045\nSame thing and now, right now,\nmy cursor is in a text frame.\n\n216\n00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:30.480\nSo that text will flow\ninto that text frame.\n\n217\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.630\nSo I'm gonna do command or\ncontrol D to bring that up.\n\n218\n00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.948\nI can also say replace selected item.\n\n219\n00:10:34.948 --> 00:10:36.856\nI turn that option back\non because with text,\n\n220\n00:10:36.856 --> 00:10:38.570\nI'll probably want it to flow right in.\n\n221\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:43.420\nAnd I'm gonna just grab some text, and\nin this case, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n222\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.200\njust grab this RTF file.\n\n223\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.680\nThat's a rich text file.\n\n224\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.770\nYou notice I also have a .doc file,\n\n225\n00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:53.306\nyou might have a DOCX file which is\nthe newer format for Word files, and\n\n226\n00:10:53.306 --> 00:10:57.480\n.txt file which is just a plain text file\nso there's no formatting applied to it.\n\n227\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.200\nIn a minute we're gonna talk about the\nformatting as well and how we handle that.\n\n228\n00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.930\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and say okay,\nand I don't have show import options\n\n229\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.700\nturned on yet,\nwe probably wanna do that when we bring in\n\n230\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.380\ntext because that's how we control what\nhappens to the text when it comes in.\n\n231\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.990\nBut right now,\nI'm just gonna say go with it.\n\n232\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.324\nIt's gonna use whatever\noptions I used the last time.\n\n233\n00:11:14.324 --> 00:11:17.740\nBasically I just wanna show you,I bring\nit in and as soon as I do that, it flowed\n\n234\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.710\nright into that frame because I told\nit to replace that, the selected frame.\n\n235\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.670\nSo automatically put anything\ncoming in right into that frame.\n\n236\n00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.890\nSo now I have it and if I knew that it was\nthe right you know, style and everything,\n\n237\n00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:29.610\nit's all ready to go.\n\n238\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.460\nI pretty much have it ready to go, I can\nsee that I do have some over set text,\n\n239\n00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.830\nas well, we're gonna fix that in a minute.\n\n240\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.450\nI'm going to select this frame,\nand I'm going to delete it.\n\n241\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.680\nNow you notice I didn't hit my\nselection tool and click on it.\n\n242\n00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.960\nI was still at the type tool.\n\n243\n00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.800\nHere's a little trick, if you're\nworking with type, you're typing along,\n\n244\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.070\nworking along, working with type and\nyou realize you need to change the size of\n\n245\n00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.110\nthis frame or where it is,\nyou hold down the command key or\n\n246\n00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.780\nthe control key on a PC, it temporarily\nchanges it to the selection tool.\n\n247\n00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.570\nSo I can actually make changes, move it,\ndelete it, whatever I need to do.\n\n248\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.660\nBut when I let go I still have that type\ntool, so I don't have to switch back and\n\n249\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.340\nforth, so\nInDesign's pretty smart with that.\n\n250\n00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.820\nSo if I hold down the command or\ncontrol key and\n\n251\n00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.860\nclick once, now it's selected,\nthen I just hit delete.\n\n252\n00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.020\nSo I don't even have to switch to that,\nbecause I knew the next thing I wanted\n\n253\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.940\nwas so my type tool again, so I don't\nwant to have to keep switching tools.\n\n254\n00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.120\nSo let's bring in type without a frame.\n\n255\n00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.500\nSo I said that everything needs\nto live in a frame in InDesign.\n\n256\n00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.840\nAnd that's true.\n\n257\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.880\nBut if I don't have one set up,\nwhen I bring in text,\n\n258\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.120\nit will automatically create one for\nme, right?\n\n259\n00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.330\nSo I have a lot of options.\n\n260\n00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.890\nWhat do I do with that\nwhen I bring that in?\n\n261\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.040\nSo let me use my direct selection tool.\n\n262\n00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.920\nDoesn't really matter a whole lot, but\nI just like to know that I have nothing\n\n263\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.220\nselected, I don't have my cursor\nsitting in a text frame somewhere, and\n\n264\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.000\nI don't accidentally, I'm gonna take\na drink really quick,excuse me.\n\n265\n00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.130\nSometimes I get all choked\nup all over the subjects.\n\n266\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:53.920\nSo I wanna make sure that I don't have\nmy cursor sitting somewhere else and\n\n267\n00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.370\naccidentally flow text into something\non another page that I'm not aware of.\n\n268\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.230\nAll right, so I've got my direct\nselection tool, I'm gonna go up to\n\n269\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:05.010\nthe place command, again command or\ncontrol D or you can do file, place.\n\n270\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.040\nCome in here, file,\nplace and choose the text.\n\n271\n00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:13.940\nAnd in this case, I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose, let's go ahead with the RTF file.\n\n272\n00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.807\nI believe that's the long one,\nyeah, that's super long.\n\n273\n00:13:16.807 --> 00:13:19.310\nAnd I just want to make sure\nthat was one that has a lot.\n\n274\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.700\nI wanna show you how we're gonna flow and\nlink all of these text frames here.\n\n275\n00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.460\nSo I am gonna turn on show import options.\n\n276\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.380\nNow I'm gonna put my safety feature on,\nwhich is replace selected item.\n\n277\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.710\nI'm gonna deselect that,\n\n278\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.330\nbecause again, I'm the type that'll have\nsomething selected, and accidentally flow\n\n279\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.910\na text into some other frame that was\nsupposed to be doing something else.\n\n280\n00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.920\nSo show import options,\n\n281\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.310\nthis is where we get to choose what\nhappens to the text when it comes in.\n\n282\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.040\nSo let's say open, and\nI get this huge dialogue box.\n\n283\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.310\nAnd what I wanna do is,\nI wanna just tell it what does and\n\n284\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.400\ndoes not come in with this particular job.\n\n285\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.060\nAnd I'm only gonna show you\na couple of that are here.\n\n286\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.640\nWhen we get to styles in a future episode\n\n287\n00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.160\nI'm gonna show you\na little bit more of it.\n\n288\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.050\nBut right now we're gonna do like\nthe basic because what I wanna\n\n289\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.270\ndo is kind of strip everything out I\ndon't want a lot of stuff coming in\n\n290\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.720\neven though I know this person set it up,\n\n291\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.030\nbut they might have formatted it\nIn a way that isn't good for me.\n\n292\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.290\nSo I wanna kind of just bring it in basic,\n\n293\n00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.390\nI just want the text,\nI'm gonna format in InDesign.\n\n294\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.920\nBasically, I keep everything\nat the top selected.\n\n295\n00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.940\nAnd that's because most of this,\n\n296\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.498\nInDesign doesn't even really\nhandle very well anyway.\n\n297\n00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:27.390\nFootnotes and endnotes are not great in\nInDesign, anybody that works with those\n\n298\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.800\nwill tell you that, but if they're there,\nthey'll at least come in.\n\n299\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.220\nYou'll have to reformat them in InDesign,\nbut they're there for you to use.\n\n300\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.270\nThe other thing is use topographer's\nquotes, those are our curly quotes so\n\n301\n00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.580\nwe wanna make sure the curly\nquotes come in fine and\n\n302\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.480\nthen formatting here's\nwhat I generally do.\n\n303\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.770\nI'm gonna remove styles and\nformattings from text and tables.\n\n304\n00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.250\nSo, any text or\ntable that's inside this file, and\n\n305\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.990\nthis is just a rich text file,\nis going to be stripped out.\n\n306\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.750\nAnd I'm going to preserve local overrides.\n\n307\n00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.990\nWe'll talk about that when\nwe get to styles as well.\n\n308\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.260\nSo preserve local overrides,\nleave that on.\n\n309\n00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.790\nIf this is something that\nyou've made changes to,\n\n310\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.120\nyou can at any time, save that preset,\nand give it a name, and\n\n311\n00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.430\nthen next time you bring it in you don't\nhave to think about all these options.\n\n312\n00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.170\nWe talked in the very beginning of all\nthe different presets that are available.\n\n313\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.210\nWe can save that, if we know that this is\nBob's text that comes in and Bob always\n\n314\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.690\ndoes it a certain way, we've got it set\nup then we can call it Bob's text and\n\n315\n00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.480\nwe know that when that comes\nthat's exactly set up for Bob.\n\n316\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.369\nI'm not gonna save a preset because\nI didn't really do anything to it and\n\n317\n00:15:24.369 --> 00:15:25.271\nI'll say okay.\n\n318\n00:15:25.271 --> 00:15:29.967\nWhen I do that I get at this loaded text\ncursor, I'm going to zoom in a little bit\n\n319\n00:15:29.967 --> 00:15:35.030\nso you can see that it is a cursor full\nof text and it's ready to be placed.\n\n320\n00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.810\nSo I have a lot of different options,\nwhat to do with this text.\n\n321\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.530\nThe first thing I can do is I can just\nclick and where ever I click it will\n\n322\n00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.130\nautomatically fill to the right and\nto the bottom down to the margins.\n\n323\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.130\nSo from up in the upper left hand corner,\nI can fill my entire page with text.\n\n324\n00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.343\nI know it's a text frame because\nI can see the little import and\n\n325\n00:15:52.343 --> 00:15:54.268\nthe out port letter down there.\n\n326\n00:15:54.268 --> 00:15:55.919\nThe out port though has a plus in it and\n\n327\n00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:58.325\nthat means there's more\nstory than there was frame.\n\n328\n00:15:58.325 --> 00:16:01.257\nThere's more that needs to\nbe finished to that, so\n\n329\n00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:05.092\nit's sitting there kind of waiting for\nus to do something with it.\n\n330\n00:16:05.092 --> 00:16:08.645\nAll right, so I can also,\nI'm gonna undo that, we'll back up and\n\n331\n00:16:08.645 --> 00:16:11.386\nI'll get back to that loaded\nA place cursor again.\n\n332\n00:16:11.386 --> 00:16:13.855\nI can click and\ndrag to place that text, so\n\n333\n00:16:13.855 --> 00:16:17.470\nthat's another way I can just\ndrag it out to the size.\n\n334\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.800\nIf maybe I have guides out there or\nmaybe I just eyeballing it and\n\n335\n00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.280\nI think okay this looks good this is\nexactly where I want the text to be,\n\n336\n00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.130\ndrag it out and there we have it.\n\n337\n00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.980\nSo want to do that as well.\n\n338\n00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:33.550\nSo let's go ahead and thread these text\nframes because obviously I have some text\n\n339\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.460\nand it does not fit on these one page, and\nI want to continue it from page to page.\n\n340\n00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.710\nSo the first thing that I'm gonna do is\nI'm going to just go ahead and click, and\n\n341\n00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.520\nit fills it out to the size of the margins\nand it says hey, you've got more text,\n\n342\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.900\nwhat do you want to do with that?\n\n343\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.680\nWell what we need to do is we need\nto click inside that little x, so\n\n344\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.260\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit here.\n\n345\n00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.710\nI just click inside the x, and when I\ndo that, it picks up the text again.\n\n346\n00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:59.800\nSo it picked up the rest of the story and\nnow is ready to place the rest of that.\n\n347\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.750\nSo I'm gonna create a whole new page,\nI don't have any pages in here.\n\n348\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.260\nI'm gonna use my keyboard shortcut,\ncommand or control, shift, P.\n\n349\n00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.190\nAnd now I've got page ready to go.\n\n350\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.840\nNow I could click again and\nhave it fill out,\n\n351\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.210\nor maybe I know that I want to fill\nit out just in a smaller frame.\n\n352\n00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.420\nSo I might click and do that, and say,\nokay good, now I've got that column,\n\n353\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.450\nthat looks good.\n\n354\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.370\nMaybe I've got some pictures here and\nI'm trying to work around them, or I just\n\n355\n00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.830\nam trying to just this strange, layout,\njust, you know, a little fun layout.\n\n356\n00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:29.710\nI can click on that plus again and\npick it up.\n\n357\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.030\nSo I can keep clicking on that plus,\n\n358\n00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.140\npicking up what's remaining\nof the story and place that.\n\n359\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.350\nSo I'm gonna stop there for\n\n360\n00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.490\na second then I'll show you some\nother quicker ways to do that.\n\n361\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.040\nWhat I wanna show you is how\nthese are all threaded together.\n\n362\n00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.500\nIf I go up to the Window menu, sorry to\nthe View menu and I choose Extras and\n\n363\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.240\nI view Text Threads,\nlet's go down here, Show Text Threads.\n\n364\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.450\nI can see that it comes out,\nthe text comes out of this port here and\n\n365\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.440\nflows into the frame and on this page\nit flows to that frame and that frame.\n\n366\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.070\nAs I move this text around,\nthose threads go with me, so\n\n367\n00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:09.170\nI'm able to constantly see where that\ntext threads and how that works.\n\n368\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.250\nWe have that and I can visually see that.\n\n369\n00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.470\nThe nice thing is that I have that turned\non all the time, because when I don't have\n\n370\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:18.510\na frame selected, I don't see all those\nblue lines, that can be kind of confusing.\n\n371\n00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.470\nIt's really nice if you have got\npaginated pages and you're doing where\n\n372\n00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.430\nyou've got page one over here, and\ntwo here, and three here, and four here.\n\n373\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.960\nAnd does like this little shoelace thing,\nwhen we're talking about pagination and\n\n374\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.540\nthe pages, as I scroll through, I'm\nable to select one, and kind of follow.\n\n375\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.100\nCuz sometimes it jumps from page one to\npage five, so you have to scroll down and\n\n376\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.930\nfind where that arrow goes to and\nconnects to, so\n\n377\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.030\nthat's a little bit of how\nwe see the text threads.\n\n378\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.730\nI'm gonna jump to the second page where I\nleft off, I still have a lot of story left\n\n379\n00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.180\nto place and that clicking on\neach plus and placing it and\n\n380\n00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.250\nclicking and placing it is kind of\ntiresome, that can really slow you down.\n\n381\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.040\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to click on it to pick it up.\n\n382\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.330\nWe're gonna create that new page,\ncommand Ctrl+Shift+P and\n\n383\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.870\ninstead I'm going to hold down\nthe Option key, or the Alt key on a PC.\n\n384\n00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.430\nAnd when I do that, I'm actually gonna\nzoom in so I can see the cursor again.\n\n385\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.240\nWhen I hold down the Option\nkey it kind of changes,\n\n386\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.740\nit's a little hard to see probably, but\n\n387\n00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.460\ninstead of having lines that look like\ntext it changes to this serpentine, but\n\n388\n00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.870\nit's half dashed, the first half of it is\ndashed, and then there's a solid line.\n\n389\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.630\nBut like I said it's a little hard to see\nbut you can see that it's changing at\n\n390\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:33.040\nleast, and what that's doing is that's\ngetting set to semi auto flow and\n\n391\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.230\nthat means I'm going to hold that down and\ndrag out to whatever size I need and\n\n392\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.660\nit's gonna place it but it's also\ngonna pick up the rest of the story.\n\n393\n00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.440\nSo it basically saved me from having\nto click on that little red x,\n\n394\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.830\nor plus, every time.\n\n395\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.380\nSo if I just keep holding down the Option\nor Alt key I can continue drawing out\n\n396\n00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.140\nthese frames, and we'll go to the next\npage, create a new page and drag that out\n\n397\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.110\nand it continues to place that story and\nthere's still more of that story.\n\n398\n00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.800\nHave the whole entire story here so\nthere's a lot to place.\n\n399\n00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.270\nSo I can do that; that's\ncalled semi-auto-flow, and\n\n400\n00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.150\nthat's just a quick way\nto thread text together.\n\n401\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.900\nNow I don't have to have text in it for\nthis to work.\n\n402\n00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.840\nThis actually will work even with plain\ntext threads, I'll show you that as well.\n\n403\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.300\nI'm gonna delete that last one,\nI just want to make sure I have enough\n\n404\n00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.150\nstory left to do the next\nthing I want to do.\n\n405\n00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.150\nAnd, if I don't have\nthis already laid out, or\n\n406\n00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:29.230\ndon't have the text ready, and\nI just wanna lay out my frames,\n\n407\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.970\nI can connect them all without\ntext actually being there.\n\n408\n00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.970\nSo, I don't have to wait\ntil the text is ready.\n\n409\n00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.050\nSometimes, you're waiting for\nthat text from a client.\n\n410\n00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.260\nSo, I can actually take a text frame,\n\n411\n00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.740\ndraw out the text frame, go to my\nselection tool, click on the out port,\n\n412\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.930\neven though there's no red plus\nbecause there's no text in there.\n\n413\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.460\nJust click on that and\nI have all the same options.\n\n414\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.640\nHold down the Option key or\nthe Alt key and I could thread those.\n\n415\n00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.210\nAnd these things are still threaded,\nthere's just not any text yet.\n\n416\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.950\nSo if I turn on those text threads,\nmake sure we can see those.\n\n417\n00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.290\nThey're actually the select one, when I do\nthat, I can see how those are connected,\n\n418\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.350\neven though there's no text in there.\n\n419\n00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.670\nThat means that if I bring text in,\nit will flow across all the frames.\n\n420\n00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.290\nOr, if I'm just sitting in\nthis text story here and\n\n421\n00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.320\nI do my fill with placeholder text\nkeyboard shortcut, I can click that, and\n\n422\n00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.880\nit fills in all of them because it\nknows that that's one continuous story.\n\n423\n00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.580\nSo that's known as a story,\n\n424\n00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.040\nyou've got a frames but\nthe story can be several frames long.\n\n425\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.460\nI'm gonna delete actually all\nof these cuz this is separate.\n\n426\n00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.559\nI'm wanna pick back up with this story\nthat we left off back on this page and\n\n427\n00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:36.960\nI'm gonna click on the red plus and\n\n428\n00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.870\nI'm gonna open the page pound, so\nyou can kind of see what's happening.\n\n429\n00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.720\nSo we have two pages right now,\nwe have two blank ones as well,\n\n430\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.550\nI am going to come to\nthis blank page three.\n\n431\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:50.380\nActually I am going to start new, delete\npage four or page three really quick.\n\n432\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.540\nSo I have this page ,I have picked\nit up from here, then I am going to\n\n433\n00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.190\ncome over here and I am going to\nhold down the shift key this time.\n\n434\n00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.100\nWhat the shift key does is it gives us\nthat same serpentine but it's solid.\n\n435\n00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.050\nIt's not partially dashed like\nthe other one, and what that is,\n\n436\n00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.090\nthat's complete auto flow.\n\n437\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.400\nSo when I hold on to that,\nit's gonna fill it to the margins, and\n\n438\n00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.790\nthen it's going to add pages as necessary\nuntil that entire story is placed.\n\n439\n00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.120\nSo if you know you have your guide set\nup and you always know exactly, or\n\n440\n00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.930\nyou know that the margins are set up and\n\n441\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:23.360\nyou just wanna flow the text across the\npages, you can just do this on page one.\n\n442\n00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.780\nJust go ahead and place that and\nit just flows through.\n\n443\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.530\nBut the reason I opened the pages\npanel is so you can see what happens.\n\n444\n00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.870\nWe're actually gonna see pages\nbeing added and filled in as well.\n\n445\n00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.990\nHold down the shift key and I'm gonna\nclick and it's gonna fill it to the right\n\n446\n00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.490\nand to the bottom margin and\nit's gonna add pages until it's all done.\n\n447\n00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.700\nSo it does that, I go scroll down\nhere to the very last page and\n\n448\n00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.380\nthere's the end of the story.\n\n449\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.580\nSo it went ahead and\nfilled that entire thing for me.\n\n450\n00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.410\nSo you can see how threading the text\nframes is really quick and easy to do.\n\n451\n00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.400\nI'm gonna undo do that, when I do that,\nit's also gonna delete all those pages\n\n452\n00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.430\nbecause I just stepped backwards and\ngot rid of all of those.\n\n453\n00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.870\nSo the text threads, let's come\nback here to these text threads and\n\n454\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.280\nit doesn't matter that I don't\nhave the whole story placed.\n\n455\n00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.720\nBut what that is, is always keeping track\nof which text frame is next in the thread.\n\n456\n00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.000\nSo the cool things is I can do things\nlike take this frame and delete it.\n\n457\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.420\nAnd when I do,\nit doesn't sever the story there,\n\n458\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.060\nI delete it and\nit says you must wanna just go ahead and\n\n459\n00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.150\nkeep continuing with what was there,\nso it doesn't break it.\n\n460\n00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.590\nIt's like a chain link fence and pull it\none link and it's self-repairs itself,\n\n461\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.030\nit just comes in and fixes and\n\n462\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.510\nsays let's just keep this chain going,\nit just gets rid of it.\n\n463\n00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:33.040\nThe cool thing is I can also\nput a frame back in as well.\n\n464\n00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.190\nIf I decide, I really want\nan extra text frame over here,\n\n465\n00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:40.130\nI can draw this text frame,\ndraw it out and\n\n466\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.970\nthen use my selection tool to select\nthe frame I want it to start in.\n\n467\n00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.956\nAnd click the out port button and\nI am going to roll over this one and\n\n468\n00:23:46.956 --> 00:23:50.536\nI am get this kind of this chain link icon\nthat is there, and roll over that, and\n\n469\n00:23:50.536 --> 00:23:53.952\nI click into it, and when I do that it\ndoesnt end there, it picks it back up,\n\n470\n00:23:53.952 --> 00:23:57.593\nit says, you were inserting that chain\nlink, that little link into there.\n\n471\n00:23:57.593 --> 00:24:00.503\nGreat, so you can add and\nsubtract from there, easily.\n\n472\n00:24:00.503 --> 00:24:03.976\nIf I want to break the frame though,\nor a break it here.\n\n473\n00:24:03.976 --> 00:24:07.144\nAnd on this first frame and everything\nelse will be kind of left behind.\n\n474\n00:24:07.144 --> 00:24:10.490\nI can click on the import for\nthe second story here.\n\n475\n00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.620\nI'm gonna click on that and\nroll over it and let's zoom in so\n\n476\n00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.740\nyou can actually see that and\nit changes to that broken link icon.\n\n477\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.480\nSo it says,\nyou wanna break the link there?\n\n478\n00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.340\nYes I do.\n\n479\n00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.730\nWe break that there.\n\n480\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:25.540\nWhen I do that, all these now become empty\nand that's because I severed the link.\n\n481\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.660\nLink is there, the story is still there\nit's just all hiding in the end of here,\n\n482\n00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.570\nI gotta pick it up from here and\nstart linking it whether it's,\n\n483\n00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:36.030\nam linking it up to existing frames,\nor if I start drawing out new ones.\n\n484\n00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.170\nRight?\nSo the same thing.\n\n485\n00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.720\nSo linking is easy to put together and\nto pull apart as well.\n\n486\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.850\nNow, last thing with the text and\n\n487\n00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.560\nthe text flow that I wanna show,\nis, some of the other options.\n\n488\n00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.600\nI'm sorry, I don't want to do the options.\n\n489\n00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.820\nI want to show you smart text re-flow.\n\n490\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.770\nThat is something that\nwas just introduced,\n\n491\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.490\nI don't even know how many versions ago.\n\n492\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.430\nIt is fairly new.\n\n493\n00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.780\nI'm going to show you an option for\nit first, in the preferences.\n\n494\n00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.630\nCommand or\nControl + K brings up your preferences.\n\n495\n00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:07.300\nUnder \"In Design\" menu on the Mac and\nunder the \"Edit\" menu on PCs.\n\n496\n00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:12.230\nAnd I want to come down to,\ntype, and I can't remember,\n\n497\n00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.200\nit's type and advanced type.\n\n498\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.820\nI can't remember if that's advanced or\nnot.\n\n499\n00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.810\nIt's not, it's under type, down at\nthe bottom, it's called Smart text reflow.\n\n500\n00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.840\nAnd this basically will add and\nsubtract pages as you have text.\n\n501\n00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.500\nAnd if you're coming from Word,\nyou think big deal.\n\n502\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.490\nWord's always had this, and it's true.\n\n503\n00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.000\nIt's something that's fairly\nnew in InDesign because\n\n504\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.560\nthey're adding in more and more word\nprocessing type of features into InDesign.\n\n505\n00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.320\nSo, in this case,\nsmart text reflow is that.\n\n506\n00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.180\nI can limit it to primary text frames,\nwe'll talk about that in a future episode\n\n507\n00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.930\nof text frames,\nthat has something to do with master pages\n\n508\n00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.440\nI'm going to deselect that because\nI don't have that in this document.\n\n509\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.390\nI want it to be any frames,\nnot just primary text frames.\n\n510\n00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.490\nI also tell it delete empty pages.\n\n511\n00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.770\nWhat that is going to do,\nas I ad text, as I get more and\n\n512\n00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:59.020\nmore text,\nit's going to add pages to that document.\n\n513\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.360\nSo, if I come in here,\nmake sure I have nothing on this page,\n\n514\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.950\nI am going to bring in, new text.\n\n515\n00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:07.670\nAnd I'm gonna bring in that same text that\nwe just had, and I'm gonna tell it \"okay\".\n\n516\n00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:12.179\nAnd all I'm gonna do is draw out\nthe frame, just like I did before.\n\n517\n00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.180\nFor this text frame and let go.\n\n518\n00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.990\nAnd I'm gonna sit there and\nthen nothing happens.\n\n519\n00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.590\nThe thing with smart reflow is you\nhave to sort of kick start it I guess.\n\n520\n00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:28.100\nYou have to have at least two pages that\nhave one linked story for it to start.\n\n521\n00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.950\nAnd that's maybe because if you put that\ndown there and it just added pages and\n\n522\n00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:32.620\nlinked it all together\nit would frighten you.\n\n523\n00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.650\nI don't know why it works that way,\nbut it does.\n\n524\n00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.790\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto do the same thing we just did,\n\n525\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.100\nadd a page, and drag this out.\n\n526\n00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:45.290\nThen when I let go, we will see\nthat the pages will add hopefully,\n\n527\n00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.540\nsomewhere along the way.\n\n528\n00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.300\nThere we go.\nIt takes a little while sometimes.\n\n529\n00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.260\nBut it went ahead and added it.\n\n530\n00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.730\nI just added one, but because I had those\ntwo pages with one linked textframe,\n\n531\n00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:59.190\nit says you must want to add that, and\nadd the pages as necessary and fill it in.\n\n532\n00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.780\nHere's the cool thing though, let's take\nthe end of this story and just delete it.\n\n533\n00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.700\nThat's on page 15, you can see down here,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n534\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.440\ndelete everything up to that paragraph,\nand\n\n535\n00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.840\nI delete it And as soon as I do that,\npage 15 went away.\n\n536\n00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.800\nSo it's not even there.\n\n537\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.390\nSo it says, it deletes empty pages.\n\n538\n00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.020\nSo it knows when you need a page,\nit adds it, and\n\n539\n00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.500\nif you don't need it, it deletes it.\n\n540\n00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.560\nNow this is really cool if you're doing,\nsay a large catalogue layout,\n\n541\n00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.130\nit's nice cuz it'll add pages\nto the section for you.\n\n542\n00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:26.620\nBut it is something you\nneed to be aware of,\n\n543\n00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.210\nthat if you start deleting\nthings earlier in the section,\n\n544\n00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.630\nyou might not realize that it\nactually deleted a page on you.\n\n545\n00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:35.630\nSo it's one of those things that is great,\nbut takes a lot of responsibility.\n\n546\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.060\nWhat is it Spiderman says, you know?\n\n547\n00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.550\nWith great power comes\ngreat responsibility.\n\n548\n00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.640\nAnd that's one of those cases in\nInDesign where that is absolutely true.\n\n549\n00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.370\nSo that's smart text reflow.\n\n550\n00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:45.900\n>> All right.\n\n551\n00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.910\nWell we appreciate you taking\nthe time to show us that, Erica.\n\n552\n00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:50.900\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n553\n00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.460\nHowever, before we sign off,\n\n554\n00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.600\ndo you have any additional words\nyou wanna throw in about text?\n\n555\n00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.740\n>> Nope, just know where your text threads\nare because sometimes it's hard to keep\n\n556\n00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.620\ntrack of them.\n\n557\n00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.490\n>> All right, very good.\n\n558\n00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.300\nWell thank you for\njoining us here in the studios and\n\n559\n00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.630\nthank you to the viewer for watching.\n\n560\n00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.220\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n561\n00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.300\n>> And I'm Erica Gamut.\n\n562\n00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.431\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n563\n00:28:08.431 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:11.973 --> 00:00:14.878\nWelcome back to another exciting\nepisode here at at ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:18.974\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n4\n00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:21.095\nseries in Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:24.125\nThat's right, more specifically,\nwe're looking at InDesign and\n\n6\n00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:27.140\njoining me back in the studios today\nis none other than Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.220\nErica, how you doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.130\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.850\n>> Great, so we've been going\nthrough our series here on InDesign.\n\n10\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.930\nWhat are we looking at next?\n\n11\n00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.650\n>> Now we're gonna work with tables.\n\n12\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.700\nSo I know that doesn't sound super, super\nexciting, but we're gonna do that anyway.\n\n13\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.590\nIn fact, to get you a little bit more\nexcited about tables than you probably\n\n14\n00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.670\nalready are I'm gonna show\nyou some fun uses for tables.\n\n15\n00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.630\nSo tables, or graphs or charts or\nwhatever we wanna call them,\n\n16\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.810\nor charts I guess, sometimes we always\nthink it's just tabular information, so\n\n17\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.360\njust spreadsheets or\nfinancial information in an annual report.\n\n18\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.710\nBut the great thing is in InDesign,\n\n19\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.250\nif we are doing an annual report,\nwe do need that tabular information.\n\n20\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.290\nBut we can also make it look really cool.\n\n21\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.960\nSo I'm going to actually just jump in and\nshow you some samples of\n\n22\n00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.960\ninteresting tables anyway and\njust different uses for tables.\n\n23\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.730\nI've just got this file here with\njust a bunch of samples in it.\n\n24\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.400\nAnd these are actual tables.\n\n25\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.910\nNow I know they don't actually\nlook like tables and we're gonna\n\n26\n00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.780\nactually build some of these so that you\ncan see what you can do with a table.\n\n27\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.120\nSo in this case, I have this workshop,\nthat little logo,\n\n28\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.560\nthat graphic is actually a table.\n\n29\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.590\nThese two images, these two\npictures are actually in a table.\n\n30\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.640\nBut it just looks like they're two\npicture frames with pictures in them.\n\n31\n00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700\nBut again, that's done as a table.\n\n32\n00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.050\nI jump to the next page, close this\npanel out of my way, and jump to that.\n\n33\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.330\nThat grid is also a table.\n\n34\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.270\nSo I can make that into a table.\n\n35\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.830\nThink how much time this would take if we\nwere just drawing out lines and boxes.\n\n36\n00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.900\nBut if we make this a table and it's blue\nand it's maybe an eighth of an inch.\n\n37\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.730\nAnd the client comes back and\n\n38\n00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.160\nsays, actually I need each of those\ngrid marks to be half an inch,\n\n39\n00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.950\nI can just make one change in the table\nsettings and it changes for me.\n\n40\n00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.870\nThis is also a table.\n\n41\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.227\nSo this is something you may end up having\nto to do a lot when you're working in\n\n42\n00:02:09.227 --> 00:02:09.760\nInDesign.\n\n43\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.230\nNot everything we do is really\nexciting cool advertisements.\n\n44\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.150\nA lot of it, a lot of what I do is\nwhat I like to call grunt work.\n\n45\n00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.260\nBut I like the grunt work.\n\n46\n00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.440\nI like making a really nice looking\nform because forms are everywhere.\n\n47\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.300\nYou have to make forms.\n\n48\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.740\nPeople have to fill out forms.\n\n49\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.150\nThere's no need for them to be boring.\n\n50\n00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.860\nNow this one isn't exactly exciting but\nat least it looks better than just name,\n\n51\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.270\nline, address, line, so I gave it\na little bit of something different.\n\n52\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.580\nWe've got some nice headers.\n\n53\n00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.600\nBut again, this is done in a table.\n\n54\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.950\nNow, why do it in a table instead of just\ndrawing out lines and boxes, is because\n\n55\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.880\nwhen changes happen, and anybody\nthat has a client knows that change\n\n56\n00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.540\nhappens all the time, and not usually\nat the most opportune time, either.\n\n57\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.380\nSo for me, if I set this up in a table and\n\n58\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.390\nI suddenly realize that there isn't enough\nroom for people to write their names.\n\n59\n00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.610\nI need to make it bigger.\n\n60\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.660\nI can, again, across the board\nin one little operation make\n\n61\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.310\nall the lines bigger or all the spaces for\nwriting in bigger because it's in a table.\n\n62\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.990\nBasically anything that has\nto be laid out, I don't know,\n\n63\n00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.030\nlaid out in a nice, organized fashion and\nthat might have changes later,\n\n64\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.900\nI usually see if I can figure\nout a way to do it with a table.\n\n65\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.780\nHere's a table as well.\n\n66\n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.890\nIt just looks like paragraphs with\ncolor shading back behind it.\n\n67\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.260\nAnd that is actually something that they\nintroduced in one of the most recent\n\n68\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.960\nversions of InDesign was that you could\nactually shade a paragraph, which is nice.\n\n69\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.200\nSo if I'm doing this,\nI could probably do that.\n\n70\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.840\nBut I've always done it as a table and\n\n71\n00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.470\nthis way I can also do things\nlike have alternating colors.\n\n72\n00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.040\nAnd when I add a new line,\nmaybe in this case this is a hiking tip.\n\n73\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.690\nSo if I added a new tip that I needed\nto put in here, then when I do it,\n\n74\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.360\nit automatically shades it\nin the new color for me.\n\n75\n00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.610\nBecause that's something that's built into\ntables is this alternating color fill.\n\n76\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.780\nI can't get that with\nthe paragraph shading.\n\n77\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.780\nSo again, tables, all right?\n\n78\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.410\nSo I'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n79\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.910\nthis is actually a sample table\nwe'll work with in a second.\n\n80\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.930\nSo those are just some interesting ideas\nfor tables, but let's actually look at how\n\n81\n00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.350\na table gets into InDesign and\nhow we actually format it in such a way.\n\n82\n00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.180\nAnd sometimes we do have to\ndo just tabular information,\n\n83\n00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.580\nwhich is what we're gonna\ndo here in this final page.\n\n84\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.950\nWe're going to take just this information;\nit's just a schedule of classes.\n\n85\n00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.380\nWe're gonna actually put that into\na table, make that into a table.\n\n86\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.198\nBut I'm just going to create a new page,\nCmd or Ctrl+Shift+P,\n\n87\n00:04:23.198 --> 00:04:26.529\nyou're going to know that keyboard\nshortcut by the time you're done with all\n\n88\n00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:28.080\nthe episodes because I use it a lot.\n\n89\n00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.335\nBecause why go over to the Pages\npanel to make a new page when I can\n\n90\n00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:33.127\njust use that keyboard shortcut.\n\n91\n00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:35.761\n[COUGH] So I'm gonna go ahead and\nstart with this blank page and\n\n92\n00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:36.700\nI want to get a table.\n\n93\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.570\nAnd there's a couple different\nways to get a table into InDesign.\n\n94\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.190\nYou can start with a frame and\nput a table in it.\n\n95\n00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.830\nYou can import a table from\nsomewhere like Excel or Word.\n\n96\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.060\nAnd you can also convert tabbed\ninformation to a table as well.\n\n97\n00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.350\nAnd actually they introduced a new way\nto do it a couple versions ago where you\n\n98\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.220\ndon't have to create a text frame anymore.\n\n99\n00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.160\nThat's what we've always had to do,\n\n100\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.000\nwas create a text frame and depending on\nthe version that you have of InDesign\n\n101\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.870\nyou used to have to create a text frame\nand then insert a table inside it.\n\n102\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.290\nNow there's this special call out that\nwe can just create a table from scratch.\n\n103\n00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.880\nIt works pretty much the same way\nonce we have the table created.\n\n104\n00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.870\nEverything else is the same.\n\n105\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.790\nIt's just how it's created.\n\n106\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.280\nSo I can start with a text frame.\n\n107\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.470\nWhen I'm working with tables,\n\n108\n00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.540\nthe one thing to remember is that\nwe work with the type tool, right?\n\n109\n00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.650\nSo we're always working\nwith the type tool.\n\n110\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.290\nAnd tables are contained in a text frame,\ncuz they are just text.\n\n111\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.990\nBut they're sort of this\nspecial subset of text in here.\n\n112\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.370\nSo I'm gonna just click and\ndrag and draw out a text frame.\n\n113\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.870\nAnd I'm going to turn off my invisibles\nwhich are turned on for some reason.\n\n114\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.200\nAnd I'm going to zoom in so\nwe can see a little bit better.\n\n115\n00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.920\nAnd I can tell it that I want\nto go ahead and insert a table.\n\n116\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.430\nEverything that we need for\ntables is up under the Table menu.\n\n117\n00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.200\nAnd there is a lot of stuff\nunder the Table menu.\n\n118\n00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.570\nAlso I have access to the Table\npanel under the Windows menu.\n\n119\n00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.230\nI can come down to Type in Tables and\nopen the Table menu.\n\n120\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.150\nBut it has a lot of icons, and frankly,\na lot of those don't make any sense\n\n121\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.940\nto me just because the icons\nare pretty specific and\n\n122\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.400\nI think there's a lot of complicated\ninformation you're trying to learn and\n\n123\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.030\ntrying to cram that all into\nan icon that speaks for it.\n\n124\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.320\nTo me, it doesn't make any sense.\n\n125\n00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.530\nBut again, in Adobe products,\nyou tend to have two or\n\n126\n00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.870\nthree different ways to do everything,\nwhatever your preference is.\n\n127\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.840\nBut I'm gonna use the menu for everything,\nand I'm gonna go up to the Table menu and\n\n128\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.220\nchoose Insert Table.\n\n129\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.015\nSo I have a text frame and\nI've inserted it.\n\n130\n00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.207\nAnd I'm gonna show you that you don't\nneed that with the new tool, but\n\n131\n00:06:32.207 --> 00:06:33.560\nthis is the way you've\nalways had to do it.\n\n132\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.860\nIt's kind of the way I still do it a lot,\nbecause I forget that there's a button for\n\n133\n00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.338\nthat and\nI don't need to do it this way anymore.\n\n134\n00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:40.180\nBut I wanna show you that and\n\n135\n00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.140\nthe first thing it asks you is how many\nbody rows and columns do you have.\n\n136\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.620\nThis is the main portion of your table.\n\n137\n00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.710\nSo I can choose how many rows and columns.\n\n138\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.990\nI'm just gonna randomly\nput in some numbers.\n\n139\n00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.860\nI'm not gonna worry about header or\nfooter rows just yet and\n\n140\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.470\nwe're not gonna work with\nstyles at all on that, but\n\n141\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.170\njust know that if you set up a table,\nyou can actually save that to a style.\n\n142\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.761\nSo next time you want\nthat same kind of table,\n\n143\n00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:04.881\nyou can just assign that style to it.\n\n144\n00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:09.111\nSo I'm going to say OK, and it goes\nahead and draws out my eight rows and\n\n145\n00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:10.650\nmy eight columns.\n\n146\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.340\nNow if you've worked with tables before,\na lot of this will seem pretty familiar.\n\n147\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.440\nI'm not going to go over everything in\ntables, but just sort of the basics so you\n\n148\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.520\nfeel comfortable putting a table on the\npage and manipulating it how you need to.\n\n149\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.260\nAnd like I said,\nit's always in a text frame.\n\n150\n00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.550\nBut what you might notice,\nI'm gonna shorten this up.\n\n151\n00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:34.840\nAnd if I shorten it up too far on its\nheight, it will actually get rid the row.\n\n152\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.930\nAnd it will never sever\na row in the middle.\n\n153\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.100\nSo it's gonna go ahead and\ntake out that whole row that doesn't fit.\n\n154\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.210\nAnd I can see if I zoom in over here,\nI can see that I have overset text.\n\n155\n00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.190\nWe saw this in an earlier episode when\nwe were linking text, it's the same way.\n\n156\n00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.805\nI've got overset text.\n\n157\n00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:51.519\nIt says hey,\nthere's more to that table that exists and\n\n158\n00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:55.237\nI can actually link that to a new frame,\nand we'll do that in a little while.\n\n159\n00:07:55.237 --> 00:07:57.593\nBut I just wanna show you\nthat when you shorten it up,\n\n160\n00:07:57.593 --> 00:07:59.370\nit does actually get rid of those rows.\n\n161\n00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:04.251\nHowever if I shorten it up say on the\nright side by dragging in the text frame\n\n162\n00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.060\nhere nothing happens.\n\n163\n00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.980\nThe text frame can actually kind\nof explode out past the side\n\n164\n00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.330\nof the I'm sorry a table can explode\nout past the side of the text frame.\n\n165\n00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.730\nWhy that is I don't know.\n\n166\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.130\nIt's not a huge problem it's just\nsometimes you have a text frame.\n\n167\n00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.650\nYou've made it fit here and\nthe table actually is too big.\n\n168\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.680\nSo if we know that this text\nframe can only be this big and\n\n169\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.480\nthe table needs to fit in there,\nwe need to move into fit.\n\n170\n00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.970\nWhen I'm working with tables remember I\nuse the type tool, even when I'm working\n\n171\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.600\nwith the frames, and the lines and\nthe rows and moving everything around.\n\n172\n00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.800\nSo I'm going to go to the right side and\nI'm going to start dragging to the left,\n\n173\n00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.650\nand when I do that all it's doing\nis dragging that last column.\n\n174\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.350\nWhat I really wanted to do is I want\nto keep all the columns the same.\n\n175\n00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.590\nSo I need to hold down the shift key,\n\n176\n00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.370\nand when I do that all\nthe columns move together.\n\n177\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.830\nAnd I'm just going to bring it in until it\nhits the right side of that text frame.\n\n178\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.690\nSame thing with the bottom row,\nif I want to just pull down the bottom,\n\n179\n00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.080\nif I'm not holding anything but\nthe mouse key.\n\n180\n00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.400\nIt just increases the size of that row.\n\n181\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.600\nIf I hold down the Shift key, however,\nit brings all the rows together, and so\n\n182\n00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.540\nthey're still nice and\nproportional like they were.\n\n183\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.140\nIf I want to move one of the interior\nlines, either a row or a column stroke,\n\n184\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.530\nI can use the Shift key to move just\nthe one, so it kinda works opposite.\n\n185\n00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.880\nShift on the outside\nones moves everything.\n\n186\n00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.670\nShift on the inside ones moves just\nthat the stroke that we're touching.\n\n187\n00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.780\nSo maybe I just want this one\nto be a little bit smaller.\n\n188\n00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.330\nSo I can start arranging how my rows and\n\n189\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.240\ncolumns look in there just\nby moving it back and forth.\n\n190\n00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.370\nThese are all cells.\n\n191\n00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.980\nI'm sure you hopefully know that.\n\n192\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.980\nI mean we're working with tables.\n\n193\n00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.950\nThat's what we're working with,\nindividual cells.\n\n194\n00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.960\nAnd in this case they're just\nall contained in this particular\n\n195\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.380\ntext frame that's here.\n\n196\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.210\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nput my cursor in one of the cells, and\n\n197\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.940\nas I tab through I end up jumping through\nthe different cells that are there.\n\n198\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.876\nOffcourse, when I get to the end,\nit just jumps to the next line.\n\n199\n00:09:50.876 --> 00:09:53.110\nSo just kind of get an idea\nwhat about cells and\n\n200\n00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.280\nwhat all that contains them on this table.\n\n201\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.240\nI am going to actually select\nthe text frame and delete that,\n\n202\n00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.720\nbecause I show you couple other ways\nto make the text fit in the table.\n\n203\n00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.130\nSo under the table menu,\nthe new one is create table.\n\n204\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.390\nSo I didn't need to create a text\nframe and then insert a table,\n\n205\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.260\nthis one I'm just going\nto say create table.\n\n206\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.850\nYou're going to see the same dialogue box,\n\n207\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.700\nworks exactly the same like I said,\nit's just that then when I finish it\n\n208\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.780\nnow I have a loaded place cursor\nthat I can now drag out to size.\n\n209\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:27.000\nSo for me if I've already got a text frame\nthere I've already kind of put one there,\n\n210\n00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.480\nso I know that my table goes there and\n\n211\n00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.270\nhow much space it takes up,\nI would use Insert Table.\n\n212\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:35.310\nAnd this way, it was create a table and\nthen drop it onto the page.\n\n213\n00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.340\nThe other thing I can do\nis I can take Tabbed or\n\n214\n00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.820\nreturned text, and\nchange that into a table.\n\n215\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.740\nSo, I'm just gonna hit tab\nbetween each of these.\n\n216\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.730\nI'm just typing out the letters and\nthe numbers.\n\n217\n00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.550\nAll right, so, I just did a tab.\n\n218\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.570\nI'm gonna turn on the invisible so\nyou can see that.\n\n219\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.680\nI can see,\nthat I have tabs in-between each of those.\n\n220\n00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.540\nAt the end of that first line,\nI have a return.\n\n221\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.850\nAt the end of the last line,\nis a little hash mark, and\n\n222\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.260\nthat means it's just the end of the story.\n\n223\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.120\nI'm going to zoom out of there.\n\n224\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:09.550\nLet's zoom in a little bit I guess,\nso that we can see that.\n\n225\n00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.780\nI'm going to select all that text and turn\noff my invisibles, which is Command or\n\n226\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:19.270\ncontrol and option or alt and\nthen i, or you can go into\n\n227\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:24.960\nedit menu, I'm sorry the type menu and\nshow or hide the hidden characters.\n\n228\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.350\nSo I have that selected, I just want\nto make sure that they were tabbed and\n\n229\n00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.930\nthen I need to tell it this stuff\nhere make that into a table.\n\n230\n00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.740\nSo I'm go into the table menu and\nchoose convert text to table.\n\n231\n00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.980\nSo at any point you can convert\nany text to the table but\n\n232\n00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.950\nthe only way it knows rows and columns, is\nyou have to either tell it if it's a tab,\n\n233\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.540\nor a return, or what it is that\nis the indicator for a new row or\n\n234\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.350\ncolumn, say convert text to table, it asks\nyou right here, and this is the default,\n\n235\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.280\nand this is the one I generally use,\nbut not always.\n\n236\n00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.460\nI'm coming here and\nit says what is the column separator?\n\n237\n00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.000\nWell the tab.\n\n238\n00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.260\nEvery time I hit the tab I want\na new column In my table and\n\n239\n00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.270\nwhen I hit return I want\nit to be a new row.\n\n240\n00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.230\nSo I can go ahead and say okay and\nwhen I do that it went ahead and\n\n241\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.220\nconverted that tab text.\n\n242\n00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.120\nSo that sample that I have of name,\naddress and phone number things like that\n\n243\n00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.340\nhere is how I would that,\nI would type name and I hit return.\n\n244\n00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.910\nBut I'm going to hit return again because\nI want that blank row where people\n\n245\n00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:22.010\nare going to write in their name, so I'm\ngoing to hit return again and then I might\n\n246\n00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.420\ndo address, return, and return, and phone,\nand then city, state, zip and all that.\n\n247\n00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.770\nAnd actually let's do the city,\nstate, and zip,\n\n248\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:33.270\nbecause those are on the same lines,\ncity, tab, state, tab, and zip.\n\n249\n00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.690\nAll right so we put those all together.\n\n250\n00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.190\nI'm going to hit a return and another\nreturn for that one for them to write in.\n\n251\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.820\nThem I'm going to select all that text and\nI'm coming here to the table and\n\n252\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.380\nI'm going to say convert\nthat text to a table.\n\n253\n00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.670\nUsing the same thing,\nnow I have the beginnings of the table.\n\n254\n00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.300\nAnd we're gonna leave that for a sec,\ncuz we're gonna have to come back to that,\n\n255\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.420\ncuz obviously we have too\nmany columns up here.\n\n256\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.430\nWe need to start working with those items,\nbut\n\n257\n00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.330\nthe last thing I wanted to show you is how\nto bring in a table from somewhere else.\n\n258\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.840\nSo I do the Place command, which I've been\ndoing all along, Cmd or Ctrl+D to place,\n\n259\n00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.760\nand we're gonna go out and we're\ngonna choose an actual text file, and\n\n260\n00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.060\nI can see that it looks\nlike it's a table here.\n\n261\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.520\nThis is just a table that\nwas done in Word, and\n\n262\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.570\nI even have a footer here as well.\n\n263\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.000\nSo I can come in here and say, okay,\ngreat, I want this to be a table.\n\n264\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.470\nI'll say Open.\n\n265\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.510\nAnd I can, if I have these options Options\nopen I can choose to strip out everything.\n\n266\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.930\nThat's what I'm gonna do right\nnow is just leave it as is.\n\n267\n00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.830\nAnd I'm gonna bring in this table and\nI'm gonna draw it to the size I need, and\n\n268\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.970\nif it doesn't fit I have to make it fit.\n\n269\n00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.730\nSo in this case, let's come in here and\nlet's make it fit.\n\n270\n00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.750\nI've got that footer that's\ntaking up a little bit of room.\n\n271\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.300\nLet's Zoom out a little, make sure I\ncan get all of that squeezed in there.\n\n272\n00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:43.880\nThere we go.\n\n273\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.490\nAnd, the thing is,\n\n274\n00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.560\nyou notice that footer actually got\ncrammed into that first column.\n\n275\n00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.870\nSo we're gonna have to make\na change to that, as well.\n\n276\n00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.620\nSo how do we do that?\n\n277\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.210\nSo what I want to do,\nis I want to come down here, and\n\n278\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.230\nthe first thing I want to do\nis make sure this footer fits.\n\n279\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.010\nThat's ridiculous,\nthat's not what I wanted it to look like.\n\n280\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.690\nSo, I need to select all of these cells\nthat are here, and I want to make it one,\n\n281\n00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.950\nI'm gonna merge, merge it into one cell.\n\n282\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:10.910\nSo to select a cell, you can either\nput your cursor inside a cell and\n\n283\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.810\ndrag until you select just the one.\n\n284\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.660\nSometimes it's hard though.\n\n285\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.230\nYou select too many or you know,\nyou just get a little bit too jumpy and\n\n286\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.370\nyou grab too much at once.\n\n287\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.510\nSo the easiest way to select one cell,\nis to put your cursor inside the cell, and\n\n288\n00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:27.390\nhit the ESC key, and then suddenly the\nentire cell is selected, but in this case,\n\n289\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.330\nI want to select Select all these cells.\n\n290\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.840\nI can click and drag across all the cells,\nor if I'm choosing whole rows and\n\n291\n00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.610\ncolumns I can just come to the left\nside until I get an arrow,\n\n292\n00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.650\nor the top side if I'm\nworking with columns.\n\n293\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.580\nOr if I want to select the whole table and\nall the text inside it,\n\n294\n00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.280\nI would move to the left and\nget that angled arrow that's there.\n\n295\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.420\nBut in this case I just want the left,\nI just want all that entire row,\n\n296\n00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.700\nand I want to make that one big cell.\n\n297\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.810\nSo I'm going to go up to the table\nmenu and choose merge cells.\n\n298\n00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.880\nWhen I do that,\nnow I've got it all in one cell and\n\n299\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.500\neverything's merged in there perfectly.\n\n300\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.020\nThe other thing that I can do\nis I can make this a footer row,\n\n301\n00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.500\ntell it it's a footer row, and\n\n302\n00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.460\nthe reason that's important is if it\njumps from page to page, if we link this\n\n303\n00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:13.010\nfrom one page to the next, I might want\nmy footer on every page, maybe I don't.\n\n304\n00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.490\nIf I don't, I'm gonna leave it and\n\n305\n00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.360\nit will just appear at the very\nend of the table where it belongs.\n\n306\n00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.640\nBut I might want it to repeat,\nso in this case,\n\n307\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.630\nlet's say we want the header to repeat.\n\n308\n00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.730\nSo if I have this Jumping from one\npage to the next or even two spots on\n\n309\n00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.290\nthe same page, which was what I'm gonna\ndo so we can see it all together.\n\n310\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.480\nIf I close up this table and\nmake it short,\n\n311\n00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.450\nI can see that I've got overset texts.\n\n312\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.080\nI'm gonna click on the outflow just like\nit's any other text frame and then I'm\n\n313\n00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.830\ngonna go ahead and draw out another frame\nhere, and now that table continued on.\n\n314\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.020\nBut if you notice my trail and\ntrailhead and all that isn't here, and\n\n315\n00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.770\nif that's on another page,\nthat might be very difficult to\n\n316\n00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.243\nsee what has that header, what was that\ncolumn that we were talking about.\n\n317\n00:15:55.243 --> 00:15:58.582\nSo I can tell it, that's a header row,\nand if I do that,\n\n318\n00:15:58.582 --> 00:16:02.360\nthat header row will be repeated\nevery time there's a header.\n\n319\n00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.239\nSo let's do that, I'm gonna go to\nthe header row at the very beginning.\n\n320\n00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:09.584\nI can just go ahead and click once to\nthe left to select that entire row,\n\n321\n00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:14.050\ngo up into the table menu and\nchoose convert rows to header.\n\n322\n00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.150\nWhen I do that, boom,\nit automatically appeared down here.\n\n323\n00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.820\nNow if I try to make any changes here.\n\n324\n00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.610\nI'm gonna zoom in so we can see that.\n\n325\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.230\nYou can see that there's\na little bit of a lock icon.\n\n326\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.870\nAnd that just says, I can't make any\nchanges to that here because that\n\n327\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.530\ninformation actually all lives up above.\n\n328\n00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.440\nSomehow I got a another\nline underneath it,\n\n329\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.676\nthere must be some styling\nhere that's left behind.\n\n330\n00:16:35.676 --> 00:16:38.310\nThere's some things like with\nthe cell styles and the table styles,\n\n331\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.880\nwhich we're not gonna go into.\n\n332\n00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.020\nBut it's a little jumpy at times.\n\n333\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.530\nAnd things just get let behind.\n\n334\n00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.730\nSo I find I'm constantly clearing out\nsaying none, no styles, no styles,\n\n335\n00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.080\nno styles to back up and\nget rid of anything.\n\n336\n00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.230\nSo where that underline\ncame from is beyond me.\n\n337\n00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.590\nIt was not there, I don't think\nI didn't see it there earlier.\n\n338\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.450\nSo I've told that, that's a header row.\n\n339\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.400\nNow anything I do to this particular\n\n340\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.850\ntext in this header row will be repeated\neverywhere that table starts over again.\n\n341\n00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:09.090\nIf I jumped it to 20 separate pages,\neach page will have that header row and\n\n342\n00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:10.960\nall the styling that I add here.\n\n343\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.450\nLet's actually add some styling.\n\n344\n00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.630\nI'm gonna start with the header row.\n\n345\n00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.470\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust change the text.\n\n346\n00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:20.720\nWhen I'm working with the text,\nI'm just going to use the character style\n\n347\n00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.570\njust like I would if it was\ntext sitting in a text frame.\n\n348\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.110\nI'm just opening up my\ncharacter panel here.\n\n349\n00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:33.820\nI might tell it, great, let's make it\nactive grotesque and let's do bold.\n\n350\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:38.102\nSo it is really obvious, so\nput that in there and so that's bold.\n\n351\n00:17:38.102 --> 00:17:42.238\nNow I can do any styling like I said that\nI would normally do with the character\n\n352\n00:17:42.238 --> 00:17:46.660\npanel, but\nI can also work with paragraph styling.\n\n353\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.070\nAnd each of those is kinda like each\ncell is its little own little paragraph,\n\n354\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.290\nits not like each row actually\nbecomes a paragraph, but\n\n355\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.690\neach cell also works that way.\n\n356\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.580\nSo for instance,\nif I'm in the paragraph setting.\n\n357\n00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.790\nI come over here,\nlet's go over here to paragraph, and\n\n358\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.770\nI tell it that I want to make it centered.\n\n359\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.030\nWhen I do that it centers each one.\n\n360\n00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.907\nIt doesn't take all the text and\n\n361\n00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:10.720\ncenter it together,\neach one is centered within the cell.\n\n362\n00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.549\nSo that alignment is how it\nrelates to the cell that's there.\n\n363\n00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.460\nThe same thing when I work with the text\ndown here is if I select all the text here\n\n364\n00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.140\nand I work in the character panel,\n\n365\n00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:25.240\nI'm working with the individual\nletters in the text that's selected.\n\n366\n00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.660\nIf I work with paragraph settings,\nit's how it relates to each frame.\n\n367\n00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.530\nAnd actually, let's turn on the edges, so\n\n368\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.845\nwe can actually see where\nthe edge of our cells are.\n\n369\n00:18:33.845 --> 00:18:37.160\nBecause one thing that I notice is\nthat all my text is butted up against\n\n370\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.170\nthat cell.\n\n371\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:42.600\nNow because I don't have any lines\napplies to it, any strokes it looks fine.\n\n372\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.990\nAnd again this is something\nI could achieve with tabs.\n\n373\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.420\nBut changing everything together\nat one time is kind of a pain.\n\n374\n00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.020\nIf I decide everything needs to be\na little bit wider I've got to go in and\n\n375\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.790\nchange all my tabs.\n\n376\n00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:58.770\nSo if I do it as a table, I can just\ngrab that end, like we just did and\n\n377\n00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.500\nwe shortened it up or lengthened it.\n\n378\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.770\nI just grab the end and pull it and\nall the cells become wider at once.\n\n379\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.240\nSo that's why I like to use a table for\nthat instead of tabs.\n\n380\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.300\nBecause when it comes to those\nchanges it's super easy to\n\n381\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.580\nkeep making changes to that.\n\n382\n00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.270\nSo what I want to do is, I want to make\nsure that this is a little bit smaller.\n\n383\n00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.340\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n384\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.290\nAnd I'll just make this\nmaybe 10 point instead.\n\n385\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.940\nAnd if you notice, as I'm doing\nthat it's shrinking up the text and\n\n386\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.730\nalso the size of the rows.\n\n387\n00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.080\nBecause of the settings\nthat are there by default.\n\n388\n00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.010\nSo what I want to do is I want to\nmake sure I select all my text.\n\n389\n00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.350\nI only selected the text that\nwas showing in that first table,\n\n390\n00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.970\nI'm going to select all of it and\nmake that 10 point.\n\n391\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.170\nAnd when I do that,\neach row again gets shorter.\n\n392\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.280\nI even ended up with an extra row showing\nup in that first frame because I made\n\n393\n00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.250\nthat shorter.\n\n394\n00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.060\nBut I also want to make sure that\nthe text is not butted up against\n\n395\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.020\nthe side of that stroke.\n\n396\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.200\nEspecially if I decide to add\na stroke to it that we actually see,\n\n397\n00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.750\nit's going to look terrible.\n\n398\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.570\nIn fact, let's do that so\n\n399\n00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.210\nwe can actually see it instead of\nthe blue lines that are there.\n\n400\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.760\nSo when I want to work with fills and\nstrokes,\n\n401\n00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.100\nI go up under the table menu and\nI come down to cell options.\n\n402\n00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.500\nBecause even when I'm\nworking with the table,\n\n403\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.800\nI'm am telling it what the individual\ncell is or isn't doing.\n\n404\n00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.170\nAnd I go under strokes and fills.\n\n405\n00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.420\nWhen I do that I'm just\ngoing to leave this here.\n\n406\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.675\nI'll show you in a minute what this proxy\nmeans, but right now I'm just going to say\n\n407\n00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:20.480\nokay the weight of that, let's make it\none point and we'll just make it black.\n\n408\n00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.352\nWe'll say okay.\n\n409\n00:20:21.352 --> 00:20:23.935\nSo now when I do that,\nand I put the preview on,\n\n410\n00:20:23.935 --> 00:20:27.850\nit is not showing up as 1 point black,\nlet's fix that there.\n\n411\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.400\nCome down here, go back to table,\nto cell options, strokes and\n\n412\n00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.580\nfills, 1 point black because I did\nnot tell it what type of line.\n\n413\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.460\nA solid line is what I would like please.\n\n414\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.990\nNow I can actually see that, and\n\n415\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.290\nI can see that that text is still butted\nup against there and that's no good.\n\n416\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.180\nAnd now I've made a thicker\nstroke it's even closer, so\n\n417\n00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.270\nwe wanna make a change to that.\n\n418\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.640\nI'm gonna go up under the table menu\nagain, the cell options again and\n\n419\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.170\ngo to text.\n\n420\n00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.660\nWhile we can do some things\nwith the character panel and\n\n421\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.560\nsome things with the paragraph panel,\nthere are some things that are very\n\n422\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.920\nspecific to tables as well including\nhow far inside the cell that offset is.\n\n423\n00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.230\nRight now, there is a little bit of\nan offset on the top and bottom.\n\n424\n00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.720\nBut not on the right and left.\n\n425\n00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.110\nAnd that's because this setting is\nturned off, make all settings the same.\n\n426\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.620\nI'm gonna make all settings exactly\nthe same now and click on that.\n\n427\n00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.250\nAnd now if I turn on preview,\nI can see that it went ahead and\n\n428\n00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.985\ngave me that offset that's there.\n\n429\n00:21:19.985 --> 00:21:21.985\nI can also tell it how to align the text.\n\n430\n00:21:21.985 --> 00:21:25.205\nRight now it's align to the bottom and\nsitting on the bottom of each cell.\n\n431\n00:21:25.205 --> 00:21:26.615\nMaybe I wanna center it vertically.\n\n432\n00:21:26.615 --> 00:21:29.305\nSo, this is up and down I can see\nthat the text is centered vertically.\n\n433\n00:21:29.305 --> 00:21:32.740\nThe other thing I did is I only\nselected the text in this first frame,\n\n434\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.460\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n435\n00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.550\nI wanna make sure I select all the text.\n\n436\n00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.690\nSo I'm holding down the shift key and\ngrabbing all that.\n\n437\n00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.200\nWe need to finish grabbing that, going\nto the cell options, to the text panel.\n\n438\n00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.490\nAnd do the same thing.\n\n439\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.300\nLet's make all settings the same.\n\n440\n00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.450\nAnd let's make this centered.\n\n441\n00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.080\nI'll say okay.\n\n442\n00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.170\nSo we do that.\nNow it looks pretty good.\n\n443\n00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.040\nI can give it a little bit\nmore offset if I want.\n\n444\n00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.700\nAnd when I do that,\nit will actually make the row even bigger.\n\n445\n00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.600\nWhat I can do though,\nif I don't want it to grow and shrink,\n\n446\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.680\nand I just know exactly how\nbig I want the cell to be,\n\n447\n00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.200\neven if my text becomes smaller,\nI can force that into a cell.\n\n448\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.260\nSo I'm just grabbing this row, and what\nI'm going to do is the second item here,\n\n449\n00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.030\nthe Alpine Visitor Center,\nI'm gonna delete one of the words.\n\n450\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.560\nSo that I still have just the two but\n\n451\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.800\nI'm going to keep it the size that it is\ninstead of it shrinking up, which is what\n\n452\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.020\nwould normally happen, because it's\ngrowing and shrinking with the text.\n\n453\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.920\nI'm going to tell it don't do that, I know\nexactly how big I want my cells to be.\n\n454\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:34.290\nSo go back under the table under cell\noptions and come down to rows and columns\n\n455\n00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.400\nand here I'm telling it what the size is,\nthis is the size that's already there.\n\n456\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.340\nIt says at least that size, well, I can\ntell it exactly that size, all right?\n\n457\n00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.730\nSo it's exactly the size it needs to be,\nand\n\n458\n00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.460\nI can tell it I can make\nit exactly smaller, bigger.\n\n459\n00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.460\nWell let's make it bigger\nbecause we had too much there.\n\n460\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.050\nSo let's say that's the size\nI want it to be exactly that,\n\n461\n00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.775\nI can even set the maximum\nat exactly the same.\n\n462\n00:22:55.775 --> 00:23:01.480\nSay it's exactly 0.625 inches tall and\nmaximum of that size.\n\n463\n00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.500\nI can even set a column\nwidth if I want to as well.\n\n464\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.380\nI'm gonna say okay to that.\n\n465\n00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.080\nNow it doesn't matter.\n\n466\n00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.900\nIf this gets shorter, if I select\nthis text, just the word center and\n\n467\n00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.190\ndelete it, it didn't shrink up because I\ntold it exactly how big I want it to be.\n\n468\n00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.390\nAnd that came in handy in something\nlike back here at the very beginning\n\n469\n00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.640\nwith this I just told it hey,\nthis is actually just a four by two cell.\n\n470\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.420\nI selected everything.\n\n471\n00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.290\nWhen I did that, you noticed it inverted\nall the colors when you select it.\n\n472\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.740\nThat's something you have to get used to\nwhen you're working with tables is that\n\n473\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.560\nwhen it selects it, it automatically\nwants to show you it in reverse.\n\n474\n00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.840\nSo just get used to that.\n\n475\n00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.250\nYou could open up a second version of\nthat same document if you want, and\n\n476\n00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.570\ntile it using this up here.\n\n477\n00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.254\nI can tile it and arrange those documents,\nso I can work in one and\n\n478\n00:23:43.254 --> 00:23:44.467\nsee the results in another.\n\n479\n00:23:44.467 --> 00:23:49.389\nBut back to this table, I can come over\nhere and I can say go up under table and\n\n480\n00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:50.889\nagain I laid this out.\n\n481\n00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:52.601\nAnd I think, okay it looks good,\n\n482\n00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:55.973\nand then I realize I want the letters\nto be in a different size box.\n\n483\n00:23:55.973 --> 00:23:59.639\nSo I come here to the rows and columns,\nand instead of it being exactly 1 inch,\n\n484\n00:23:59.639 --> 00:24:02.120\nlet's make it 3/4 of an inch.\n\n485\n00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.260\nAnd I'm also gonna tell it the column\nwidth is also 3/4 of an inch.\n\n486\n00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.020\nSo when I do that,\neverything gets shorter, and\n\n487\n00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.170\nI have a background color to the table for\nsome reason.\n\n488\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.160\nLet's actually get rid of that.\n\n489\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.642\nI don't know why that's\nthere to the frame,\n\n490\n00:24:14.642 --> 00:24:16.325\nthe frame had a color assigned to it,\nnot sure why.\n\n491\n00:24:16.325 --> 00:24:19.674\nAnd then if you find this annoying,\nthat this is hanging out there and\n\n492\n00:24:19.674 --> 00:24:22.327\nwe made is shorter,\nwe wanted to kind of group up to it,\n\n493\n00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:26.300\nI can double-click on this lower right\nhand corner, and it snaps up into place.\n\n494\n00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.450\nIf I hit it just right,\nit snaps up into place, so\n\n495\n00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.090\nthat the frame is not kind\nof just hanging out there.\n\n496\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.380\nIt's kind of hard to find sometimes when\nyou've got a really large text frame like\n\n497\n00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.160\nthat or the table is hanging outside\nthe text frame and things get overlapped.\n\n498\n00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.990\nIt's hard to see where that's coming in.\n\n499\n00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.480\nSo let's actually go back to this,\nI wanna show you the color field.\n\n500\n00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.441\nSo we've actually got individual cells,\nso each cell, I'm gonna hit Escape, so\n\n501\n00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:50.770\nthat just that one cell is selected,\njust the W.\n\n502\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.954\nAnd I can see what color the frame is.\n\n503\n00:24:52.954 --> 00:25:00.050\nSo I can either go into here,\nTable > Cell Options > Strokes and Fills.\n\n504\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.270\nAnd fill in what the stroke is here.\n\n505\n00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.140\nOr I can just use the control panel.\n\n506\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.290\nOr if my color swatches are open,\nI can just grab a swatch and\n\n507\n00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.270\ndrag it on top of a cell, so\nI can just do that as well.\n\n508\n00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.630\nSo if I just want this to go here,\n\n509\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:16.460\nboom, I can color each cell\nindividually easily that way as well.\n\n510\n00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.580\nHow did we do stuff like this,\nthe graphics in here?\n\n511\n00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.830\nWell, putting a graphic in a cell,\nit used to be really difficult.\n\n512\n00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.210\nThey've made it a lot easier,\nthey have a new tool for doing that.\n\n513\n00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.168\nLet's come down here.\n\n514\n00:25:29.168 --> 00:25:33.660\nLet's actually do right in here,\nand we're gonna go ahead and\n\n515\n00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.910\nput a graphic inside the cell.\n\n516\n00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:41.110\nI'm just gonna do a simple table,\njust a 2 by 2.\n\n517\n00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.150\nCreate the table, 2 by 2,\nput that in there.\n\n518\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.966\nDrag this out, and I'm gonna go ahead and\nput an image in there.\n\n519\n00:25:47.966 --> 00:25:50.920\nBut what I wanna do first is I\nwanna select all the cells, so\n\n520\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.030\nI just come up here and select all those.\n\n521\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.160\nAnd I wanna set a couple options first.\n\n522\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.050\nUnder the Table menu,\ncome into Cell Options > Text.\n\n523\n00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.570\nAnd I wanna turn off this offset,\nI wanna make sure the offset is 0.\n\n524\n00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.220\nOtherwise, we're gonna have a gap\nbefore the image, where the image is,\n\n525\n00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.880\nthere's gonna be a gap\nbetween the stroke and that.\n\n526\n00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.890\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust tell it none,\n\n527\n00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:15.340\nand then I also wanna tell it to\nclip the contents to the cell.\n\n528\n00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.570\nSo like the table can run\noutside the text frame,\n\n529\n00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.690\nan image can run over to\nthe right side of a cell.\n\n530\n00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.890\nSo if it's too big, it's just\ngonna run over into the next cell,\n\n531\n00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.370\nwhich might not be what we're looking for.\n\n532\n00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.900\nIf I tell it Clip Contents,\nit will clip it at the end.\n\n533\n00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.450\nIt will automatically clip it\nat the bottom, though, and so\n\n534\n00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:32.800\nI can go ahead and say OK.\n\n535\n00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.910\nNow I know that's all set up, so\n\n536\n00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.890\nthat when I put an image in here, I just\nhave my cursor in here, do Cmd or Ctrl+D.\n\n537\n00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.930\nAnd basically, what we're doing is\nwe're creating an inline graphic,\n\n538\n00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.870\nwhich we did in an earlier episode.\n\n539\n00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:45.730\nWe're putting an image\ninside a text frame.\n\n540\n00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.570\nIt's just this text frame\nalso lives inside a table,\n\n541\n00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:49.730\nwhich is inside a text frame.\n\n542\n00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.380\nI know it gets confusing,\nit's like Inception.\n\n543\n00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.250\nBut I can come in here and\njust drop that item in there.\n\n544\n00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.410\nSo I'm gonna go find one of\nthe pictures that we have.\n\n545\n00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.450\nWe'll just drop in a photo.\n\n546\n00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.100\nCome in here.\n\n547\n00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.210\nLet's grab a cactus.\n\n548\n00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:02.370\nWe haven't looked at a cactus lately.\n\n549\n00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.240\nWe'll do that, and\nI'll turn off the import options,\n\n550\n00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.390\nand I just want to drop right inside and\nlet go.\n\n551\n00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.060\nAnd now that image fits\nright inside there.\n\n552\n00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.500\nNow I can select this,\njust like any other image.\n\n553\n00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.000\nI can move it around.\n\n554\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.830\nSometimes once you get it inside a frame,\n\n555\n00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.150\nit's a little more difficult\nto make changes to it.\n\n556\n00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.270\nI saw they've made some changes.\n\n557\n00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.090\nIt's a bit easier than it used to be.\n\n558\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:26.650\nBut it used to be kind of difficult to\nget it once you put it in there to make\n\n559\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.024\nchanges to the size.\n\n560\n00:27:28.024 --> 00:27:32.003\nSo what I have always done and find that\nI don't need to as much anymore is I\n\n561\n00:27:32.003 --> 00:27:35.752\ntend to place the image on top of\nthe table, just kind of on top of it.\n\n562\n00:27:35.752 --> 00:27:38.820\nGet it to size, get it pretty good,\nand then I copy that or\n\n563\n00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.780\ncut that to the paste board, and\nthen paste it inside, so that I know.\n\n564\n00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.430\nInstead of pasting it and\nrealizing your image is this big, and\n\n565\n00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:49.440\nit's off the edge of the screen and trying\nto size it down within a table cell,\n\n566\n00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.260\nI just find that a little difficult.\n\n567\n00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.430\nSo yeah, so\nwe can jump these across the board.\n\n568\n00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.900\nWe can do some setup to this.\n\n569\n00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.715\nLet's actually do that,\nI wanna merge these.\n\n570\n00:27:57.715 --> 00:27:59.780\nCuz we didn't finish this guy here.\n\n571\n00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.453\nI'm gonna reset my workspace really\nquickly, so everything goes back nicely.\n\n572\n00:28:03.453 --> 00:28:05.550\nAnd we need to merge these\nitems that are here.\n\n573\n00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:10.270\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and select all of\nthese and say, merge those cells, and\n\n574\n00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.030\ndo the same here.\n\n575\n00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.540\nUnfortunately, you have to do each one,\nbecause if I say merge,\n\n576\n00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.660\nif I grab two rows and the merge,\nit will make one large cell.\n\n577\n00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.730\nAnd we don't wanna do that.\n\n578\n00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.440\nThere actually is a script for that\nthat lets you select multiple rows and\n\n579\n00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.990\njust say merge all the columns.\n\n580\n00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.010\nSo I would merge all those.\n\n581\n00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.060\nI'm not gonna take time\nto merge all of them, but\n\n582\n00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.355\nI can see that I can merge each one,\nand now I have my individual lines.\n\n583\n00:28:28.355 --> 00:28:32.000\nAnd now when it says I wanna make these\nbigger, so I can come back here and\n\n584\n00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.110\nmake these bigger if I want.\n\n585\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.800\nAnd then maybe I want these to be smaller.\n\n586\n00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.250\nWell, the nice thing is,\nI can always just pull that up, and\n\n587\n00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.090\nit will stop, because it won't let me\nget rid of that text that's there.\n\n588\n00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.035\nIt says, it's gonna stop when\nI hit that particular text.\n\n589\n00:28:44.035 --> 00:28:47.585\nSo for me, what I do is I set the big one\nsometimes, and then I come back here,\n\n590\n00:28:47.585 --> 00:28:49.665\njust pull that up because I don't\nreally have to think about it.\n\n591\n00:28:49.665 --> 00:28:52.955\nIt stops it when it hits the text,\nand I think that looks pretty nice,\n\n592\n00:28:52.955 --> 00:28:56.510\neven if I have to come back and\nrearrange the size of these frames again.\n\n593\n00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.612\nSo again, I'm gonna do it as tabs.\n\n594\n00:28:58.612 --> 00:29:00.510\nI'm gonna create a table from that, and\n\n595\n00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.870\nthen I'm gonna start getting rid\nof what I do and don't need.\n\n596\n00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.190\nNow if I, at some point, decide,\n\n597\n00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:10.230\nI actually needed something else here in\nthe state, I can select that entire cell,\n\n598\n00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:15.070\nand then I can come up to the table menu\nand split that horizontally or vertically.\n\n599\n00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:18.090\nSo I can split that, and\nnow I have an extra row to work with.\n\n600\n00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.893\nNow I can grab this,\nholding down the Shift key, and\n\n601\n00:29:20.893 --> 00:29:22.944\nI can move that only to the next point.\n\n602\n00:29:22.944 --> 00:29:25.710\nNotice I can move that through there,\nI can't jump over.\n\n603\n00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.560\nI can move it anywhere in that\noriginal cell that I split, but\n\n604\n00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.740\nI can't get it to go outside of that.\n\n605\n00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:36.460\nSo sometimes when you're setting up\nyour table using tab text to start with,\n\n606\n00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.860\nthink about how many times\nyou have to tab over and\n\n607\n00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.170\nwhere all you're gonna\nneed your vertical lines.\n\n608\n00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.840\nAlthough for me, I tend to do this, if I\nknew I just needed one extra here, and\n\n609\n00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.790\nit doesn't need, say, an extra line,\nI just needed some more information here,\n\n610\n00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.190\nI'm gonna cheat and\nI'm just gonna set up a tab inside there.\n\n611\n00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:56.010\nNow I can't just hit Tab because when\nI do that, it tabs to the next frame.\n\n612\n00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.610\nSo what I need to do if I actually\nwanna work with a tab, and\n\n613\n00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:02.400\nI want some text over here, I have to\nhold down the Option or the Alt key.\n\n614\n00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.440\nAnd it tabs it and then I can put\nwhatever extra info needs to go in here.\n\n615\n00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.170\nWhen I select this text and\n\n616\n00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:13.490\nbring up the Tabs panel, you notice it\njust works with that particular cell.\n\n617\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.840\nSo again, it's kinda like a paragraph\ninside that text frame that's here.\n\n618\n00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.910\nAnd I can set where\nthat tab actually sits.\n\n619\n00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:23.230\nAnd if you're not working with strokes and\nfills, you don't need to even worry about\n\n620\n00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.695\nnecessarily getting those\nextra lines that are there.\n\n621\n00:30:26.695 --> 00:30:30.200\nI, a lot of times, if I don't have the\nextra lines that I need, I will cheat and\n\n622\n00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.360\njust use the tabs that are inside there,\nbecause again, it saves me so\n\n623\n00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.350\nmuch more time down the line.\n\n624\n00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:40.140\nOne of the things I can do on the table\nsettings, I choose the entire table,\n\n625\n00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.460\nthe upper left, I click on that, I can\ncome in here to the table settings and\n\n626\n00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.770\ndo Table Options.\n\n627\n00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.610\nAnd I can alternate either the strokes or\nthe fills, and I'm gonna alternate\n\n628\n00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:52.140\nthe fills really quickly, and\nI'm gonna say alternate every other row.\n\n629\n00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.460\nLet's turn on the preview, so we can see\nthat, and I can alternate every other row.\n\n630\n00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.480\nThe first row and the next rows, I can\ntell it, let's say it's black 20%, and\n\n631\n00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.130\nthen let's make it yellow for the next.\n\n632\n00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.285\nAnd I can go ahead and say OK.\n\n633\n00:31:03.285 --> 00:31:05.670\nThere's a lot of other options in there,\nI won't go over all, but\n\n634\n00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.430\nyou can see that you can get\nthis nice alternating pattern.\n\n635\n00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:13.488\nThat's why when I do things like that\ndescription, the tips and tricks here,\n\n636\n00:31:13.488 --> 00:31:17.298\nI do the alternating pattern with that,\nand then that way, if I add a whole\n\n637\n00:31:17.298 --> 00:31:21.378\nnew row, which I can do, I can select\na row here and say, Table > Insert a Row.\n\n638\n00:31:21.378 --> 00:31:23.380\nLet's go ahead and insert one row.\n\n639\n00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:28.940\nWhen I do that, I just do one below that,\nit automatically puts in that new row.\n\n640\n00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:34.070\nAnd it's gonna go ahead and\ngive me the alternating fills from that.\n\n641\n00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.480\nActually, did it do an alternating row?\n\n642\n00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.650\nLet's see, let's go Alternating Fills.\n\n643\n00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:38.900\nI do have alternate, it has two rows.\n\n644\n00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.110\nThat's why, we only want one of each.\n\n645\n00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.380\nIt had two, because I actually,\nwhat I have in here is a little cheat.\n\n646\n00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.610\nI wanted some extra room, so there was\nactually an extra row between each\n\n647\n00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:48.970\nto give me that little\nbit of buffer space.\n\n648\n00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.280\nSo I would have had to\nactually add two rows, so\n\n649\n00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.870\nthat they would actually\ncome into that new color.\n\n650\n00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.090\nBut you can see how easy it is\nto add that in there afterwards.\n\n651\n00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.670\nSo while we're not always working with\ntabular information with a table,\n\n652\n00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.750\nyou can see where having\nthem set up is super easy.\n\n653\n00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:06.380\nSo the very last thing I wanna\nshow you is this sample here.\n\n654\n00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.148\nIf I look at this particular table and I\nselect this and I decide I didn't want it\n\n655\n00:32:10.148 --> 00:32:13.914\nto be in light blue, which doesn't show\nup when you put it, say, on a copier,\n\n656\n00:32:13.914 --> 00:32:16.910\nit's non re-probe blue,\nI want it to be black, but 10%.\n\n657\n00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.900\nI want it to show up, but very fine.\n\n658\n00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.886\nI can change those strokes super,\nsuper easy.\n\n659\n00:32:20.886 --> 00:32:25.102\nI can go up into Table >\nCell Options > Strokes and Fills.\n\n660\n00:32:25.102 --> 00:32:29.158\nAnd I tell it that I want the stroke\nto be, instead of the blue,\n\n661\n00:32:29.158 --> 00:32:31.189\nI want it to be black, 10%.\n\n662\n00:32:31.189 --> 00:32:35.008\nAnd the other thing that I have here\nis this is just sort of a proxy of\n\n663\n00:32:35.008 --> 00:32:38.211\nthe different rows and\ncolumns that we've selected.\n\n664\n00:32:38.211 --> 00:32:42.978\nSo when I have multiple cells selected,\nthese lines are the inside lines, and\n\n665\n00:32:42.978 --> 00:32:46.820\nthese are the outside lines of\nthe actual table that's there.\n\n666\n00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.440\nIt's hard to see, I know, because\neverything's selected, but if I just want\n\n667\n00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.000\nthe inside lines to be affected and not\nthe outside ones, I double click on that.\n\n668\n00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.620\nAnd just those inside ones are selected,\nand\n\n669\n00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.460\nthat's the only change\nI'm making to those.\n\n670\n00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.500\nIf I select the outside ones\nby double-clicking on them,\n\n671\n00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.630\nI can say let's make the outside ones.\n\n672\n00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.210\nLet's make those actually red,\nand they'll actually be thicker.\n\n673\n00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.470\nSo all the outside ones that\nI selected will be red.\n\n674\n00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:09.790\nHopefully, we can see that.\n\n675\n00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.450\nLet's zoom in a little bit.\n\n676\n00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.165\nAnd you can see that the outside\nbecame that 10% red, and\n\n677\n00:33:14.165 --> 00:33:16.900\nthe inside became the 10%\nblack that's there.\n\n678\n00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.630\nSo that's how we change the cells on that.\n\n679\n00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.975\nSo you can see how quickly that works,\ninstead of having all these lines\n\n680\n00:33:21.975 --> 00:33:25.397\ninside a box that we would have to move\nevery time we need to make a change.\n\n681\n00:33:25.397 --> 00:33:28.981\nEspecially when we change it, we decide\nto change the size of the cell width or\n\n682\n00:33:28.981 --> 00:33:32.830\nheight, we can just go into that cell\noptions and make the change there as well.\n\n683\n00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.000\nSo use tables.\n\n684\n00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.670\nThink about where you would use tables\nthat you wouldn't normally think about it.\n\n685\n00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:39.420\nAnd just figure out how you\ncan organize it with a table.\n\n686\n00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.058\nIt makes changes so much easier.\n\n687\n00:33:41.058 --> 00:33:44.640\n>> Erica, thank you for all that great\ninformation on tables, and we hope you're\n\n688\n00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.240\na little bit more prepared if you do have\nto enter in some tabular data yourself.\n\n689\n00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.130\nNow looking at the clock, it does look\nlike we're coming to another episode, but\n\n690\n00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.640\nbefore we do, do you have any additional\ninformation you'd like to put in here?\n\n691\n00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.046\n>> Nope, just use tables, I like them.\n\n692\n00:33:55.046 --> 00:33:56.510\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, very good, well,\n\n693\n00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.400\nwe appreciate you being here in the\nstudios with us, and we appreciate you,\n\n694\n00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.280\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n695\n00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.450\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your

00:00:18.800\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n4\n00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.947\nSeries in Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:24.090\nThat's right we're coming back\nat you with more in design.\n\n6\n00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.590\nAnd joining me back in\nthe studios again is Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.530\nErica how are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.330\n>> Really good.\n\n9\n00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.310\n>> All right, so\nwe're continuing along this journey.\n\n10\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.700\nWhat is the next thing we're\ngoing to be looking at?\n\n11\n00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.220\n>> We're gonna start with layers.\n\n12\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.550\nSo we're gonna start putting\nthings on top of other things.\n\n13\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.560\nSo that's layers right?\n\n14\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.460\nWe're gonna start stacking it.\n\n15\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.680\nIn a previous episode we talked about.\n\n16\n00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.240\nAbout stacking order where we had\nactual objects on top of other objects.\n\n17\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.910\nBut now we're going to go back and\nkind of pull out a little further and\n\n18\n00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.620\nwe're going to do layers.\n\n19\n00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.780\nWe're going to stack layers on top of\neach other, and it's going to make sense.\n\n20\n00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.635\nDon't think of it like Photoshop Layers\nthought, that's where some people come\n\n21\n00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:59.055\nin thinking it's like that, it's sort of\nlike that in that they're layered, but\n\n22\n00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:00.735\nthey don't work in exactly the same way.\n\n23\n00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:03.565\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm actually\ngonna show you a sample first.\n\n24\n00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:07.330\nWe're gonna go ahead and open up a sample\nand I can show you where layers come\n\n25\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.200\nin handy, and why I may or\nmay not want to use layers.\n\n26\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.670\nSo by default, when you first start\na document, you have one layer whether or\n\n27\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.110\nnot you ever notice that.\n\n28\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.580\nSo actually I lied and\nsaid I was gonna show you this.\n\n29\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.230\nLet's actually jump to\nthis other one first.\n\n30\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.700\nAnd I just wanna show you\nwith the Layers panel open\n\n31\n00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.060\nthat I have a layer called Layer 1.\n\n32\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.250\nNow if I never add a layer or do anything\nwith Layers, that's totally fine.\n\n33\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.720\nIt's actually layer one and\nit's sitting there waiting for\n\n34\n00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.970\nus to add more layers if we want,\nbut we don't have to.\n\n35\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.560\nNow I'm gonna jump to the other document\nand I'm gonna look,and show you what I use\n\n36\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.680\nlayers for and there's a lot of different\nreasons why you might want to use them.\n\n37\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.470\nThink of it anytime you wanna separate\nout something from something else for\n\n38\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.390\nwhatever reason.\n\n39\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.140\nMaybe you have an ad and you've got\nFrench and Spanish and English and\n\n40\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.450\nthey have a lot of common elements,\nlike the graphics are probably the same,\n\n41\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.650\nthe address for your store or\nwhatever will be the same.\n\n42\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.280\nBut the information is obviously\ngoing to be in different languages.\n\n43\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.080\nInstead of maintaining three\nseparate pages in a document or\n\n44\n00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.230\nthree separate documents entirely for each\nof those languages, you can have it all on\n\n45\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:15.640\none page in one document and\nhave each language be on it's own layer.\n\n46\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.950\nAnd you can on and off those layers\nindividually for things like printing or\n\n47\n00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.280\nproofing, or whatever we need to do.\n\n48\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.200\nIf we're ready to export them to a PDF,\nI can turn on the French layer and\n\n49\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.130\nexport a PDF.\n\n50\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.450\nAnd then I turn that layer off and\nturn on the Spanish layer and export that.\n\n51\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.330\nAnd again, everything that's common stays.\n\n52\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.110\nSo I'm gonna look over here\nat this sample that I have,\n\n53\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.230\nand you can see that I have many layers.\n\n54\n00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.580\nWe'll start creating from scratch, we'll\ncreate some new layers and name them.\n\n55\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.950\nBut right now, I just wanna show you\none of the uses that I use these for.\n\n56\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.970\nSo in this case, I have this brochure, and\n\n57\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.540\nI have three different things\nthat this travel company does.\n\n58\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.180\nThey do safari, they do travel,\nand they do weddings.\n\n59\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.610\nSo they do travel and photography.\n\n60\n00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.620\nSo I want to show you each of those.\n\n61\n00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.440\nI want the same layout.\n\n62\n00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.510\nI want it to look the same.\n\n63\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.050\nI've got the same logo, I've got the same\nbackground, I've got the same line setup,\n\n64\n00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.510\nand the same set of images, but\n\n65\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.080\nthe images are obviously going to change,\nas is the name here.\n\n66\n00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.090\nWhat I'm going to do is come over\nhere to my layers that I have and\n\n67\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.870\nI'm going to turn off the visibility\nicon for each of these.\n\n68\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.650\nI'm gonna come in here and\njust turn that off, except for the bottom.\n\n69\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.450\nThe base layer is what is common\nto everyone, as is this top one.\n\n70\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.900\nThis is called top items, and\n\n71\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.920\nit's just basically this line that\nI put over the top of the images.\n\n72\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.830\nSo it sits at the top.\n\n73\n00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.100\nI wanna talk about rearranging\nthe layers in just a minute.\n\n74\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.610\nBut right now, I just wanna show you\nthat I have this base layer, and\n\n75\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.190\nthis is common to all of them.\n\n76\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.020\nSo what I would probably do is not only\nhave this here and have it turned on,\n\n77\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.010\nI'm going to go into the second little\nbox that's in here and click and\n\n78\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.380\nlock that,\nbecause I don't want that stuff to move.\n\n79\n00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.080\nNow I can't accidentally grab it and\nmove it all around.\n\n80\n00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.940\nThen I say okay great, I want to lay out\nmy safari layer first, so let's do that.\n\n81\n00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.100\nI'm going to go ahead and\nclick on the visibility icon, and\n\n82\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.130\nhere's all the information.\n\n83\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.910\nI have safari and\nI've got these three images that are here.\n\n84\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.070\nI'm gonna turn that off and\nI'll turn on the travel one.\n\n85\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.610\nThere's the travel photos.\n\n86\n00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.200\nI am gonna click on the top two because\nI've got that line that just sorta\n\n87\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.560\nfinishes that off.\n\n88\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.470\nI can say, okay, great.\n\n89\n00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.590\nThat's the travel one.\n\n90\n00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.880\nI could now export this to PDF and\n\n91\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.640\nnow I know I have my travel\nphotos version laid out.\n\n92\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.070\nAgain, Safari, and then I can come in\nhere and choose the wedding one as well.\n\n93\n00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.260\nSo you can see that if I decide to\nchange the background color of this,\n\n94\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.390\nI can unlock it first and\nthen make a change to it.\n\n95\n00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.070\nAnd then I only have to\nchange it in one place.\n\n96\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.690\nI still know that I have\neverything else set.\n\n97\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.880\nI don't have to remember to change it in\nthree different documents when I just\n\n98\n00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.270\nsuddenly decide I hate that color and\nneed to change it to something else.\n\n99\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.830\nSo that's why I would use layers.\n\n100\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.220\nPlus I could show you how\nto create those layers.\n\n101\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.790\nGo back to my blank document.\n\n102\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.890\nSo like I said you have\none layer to start with.\n\n103\n00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.120\nYou have layer one, and it's visible.\n\n104\n00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.230\nNow layers are not specific\nto whatever page you're on.\n\n105\n00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.050\nSo you might have a page that\nuses five different layers, and\n\n106\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.140\npage two might only use one of those\nlayers or two of those layers.\n\n107\n00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.110\nFor instance, this book cover that I have,\nmaybe the cover has all these layers,\n\n108\n00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.710\nthe front cover and the back cover, and\nmaybe even the intro page has all these\n\n109\n00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.450\nlayers where I turn off, cuz each intro\nwould be specific to travel or safari.\n\n110\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.480\nBut maybe the interior\npages only use one layer.\n\n111\n00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.890\nAnd it's the one that's\ncommon to everything.\n\n112\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.770\nit's just basically about the company or\nwhere we go but\n\n113\n00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.310\nit's included in all versions.\n\n114\n00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.820\nMaybe it's just the cover that\nI'm creating that changes out.\n\n115\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.190\nSo again, keep in mind when you're\nworking with layers it's the board for\n\n116\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.540\nthe entire document, but\n\n117\n00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.500\nyou don't have to use every layer on\nevery page of that document, either.\n\n118\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.990\nAlright, so I'm going to go ahead and\nhave this layer, and\n\n119\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.400\nI want to create a new layer.\n\n120\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.960\nI can come down here to the new layer, I'm\ngoing to move this over a little bit so\n\n121\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.770\nwe can see that, and I can shrink this up\na little bit, we don't need that panel.\n\n122\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.610\nAnd I'm going to come down here and\nsay go ahead and create a new layer.\n\n123\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.750\nWhenever I use the new create new anything\nin these panels, hold down the Option or\n\n124\n00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.590\nthe Alt Key, because that actually\nforces up the dialogue box options for\n\n125\n00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.420\nyou, instead of having it create it and\njust call it, you know,\n\n126\n00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.850\nnew whatever number one, than having\nto double click on it to open it.\n\n127\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.090\nThe Option All forces that open.\n\n128\n00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.230\nSo we're gonna give it a name.\n\n129\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.480\nIn this case I'm just gonna\nleave it called Layer 2.\n\n130\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.290\nWe don't really know what layers we're\ncreating or why we're creating them.\n\n131\n00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.180\nSome people do things like they\nmight put the text all in one and\n\n132\n00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.460\nthe images all on another.\n\n133\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.480\nAnd as we'll see when we rearrange them,\n\n134\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.200\nit's easy to say, I really wanted all\nthe text sitting on top of all the images.\n\n135\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.000\nInstead of going into each text frame\nindividually and changing the stacking\n\n136\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.460\norder, by having them on a separate layer,\nI can move the entire layer up and\n\n137\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.380\nsuddenly, all the text is\non top of all the images.\n\n138\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.650\nSo again, thinking back to how\nthings are being output and\n\n139\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.590\nwhat's happening to this down the road.\n\n140\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.630\nAnd that's a theme you'll see throughout\nall of InDesign, from the very beginning,\n\n141\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.570\nwhen we started our document to now,\nwhat we're doing layers.\n\n142\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.830\nWe need to think,\nwhat's the purpose of it?\n\n143\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.130\nWhere's this going?\n\n144\n00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.830\nWhat happens to this file\nonce it leaves our hand?\n\n145\n00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.710\nOr when it goes to the next\npoint in our own work flow?\n\n146\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.070\nWhat happens to it, and\nwhat will make more sense?\n\n147\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.610\nSo that's something I'm always\nconstantly thinking about.\n\n148\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.210\nSo in this layer I can say great,\ngive this layer a name,\n\n149\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.800\njust call it layer 2 Two,\nI can choose a color for the layer.\n\n150\n00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.040\nNow I know that doesn’t sound very\nimportant, but what that’s going to do is\n\n151\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.370\nit's going to give the outline, the frame\nedges, when we see the frame edges and\n\n152\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.880\nwe’ve looked at it and up to this point,\nit's always been that light blue.\n\n153\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.270\nWell now I have different layers I want\nto be able to visually see the difference\n\n154\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.140\nbetween each of those layers.\n\n155\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.360\nIf you use the color that they choose,\n\n156\n00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.030\nthey generally alternate [INAUDIBLE]\nBetween light and dark, which is nice.\n\n157\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.360\nSo that as you start adding them, you can\nget a nice visual of which is on which\n\n158\n00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.840\nlayer, but feel free to change that color.\n\n159\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.900\nYou can also choose to\nshow the layer right away.\n\n160\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.760\nThat's that eyeball,\nthe little eyeball icon.\n\n161\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.210\nWe can also lock that layer right here.\n\n162\n00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.430\nIf I know this is the base layer,\nI might lock it when I first create it.\n\n163\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.720\nSo that I can't move anything,\non that layer.\n\n164\n00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.460\nAlso whether or\nnot the layer is a find to print, so\n\n165\n00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.570\nif you're allowed to print it, I can\nturn that off so that it doesn't print.\n\n166\n00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.610\nMaybe it's just a layer full of notes.\n\n167\n00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.400\nI often have a layer that's\njust called annotations and\n\n168\n00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.750\nit's generally just my notes to myself,\nor to my client and I can tell it\n\n169\n00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.140\nnot to print the individual items, but\nfor me, it's easier to have it here so\n\n170\n00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.460\nthat every time on the screen,\nI see it, but when I go to print it,\n\n171\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.550\nI know that it won't accidentally make\nit into the pdf or the final output.\n\n172\n00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.740\nI can also tell it to show the guides,\nor hide the guides, so\n\n173\n00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.290\nmaybe I have guides on this page, but\n\n174\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.730\nI can turn them off here and just not see\nthose guides, that's just a preference.\n\n175\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.100\nAnd lock guides so anytime I create\na guide on this particular layer it will\n\n176\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.330\nautomatically, they'll automatically\nbe locked and I can't move them.\n\n177\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.710\nJust again, options you may or\nmay not need.\n\n178\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.160\nSuppress text wrap when layer is hidden,\nthis is actually kind of nice because,\n\n179\n00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.450\nyou can set up test wrap, which we've\nlooked at in an earlier episode.\n\n180\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.180\nBut we can have text wrap that\nwraps around items here, or\n\n181\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.130\nwe can tell it to suppress\nthat if the layer isn't there.\n\n182\n00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.280\nSo, I leave that actually\noff because you can actually\n\n183\n00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.110\nhave text wrap wrapping around\nan item that's on a hidden layer.\n\n184\n00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.630\nSo maybe you just want text to\nwrap around in a star shape.\n\n185\n00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.730\nYou can create the star shape on a hidden\nlayer, and the text will wrap around it,\n\n186\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.980\neven though you can't see the star,\nit's on a hidden layer.\n\n187\n00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.620\nSo play with that,\nagain, that's an option.\n\n188\n00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.430\nSo now, I have my two layers, let's\nactually put a couple items on here, I'm\n\n189\n00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.980\njust gonna actually steal a couple from\nover here, turn on one of the layers here\n\n190\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.660\nand I'm just gonna grab this word safari\nand I'll grab the logo as well maybe.\n\n191\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.710\nI locked it so I can't steal it,\ngot to grab that,\n\n192\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.680\nunless I tried to click on it, didn't let\nme do that because I locked that layer.\n\n193\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.960\nSo you can see also that\nI have both those layers.\n\n194\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.300\nThere's a red layer and a blue layer,\n\n195\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.380\nthat's because they live\non two separate layers.\n\n196\n00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.390\nI'm gonna copy this and\nI'm gonna come back over here and\n\n197\n00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:40.730\nbefore I paste anything here, I wanna make\nsure a setting that I have is either on or\n\n198\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.870\noff, and\nthat is called Paste Remembers Layers.\n\n199\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.710\nIt's in the Layers panel menu.\n\n200\n00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.500\nSo it says Paste Remembers Layers and\nthat's on by default.\n\n201\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.800\nAnd that means that if I paste this and\n\n202\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.040\nI go to paste these items that\nI just stole from over here.\n\n203\n00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.230\nIt's gonna say, okay, you grabbed one\nfrom base layer and one from safari.\n\n204\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.710\nSo when I come over here it\ndoesn't have a base layer or\n\n205\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.620\nsafari layer so it's gonna create\na new one, and it's gonna put each\n\n206\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.750\none on the layer that it needs to be on,\nwhich is great if that's what you need.\n\n207\n00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.180\nSo you know if you bring something\nover you wanna setup all these layers.\n\n208\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.690\nIf you copy all the information and\n\n209\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.250\nyou say paste remembers\nlater you drop it in here.\n\n210\n00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.820\nNow, you have all those layers.\n\n211\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.410\nYou don't have to remake them or\nrename them.\n\n212\n00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.270\nIt's gonna come in, it's gonna be in the\nsame order, it's gonna be the same color.\n\n213\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.470\nActually, the color might change depending\nif you have layers there or not, but\n\n214\n00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.310\neverything will come in in\nexactly the way you need it to.\n\n215\n00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.940\nIn this case I wanna try turn that\noff because I want them all to end up\n\n216\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.440\non layer one.\n\n217\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.830\nSo we're going to do that,\nI'm going to hit paste.\n\n218\n00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.900\nI'm actually going to use Paste in Place,\n\n219\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.190\nwhich will put it in the same\nexact spot on the page.\n\n220\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.860\nI just grab the logo and the word.\n\n221\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.050\nI'm getting a little question mark here\nand that says you're missing that logo.\n\n222\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.740\nSo, I can actually double click on that.\n\n223\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.080\nIt'll ask me where does that logo live?\n\n224\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.170\nIt's why I've moved it, I just got\nto figure out where I move that to.\n\n225\n00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.420\nSo, I'll come out here, because I changed\nit, I changed the name of the logo.\n\n226\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.870\nSo, we're actually going to come\nout here and grab it in my logos.\n\n227\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.330\nIt's the travel logo and update that,\nnow I have that updated.\n\n228\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.010\nAs I brought that in it said, hey don't\nforget that you've lost this link.\n\n229\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.330\nSo I've got that item on layer one.\n\n230\n00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.080\nIt went both to layer one because I\nturned off Paste Remembers Layers.\n\n231\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.040\nAnd what I can see inside this layer is\nnot only everything that's in that layer,\n\n232\n00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.750\nbut I can drill down on that little\ndisclosure triangle that's there.\n\n233\n00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.480\nAnd I can see all the individual\nitems that are on that layer as well.\n\n234\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.380\nSo here it says safari.\n\n235\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.330\nThat's the actual words.\n\n236\n00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.610\nIf you got a text frame, it's gonna\nshow you the text that's in there.\n\n237\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.870\nIn this case, it shows me the name of the\nlogo that I've pasted in there as well.\n\n238\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.840\nAnd I can turn on and\noff each of those individually as well.\n\n239\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.730\nI also, let's say I have this here.\n\n240\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.300\nLet's put safari up here, just so\nit's overlapped so you can see.\n\n241\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.020\nI also can rearrange where\nthose items sit on the page.\n\n242\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.800\nSo instead of going into\nthe stacking order,\n\n243\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.700\nI can actually just move them\nif they're separate objects.\n\n244\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.470\nIn a layer, I can rearrange them there.\n\n245\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.410\nAnd when we're working with\nlayers whatever is at the top\n\n246\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:04.630\nis at the top of the order is actually at\nthe top of the stacking order for layers.\n\n247\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.830\nSo we've got a stacking order for\nindividual objects on a page.\n\n248\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:13.160\nWe also have stacking order for\nobjects for individual layers as well.\n\n249\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.270\nSo in this case the word safari is on top,\n\n250\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:20.070\nwell I can actually drag this item down\nbelow and now it sits behind that logo.\n\n251\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.610\nSo it’s the same thing as if I did the\nstacking order and moved it down as well.\n\n252\n00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.640\nSo this is an easier way to do that you\ncan actually see everything altogether you\n\n253\n00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.980\ndon’t have to drill down\nthrough the stacking order.\n\n254\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.780\nI can also rearrange the layers.\n\n255\n00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.940\nI have nothing on layer 2 so\nlet’s actually put something on there.\n\n256\n00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.030\nI ’m going to hide layer 1.\n\n257\n00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.790\nAnd whenever you're working on a layer,\n\n258\n00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.950\nyou need to make sure that the layer\nis selected in the layer panel.\n\n259\n00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.870\nOtherwise you're working\non a different layer and\n\n260\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.060\nyou think, I looked at layer two,\n\n261\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.260\nI thought that was the layer I was working\non, but it's actually on layer one.\n\n262\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.130\nWhatever's selected here is where\nyour objects are going to end up.\n\n263\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.750\nSo I'm just gonna create\nsomething super simple.\n\n264\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.290\nJust come in here and\nchange the color, and\n\n265\n00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.210\njust to that fill, and\nthat's on layer two.\n\n266\n00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.600\nWhen I turn layer one back on you can\nsee that it's in front of that, but\n\n267\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.710\nI can grab layer two, and\nmove that down below.\n\n268\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.770\nIt's like I move it back behind so I can\nrearrange how those layers actually sit.\n\n269\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.580\nOnce I have something selected on a layer,\nanything that I select, I'll get\n\n270\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.460\nthis little, let me actually move this so\nwe can see this, get this little proxy.\n\n271\n00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.750\nSo this little symbol, it just\nindicates that something is selected.\n\n272\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.390\nIt doesn't matter if it's one thing or\nten things, whatever I have selected\n\n273\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.120\nSelected it will automatically say hey,\nyou've got this item selected.\n\n274\n00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.360\nSo let's actually, I'm going to\ndrag across these two items here.\n\n275\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.510\nNow if I had this item selected,\nthe logo, and\n\n276\n00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.460\nthe colored square back behind it,\nI now have a proxy\n\n277\n00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.090\non both of those because I have an item\nfrom each of those layers selected.\n\n278\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.680\nWhat I want to do is grab this item.\n\n279\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.610\nLet's actually grab this item here,\njust the logo and\n\n280\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.070\nit says hey, you've got an item selected,\nwhat do you want to do with that?\n\n281\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.770\nWell the reason that's handy\nis that I could Copy and\n\n282\n00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.760\nPaste to a new layer if I wanted to.\n\n283\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.950\nThat's not really what I wanna do.\n\n284\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.520\nI wanna actually just\ndrag that little proxy.\n\n285\n00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.050\nSo if I want this item to go from Layer 1,\nI want the logo to go from Layer 1 where\n\n286\n00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:11.210\nit's sitting to layer two, I can just drag\nthat little proxy down to the other layer.\n\n287\n00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:15.110\nNow the layer has to be unlocked and\nit has to be visible for you to do that.\n\n288\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.460\nBut I can just drag it and\n\n289\n00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.420\nnow I did and now I can actually\nsee that it's out lined in the red.\n\n290\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.650\nThat means that it's on\nthat layer two logo or\n\n291\n00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:26.040\nlayer two layer, and\nit went ahead and moved it down.\n\n292\n00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.370\nNow, if I decided well actually,\nwhat I wanted is I wanted it to be on\n\n293\n00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:34.330\nboth layers, cuz that's what I've done\nover here, is I've got the logo, or\n\n294\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.940\nsorry, the different words\nappearing on each layer.\n\n295\n00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.540\nSo I say okay,\nI'm ready to move that to a new layer.\n\n296\n00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.920\nI can actually copy that\ninstead of move that.\n\n297\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.700\nI'm actually gonna show you on here,\n\n298\n00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.430\ncuz this is how I would do it if I was\nready to create a whole new layer.\n\n299\n00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.200\nWe've got another one.\n\n300\n00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.180\nMaybe it's going to be called, I don't\nknow, we'll call it Travel Tours, or\n\n301\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.930\nsomething like that.\n\n302\n00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.450\nI don't know,\nsomething interesting, Eco Tours.\n\n303\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.510\nLet's decide we're going to go into\nEco Tours as well with this thing, and\n\n304\n00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.040\nwe need a whole new layer for\nthe Eco Tours.\n\n305\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.470\nSo I would come over to\nsomething like this.\n\n306\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.320\nI'd probably hide the top items and\nprobably the base layer too so\n\n307\n00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.460\nI can kind of just see\nwhat's on the safari layer.\n\n308\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.960\nSo, now I know I need this text frame and\nthese three image\n\n309\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.120\nframes to go to my new layer that\nI'm gonna create called, ecotourism.\n\n310\n00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.460\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna copy all of those and\n\n311\n00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.650\nagain it shows me that\nI have this proxy here.\n\n312\n00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.290\nAnd I need to create a new layer,\nso I'm going to go ahead and\n\n313\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.370\nsay new layer and either come up here or\nuse the button at bottom say new layer,\n\n314\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:37.990\nand we'll call it Eco-Tourism and just\nleave the preset set here and say okay.\n\n315\n00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:42.820\nNow I have this safari stuff and\nI'm going to drag this Proxy, I'm\n\n316\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.000\ngonna hold down the Option key or the Alt\nkey, and that's going to copy that item.\n\n317\n00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.330\nAnd I'm actually gonna zoom in so\nwe can take a look at that.\n\n318\n00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.410\nOops, let's make sure\nwe're high enough here.\n\n319\n00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.970\nAnd, when I do that, I'm gonna hold\ndown the Option or the Alt key.\n\n320\n00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.810\nKey and drag it and\nI get a little plus when I do that.\n\n321\n00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:59.160\nSo I'm gonna drag it here and drop it.\n\n322\n00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.270\nSo now I have it in both places actually.\n\n323\n00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.440\nSo it's hard to see but it probably got\na little bit darker, cause I now have\n\n324\n00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.020\ntwo versions sitting right on top\nof each other, and that's fine,\n\n325\n00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.390\nbecause I'm gonna go ahead and\nhide safari, so I have that turned off.\n\n326\n00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.310\nNow I just have that ecotourism one.\n\n327\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:19.140\nI'm gonna come in here and make a change\nto that, of course, and say ecotours,\n\n328\n00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:19.680\nwe'll call it that.\n\n329\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.020\nAnd then of course I'm going to change\nout the images to something else.\n\n330\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.940\nSo I'd just come in here and\nmake the changes to the images.\n\n331\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.770\nI'm gonna leave them\nas they are right now.\n\n332\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.300\nI don't have any\necotourism images on here.\n\n333\n00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.780\nBut I have that set and now I can\nsay okay turn on that base layer and\n\n334\n00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.010\nturn on that top layer,\nwhich just puts that line across there.\n\n335\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.340\nAnd now I know that I have that ready,\nso it's super easy to duplicate.\n\n336\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.090\nNow, I could duplicate a whole layer if I\nwanted to, instead of dragging those items\n\n337\n00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:48.030\nindividually, I could just select on\nmy layer and say duplicate layer.\n\n338\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.310\nSo I can do that as well if I\nknow everything has to move.\n\n339\n00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.310\nI tend not to move things individually,\nbut\n\n340\n00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.460\nI just want to show you that\nyou are able to do that easily.\n\n341\n00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.910\nAnd again you can come down\nto each of these items and\n\n342\n00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.130\nI can see here's all the different images.\n\n343\n00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.880\nI can say, okay I realize this\none is sitting on top of that,\n\n344\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.610\nif they are overlapping it's a super easy\nto just drag the order of those images and\n\n345\n00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.130\nget again that stacking\norder easily through there.\n\n346\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.570\nAnd I think,\nI wanna make sure that's all for layers,\n\n347\n00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.130\nactually layers are pretty easy.\n\n348\n00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.430\nIt just for me it's thinking\nabout why you wanna use layers.\n\n349\n00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.990\nSometimes I'll get things that\nare completely layered up, and\n\n350\n00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.320\nI'm not really sure why.\n\n351\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.200\nBut for me, like I said,\nwhen I'm ready to print, I can say, okay,\n\n352\n00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.520\nI've got the ecotours ready to go.\n\n353\n00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.740\nI could export that now to a PDF,\nand I've got that ecotourism\n\n354\n00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.430\nready to go when it comes time to change\nthat, like I said the base layer.\n\n355\n00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.890\nCome over here, we'll grab this,\ngrab the color, just change the color,\n\n356\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.050\nI'm holding down the shift key\nto switch to a different color.\n\n357\n00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.120\nGonna say great, let's change it,\nwoo that's nice and bright.\n\n358\n00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.040\nWe change that but now that's changed for\nall four of those that we've made, and\n\n359\n00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.860\nI can print out or export out PDFs,\nsuper super easy to that.\n\n360\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.040\nSo layers are a huge way to manage\neverything that's on your page.\n\n361\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.530\nAnd individually on each of these as\nwell to be able to rearrange those\n\n362\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.540\nas well\n>> Erica,\n\n363\n00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.350\nwe appreciate you taking the time to\nexplain the ins and outs of layers.\n\n364\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.510\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n365\n00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.240\nBut before we do,\n\n366\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.390\ndo you have any additional words\nyou would like to say on layers?\n\n367\n00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.410\n>> No, I think I'm good.\n\n368\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.130\n>> Alright, very good.\n\n369\n00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.000\nWell thank you for joining us for this\ntopic and thank you for the viewer for\n\n370\n00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.600\nwatching and signing up for ITProTV.\n\n371\n00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.965\nI've been your host Wes

00:00:15.828\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:20.017\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our series in Adobe Creative Cloud\n\n5\n00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:20.608\n2015.\n\n6\n00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:23.863\nThat's right, we're coming back\nat you with more InDesign.\n\n7\n00:00:23.863 --> 00:00:26.072\nAnd joining me back in\nthe studios today is Erica Gamet.\n\n8\n00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:27.251\nErica, how are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:27.961\n>> Fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.505\n>> All right, great, so we've been\ncontinuing along the journey inside of\n\n11\n00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:33.232\nInDesign, where are we going next?\n\n12\n00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:36.045\n>> We're gonna start working\nwith pages and master pages.\n\n13\n00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:39.560\nNow I know we've been working in pages but\nonly one page really.\n\n14\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.558\nCouple times we've looked\nat multiple pages, but\n\n15\n00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:43.891\nnow we're gonna look how to\nnavigate through those pages.\n\n16\n00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:46.161\nAnd then we're going to\nlook at master pages, and\n\n17\n00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:49.900\nmaster pages are way of putting items on\na page that appear on multiple pages.\n\n18\n00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.373\nSo you don't have to copy and\npaste, and maintain, again,\n\n19\n00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:53.740\nmultiple pages of the same item.\n\n20\n00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.712\nIf it appears on the same page,\nwe put it on a master page and\n\n21\n00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:58.790\nthen it's just there magically for us.\n\n22\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.070\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\njump in and look at that.\n\n23\n00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.720\nSo the first thing I wanna do is, I'm\njust gonna start with a blank document.\n\n24\n00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.926\nJust a new document, Cmd or\nCtrl+N for that new document.\n\n25\n00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:10.224\nI've got my Pages panel open so\nwe can look at that, but\n\n26\n00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:11.890\nI have one page by default.\n\n27\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.210\nSo even if I never open the Pages panel,\nthere is one page in one section,\n\n28\n00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.300\nand we'll go into sections\nin just a little while.\n\n29\n00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.310\nBut I know that I have one page,\none section, and two master pages.\n\n30\n00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.500\nA master page of none,\nwhich sounds dumb, but\n\n31\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.758\nwe'll look at why we need\na master page of none.\n\n32\n00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:30.970\nAnd also an a master page, again,\nif we never go into the Pages panel,\n\n33\n00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.520\nit's there, it's happy,\nwe don't have to touch it, no big deal.\n\n34\n00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.440\nBut when we wanna add more than one page,\n\n35\n00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.653\nwe need to start working\nwith the Pages panel.\n\n36\n00:01:38.653 --> 00:01:42.480\nSo a couple of things first, we're gonna\ncustomize the panel to work for us.\n\n37\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.750\nSo we open up our Pages panel,\nif it's not already open you need to go to\n\n38\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.180\nthe Window menu and come down to Pages and\nopen it from there.\n\n39\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.494\nAnd then we can look at it and\nwe can say, okay, what do we wanna do,\n\n40\n00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:55.937\nhow do we want these pages\nlaid out in this panel?\n\n41\n00:01:55.937 --> 00:01:58.149\nSo I'm gonna go up to\nthe Pages panel menu, again,\n\n42\n00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.340\nit's this little menu on the upper right\nhand side, most of the panels have those.\n\n43\n00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.250\nAnd go down to the bottom and\nchoose Panel Options.\n\n44\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.098\nWhen I do that I get to choose what\nsize thumbnails I want each of\n\n45\n00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:10.282\nthese pages to be.\n\n46\n00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:14.554\nAnd I've got my Pages, or what I call\ndocument pages, just to kind of clarify\n\n47\n00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:18.920\nwhich pages we're talking about,\nand also Masters, or master pages.\n\n48\n00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.400\nWhat size do we want each\nof those icons to be?\n\n49\n00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.200\nBy default they set at medium,\nI tend to leave it at that.\n\n50\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.530\nAnd Show Thumbnails just means it's gonna\nshow us a little representation on there\n\n51\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.330\nof what is on that page.\n\n52\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.085\nAnd here's a little hint,\nif your machine is being slowed down,\n\n53\n00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:37.030\nthere's several things you can do to kind\nof, or not machine, but InDesign itself,\n\n54\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.460\nit just feels a little sluggish.\n\n55\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.470\nThere's a couple things you\ncan do to speed that up, and\n\n56\n00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.260\none of them is turn off those thumbnails.\n\n57\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.780\nBecause that thumbnail,\nevery time we add something on the page,\n\n58\n00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.690\nit has to redraw that thumbnail, and\nthat can kinda slow you down a little bit.\n\n59\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.550\nSo for the most part, I leave it on,\nbut if things are acting a little weird\n\n60\n00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.070\nI try turning that off, so\nthat's a good place to check.\n\n61\n00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.570\nAlso on the master pages, do you want\nto show the master pages vertically or\n\n62\n00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.200\nhorizontally?\n\n63\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.981\nMeaning instead of coming down\nin one long list over here,\n\n64\n00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:04.493\nthey'll actually go\nvertically across the panel.\n\n65\n00:03:04.493 --> 00:03:07.182\nNow that involves having to\nscroll through the panel,\n\n66\n00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:10.160\nI tend not to do that,\nI tend to leave it set exactly as it is.\n\n67\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.220\nBecause this is kind of how\nthe Pages panel has looked\n\n68\n00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.490\nthrough all the iterations of InDesign and\nall the software that we used before it.\n\n69\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.710\nSo it kinda set a precedence and that's\njust in my brain how Pages panels work.\n\n70\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.470\nAlso, again, thumbnails for\nthe masters as well.\n\n71\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.910\nYou can also have different icons that\nsit next to each of the page icons that\n\n72\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.920\nare here to tell you what's on that page.\n\n73\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.170\nFor instance,\nthere's one called Transparency.\n\n74\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.220\nI can select that, and when I do that,\n\n75\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.400\nif there's a transparent item, whether\nit's a clipping path, or a drop shadow,\n\n76\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.960\nor a photo that we brought in from\nPhotoshop that had transparency in it.\n\n77\n00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.416\nIt's gonna put that little checker box\nthat we're familiar with from Photoshop,\n\n78\n00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:46.900\nthat says it's transparent.\n\n79\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.920\nIt's gonna put a little box of\ntransparency, little old checkerboard next\n\n80\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.260\nto the page to tell us hey, there's\nsome transparent items on this page.\n\n81\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.540\nAnd when we get to output\nin a future episode,\n\n82\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.410\nwe'll see that knowing which page\nhas transparency is super important.\n\n83\n00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.990\nI keep talking about how\nit can cause issues, so\n\n84\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.930\nthat's a great way to turn that on so\nwe can see that and find that easily.\n\n85\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.340\nI can also allow myself\nto rotate the spread,\n\n86\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.840\nit just means that I can actually\nturn it sideways to work.\n\n87\n00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.863\nIt doesn't change anything\nin the printer output.\n\n88\n00:04:14.863 --> 00:04:17.497\nIt's just like if you had text,\nsay, running up the side,\n\n89\n00:04:17.497 --> 00:04:20.712\ninstead of having to work with your\nhead turned sideways the whole time,\n\n90\n00:04:20.712 --> 00:04:22.990\nyou can actually turn the spread rotation.\n\n91\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.210\nAnd actually work in the right rotation or\nin the right orientation\n\n92\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.190\nwhile you're typing, and\nthen it will flip it back for you.\n\n93\n00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.680\nI can also look at page\ntransitions if I'm working with\n\n94\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.020\ninteractivity which we're\nnot going to do in that.\n\n95\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.690\nBut it just tells you that you\ncan't have the icons displayed for\n\n96\n00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.980\nsmall or extra small sizes.\n\n97\n00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.830\nAnd do you want the pages on top,\nthe document pages on top or\n\n98\n00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.080\nthe masters on top?\n\n99\n00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.770\nAnd again, masters is how it's been,\nyou might not have any\n\n100\n00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.370\npreference if this is the first\ntime going to the Pages panel.\n\n101\n00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.250\nBut just know that if things are not\nlaying out the way you want,\n\n102\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.890\ngo in here to the Panel Options and\ncheck that out.\n\n103\n00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.420\nSo just a few options that are here,\nall right, so we have this one page.\n\n104\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.170\nWell I've been using the same\nkeyboard shortcut for\n\n105\n00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.498\na long time for adding a page.\n\n106\n00:05:02.498 --> 00:05:08.545\nThe quick way to add a page\nis the Shift+Cmd on Mac or\n\n107\n00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:12.620\nShift+Ctrl on a PC, and +P,\nthat automatically forces a new page.\n\n108\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.799\nNow I've been doing that indiscriminately\nas we go along putting it on here.\n\n109\n00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:19.744\nNow things to keep in mind when you use\nthat keyboard shortcut is it automatically\n\n110\n00:05:19.744 --> 00:05:22.421\nputs the next page directly\nafter the page you're on.\n\n111\n00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:25.370\nSo you can't really choose where it goes,\nyou'll have to rearrange it later.\n\n112\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.160\nAnd it also uses the same\nmaster that you had.\n\n113\n00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.110\nSo think about that when you're\nactually doing that in your workflow\n\n114\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.020\nif that's what you want, but\nthat's a quick way to add a page.\n\n115\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.970\nWell, that's how to add one page at\na time, well if we needed to add,\n\n116\n00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.150\nsay, seven pages to this document so\n\n117\n00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.655\nwe have an eight page document,\nwe'd have to do that seven times.\n\n118\n00:05:42.655 --> 00:05:46.115\nThat can be kind of a pain,\nespecially if you're adding 100 pages, so\n\n119\n00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:47.495\nthere's an easier way to do that.\n\n120\n00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:51.195\nUp under the Panel menu I can just\ncome in here and say Insert Pages.\n\n121\n00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:55.350\nAnd you also have more options available\nto you by using this command, so\n\n122\n00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.045\nI can say how many pages I wanna add.\n\n123\n00:05:57.045 --> 00:06:00.280\nLet's do seven, we're just gonna do\na simple eight page document here.\n\n124\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.800\nI can tell it where to go after\na certain page, before a certain page,\n\n125\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.780\nor the start or the end of the document.\n\n126\n00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.340\nSo let's do it after page one, and\nI can also choose a master, and\n\n127\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.820\nat this moment I only have\nthat A Master to choose from.\n\n128\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.970\nIn a few minutes we're\ngonna work on master pages.\n\n129\n00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.270\nBut I can choose from here which master\npage I want assigned to this page as well.\n\n130\n00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.380\nSo I'll say OK, and boom,\nnow I have eight pages that are there.\n\n131\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.160\nSo now I see them and\nall vertically stacked because,\n\n132\n00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.320\nby default, I had one master\npage which is one single page.\n\n133\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.193\nIt automatically,\nevery time it adds a page or\n\n134\n00:06:32.193 --> 00:06:34.169\na spread,\nwhich is actually what it's adding.\n\n135\n00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.120\nAnd a spread is how many pages are in\nthat particular group together.\n\n136\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.599\nSo in this case I have single\npage spreads, so as I add a page,\n\n137\n00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:45.210\neach one just gets added afterwards.\n\n138\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.660\nNow when I rearrange these pages,\nit'll be hard to see,\n\n139\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.800\nbecause we don't have\nanything on the pages.\n\n140\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.570\nBut if I grab page eight and move it up,\nand this is how I rearrange my pages.\n\n141\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.710\nGrab page eight, move it up, you can see\nthe little hand pulling it up above.\n\n142\n00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.727\nAnd I can drop it over here, and\nI'm gonna drop it after page two.\n\n143\n00:07:01.727 --> 00:07:04.305\nAnd you think it's gonna sit right\nnext to page two, but it's not,\n\n144\n00:07:04.305 --> 00:07:06.810\nit's actually gonna drop it in,\nand it actually becomes here.\n\n145\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.790\nI know it's hard to see with nothing\non there, but it's highlighted,\n\n146\n00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.420\nthat's the one I was touching.\n\n147\n00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.530\nIt moved in down below and\nit pushed everything down as well,\n\n148\n00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.970\nso everything's still\nin those single pages.\n\n149\n00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.000\nYou can turn that off, because that\nmight not be the behavior you want.\n\n150\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.090\nEven on an eight page document,\nlet's say we're doing eight pages and\n\n151\n00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.670\nwe know that page one\nis a right hand page.\n\n152\n00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.780\nPage two is a left hand page,\nand three, back and\n\n153\n00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.150\nforth, we're gonna paginate those.\n\n154\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.380\nI'm gonna keep them singly\nbecause when I export to PDF,\n\n155\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.480\nI'm gonna export single page PDFs.\n\n156\n00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.520\nAnd again, we'll talk about that when we\nget to PDF exporting in a future episode.\n\n157\n00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.140\nBut for\n\n158\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.160\nme, I wanna keep them singly because I\nwant them to be automatically numbered.\n\n159\n00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.100\nAnd I want the the person\nwho's outputting those,\n\n160\n00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.860\nwho may be at my print shop,\nto be able to paginate those or\n\n161\n00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.714\nput those pages together how they need to\nbe according to what their workflow is.\n\n162\n00:07:54.714 --> 00:07:58.418\nI don't wanna set it up and have them say,\nthat's not how we lay that out here, and\n\n163\n00:07:58.418 --> 00:08:00.315\nthen I have to pull my PDF apart and\nfix it.\n\n164\n00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:04.321\nAgain, going back to the original thing\nat the very beginning of the first,\n\n165\n00:08:04.321 --> 00:08:05.635\nfirst episode, I said,\n\n166\n00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:09.350\nmake sure you know what Happens to\nthis piece when it leaves your hand.\n\n167\n00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.834\nSo if it's going to a printer and you know\nits going to be paginated into a booklet\n\n168\n00:08:12.834 --> 00:08:16.700\nand saddle stitched and all that great\nstuff, talk to your printer beforehand.\n\n169\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.580\nMake sure you know who's printing it\nbefore you start cuz they're gonna give\n\n170\n00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.220\nyou parameters that their presses\ncan do or how they want it set up.\n\n171\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.660\nThey're gonna say, this is how I want it\nset up, so then we know ahead of time.\n\n172\n00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.655\nSo this case I'm gonna assume everything\nwe're doing a single page pdf and from\n\n173\n00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:34.920\nthere you have to extrapolate what you\nwould need for your particular project.\n\n174\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.342\nBut maybe we wanna see\ntwo pages side by side.\n\n175\n00:08:37.342 --> 00:08:40.516\nMaybe, for instance, if we are doing this\nA page, and we're gonna do one, two,\n\n176\n00:08:40.516 --> 00:08:43.794\nthree, and four, I know that page four and\nfive is gonna be the centerfold, right?\n\n177\n00:08:43.794 --> 00:08:46.987\nThat's the thing I'm gonna see right\nin the middle of the two pages butted\n\n178\n00:08:46.987 --> 00:08:47.978\nup next to each other.\n\n179\n00:08:47.978 --> 00:08:52.502\nSo I might want page four and five to sit\nnext to each other on my screen in what's\n\n180\n00:08:52.502 --> 00:08:55.328\ncalled the two page spread,\njust so I can see it.\n\n181\n00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:58.618\nEven though when I print the PDF\nit's still gonna be separate, but\n\n182\n00:08:58.618 --> 00:09:01.150\nI wanna see them side\nby side on my screen.\n\n183\n00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.140\nWell I can do that, but I have to turn\noff one of the default settings, but\n\n184\n00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.020\nif I go up under the Panel menu and\nI come down and I have these options,\n\n185\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.270\nAllow Document Pages to Shuffle or\nAllow Selected Spread to Shuffle,\n\n186\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.120\nbecause I actually have a page\nselected that's why that came up.\n\n187\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.370\nBut allow document pages to shuffle is on,\n\n188\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.080\nmeaning if I move that page\neight up like I did and\n\n189\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.430\nit moves up, it shuffled everything\nback down so it's stays exactly as is.\n\n190\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.820\nI can turn that off and\n\n191\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.130\nsay don't do that as I move a page\nnext to it it actually stays.\n\n192\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.960\nSo now I have this little bracket there,\nit's not just a line after the sign its\n\n193\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.872\na bracket, when I move that up those\ntwo items are now next to each other.\n\n194\n00:09:36.872 --> 00:09:38.530\nI'm gonna undo that actually and\n\n195\n00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.060\nI'm even going to turn this setting\nback to the way it was when I started.\n\n196\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.910\nWhat I want to do instead is I want to\nselect two specific pages because for\n\n197\n00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.410\nthe most part I'd like that shuffling to\nstay on, so I don't want to turn that off.\n\n198\n00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.820\nBut I do want to turn it off for\none set of pages, just that page four and\n\n199\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.770\nfive that I want to see\nnext to each other.\n\n200\n00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.160\nSo the page four and\n\n201\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.590\npage five, I'm holding down the shift\nkey to select both of those.\n\n202\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.620\nGo up to that pages panel menu and\nI'm gonna say allow selected spreads to\n\n203\n00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.190\nshuffle, I'm gonna select that which means\nit's going to remove that checkbox, right?\n\n204\n00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.210\nAnd now I have these\nbrackets next to each other.\n\n205\n00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.800\nSo you can see that those\ntwo are selected and\n\n206\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.650\nthey're ready to be able to\nwork together and not shuffle.\n\n207\n00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.791\nSo I'm just gonna grab this one page\nfive and move it just to the right.\n\n208\n00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:23.390\nSo now I have page four and\nfive as a spread.\n\n209\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.460\nNow to get to that spread I'm actually\nstill sitting on page two here.\n\n210\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.200\nI will double click on one of those\npages and that spread shows up.\n\n211\n00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.880\nNow I've been using a keyboard shortcut\nalong the way to fit my page in the window\n\n212\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.280\nand that is command or\ncontrol 0 to fit that in the window.\n\n213\n00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.270\nWell that fits that one\npage on the window.\n\n214\n00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.800\nSo I have this nice page for\n\n215\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.300\nfit in the window but I can't\nactually see the rest of that spread.\n\n216\n00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.380\nSo I'm actually gonna move\nthis up a little bit.\n\n217\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.740\nLet's shorten this box here and I want to\nhave the entire spread show in the window.\n\n218\n00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.878\nSo I want to do another keyboard shortcut\nwhich is Command or Control, Option or\n\n219\n00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:56.880\nAlt and that zero.\n\n220\n00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.160\nIf you can't remember that, go up to the\nview menu and say fit spread in window.\n\n221\n00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.350\nWhen I do that now that entire spread,\nthat two page spread, fits in the window\n\n222\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.120\nso that's just an easier way to\nview those pages and see them.\n\n223\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.240\nI'm actually gonna take\nboth of those items, and\n\n224\n00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.780\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nreselect that Allow them to Shuffle, so\n\n225\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.540\nit actually will break it back cuz,\nI actually want those single pages.\n\n226\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.510\nJust so it's really easy to see\nthe pages that we have here.\n\n227\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.840\nSo, to navigate through the pages,\nI have a lot of different options.\n\n228\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.750\nI can either double-click on a page,\nand again,\n\n229\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.160\nyou can't really see much\nbecause all the pages are blank.\n\n230\n00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.570\nBut, if you look down in the lower\nleft hand corner, down here,\n\n231\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.930\nyou can see that it shows me what\npage I'm actually sitting on.\n\n232\n00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.768\nAnd I'm actually gonna pull this\nup slightly, just so it's not so\n\n233\n00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:43.310\nfar down at the bottom of my screen so\nwe can actually see it.\n\n234\n00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.780\nAnd, I'm gonna double click on each,\nand as I do,\n\n235\n00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.040\nyou can watch that down in the lower left,\nand see what page I'm changing to.\n\n236\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.690\nThe other way I can navigate is using\nthese buttons that are down here.\n\n237\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.850\nI can jump all the way to the beginning,\nI can go to the previous spread,\n\n238\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.890\nthe next spread, or\nthe end of the document, or\n\n239\n00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.790\nI can come in here and just choose\nthis pull down menu and I can see\n\n240\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.800\nall the pages that I have on my document,\nincluding any master pages that I have.\n\n241\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.680\nSo that's one other way to\nnavigate around the pages.\n\n242\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.740\nAnd the last way is the way I've been\ndoing with a keyboard short cut, CMD or\n\n243\n00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.790\nCTRL J.\n\n244\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.700\nSo I think of that as jump, right?\n\n245\n00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.943\nSo CMD or CTRL J and it says,\nwhat page do you wanna go to?\n\n246\n00:12:21.943 --> 00:12:26.000\nLet's jump to page two.\n\n247\n00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.700\nAnd just a little note is that we have two\n\n248\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.830\ndifferent types of page numbering,\nabsolute numbering and section numbering.\n\n249\n00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.740\nSo I wanna keep track, right now we only\nhave absolute numbering as turned on by\n\n250\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:44.320\ndefault and that means page three is page\nthree in the document as I looked at it.\n\n251\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.920\nWhen we get into automatic\nnumbering in just a few minutes.\n\n252\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.011\nIt's going to, I might have something\nthat's called Page 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 and\n\n253\n00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:56.790\nthen 2-1 which is actually\nthe fourth page in the document,\n\n254\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.130\nso absolute page number\nwould give you page 4.\n\n255\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.810\nIf you've set up that numbering, that\nsection numbering like that, or some kind\n\n256\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:08.500\nof, you set up numbering, let's say we\nstart the page numbering at three instead.\n\n257\n00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.424\nAnd that's something that we can do when\nwe start that new document one of our\n\n258\n00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:16.654\noptions was start with a different page\nnumber, so if I start with page three, and\n\n259\n00:13:16.654 --> 00:13:19.870\ncome here, now I have whoops,\nthat's a whole new document.\n\n260\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.770\nLet's actually add a few pages to that.\n\n261\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.070\nSo now I have three, four, five, and six.\n\n262\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.960\nSo if I go to jump to the third\npage in the document, or\n\n263\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.632\nlet's say the first page in the document,\njump to page one.\n\n264\n00:13:30.632 --> 00:13:34.490\nIt's gonna tell me there is no page one,\nbecause I told it to start with page\n\n265\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:40.970\nthree, but what I wanted to tell it was\njump to the absolute page number one.\n\n266\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.230\nSo it gives you this little example here,\nit even tells you that, so\n\n267\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.960\nit says okay,\nI need to put a plus in front of that.\n\n268\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.330\nSo I'm looking for page one but it says\nhey there's no page one, you've got three,\n\n269\n00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.300\nfour, five, and six.\n\n270\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:56.180\nI said well I want to jump to the first\npage in the document, so I use a + one,\n\n271\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.040\nand that looks up to the first\npage in that particular document.\n\n272\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.910\nSo, just keep that in mind if\nyou start doing numbering,\n\n273\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.480\nit started on a different number or\nwhen we get into section numbering and\n\n274\n00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.690\nwe do this starting over\nagain at each new section,\n\n275\n00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.580\nit automatically expects you to have\nthe absolute number that's there.\n\n276\n00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.480\nIf I go into my preferences,\ncommand or control J and I start here.\n\n277\n00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.740\nI can do page numbering\nin the general pane.\n\n278\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.630\nSection numbering is on by default.\n\n279\n00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.140\nI'm sorry, absolute numbering\nis usually on by default.\n\n280\n00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.600\nSo absolute numbering says,\nyeah, page one is page one.\n\n281\n00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.610\nSo I can change that so now on that\nother one, even though I started with\n\n282\n00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.360\npage three, let's do that same thing,\nwe'll start with this page three.\n\n283\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.042\nOops, only one page but\nwe want to start with page number three.\n\n284\n00:14:40.042 --> 00:14:41.941\nWhen I come in here this is number one,\nI said hey,\n\n285\n00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:43.450\nwhy didn't you start with page three.\n\n286\n00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.050\nWell I've told it absolute numbering.\n\n287\n00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.390\nThat is the first page in that document.\n\n288\n00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.690\nWhere it will make sense is if I\ngive it an automatic page number,\n\n289\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.590\nit says, she really wants to\ncall that page three, all right?\n\n290\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.805\nSo again, when we get into\nsections in just a minute.\n\n291\n00:14:56.805 --> 00:14:59.541\nAnd make a little more sense but\nI just want you to know that sometimes\n\n292\n00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:02.949\nthe numbering is gonna seem a little off\ntoo and that's the difference that's there\n\n293\n00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:06.580\nor when I go to jump to something it says,\nhey, that page number doesn't exist.\n\n294\n00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.730\nThrow a plus in front of it.\n\n295\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.900\nAll right, so\nthat's kind of how we navigate around.\n\n296\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.190\nWe can add pages, subtract pages,\nI can also move pages elsewhere.\n\n297\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.570\nI can select a page and say let's move\npages, and I can move it somewhere else.\n\n298\n00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.710\nI can say move that page\nto the end of the document.\n\n299\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.809\nI can also move it to\nan entirely new document.\n\n300\n00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:28.332\nSo if I have another document open,\nlet's actually open another one.\n\n301\n00:15:28.332 --> 00:15:32.275\nI'll just open up another untitled one,\nUntitled 9 is our other one.\n\n302\n00:15:32.275 --> 00:15:35.820\nCame back to this original one that we\nhave our eight pages on and say move\n\n303\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.160\npages, and I can say, okay I would\nlike you to move it to untitled 9 and\n\n304\n00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.170\nI would like to have you move\nit obviously after page 1.\n\n305\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.460\nThere's only one page and\nonly has one choice, before or\n\n306\n00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.970\nafter that page which is the same as\nthe start and the end of the document but\n\n307\n00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.070\nI can move that to page 3 and\nI can even delete it from here if I want.\n\n308\n00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.740\nSo it'll pull it out of this document and\nplace it in the new and\n\n309\n00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.310\nget rid of it in the old one if I want.\n\n310\n00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.320\nThat's off by default,\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n311\n00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.450\nWhen I say OK now I've got an extra page\nover there, that page just moved over.\n\n312\n00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.685\nAnd if I have section numbering and\n\n313\n00:16:04.685 --> 00:16:08.549\nmaster page items applied to it\nall of that would go as well.\n\n314\n00:16:08.549 --> 00:16:10.682\nSo that's kind of pages,\nhow we add them, how we move around.\n\n315\n00:16:10.682 --> 00:16:13.768\nThere's a lot of other ones,\nthere's keyboard shortcuts for page up and\n\n316\n00:16:13.768 --> 00:16:14.279\npage down.\n\n317\n00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:15.897\nThere's some built in It's in shortcuts.\n\n318\n00:16:15.897 --> 00:16:19.197\nI don't have the ten key pad ,so I\ncan't even use the page up and down.\n\n319\n00:16:19.197 --> 00:16:21.840\nBut that might be a key that\nyou have on your keyboard.\n\n320\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.350\nAgain, there's so\nmany ways to navigate around.\n\n321\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.730\nFind which one works fastest for you.\n\n322\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.520\nMaybe you know exactly what page it's on.\n\n323\n00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.230\nMaybe you're looking at\nthe page thumbnails and\n\n324\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.670\nthat's how you're going to\nfigure out which one you need.\n\n325\n00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.240\nAnd you're going to double\nclick on that page.\n\n326\n00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.665\nBut again, you want to make\nsure that you're on the page.\n\n327\n00:16:34.665 --> 00:16:37.707\nDouble-click on the page to actually\nbe on the page you want to work on.\n\n328\n00:16:37.707 --> 00:16:40.030\nBecause you can't start working on\nit until you've double-clicked and\n\n329\n00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.180\nactually navigated to that page.\n\n330\n00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.550\nSo, those are pages or document pages.\n\n331\n00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.880\nNow, we're gonna get into master pages.\n\n332\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.670\nSo, master pages are items that live on\na page that you want to appear elsewhere.\n\n333\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.460\nAnd so, I'm actually going to show\nyou a sample of one and then,\n\n334\n00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.085\nwe're start with one that's\njust really really simple.\n\n335\n00:16:56.085 --> 00:16:58.210\nWithout all the extraneous\ninformation that's here, so\n\n336\n00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.230\nI'm going to jump out to\nthis particular book.\n\n337\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.220\nAnd I'm going to look at the master\npages and how I have those set up.\n\n338\n00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.590\nSo, these are my regular pages.\n\n339\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:07.280\nI've got the cover.\n\n340\n00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.540\nIt doesn't have a master applied to it.\n\n341\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.870\nI've got a blank page and then, I've\ngot a page here and if I look at this,\n\n342\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.400\nI can see that C master is\napplied to this particular page.\n\n343\n00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.940\nAnd B master is applied to this page\nthat's here and D and B and so on.\n\n344\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.790\nSo, each of those master\npages has a little thumbnail.\n\n345\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.990\nto tell me which master page\nis applied to that particular\n\n346\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.370\ndocument page that's there.\n\n347\n00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.890\nNow, I'm going to go in and\nlook at the master pages and\n\n348\n00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.720\nsee what each of those are made of.\n\n349\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.290\nAnd then, we're going to set\none up really, really quickly.\n\n350\n00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.220\nJust a simple one.\n\n351\n00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.420\nSo, I have this one called king and\nI'll explain what king means in a minute.\n\n352\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.320\nSo, I have one that is white page and\nit's got a page number.\n\n353\n00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.410\nI've got one left page\nwith the page number.\n\n354\n00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.920\nBasically, I'm giving them descriptions of\nwhat it is that's on each of those pages.\n\n355\n00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.050\nThis one says this is a grid right hand\npage and a grid left hand page and\n\n356\n00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.560\na quote.\n\n357\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.232\nI've got one with a pull-out quote and\nwhether it's a right-page or\n\n358\n00:17:58.232 --> 00:18:01.580\nleft-page, you notice the page\nnumber is moving back and forth.\n\n359\n00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.420\nSo what I can do is,\nI can come down here and say, okay,\n\n360\n00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.690\nI've got this grid that's here.\n\n361\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.290\nAnd I can come in here and I can change\nit or maybe on this one is a blank one.\n\n362\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.440\nI didn't assign a master page to it and\nI'm ready to go, and\n\n363\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.270\nI want to show you what\nthis master page is.\n\n364\n00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.710\nSo, I can go okay,\nlet's say it's a quote page.\n\n365\n00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.920\nPage two is going to be a quote page and\nit's page two, so it's a left-hand page.\n\n366\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.501\nSo I'm going to grab the quote left,\n\n367\n00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:26.020\ngoing to drag the master page\nright on top of the document page.\n\n368\n00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.220\nAnd now everything that's\nthere is assigned to it.\n\n369\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.760\nWhat you'll notice is, that I can't click\non any of the items I just put on there.\n\n370\n00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.160\nThat's because they belong\nto the master page.\n\n371\n00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.510\nThat's the whole point of\nputting on a master page, so\n\n372\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.200\nthey're always on the same\nplace when I need them.\n\n373\n00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.380\nSo what I'm going to do is, I'm going\nto say, okay, maybe I like this but\n\n374\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.180\nI really don't want this grid down here.\n\n375\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.970\nOr maybe I don't want the top image,\nright?\n\n376\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.540\nI just wanted to say title and\nthe quote and two pictures at the bottom.\n\n377\n00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.310\nI want to get rid of this\none line that's here.\n\n378\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.480\nWhat I can do is called an override, so\n\n379\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.760\nI can get to those master page items\non this particular document page.\n\n380\n00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.330\nBut I can't just accidentally move it,\nI have to take an extra step.\n\n381\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.810\nSo I'm going to do command/control\nshift and click on that item and\n\n382\n00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.900\nwhen I do that, now I can actually\ngrab that frame that's there.\n\n383\n00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.210\nSo, I'm going to delete that and\nlet go of that.\n\n384\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.430\nSo I can actually, even if I didn't\ndelete it, lets say I don't delete, but\n\n385\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.960\nI have it there.\n\n386\n00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.140\nSo if I do a select all, the only\nthing I can select is that one item.\n\n387\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.970\nEverything else is still\nattached to that master page.\n\n388\n00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.380\nThis frame still has\nan attachment to the master page.\n\n389\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.200\nIt's just that I overwrote it.\n\n390\n00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.210\nSo, I can do things like delete it or\nI can move it or something like that, but\n\n391\n00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.850\nit's still has that same connection to it.\n\n392\n00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.380\nBut I can come over here to the panel,\npages, panel, menu,\n\n393\n00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.320\nand go to the master pages sub-menu.\n\n394\n00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.170\nAnd I can say things like,\ndetach from the master.\n\n395\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.710\nIf I do that, I've totally severed\nany connection to the master, and\n\n396\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.750\nI tend not to do that.\n\n397\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.050\nBecause I may have just overridden\nthis to delete it and that's fine.\n\n398\n00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.920\nI deleted it and it's gone, or maybe\nI just wanted to make a change to it.\n\n399\n00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.230\nMaybe I decided I just\ndon't like where it sits.\n\n400\n00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.940\nMaybe on this page, I decided that\nthis needs to move up a whole lot, so\n\n401\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.400\nwe're just going to move it up here.\n\n402\n00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.910\nI want it to suddenly maybe sit\nbehind the title that's back there.\n\n403\n00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.340\nThe page that's back there and\nI just want to move that, but\n\n404\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.320\nI don't want to totally\nsever its connection.\n\n405\n00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.610\nSo, I can go back to the master\nthat I've created here and\n\n406\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.290\nthis is all the items that are on this\nmaster, and I can select this item.\n\n407\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.630\nLike I save, actually now,\nwhat I would like is,\n\n408\n00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.020\nI would like to change the stroke\nof this on the master page.\n\n409\n00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.658\nAnd I'm going to make it bigger.\n\n410\n00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:30.500\nI'm going to go to Strokes Panel, I would\njust make it bigger and then maybe,\n\n411\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.810\nwe're actually going to\nfill it with a color.\n\n412\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.320\nFor whatever reason,\nwe're going to do that.\n\n413\n00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.160\nJust so that,\nthat's something easy to see and, whoops.\n\n414\n00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.720\nWe're going to actually change\nthe fill and not the stroke.\n\n415\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.250\nLet's change the fill here to something\ndark and blue and we'll say, okay.\n\n416\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.100\nAnd then, I'm going to go back to that\npage that I assigned that master.\n\n417\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.940\nAnd you'll notice, that the color and\nthe stroke all got changed.\n\n418\n00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.230\nEven though I moved that\nmaster page item away.\n\n419\n00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.450\nSo what I did when I did that override,\nwhen I Shift+Cmd+Clicked on that.\n\n420\n00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.270\nI overwrote it and\n\n421\n00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:03.030\nsaid okay, I want to do some stuff to\nthis item that's on the master page.\n\n422\n00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:07.050\nI want to change the fill color and I want\nto change the stroke thickness of it.\n\n423\n00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.880\nEverything else is still\nattached where it sits.\n\n424\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.910\nAnything else that is\ndictated by that master page\n\n425\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.970\nis still going to come through\nto this item on that page.\n\n426\n00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:21.930\nExcept the stroke color and stroke width\nand the fill color, so anything I change.\n\n427\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.780\nSo anything I overrode,\nremains whatever I did here, but\n\n428\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.530\neverything else is still common and\nis still coming through.\n\n429\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.450\nSo, hopefully that makes sense.\n\n430\n00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.080\nYou can move around where things sit but\nyou say hey, maybe just on this page,\n\n431\n00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.740\nI need to move it.\n\n432\n00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.860\nOr maybe in this case,\nwe just didn't want it all together and\n\n433\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.730\nwe delete and that's fine.\n\n434\n00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.720\nI can always bring that back.\n\n435\n00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.750\nI can come in here and I can reapply\nthat master page, so I'll go ahead and\n\n436\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.340\nreapply that master page.\n\n437\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:50.320\nCome here and apply this master\npage back to that page two.\n\n438\n00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.720\nSo I can say, apply that to page 2,\nand it comes back and\n\n439\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.390\nit's back there exactly as it was.\n\n440\n00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.300\nSo I come in here, it's applied and\n\n441\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:03.980\nagain, now I can't select that item,\nbecause it's connected to the master page.\n\n442\n00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.588\nSo, let's start from the beginning here,\nhow I normally do this.\n\n443\n00:22:06.588 --> 00:22:09.620\nI'm going to go back to that\neight page section that we have.\n\n444\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.743\nPull this up slightly.\n\n445\n00:22:10.743 --> 00:22:13.820\nI'm going to create a couple of\nthings on this master page and\n\n446\n00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.182\nI'm going to show you something\ncalled cascading master pages.\n\n447\n00:22:17.182 --> 00:22:19.670\nAnd that just means that\nwhat I put on one page,\n\n448\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.145\nif I duplicate or\nbase a master on that master.\n\n449\n00:22:22.145 --> 00:22:25.600\nEverything that's on the original map\nmaster rr what's called the parent,\n\n450\n00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.140\nfilters down into all the child\npages that I create from it.\n\n451\n00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.280\nNow why is that important?\n\n452\n00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.580\nWell, I might have page numbers\nthroughout my document.\n\n453\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.410\nMaybe I'm making a book.\n\n454\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.640\nI've got page numbers.\n\n455\n00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.740\nI'm going to have section headers on each.\n\n456\n00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.010\nMaybe I want sections along the top and\n\n457\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.480\nI also want the name of my book across\nthe top that's going to be on every page.\n\n458\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.600\nNow, it might move where it sits and on\npages, we might have a righthand page and\n\n459\n00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.990\na left-hand page.\n\n460\n00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.680\nAnd so for me, I'm going to put\neverything that I think is going to be\n\n461\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.540\ncommon throughout my document.\n\n462\n00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.240\nI'm going to put that on Master Page A.\n\n463\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.180\nI have that one called\nKing in my other sample.\n\n464\n00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.780\nThe King is like he's in charge.\n\n465\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.290\nSometimes I just call it a Master and\nleave it at that.\n\n466\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.830\nI can change the name if I want to.\n\n467\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.730\nHowever, but right now I'm just\ngoing to leave it as a Master.\n\n468\n00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.635\nAnd I'm going to say everything that I\nthink is going to end up in the book will\n\n469\n00:23:10.635 --> 00:23:12.500\nend up on Master Page A.\n\n470\n00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.950\nAnd I base other Masters on that and I\ncan base Masters that are based on those.\n\n471\n00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.720\nwe can keep coming down\nthe the family tree and base that.\n\n472\n00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.250\nBut the cool thing is, if I say,\nI hate the way the page numbers look.\n\n473\n00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.800\nI want to change the font.\n\n474\n00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.920\nI change it on the master Page A and\n\n475\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.840\nit changes on all of the child pages and\nall of the ones that are based on it.\n\n476\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.890\nAnd then,\n\n477\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.200\nall of the document pages that have\nthat master applied to it also change.\n\n478\n00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.620\nChange it in one place and it ripples\nthroughout the entire document, so\n\n479\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.700\nlet's do that really quickly.\n\n480\n00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.140\nI'm just going to show\nyou what I would do.\n\n481\n00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.040\nThis is not going to be\nthe best designed book.\n\n482\n00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.860\nWe're just going to come in here,\nand we're going to center it.\n\n483\n00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.440\nWe're going to call it My Great Book.\n\n484\n00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.520\nThat's what I'm going to call it.\n\n485\n00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.630\nOops, Great Book here, and\nmake that a little bit bigger.\n\n486\n00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.330\nSo again, I'm just going to\nwork with a couple things here.\n\n487\n00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.872\nI'm going to make that bold and\nI'm going to do something.\n\n488\n00:23:56.872 --> 00:23:59.550\nI'm going to set section\nup really quick as well.\n\n489\n00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.829\nI'm just going to type section,\nor that might be the chapter or\n\n490\n00:24:01.829 --> 00:24:03.160\nsomething like that.\n\n491\n00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.120\nAnd again, I'm going to make it.\n\n492\n00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.888\nI'm going to design it how I want it and\nsome of this stuff,\n\n493\n00:24:06.888 --> 00:24:08.931\nwe're going to automate in just a minute.\n\n494\n00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:13.068\nBut I like to have something in there, so\nI know what my text is going to look like.\n\n495\n00:24:13.068 --> 00:24:15.397\nI'm also going to do page numbers and\nin this case, I'm going to put them up.\n\n496\n00:24:15.397 --> 00:24:17.539\nHigh so that we can see them up here.\n\n497\n00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:20.824\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and just put in,\nfor me when I do page numbers,\n\n498\n00:24:20.824 --> 00:24:24.619\nI put in the biggest, like fattest number\nI can think of cuz I wanna make sure that\n\n499\n00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:28.980\nmy text frame is big enough to accommodate\nthat text without getting overset text.\n\n500\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.230\nSo in this case I'm gonna do a keyboard\nshort cut for right justified text.\n\n501\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.240\nI may copy this item, so I'm just going\nto option or Alt Click on that, and\n\n502\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.556\nhold down the Shift key so\nit moves straight across the page.\n\n503\n00:24:40.556 --> 00:24:44.650\nAnd I'm gonna left justify that,\nCmd or Ctrl+Shift+L to justify that.\n\n504\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.350\nI'm gonna look at that and\nsay, okay, great.\n\n505\n00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.700\nThis is where my chapter's gonna go,\nso the title.\n\n506\n00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.530\nThese are the page numbers, and then\nmaybe I have some text in there as well.\n\n507\n00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.340\nI can set up a text frame if I want for\neasy flowing.\n\n508\n00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.200\nOr, if I\"m bringing a text\nfrom somewhere else.\n\n509\n00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.010\nI don't need to setup\nthe text frame ahead of time,\n\n510\n00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.260\nI can do that auto flow where\nit automatically flows for me.\n\n511\n00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.960\nSo I'll set that up and then I realize\nall the pages now look like that, but\n\n512\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.470\nI never apply master page\nA to my document pages.\n\n513\n00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.080\nIt's sort of the repository\nwhere everything sits.\n\n514\n00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.870\nI'm gonna base other masters on it.\n\n515\n00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.850\nSo let's go back to master page A.\n\n516\n00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.880\nGonna double click on that master page.\n\n517\n00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.834\nAnd I'm gonna create a new master page,\nright?\n\n518\n00:25:19.834 --> 00:25:24.920\nSo I'm gonna say New Master, and\nI'm gonna give it a name and a prefix.\n\n519\n00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.650\nAnd that prefix appears on document pages,\nso keep it short.\n\n520\n00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.780\nYou can have probably three or\nfour letters, up to three or\n\n521\n00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.450\nfour letters on it, and it's fine.\n\n522\n00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.290\nMaybe you need to have some kind of\ninternal code that makes sense to you.\n\n523\n00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:36.690\nI'm just gonna leave it at B.\n\n524\n00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.120\nI'm gonna call this one right,\nand then I usually say odd.\n\n525\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.840\nThat way I remember my odd pages on the\nright and my even pages are on the left.\n\n526\n00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.010\nAnd I'm gonna base it on Master Page A.\n\n527\n00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.770\nNumber of pages, that's how many pages\nare in the master spread itself.\n\n528\n00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.395\nWe're working with single pages, you can\nwork with double pages and that way you\n\n529\n00:25:53.395 --> 00:25:56.768\ncan pull down a whole set of double pages\non top of your double page spreads.\n\n530\n00:25:56.768 --> 00:25:58.690\nBut for clarity's sake we're\ngonna keep everything single.\n\n531\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.610\nAnd I could choose what\nsize it needs to be.\n\n532\n00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:05.500\nSo, I'm gonna say okay and when we come in\nhere it says great, that's write page on.\n\n533\n00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.960\nI'm gonna do the same thing,\ncreate a new one.\n\n534\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.970\nSay new master and\n\n535\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.470\nwe'll call this, we'll leave\nthe prefix there, we'll call it left.\n\n536\n00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.240\nLet's get it so\nit's named the same left and even and\n\n537\n00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.740\nit's also one page and\nit was based on master page A also.\n\n538\n00:26:22.752 --> 00:26:26.480\nAll right, so now everything looks exactly\nthe same, what I wanna do before I\n\n539\n00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.110\ngo any further is assign this\nmaster page to the document pages.\n\n540\n00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.660\nI have a couple of different ways,\nlike I said you can drag it and\n\n541\n00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.560\ndrop it on top of a document page, or\nI can double click on one of the pages.\n\n542\n00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.780\nCome up here and say apply master\nto pages and choose those.\n\n543\n00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.930\nNow what would be great, still not here,\nsomeday it will be here, I'll click and\n\n544\n00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:49.550\nI'll be so happy it'll say assign that\npage to all odd pages or all even pages.\n\n545\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.860\nIt knows the difference,\nit's still not available.\n\n546\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.517\nSo the right odd page,\nhow do I assign that to the pages I need?\n\n547\n00:26:54.517 --> 00:26:56.570\nI have to type them all in,\nbut I can do 1, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n548\n00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:00.720\nSo I'll say OK,\nnow I have B assigned to that.\n\n549\n00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.062\nThey look exactly the same,\nI know we haven't changed anything yet but\n\n550\n00:27:04.062 --> 00:27:05.070\nwe have those ready.\n\n551\n00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.370\nI'm gonna do the same thing for\nthe left even one,\n\n552\n00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:12.390\nI'm gonna say apply that\nmaster to pages 2, 4, 6 and 8.\n\n553\n00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.580\nSo now I have a B and a C and\na B and a C and a B and a C.\n\n554\n00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.170\nSo we can see the pattern starting here.\n\n555\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.140\nBut what I need to do is make changes\nto those particular master pages.\n\n556\n00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.190\nWell, on this master page there\nare certain things that I do not need.\n\n557\n00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.550\nI do not need a left\nhand page on my right, or\n\n558\n00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.430\nleft hand page number\non my right hand page.\n\n559\n00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.250\nSo I'm going to delete that,\nwell when I try and\n\n560\n00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:37.680\nclick on it, it belongs to master\npage A so I can't just delete it.\n\n561\n00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.530\nSo, I'm gonna do the command or\ncontrol shift and click and delete it so,\n\n562\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.920\nnow I have a right hand page.\n\n563\n00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.560\nSame thing on here,\nI'm gonna delete the right hand one so\n\n564\n00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.480\nI just have a left hand page.\n\n565\n00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.250\nEverything still following along, I hope\nso cuz it gets a little tricky, I know but\n\n566\n00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.840\nwhen you see it work, you're gonna say,\nI think well, that saved me a lot of time.\n\n567\n00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.750\nI think we're no longer need to explain\nit then, it does to actually do it.\n\n568\n00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.890\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\n\n569\n00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.940\nI'm gonna go ahead and make sure that I\nhave automatic page numbering turned on.\n\n570\n00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.670\nSo right now, it's page 888 on every page,\nthat's not doing us any good.\n\n571\n00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.720\nI've got my right page,\nmy left page, right page, left page.\n\n572\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.438\nBut I need to have automatic\nnumbering turned on.\n\n573\n00:28:12.438 --> 00:28:14.740\nLet me go back to master page A.\n\n574\n00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.480\nAgain, I only need to do it in one place.\n\n575\n00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.881\nThink if I had 20 master pages, I've got\na right hand first page of a chapter and\n\n576\n00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:23.018\na right hand where there's a picture,\n\n577\n00:28:23.018 --> 00:28:26.607\nright hand when there's a colored\nbar at the bottom or whatever.\n\n578\n00:28:26.607 --> 00:28:30.864\nThere's all these different right hand\npages that could be eventually all based\n\n579\n00:28:30.864 --> 00:28:32.310\nback on this master page A.\n\n580\n00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.060\nCome in here and I change it once.\n\n581\n00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:39.700\nSo, I'm in the master page A, I'm gonna go\nhead and select the text that's in here.\n\n582\n00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.980\nI wanna tell it automatic text numbering.\n\n583\n00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.950\nSo, I go under type,\n\n584\n00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:48.810\nI'm gonna come down to Insert Special\nCharacter > Markers > Current Page Number.\n\n585\n00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.680\nNow that's a long thing to remember,\nbut that's where it lives.\n\n586\n00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.610\nAnd it says, it's A.\n\n587\n00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.270\nAnd if I come over here to\nthe right hand page, it now says B.\n\n588\n00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:01.037\nAnd if I go to any of the B masters\nthat are down here, I I have page 1,\n\n589\n00:29:01.037 --> 00:29:02.270\n3 and 5 and 7.\n\n590\n00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.860\nThey're all numbered for me automatically.\n\n591\n00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.320\nWe have to go back and\ndo the left-hand page as well.\n\n592\n00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.212\nSame thing, select that,\n\n593\n00:29:08.212 --> 00:29:13.823\nType > Insert Special Character > Markers\n> Current page number, all right?\n\n594\n00:29:13.823 --> 00:29:18.110\nSo now we have right hand page, left hand\npage, right hand page, a left hand page.\n\n595\n00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.920\nAll right, so we can go ahead and do that.\n\n596\n00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.655\nAll right, let's come back to\nthe master page that's here and\n\n597\n00:29:24.655 --> 00:29:25.645\nI need to change this.\n\n598\n00:29:25.645 --> 00:29:27.610\nI want this to say chapter, right?\n\n599\n00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.290\nSo right now it's just a section.\n\n600\n00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:33.020\nWell I have to tell it where\neach new section begins.\n\n601\n00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.020\nSo for me, I'm gonna look at this and I\ncan see I have this little black triangle.\n\n602\n00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.280\nThat means that's section one so by\ndefault you had one page and one section,\n\n603\n00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.130\nand everything's there but I haven't told\nit where a new section starts yet at all.\n\n604\n00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:48.785\nSo this is where I can start naming and\nrestarting my numbering over if I want to.\n\n605\n00:29:48.785 --> 00:29:51.888\nI don't have to and\nI can also give each section a name so\n\n606\n00:29:51.888 --> 00:29:56.360\nthat this automatically will say chapter\none, chapter two, chapter three.\n\n607\n00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.870\nAnd as I add pages in chapter 1 and\ncontinually add them to the end of chapter\n\n608\n00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:05.570\n1, it continually names them chapter 1\nuntil it rolls into that second section.\n\n609\n00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:09.030\nSo to do that, I need to tell it this\nis a section and what a name of it is.\n\n610\n00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:12.510\nSo I double click on that first page\nof that first section which is page 1.\n\n611\n00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:18.551\nCome up under here and I'm gonna say come\ndown to numbering and section options.\n\n612\n00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:20.759\nAnd I'm going to tell it\nstart the section there,\n\n613\n00:30:20.759 --> 00:30:24.177\nit's on by default because it's the first\npage, but I can say automatic page\n\n614\n00:30:24.177 --> 00:30:27.755\nnumbering which means it will continually\nnumber the page numbering for you, or\n\n615\n00:30:27.755 --> 00:30:30.600\nI can say start the page\nnumbering at a specific number.\n\n616\n00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.908\nThis is something if I want each\nchapter to start the numbering over,\n\n617\n00:30:33.908 --> 00:30:36.883\nI might say start numbering at page one,\npage one, page one.\n\n618\n00:30:36.883 --> 00:30:39.811\nI can give that page number a prefix,\nso maybe I want this to be called,\n\n619\n00:30:39.811 --> 00:30:42.855\nlet's call this intro cause it's\nactually not going to be chapter one.\n\n620\n00:30:42.855 --> 00:30:44.870\nI'm gonna have intro,\nchapter one, and chapter two.\n\n621\n00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.610\nAnd I can choose what style I want for\nthe page numbers themselves and\n\n622\n00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:52.550\nbecause it's an intro,\nI'm gonna use lowercase Roman characters.\n\n623\n00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.610\nAnd then section marker,\nI'm gonna give this a name,\n\n624\n00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.150\nthis is actually what I'm going to have\nshow up in this section tag that I have.\n\n625\n00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.590\nSo here's where I'm going to actually\nwrite out what it needs to say.\n\n626\n00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.000\nIntroduction, oops.\n\n627\n00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.150\nWe do not need that capital N,\nso I'm gonna say introduction.\n\n628\n00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.600\nAnd I can also choose to include\nthe prefix, which is this intro.\n\n629\n00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.320\nWe're numbering pages so\nmaybe I want it to say intro colon and\n\n630\n00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.226\nwhen I do that now it's gonna\nsay intro colon lowercase i.\n\n631\n00:31:18.226 --> 00:31:22.960\nAnd then lowercase ii,\nif I want that to show up.\n\n632\n00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.750\nIf I don't want that to show up in\nmy numbering I don't need to have\n\n633\n00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.280\nthat turned on.\n\n634\n00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.550\nBut I'm gonna turn on just so\nwe can see that and\n\n635\n00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:29.950\nbecause I gave it an introduction.\n\n636\n00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.276\nThat's where it's a section right now.\n\n637\n00:31:32.276 --> 00:31:35.200\nIt's gonna save the name of that chapter.\n\n638\n00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.970\nSo I'm gonna say okay and so\nnow it didn't change anything and\n\n639\n00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:43.120\nthat's because back on master page A I\nstill have the word section in there.\n\n640\n00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.950\nI need to tell it, this is the section.\n\n641\n00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.190\nSo it grabs that information that\nwe just put in that section and\n\n642\n00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:49.740\nnumber in dialog box.\n\n643\n00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.780\nSo in this case, I need to again\ntell it how to automate that.\n\n644\n00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.640\nI'm gonna use type I'm gonna come down\nto Insert Special Character > Markers.\n\n645\n00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.420\nAnd I'm gonna tell it to\nuse the Section Marker.\n\n646\n00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.490\nWhen I do that, it still says Section,\nbecause that's how it labels it.\n\n647\n00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.460\nBut I can come down to each thing.\n\n648\n00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.245\nNothing looks different\non the Master Pages.\n\n649\n00:32:08.245 --> 00:32:12.747\nWhen I double-click on the right side,\nit says Introduction and it says Intro:1,\n\n650\n00:32:12.747 --> 00:32:15.200\nIntro:2, Intro:3, all the way across.\n\n651\n00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.022\nUntil I put in a new section.\n\n652\n00:32:17.022 --> 00:32:21.880\nSo let's do that, I'm just gonna just say\npage three is where chapter one starts.\n\n653\n00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.881\nDo the same thing, do that really quickly\nbecause it's the same thing we just did.\n\n654\n00:32:25.881 --> 00:32:29.731\nI can start my numbering at page one if I\nwant give it a prefix I'm gonna call it\n\n655\n00:32:29.731 --> 00:32:32.720\na one colon and I wanna include\nthat in the page numbering.\n\n656\n00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.480\nI want to show up on the page\nI want regular Roman numerals,\n\n657\n00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.120\nI'm sorry Arabic numerals and then section\nmarker I wanna call this chapter one.\n\n658\n00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.940\nSo now I'm gonna say OK,\npage three have chapter one and\n\n659\n00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.000\nstarts over with the numbering 1.1,\n1.2 1.3 etc.\n\n660\n00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.250\nSo, because I have this chapters if I\njust have to add a page here we'll use\n\n661\n00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.700\nthat keyboard shortcut really\nquick to add a page number.\n\n662\n00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.190\nIf I add two more pages,\n\n663\n00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.630\nboom boom, it continues to number\nwith that the introduction.\n\n664\n00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.950\nNow you notice this is a right\nhand page I do have to go back and\n\n665\n00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.470\nsay assign that right hand master to it.\n\n666\n00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.710\nBut now i have the master\npages ready to go.\n\n667\n00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:12.320\nYou can see how on they cascade down,\neverything works beautifully that way.\n\n668\n00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.900\nOne more thing I wanna show really quick\nis something that was introduced a couple\n\n669\n00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.240\nof versions ago called Primary Text Frame.\n\n670\n00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.190\nI just wanna show you\nquickly how that works.\n\n671\n00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.630\nIt's basically when we\nstarted a new document,\n\n672\n00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:25.560\none of our options was do we\nwant a Primary Text Frame.\n\n673\n00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.163\nIf you forget to add it here you\ncan add it later and that's okay.\n\n674\n00:33:28.163 --> 00:33:32.062\nBasically what it is, there's one primary\ntext frame allowed per master page and\n\n675\n00:33:32.062 --> 00:33:35.620\nthat just basically says this is sort of\nthe guy in charge and I always want to\n\n676\n00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.430\ntext to flow in to him no matter what\nsize or where he's laid out on the page.\n\n677\n00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.140\nAnd so\nthere's regular text frame items and\n\n678\n00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.230\nyou can have as many of those as you\nwant but you can only have one primary.\n\n679\n00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.630\nSo I'm just gonna show you on\nthe master page what I have.\n\n680\n00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.470\nThis one has a primary\ntext frame applied to it.\n\n681\n00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.210\nSo I have this frame here and\nI have this little icon and it says,\n\n682\n00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:54.210\nthis is a primary text frame.\n\n683\n00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.790\nIf I jump to one that doesn't have a\nprimary and I select it, I can see that it\n\n684\n00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.880\nlooks different, it doesn't have\nthat arrow and if you roll over it,\n\n685\n00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.510\nit does tell you that, and you can click\nto toggle between the two of them.\n\n686\n00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.400\nSo basically, this one has a primary\ntext frame and it's this big square.\n\n687\n00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.910\nAnd I have this other two that\nhave this smaller text frames,\n\n688\n00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:11.490\nthis are set as primary text frames.\n\n689\n00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:14.520\nNow, I said you can only have one,\nyou could have one story.\n\n690\n00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.020\nSo, it's two frames but\n\n691\n00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.210\nthat story is the primary text\nframe story and this has nothing.\n\n692\n00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.250\nSo, what is that look like?\n\n693\n00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.640\nWhen I come to this first one,\n\n694\n00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.300\nit is a primary text frame,\nif I fill that with place holder text and\n\n695\n00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.800\nthen I say okay I would really, really\nlike to switch to this other layout.\n\n696\n00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.460\nAnd you notice it's even a different\nlayout, it's a wide layout.\n\n697\n00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.136\nI can actually change the size of a page,\neither by using the page tool,\n\n698\n00:34:38.136 --> 00:34:42.117\nwhich I didn't cover, or I can come over\nhere and just change it to a new size,\n\n699\n00:34:42.117 --> 00:34:43.180\na custom size here.\n\n700\n00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.570\nSo we can have different page\nsizes inside the same document.\n\n701\n00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:51.050\nBut anyway, I have this master setup\nwith this primary text frame and\n\n702\n00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.110\nI have these that are set here.\n\n703\n00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.940\nAnd I think, I want the text\nto flow into those two frames.\n\n704\n00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.470\nSo I drag this master on top of this page,\nand\n\n705\n00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:01.470\nit says, do you wanna go ahead and\nuse the master page size?\n\n706\n00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.610\nYes, I want it to switch to a new size.\n\n707\n00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.110\nBut my text didn't come with it.\n\n708\n00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.720\nNothing, whoops, actually let me back up.\n\n709\n00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.730\nI accidentally put the text\nin the master page.\n\n710\n00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.010\nI wanted to put it on the document page.\n\n711\n00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.620\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nfill that with placeholder text.\n\n712\n00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.640\nAnd when I assign this and\nsay change it to this, I think great,\n\n713\n00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.180\nit's gonna sit in those two frames.\n\n714\n00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.448\nBut it didn't, that's because those\nare not master, or primary, text frames.\n\n715\n00:35:24.448 --> 00:35:27.754\nSo what I can do, I'm gonna grab this one\nthat does have a primary text frame set-up\n\n716\n00:35:27.754 --> 00:35:30.082\nand drag it, it's gonna ask me\ndo I wanna change the size?\n\n717\n00:35:30.082 --> 00:35:35.880\nYes, I do that and now let text frame\nfloat into those primary text frames.\n\n718\n00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.669\nAnd also, you notice what it did,\n\n719\n00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:41.013\nit added new pages because I have\nsmart text free flow turned on.\n\n720\n00:35:41.013 --> 00:35:43.890\nSo as I did that,\nit continually added those.\n\n721\n00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.690\nAnd if I change that again\nto something else and say,\n\n722\n00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.960\nactually let's put this back and do that.\n\n723\n00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.550\nIt automatically will change,\nand it will reflow as necessary.\n\n724\n00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.830\nIt's gonna take a minute,\nit's gonna jump backwards.\n\n725\n00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.227\nActually it'll fit, if it didn't and\nif I had delete unused pages turned on,\n\n726\n00:35:57.227 --> 00:35:59.903\nit would then delete those\nempty pages as well.\n\n727\n00:35:59.903 --> 00:36:02.790\nActually, they are not empty anymore\ncuz they have master page items on.\n\n728\n00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.300\nBut the primary text frame is a way\nto change the master page and\n\n729\n00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.670\nget the text to keep moving so\nyou don't have to keep rearranging and\n\n730\n00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:14.080\ndoing overrides on those master or on the\ndocument pages of the master page Items.\n\n731\n00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.950\nAnd that's Master Pages\nkind of in a nutshell.\n\n732\n00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:19.500\nIt's just a great way\nto make sure that you\n\n733\n00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.980\ndon't do the same work over and\nover again.\n\n734\n00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.930\nIt takes a little bit of\nthinking ahead of time.\n\n735\n00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.520\nBut it really saves you time and\nconsistency down the road.\n\n736\n00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.710\nErica, I appreciate you and we appreciate\nyou and I know the viewers out\n\n737\n00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.860\nthere appreciate you taking the time\nto show us Pages and Master Pages.\n\n738\n00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.840\nDoes look like we're coming to end\nof another episode but before we do,\n\n739\n00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.100\ndo you have any additional words you'd\nlike to throw into this episode?\n\n740\n00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.485\n>> No,\nI think we've covered everything on that.\n\n741\n00:36:39.485 --> 00:36:41.970\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, very good, and thank you for\n\n742\n00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.319\njoining us in the

host,\n\n3\n00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:15.800\nWes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.630\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.380\nwe're coming back at you with more\nabout Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n6\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.480\nMore specifically,\nwe're diving back into InDesign, and\n\n7\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.590\njoining me back in the studios\ntoday is Erica Gamet.\n\n8\n00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.480\nErica, how you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.450\n>> Fantastic, thanks.\n\n10\n00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.030\n>> Great.\nSo we've\n\n11\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.020\nbeen going through this\njourney in InDesign.\n\n12\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.290\nWhat's the next destination?\n\n13\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.750\n>> We're gonna stop at the library.\n\n14\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.691\n>> All right, very good!\n\n15\n00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:36.276\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe're gonna talk about libraries.\n\n16\n00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:39.280\nAnd there are now actually two\nflavors of libraries in InDesign, so\n\n17\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.860\nwe're going to talk about them separately.\n\n18\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.330\nSo for clarity's sake we're going to call\nthem InDesign Libraries and CC Libraries,\n\n19\n00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.940\nor Creative Cloud libraries.\n\n20\n00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.180\nWe're going to start first with\nthe InDesign Libraries, and\n\n21\n00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.300\nI may just call them libraries, because\nthat's how they're tagged in the menus.\n\n22\n00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.450\nSo I'm going to jump in and\n\n23\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.270\nwe are going to look at what a library is,\nwhy we want to use it.\n\n24\n00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.860\nAnd the reason there are two, is because\nthere have been libraries in InDesign for\n\n25\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.670\na very, very long time.\n\n26\n00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.490\nI don't even remember how long, but\nthey've been there for a long time.\n\n27\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.380\nAnd with the advent of the Creative Cloud\nand being able to sync all your\n\n28\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.450\nassets together they've\nintroduced libraries there.\n\n29\n00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.430\nSo, there's just sort of this separation.\n\n30\n00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.790\nAt some point I think they will merge and\nbecome only one, but for\n\n31\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.690\nnow we've got both.\n\n32\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.480\nSo, a library is just a place,\n\n33\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.000\na repository to keep items that\nyou use over and over again.\n\n34\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.150\nSo again, we're gonna start\nwith the InDesign library, so\n\n35\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.140\nthat's their native just to InDesign they\nwork within the InDesign environment only.\n\n36\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.660\nAnd then we'll branch out to the CC\nlibraries, but both of them work in\n\n37\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.810\nthe same way as that you put something in\nthere, so that you can easily access it.\n\n38\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.920\nSo we're always trying to find things that\nwe use over and over again, like logos,\n\n39\n00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.840\nand things like that.\n\n40\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.460\nSo a library file,\nan InDesign library file,\n\n41\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.250\nis a standalone file, and\nit's not document specific.\n\n42\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.700\nSo I can have a library open that\nI just have open all the time, and\n\n43\n00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.100\nI can pull the elements from that library\ninto whatever document I'm working on.\n\n44\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.750\nSo for me,\nI might have one that is all of my logos.\n\n45\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.630\nSo why would I need a lot\nof different logos.\n\n46\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.919\nWell I might have one that\nhas a graphic with it,\n\n47\n00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:09.696\none that's just maybe my type logo,\nI've got one that's in black and white,\n\n48\n00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.846\nI've got one that's in RGB for\nall my web and digital output, and\n\n49\n00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:15.600\none that's in CMYK for\nany printing that I need to do.\n\n50\n00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.100\nSo I'm going to have different\nversions of that logo, and\n\n51\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.470\nI want to know that they're always sitting\nthere where I can access them easily.\n\n52\n00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.800\nAnd I would put those in a library file.\n\n53\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.020\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna open up an existing library and\n\n54\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.800\nshow you how to grab\nitems from that library.\n\n55\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.300\nThen we'll put some items into a library\nand save that library as something new.\n\n56\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.900\nSo to get to a library,\n\n57\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.050\nwe just go to the File menu just as\nif we were opening an InDesign file.\n\n58\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.560\nIf we did file open, we might open\nup an InDesign file, an Indd file,\n\n59\n00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.260\nor we can come into whoever is\nsitting in our computer and\n\n60\n00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.030\nI can see that I have something called an\nIndl file, that is InDesign library file.\n\n61\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.980\nAnd if we click on this,\nyou might see that it says, CS4.\n\n62\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.800\nThat's what it was created.\n\n63\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.470\nSo the libraries themselves don't get\nupdated so if you were to just click\n\n64\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.400\non this library item out on the desktop or\non the explorer, it's going to\n\n65\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.080\nlaunch whatever version or try to launch\nwhatever version it was created in.\n\n66\n00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.770\nIn fact, if I double click on this\nwill launch CS4, which is really old.\n\n67\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.010\nAnd my computer might explode, who knows.\n\n68\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.910\nSo for me, I always wanna go from within\nthe application, from within InDesign, and\n\n69\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.380\nsay file open, and open that library.\n\n70\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.570\nSo I'm gonna open up this one, and\nthis is just called wild items.\n\n71\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.270\nThis just means that these\nare items that I would use for\n\n72\n00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.740\nthis wild photography company\nthat I'm working on stuff here.\n\n73\n00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.010\nSo, in this library, and it's hard to see,\nthe thumbnails are not all that great.\n\n74\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.110\nI can actually make them bigger,\nunless they are as big as they can.\n\n75\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.020\nUp under the library panel menu,\nI can come in here and\n\n76\n00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.820\nI can say, large thumbnail, but\nit doesn't help a whole lot.\n\n77\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.140\nMade my logos a little bit bigger and\neasier to see.\n\n78\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.950\nBut all this text is still greeked\nout meaning that it's just grey.\n\n79\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.550\nI can't really see what it says,\nbut I can roll over it and\n\n80\n00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.570\nI do have a little bit of a description.\n\n81\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.090\nSo what I'm gonna do is just scroll\nthrough and see what I have inside here.\n\n82\n00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.980\nI can see that I have my color logo and\na black and white logo and\n\n83\n00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.240\nI can double-click on each and\nsee what keywords I've put in there.\n\n84\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.220\nSo if I double click,\n\n85\n00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.520\nI can see that it has a name to it, that's\nthe name of the file that I put in there.\n\n86\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.120\nAnd it's an image that\nautomatically tags that for me.\n\n87\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.820\nI never change that.\n\n88\n00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.890\nThere's no reason to, I just\nwhatever it deems it as, I leave as.\n\n89\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.700\nAnd then I put a description here.\n\n90\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.290\nThese are just sets of key words.\n\n91\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.040\nThis is helpful if you have lots and\nlots of logos.\n\n92\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.590\nSo if I had lots of levels here,\nI might put just black, I might put CMYK,\n\n93\n00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.500\nI might put that it's Pantone color,\nI might put that it's RGB.\n\n94\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.510\nJust something so that when I'm looking\nfor all my logos, maybe I have one that's\n\n95\n00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.100\nthe graphic, one that's the text, and\nI've got three different types of logos.\n\n96\n00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.470\nAnd then I've got each of those in\nblack and white, in CMYK, and RGB,\n\n97\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.760\nI might wanna Just look for my RGB Images.\n\n98\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.570\nSo I can tag those, but we're going\nto put things in a library in just\n\n99\n00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.190\na second I just wanted to kind of get you\nfamiliar with what a library looks like.\n\n100\n00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.480\nNow this library is just sort of,\nthink of it like a bookshelf.\n\n101\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.930\nJust where I put my logos on the shelf and\nI grab them from.\n\n102\n00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.510\nThere's no two way communication\n\n103\n00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.070\nwith libraries with in design\nlibraries back to the libraries.\n\n104\n00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.010\nSo for instance, if I put something from\nthis library into my InDesign document and\n\n105\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.570\nmake changes to it in\nthe InDesign document.\n\n106\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.790\nIt doesn't notify the library\nthat changes have been made.\n\n107\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.500\nSo that's one of the limitations to\nthe InDesign libraries that are there.\n\n108\n00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.640\nBut like I said, it's just a place\nwhere we keep it on the shelf so\n\n109\n00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.400\nit's there when we need it.\n\n110\n00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.320\nWe can pull it down and\nput it into our document, but\n\n111\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.780\nit doesn't ever tell the shelf\nhave made changes to this item.\n\n112\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.000\nSo how do we get things under the page?\n\n113\n00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.410\nWell, when I open up a library,\n\n114\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.630\nand again this library is there as long\nit's open even if I create a new document.\n\n115\n00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.150\nI'm just gonna do command Ctrl+N\nto create a new document.\n\n116\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.700\nWhen I open that up,\nthat library is still there.\n\n117\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.200\nIt wasn't specific to\nthat particular document.\n\n118\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.240\nSo, again, it's not document specific.\n\n119\n00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.020\nSo I can have that open.\n\n120\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.000\nIf I know I'm working on a bunch of stuff\nfor wild, I'll open up my wild library and\n\n121\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.820\nleave it there just all day long.\n\n122\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.800\nAll right, so let's grab something.\n\n123\n00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.490\nI think, okay,\nwe're going to go digital with this.\n\n124\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.640\nSo my nice color version of my AI file,\n\n125\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.810\nmy illustrator file is\nthe logo that I want to use.\n\n126\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.210\nSo, I have a couple of different options,\nI can either use the panel menu and\n\n127\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.210\nplace that item, or\nI can just simply drag that onto the page.\n\n128\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.540\nAnd when I do, I drag and drop it.\n\n129\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.356\nAnd it puts it to the size it\nwas when I put in the library.\n\n130\n00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:34.690\nNow one thing you might notice,\nis that it's just a big gray square.\n\n131\n00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.180\nWell what happened is that when I put\nthat in the library the logo was in\n\n132\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.600\na specific place.\n\n133\n00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.380\nSo a specific directory on hard drive.\n\n134\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.080\nThat's where it expects to find it.\n\n135\n00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.510\nIn a previous episode we talked about\nlinks, and making sure our links were\n\n136\n00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.420\nalways updated, and make sure that\nwe don't have something missing.\n\n137\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.660\nI'm gonna look in my links panel, and\n\n138\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.510\nI can see that this particular\nitem is actually missing.\n\n139\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.290\nI've got big question mark right there.\n\n140\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.110\nSo it says, okay, it's missing.\n\n141\n00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.180\nSo when I put it into that library,\nit was sitting in a specific spot.\n\n142\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.680\nSince then,\nI have moved where that sits, and\n\n143\n00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.010\nnow what I've done is\nplaced a broken link.\n\n144\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.010\nSo, I need to actually fix the link.\n\n145\n00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.420\nSo again, it moved, but nobody told\nthe library that it's been moved.\n\n146\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.280\nI have to actually update that.\n\n147\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.940\nSo I'll go into my Links Panel.\n\n148\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.590\nAnd I'm just going to relink,\nand then we'll go out and\n\n149\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.880\nfind where that's sitting.\n\n150\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.140\nThat is the photo logo two.\n\n151\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.070\nWe'll actually update it with this one,\nit's not two, but it's one,\n\n152\n00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.810\nwe'll update it with that.\n\n153\n00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.600\nAnd I have that.\n\n154\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.100\nNow I can actually tell it this item\nneeds to be updated, because otherwise\n\n155\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.080\nif I keep placing this logo everywhere,\nand I have obviously renamed it.\n\n156\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.460\nI took the two off there or\nI moved it or whatever happened to it.\n\n157\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.166\nEach time I place it in a new document,\nI'm gonna keep getting that same error.\n\n158\n00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:52.252\nSo if I know that,\nthe one that I just relinked it to,\n\n159\n00:07:52.252 --> 00:07:57.246\nit's where it's going to be sitting, then\nmay be I should go ahead and update that.\n\n160\n00:07:57.246 --> 00:07:59.538\nSo that I don't have to keep doing this.\n\n161\n00:07:59.538 --> 00:08:03.473\nSo I'm gonna select the The item on\nthe page, and the item in the library,\n\n162\n00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:04.881\nthey're both selected.\n\n163\n00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:07.908\nAnd I'm going to go up to the panel menu,\nand I'm going to go ahead and\n\n164\n00:08:07.908 --> 00:08:09.850\nupdate that library item.\n\n165\n00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.080\nSo, now when I do that, the next time I\nplace this anywhere whether it's in this\n\n166\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.500\ndocument, or in a new document,\nwhen I drag it out there it is.\n\n167\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.770\nIt's there, it's not missing.\n\n168\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.150\nWe don't have a missing link in\nthe links panel any more, it's perfect.\n\n169\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.960\nSo that's something we need to.\n\n170\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.920\nWe need to maintain that library.\n\n171\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.480\nAnd that library file, I'm gonna actually\njust jump out to the desktop and\n\n172\n00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.780\nwe can actually see where that library,\nit's just a library item,\n\n173\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.740\nlike I said it's a .indl file.\n\n174\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.220\nI can give this library item,\nthis library file to anybody else so\n\n175\n00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.380\nthat they have the information as well.\n\n176\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.920\nIt can be kept on a server.\n\n177\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.080\nThere are some issues\nwith certain servers,\n\n178\n00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.770\nespecially Windows servers don't\nplay nicely with libraries.\n\n179\n00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.000\nIf you're working in group\nenvironment whether it's at school or\n\n180\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.100\nif it's for a Job and\nyou've got all these libraries.\n\n181\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.870\nGenerally you want to have someone who\ntheir job is to maintain the libraries and\n\n182\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.090\nmake sure that they are the most current\nones as well, because otherwise,\n\n183\n00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.870\nyou will keep getting those missing links.\n\n184\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.770\nBut it is a file that you can just hand\noff because as far as like the links go,\n\n185\n00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.660\nall it really does is it's just told\nin design where to find that file.\n\n186\n00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.980\nNow if the item was something\nthat was created and\n\n187\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.140\nin design, whether it's text, this one is\ntext, let's actually just drag this out.\n\n188\n00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.220\nSo I've just got this travel quote,\nI'm gonna pull it out and drop it here.\n\n189\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.120\nAnd it came out as actually formatted\nexactly like my poll quotes, and\n\n190\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.550\nthat's because I have that font loaded.\n\n191\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.120\nIf I didn't have that font loaded,\nand I dragged that quote out,\n\n192\n00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.430\nit's gonna come up and\nshow me that the font needs to be updated.\n\n193\n00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.560\nSo again all it did is it said,\nyou've formatted it like this, and\n\n194\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.670\nit looks like this, and it uses this\nfont and these colors and these styles.\n\n195\n00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.740\nAnd I'm gonna recreate it for\nyou when I drag it under the page.\n\n196\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.375\nIf it doesn't have the elements\nit needs Needs to recreate it.\n\n197\n00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:51.855\nYou'll have to update it manually,\n\n198\n00:09:51.855 --> 00:09:55.035\nand then again you can recreate\nit back to the library.\n\n199\n00:09:55.035 --> 00:09:59.595\nSo how do things get into\na library to begin with?\n\n200\n00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:03.267\nWell, they have to be put\nonto an InDesign page.\n\n201\n00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:07.217\nSo whether it's an image that we place,\njust like we place normally and we decide,\n\n202\n00:10:07.217 --> 00:10:08.987\nhm I'm gonna use that picture again.\n\n203\n00:10:08.987 --> 00:10:12.467\nLet's drag that into a library,\nwe just drag it right back in.\n\n204\n00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:15.790\nSo for instance, I can come over here and\nI'll create something.\n\n205\n00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.770\nSo whether it's text or\n\n206\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.890\nit's just a shape I'm just gonna\ncreate a really simple shape.\n\n207\n00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.170\nAnd then I can say,\nokay I want to go ahead.\n\n208\n00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.340\nAnd let's actually scroll down in here and\nget this color.\n\n209\n00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.620\nAnd I wanna put this shape into my\nlibrary, into my wild items library.\n\n210\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.900\nSo, anything that's Is created in\nInDesign, not placed in InDesign,\n\n211\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.210\nbut actually created in InDesign.\n\n212\n00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:42.960\nAnd like vector art work or text, is just\nwhen you put it back out, it recreates it.\n\n213\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.760\nSo for vector images and shapes we're\ncreated in InDesign, you won't ever end\n\n214\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.310\nup with anything missing because all\nit says it, this was how it was built.\n\n215\n00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.660\nWhen it pulls it back onto the page,\n\n216\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.380\nit rebuilds it exactly\nwith the same information.\n\n217\n00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.060\nBut to get it in there I have a couple\ndifferent choices, I could just drag this\n\n218\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.760\nitem in, just drag it in there, and\nnow I have that item in my library.\n\n219\n00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.720\nIf I double-click on it,\n\n220\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.660\nthis is where I tell it what\nit's named and give it keywords.\n\n221\n00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.110\nSo we'll just call this orange Square,\ncuz we'll need to use that again, right?\n\n222\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.220\nSo I'm just coming down, and usually I\njust repeat the same information here.\n\n223\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.010\nOrange square, I might put rectangle,\nanything else that I might need to do.\n\n224\n00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.600\nIf it's something that I'm\nusing as a color bar, or\n\n225\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.880\nif I'm using it as a header,\nI don't know background or\n\n226\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.840\nsomething like that, I might color that\nif it's specific to that particular job.\n\n227\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.440\nSo that's how I get things in there.\n\n228\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.020\nThe other way to get things in,\nis I can use the panel menu.\n\n229\n00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.320\nI'm gonna come over here, to this page.\n\n230\n00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.490\nI'm gonna delete a couple of these items,\nthe ones we just put in here.\n\n231\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.040\nAnd I wanna add all these items\nI could do a select all, CMD or\n\n232\n00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.130\nCTRL + a to select all.\n\n233\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.820\nAnd I can either drag this in,\nlike I said, or\n\n234\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.370\nI can use the panel menu to\nadd the items on this page,\n\n235\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.260\nand I'm on a master page that's\nprobably not a good idea.\n\n236\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.310\nWe don't wanna show you\nthe bad way to do it.\n\n237\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.810\nI'm gonna come over here,\nlet's add a bunch given the images here.\n\n238\n00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.020\nSo, I'm gonna select off of that and\nactually it's gonna select the images and\n\n239\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.200\nwords, and\nit's not gonna grab the master page items,\n\n240\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.570\nbecause those are stuck\nto the master page.\n\n241\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.970\nI'm gonna select all,\ngo back to my library and I can say,\n\n242\n00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.990\nadd all items on page seven, or\nI can also add them as separate objects.\n\n243\n00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.700\nSo if you've created a ton\nof objects on a page,\n\n244\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.200\nmaybe you've done a bunch of shapes and\nyou want to use those over and over again,\n\n245\n00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.810\nor maybe, you're making a map and\nyou've got the legend, the little keys.\n\n246\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.220\nYou've got campground and parking and\ntrail heads and all that great stuff, and\n\n247\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.060\nyou've laid them all out\non a page in InDesign.\n\n248\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.580\nI can either drag them all in together,\nor add them together.\n\n249\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.270\nPut them in the same spot\nas a nice layout, but\n\n250\n00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.620\nmaybe you just wanted all\nof this individual items.\n\n251\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.830\nI can say add them as separate objects,\nand instead of having to drag each one\n\n252\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.270\nindividually, I can select them all and\nadd them all as separate objects.\n\n253\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.040\nIn this case,\nI'm going to add all the together.\n\n254\n00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.370\nSo, now when I do that,\nI can come down and I can see, and again,\n\n255\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.290\nthe thumbnails are not huge, but\nI can see that that's an entire layout.\n\n256\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.630\nAnd where that comes in handy is if\nI jump out to a brand new document\n\n257\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.510\nand I wanna place this item.\n\n258\n00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.850\nI can either drag it back out or\njust say place item on that page.\n\n259\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:21.950\nAnd when I do, it places them, because\nit's the same exact size page layout.\n\n260\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.630\nIt puts it in the same exact place.\n\n261\n00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.700\nNow, if I change the size of the page,\n\n262\n00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.920\nit's going to plop it\nusually in the middle.\n\n263\n00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.300\nIt just depends on what you have set up\nway up here in the upper left-hand corner\n\n264\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.970\nas to the reference point\nwhere it sits on the page.\n\n265\n00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.880\nSo obviously, if you put it on a smaller\npage, things are gonna hang off the edge,\n\n266\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.010\nit might not work exactly.\n\n267\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:42.050\nBut, if you know that you're\ngonna use this layout, again,\n\n268\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.100\nthat's one way to do it.\n\n269\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.790\nWe can either do it as a template,\nwe can do it as a master page,\n\n270\n00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.780\nwe can copy and paste, or\nwe can put things in a library and\n\n271\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.330\npull that out even if we're gonna\nchange out the images later.\n\n272\n00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:56.190\nAnd again, what that did is the same as if\nI had gone and found all those images and\n\n273\n00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.270\nplaced each of those.\n\n274\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.670\nSo here's all my links as if I placed\nthem all, laid them out, it also said,\n\n275\n00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.060\nthis this was the font\nthat you used last time.\n\n276\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.860\nThis is how we need to redraw\nit here as well, so, again,\n\n277\n00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.980\njust remembers where everything is.\n\n278\n00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.670\nAll right, so let's come down here and\nImma show you how to create a new library.\n\n279\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.480\nSo I'm gonna do file, new, and\n\n280\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.790\ninstead of doing new document that we've\nbeen doing we're gonna do new library.\n\n281\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:23.970\nSo, it's going to ask me.\n\n282\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:24.950\nIt's going to give me this right now.\n\n283\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.200\nIf you're on Creative Cloud,\n\n284\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.460\nit is going to let you know that\nyou can use CC Library, as well.\n\n285\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.540\nI feel like they're really\npushing you to use that.\n\n286\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.100\nAnd I'm going to show you why you may or\nmay not want to use that.\n\n287\n00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.370\nObviously if you're not in Creative Cloud,\n\n288\n00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.310\nyou're not going to get this,\nI can tell it don't show again, as well.\n\n289\n00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:43.680\nSo, I'm going to say no, I don't want it\ntry out CC Libraries Just Jet I just wanna\n\n290\n00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.400\nmake an old fashion library.\n\n291\n00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.940\nAnd it automatically says,\n\n292\n00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:52.290\nit's going to be called something.indl and\nthen just save it out where ever you want.\n\n293\n00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.450\nThat file does not need to sit\nwith any specific document.\n\n294\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.600\nFor instance for\nme if I'm doing a whole bunch of logos for\n\n295\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.670\na client,\nI'm gonna throw that in the client folder.\n\n296\n00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.530\nIf it's my own,\n\n297\n00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.350\nI'm gonna put Put it in my folder\nwherever I keep my graphics and my logos.\n\n298\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.300\nI just have a nice library that\nkeeps track of everything.\n\n299\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.440\nWhen I put it in a folder that sits\nin the same folder as all my logos,\n\n300\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.700\nthen it's there in my face and reminding\nme, yes, I need to make sure that when I\n\n301\n00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.710\nupdate my logo that I need to\nupdate my library as well.\n\n302\n00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.620\nSo I'll just go ahead and\nsave this right here and library.\n\n303\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.390\nAnd we'll just call this a new ID library.\n\n304\n00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.870\nAnd now I have that as well.\n\n305\n00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:35.230\nIt automatically keeps it in\nthis library panel group.\n\n306\n00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.830\nSo I can have multiple\nlibraries open at one time.\n\n307\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.820\nSo right now, I have a big blank library.\n\n308\n00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.553\nSo I'm gonna do the same thing that we\njust did with all these items on the page,\n\n309\n00:15:44.553 --> 00:15:45.358\ndo a Select All.\n\n310\n00:15:45.358 --> 00:15:50.260\nAnd I'm gonna go up to the Panel menu and\nchoose Add Items as Separate Objects.\n\n311\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:55.068\nSo when I do that, now I have each\nof these items as a separate item.\n\n312\n00:15:55.068 --> 00:15:57.625\nOn my, in my library.\n\n313\n00:15:57.625 --> 00:16:00.100\nSo now, when I just need one picture,\nit's fine.\n\n314\n00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.690\nIf I just need the word safaris,\nI can just grab that.\n\n315\n00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.880\nIf I just need the quote,\nI can just grab that.\n\n316\n00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.500\nNow, some of them have names.\n\n317\n00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.940\nThat's because they are an image and it\nautomatically tags it with the image name.\n\n318\n00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.780\nSome of them have nothing because it was\nsomething that was created in InDesign, so\n\n319\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.320\nit has no reference as what\nthat should be called.\n\n320\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.678\nSo, obviously,\nI can't even see what that is.\n\n321\n00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.551\nI'm assuming that's the safari text.\n\n322\n00:16:21.551 --> 00:16:24.929\nBut, again, I can't see it even if\nI put the large thumbnail view,\n\n323\n00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:27.560\nI still can't see what that's called.\n\n324\n00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.194\nThumbnails, not super handy, especially\nif I throw everything on the page and\n\n325\n00:16:31.194 --> 00:16:34.120\nI think, okay, I gotta drag it\noff sometimes just to go, yeah,\n\n326\n00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.335\nthat was the safari text.\n\n327\n00:16:35.335 --> 00:16:38.700\nThen we double-click on it,\nand then we'll add that.\n\n328\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.490\nSo I'll put safari, I might put wording,\nsomething like that.\n\n329\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:43.030\nSo, again,\n\n330\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:47.085\nthat's just some way to keep track of\nitems that we use again and again.\n\n331\n00:16:47.085 --> 00:16:50.320\nAnd it goes back to thinking\nhow you need to work.\n\n332\n00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.830\nAnd if you're starting out, this is\nsomething that you're just starting\n\n333\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.850\nout on, this just gives you ideas\nof how you would need to work.\n\n334\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.160\nHow often do I think I would\nwant to pull individual items,\n\n335\n00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.670\nversus how often do I\nwant this whole layout?\n\n336\n00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.590\nIf I want this whole layout,\nI might drag it in as one item.\n\n337\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:09.620\nIf I think, the elements are nice,\nbut they're always gonna be different,\n\n338\n00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.390\nthen I would drag them\nin as separate items, or\n\n339\n00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.230\nmaybe libraries isn't even the option for\nyou.\n\n340\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:20.120\nMaybe you need to make templates, because\na template lets you take the entire\n\n341\n00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.170\ndocument, and\nwe did that in an earlier episode.\n\n342\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:23.405\nWe just saved it as a template.\n\n343\n00:17:23.405 --> 00:17:26.930\nI didn't talk about how to do templates,\nthat's sort of a little more advanced.\n\n344\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.900\nBut for me, when I think do I want\na template, or would I throw this all in\n\n345\n00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:35.210\na library, a template, for me, means that\nthe structure of the page, or the pages,\n\n346\n00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.020\nI know I might have twelve pages,\nmaybe it's a template for a newsletter.\n\n347\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.050\nI know that I'm gonna have the same layout\nof this newsletter over and over again.\n\n348\n00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:46.600\nThe images are going to change, but\nmaybe where the images sit are the same.\n\n349\n00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.760\nAnd obviously the headers are going to be\nthe same, the footers, the page numbers.\n\n350\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.790\nAll those I want to be consistent\nfrom month to month or whatever for\n\n351\n00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.610\nmy newsletter, and so, for me,\nI think, okay, that's a template.\n\n352\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.870\nBut now the logos,\nthe logos go everywhere, so\n\n353\n00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.580\nthose would go into a library.\n\n354\n00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.110\nOne of the other things that I like\nto use libraries for is crop marks.\n\n355\n00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.340\nSo, I don't know if you work in,\nespecially a print environment,\n\n356\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.040\nyou've got to make business cards,\nand you never make one on a page,\n\n357\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.620\nit's always multiple on a page.\n\n358\n00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.940\nSo you need crop marks and\nyou need guides.\n\n359\n00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.460\nAnd so, we saw in a previous episode\nwhere we put the guides in there.\n\n360\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.830\nAnd I don't wanna have to\ndraw those out every time.\n\n361\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:28.640\nSo I can put that as a set, all my crops\nand guides in one layout in a library.\n\n362\n00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.300\nSo that's whether or\n\n363\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.930\nnot I'm doing four up business cards,\n10 up business cards, anything like that.\n\n364\n00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.140\nI can lay that out and\nnot have to worry about that again.\n\n365\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.000\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up\na new document, command or control n, and\n\n366\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.990\njust have a new document.\n\n367\n00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.890\nActually, I lied,\nI don't want that layout.\n\n368\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:42.990\nLet's do New.\n\n369\n00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.090\nBut I wanna do a half page layout,\nbecause for me, if I'm doing, say, for\n\n370\n00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.370\na business card, I'm probably gonna\nput that on an 8.5 by 5.5 sheet.\n\n371\n00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.300\nAgain, if that's not your environment,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n372\n00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.950\nBut think about where would\nI use something like this?\n\n373\n00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.560\nWhat is it I hate to draw out over and\nover again that's always the same?\n\n374\n00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.370\nFor me, it's crop marks and guides.\n\n375\n00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.300\nEspecially if we're doing something like\nfour up business cards with a bleed.\n\n376\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.540\nI put it in the portrait orientation.\n\n377\n00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.050\nI want it in landscape.\n\n378\n00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:09.920\nSo I can always fix that.\n\n379\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.420\nI can either restart it or\nrecreate a new document, or go to file and\n\n380\n00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.640\nsay document set up.\n\n381\n00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.200\nI'm gonna change that,\nand just make that wide.\n\n382\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.830\nI just wanna lay it out like that.\n\n383\n00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.840\nAnd I need to open up the library\nthat has my crop marks in it.\n\n384\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.800\nSo I'm gonna go to the file menu, and\nchoose open, and come in here, and\n\n385\n00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.920\nI have one called crops.\n\n386\n00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:30.810\nAnd I just have two in here.\n\n387\n00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.730\nI have 4-up Business Cards,\nand then I have Postcards.\n\n388\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.290\nNow, for me, when I pull out guides,\nnow, keep in mind,\n\n389\n00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.930\nwhen I put those on the page they might\nnot sit exactly where I want them to.\n\n390\n00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.285\nIn this case, though, my four up business\ncards, I know I set up on an 8.5 by 5.5.\n\n391\n00:19:44.285 --> 00:19:46.360\nNow, this is something you\ncould do as a template.\n\n392\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.885\nBut for me, I don't know if the four up\nbusiness card is going to go on an 8.5,\n\n393\n00:19:50.885 --> 00:19:52.090\n5.5, or a 6 by 9.\n\n394\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:57.340\nSo, for me, if I had it as a template, I\nwould have to have each page size set up,\n\n395\n00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.950\nor I can do it as a library item,\nand I can put those on there and\n\n396\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.522\njust move them where they\nneed to go on the page.\n\n397\n00:20:02.522 --> 00:20:04.670\nNow, I'm gonna try and drag it off and\n\n398\n00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.520\nshow you what happens when you try\nto drag something that has guides.\n\n399\n00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.670\nIt yells at you,\nit tells you you cant do that.\n\n400\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.410\nYou can't do drag and drop if you have\nguides as part of the library item,\n\n401\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.590\nwhether that's into the library or\nout of the library.\n\n402\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.090\nAnd that's because guides are infinite, so\n\n403\n00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.130\nthere is just no way for\nit to drag it off the page.\n\n404\n00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:20.760\nSo I say, okay.\n\n405\n00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.770\nSo, what I need to do\nis use the place item.\n\n406\n00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.510\nSo I'm just gonna choose place item, and\nwhen I put that on there, hopefully you\n\n407\n00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.220\ncan see it, it's a little light, but\nI have my layout already put on there.\n\n408\n00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.770\nI've got the guides on there,\nI've got the crop marks, and\n\n409\n00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:36.510\nif I move this guy out of the way,\nI'm gonna double-click just to shrink up\n\n410\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:41.610\nthat panel, I can see that I've got my\nguides and my crop marks ready to go.\n\n411\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.850\nSo now, when I'm ready to create this four\nup business card, all I had to do was\n\n412\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.780\ngrab that crop library,\nplace it on the page and I'm ready to go.\n\n413\n00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.550\nNow, think if you had something\nlike a four up, or an eight up or\n\n414\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.480\na ten up business card,\ncard with bleeds, and if you're used\n\n415\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.800\nto working with bleeds you know you\nhave to have a gutter between each.\n\n416\n00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.330\nThat's a lot of crop marks and\na lot of guides.\n\n417\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.555\nSo, having that already\nset up on a page or\n\n418\n00:21:01.555 --> 00:21:04.390\non a library item is a quick\nway to put that in there.\n\n419\n00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.820\nSo, I have just a separate library\nthat is just all my crops and guides.\n\n420\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.980\nJust a quick way to think about that.\n\n421\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.930\nThat's the end design libraries.\n\n422\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.420\nNow, there's the CC libraries as well.\n\n423\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:19.060\nSo, what the advantage to the CC library\nand the advantage to the Creative Cloud\n\n424\n00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.730\nin general is that you have this central\nrepository that is in the cloud,\n\n425\n00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.890\nthat you can get to all your items,\nno matter where you are.\n\n426\n00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.870\nIf you're on your machine, or if you're on\nsomeone elses machine, you can actually\n\n427\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:36.500\nstill log into your Adobe account and\nget those assets from the cloud.\n\n428\n00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.210\nAnd with the Creative Cloud library,\nI can put anything into this library and\n\n429\n00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.440\nI can also share that library with others.\n\n430\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.400\nAgain it's a whole concept\nthat I can probably\n\n431\n00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.020\ntalk all day on about Creative Cloud and\nall that, but\n\n432\n00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.380\njust know that there are the two\ndifferent types of libraries.\n\n433\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.610\nAnd at any time I can take\nthese InDesign libraries and\n\n434\n00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.500\nI can convert those to a Creative Cloud.\n\n435\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.870\nIn fact, that's down here at\nthe bottom of the Libraries panel,\n\n436\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.540\nit says Convert to a Creative Cloud,\nor Migrate Library Items.\n\n437\n00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.920\nSo I can actually send that to a library.\n\n438\n00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.390\nSo let's actually open\nup our CC libraries now.\n\n439\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:12.630\nSo I'm going to double click just\nto collapse those panels back up.\n\n440\n00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.770\nGo up under the window menu,\nand choose CC libraries.\n\n441\n00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.980\nWhen I do that,\nI get the CC library panel.\n\n442\n00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.890\nIt's kind of huge.\n\n443\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.860\nI can shrink that down, and\nthere's a lot of stuff in the libraries.\n\n444\n00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.550\nSo the libraries are things like colors.\n\n445\n00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.410\nAre color themes, if you're creating color\nthemes using the Capture app or anything.\n\n446\n00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.590\nAnd again, this is all Creative Cloud\nstuff, different course all together,\n\n447\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.320\nbut feel free to go out and\nexplore and see what is out there.\n\n448\n00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.890\nEspecially if you have the cloud,\nyou're paying for it,\n\n449\n00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.530\nyou might as well explore it and\nsee what you can do with it.\n\n450\n00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.360\nSo at the top here I have all\nthe different libraries that I have,\n\n451\n00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.840\nthese are CC Libraries, and\nI can just place this in here.\n\n452\n00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.790\nI have one called wild photo logos.\n\n453\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.240\nSo in here,\nI have things like color themes.\n\n454\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.540\nThese are themes that I\njust dragged in there.\n\n455\n00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.920\nI probably would not use all\nthese different themes in my wild\n\n456\n00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.630\nphotography stuff obviously.\n\n457\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.310\nIt's just I have a lot in there for\ndemo purposes, but\n\n458\n00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.800\nI also have down here graphics\nmove this up a little bit.\n\n459\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.260\nAnd I can look and see that I have\nthese three graphics here, and\n\n460\n00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.460\nthese are the two, basically the same two\nthat I have in the other library that\n\n461\n00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.270\nare here, but\nI just dragged them into that library.\n\n462\n00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:21.235\nSame as if it was a InDesign library,\nthat can take InDesign library,\n\n463\n00:23:21.235 --> 00:23:25.025\ndrag it onto the page and\nthen drag it into the library as well.\n\n464\n00:23:25.025 --> 00:23:27.785\nI am going to go ahead and\nadd that and it puts it into a nice\n\n465\n00:23:27.785 --> 00:23:31.595\nlittle category it says okay that's\nartwork, it kinda separates everything.\n\n466\n00:23:31.595 --> 00:23:33.349\nIf I go back to that text that I have,\n\n467\n00:23:33.349 --> 00:23:36.055\nlet's say that we want\n[INAUDIBLE] quote that's here.\n\n468\n00:23:36.055 --> 00:23:41.063\nNow when I drag this into the CC library,\nit doesn't actually, I mean it adds\n\n469\n00:23:41.063 --> 00:23:46.014\nit as a graphic, but I can also tell it\nthat I want to add it as a style instead.\n\n470\n00:23:46.014 --> 00:23:49.896\nSo I can come in here and\ngo to the panel menu, and go ahead,\n\n471\n00:23:49.896 --> 00:23:54.596\nI want to Whoops, I can actually just\nselect the text and drag that in.\n\n472\n00:23:54.596 --> 00:23:56.650\nIt should actually bring it in as style.\n\n473\n00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.120\nThere we go, sorry.\n\n474\n00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.540\nDown here at the bottom add a character\nstyle or a paragraph style.\n\n475\n00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.435\nSo instead of dragging it in as a graphic,\nI've got the text selected and\n\n476\n00:24:06.435 --> 00:24:09.297\nI'd like to save that as a character or\nparagraph style.\n\n477\n00:24:09.297 --> 00:24:10.813\nNow it's set up as a paragraph style.\n\n478\n00:24:10.813 --> 00:24:13.310\nWe're gonna do styles\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n479\n00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.780\nBut I have styles applied to this text so\n\n480\n00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.160\nit's says would you like to put\nit in here as a paragraph style?\n\n481\n00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.305\nSo I say sure, and I do that and now I've\ngot this paragraph style which actually\n\n482\n00:24:23.305 --> 00:24:25.335\ntells me what font it was,\nwhat size and all that.\n\n483\n00:24:25.335 --> 00:24:27.925\nAnd all the information\nthat's in a paragraph style\n\n484\n00:24:27.925 --> 00:24:31.135\nis now in here which means I can\nuse that in other documents.\n\n485\n00:24:31.135 --> 00:24:33.730\nSo, I know I always have\nthe same text set up.\n\n486\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:38.470\nKeep in mind that InDesign lets you grab\nparagraph styles and character styles and\n\n487\n00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.620\nput them into a CC library.\n\n488\n00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.340\nThe other programs that actually\ncan access CC libraries,\n\n489\n00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.840\nlike Illustrator and Photoshop,\ncan't handle paragraph styles.\n\n490\n00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.500\nThey can only handle character styles.\n\n491\n00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.650\nSo just keep that in mind,\nthat if you put a paragraph style in here,\n\n492\n00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.820\nyou might not be able to access it in\nother programs that you wanna use.\n\n493\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.390\nSo for me, if I just want the text and\nI wanna remember that I used,\n\n494\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.190\nwhatever it was,\n23 point Rockwell in here.\n\n495\n00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.950\nI'll add it as a character style, so\nat least I can see that when I get\n\n496\n00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.510\ninto Photoshop and I wanna start\nlaying something out in Photoshop, and\n\n497\n00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.360\nI wanna use the same text,\nI will have that available to me.\n\n498\n00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.350\nBut again it's just a nice repository.\n\n499\n00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.194\nIt keeps it synced so\nas soon as I make changes,\n\n500\n00:25:15.194 --> 00:25:21.190\niIf I make changes to something from a CC\nlibrary, if I were to pull this out and\n\n501\n00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.540\nmake changes here, I can't actually\nmake changes cuz that's a placed item.\n\n502\n00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.740\nBut if I grab something,\nlet's say, the paragraph style and\n\n503\n00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.740\nI made changes to that,\nif I go into Photoshop and\n\n504\n00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.180\nI have that same library open,\nthose changes are instant.\n\n505\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.040\nSo that it does have the two way\ncommunication that you don't have\n\n506\n00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.620\nin the InDesign library.\n\n507\n00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.500\nSo like I said, I think they're\nobviously migrating to that.\n\n508\n00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.530\nIt seems kind of almost cumbersome\nnow to have two sets of libraries\n\n509\n00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.680\nalthough I do use them very differently.\n\n510\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.930\nI don't find that the organization\nof the libraries, the CC libraries,\n\n511\n00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.240\nare quite there yet.\n\n512\n00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.550\nThey're just sort of in\nthis really long list.\n\n513\n00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.360\nAnd also,\nthey all live somewhere else, and\n\n514\n00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.380\nthey don't work into the file hierarchy\nthat I'm used to using in my work flow.\n\n515\n00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.750\nIf you're just getting started,\n\n516\n00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:11.190\nthough, you might just be wise to start\nusing just the Creative Cloud library,\n\n517\n00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.920\nbecause those InDesign libraries\nmay go away at some point.\n\n518\n00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.900\nAnd also, this is kind of where things\nare going for workflow, I think.\n\n519\n00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.920\nIt's just they're not quite there yet\nfor me, for my organizational,\n\n520\n00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.850\nthe way I like to organize things.\n\n521\n00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:25.690\nBut I love that it's instant.\n\n522\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.790\nIf I open up Illustrator, I go to\na friend's house and I'm like, hey,\n\n523\n00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.230\nlet me show you this thing\nI made in Illustrator,\n\n524\n00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.160\nI can log into my Adobe account and\nthere's everything that I created.\n\n525\n00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.320\nI don't have to worry about, it's on\nmy other machine or anything like that.\n\n526\n00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.960\nIf you work at home and\nyou've got your school computer or\n\n527\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.640\nyour work computer,\nyou can have it on both as well.\n\n528\n00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.320\nAnd so you always have access to\nthe items that you've created.\n\n529\n00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.300\nSo I think the Creative Cloud libraries\nare actually pretty cool as well.\n\n530\n00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.520\nSo that is libraries in a nutshell.\n\n531\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.460\n>> All right, very good.\n\n532\n00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.510\nYou know it's interesting,\nthe debate today,\n\n533\n00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.950\nlocal storage versus the cloud storage,\nand as we've seen, and\n\n534\n00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.110\nas you've seen Erica mention, everything\ndoes seem to be going to the cloud.\n\n535\n00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.000\nSo who knows what we'll\nsee in a couple years.\n\n536\n00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.260\nNow Erica, it does look like we're\nrunning to the end of another episode,\n\n537\n00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.880\nbut before you sign off,\ndo you have additional words on libraries?\n\n538\n00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.777\n>> No.\nJust keep in mind where it is,\n\n539\n00:27:13.777 --> 00:27:17.420\nhow you wanna work and\nwhich library would work best for you.\n\n540\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.240\n>> All right, very good.\n\n541\n00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.960\nWell, thank you for\nbeing here in the studio and\n\n542\n00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.130\nthank you to the viewer watching.\n\n543\n00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.731\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n544\n00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:24.424\n>> And I'm Erica

00:00:15.904\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:17.107\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:20.880\nwe're continuing along through our\nAdobe Create a Cloud 2015 series.\n\n6\n00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.240\nMore specifically, we're coming\nback at you with more InDesign.\n\n7\n00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.250\nJoining me back in the studios\ntoday is Erica Gamet.\n\n8\n00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.140\nErica, how are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.050\n>> I'm doing great, thanks.\n\n10\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.830\n>> All right, very good.\n\n11\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.270\nSo we've been taking this\njourney through InDesign.\n\n12\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.440\nWhat's our next destination?\n\n13\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.080\n>> We're going to talk about styles.\n\n14\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.991\n>> All right, very good.\n\n15\n00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:37.851\n>> All right, so styles is a great\nway to do the same thing over and\n\n16\n00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:41.390\nover again without having to actually\ndo the same thing over and over again.\n\n17\n00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.560\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n18\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.620\nIt means that all the stuff that we've\ndone in all these prior episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.075\nWe're styling text, we're styling\ntext frames, we're styling objects,\n\n20\n00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:53.115\nwe're putting drop shadows and\ndifferent effects on there.\n\n21\n00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.135\nWe've done that over and over again, but\n\n22\n00:00:55.135 --> 00:01:01.025\nI don't want to have to do that every time\nI want the same looking item on my page.\n\n23\n00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:02.480\nI want to save those as a style.\n\n24\n00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.920\nYou might also hear the term style sheets.\n\n25\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.540\nThey'll be just called some styles.\n\n26\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.280\nAnd so basically we can format\nsomething and then create a style so\n\n27\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.890\nthat next time we wanna format it,\nwe just click on it and\n\n28\n00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.970\nit formats it beautifully we\ndon't have to think about it.\n\n29\n00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.550\nNow why do we use that?\n\n30\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.530\nFor consistency for one thing and\nalso to make it easier and faster.\n\n31\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.210\nBut for me,\nconsistency is the huge benefit of that,\n\n32\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.050\nbecause I don't wanna be trying to\nkeep track of what size type I used,\n\n33\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.680\nor what size frame, or\nwhat the frame looked like,\n\n34\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.020\nany of the qualities that it had, and then\nbe worried that when I do another job for\n\n35\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.670\nthat same client, or whatever,\nthat it looks slightly different.\n\n36\n00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.830\nSo, consistency is huge,\nand also time saving.\n\n37\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.790\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlook at how I build styles, and\n\n38\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.680\nwe're gonna start with text styles,\nnot textiles, but text styles.\n\n39\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.900\nAnd so there are two different types,\nthere are character styles and\n\n40\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.020\nparagraph styles.\n\n41\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.700\nAnd I'm just gonna start with a big\nold blank page, cuz this is kind of\n\n42\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.410\nhow I start when I'm creating styles,\nthose paragraph and character styles.\n\n43\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.040\nSo I'm gonna open up each panel,\ncharacter styles and paragraph styles.\n\n44\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.960\nAnd these kind of look, or the information\nthat's in the paragraph, and\n\n45\n00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.030\nthe character styles, are the same thing\nthat you find in the paragraph and\n\n46\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.080\ncharacter panels, and\nI am gonna start with paragraph styles.\n\n47\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.010\nSo start with that on top.\n\n48\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.710\nIn fact, I'm gonna use character styles,\njust move him out of the way for now.\n\n49\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.220\nAnd paragraph styles, and\nit's a little confusing only that\n\n50\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.320\nsome of the information that goes in\na paragraph, is actually stuff that you\n\n51\n00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.990\nenter in the character panel to\nstart with, and here's why that is.\n\n52\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.810\nA paragraph style, and\nI kind of liken this to building a house,\n\n53\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.590\nnot that I know anything about building\na house, but I've seen them built.\n\n54\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.010\nWhen you look at when\na house is being built,\n\n55\n00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.440\nyou've got a lot of common elements.\n\n56\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.730\nYou've got the foundation.\n\n57\n00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.200\nAnd you've got the framing.\n\n58\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.880\nRight?\nNo matter what\n\n59\n00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.520\nthe house is gonna look like, you've got\nsome kind of foundation and framing.\n\n60\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.160\nAnd that is what your paragraph style is.\n\n61\n00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.410\nSo it's sort of the base of what your\nparagraph is going to look like.\n\n62\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.950\nSo things that actually go into\nthat are things like the alignment,\n\n63\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.940\nthe hyphenation, things we put in\nthe paragraph panel when we started.\n\n64\n00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.910\nHowever, the other thing that you\nhave is part of that base and\n\n65\n00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.880\nthat paragraph is the font, and the size,\nthe type size, and the letting.\n\n66\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.260\nEven though that's a character based\nsetting, it's sort of like, but\n\n67\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.080\nthe whole paragraph is going to have that\nfont in that size, for the most part.\n\n68\n00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.040\nNow going back to the house analogy,\neach room has different,\n\n69\n00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.170\nlet's say, texture on the walls,\ndifferent paint, different decor.\n\n70\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.420\nEverything that gives that\nroom its character, and\n\n71\n00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.900\nthat's what a character style is like.\n\n72\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.280\nIt's sort of the exception to the rule.\n\n73\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.450\nSo your paragraph style might have\nsomething where it might have 10 point\n\n74\n00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.060\ntype with 12 point letting, Palatino.\n\n75\n00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.270\nBut certain words we might want\nto be bold italic or in green or\n\n76\n00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.670\nsomething like that, and so\nthat would be a character style.\n\n77\n00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.200\nSo we have paragraph styles\nas the foundation and\n\n78\n00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.240\non top of that, character styles\nalways go on top of paragraph styles.\n\n79\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.910\nSo we have a paragraph style that says\nthis is what the paragraph basically looks\n\n80\n00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.520\nlike, except for these things, and\nthat's where we apply a character style.\n\n81\n00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.770\nSo that's all going to come into play.\n\n82\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.250\nHopefully, it will make a lot\nmore sense than my analogy,\n\n83\n00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.240\nwhen we actually start\nputting stuff on the page.\n\n84\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.800\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n85\n00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.370\nSo, for me,\n\n86\n00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.080\nI'm not the type of person that will say,\nokay, I'm ready to lay this out.\n\n87\n00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.840\nLet me think about what\nthis will look like.\n\n88\n00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.350\nIt will be 10 point or 12 point\".\n\n89\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.910\nI'm not going to map all that out.\n\n90\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.500\nThat's not how I work.\n\n91\n00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.100\nI throw some text on a page.\n\n92\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.650\nSo I'm going to use my type tool,\ncreate a text frame,\n\n93\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.510\nuse my keyboard shortcut that I set\nup F2 to fill placeholder text.\n\n94\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.090\nIf you don't have a keyboard\nshortcut it's under the type menu,\n\n95\n00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.550\nfill with placeholder text.\n\n96\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.240\nAnd I'm just gonna throw\nsome text on the page.\n\n97\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.250\nI'm also going to zoom in a little bit so\nwe can see a little better.\n\n98\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.440\nAnd I said in a prior episode when we were\ntalking about just styling paragraphs,\n\n99\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.290\nnot paragraph styles, but we were just\nputting some style into our paragraphs,\n\n100\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.310\nthat you only have to have\nyour cursor in the paragraph.\n\n101\n00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.540\nWell because I'm actually going to be\nadding things like font information,\n\n102\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.030\nI need to have at least\none character selected.\n\n103\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.240\nSo generally, I'll put stuff\non the page and I'll style it.\n\n104\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.020\nLet's just say I like this,\nit looks great,\n\n105\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.420\nlet's make this a little bit smaller.\n\n106\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.250\nWe'll make this 18 point and then maybe\nwe'll make this 21 point letting.\n\n107\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.290\nAnd maybe we'll even make it justified.\n\n108\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.430\nRight?\nSo I just went ahead and\n\n109\n00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.870\nstyled it and I think,\nI like the way that looks.\n\n110\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.850\nThat's what my body text needs to look\nlike, and for me, I tend to start with\n\n111\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.120\nbody text, because we're gonna see that\nwe can base styles on other styles.\n\n112\n00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.480\nSo for me, I think what is\nthe text that's going to be\n\n113\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.060\nthroughout this entire document,\nor the majority of it.\n\n114\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.920\nWell, if it's a novel or something,\nwe're gonna have a lot of body text.\n\n115\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.840\nWhatever your situation is,\nit can be entirely different.\n\n116\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.820\nBut I think, okay, I'm gonna start\nwith this and I'm gonna style the text\n\n117\n00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.860\nhow I want, and then I'm going to\nbase other styles on top of that.\n\n118\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.350\nSo for me, I'm going to select some text.\n\n119\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.760\nI'm gonna select one word, and that's it.\n\n120\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.490\nAnd the reason I wanna select something\nis, because I don't wanna have to go and\n\n121\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.490\nput in all the information in\nthe paragraph style text box or\n\n122\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.980\nthe options box.\n\n123\n00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.510\nI want it to force feed all\nall that information in,\n\n124\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.110\nby selecting some text, when I go into\nthe paragraph style panel right now,\n\n125\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.250\nit will automatically force\nfeed all that information in.\n\n126\n00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.160\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nhave some text selected.\n\n127\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.030\nI'm gonna go down to the bottom here,\nand just choose the new style.\n\n128\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.650\nSo I'm gonna choose a new paragraph style,\nand I want to hold down the Option or\n\n129\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.770\nthe Alt key to do that.\n\n130\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.320\nWhen I do that, it forces open this dialog\nbox, otherwise it just creates it called\n\n131\n00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.900\nnew paragraph Style and\nI have to go back and double click on it.\n\n132\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.970\nSo it forces it open.\n\n133\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.110\nThe first thing is says is\nwhat do you want to call this.\n\n134\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.490\nI'm going to call this body text.\n\n135\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.690\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and just\nleave everything as is here right now.\n\n136\n00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.850\nWe'll come into that in just a second.\n\n137\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.210\nBut if I come down here to the Style\nSettings and I look, I can see that it\n\n138\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.680\nsays it's No Paragraph Style, which is\nwhat the basis is, and next [Same style].\n\n139\n00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.490\nBut it also says it's Palatino,\nit's 18 points, 21 point.\n\n140\n00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.270\nIt's justified, last line.\n\n141\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.920\nThat Optical we set up in the Character\npanel in a previous episode,\n\n142\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.370\nthe Optical Kerning.\n\n143\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.750\nBecause I have that set by default\nFault for all new documents.\n\n144\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.250\nMy optical kerning is already\nthrown in there as well.\n\n145\n00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.160\nSo anything that I have styled\nin that text that I had selected\n\n146\n00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.580\njust got force fed into here.\n\n147\n00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.550\nWhich means all I need to do\nis save the name and say okay.\n\n148\n00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.710\nThe other thing I can do is also\napply style to selection, so\n\n149\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.800\nwhere ever my text is selected, and\nbecause it's a paragraph style,\n\n150\n00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.650\nit will do it to the whole paragraph.\n\n151\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.200\nI can automatically apply that.\n\n152\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.680\nIf I don't apply that at this moment\nhere's what I have to do.I say, okay, and\n\n153\n00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.760\nthat's great, but I didn't tell\nit that this paragraph now has\n\n154\n00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.600\nthat body text paragraph\nstyle applied to it.\n\n155\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.190\nSo I just need to click on that.\n\n156\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.920\nDoesn't change anything because\nthat's exactly the information we\n\n157\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.270\nfed into that style.\n\n158\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.080\nBut now I said,\nokay great this entire paragraph,\n\n159\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.720\nin fact, I'm going to slide across here\nand also select this next paragraph.\n\n160\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.660\nSo I actually have a couple of paragraphs\nselected, and click body text.\n\n161\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.390\nI want to make sure everything\nis formatted in here.\n\n162\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.160\nNow the other thing I want to make\nsure is that I have this hard return.\n\n163\n00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.410\nI want to get rid of that return,\nso I am going to hit delete,\n\n164\n00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.427\nbut I want some extra space in there.\n\n165\n00:07:56.427 --> 00:07:59.730\nAnd when we talked about\nparagraph attributes\n\n166\n00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.718\nwe said that we could have\nspace before and space after.\n\n167\n00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:05.029\nAnd I want to.\nAdd a little bit of breathing\n\n168\n00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.619\nroom in that space.\n\n169\n00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:09.610\nSo what I'm gonna do is just\nclick in this first paragraph.\n\n170\n00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.860\nI'm gonna go up under the paragraph panel\nmenu or in this case, the control panel.\n\n171\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.520\nAnd I just wanna come over here to\nthis space that says space after and\n\n172\n00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.560\njust add a little bit extra space.\n\n173\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.450\nNow our lettering is 21 points so\nI want it to look like one full return.\n\n174\n00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:31.050\nSo, I'm going to type in 21 pt and that\nsays 21 points when I hit tab or return.\n\n175\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.750\nIt's going to go ahead and\nconvert that to inches for me, and\n\n176\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.840\nnow it looks like one hard return that's\nthere, but it's not actually there.\n\n177\n00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.270\nNow, if we go back and look up in\nthe paragraph panel here we can see\n\n178\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.390\nthat it says, there's this little plus,\nand that plus means there is an override.\n\n179\n00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.530\nSo I told it that this is body text.\n\n180\n00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.260\nBut then I made a change to it, so\n\n181\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.640\nit says it's body text but\nyou did something to it.\n\n182\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.920\nSo I have two choices here cuz one\nof our choices is not to leave that.\n\n183\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.960\nWe do not want to see pluses in\nour document when we're done.\n\n184\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.210\nBecause the whole point of using styles\nis to make sure that it's consistent.\n\n185\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.540\nI have just made it inconsistent\nby making this change.\n\n186\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.780\nSo I want to change that.\n\n187\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.120\nSo I have a couple different options.\n\n188\n00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.970\nI can either option click or\n\n189\n00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.550\nalt click on that name and it will force\nit back to the style that was there.\n\n190\n00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.170\nSo you notice it got rid\nof that space after.\n\n191\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.650\nI'm gonna undo that really quick.\n\n192\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.100\nOr the other thing I can\ndo is I can right click,\n\n193\n00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.640\ncontrol click on this and\nI can say redefine style.\n\n194\n00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.130\nSo if I redefine the style it says,\n\n195\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.480\nyou just made a change by\nadding that space afterwards.\n\n196\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.690\nI want to force feed\nthat also into the style.\n\n197\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.290\nNow, I don't have to do a refined style.\n\n198\n00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.090\nI could have come in here and\nsaid, edit the style.\n\n199\n00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.900\nSo, I could have gone ahead and\nedited the style, sorry,\n\n200\n00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.200\nright click on that and edit the style,\nand then come in here and said, okay,\n\n201\n00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.060\nlet's come down here and\nfind out where Indents and Spacing is.\n\n202\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.370\nHere's space after, and\nI could have added the same amount.\n\n203\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.550\nI'd have to say, it's 0.2917 and\ntype it in there.\n\n204\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.140\nThat is a lot of work.\n\n205\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.120\nAll I need to do is just keep changing it.\n\n206\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.410\nI will change and say,\nokay let's tweak it a little.\n\n207\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.370\nI like that.\n\n208\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.910\nLets redefine that.\n\n209\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.060\nSo not only will it redefine\nit here in this paragraph but\n\n210\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.640\nanywhere else I have that body\ntext applied also gets redefined.\n\n211\n00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.170\nTo that, so for\nme I'm constantly doing that.\n\n212\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.190\nIn fact, let's add a little bit\nmore text here in this paragraph.\n\n213\n00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.820\nI just did F2 to add a little bit more.\n\n214\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.520\nJust so I have a second paragraph.\n\n215\n00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.460\nSo these are both styled as body text.\n\n216\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.310\nSo as I make changes here\nlet's come up here and\n\n217\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.570\nsay I'm gonna take this word glasses and\nI actually want to change it to trebuchet.\n\n218\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.350\nSo change it to trebuchet regular,\nand again I get that over set, or\n\n219\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.720\nI'm sorry not the over set, the override\nand it says you've made a change again, so\n\n220\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.050\ni'm going to right click or control\nclick on that and say redefine style.\n\n221\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.908\nWhen I do that every paragraph that\nhas that paragraph applied to it,\n\n222\n00:10:49.908 --> 00:10:51.030\nalso updates.\n\n223\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.860\nSo for me, I might say okay\nthis is where I'm starting, but\n\n224\n00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.280\nalong the way I'm gonna keep making\nchanges so I'm not locked in to any thing.\n\n225\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.970\nIt's just that when I do decide to\nchange it or the client comes in and\n\n226\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.110\nsays, I hate that font.\n\n227\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.560\nWhy are you using that?\n\n228\n00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.380\nI can say, Let's change that.\n\n229\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.240\nSo again I can say, okay I like this,\nand I show it to the client and\n\n230\n00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.020\nthey're like, I hate it.\n\n231\n00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.370\nLet's use Palatino.\n\n232\n00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.126\nWell the other thing I can\ndo is go back into my item.\n\n233\n00:11:14.126 --> 00:11:19.060\nLike I said, I can either, right click or\ncontrol click and choose edit that style.\n\n234\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.715\nI can also double click on\nthe style to get it to open up and\n\n235\n00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:25.700\nmake the changes, but just know that\nwherever your cursor is sitting,\n\n236\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.620\nif you have your cursor sitting in text\nand you double click on a style to\n\n237\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.460\nedit it, you've also applied that style\nto the texture you have selected.\n\n238\n00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.820\nSo either right-click and\nyou use the edit or\n\n239\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.300\nI use the keyword short cut which is\nbasically all your modifier keys.\n\n240\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.520\nSo command or control, option or alt and\nshift and then double-click on it.\n\n241\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.660\nAnd that just says,\n\n242\n00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.740\njust ignore the fact that my cursor's\nsitting in the text and open it up.\n\n243\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.986\nSo and here I might say okay, the client\nhates that, they want Palatino, so\n\n244\n00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:55.890\nI can come here to the font family and\nchose Palatino and\n\n245\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.630\nmost of the things that are over\nhere on the left hand side\n\n246\n00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.920\nare options that you have in\nthe paragraph setting panel.\n\n247\n00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.060\nSo you can use either do it on the panel\nand say either redefine style and\n\n248\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.580\nupdate it or you can come in here and\nupdate it individually.\n\n249\n00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.790\nSo this case I'm just\ngonna say redefine that.\n\n250\n00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.160\nWhen I do that, every place that had\nthat style assigned goes ahead and\n\n251\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.670\ngets updated.\n\n252\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.720\nAlright, so let's come down here and\nmake a couple more paragraph styles.\n\n253\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.600\nThen we're gonna use character styles.\n\n254\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.120\nWe're gonna see how those\nsit on top of that.\n\n255\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.800\nSo for me, like I said,\nI started with body text.\n\n256\n00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.920\nCuz I feel like, okay,\neverything needs to be Palatino.\n\n257\n00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.330\nWe've decided we're Palatino,\nwe can always change this again later, or\n\n258\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.910\nthe client comes back and\nchanges their mind we can change it later.\n\n259\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.290\nBut for right now I think,\nokay, I like Palatino.\n\n260\n00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.920\nI also want captions,\nI might want a byline, I might want,\n\n261\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.120\nobviously a headline.\n\n262\n00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.070\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to base all of those\n\n263\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.020\non other ones, all right?\n\n264\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.140\nSo I can come in here and say I'm\ngonna draw a new text frame and for\n\n265\n00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.980\nme I'm just gonna type the word headline.\n\n266\n00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.910\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n267\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.410\nassign the paragraph style body text which\ndoesn't make sense just yet, but it will.\n\n268\n00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.840\nAnd again cuz I have my cursor in the\nparagraph I don't need to have everything\n\n269\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.550\nselected, just in the paragraph and then\nclick on that once and it assigns that.\n\n270\n00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.350\nSo right now it says Body Text.\n\n271\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.200\nBut then what I wanna do is I want to\ndouble click on that, holding down all my\n\n272\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.448\nmodifier keys again, and I wanna\nchange this and call this Headline.\n\n273\n00:13:16.448 --> 00:13:18.520\nSo buy double-clicking on that and\n\n274\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.150\nSaving it it's going to go ahead and\nI'm going to.\n\n275\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.080\nWhoops, I'm sorry, let's cancel that.\n\n276\n00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.550\nLet's click New down here\nis what I wanted to do.\n\n277\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.083\nGonna Option or Alt+Click on New.\n\n278\n00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:31.710\nSo don't double-click on it you would\nbe changing the body text style.\n\n279\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.890\nWhat I wanted was a new one and\nalways double check up here.\n\n280\n00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.010\nNew paragraph style that's what we're\ndoing and I'm gonna call this headline.\n\n281\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:43.240\nNow when I did that, because I had\noriginally assigned body text paragraph\n\n282\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.230\nstyle to that, it automatically says,\nwould you like to base it on body text?\n\n283\n00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.190\nYes I would because here's\nwhat we we're gonna do,\n\n284\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.660\nwe're gonna make our own overrides\nthat are built into this style.\n\n285\n00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.590\nAnd then anything that is common\nwill automatically be updated.\n\n286\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.570\nFor instance, I'm going to\nleave the font at Palatino but\n\n287\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.490\nI'm going to make it bold and I'm going\nto make it bigger cuz it's a headline.\n\n288\n00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.520\nAnd so, but everything that's common\nlike the font, if I update body text\n\n289\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.360\nbecause headline is based on it,\nbody text gets updated, so does headline.\n\n290\n00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.560\nSo anything that's common.\n\n291\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.390\nSo what I can look at down here and\nI can keep watching, it says okay,\n\n292\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.230\nit's Body Text + next: [Same style].\n\n293\n00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.050\nWe're gonna talk about\nnext in just a second.\n\n294\n00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.730\nSo right now it has nothing different.\n\n295\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.090\nSo I'm gonna come into the basic character\nformatting, and I'm gonna choose bold\n\n296\n00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.120\ninstead of regular, and I'm gonna\nchange it from 18 point to 30 point.\n\n297\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.880\nAnd I probably need to change\nthe lighting, I might just set it to auto.\n\n298\n00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.520\nSo I can change anything else,\nany of the spacing, the tabs.\n\n299\n00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.380\nI can put paragraph rules on it.\n\n300\n00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.470\nWe looked at that in a prior episode\nwhere we put rules above and below.\n\n301\n00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.400\nWe could do that as well.\n\n302\n00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.490\nAnything that we could do to\na paragraph we can do here.\n\n303\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.300\nBut I'm gonna leave it here and\ngo back to general and look at this.\n\n304\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:54.520\nIt's body text plus next plus bold\nplus 30 point, plus auto leading.\n\n305\n00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.620\nSo now if anything else\nchanges that's common\n\n306\n00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.090\nit will automatically update as well.\n\n307\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.240\nSo I'll say okay and I can also\napply that style to the selection.\n\n308\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.600\nSo when I do that it automatically\nchanges that, so that's headline, and\n\n309\n00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.370\nthat's body text.\n\n310\n00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.240\nI'm gonna make one more, and\nwe'll call this, we'll call this byline or\n\n311\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.760\nmaybe the author name or something\nlike that, we will just say by Author.\n\n312\n00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.330\nI tend to just type something out that\nmakes sense so I can look at that, and\n\n313\n00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.160\nI'm going to assign also, body text.\n\n314\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.610\nDo the same thing option or alt,\nwe'll call this author, and\n\n315\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:28.010\nthe he only think I'm going to do is make\nthat, let's make this slightly smaller.\n\n316\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:33.050\nWe'll make it 15 point auto letting and\nlet's make it italic.\n\n317\n00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.400\nSo do that and say OK and\nI can go back here and\n\n318\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.530\ntell it apply select style to\nselection and now I have it.\n\n319\n00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:46.590\nSo I have a headline, I have an author and\nI have a body text style.\n\n320\n00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.080\nSo, right now, I can say great, but, that\nhelped, but how did that save me time?\n\n321\n00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.400\nWell, when that client comes in and\nsays change the font,\n\n322\n00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.720\nI'm gonna hold down all my modifier keys,\ndouble click on body text.\n\n323\n00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.099\nAnd I wanna make sure, actually,\n\n324\n00:15:59.099 --> 00:16:02.303\nlet's go into author make sure it was\nbased on body text, just wanna make sure.\n\n325\n00:16:02.303 --> 00:16:07.112\nGo back to body text now, and I'm going\nto change the formatting to trebuche, and\n\n326\n00:16:07.112 --> 00:16:09.829\nwhen I do that,\nnot only does this change, but\n\n327\n00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:14.803\nthe author line changes, the headline\nchanges, everything changes Completely.\n\n328\n00:16:14.803 --> 00:16:18.336\nSo that's a quick way to set up\nparagraph styles, and then again,\n\n329\n00:16:18.336 --> 00:16:20.080\nI can continue to make changes.\n\n330\n00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.240\nI don't like the signs,\n\n331\n00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.760\ngreat, I'll shrink that down and\nthen I can tell it redefine style.\n\n332\n00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.370\nAnd it changes, but you notice\nthe headline and author didn't change,\n\n333\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.560\ncuz I already had it override on those for\nthe size, they're already different sizes.\n\n334\n00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.880\nSo when I change the body text size,\nthat didn't change, change with it.\n\n335\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.370\nSo I can go ahead and do some character\nstyles and then we'll go back and\n\n336\n00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:45.290\ntalk about what this next style was.\n\n337\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.320\nLet's get zoomed in here.\n\n338\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.670\nThis is great if we have this ready to go,\nbut\n\n339\n00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:56.630\nsometimes I want some things in italic,\nchanged body text.\n\n340\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.470\nI don't like the way it looks now,\nbecause we messed it up.\n\n341\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.930\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nput it back in Palatino.\n\n342\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.570\nAnd let's go ahead and keep this at auto.\n\n343\n00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.300\nSo, it looks a little better there.\n\n344\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.860\nAll right, we'll say great,\nthat's what that looks like.\n\n345\n00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.740\nThis is body text.\n\n346\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.170\nThe whole thing is body text.\n\n347\n00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.890\nI have no overrides whatsoever in here.\n\n348\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.550\nWe wanna make sure there's no little plus,\nno overrides.\n\n349\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.050\nIt looks good.\n\n350\n00:17:16.292 --> 00:17:19.160\nAll right so we have this text and\nI think okay, great,\n\n351\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.520\nI would like some things to be in italic.\n\n352\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.510\nWell, I don't wanna make\na whole other paragraph style,\n\n353\n00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.700\nbecause when I apply a paragraph style,\nit's going to add it to a whole paragraph.\n\n354\n00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.170\nThis is something where I might say\ncertain words need to be in italic.\n\n355\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.360\nSo there's some things I can do.\n\n356\n00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.140\nI can come in here and select a word.\n\n357\n00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.960\nAnd use my keyboard shortcut,\nshift command or\n\n358\n00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.750\nshift control i to italicize it, but\nas soon as I do that I get that override.\n\n359\n00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.460\nIt says, you've done an override.\n\n360\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.340\nWe don't wanna leave that, that's bad.\n\n361\n00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.480\nWell I don't wanna redefine that style I\njust wanted that one word to be italic or\n\n362\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.930\na few select ones.\n\n363\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.980\nI'm gonna undo that command or\ncontrol z to get rid of that.\n\n364\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.790\nSo a character style goes on top of it.\n\n365\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.550\nMy character styles are very simple.\n\n366\n00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:05.000\nThey might just be itallic, or\nbold, or green, or whatever it is,\n\n367\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.750\nor generally, I don't define fonts\nin my character styles either,\n\n368\n00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.570\nbecause if I define this character\nstyle as Palatino Bold, and\n\n369\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.170\nwe change the body text and\nall the other text to Trebuschet.\n\n370\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.250\nToday my italicised words will still be\nin Palatino and we don't want to do that.\n\n371\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.840\nWe just want to say,\nplus italic, on top of that.\n\n372\n00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.080\nSo, when I work with character styles\nI make sure nothing is selected.\n\n373\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.020\nI don't want any of that information\nbeing force fed into my style.\n\n374\n00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.040\nI'm just gonna go over\nthe the character style menu.\n\n375\n00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.850\nI'm sorry option or ALT click on\nthe little new icon at the bottom and\n\n376\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:45.700\ncall this italic, and right down here I\ncan see that it says style settings none.\n\n377\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.250\nI have absolutely nothing defined for\nthis style and that's what I want.\n\n378\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.960\nI'm gonna come here to basic character\nformatting and go to font style and\n\n379\n00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.110\ntype in italic.\n\n380\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.940\nI can also use the pull down menu but\nyou can see that there a lot of different\n\n381\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.280\nfaces available to you based on all\nthe fonts that you have listed.\n\n382\n00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.340\nSorry and\nI'm just gonna click keep that as italic.\n\n383\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.610\nI'm gonna add nothing else.\n\n384\n00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.750\nGo back to general and\nsee that it says none plus italic.\n\n385\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.460\nSo it's just italic on top of\nwhatever paragraph style we have.\n\n386\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.970\nRight so I'm gonna go ahead and say okay.\n\n387\n00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.390\nAnd now when I want that word\nto be in italic I select that.\n\n388\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.030\nI can see it's body text no plus.\n\n389\n00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.400\nThat's what we want.\n\n390\n00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.610\nAnd I come over here to italic and\njust say apply Italic that way.\n\n391\n00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.300\nSo that's what I wouldn't do.\n\n392\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.990\nEvery time I want an italicized word I\nselect the word or a whole bunch of texts.\n\n393\n00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.510\nWhatever it is I need and say italic.\n\n394\n00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.720\nWhen I use the character style.\n\n395\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.830\nI don't get that little plus and\nthat's exactly what I want.\n\n396\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:40.650\nAnd again if I decide italic also needs\nto have green at the last minute,\n\n397\n00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.660\nI've italicized all these words.\n\n398\n00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.780\nIf I did it manually,\nnot only would I have overrides,\n\n399\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.230\nbut I would have to fix them all manually.\n\n400\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.470\nAnd if we say, actually where we had that\nitalicized, could we make that green and\n\n401\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.440\nitalic?\n\n402\n00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.700\nSure, we can do that.\n\n403\n00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.370\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and double-click on\nItalic, make sure I have no text selected,\n\n404\n00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.100\nor hold down all my modifier keys,\nand come in here and actually say,\n\n405\n00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.560\nlet's change the character\ncolor to that green, that teal.\n\n406\n00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.560\nI might change the name.\n\n407\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.290\nI might call this italic green.\n\n408\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.190\nJust so it makes a little bit more sence,\nyou don't have to.\n\n409\n00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.640\nThen I'm going to say okay,\n\n410\n00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.480\nwhen I do that all the places that I had\nthat italicized, also shows up like that.\n\n411\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.020\nAll right, so\nthat's how we put that on top of it.\n\n412\n00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.430\nLets talk a little bit about Next.\n\n413\n00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.870\nOn also of the things that you\ncan do with imported texts,\n\n414\n00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.720\nI said to retain local overrides.\n\n415\n00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.520\nWhen we came from prior episode we\nbrought in some texts from word, and\n\n416\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.590\nit says retain local overrides, that\nmeans that if they manually italicized it\n\n417\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.880\nyou can use the fine change dialogue box\nto find out where something was manually\n\n418\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.660\nitalicized And\napply a character style to it.\n\n419\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.720\nSo that's something to explore\non your own, but just so\n\n420\n00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.410\nyou know that you can do that.\n\n421\n00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.030\nYou don't have to manually go back and\ndo all this.\n\n422\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.940\nAll right, let's talk about next, Style.\n\n423\n00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.040\nSo what I can do is I can say,\n\n424\n00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:57.020\nwhen I hit Return for from a Style,\nwill it switch to another Style?\n\n425\n00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.680\nFor instance I have that Headline.\n\n426\n00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.080\nWhen I hit return, I would like it to\nsay the author name and switch to it.\n\n427\n00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.560\nThen when I hit return from that,\nI would like it to be body text.\n\n428\n00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.270\nSo I can set all that up inside my styles.\n\n429\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.300\nI'm going to start with the first one and\nwhat I call a rotation,\n\n430\n00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.590\nbecause headline is the first one\nI'm going to type in my situation.\n\n431\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.460\nI'm going to hold down my modifier\nkeys and double-click on headline, and\n\n432\n00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.780\nI'm going to tell it next style is author.\n\n433\n00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.350\nSo I just tell it.\n\n434\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:27.140\nWhen I hit return, it switches for me,\nso I don't have to switch afterwards.\n\n435\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.210\nI'll say okay.\n\n436\n00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.090\nThen I'm going to go into author and\ndouble click on that, and\n\n437\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.540\ntell it next style is body text.\n\n438\n00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.710\nSo we'll say okay to that.\n\n439\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.320\nAnd then, on body text, I'm going to\nleave it, and it says, same style.\n\n440\n00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.630\nAnd that means when I hit return,\nit doesn't switch to a different style.\n\n441\n00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.590\nAnd for body text you often don't know\nhow many paragraphs you're going to have\n\n442\n00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:46.600\nof body style.\n\n443\n00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.180\nIf you were going to do this headline off\nthe body style and then you have three or\n\n444\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.810\neight paragraphs of body style, when\nit's time to switch to headline you just\n\n445\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.320\nmanually have to go switch it back to\nheadline, but I can say okay to that.\n\n446\n00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.780\nAnd now when I'm typing if I\nsay okay this is headline.\n\n447\n00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.210\nLet's make this headline.\n\n448\n00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.540\nAnd I hit return and I say, by author so\nthat's already built in there.\n\n449\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.960\nAnd then I hit return, it automatically\nswitches everything for me.\n\n450\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.120\nI'm actually gonna select all that now and\ngo back to basic paragraph.\n\n451\n00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.430\nAnd what that's gonna do is it's gonna\nstrip it down to what the built in\n\n452\n00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:26.970\ntext is for Enzyme, which is the 12 point,\nand so it stripped out every style.\n\n453\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.360\nI wanna make sure it says basic here,\nand it says none here.\n\n454\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.600\nI wanna make sure no\nstyling is applied at all.\n\n455\n00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.470\nThis is what happens if you bring in text\nand you've stripped out all the styles.\n\n456\n00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.335\nNow like I said, it might have been that\nthis was manually applied in italic.\n\n457\n00:22:39.335 --> 00:22:42.120\nLet;s actually come in here and\nmake it an Italic.\n\n458\n00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.090\nWe don't have an italic for minion pro so\n\n459\n00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.470\nif it was their manual I could do\na fine change on that to fix that.\n\n460\n00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.540\nBut what I want to do is I want to go\nahead and do the next style applied to it.\n\n461\n00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.640\nEven though the text is already here and\nit's already typed, so\n\n462\n00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.500\nyou have to take an extra step instead of\nme saying headline, and I hit return and\n\n463\n00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.410\nit switches to author I wanna take text\nthat's there and say now do all of that.\n\n464\n00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.070\nApply all those next styles.\n\n465\n00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:09.500\nSo what I need to do is I need to\nselect one rotation of that text.\n\n466\n00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:13.810\nSo what I mean by that is if this were,\nsay a directory, you had name, address and\n\n467\n00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:14.390\nphone number.\n\n468\n00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.320\nAnd each one's on its own line or\nits own paragraph and\n\n469\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.510\nI need to have a style applied to each.\n\n470\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.180\nI might have several of those in a row.\n\n471\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.860\nSo in this case, I'm just gonna grab this,\n\n472\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.670\nI copied it, Command or Ctrl-C, hit\nReturn, Command or Ctrl-V to paste that.\n\n473\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.440\nSo maybe you have something\nthat looks like that, right?\n\n474\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.940\nAnd you want to do the headline\nauthor text, headline author text.\n\n475\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.430\nWell what we can do is,\nwe need to grab One rotation.\n\n476\n00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.600\nUnfortunately we can't grab it all\nbecause otherwise it would just\n\n477\n00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.370\nformat all the rest of them as body text,\n\n478\n00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.310\ncuz body text doesn't know when\nto stop being body text, right?\n\n479\n00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.960\nSo I can select all this and\nagain I don't have to select everything,\n\n480\n00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.700\nit just has to be enough of the paragraph\nbut for me I tend to do that.\n\n481\n00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.490\nAnd I'm gonna go to the first of\nthe rotation which is headline.\n\n482\n00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.891\nAnd I'm going to right click or\nCTRL click on the word, headline,\n\n483\n00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:01.136\nand come down here and say,\napply headline, then next style.\n\n484\n00:24:01.136 --> 00:24:03.881\nSo what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nforce the author line to be next, and\n\n485\n00:24:03.881 --> 00:24:07.039\nthe body text to that, and whatever else\nis selected will continue to be body text.\n\n486\n00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:07.896\nText.\n\n487\n00:24:07.896 --> 00:24:09.400\nSo I say, OK, and that's fixed.\n\n488\n00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.825\nI can do the same thing\nwith the next rotation.\n\n489\n00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:14.230\nApply Headline, and then Next Style.\n\n490\n00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.360\nSo even though the text\ncame in afterwards,\n\n491\n00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.090\nyou can apply it that way as well.\n\n492\n00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.550\nSo whether or not you're entering it at\nthat time or you're bringing in plain\n\n493\n00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:25.680\ntext, you can use the Next Style to force\nit into whatever the next style should be.\n\n494\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.990\nYou might have something like headline,\nbyline,\n\n495\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:33.250\nfirst paragraph, and\nthen a regular body paragraph.\n\n496\n00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:36.230\nSo what I mean by fist paragraph, let's\ngo ahead and make one on this new page.\n\n497\n00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.500\nI'm still in the same document so\nI still have all the styles applied to me.\n\n498\n00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.890\nAnd, actually, let's make a couple\nother character styles as well.\n\n499\n00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.390\nI'm gonna do that first.\n\n500\n00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.840\nI have nothing selected, no text selected.\n\n501\n00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.770\nAnd I might have one that's called bold,\nobviously we're gonna do bold, italic.\n\n502\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.762\nEven though that one says italic green,\nwe'll just keep it as that and say OK.\n\n503\n00:24:54.762 --> 00:24:58.920\nAnd I said that I generally don't\nput in the font information.\n\n504\n00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.920\nSo when I'm in this bold, you notice\nit doesn't say what kind of font it is.\n\n505\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.522\nIf there is a font\nthat's already in there,\n\n506\n00:25:04.522 --> 00:25:07.641\nif you had something in there, you've\nselected something, delete it cuz, again,\n\n507\n00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:09.180\nI don't want font information in there.\n\n508\n00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.191\nBut, occasionally, I do, and\n\n509\n00:25:11.191 --> 00:25:15.990\nthe reason I might want it is maybe\nthe font is the exception to the rule.\n\n510\n00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.300\nSo I have one often\nthat's called dingbats.\n\n511\n00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.000\nSo I might have a paragraph that I want to\nhave a dingbat in there occasionally so\n\n512\n00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.190\nI need to be able to select it and\napply that.\n\n513\n00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.510\nSo this one might be Dingbats.\n\n514\n00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.580\nI think I have Dingbats on here.\n\n515\n00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.850\nI don't wanna actually base it on\nanything, so I had something selected.\n\n516\n00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.490\nI don't want anything in there.\n\n517\n00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.900\nAnd I might just come in here and do Zapf\nDingBats, that might be the thing, and\n\n518\n00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.310\nit might be a color, anything like that.\n\n519\n00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.450\nSo I have those, like I said,\nthey're pretty basic.\n\n520\n00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.560\nYou can only have one character\nstyle applied to text.\n\n521\n00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.530\nYou can't stack them on top of each other.\n\n522\n00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:52.607\nSo if I have one that's bold, sometimes I\nwant bold, and sometimes I want italic,\n\n523\n00:25:52.607 --> 00:25:54.950\nand sometimes I want bold-italic.\n\n524\n00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.790\nI have to make a third character\nstyle called bold-italic.\n\n525\n00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.400\nAnd if I want one that's bold-italic\nin red or one that's in green,\n\n526\n00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.500\nI gotta make a style for\neach one of those.\n\n527\n00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.220\nSomeday, hopefully, maybe we'll be able\nto stack character styles, but for\n\n528\n00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.180\nnow, we've never been able to do it.\n\n529\n00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.140\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n530\n00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.170\nKeep them simple so\n\n531\n00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:13.400\nthat they will change when we make\nupdates to the paragraph styles as well.\n\n532\n00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:19.030\nThe last thing in text styles I\nwanna show you is that Next Style.\n\n533\n00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:19.990\nNo, I did Next Style already.\n\n534\n00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.360\nI wanted to add a first paragraph style,\nsorry about that.\n\n535\n00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.940\nWe're gonna wedge one in between there.\n\n536\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.140\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nput some text in here.\n\n537\n00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.412\nNotice it's red because it's looking for\nmedium pro bold, which I don't have.\n\n538\n00:26:31.412 --> 00:26:34.990\nI wanna make sure nothing is selected\nhere, everything is zeroed out.\n\n539\n00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.830\nI've got no character style and\njust the basic paragraph style,\n\n540\n00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.060\nand I'm gonna tell it Body Text.\n\n541\n00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:45.484\nBut this body text is gonna\nlook a little different because\n\n542\n00:26:45.484 --> 00:26:51.582\nI want my first paragraph in my\ndocument to always have a drop cap.\n\n543\n00:26:51.582 --> 00:26:52.198\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n544\n00:26:52.198 --> 00:26:55.209\nI'm gonna select this and\nI'm gonna go ahead and Option or\n\n545\n00:26:55.209 --> 00:26:57.580\nAlt-click to create a new style.\n\n546\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.250\nWe'll call that first paragraph.\n\n547\n00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.723\nSo the first paragraph has a drop cap.\n\n548\n00:27:01.723 --> 00:27:04.460\nAnd I'm gonna come down to Drop Caps and\nNested Styles.\n\n549\n00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.090\nAnd I'm just gonna come in here and\nsay, I would like a drop cap.\n\n550\n00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.220\nAnd this looks just like we did when\nwe were working in the Character panel\n\n551\n00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.220\nto create a drop cap.\n\n552\n00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.230\nI'm gonna tell it I want it to be three\nlines, just the first character, but\n\n553\n00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.680\nI can also choose a character style for\nthat.\n\n554\n00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.390\nSo maybe it's the italic green.\n\n555\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.620\nSo it's gonna be in the same font,\nbut it'll be italic green.\n\n556\n00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.000\nIf I had a character style,\nI normally have one called drop caps, and\n\n557\n00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.070\nit's usually one of my scripty fonts, and\nit's bigger, and it's bold, or whatever.\n\n558\n00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.900\nSo I would put in whatever I need here.\n\n559\n00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.850\nYou can also create one on the fly,\nright here.\n\n560\n00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.490\nIf you say, I didn't make one for\ndrop caps, I can create one here.\n\n561\n00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.420\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and say that.\n\n562\n00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.510\nI can actually preview it and see that\nthat's what that's going to look like, and\n\n563\n00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.610\nI can make changes as I need from there,\nbut\n\n564\n00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.280\nthat's what my first paragraph looks like.\n\n565\n00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.080\nI can also do things like line styles.\n\n566\n00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.450\nThere's a lot to styles that we could\ntake hours and hours to talk about.\n\n567\n00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.960\nSo just be sure to explore and see what\nelse you can build into your style.\n\n568\n00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.480\nAnything that you're doing\nto your paragraphs or\n\n569\n00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.200\nyour characters, make sure that you build\nthose into a style because you wanna\n\n570\n00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.110\nbe able to do those and\nrecreate that again and again.\n\n571\n00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.117\nThe last thing I will do with the styles,\nthough, is I wanna make sure that this\n\n572\n00:28:09.117 --> 00:28:13.000\nfirst paragraph gets wedged into that\nnext style rotation that we have.\n\n573\n00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.810\nSo I wanna make sure that after author,\nwe actually go,\n\n574\n00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.976\ninstead of to body text,\nwe go to first paragraph.\n\n575\n00:28:19.976 --> 00:28:21.310\nAnd then in the first paragraph,\n\n576\n00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:24.810\nI wanna make sure that\nthe next style is body text.\n\n577\n00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.430\nSo we say, OK, we'll come back over here,\n\n578\n00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.240\nand I'm gonna zap this back\nout to basic paragraph.\n\n579\n00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.841\nNow I have to make sure that I\nhave some more text down here.\n\n580\n00:28:34.965 --> 00:28:37.660\nSo now I have that, do the same thing.\n\n581\n00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.140\nI will say to apply Headline,\nand then Next Style.\n\n582\n00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.384\nWhen I do that now I have that drop cap.\n\n583\n00:28:44.384 --> 00:28:47.270\nNow the drop cap doesn't look great\nbecause I have a three line drop cap and\n\n584\n00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.940\nI had very little text, but\nthat is the first paragraph and\n\n585\n00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.250\nthat's what the rest of\nthe paragraphs look like from there.\n\n586\n00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.060\nSo it's easy to rerun that.\n\n587\n00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.670\nUsually, I just zap it out with basic\nparagraph cuz that gets rid of all\n\n588\n00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.558\nthe styling, and\nthen apply the new styling on top of it.\n\n589\n00:28:59.558 --> 00:29:03.890\nThat's text styles in a nutshell,\na very small nutshell, there's so\n\n590\n00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:04.500\nmuch you can do.\n\n591\n00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.390\nLike I said, any time you add any styling,\ngo ahead and put it into a paragraph style\n\n592\n00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.430\nor a character style so\nyou can use it over and over again.\n\n593\n00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:15.330\nAnd the other thing that we can do is\nthat we can do the same thing to objects,\n\n594\n00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.400\nwe have object styles.\n\n595\n00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.440\nSo let me show object styles\nreally super quickly.\n\n596\n00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.080\nSo same concept, create something,\nand then create a style for it.\n\n597\n00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.300\nLet me close up these items.\n\n598\n00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.884\nI'm gonna reset my workspace.\n\n599\n00:29:27.884 --> 00:29:32.530\nI'm gonna go back to Styles,\nit's under Window, down under Styles and\n\n600\n00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.690\nchoose Object Styles.\n\n601\n00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:39.480\nAnd it's a lot of the same concept, create\nsomething, create a style based on that.\n\n602\n00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.170\nBut there are two different styles\nthat we can look at in object styles,\n\n603\n00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.660\nwe have a Graphics Frame and a Text Frame.\n\n604\n00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.855\nSo think about if you wanted,\nlet's say, a graphics frame,\n\n605\n00:29:48.855 --> 00:29:51.695\nit was like that rectangular\nwe did with a drop shadow.\n\n606\n00:29:51.695 --> 00:29:55.080\nWe wanna use that a lot, or maybe it's\na picture frame with a drop shadow.\n\n607\n00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.380\nSo let's set that up.\n\n608\n00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.220\nWe can draw this out, we think,\nokay, this is a picture frame.\n\n609\n00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.100\nNow it's not keeping\ntrack of what size it is.\n\n610\n00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.650\nIt's not like a library item where\nit's gonna draw the same thing.\n\n611\n00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:05.950\nIt's just saying what are the attributes.\n\n612\n00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.310\nWell, we have a stroke of,\nlet's actually make this stroke.\n\n613\n00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.660\nI want to make this stroke a color and\nwe'll just choose one from our swatches.\n\n614\n00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.590\nAnd we'll come in here and\nwe'll grab this dark green, and\n\n615\n00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.670\nI'm gonna make it a thick stroke.\n\n616\n00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:24.510\nAnd let's go ahead and\nadd a drop shadow to it.\n\n617\n00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.490\nI'm just gonna use\nwhatever's basic in here.\n\n618\n00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.870\nWe're gonna say, okay, and I actually\nwant the fill to be white just for now so\n\n619\n00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.830\nI don't see that drop shadow coming\nthrough the frame that's there.\n\n620\n00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.010\nSo let's make the fill just paper or\nwhite.\n\n621\n00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.940\nBut maybe we're gonna\nput images in it anyway,\n\n622\n00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.060\nwe wouldn't have seen the drop shadow.\n\n623\n00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.690\nBut I will say, okay, that's what I want\non my picture frames or my boxes for\n\n624\n00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.720\nanything, whether or\nnot I'm putting an image in it or\n\n625\n00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.250\nit's just sitting there\nwith some text in it.\n\n626\n00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.670\nI want my frame to look like that.\n\n627\n00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.950\nNow you notice the graphics frame\nover here suddenly has a plus\n\n628\n00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:57.330\nbecause it went from the basic and\nI added this overriding stuff.\n\n629\n00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:02.030\nSo I'm gonna Option or Alt-click on New,\nand we'll call it Shadow Frame.\n\n630\n00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.280\nMaybe I'll call it Shadow Frame Green.\n\n631\n00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.940\nI always try to put in there\nwhat it is that goes in there.\n\n632\n00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.780\nNow the basic attributes, by default,\neverything is set to be on except for\n\n633\n00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:13.920\nParagraph Styles.\n\n634\n00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.950\nAnd this isn't a text frame, so\nit won't actually apply to this at all.\n\n635\n00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.674\nSo we'll do that in the next example.\n\n636\n00:31:19.674 --> 00:31:24.294\nSo right now, it says everything\nthat's in that item that I just\n\n637\n00:31:24.294 --> 00:31:28.936\nhave selected is being force fed\ninto this particular setting.\n\n638\n00:31:28.936 --> 00:31:29.910\nIn fact, there are so\n\n639\n00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.590\nmany settings we have to drill\ndown on each of those to see.\n\n640\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.290\nBut basically, I create one and say, make\na new one and everything that's there,\n\n641\n00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.900\nanything that I've styled is there and\nis part of that option.\n\n642\n00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.030\nNow, with the Paragraph Styles,\nif you notice there's a little slash.\n\n643\n00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:47.780\nYou can either have them on or\nnot important.\n\n644\n00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.700\nSo that just basically says,\nif I put a paragraph style in there and\n\n645\n00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.360\nit's different from what you're expecting,\ndon't flag that as an override,\n\n646\n00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.380\nthat's what that slash means.\n\n647\n00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.045\nBut we don't have Paragraph Style\ncuz this is not a text frame,\n\n648\n00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:01.112\nit's a graphics frame.\n\n649\n00:32:01.112 --> 00:32:02.043\nSo, I'll just say OK to that.\n\n650\n00:32:02.043 --> 00:32:04.653\nThat's a shadow frame, and then I\nwanna make sure I actually apply that.\n\n651\n00:32:04.653 --> 00:32:07.176\nSo I'll select it and apply that and\nsay, great, that's a shadow frame.\n\n652\n00:32:07.176 --> 00:32:09.147\nWhoops, why did it do that?\n\n653\n00:32:09.147 --> 00:32:12.472\nLet me select this and\nmake the new shadow frame.\n\n654\n00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:17.390\nLet's do that, and say that's what the\nshadow frame needed to look like, or not.\n\n655\n00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:18.470\nIt's not going to let me do that.\n\n656\n00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.190\nI'm going to copy that and then paste\nthat, and say okay here's what I want.\n\n657\n00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.970\nI want a new one,\nwe are just going to do the same thing.\n\n658\n00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:29.876\nOption, alt click, and\nsay let's do green shadow frame,\n\n659\n00:32:29.876 --> 00:32:33.530\nand apply that to the selection.\n\n660\n00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.220\nSo now I have that frame set up and\n\n661\n00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:41.270\nI want to grab this little item that's\nhere, this little proxy and drag it down.\n\n662\n00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.510\nAnd say for all new shadow frames,\nor I'm sorry, for all new graphic\n\n663\n00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.800\nframes that is the default for\nthat, if that makes sense.\n\n664\n00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.425\nSo otherwise,\nit's always going to draw this other one.\n\n665\n00:32:52.425 --> 00:32:55.027\nSo now every time I draw\nout a new frame like that,\n\n666\n00:32:55.027 --> 00:32:57.263\nit automatically has that applied to it.\n\n667\n00:32:57.263 --> 00:32:59.664\nAnd now I have an override on it,\nsometimes this happens,\n\n668\n00:32:59.664 --> 00:33:02.907\nit's like it should grab what was there\nbut it's grabbing some information.\n\n669\n00:33:02.907 --> 00:33:04.936\nAutomatically did an override,\nI didn't do that,\n\n670\n00:33:04.936 --> 00:33:07.180\nit's just grabbing\ninformation from somewhere.\n\n671\n00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.320\nRemember to option or\nalt click on that name and\n\n672\n00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:15.160\nit gets rid of that override and makes\nit adhere to that standard that we have.\n\n673\n00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.330\nSo that's a graphics frame.\n\n674\n00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.530\nWe can do the same thing for a text frame.\n\n675\n00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.930\nSo if you know you constantly\nwant a three-column text frame,\n\n676\n00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:23.100\nwe can do the same thing.\n\n677\n00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.970\nSo I can draw the text frame,\nopen to the object menu,\n\n678\n00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.540\nand come down to text frame options.\n\n679\n00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.260\nAnd tell it,\nlet's say it's three columns, and\n\n680\n00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.150\nwe put a gutter in there, and\nwe say okay, because every\n\n681\n00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.810\ntime I draw a new text frame I don't want\nto have to go into text frame options.\n\n682\n00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:41.290\nI can select this, do the option or alt,\nwe'll call this a three column frame,\n\n683\n00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:47.700\nand here's where I can say yes, and\nthe paragraph style is also important.\n\n684\n00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.732\nSo like you are doing say a side bar you\ncan set it up not only the way the border\n\n685\n00:33:51.732 --> 00:33:54.730\nlooks and the fields looks,\nyou can also and always\n\n686\n00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:58.340\nfill it with your paragraph style called\nsidebar text or whatever you've call it.\n\n687\n00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.970\nSo you need to select on this,\nactually click on this, and\n\n688\n00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.920\nsay what text need to go in there.\n\n689\n00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.960\nSo in this case let's in this\nwe always put body text, and\n\n690\n00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.630\ndo we include the next style as well?\n\n691\n00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.630\nIf that's part of that rotation,\nyou might wanna include that as well.\n\n692\n00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.320\nSo now I say OK.\n\n693\n00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.660\nAnd that's this three column frame,\nand I want that to be the default, so\n\n694\n00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.880\nI drag that down.\n\n695\n00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:23.340\nNow every time I draw out a new text frame\nin this document, it's automatically\n\n696\n00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:27.000\nthree columns, and when I fill a\nplaceholder text, it's also automatically\n\n697\n00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.770\nfilled with our body text that's in\nthat particular document that's there.\n\n698\n00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.390\nSo anytime we do the same thing over and\n\n699\n00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:36.120\nover again,\nwe want to make a styles for it.\n\n700\n00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.090\nThere are also sale styles and\ntable styles as well.\n\n701\n00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.730\nSo basically anything you do over and\nover and over again or\n\n702\n00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:45.280\nyou want consistency, make a style for it\nso that you don't have to think about it.\n\n703\n00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.340\nWe just draw it, it works,for this, I've\nsuddenly got a three-column text frame.\n\n704\n00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.350\nAnd I've got that paragraph\nstyle already assigned.\n\n705\n00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.800\nI don't even have to think anything\nabout it, I'm just ready to get up and\n\n706\n00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.380\nstart putting the text in there.\n\n707\n00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.410\n>> Erica, that's nice.\n\n708\n00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.430\nThe styles just definitely seems like\nit can save you a lot of time and\n\n709\n00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.990\na lot of headache and\nreally help that project just go smoothly.\n\n710\n00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.240\nDoes look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode,\n\n711\n00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.460\nbut before we sign out this episode,\ndo you have any additional words or\n\n712\n00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.270\nadvice you'd like to give on styles?\n\n713\n00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.125\n>> Yes, use them.\n\n714\n00:35:12.125 --> 00:35:13.270\n[LAUGH] That's it.\n\n715\n00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.610\n>> Very good, that's great.\n\n716\n00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.220\nWell, thank you for joining us here in\nthe studios and the wealth of knowledge on\n\n717\n00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.790\nstyles, and thank you to you,\nthe viewer, for watching.\n\n718\n00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.290\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your

00:00:15.637\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:15.637 --> 00:00:16.703\nIn today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:20.130\nwe are coming back at you with more\nof the Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n6\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.810\nThat's right,\nback again with more InDesign.\n\n7\n00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.630\nJoining me in the studio is Erica Gammet.\n\n8\n00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.425\nErica how ya doing?\n\n9\n00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.111\n>> Fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:26.670\n>> All right, so\n\n11\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.430\nwe've been travelling along this\njourney that is known as InDesign.\n\n12\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.800\nWhere are we going next?\n\n13\n00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.580\n>> We're gonna start prepping for output.\n\n14\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.420\n>> All right, very good.\n\n15\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.250\n>> So, we're gonna jump in and\n\n16\n00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.870\nwe're gonna start talking about\nsome issues we might have.\n\n17\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.890\nAnd start thinking about how\nwe're going to output this\n\n18\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.080\npiece that we've been creating,\nwhether that's to print or digital.\n\n19\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.560\nSo we need to start making\nsome more considerations and\n\n20\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.150\nstart making sure that the work we've\nput into it actually is going give us\n\n21\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.260\nthe results that we're\nexpecting in the end.\n\n22\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.200\nSo, the first thing I'm going\nto talk about is transparency.\n\n23\n00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.780\nSo I'm going to look at a couple\nitems that I have on my page\n\n24\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.330\nthat are transparent.\n\n25\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.610\nSo I've just got some simple\nshapes here right now.\n\n26\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.000\nAnd transparency is something\nwe've been adding as we go along.\n\n27\n00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.990\nThrough all the episodes, we've added\nthings like drop shadows and effects,\n\n28\n00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.700\nfeathers.\n\n29\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.540\nIn this case,\nI have two objects overlapped.\n\n30\n00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.460\nI have done things like clipping paths,\nso that we can add a drop shadow.\n\n31\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.560\nAnd while point of that is so\n\n32\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.350\nthat we can do things like put this on\ntop of this text, and it looks like\n\n33\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.970\na drop shadow hanging on top of some\ntext and over this shape here, as well.\n\n34\n00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.920\nAnd all of that is well and\ngood if we're going to digital.\n\n35\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.156\nBecause, and\neven then we can run into some issues.\n\n36\n00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:36.640\nBut for printing,\nlet's take that into consideration first.\n\n37\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.260\nBecause what happens is, when we're\nworking with these transparent objects or\n\n38\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.960\neffects, is we're working with light.\n\n39\n00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.070\nSo we've got objects that are shining\nthrough other objects, right?\n\n40\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.870\nSo in this case, I've got this bluish\nsquare on this yellow square and\n\n41\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.550\nwhere they overlap is some form of green\nor brown, or depending your monitor.\n\n42\n00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.970\nSo, but it's a different color,\nwe can see that.\n\n43\n00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.020\nWell what happens is, if we were going\nto print this, whether it's digitally,\n\n44\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.180\nwe're going to print to toner,\n\n45\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.670\nwe're going to print it on the printing\npress with ink, it doesn't matter.\n\n46\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.760\nWhat happens though when we go to print,\nwe have to fake that transparency.\n\n47\n00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.090\nSo basically,\nyou can't print in transparent ink.\n\n48\n00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.530\nNow there is transparent ink and\ntransparent,\n\n49\n00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.792\nyou know if you've ever\nworked on model planes,\n\n50\n00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:23.230\nyou know there's transparent paint,\nright, and it shows through.\n\n51\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.310\nBut when we're trying to do something\nlike this, I can't use transparent ink.\n\n52\n00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.860\nBecause here I need to be solid blue,\nand here a solid yellow, but\n\n53\n00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.780\nhere I need it to be transparent.\n\n54\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.380\nSo what happens when we go to print,\nwe have to fake it.\n\n55\n00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.570\nWe have to make it look transparent,\nand that's where issues can come in.\n\n56\n00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.850\nNow, year by year as we go along,\nthere are fewer and fewer issues, but\n\n57\n00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.870\nwe still be to be aware of them.\n\n58\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.990\nAnd one thing that I can do, is I can,\nin my pages panel, and we looked at this\n\n59\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.410\nin a prior episode, when we went ahead and\nworked with the pages panel, is one of\n\n60\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.170\nthe things I can tell it in the panel\noptions, is to show me my transparency.\n\n61\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.230\nSo, I'm gonna say OK, and when I do that,\n\n62\n00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.320\nI get these little checker boards next to\nit, telling me that there's transparency.\n\n63\n00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.980\nAnd it says, okay, I need to be aware that\nthere are transparent issues on this page.\n\n64\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.270\nThey may or may not be a problem,\nbut I need to keep an eye on it.\n\n65\n00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.730\nSo in this case,\nI have transparency on both pages.\n\n66\n00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.520\nI've got a drop shadow and\nI've got these items over lapped.\n\n67\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.780\nSo what happens when, or\nwhy is that a problem?\n\n68\n00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.190\nWell, we have to trick our eyes\ninto making it look transparent.\n\n69\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.650\nSo when I go to output whether\nI'm going to press and\n\n70\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.000\nI'm going to print it to a digital plate,\nor\n\n71\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.240\nI'm going to maybe just output it on\na laser printer, color laser printer.\n\n72\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.130\nI have to have a way for\nthe machine to know\n\n73\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.320\nthat this is not actually transparency,\nbut let's make it look transparent.\n\n74\n00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.870\nSo what happens, in a nutshell,\nis something called flattening.\n\n75\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.820\nSo right now we have all these layers, and\nthey work together well in this lighted\n\n76\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.730\nenvironment that we're working in\nto give you that transparency.\n\n77\n00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.150\nBut, I need to flatten it all down when it\ngoes to print because it's going to be one\n\n78\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.370\nsolid output.\n\n79\n00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.030\nSo I have to flatten it.\n\n80\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.370\nSo what happens in what's called a RIP,\na raster image processor, when we go to\n\n81\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.780\noutput it is that it says, okay, you've\ngot this blue square that's in here.\n\n82\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.770\nIf we can jump back to the screen.\n\n83\n00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.390\nWe've got this blue square and\nwe've got this yellow square, but\n\n84\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.290\nwe also have this third region.\n\n85\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.800\nThis green square,\nwhatever we want to call it.\n\n86\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.550\nThe machine, when it exports, whether\nit's us exporting it from InDesign and\n\n87\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.100\nthat engine is working on it or we send\nit to a RIP machine and that RIP machine,\n\n88\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.310\nthat software has to go, okay, how do I\nmake that look like a transparent square?\n\n89\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.770\nIt says, I'm gonna create these\nthings called atomic regions.\n\n90\n00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.900\nAnd so, there's the blue one, and the\nyellow one, and the one in the middle, so\n\n91\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.450\nit breaks it down.\n\n92\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.700\nThat's some place where a lot\nof the processors give up, and\n\n93\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.630\nthey say I can't figure\nout how to do that.\n\n94\n00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.690\nSame thing with the drop shadow.\n\n95\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.370\nShadow.\n\n96\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.990\nThe drop shadow says, you've got all these\ndifferent images, all these different\n\n97\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.750\nshades of black basically, to give it\nthe illusion of this transparency.\n\n98\n00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.480\nAnd then also,\nif you have information back behind it,\n\n99\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.690\nnow I have that added as well.\n\n100\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.480\nSo I've got all these different shades of\nyellow, all the different shades of gray\n\n101\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.950\nand I have to make each one it's\nown little separate region.\n\n102\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.310\nNow, why do I tell you that?\n\n103\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.830\nBecause sometimes what happens is like say\nthe machinary or the software gives up and\n\n104\n00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.600\nsays that is a beautiful\ndrop shadow that you have,\n\n105\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.300\nhere is a big black square instead.\n\n106\n00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.400\nBecause that's all it can\ndo at it that sometimes.\n\n107\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.030\nSo I'm just saying keep an eye on that and\nknow that that might be an issue.\n\n108\n00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.300\nGoing back to the very beginning where\nI said always know what happens to your\n\n109\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.819\npiece when it leaves,\nwhat happens when to it, do a test.\n\n110\n00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.556\nIf you think you're gonna run a bunch of\nstuff with drop-shadows and transparency,\n\n111\n00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:33.310\nrun a test.\n\n112\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.590\nExport it how the printer\nwants you to export it,\n\n113\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.820\nwhether that's a PDF with their settings.\n\n114\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.210\nYou send it to them and say okay, great.\n\n115\n00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.520\nCan you put it on a press and test it?\n\n116\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.300\nIt out.\n\n117\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.420\nIt sounds expensive, but the great thing\nis if you're running it on a four color\n\n118\n00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.630\npress, they're usually on big sheets,\nthere's usually a section off to the side\n\n119\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.330\nthat they're just gonna cut away and\nthrow away anyway.\n\n120\n00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.370\nYou can often throw that\non there as a separate job.\n\n121\n00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.580\nAnd just put it on there and\nmake sure, hey, does that look right?\n\n122\n00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.200\nAnd make sure that it gives you\nthe results you're going to give.\n\n123\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.330\nSo a lot of thing I know is technical.\n\n124\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.510\nAnd if you're not printing you might\nthink, I don't need to worry about this.\n\n125\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.330\nBut when we export to PDF\nin an upcoming episode,\n\n126\n00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.865\nwe're gonna see that transparency is\nstill a thing, just not as big a deal.\n\n127\n00:06:11.865 --> 00:06:15.240\n[LAUGH] So there's some ways to\ntest where you might have problems.\n\n128\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.770\nInstead of trying to remember\nwhere your transparency is or\n\n129\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.960\njust relying on the little icon\nthat's here next to the pages,\n\n130\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.370\nis that we can go ahead and\nlook at that in an output preview mode.\n\n131\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.850\nSo right now, what we're working in\nis just sort of the normal art mode.\n\n132\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.570\nAnd I can choose Overprint Preview.\n\n133\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.420\nI'm actually go down and look at\nthose squares of color that we have.\n\n134\n00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.210\nI'm gonna turn on Overprint Preview.\n\n135\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.150\nLet's move this out of the way so\nwe can actually see the change happen.\n\n136\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.810\nSo watch the squares that are there,\nand so Overprint Preview.\n\n137\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.000\nNow it changed a little bit.\n\n138\n00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.900\nYou notice the blue got\na little bit darker.\n\n139\n00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.680\nNot a whole lot, sometimes you'll\nsee a huge shift of colors.\n\n140\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.695\nAnd it just depends on your monitor and\nthe shapes that I have set up, but\n\n141\n00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:55.025\nI can see that it might\nlook a little different.\n\n142\n00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:58.075\nIf I had a different color background for\ninstance, that paper.\n\n143\n00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:00.955\nIn an earlier episode,\n\n144\n00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:04.870\nwe changed the swatches,\nthe paper swatches to something else.\n\n145\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.900\nI said, okay let's put paper and\nlet's give it just a slight blue tint.\n\n146\n00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.630\nJust a slight,\n\n147\n00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.760\nslight blue tint because that's\nthe paper that we're gonna print on.\n\n148\n00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.070\nYou think okay, that looks good.\n\n149\n00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.230\nWell let's actually turn\non Overprint Preview.\n\n150\n00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.260\nIt got really dark.\n\n151\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.220\nThat yellow got super muddy.\n\n152\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.630\nBecause that yellow of the shape and\n\n153\n00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.190\nthe blue of the paper combine to\nmake this sort of muddy green color.\n\n154\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.700\nAnd that's exactly what will happen\nwhen you print that in the real world.\n\n155\n00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.930\nSo again, turning on the Overprint\nPreview, while not super, super accurate,\n\n156\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.388\nit will show you, hm, that's not quite\nthe look that I wanted to go for.\n\n157\n00:07:37.388 --> 00:07:41.290\nSo that's Overprint Preview,\nyou can turn that on and check that out.\n\n158\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.890\nSo what happens?\n\n159\n00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.140\nHow do we fix some of these things?\n\n160\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.170\nLike this cactus bloom words.\n\n161\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.900\nWell, if text is back behind\na transparent object,\n\n162\n00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.800\none of the things that might happen is how\nit breaks it into those atomic regions.\n\n163\n00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.510\nSo for instance, when it comes to text,\nit might say, okay, this U over here or\n\n164\n00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.790\nmaybe even the L from\nthe L onward is text.\n\n165\n00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.030\nSo I'm gonna render that as actual text,\nactual font.\n\n166\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.680\nBut this part of the B, this top part\nof the B where it has transparency,\n\n167\n00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.170\nI'm gonna render that as raster image.\n\n168\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.350\nAnd I'm gonna render the bottom\npart as vector image.\n\n169\n00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.205\nAnd it's able to do that.\n\n170\n00:08:21.205 --> 00:08:26.532\nSo it will chop up your word into these\nlittle pieces which sounds terrible,\n\n171\n00:08:26.532 --> 00:08:27.540\nand it can be.\n\n172\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.334\nBecause what'll happen is\nwhere it's rasterized,\n\n173\n00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:33.430\nit might get just slightly fatter,\nslightly fuzzier.\n\n174\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.150\nNot a whole lot, but when you're\nlooking at letters especially, you're\n\n175\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.790\ngonna say that doesn't look right, what's\nwrong with the top of the B, it's weird.\n\n176\n00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.170\nSo it breaks it down into\nthese little regions.\n\n177\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.380\nSo keep in mind that that\nmight happen as well.\n\n178\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.120\nIn a second, we're gonna look how to\nvisualize where issues might come up.\n\n179\n00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.290\nBut how can we fix that?\n\n180\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:54.210\nWell, one thing is we can move this in\nthe layers panel or in the stacking order.\n\n181\n00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:58.380\nWe can move this word,\ncactus bloom up above that photo.\n\n182\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.301\nThat will fix our transparency problem.\n\n183\n00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.250\nBut now it doesn't look like\nwe wanted it to, right.\n\n184\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.220\nThe whole point was to have this\nnice shadow overlaying the text.\n\n185\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.700\nSo just keep in mind if that's a problem,\nthat might be your only option to do that.\n\n186\n00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.600\nThe other thing you can do is\nyou can take this text and\n\n187\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.190\nyou can convert it to outlines.\n\n188\n00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.750\nSo if you go up under type and\n\n189\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.920\ncome down to create outlines,\nnow that text is no longer text.\n\n190\n00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.960\nIt is actually vector image.\n\n191\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.990\nYou still might have a problem\ncuz it's still vector, and\n\n192\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.550\nit might rasterize part of it.\n\n193\n00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.910\nBut you're gonna cut out a lot\nof issues that way as well.\n\n194\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.610\nSo just a lot of different\nthings to keep in mind.\n\n195\n00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.720\nAgain, this is mostly for printing.\n\n196\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.510\nAlthough you will see sometimes\njust weird, chunky drop shadows or\n\n197\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.175\nchunky boxes where drop shadows should\nbe when you go to a PDF as well.\n\n198\n00:09:45.175 --> 00:09:46.415\nSo, another place to look at that as well,\n\n199\n00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:48.245\nI'm gonna actually make\nsure I'm backed up here.\n\n200\n00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:50.145\nI actually want this to be text,\n\n201\n00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:53.225\nbecause I want to see where\nI might be having problems.\n\n202\n00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:55.915\nSo, there's a couple output\npanels that you can look at\n\n203\n00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:59.260\nto kinda get an idea of\nwhere you might have issues.\n\n204\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.740\nSo one of them is called the flattener.\n\n205\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.700\nSo going way back to the very beginning\nwhen we first set up a new document,\n\n206\n00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.350\nwe told it what our intent was, right?\n\n207\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.290\nWe said, Cmd or Ctrl+N,\nnew document our intent is print and\n\n208\n00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.920\nit say's you are going to CMYK.\n\n209\n00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.710\nSo as we chose colors,\nit kept trying to steer us toward CMYK.\n\n210\n00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:26.430\nSo, if I go up under the Edit menu and\ncome down to the Transparency Blend Space,\n\n211\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.940\nit says that it is set for Document CMYK.\n\n212\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.700\nSo it automatically knows\nthat's where it's going.\n\n213\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.675\nSo it's going to give you clues\nas to where you might have\n\n214\n00:10:36.675 --> 00:10:38.881\ntrouble outputting the CMYK.\n\n215\n00:10:38.881 --> 00:10:42.020\nSo let's go ahead and\nopen up our flattener panel.\n\n216\n00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.890\nSo the flattener, again,\nis just saying okay,\n\n217\n00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.220\nwhen I go to output this,\nat some point I have to flatten it.\n\n218\n00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.390\nAnd when we export the PDF in\na future episode, we'll see that\n\n219\n00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.760\nwe can choose to do it when we make\nthe PDF or it might be that the PDF,\n\n220\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.320\nwhoever's outputting the PDF for print\nmight actually be flattening it as well.\n\n221\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.010\nLet's open up one of our panels.\n\n222\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:01.830\nUnder the window menu,\n\n223\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.560\nwe have a whole bunch here under output\nand the flattener preview is one of them.\n\n224\n00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.990\nAnd by default, nothing is highlighted.\n\n225\n00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.230\nNow this doesn't mean,\nwhen we look at this,\n\n226\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:16.220\nit doesn't say this will be a problem\nIt says this could be a problem.\n\n227\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.130\nSo let's open that.\n\n228\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.730\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust choose them from the pull-down menu.\n\n229\n00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.480\nAnd I can go ahead and look at each\nindividual item that we might have\n\n230\n00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.650\nproblems with,\nlike where might I see outlined text?\n\n231\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.490\nLet's choose that and\nit automatically highlights that.\n\n232\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.010\nNow, it doesn't mean that it would\nhappen necessarily, or even if it did,\n\n233\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.930\nthat it would happen in this nice square.\n\n234\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.660\nIt's basically where the flower hits and\noverlaps.\n\n235\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:44.320\nCuz remember, everything lives in\nrectangular bounding boxes, including\n\n236\n00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.690\nthose atomic regions where it picks and\nchooses what needs to be rasterized.\n\n237\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.000\nSo it's just saying that this bit of\nthe text might end up rasterized.\n\n238\n00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.680\nWell, if it does that, that little bit\nmight be fuzzy, or just slightly bolder.\n\n239\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.820\nAnd we don't want that,\nbecause that could be an issue.\n\n240\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.650\nSo how do we fix that?\n\n241\n00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.670\nWe say, okay,\nmaybe we bring this to the front.\n\n242\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.930\nGoing to right-click or\nCtrl-click on it, and say, Arrange, and\n\n243\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.400\nbring that to the front.\n\n244\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.780\nWhen I do that, you notice,\nthe red regions went away.\n\n245\n00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.440\nBecause it says, now, not an issue.\n\n246\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.970\nAgain, it's not exactly what we want\nthough, we wanted it back behind.\n\n247\n00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.700\nSo let's go ahead and refresh that and\nsee where we might have trouble.\n\n248\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.950\nWe can also turn on all\nrasterized regions, and\n\n249\n00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.750\nit will show you everything that's\ngoing to be rasterized in that image.\n\n250\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.340\nSo, you can see, obviously,\nthe image is going to rasterized, and\n\n251\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.750\nthe drop shadow is going to rasterized,\nand those are raster effects.\n\n252\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.720\nBut also where it overlaps\ncould be a problem as well.\n\n253\n00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.910\nAnd again, we don't know that\nthis is actually going to happen.\n\n254\n00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.250\nThis is just what we think might happen.\n\n255\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.570\nAnd you've got some presets here.\n\n256\n00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.280\nThese are your flattener presets.\n\n257\n00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.750\nSo, by default, you've got three of them,\nlow medium, and high.\n\n258\n00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:52.043\nSo when you go to Export or when you go to\nPrint from a document, and we're saying\n\n259\n00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:56.943\nprinting to our laser jet in the office,\nwe might use medium resolution.\n\n260\n00:12:56.943 --> 00:13:00.546\nBecause we're just telling it, it needs to\nflatten it and give us sorta the effect,\n\n261\n00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:03.050\nand I need to kinda see\nwhere my drop shadows are.\n\n262\n00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.690\nBut I'm not gonna tell it high resolution,\n\n263\n00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.560\nit's not going to send all that\ninformation to the printer because\n\n264\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.980\nthe laser jet can't actually\nhandle high resolution anyway.\n\n265\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.480\nSo, but\n\n266\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.240\nwhen I go to print, if I'm doing my final\npiece, I need to say high resolution.\n\n267\n00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.080\nNow, if we're sending\nout this file as a PDF,\n\n268\n00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.380\nthis will also be an option\nwhen we go to export to PDF.\n\n269\n00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.435\nI have a couple other here that are called\nhigh with outlines, and high with text and\n\n270\n00:13:27.435 --> 00:13:28.625\nstrokes outlined.\n\n271\n00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:33.985\nMeaning that I set this up to say\nthat anytime there's high resolution,\n\n272\n00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:38.605\nI also would like you to change\nall of the text to outlines.\n\n273\n00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:42.635\nSo instead of me selecting the text\nlike I did and say convert to outlines,\n\n274\n00:13:42.635 --> 00:13:45.950\nsort of kind of minimize some\nof those transparency issues,\n\n275\n00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.205\nI can tell it to do that on the fly\nwhen I send this out to a PDF.\n\n276\n00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:53.821\nAnd the great thing about that is that\nmy text is still editable text here in\n\n277\n00:13:53.821 --> 00:13:57.990\nInDesign, but the stuff that went\ninto the PDF is no longer text and\n\n278\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.330\nmay get rid of some of\nthose transparency issues.\n\n279\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.030\nSo I know it's a lot to\ntake in transparency, but\n\n280\n00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.300\nfor me, generally I look at it and then if\nI am running a test, I know where to look.\n\n281\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.080\nI don't have to look\nthrough my whole document.\n\n282\n00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.210\nIf I only have transparency on two pages,\nyou know there’s 20 other pages in\n\n283\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.370\nthere that don't have transparency I know\nI only need to concentrate on those two.\n\n284\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.230\nSo it just saves a lot of\ntime to be able to do that.\n\n285\n00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.530\nAnd you're going to learn.\n\n286\n00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.624\nIf it's the first time you've\nsent something to a printer,\n\n287\n00:14:23.624 --> 00:14:24.781\nyou're gonna have to test a lot.\n\n288\n00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:25.815\nBut once you've done it,\n\n289\n00:14:25.815 --> 00:14:29.130\nyou're probably fine knowing,\nthe drop shadows worked last time.\n\n290\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.455\nMy PDF could handle it, their software\ncould handle it, we're all good on that.\n\n291\n00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:37.130\nAnd the last thing in\nthe previews is separation.\n\n292\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:42.141\nSo if you are going to print and you're\ngoing to actually print it on an offset\n\n293\n00:14:42.141 --> 00:14:46.761\npress where you need to separate your\nitem out on two separate plates,\n\n294\n00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:49.689\nwe wanna check how those separations look.\n\n295\n00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:53.520\nWe wanna make sure that each color that\nI need is actually on its own plate.\n\n296\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.800\nNow in this case, I'm gonna zoom out\na little bit, this is a four color image.\n\n297\n00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.240\nSo that should separate in the CMYK, and I\nsaid way back earlier that in my swatches,\n\n298\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.010\nI don't have CMYK listed in my swatches.\n\n299\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.360\nBecause I never assigned Cyan, Magenta, or\n\n300\n00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.260\nYellow, individually to an object,\nbut I do have images that are CMYK.\n\n301\n00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.260\nAnd that's fine.\n\n302\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.080\nIt knows it.\n\n303\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.160\nIt's here and it says,\nthese are the colors that you have.\n\n304\n00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.570\nSo when I have a four color image,\nor a CMYK image, or\n\n305\n00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.030\neven in this case, it's an RGB image and\nit can actually change on the fly for us.\n\n306\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.830\nBut I'm gonna see how that\nseparates out when I print that.\n\n307\n00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.250\nAnd again, it knows we're going to print,\n\n308\n00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.410\ncuz we told that way back in\nthe beginning that our intent was print.\n\n309\n00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.710\nSo I can choose to view my separations.\n\n310\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.330\nI'm gonna choose separations.\n\n311\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.030\nAnd it shows all of them together.\n\n312\n00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.490\nI can turn of the CMYK right here\njust by clicking the little eyeball.\n\n313\n00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.663\nAnd it shows me the Pantone 266.\n\n314\n00:15:44.663 --> 00:15:47.900\nNow, you notice it showed me it in black.\n\n315\n00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.000\nThen I see as when I view individual\nplates, it shows it in black so\n\n316\n00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.500\nwe can actually see what\nis printing on that.\n\n317\n00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.810\nSo, in this case,\n\n318\n00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.830\nthe job that I'm printing would\nend up being a five color job.\n\n319\n00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.860\nWe've got cyan, magenta, yellow,\nblack, plus a Pantone on top of that.\n\n320\n00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.290\nIt's not a cheap job but, if those are our\ncolors, that's what we have to use.\n\n321\n00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.440\nRight, so I can go ahead and to that.\n\n322\n00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.130\nSo I can say okay, great,\nthat's what I wanted.\n\n323\n00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.860\nI wanted that to be a solid Pantone color.\n\n324\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.640\nI can then select another color and\ndeselect another eyeball.\n\n325\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.810\nSo I just turn on each one.\n\n326\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.920\nSo I can see okay,\nthat's printing in black, that's great.\n\n327\n00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.348\nThat's printing in yellow.\n\n328\n00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:25.010\nAnd notice when you add another one,\nit suddenly shows that in the colors,\n\n329\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.820\nwhich is kind of cool.\n\n330\n00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.060\nYou can actually build your file and\nsee how that's going to build together.\n\n331\n00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.870\nBut for me I want to make sure\nthat everything separated well.\n\n332\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.280\nI tend not to look at my\nCMYK separations so much.\n\n333\n00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.834\nBut what I usually wanna make sure is that\nmy Pantone color is exactly, everything\n\n334\n00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:45.524\nthat I want to be that Pantone color shows\non that Pantone color plate that's there.\n\n335\n00:16:45.524 --> 00:16:49.680\nThe other thing I could do\nis I can check my inclement.\n\n336\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.260\nAnd the inclement is just something that\nif you are setting it to an offset press,\n\n337\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.310\nyou need to discuss with your printer,\nhow much ink is too much ink?\n\n338\n00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.930\nSo think about if you had\nsomething that was 90% of cyan,\n\n339\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.840\nmagenta, yellow and 80% black,\nthat is a lot of ink.\n\n340\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.300\nThat's nearly 400% ink.\n\n341\n00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.090\nInk is actual stuff that\ngets put on the paper and\n\n342\n00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.140\nthe more you have the heavier and\nthe soggier that paper can become.\n\n343\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.799\nAnd that's a bad thing, right?\n\n344\n00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:16.910\nThat's gonna end up,\neverything is gonna look muddy.\n\n345\n00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.050\nSo most printers have a limit.\n\n346\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.590\nAnd 300 is just kind of one of\nthose magic numbers that may or\n\n347\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.370\nmay not actually be a real number.\n\n348\n00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.500\nBut 300 is just a good\nthing to think about.\n\n349\n00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.770\nSo I can say okay, my inclement is 300,\nso I want to go ahead and view that and\n\n350\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.360\nmake sure that I don't have too\nmuch of anything in this inclement.\n\n351\n00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.890\nSo I can come and here say,\nlet's say our inclement is only 280.\n\n352\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.120\nIf I do that actually, that's still good.\n\n353\n00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.800\nLet's say our increment is\n200 which is really low.\n\n354\n00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.280\nBut when I do that,\nyou get these red points and\n\n355\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.670\nit just says that's too much ink.\n\n356\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.240\nNow the solution to that is\nto go back into Photoshop and\n\n357\n00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.800\nactually make changes to that graphic.\n\n358\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.143\nSo unfortunately, that's your choice.\n\n359\n00:17:52.143 --> 00:17:56.437\n200's really low, but the great thing is\nif I say 300, nothing is tagged in red so\n\n360\n00:17:56.437 --> 00:17:57.900\nI'm pretty much ready to go.\n\n361\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.690\nI know that what I have is going to work.\n\n362\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.430\nIf I've worked with this printer\nbefore and I know they can handle that\n\n363\n00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.680\ntransparency, I can see where\nthe transparency issues were.\n\n364\n00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.180\nBut I'm gonna keep an eye on\nthat when we do a test run.\n\n365\n00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.940\nSo for me, I look at this before\nI send it out to a press.\n\n366\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.510\nI check the separations.\n\n367\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:18.180\nAnd I check the transparency\nflattener to make sure that I'm\n\n368\n00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.060\nnot going to have any issues\nwith my transparency.\n\n369\n00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.740\nSo again, think about this,\nthis is printing thing only pretty much.\n\n370\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.340\nLike I said were gonna look at it a little\nbit when we start talking about PDFs.\n\n371\n00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.960\nAnd other than that, just know that\nyou need to keep an eye on things and\n\n372\n00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.698\nhopefully everything will work out\nwhen we get it out to the press.\n\n373\n00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:38.960\n>> All right Erica, I know we're getting\none step closer to the final product here\n\n374\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.130\nbut it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n375\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:41.790\nBut before we do,\n\n376\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.330\ndo you have any additional words\nof wisdom on prepping the output?\n\n377\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.090\n>> Not yet.\n\n378\n00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.378\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, very good.\n\n379\n00:18:47.378 --> 00:18:49.856\nWe appreciate you being here and\nwe appreciate you the viewer

00:00:15.995\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:20.239\nin today's episode we're coming back at\nyou with more Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.050\nThat's right, back again for\nmore in design.\n\n6\n00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.870\nJoining me in the studios\ntoday is Erica Gamet.\n\n7\n00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.678\nErica how are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:26.455\n>> I'm doing great thanks.\n\n9\n00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:27.023\n>> Great, so\n\n10\n00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:31.170\nwe've been going through the journey I\nshould say that is known as InDesign.\n\n11\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.117\nWhat is our next stop?\n\n12\n00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:32.930\n>> We're gonna do some printing.\n\n13\n00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.188\n>> All right, very good.\n\n14\n00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:38.528\n>> All right, so whether you're printing\nto your desktop printer or you're working\n\n15\n00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:42.125\nin a print press environment and\nyou need to print actually out to your\n\n16\n00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:46.670\nrip devise you're going to encounter the\nsame dialogue box, the print dialogue box.\n\n17\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.256\nPretty much everybody's familiar how\nto get to their print dialogue box.\n\n18\n00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:54.920\nIt's Cmd or Ctrl+P, unless you've changed\nit in your keyboard shortcuts of course,\n\n19\n00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.960\nor it's up under the File menu,\nFile > Print.\n\n20\n00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.080\nNow remember, it's automatically assuming\nthat we're going to CMYK when we created\n\n21\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.420\nall of our documents we kept telling\nit that the intent was print.\n\n22\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.330\nAnd actually, I should probably step\nbackwards on that a little bit.\n\n23\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.360\nWe said print, if we're going to print and\nsomething digital whether it's the web or\n\n24\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.400\nwe're going to a PDF or\nsomething like that.\n\n25\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.730\nAnd for all our examples we're basically\ngoing to print out to a device,\n\n26\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.040\nwhether it's an inkjet printer or\nlaser printer or whatever.\n\n27\n00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.850\nWe're gonna choose that the print dialogue\nbox, and also we're gonna print and\n\n28\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.190\nexport out to a PDF as well.\n\n29\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.219\nSo we started with the more\nconstrained print environment,\n\n30\n00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.727\nwhich means that we have a CMYK\ncolor model which has fewer options.\n\n31\n00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:40.332\nIt's a more restrictive color model, and\n\n32\n00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:43.720\nwe can always grow out from\nthere when we go to RGB.\n\n33\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.030\nSo again, I'm gonna assume we're\ngoing to print right out here.\n\n34\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.610\nWe're going to do File, and choose Print.\n\n35\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.020\nAnd in here is where we choose\neverything that's specific to\n\n36\n00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.470\nwhatever we're printing to.\n\n37\n00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.030\nSo the first thing we need to do is\ncome up to the printer at the top and\n\n38\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.800\nchoose what printer we need.\n\n39\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.250\nNow, we might have\na Print Preset already set up.\n\n40\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.475\nI have one called Friendly Alien,\ndon't you?\n\n41\n00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:08.969\nAnd so but here we would have all\nthe Print Presets that we have for\n\n42\n00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.284\nwhatever it is we're printing to,\nour different devices.\n\n43\n00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:14.670\nBut first we have to set up\nall that information, and\n\n44\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.500\nput in those parameters before\nwe can save that Print Preset.\n\n45\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.960\nSo we need to choose a printer, and I'm\nactually not going to print to anything\n\n46\n00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.850\nspecific, I'm not actually\nhooked to a printer.\n\n47\n00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.640\nBut here's where you'd\nput all your devices,\n\n48\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.260\nwhether it's your to your office\nprinter or whatever it would be here.\n\n49\n00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.166\nWhen you choose that,\n\n50\n00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.939\nyou need to make sure you choose\nthe one you are actually printing to.\n\n51\n00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.243\nBecause that's going to change many\nof the other options that we see in\n\n52\n00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:37.700\nour print dialogue box.\n\n53\n00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.756\nSo I'm just gonna choose one and\nactually I wanna see, if I have one.\n\n54\n00:02:39.756 --> 00:02:42.270\nI don't have one that does\nseparations necessarily.\n\n55\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.506\nWe can do separations, but you're probably\nnot going to be doing that anyway.\n\n56\n00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:50.048\nAnd again most of what I do,\nI don't print for\n\n57\n00:02:50.048 --> 00:02:54.470\nmy final output anymore,\nmost of what I do goes to PDF.\n\n58\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.600\nHowever, I like to print a proof\nobviously for myself, for\n\n59\n00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.410\nmy client, on my own internal devices.\n\n60\n00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.514\nSo I'm just gonna choose the kind\nof printer that I have here, and\n\n61\n00:03:03.514 --> 00:03:05.450\nwe're gonna look at the different options.\n\n62\n00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.840\nObviously, we can choose\nhow many copies we want.\n\n63\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.350\nI'm just going to do one of course, and\nI can't do it from the first order.\n\n64\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.700\nSo these are options that we'll see\nalso a lot of these are repeated\n\n65\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.990\nin the PDF export as well.\n\n66\n00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.910\nPage Range, so if we wanna go ahead and\n\n67\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.260\nput all the pages that are in the document\nor I can choose an individual range.\n\n68\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.860\nAnd I have a few options with that.\n\n69\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.205\nI can choose to do all the pages in\nthe document which is the same as all or\n\n70\n00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:30.812\nI can choose this pull down menu.\n\n71\n00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:33.571\nAnd I can choose from what's\ncalled alternate layouts and\n\n72\n00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:37.640\nthat's something I wont be covering in\nthis could it's a little more advanced.\n\n73\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.550\nBut just know that you can have\ndifferent layouts in the same document.\n\n74\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.555\nI could have my postcards and my business\ncards, and I could have my PDF versions of\n\n75\n00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:47.631\nthem and my print versions of them\nall in the same document, and\n\n76\n00:03:47.631 --> 00:03:49.625\nhere's where I can choose that as well.\n\n77\n00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.330\nI can also choose to print\nAll pages from here.\n\n78\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.440\nI could also print just the Current page,\nwhatever page I'm sitting on.\n\n79\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.605\nAnd in this case, it's v.;1.\n\n80\n00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:03.560\nSo just know that that's the vertical\nlayout and it's the first page.\n\n81\n00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.381\nSo if I'm sitting on one page and\nI just want that page to print,\n\n82\n00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:07.939\nI can also print the current page.\n\n83\n00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.110\nI'm gonna go ahead and say all.\n\n84\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.660\nI can choose if I want to print all\nthe pages or just the even pages or\n\n85\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.550\nthe odd pages.\n\n86\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.880\nAnd I can also choose whether I\nwant individual pages or spreads.\n\n87\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.450\nSo when we looked to the pages panel,\n\n88\n00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.610\nwe saw that we could set two pages side by\nside, that's known as a two page spread.\n\n89\n00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.930\nSo I could print it out as a spread.\n\n90\n00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.481\nSo if I had an 8.5 by 11 sheet, and\nI'm actually gonna cancel out of this and\n\n91\n00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:34.554\njust jump out to the Pages\npanel really quick.\n\n92\n00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:37.748\nThese are 8.5 by 11 pages,\nif I wanted to print\n\n93\n00:04:37.748 --> 00:04:41.776\nthe spread side by side maybe\nit's just this two page document.\n\n94\n00:04:41.776 --> 00:04:45.716\nBut I know they're actually gonna sit\nside by side, either for printing or for\n\n95\n00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:46.980\nthe actual final piece.\n\n96\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.920\nI can go ahead and put those side by side.\n\n97\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.100\nTo do those, we have to go back\nto the Page Panel menu and\n\n98\n00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.390\ndeselect Allow Selected Spreads\nto Shuffle.\n\n99\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.740\nBasically, it says don't constrain\nme to these single pages,\n\n100\n00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.145\nbring this upside side by side and\nI can look at it in this spread.\n\n101\n00:05:03.145 --> 00:05:07.519\nI might wanna print it in a spread like\nthat on an 11 by 17 sheet of paper.\n\n102\n00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.045\nSo I've just doubled it and\nput on the same sheet.\n\n103\n00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:14.048\nSo going back to the print\ndialog box Cmd or Ctrl+P.\n\n104\n00:05:14.048 --> 00:05:17.050\nI can come down here and\nchoose to print that in spreads.\n\n105\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.451\nNow right now if I look down here,\n\n106\n00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.766\neverything I'm making a change\nto shows up over here.\n\n107\n00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:23.724\nAnd it kind of gives you an idea of what\nit's gonna look like when I print it.\n\n108\n00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:27.650\nWell I can kinda see that even this first\npage doesn't fit on the page itself, and\n\n109\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.995\nwe'll see why in a second.\n\n110\n00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:32.745\nBut the second one is completely\nthrown off the page, and\n\n111\n00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:37.687\nthat's because my Cannon printer\nonly does 8.5 by 11 sheet of paper.\n\n112\n00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:42.340\nBut I'm told that to spreads at 100%\nit means it's not all going to fit.\n\n113\n00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.340\nSo always keep in mind\nwhat that looks like.\n\n114\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.970\nSo again, I can kind of see it's\noffset and we're gonna see why.\n\n115\n00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.130\nThat's because I have crop\nmarks probably set up and so\n\n116\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.076\nit needs to accommodate the crop marks\nwhich also won't fit, not at 100% anyway.\n\n117\n00:05:55.076 --> 00:05:57.620\nSo those are some options\nto look at there.\n\n118\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.130\nDown here we have what\nlayers we wanna print, and\n\n119\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.120\nby default Visible &\nPrintable Layers are turned on.\n\n120\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.560\nWhen we worked with layers in a previous\nmovie, we said is this printable?\n\n121\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.290\nDoes everything show up, and\nalso is everything on it visible or\n\n122\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.800\nis the layer itself visible?\n\n123\n00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.157\nYou can choose to print only\nthe visible and printable layers,\n\n124\n00:06:16.157 --> 00:06:18.512\nwhich is probably what\nyou want by default.\n\n125\n00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:20.192\nI like that that's on by default, so\n\n126\n00:06:20.192 --> 00:06:22.973\nyou don't have to think about\nit when you go ahead and print.\n\n127\n00:06:22.973 --> 00:06:26.963\nSo if I set it up as viewable and\nprintable when I created that layer,\n\n128\n00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:29.880\nit will now automatically show up here.\n\n129\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.910\nI could tell it to do all layers, that\nmeans if I have a layer that was a hidden\n\n130\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.340\nlayer, maybe my layer full of notes for\na client, I could go ahead and\n\n131\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.750\nhave that print right away even\nthough it's set to not print.\n\n132\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.402\nSo that's often what I do,\nis if I have my annotations.\n\n133\n00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:46.430\nWhether it's to myself or to my client,\nI have a separate layer for that.\n\n134\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.541\nI might tell it, don't print that layer,\nso I have it set to not print.\n\n135\n00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.483\nBut I can still override that in the print\ndialog box and say yes, let's go ahead and\n\n136\n00:06:54.483 --> 00:06:55.830\nprint that.\n\n137\n00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.280\nMight turn that back to\nthe Visible & Printable Layers.\n\n138\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.690\nI can also tell it to print\nnon-printing objects.\n\n139\n00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.192\nThat sounds like a conundrum or\nI don't know an oxymoron, something.\n\n140\n00:07:04.192 --> 00:07:05.540\nIt just sounds wrong.\n\n141\n00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.966\nPrint non printable objects.\n\n142\n00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:09.640\nWell I can tell objects that\nthey're not printable, but\n\n143\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.480\nI might want them to show up here.\n\n144\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.240\nAnd a good example of that,\nis if I am printing business cards,\n\n145\n00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.305\noften you'll have a company logos that\nare four color, ie expensive to print.\n\n146\n00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:21.819\nAnd you've printed those ahead of time.\n\n147\n00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:23.796\nSo we've got four business cards and\n\n148\n00:07:23.796 --> 00:07:27.765\nthey just have the logos where they\nneed to be in the business card.\n\n149\n00:07:27.765 --> 00:07:30.212\nAnd then later, we're gonna do\nwhat's called an over print.\n\n150\n00:07:30.212 --> 00:07:33.725\nWe're gonna come back and\njust print the people's business card.\n\n151\n00:07:33.725 --> 00:07:36.668\nWe've got four new employees,\nwe want to print their business card and\n\n152\n00:07:36.668 --> 00:07:38.004\nwe put in all that information.\n\n153\n00:07:38.004 --> 00:07:42.718\nAnd we take shells we already have the\nlogo, the expensive four color logo on.\n\n154\n00:07:42.718 --> 00:07:46.363\nAnd we just overprint the black part\nwhere we have the name and address and\n\n155\n00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:49.070\nphone number and\nall that stuff on top of that.\n\n156\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.020\nWell in my InDesign file,\nthat logo needs to be there so\n\n157\n00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.970\nI can see where the logo is, so\nI don't run any text into it.\n\n158\n00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.349\nBut it doesn't need to print,\n\n159\n00:07:58.349 --> 00:08:01.225\nwhen I print that out I just want\nthe black overprint to come out.\n\n160\n00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:05.142\nWell when I come back into the dialogue\nbox here in the print dialogue box,\n\n161\n00:08:05.142 --> 00:08:07.109\nthis is print non printing objects.\n\n162\n00:08:07.109 --> 00:08:08.896\nI want those logos to show up.\n\n163\n00:08:08.896 --> 00:08:13.490\nNot in the final piece, but\nwhen I'm doing a proof for a client.\n\n164\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.270\nBecause I can't tell you how many times\nI've just printed out the black, and\n\n165\n00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.840\nthe client says where's my logo.\n\n166\n00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.920\nThere's supposed to be a logo, and\nyou have to explain to them again.\n\n167\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.520\nIt's there.\n\n168\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.580\nIt's already printed.\n\n169\n00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.800\nSo I'll turn that on and say here's what\nwe look at, or if my notes to myself or\n\n170\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.910\nto my client, are set to non-print.\n\n171\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.180\nI can turn that on for\nthis instance, for a proof.\n\n172\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.960\nI'm gonna turn it back off when I do\nthe final print, or when I export to PDF.\n\n173\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.520\nI can also choose to print blank pages.\n\n174\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.110\nThis is something that should\nbe on by default, probably cuz\n\n175\n00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.140\nthere are a lot of times, you'll have\na blank page and it needs to be there.\n\n176\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.370\nSo that your page three, or your\nchapter starts on the right hand side.\n\n177\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.590\nYou might have a blank\npage sitting next to it.\n\n178\n00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.490\nSo I'll generally leave that turned on,\nand I can go ahead and\n\n179\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.730\nprint visible guides, and baseline grids.\n\n180\n00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.660\nThis is if we've set up\nguides in the background, or\n\n181\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.610\nwe just want to see where that's set up.\n\n182\n00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.350\nI rarely use that, but you might,\nif you're setting up say a new newsletter.\n\n183\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.990\nAnd you want to make sure that they\nguides are set up, and the whole kind of\n\n184\n00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.910\noverlay and the kind of structure\nto your document looks good to you.\n\n185\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.780\nSo by printing it, I can actually see\nwhat the underlying structure is.\n\n186\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.890\nAgain, this would not be for the final\noutput, but something that you work on.\n\n187\n00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.170\nI can also go back into the next pane,\nwhich is setup.\n\n188\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.360\nAnd setup,\nthis is where we choose what size paper.\n\n189\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.940\nNow again, you only have options based\non the printer that you chose up above.\n\n190\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.377\nSo down here I cannot choose 1117 because\nthis printer does not allow for it.\n\n191\n00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:35.287\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and say, nope.\n\n192\n00:09:35.287 --> 00:09:36.950\nI want it to be only 8.5 by 11.\n\n193\n00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.510\nWe still have some issues down here where\nit's not lined up on that paper yet, but\n\n194\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.170\nwe'll keep an eye on that.\n\n195\n00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.400\nI can choose to scale it,\nthe width and the height.\n\n196\n00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.980\nI can constrain the proportions.\n\n197\n00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.900\nSo I could make that fit with whatever's\ncausing that to be pushed off the page.\n\n198\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.230\nMaybe we print it at 80%, or\nmaybe I just tell it scale to fit.\n\n199\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.660\nAnd when I do that,\nI can now see that there's enough.\n\n200\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.700\nWell, I have a bleed.\n\n201\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.710\nI can tell by that little red\nmark that's around there.\n\n202\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.020\nWe set this document up with a bleed, and\n\n203\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.720\na bleed remember is where\nthe image comes off the page.\n\n204\n00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.887\nYou print it on a larger sheet of paper,\nand you come back and trim it.\n\n205\n00:10:11.887 --> 00:10:14.893\nSo in this case,\nwith the bleed it's 8.5 X 11.\n\n206\n00:10:14.893 --> 00:10:17.770\nPlus I have an eighth of an inch\nbleed all the way around.\n\n207\n00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:23.510\nSo that's going to be 8.75 X 11.25\nI think, if I did my math properly.\n\n208\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.030\nSo I have that, and so\nI need that amount of space.\n\n209\n00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.360\nPlus I need a little extra room,\n\n210\n00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.720\nbecause remember whatever you're printing\nthrough has to grab that paper as well.\n\n211\n00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.040\nSo I probably print that\non a 9 X 12 sheet of paper.\n\n212\n00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.060\nI can't do that on this printer.\n\n213\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.565\nIt only does 8.5 X 11.\n\n214\n00:10:37.565 --> 00:10:41.330\nSo I either have to scale it down to fit,\nand since we're just doing a proof.\n\n215\n00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.081\nThat seems like a perfect\nsolution to that problem.\n\n216\n00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:48.473\nI can also tell where it sits on the page\nif I don't have it scaled to fit.\n\n217\n00:10:48.473 --> 00:10:51.166\nI can come in here and\njust choose where it sits, move it around.\n\n218\n00:10:51.166 --> 00:10:53.192\nGenerally, I leave it at centered.\n\n219\n00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:54.947\nI can also do thumbnails.\n\n220\n00:10:54.947 --> 00:10:58.930\nSo maybe I'm doing a book that is 8.5\nX 11, and I wanna print out a proof.\n\n221\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.560\nAnd I've got a lot of pages,\nbut I don't wanna waste paper.\n\n222\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.700\nSo I wanna go ahead and\nput thumbnails on there.\n\n223\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.440\nI can do this basically two up.\n\n224\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.690\nI would not use this for printing,\nbecause it's not really accurate.\n\n225\n00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.023\nWhere it throws those two thumbnails,\nor those four thumbnails, or\n\n226\n00:11:13.023 --> 00:11:14.757\nwhatever we end up with on the page.\n\n227\n00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:18.720\nIt's just a great way to get the pages\nkinda squashed down onto the page.\n\n228\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.631\nSo we can look at that.\n\n229\n00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:23.083\nPlus, it puts a little line\naround where the page edge is.\n\n230\n00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:25.170\nSo that wouldn't help us in printing.\n\n231\n00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.830\nIt's again, more for proofing the thing.\n\n232\n00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.670\nAlso, if you do have\nsomething that's really huge.\n\n233\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:30.720\nLet's come back up here.\n\n234\n00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.650\nI'm gonna go back to General really quick.\n\n235\n00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.566\nChoose spreads, and\nthen go back to set up and say tile.\n\n236\n00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:38.460\nWell I can tile it if\nI want it in spreads.\n\n237\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.230\nI can also tile it so that prints out\nwhat it can on the sheet of paper and\n\n238\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.650\ncontinues it on the next sheet of paper.\n\n239\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.988\nAnd it basically gives you\nan amount of overlap, and\n\n240\n00:11:46.988 --> 00:11:49.127\nthat's what this overlap\namount is down here.\n\n241\n00:11:49.127 --> 00:11:53.253\nSo basically, it's if you have something\nreally big you want to print at 100%, but\n\n242\n00:11:53.253 --> 00:11:55.504\nyour printer can't print\non a page that large.\n\n243\n00:11:55.504 --> 00:11:58.834\nYou can tile it, and then you’d have\nto do the old fashion paste it up,\n\n244\n00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:01.833\na little tape, a little glue or\nwhatever, put that together.\n\n245\n00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:04.417\nBut it gives you an overlap, and\nit gives you a little crop marks as well.\n\n246\n00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:06.497\nSo you can line it up easily.\n\n247\n00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:08.084\nAgain, this is stuff for proofing.\n\n248\n00:12:08.084 --> 00:12:10.316\nThis is not gonna be for the final sheet.\n\n249\n00:12:10.316 --> 00:12:12.676\nLet me go back into General and\njust put pages back on.\n\n250\n00:12:12.676 --> 00:12:14.480\nSo it looks a little bit\nmore like we’re expecting.\n\n251\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.285\nMarks and bleeds.\n\n252\n00:12:17.285 --> 00:12:21.214\nMarks and bleeds are something that you’ll\nuse in if you are sending this out for\n\n253\n00:12:21.214 --> 00:12:23.180\nprint, or even if you're doing it.\n\n254\n00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.205\nLet's say you're doing it yourself, and\nyou're making postcards on your inkjet\n\n255\n00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.660\nprinter, or it's just something\nthat you're doing either in-house,\n\n256\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.940\nor you're a design student and\nyou're just getting started.\n\n257\n00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.090\nAnd you are going to do this\nwhole job start to finish.\n\n258\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.740\nYou're not gonna send it out to a printer.\n\n259\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.680\nIt's something decent, you got\na decent printer you can do and you're\n\n260\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.636\ngonna do post cards and maybe you're\ngoing to do two of them up on a page.\n\n261\n00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:43.980\nThey're 4 X 6 postcards.\n\n262\n00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.970\nYou're gonna put them on\nan 8.5 X 11 sheet of paper.\n\n263\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.550\nYou've used your libraries\nwith the crops and the guides,\n\n264\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.570\nand you've laid it out beautifully.\n\n265\n00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.780\nAnd you're gonna print it out on some\nnice card stock on your inkjet or\n\n266\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.350\nlaser printer.\n\n267\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.652\nYour jet printer.\n\n268\n00:12:55.652 --> 00:13:00.642\nYou're gonna want some guides,\nwhere to trim that particular item.\n\n269\n00:13:00.642 --> 00:13:05.100\nSo I've seen people that will print it\nout with a key line around each one.\n\n270\n00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.089\nPrint one out that way.\n\n271\n00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:07.910\nThen print the rest out without,\nand lay it on top.\n\n272\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.060\nBut things move,\nI like to have crop marks on the page.\n\n273\n00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.130\nAnd maybe that's just cuz I'm old school,\nI started in printing and I like that.\n\n274\n00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.090\nBut the marks and bleeds are important.\n\n275\n00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.470\nThe ones that I use only pretty much,\nCrop Box.\n\n276\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.033\nThere's a lot of other stuff,\nregistration marks, color bars.\n\n277\n00:13:23.033 --> 00:13:25.641\nThese are things that are geared\ntowards the print industry,\n\n278\n00:13:25.641 --> 00:13:27.959\nthat we've been using forever\nin the print industry.\n\n279\n00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:30.538\nBut, even when I was\nworking a lot in print.\n\n280\n00:13:30.538 --> 00:13:32.963\nI don't do as much anymore\nin the print industry,\n\n281\n00:13:32.963 --> 00:13:35.174\nbecause I've gone to\na lot of digital stuff.\n\n282\n00:13:35.174 --> 00:13:37.699\nBut even when I'm doing that,\nI would never put color bars for\n\n283\n00:13:37.699 --> 00:13:38.920\nregistration marks.\n\n284\n00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.750\nThat's something the person who\nruns the press really wants to do.\n\n285\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.260\nThey each have their own individual\nthing that they need to do.\n\n286\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.980\nAnd that's just stuff that goes off on\nthe side, that will get trimmed off later.\n\n287\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.367\nColor bars just to make sure\nall the colors are the same and\n\n288\n00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:52.326\naccurate and mixing.\n\n289\n00:13:52.326 --> 00:13:56.171\nA good example of color bars is, if you\never looked at packaging on cereal or\n\n290\n00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:59.725\nanything like that, any of\nthe cardboard packaging under the flap.\n\n291\n00:13:59.725 --> 00:14:00.587\nIt'll have those squares.\n\n292\n00:14:00.587 --> 00:14:03.420\nYou'll see cyan, magenta,\nyellow, and black squares.\n\n293\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.380\nAnd they're all lined up and\nthere's little targets,\n\n294\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.598\nlittle circles with x's in them.\n\n295\n00:14:06.598 --> 00:14:09.234\nThose are targets and that's where\nthe printer, as it came through.\n\n296\n00:14:09.234 --> 00:14:12.268\nThey made sure that they lined up and\nthey didn't get offset at all.\n\n297\n00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:13.901\nWhere you've got the yellow and\n\n298\n00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:16.510\nthe magenta not sitting\nright on top of each other.\n\n299\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.070\nThat's what those are.\n\n300\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.540\nThose are color bars.\n\n301\n00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.350\nI don't use those very often.\n\n302\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.278\nCrop marks, super important though.\n\n303\n00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:25.365\nI even do crop marks a lot of\ntimes when I'm exporting to pdf.\n\n304\n00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:29.465\nAnd one thing you do need to keep in mind,\nwhether you're printing or\n\n305\n00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:33.790\nexporting the pdf, is the weight and\nthe offset of the crop marks.\n\n306\n00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.530\nSo here's a weird little thing.\n\n307\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.850\nSo I've told it that I wanna bleed, right?\n\n308\n00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:41.270\nSo it says Use Document Bleed Settings\ndown here, right?\n\n309\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.830\nSo it says, Use Document Bleed Settings\nwhich automatically gives me that\n\n310\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.340\neighth of an inch that we created\nwhen we created this document.\n\n311\n00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.290\nWe said give it a bleed\namount of eighth of an inch.\n\n312\n00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.990\nSo by default, in some versions,\nthis is turned off.\n\n313\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.090\nAnd it says, we created with a bleed.\n\n314\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.990\nWe made sure images came out to a bleed.\n\n315\n00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.700\nAnd then we didn't select use document\nbleed settings when we exported or\n\n316\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.980\nwhen we printed.\n\n317\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.540\nAnd so there's no bleed amount.\n\n318\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.090\nSo it's just gonna trim it\nright at the edge of the page.\n\n319\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.920\nWe need that bleed setting to go past.\n\n320\n00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.370\nWe need the entire image to bleed\nthe amount that we told it to bleed.\n\n321\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.070\nSo we need to make sure that is\nchecked if we used to bleed.\n\n322\n00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.160\nBut, what happens is with a crop mark.\n\n323\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.421\nYou notice we have\nan eighth of an inch bleed.\n\n324\n00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:26.066\nWell back up here we have the weight,\nhow thick the stroke is.\n\n325\n00:15:26.066 --> 00:15:28.577\nA quarter point is plenty.\n\n326\n00:15:28.577 --> 00:15:33.175\nBut the offset I don't know 0.0833\nworks out into in fraction, but\n\n327\n00:15:33.175 --> 00:15:36.304\nI can tell you it's less\nthan an eighth of an inch.\n\n328\n00:15:36.304 --> 00:15:38.300\nSo what happened is we have this bleed.\n\n329\n00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.936\nWe have a sheet of paper,\nand we have a bleed.\n\n330\n00:15:40.936 --> 00:15:45.427\nAnd we've said make sure the image goes\nan eighth of an inch past where it's\n\n331\n00:15:45.427 --> 00:15:46.230\ngonna trim.\n\n332\n00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.740\nAnd we made sure the images\nhave pulled out that far, but\n\n333\n00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.940\nthen we've put crop marks that\ndon't stick out at least that far.\n\n334\n00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.229\nThey've come into the image.\n\n335\n00:15:53.229 --> 00:15:55.399\nSo what happens is when\nyou trim that image back.\n\n336\n00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:59.680\nYou're gonna have leftover bits of\nyour crop mark that kind of edged in.\n\n337\n00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.720\nI know it's kind of hard\nto maybe visualize, but\n\n338\n00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.560\ntry printing out a couple of them\nwith a bleed and see what happens.\n\n339\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.480\nSo, what does not happen in\nthe design is it doesn't say\n\n340\n00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.278\nyou have an eighth of an inch bleed.\n\n341\n00:16:09.278 --> 00:16:11.881\nPerhaps your offset should be\nat least an eighth of an inch.\n\n342\n00:16:11.881 --> 00:16:14.082\nYou have to change that manually.\n\n343\n00:16:14.082 --> 00:16:17.295\nSo keep that in mind, if you're If you're\nusing crop marks, make sure they're far\n\n344\n00:16:17.295 --> 00:16:20.665\nenough out to accommodate everything that\nyou've put on the page, including bleeds.\n\n345\n00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.190\nHopefully, your head is not too\nfull of this printing stuff yet.\n\n346\n00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.240\nAgain, this is stuff that we show at\nthe end, after, hopefully, you've watch\n\n347\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.140\na lot of the prior episodes, so that you\nknow what it is we are talking about.\n\n348\n00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.610\nThis is something that you have to wait\nuntil you understand all the things you\n\n349\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.040\nput on the page to put into\nwhat the print output.\n\n350\n00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.900\nHowever, in reality, when you're working,\n\n351\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.150\nthis is something you need to be\nthinking about in the very beginning.\n\n352\n00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.108\nSo I know that's kind of hard,\nbut that's how work flow goes.\n\n353\n00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:49.922\nWe have to always be thinking\nbackwards and forwards.\n\n354\n00:16:49.922 --> 00:16:54.394\nWhat's gone into it, and what do we\nneed to get out of it at the end?\n\n355\n00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:55.540\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n356\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.260\nWe're gonna jump back into\nthe Print dialogue box and Output.\n\n357\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.900\nNow Output, if you're just printing for\na proof, like to your inkjet printer or\n\n358\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.140\nsomething like that, you're probably not\ngoing to touch anything that's here.\n\n359\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.212\nYou're gonna do Composite.\n\n360\n00:17:09.212 --> 00:17:12.271\nAnd Composite Gray is my only choice for\nthis.\n\n361\n00:17:12.271 --> 00:17:13.707\nActually, no, I have Composite CMYK.\n\n362\n00:17:13.707 --> 00:17:14.600\nWill it let me?\n\n363\n00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.590\nIt will let me do RGB.\n\n364\n00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:17.740\nBut depending on the printer, you may or\n\n365\n00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.990\nmay not be able to choose\neverything that's here.\n\n366\n00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.310\nIf it's a black and white printer, your\nonly choice is going to be Composite Gray,\n\n367\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.020\nor possibly, Separations.\n\n368\n00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.900\nNow I don't have this setup.\n\n369\n00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.960\nIt won't let me do Separations.\n\n370\n00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.320\nIt does let me do composite RGB.\n\n371\n00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.755\nNow, I said when anything gets printed,\nit becomes CMYK.\n\n372\n00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:37.420\nBut you notice, I couldn't choose CMYK.\n\n373\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.650\nCertain printers, certain actual\ndesktop printers that you have,\n\n374\n00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.364\nmight actually only\naccept RGB information.\n\n375\n00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:49.015\nBut before it spits out on that\npiece of paper, it will be CMYK.\n\n376\n00:17:49.015 --> 00:17:53.970\nAnd that's because the printer\nitself is doing that conversion.\n\n377\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.802\nTell it RGB if you want, or\n\n378\n00:17:55.802 --> 00:17:58.010\nComposite Gray,\nif you want it to all show up in grey.\n\n379\n00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.210\nLet me choose another printer and\nsee what else we can come up with.\n\n380\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.552\nLet's try, this one is a color printer.\n\n381\n00:18:03.552 --> 00:18:05.400\nNope, it also does not let me do that.\n\n382\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.970\nAgain, some of these are just printers\nthat I don't even actually have\n\n383\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:08.540\naccess to anymore.\n\n384\n00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.400\nThey've just been left behind\nin the presets that I have here.\n\n385\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.310\nSo let's go ahead and put back to this\n340 and we'll see if we can do one.\n\n386\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.550\nAll right, so it still is just RGB.\n\n387\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.927\nSo the Canon ones, obviously,\nthey wanna take in RGB information.\n\n388\n00:18:20.927 --> 00:18:23.030\nAnd they want to do\nthe conversion on their end.\n\n389\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.330\nSo again, you're limited by\nwhatever printer you have selected.\n\n390\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.447\nIf you can do Composite CMYK, and\nthat's how you're printing, that's great.\n\n391\n00:18:29.447 --> 00:18:33.044\nBecause then you know that InDesign\nis doing the color conversion,\n\n392\n00:18:33.044 --> 00:18:34.570\nand not the printer itself.\n\n393\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.770\nFor me, I don't like the printer to\ndo the color conversion because I\n\n394\n00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.180\ndon't know what kind of\nsoftware is in there.\n\n395\n00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.340\nIf I do it through Adobe,\nI know that it's all using,\n\n396\n00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.470\nno matter what Adobe program I'm using,\nit's using the same color engine.\n\n397\n00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.520\nI can also do separations, possibly.\n\n398\n00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.190\nI can't on this one, particularly.\n\n399\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.390\nSeparations would let me print out one for\neach of those plates.\n\n400\n00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.800\nAnd we have those cyan,\nmagenta, yellow, and\n\n401\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.840\nblack plates,\nplus the Pantone plate as well.\n\n402\n00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.680\nAnd that's something,\nif you are doing separations and\n\n403\n00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.710\nyou needed to do a proof and make sure.\n\n404\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.552\nEven though we viewed it\nin the Separation's panel,\n\n405\n00:19:05.552 --> 00:19:08.783\nwe might actually need to print\nout the separations as well.\n\n406\n00:19:08.783 --> 00:19:12.122\nJust to make sure that it's printing\nout on all the right plates so that,\n\n407\n00:19:12.122 --> 00:19:14.966\nwhen I send it to printer,\nI know that it will also print out for\n\n408\n00:19:14.966 --> 00:19:16.470\nthem on the right plates.\n\n409\n00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.250\nBut again,\nif you're not working in the production,\n\n410\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.900\nyou're probably not gonna use this much.\n\n411\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.170\nProbably leave it whatever was that,\nComposite Gray.\n\n412\n00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:26.680\nHere's something that we will\nneed to look at, is Graphics.\n\n413\n00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.550\nHow are we handling these graphics?\n\n414\n00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.493\nSo it says, do I wanna send?\n\n415\n00:19:30.493 --> 00:19:34.574\nWhen I send graphics to the machine,\nto this desktop printer that we're using,\n\n416\n00:19:34.574 --> 00:19:38.320\nthis Canon one, do I wanna send all\nof the data that's involved in there?\n\n417\n00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.072\nAnd this is something to consider.\n\n418\n00:19:40.072 --> 00:19:41.960\nYou probably don't.\n\n419\n00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.510\nBecause what that means\nis that it will take,\n\n420\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.590\nif we have a real high-resolution image,\nand let's say it was really\n\n421\n00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:55.270\nbig to start with, maybe it was 2400\npixels wide, and we placed it small.\n\n422\n00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.936\nAnd we looked at when we placed\nimages in an earlier episode,\n\n423\n00:19:57.936 --> 00:19:59.940\nwhen we place it small,\nwe gain resolution.\n\n424\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.510\nSo now maybe let's say that\nresolution's up to 4800 pixels.\n\n425\n00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:08.450\nSo that's gonna translate to 4800 dots\nper inch when we print that out, so\n\n426\n00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.930\nnow we've got 4800.\n\n427\n00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.890\nWell, when we go to print on a press,\nwe only need 300.\n\n428\n00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.487\nWhen we print to a office machine,\nmaybe 150.\n\n429\n00:20:16.487 --> 00:20:22.148\nBut if I say all and I send that, that\nentire 4800 pixels worth of information\n\n430\n00:20:22.148 --> 00:20:27.240\nis being sent to the printer and\nthat printer can't even understand it.\n\n431\n00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.621\nIt's gonna spit out 150 anyway but\n\n432\n00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:30.748\nyou just sent all that information\nto it on that one photo.\n\n433\n00:20:30.748 --> 00:20:35.220\nNow multiply that times the number\nof photos that's in your document.\n\n434\n00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.670\nThat is a lot of information to overload\nyour poor, little $100 printer with.\n\n435\n00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.982\nAnd trust me, you're gonna be standing\nthere a long time waiting for that,\n\n436\n00:20:42.982 --> 00:20:45.540\nespecially if it's not\na PostScript printer.\n\n437\n00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:50.140\nPrinting from InDesign to a non-PostScript\nprinter can take forever.\n\n438\n00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.998\nIn fact, I mostly make PDFs even to print\ndirectly out because then Acrobat and\n\n439\n00:20:55.998 --> 00:20:59.460\nPDF has actually done the conversion for\nme and\n\n440\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.307\nI'm only sending an optimized\nfile to my printer.\n\n441\n00:21:03.307 --> 00:21:07.008\nSo keep in mind, if you go back to that\nimages and you Send All, it's going to try\n\n442\n00:21:07.008 --> 00:21:10.870\nand cram all that information and\noverload your printer with that.\n\n443\n00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.700\nYou can also do None,\nwhich will give you gray boxes.\n\n444\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.720\nWhich may or may not be helpful.\n\n445\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.900\nYou might want to be looking at\nthe structure of your document and\n\n446\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.950\nnot the actual images themselves,\nso that might work for you.\n\n447\n00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.594\nProxy will send a low\nresolution version to that, and\n\n448\n00:21:23.594 --> 00:21:25.195\nthat also might be good enough.\n\n449\n00:21:25.195 --> 00:21:28.029\nIf you're just doing a proof,\nyou know that your images look good,\n\n450\n00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:31.575\nyou just wanna see where they're sitting\nand make sure they're in the right place.\n\n451\n00:21:31.575 --> 00:21:35.470\nYou don't care that they're gonna be\nbitmapped or pixelated when it comes out.\n\n452\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.630\nYou can leave that.\n\n453\n00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.980\nIf you're doing a final piece,\n\n454\n00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.410\nyou're doing that four by six\npostcard sample I just mentioned.\n\n455\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.340\nWhere you're actually doing the final\npiece and you're printing it on\n\n456\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.700\nyour office printer on card stock, you're\ngonna want to choose Optimize Subsampling.\n\n457\n00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.250\nSampling.\n\n458\n00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.980\nAnd what that means is it's going to,\nI say dumb it down but\n\n459\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.250\nI don't really mean dumb, but it's going\nto bring everything down to give you\n\n460\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.080\nthe best image, so the most resolution\nto give you the best image, for\n\n461\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.980\nwhat your output device can handle.\n\n462\n00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.750\nAnd that's why choosing that printer\nin the very beginning is so important.\n\n463\n00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.740\nNot only does it give you options that\nare available to that printer, but\n\n464\n00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.790\nit knows what the maximum\noutput that printer can handle.\n\n465\n00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:19.200\nSo that 2400 or 4800 pixel example that I\njust mentioned, we gonna size that down.\n\n466\n00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.808\nBut's it's only going to spit out\nwhat that printer can handle.\n\n467\n00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:24.625\nSo Optimize Subsampling is\nwhat is on by default and\n\n468\n00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:27.123\nwhat we should probably\nuse most of the time.\n\n469\n00:22:27.123 --> 00:22:30.227\nBecause it's gonna send only what it\ncan but, it's not going to send so\n\n470\n00:22:30.227 --> 00:22:31.700\nlittle that it can't handle it.\n\n471\n00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.040\nAs long as it's there in that\nimage that you placed in InDesign,\n\n472\n00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.860\nit will send the best thing\nit can to that printer.\n\n473\n00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.820\nColor Management, you may or\nmay not need to touch at all.\n\n474\n00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.030\nI tend not to because I've told it\nin my intent what I'm going to.\n\n475\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:51.600\nI've told it I'm going to CMYK,\nand so it knows it's CMYK.\n\n476\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.435\nIt's gonna use the built-in\nprofiles that are here.\n\n477\n00:22:53.435 --> 00:22:56.570\nI'm not going to make\nmany changes to this.\n\n478\n00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.860\nEspecially because if you're not\nin a color-managed work flow,\n\n479\n00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.360\na lot of this is just\na guessing game anyway.\n\n480\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.200\nSo I tend to use\nthe defaults that are there.\n\n481\n00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.870\nColor management is a set\nof voodoo all unto itself,\n\n482\n00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:12.410\nand if you're not managing your color\nworkflow, it's really just random anyway.\n\n483\n00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.130\nSo that's basically my\ntake on color management.\n\n484\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.350\nBecause it is a thing, but most people\ndon't have such a managed work flow\n\n485\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.180\nthat a lot of it is kind of iffy anyway.\n\n486\n00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.380\nAdvanced, though.\n\n487\n00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:22.920\nWe come in here.\n\n488\n00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.010\nWe may or may not have issues here.\n\n489\n00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.721\nThis does not let me choose\na transparency flattener, and\n\n490\n00:23:27.721 --> 00:23:30.281\nwe'll actually look at this\nwhen we do the PDF export.\n\n491\n00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:33.991\nBut the PDF export and here,\nif it's an option available to us,\n\n492\n00:23:33.991 --> 00:23:35.860\nis where we do that flattening.\n\n493\n00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.961\nWe talked about in the transparency\nepisode that it needs to flatten it at\n\n494\n00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:40.750\nsome point.\n\n495\n00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.120\nThis is where we tell it how\nit handles transparency.\n\n496\n00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.860\nHow good of a result do we\nget with that transparency?\n\n497\n00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.710\nBut again, there's not many options\nhere because of the particular\n\n498\n00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.050\nprinter that we chose.\n\n499\n00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.110\nYou are probably never\ngoing to use this OPI.\n\n500\n00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.510\nIf you're using an OPI workflow, you\nknow it and you know what to do with it.\n\n501\n00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.430\nMost people are not anymore.\n\n502\n00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:04.710\nI can also choose to print this as\na bitmap, and that is on by default for\n\n503\n00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.400\nsome strange reason.\n\n504\n00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.560\nI'm gonna turn that off.\n\n505\n00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.323\nMaybe that printer,\nthat's the default for that.\n\n506\n00:24:08.323 --> 00:24:11.821\nBut a Print as bitmap means that\nit's gonna take everything and\n\n507\n00:24:11.821 --> 00:24:12.943\nmake it as a bitmap or\n\n508\n00:24:12.943 --> 00:24:17.307\na rasterized version of And then I'd tell\nit what resolution it needs to be at.\n\n509\n00:24:17.307 --> 00:24:20.142\nThis is something I would\nprobably never use by default,\n\n510\n00:24:20.142 --> 00:24:24.170\nbecause what that's gonna do is take all\nthat text as well, and rasterize that.\n\n511\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.770\nAnd I really don't want that to happen.\n\n512\n00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.330\nSo I would make sure this was turned off,\n\n513\n00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.130\nmost likely, unless there's a reason for\nyou to use it.\n\n514\n00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.060\nAnd there is a summary, we can look\nat everything we just put in there.\n\n515\n00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.745\nThe last thing I want to look at in\nthe pridalic box is this printer\n\n516\n00:24:35.745 --> 00:24:39.977\nbutton down at the bottom, it does tell\nyou if the same option is available\n\n517\n00:24:39.977 --> 00:24:42.843\nin the dialog we are going too and\nthe one we are in,\n\n518\n00:24:42.843 --> 00:24:47.036\nmake sure we do it in what we were just\nin which is the InDesign dialog one.\n\n519\n00:24:47.036 --> 00:24:51.546\nThe one we are going too is out to\na dialog box that is generated from\n\n520\n00:24:51.546 --> 00:24:54.260\nthe printer that we've chosen.\n\n521\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.060\nSo in here I've got some\nspecific printer stuff.\n\n522\n00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.640\nYou may have lots of options,\nyou may have a only couple.\n\n523\n00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.640\nIn this case,\nit's just a little inkjet printer.\n\n524\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.990\nIt does not have many options at all,\nbut if I set an option here, and\n\n525\n00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.350\nI set an option here,\n\n526\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.850\nthe one that's here in this InDesign A\ndialog box is going to take precedence.\n\n527\n00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.040\nAnd why that matters is because if you\nchange it over there and you come back.\n\n528\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.930\nYou're going to see that what was\nthere might not have changed.\n\n529\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.360\nAnd also, when I save that preset.\n\n530\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.560\nWhich is what we're going to do right now.\n\n531\n00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.880\nWe're going to click,\nsave preset, at the bottom.\n\n532\n00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.340\nAnd I don't want to enter all this\ninformation for this next time I do this.\n\n533\n00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.840\nSo I might call this.\n\n534\n00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.034\nI might call this medium resolution,\nand it might be for the Canon,\n\n535\n00:25:31.034 --> 00:25:32.071\nwhat do we have?\n\n536\n00:25:32.071 --> 00:25:32.822\nThe 160?\n\n537\n00:25:32.822 --> 00:25:33.910\n340.\n\n538\n00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:34.823\nSo the Canon 340.\n\n539\n00:25:34.823 --> 00:25:38.210\nSo I know it's a medium resolution,\nor I might call it proofs.\n\n540\n00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.730\nI might call it proofs for\na specific client.\n\n541\n00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.650\nBecause maybe a specific client wants us\nto have those high-resolution images,\n\n542\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.858\nwhereas normally I would do it low.\n\n543\n00:25:44.858 --> 00:25:47.360\nSo I'm gonna name it something that\nmakes sense to me that I can use\n\n544\n00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.440\nagain and again.\n\n545\n00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.400\nSo now next time I go to print out\nthis same exact document I want to\n\n546\n00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.170\nmake sure I have the same information in\nhere, I can just choose from the preset\n\n547\n00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.190\nthat medium resolution\ncanon that we just created.\n\n548\n00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.820\nSo I don't have to enter all that\nagain and then we would just hit\n\n549\n00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.830\nprint from there and\nit's gonna go ahead and print out for us.\n\n550\n00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.005\nSo you can see that you\nhave to make a few choices.\n\n551\n00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:09.315\nNow if you're just doing proofs,\nyou've got a lot of leeway.\n\n552\n00:26:09.315 --> 00:26:11.895\nIf you're going to be\nactually outputting for\n\n553\n00:26:11.895 --> 00:26:16.185\nyour final, that's the final destination\nof this piece, is you outputting it.\n\n554\n00:26:16.185 --> 00:26:20.930\nWhether it's to a desktop printer or\nit's to a rip device at a print shop,\n\n555\n00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:24.390\nyou need to make sure that you send\nthe best information you can for\n\n556\n00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.750\nthat printer to handle,\nto give you the output and\n\n557\n00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.800\nthe results that you're expecting\nfrom the piece that you've created.\n\n558\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.380\n>> All right Erica,\n\n559\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.610\nit looks like we're getting one step\ncloser to a final project here.\n\n560\n00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.310\nNow, it does look like we're coming to the\nend of another episode, but before we do,\n\n561\n00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.730\ndo you have any additional\nwords about printing?\n\n562\n00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.050\n>> Just know where it's going and\nknow what the options are for\n\n563\n00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.460\nthe device you're printing to.\n\n564\n00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.300\n>> All right, good advice.\n\n565\n00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.950\nThank you for being here in the studios\nand thank you to the viewer for watching.\n\n566\n00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.430\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n567\n00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.460\n>>

00:00:14.786\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.900\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.880\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n6\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.890\nThat's right, focusing in on InDesign.\n\n7\n00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.060\nAnd joining me back in\nthe studios today is Erica Gamet.\n\n8\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.950\nErica, how you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.650\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.650\n>> Great.\nThank you for\n\n11\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.400\ntaking us along this journey that\nis InDesign, where we going next?\n\n12\n00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.140\n>> We are going to start doing\nsome pre flighting and packaging.\n\n13\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.680\n>> All right.\n\n14\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.650\n>> All right.\nSo pre flighting is just the thing\n\n15\n00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.690\nthat we have to do before\nwe send it somewhere else,\n\n16\n00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.050\nwhether it's going digital or\nprint, we need to pre flight it.\n\n17\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.000\nAnd InDesign actually has something called\nLive Pre Flighting which means it can do\n\n18\n00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.560\nit as we're working.\n\n19\n00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.020\nSo it's always doing it in the background.\n\n20\n00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.600\nSometimes I shut it off because it does\ntake a little bit extra process or time.\n\n21\n00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.170\nBut it's something that's\nalways constantly checking for\n\n22\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.080\nus to make sure that the stuff we're\nputting in here will give us that\n\n23\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.670\nend piece that we're looking for.\n\n24\n00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.960\nAnd it's a theme that I've been\nhitting in all the episodes.\n\n25\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.700\nMake sure you know what's happening to\nyour files from the very beginning.\n\n26\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.580\nWell, if you don't tell InDesign in your\nPreflight what it's suppose to be doing.\n\n27\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.810\nWhere it's suppose to end up.\n\n28\n00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.140\nThere's no way it can check it and\nmake sure that it's doing it right.\n\n29\n00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.200\nIt will use whatever's built in and\nit might say this is a problem.\n\n30\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.270\nBut it's not really a problem because you\nhaven't told it where your actually going\n\n31\n00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.990\nto end up with this particular piece.\n\n32\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.500\nSo that's what Preflighting is.\n\n33\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.850\nWe're going to first look at\nthe live Preflighting for that.\n\n34\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.940\nAnd then we are going go into packaging,\n\n35\n00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.950\nwhich is basically when we need to\nsend this file to somebody else.\n\n36\n00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.460\nWe're actually sending\nthe InDesign file to someone else.\n\n37\n00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.230\nSo we'll look into the reasons why we\nmay or may not want to do that as well.\n\n38\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.040\nSo let's start with the Preflighting to\nmake sure that the file that we have,\n\n39\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.240\nno matter what we're doing with it,\nprinting, or exporting, or\n\n40\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.660\nsending it to somebody else, is set with\nthe parameters that we needed to VM.\n\n41\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.700\nSo we're gonna open up live Preflighting.\n\n42\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.360\nAnd it's way down here at the bottom.\n\n43\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.020\nLet's scroll down here, make sure we\ndon't hit my Mac doc that's down here.\n\n44\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.640\nBut I have a couple different options down\nhere, I'm actually gonna pull this up but\n\n45\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.060\nthis is how we get to it.\n\n46\n00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.650\nWe need to come down here and choose one\nof these little arrows that are here.\n\n47\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.960\nAnd actually,\nI'm gonna do this one over here.\n\n48\n00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.530\nGotta be very good with the zoom on,\nand I wanna choose the Preflight Panel.\n\n49\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.200\nThat's all I'm trying to do is\nget that to pop up so it's there.\n\n50\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.140\nI just wanted to show you where it\nnormally lives, and one of the things down\n\n51\n00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.800\nat the bottom, you notice there's a big\ngreen button, and it says no errors.\n\n52\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.880\nWell, it says no errors, but\n\n53\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.700\nI haven't even told it what it's\nsupposed to be looking for.\n\n54\n00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.460\nSo of course I have no errors.\n\n55\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.010\nBut for me, I tend to have a lot of errors\nthere all the time, and that's okay.\n\n56\n00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.000\nBecause as we're putting things together,\nthey might not be the exact piece we need.\n\n57\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.315\nOr again, we might have\na wrong parameter set in here.\n\n58\n00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:42.010\nAnyway it might be telling\nyou it's an error, and\n\n59\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.240\nit's not actually an error at all.\n\n60\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.470\nSo let's look what Preflighting does for\nus.\n\n61\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.770\nSo I can turn it on.\n\n62\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.650\nIt's on by default.\n\n63\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.200\nYou can turn that off though if it does\nseem to be slowing down you processor\n\n64\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.190\nspeed at all.\n\n65\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.510\nBut on by default, and\n\n66\n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.230\nit's going to keep checking\neverything you're putting in there.\n\n67\n00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.620\nAnd it's going to do that by\nthe profile that you tell it to use.\n\n68\n00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.050\nAnd basic working is\nthe one that's built in,\n\n69\n00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.630\nso it's whatever perimeters Adobe has set.\n\n70\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.770\nSo you're probably going to wanna\nchange those depending on what it is\n\n71\n00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.080\nyour document is that you're working on.\n\n72\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.400\nSo I have a couple that are here by\ndefault, or that I've created and\n\n73\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.322\nput in here in addition\nto the default one.\n\n74\n00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:18.870\nI'm on that's called high\nresolution print, one that's called\n\n75\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.150\ndigital publishing, one that I didn't give\na very good name, new Preflight profile.\n\n76\n00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.320\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsay high-res print, and\n\n77\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.500\nI'm just going to turn on to see\nif we get any other results.\n\n78\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.150\nLets assume that this thing that we\nhave setup, this cover that we have\n\n79\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.150\nis going to be printed on an offset press\nand we need it to be high resolution.\n\n80\n00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.250\nSo when we look at what makes up that\nhigh resolution profile in a minute.\n\n81\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.380\nBut right now let's just\nturn it on see what happens.\n\n82\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.200\nIt's checking and it says,\nthere's an error.\n\n83\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.030\nSo, this is what the live Preflight does.\n\n84\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.300\nAs I put things in and\nI make changes and I put it in there and\n\n85\n00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.330\nit falls outside the parameters that\nI've set, it tells me I have a problem.\n\n86\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.300\nSo let's look at what that problem is and\n\n87\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.160\nthen we'll look at why it\nmight not be a problem at all.\n\n88\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.980\nSo when it tells you you have an issue,\n\n89\n00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.710\nall your errors will be listed\nhere in the center field.\n\n90\n00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.580\nIf I click on the disclosure triangle, it\ntells me that there is a style override.\n\n91\n00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.240\nWhen we looked at styles,\nwe said we don't want any overrides.\n\n92\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.150\nWell I set into this profile,\nto make sure it looked for that.\n\n93\n00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.480\nYou can tell it to ignore that,\n\n94\n00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.020\nI wanted to make sure I didn't\nhave any style overrides.\n\n95\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.990\nI can drill down one more time, and\nsee what that style override is and\n\n96\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.130\nwhere it lives.\n\n97\n00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.810\nSo right now, I can click and\nsee that it says safari.\n\n98\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.510\nI have six characters for whatever reason.\n\n99\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.410\nThat text has an override.\n\n100\n00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.970\nBut it has this blue one,\nand that's a hyperlink.\n\n101\n00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.650\nAnd that means when I click on it,\nit will actually jump to and\n\n102\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.710\nselect the object that is outside\nof the parameters I've set.\n\n103\n00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.190\nSo now it's up to me to fix it.\n\n104\n00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.770\nNow we might have a fix for it,\ndown in this info box at the bottom.\n\n105\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.590\nIt tells me that text has local formatting\nthat conflicts with the style definition.\n\n106\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.680\nIt does tell me which paragraph\nstyle is the issue and\n\n107\n00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.720\nit just says click the clear overrides\nbutton in the paragraph styles panel\n\n108\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.460\nthat might not be the actual\nsolution I wanna do.\n\n109\n00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.730\nSo again, it's up to me to say,\nokay what's wrong with that?\n\n110\n00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.670\nWell, let's go look.\n\n111\n00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.980\nAnd the we go to the paragraph\nstyles panel and\n\n112\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.070\nit tells me that there is a override to\nthat quotes, a paradox style that's there.\n\n113\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.440\nThat probably wasn't even\nthe one I wanted quotes.\n\n114\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.990\nIt probably was something\nthat I copied and pasted and\n\n115\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.300\nthat style came along with it.\n\n116\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.150\nSo I have options.\n\n117\n00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.370\nI can either do what it said, which was\nto option or I'll click on the quotes.\n\n118\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.900\nWhen I do that, it went away.\n\n119\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.080\nAnd that's because the quotes\nis really teeny-tiny text.\n\n120\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.730\nI'm gonna undo that.\n\n121\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.930\nWhat I probably want to do, I notice I\nhave no other styles in this document,\n\n122\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.840\njust the quotes, I probably need to\ncreate a whole new style from there.\n\n123\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.330\nSo, if you've seen the styles episode,\n\n124\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.410\nyou'll see that you can create one\nbased on text that I have selected.\n\n125\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.830\nThat's what I would do at this point.\n\n126\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.930\nSo I'm gonna fix it in\nwhatever way I need to.\n\n127\n00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.800\nSome of the things we might run into are\nimages that are way too low resolution.\n\n128\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.610\nSo lets actually do that.\n\n129\n00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.520\nI'm gonna throw another one into it,\n\n130\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.960\nbecause I know this is a high\nresolution print profile that I setup.\n\n131\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.570\nSo one of the things I've\nprobably told it to look for\n\n132\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.390\nis high resolution images, right?\n\n133\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.460\nSo let's actually take one of\nthese images that we have,\n\n134\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.490\nand I'm gonna go into the links panel.\n\n135\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.770\nAnd you can see if you've gone\nthrough the other episodes,\n\n136\n00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.760\nyou can see that everything here,\nwe're taking all the knowledge that we've\n\n137\n00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.210\nlearned along the way, and\nfiguring out how to fix it.\n\n138\n00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.060\nAnd hopefully we don't wait till we're at\nthe point where we're ready to export or\n\n139\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.560\npackage it, or we're on deadline\nbefore we start seeing these images.\n\n140\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.010\nSo, even if we didn't place an image in\nbefore we go to the links panel to check\n\n141\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.950\nit, if live Preflight is running,\nwe can always keep an eye on it that way.\n\n142\n00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.200\nI don't necessarily keep\nit running all day long.\n\n143\n00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.950\nI might, if I'm working on a big job,\nI might run it once or twice a day.\n\n144\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.030\nJust turn it on.\n\n145\n00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.150\nSo that it isn't right as I'm ready to go\nto export it and the client is waiting for\n\n146\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.430\nit that I find my issue.\n\n147\n00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.550\nI can find it at least\nby the end of the day.\n\n148\n00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.930\nEven if it's not a constant thing,\n\n149\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.420\nI'm not always looking down\nthere to see what errors I have.\n\n150\n00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.300\nBut at the end of the day or\n\n151\n00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.980\ntwice a day like I said, I might look at\nit and make sure what where my issues.\n\n152\n00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.040\nSo in this case,\nlet's take this item here and\n\n153\n00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.190\nit says that it is actually\n261 effective resolution.\n\n154\n00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.470\nWell 261 is kind of low so,\n\n155\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.160\nI must have given myself a little\nbit of leeway in this profile.\n\n156\n00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.550\nMaybe I said it had to be at least 250.\n\n157\n00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.120\nAnd we'll look at that\nlike I say in a second.\n\n158\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.320\nBut let's make that, I'm gonna\nincrease the size of this photo so\n\n159\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.040\nthat as I do that my effective\nresolution goes down.\n\n160\n00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.440\nGoes down to 140.\n\n161\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.320\nWhen I did that,\n\n162\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.490\nnow I go back over the Preflight and\nI can see I've got another error.\n\n163\n00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.000\nAnd that is this image.\n\n164\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.530\nSo, scroll down or drill down to that.\n\n165\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.320\nIt says there's a problem\nwith image resolution.\n\n166\n00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.940\nI drill down again and it says the\nElephants.jpg file on page 1 is a problem.\n\n167\n00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.870\nSo again when I click on it, it's gonna\ntell you what you can do with that.\n\n168\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.720\nWell, usually what you can do\nwith it is change the size and\n\n169\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.480\nif you can't do that, you might have\nto put a whole new photo in there.\n\n170\n00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.937\nOr go back to Photoshop and see if you\ncan crop it a little differently or\n\n171\n00:07:47.937 --> 00:07:51.056\nwhatever it is you need to do, but\nyou need to fix that some way.\n\n172\n00:07:51.056 --> 00:07:53.470\nIt does tell me it's only 140 ppi and\n\n173\n00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.555\nthat is outside of\nthe parameters that I've set.\n\n174\n00:07:56.555 --> 00:07:59.595\nSo let's actually look at\nthe parameters that we have set for\n\n175\n00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:01.095\nthis high resolution print.\n\n176\n00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:04.498\nTo do that we're gonna go\nover to the Panel menu, so\n\n177\n00:08:04.498 --> 00:08:09.380\nthe preflight Panel menu and\ncome down to Define Profiles.\n\n178\n00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.430\nSo we do that we have the different\nprofiles set up that we have here.\n\n179\n00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.807\nSo these are ones we have set up,\n\n180\n00:08:13.807 --> 00:08:16.006\nwe can also create a new one\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n181\n00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:19.150\nJust do + and we'll add in a whole\nnew profile for ourselves here.\n\n182\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.570\nSo I'm going to look at this high\nresolution print and see what we have.\n\n183\n00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.040\nNow some of the items have little lines\nthrough them, little dashes in them.\n\n184\n00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.600\nThat means that there're some\nthings that it's looking for\n\n185\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.420\ninside this particular category.\n\n186\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.113\nI generally just scroll down\neverything and just look and\n\n187\n00:08:36.113 --> 00:08:39.600\nsay okay in links there are a few\nthings that is looking for.\n\n188\n00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.050\nI want it to flag if there is a missing or\nmodified link.\n\n189\n00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.780\nSo again, this is something we\ncan see in the links panel.\n\n190\n00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.690\nBut if we don't look it\nover as we're working and\n\n191\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.980\nwe realize oops there was one\nthat was missing or modified.\n\n192\n00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.710\nAnd actually they added something\na couple of versions back.\n\n193\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.070\nSo that on the frame itself,\nthere's a little question mark or a little\n\n194\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.250\nexclamation point that actually appears\non the frame if it's missing or modified.\n\n195\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.480\nWe don't even need to go\nin the links panel anymore.\n\n196\n00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.610\nBut here it tells us, links missing or\nmodified, please let me know.\n\n197\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.190\nIf there are inaccessible URL links, so\nyou can have hyperlinks in your document.\n\n198\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.610\nIf you're going to export it to PDF for\n\n199\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.550\ninstance you can have a document\nthat has navigation in it.\n\n200\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.440\nYou click on an arrow and it jumps\nto the next page and the next page.\n\n201\n00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.540\nOr it clicks on a URL and\nit goes out to that website.\n\n202\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.760\nWell it constantly checks that to make\nsure that that URL is also working.\n\n203\n00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.790\nSo if it's not,\n\n204\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.470\nif it hits one of those instead of having\nto see it in the hyperlinks panel.\n\n205\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.260\nThis is basically keeping you from having\nto open all the individual panels and\n\n206\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.280\nkeep an eye on all of those.\n\n207\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.100\nSo this tells you as you go along,\n\n208\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.980\nyou've done something that\nis outside the parameters.\n\n209\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.000\nSo again,\nif that's not something you need,\n\n210\n00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.310\nif I'm going to high resolution print,\nI probably don't care about URLs.\n\n211\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.440\nI'm not going to print them\nbecause I'm gonna print it.\n\n212\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.720\nYou can't click on a piece of paper and\njump to a URL.\n\n213\n00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.140\nSo that's probably not even\na thing I need to worry about.\n\n214\n00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.970\nI can deselect that.\n\n215\n00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.710\nDown in color, I have things\nlike transparency blend space so\n\n216\n00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.030\nyou have to have that assigned or maybe\nyou can say color space is not allowed.\n\n217\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.910\nWell if you're going to CMYK,\nmaybe you tell it RGB is not allowed.\n\n218\n00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.190\nSo I can select that and then tell\nit I don't want any lab color and\n\n219\n00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.220\nI don't want any spot color as well.\n\n220\n00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.000\nNow for me, I'm not going to do that RGB.\n\n221\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.890\nBecause, and I tend to keep that on but\nit's one of those ones that I ignore.\n\n222\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.840\nBecause I can place things, and actually\nthis is one of the best ways to work is\n\n223\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.530\nplace RGB images if you have them in RGB.\n\n224\n00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.640\nSo you've downloaded stock photos or\n\n225\n00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.080\nyou've taken something on your\ndigital camera, those are RGB.\n\n226\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.460\nPlace those as RGB in InDesign,\ndon't worry about going to Photoshop and\n\n227\n00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.960\nchanging them to CMYK,\nyou want to work in RGB.\n\n228\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.400\nWhen you print this or\nwhen you export it to PDF especially,\n\n229\n00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.500\nyou tell it to convert the image\nfrom RGB to CMYK at that point.\n\n230\n00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.480\nIt's going to use the same engine that\nPhotoshop would use back in the beginning.\n\n231\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.240\nBut if you change it in Photoshop and\n\n232\n00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.950\nthen you need to do some more color\nwork on it or somebody else does.\n\n233\n00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.190\nThey wanna work in RGB and\nyou switch it back to RGB.\n\n234\n00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.560\nAnd then back to CMYK and\n\n235\n00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.730\neach time you switch it you're getting\ncolor shifts that you can't even manage.\n\n236\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.880\nSo for me and for most people,\n\n237\n00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.950\nwe keep it in a RGB workflow\nuntil the very last moment.\n\n238\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.660\nCuz then we can convert it at the end, and\nit all converts using the same engine, and\n\n239\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.930\neverything is beautiful.\n\n240\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.460\nSo I may or may not tell it not allowed.\n\n241\n00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.470\nSo it might flag an RGB image.\n\n242\n00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.720\nSo I often keep this turned on so\nI can see I have RGB images\n\n243\n00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.530\nthat I might need to keep an eye on but\nit's not a bad thing.\n\n244\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.140\nWhat I would love for the preflight\nto have instead of just red and\n\n245\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.890\ngreen is also a yellow.\n\n246\n00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:42.390\nEspecially when i'm working with other\npeople on this because I want to say yes,\n\n247\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.480\nI'm aware those are RGB images.\n\n248\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.870\nAnd I'd like the person I hand it off to,\nif I'm working with another designer.\n\n249\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.890\nTo know that I'm aware that there\nare RGB images but Erica says it okay,\n\n250\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:52.860\nthat kind of thing.\n\n251\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.600\nSo I could maybe check it off and\nsay that.\n\n252\n00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.540\nSo right now it's a yes or no, it's a red\nor green kind of thing, stop or go.\n\n253\n00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.970\nSo for me, I might turn it on and\nthen I know well I've got 20 RGB images.\n\n254\n00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.480\nI'm gonna have at least 20 errors.\n\n255\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.940\nBut I can always check the screen and make\nsure that there are just those images, and\n\n256\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.550\njust the fact that they're RGB.\n\n257\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.210\nSo again, how you need to work and\nwhat your output needs are,\n\n258\n00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.490\nthis is something your going to\nhave to think about for yourself.\n\n259\n00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:22.710\nI can tell it that there's no spot color\nallowed, if over printing is allowed, so\n\n260\n00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.060\nthere's a lot of stuff under color.\n\n261\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.140\nSo again,\nyou have to know what's acceptable for\n\n262\n00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.430\nthe output that you plan to put\nthis device or this document to.\n\n263\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.390\nImages and objects,\nthis is a huge one, image resolution..\n\n264\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.320\nSo this is the one that we just demoed.\n\n265\n00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.660\nImage resolution if you care about\nthe resolution, which you should,\n\n266\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.990\nyou need to make sure you have\na high enough resolution for\n\n267\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.600\nthe output that you're going too.\n\n268\n00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.310\nThan you need to tell it\nhere what's acceptable.\n\n269\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.940\nSo, under Image Resolution and\n\n270\n00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.820\nwhenever we talk about images whether\nwe're printing or we're exporting to PDF.\n\n271\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.420\nThey separate it out between color, gray\nscale and they call it one bit imaging or\n\n272\n00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.982\nbit mac imaging, and\nthat is like line drawings.\n\n273\n00:12:59.982 --> 00:13:03.010\nRight, so if you drew it with\na Sharpie and you scanned it and\n\n274\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:08.000\nthat line drawing, or you created it\nwith any raster line drawing imaging.\n\n275\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.910\nNot vector, but raster.\n\n276\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.365\nThen, what does that need to do?\n\n277\n00:13:11.365 --> 00:13:15.310\nThat tends to have a higher resolution.\n\n278\n00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.820\nSo for instance if we go back to printing,\nprinting has this magical number of 300.\n\n279\n00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.794\nAnd 300 is the magical number of\nwhat your resolution needs to be for\n\n280\n00:13:24.794 --> 00:13:26.829\na printing press, 300.\n\n281\n00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:30.760\nIt varies from printer to printer but\njust keep 300 sort of in your head.\n\n282\n00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.650\nAnd so that would be whether\nit's a color image or black and\n\n283\n00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.970\nwhite or gray scale image.\n\n284\n00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.530\nI'm sorry,\na gray scale image not black and white.\n\n285\n00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.030\nBlack and white you've got on or\noff, that's that one bit.\n\n286\n00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.450\nAnd the one bit imaging tends to be 1200,\nso that's four times the amount, so\n\n287\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.700\njust keep those numbers in mind.\n\n288\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.260\nAgain, if you working with a print shop,\n\n289\n00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.640\nthey're gonna tell you what's\nacceptable and what you need.\n\n290\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.960\nOr at least they should.\n\n291\n00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.290\nSo going back to the profile,\nunder Image Resolution,\n\n292\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.040\nI need to set a minimum resolution.\n\n293\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.110\nI can set a maximum as well.\n\n294\n00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.460\nI never do that because\nInDesign's smart enough to say,\n\n295\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.010\nokay she needs 300 because that's\nwhat we're gonna output to, is 300.\n\n296\n00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.060\nWhether it's an export or\na print 300s what we're going for.\n\n297\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.060\nNow this image is 6400 so it's huge.\n\n298\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.510\nWell InDesign's smart enough to go\nthe output device can only handle 300.\n\n299\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.650\nI only requested 300 that's\nall that's going to be sent.\n\n300\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.270\nSo, it's got the information there,\nbut when it exports or when it prints,\n\n301\n00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.070\nwhen it does that\nconversion it changes down.\n\n302\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.760\nSo the maximum not a big issue for\nme at least.\n\n303\n00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.177\nYou may have different needs.\n\n304\n00:14:31.177 --> 00:14:34.137\nSo color image minimum resolution 250.\n\n305\n00:14:34.137 --> 00:14:36.278\nSo I told you that magic number was 300.\n\n306\n00:14:36.278 --> 00:14:38.710\n250 might be a little low.\n\n307\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.160\n280, 275 is usually what I put because\nmaybe it’s not that noticeable.\n\n308\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.440\nIf its 280 it might be slightly fuzzy,\nbut only to the most disterning of eyes.\n\n309\n00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.510\nSo just decide what your minimum is,\nfor color, and for the gray scale, and\n\n310\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.660\nfor the one bit,\nI put 800 as my minimum here.\n\n311\n00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.010\nIf something's not proportionately scaled,\nthat might be something.\n\n312\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.200\nSo again, what is it that you need for\nyour end piece?\n\n313\n00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.540\nIf there's indirect developments,\n\n314\n00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.250\nI probably want to know\nthat they're in there.\n\n315\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.500\nBecause, if I'm printing this, especially,\nthis is for high resolution print.\n\n316\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.700\nI might want to know that I put something\ninteractive in there, that of course isn't\n\n317\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.136\ngoing to be interactive [LAUGH]\nwhen it's on a piece of paper.\n\n318\n00:15:16.136 --> 00:15:20.600\nUnder Text > Overset text, so if we have\ntext that ran outside the text frame.\n\n319\n00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.990\nWe might wanna know that, sometimes I have\nthat, I've just shortened up the frame\n\n320\n00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.580\nto make it disappear, I didn't want it\nactually delete those last two paragraphs,\n\n321\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.890\nI just want to hide them.\n\n322\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.050\nBut I would like that flag so\nI can go and check and\n\n323\n00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:35.170\nmake sure that wasn't something that\naccidentally fell outside the text frame.\n\n324\n00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.570\nIf missing glifs,\nmissing fonts is important,\n\n325\n00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:41.180\nthere is those paragraph style and\ncharacter style overrides.\n\n326\n00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.430\nSo again,\nanything that you think is important.\n\n327\n00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.150\nLet's look at Document.\n\n328\n00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.386\nIf you want blank pages, if you wanna make\nsure that you don't have blank pages or\n\n329\n00:15:49.386 --> 00:15:52.518\nthat it alerts you if you have\nblank pages, you can do that.\n\n330\n00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:55.136\nMake sure you have enough bleed and\nslug to work with,\n\n331\n00:15:55.136 --> 00:15:57.534\nanything that fits in\nthat particular profile.\n\n332\n00:15:57.534 --> 00:15:59.553\nSo I just made some changes to that,\nI'm gonna say Save.\n\n333\n00:15:59.553 --> 00:16:02.913\nSo that high resolution print\nchanged a little bit and let's see,\n\n334\n00:16:02.913 --> 00:16:05.680\nwe actually ended up with\nanother error because of it.\n\n335\n00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.390\nSo color, color space not allowed,\nhere's those RGBs.\n\n336\n00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.060\nI can click on each one and\nI come down here to the bottom and\n\n337\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.100\nit says content uses RGB.\n\n338\n00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.860\nSo the fix for that,\nedit the source file, obviously.\n\n339\n00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.370\nBut I just wanna make sure, and I can look\nat each one and go yep, it says it's RGB.\n\n340\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.720\nThat's where I would a love a yellow and\n\n341\n00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.040\ngo I know they're there but it's fine,\nlet's move on with it and keep it.\n\n342\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.940\nSo again,\nit's going to constantly tell you that,\n\n343\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.390\neven when it's sitting down here at\nthe bottom it's gonna turn red or\n\n344\n00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.219\ngreen, depending on what it is\nyou've put into your document.\n\n345\n00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.320\nAnd do one other one, digital publishing,\nwe'll just look at that.\n\n346\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.860\nDefine profiles, and we're gonna go\nlook at the digital publishing and\n\n347\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.930\nI've got some different things.\n\n348\n00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:46.161\nFor instance the images, let's go up here\nto images and I've got them set at 150.\n\n349\n00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:50.039\nSo 150 is fine, maybe this is\nactually a proof, usually, for\n\n350\n00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:53.390\ndigital now I'm using 250 to 300 anyway.\n\n351\n00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:58.030\nMostly because a lot of people are reading\nthem on iPads and other tablets the iPad\n\n352\n00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:03.870\nretina display actually has a resolution\nof 256 which is almost the same as print.\n\n353\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.170\nSo for me if I don't have interactivity\nin my PDF, they're either going to print\n\n354\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.987\nthe PDF or they’re going to look at\nthe PDF on a iPad and on retina probably.\n\n355\n00:17:12.987 --> 00:17:15.830\nThen I'm gonna do one document\nbecause there's not much difference in\n\n356\n00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:18.120\nthe resolution,\nI'll just make sure it is all 300.\n\n357\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.370\nIt'll be a little bigger than it\nneeds to on the PDF for the iPad but\n\n358\n00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:28.290\nit's not huge, unless I have like a coffee\ntable book with tons of photography in it,\n\n359\n00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.472\nthen I'm not going to worry about\nhaving it be slightly bigger.\n\n360\n00:17:31.472 --> 00:17:36.445\nAnd the whole point of a PDF is to get as\nmuch information as you can into that PDF,\n\n361\n00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:39.503\nin the smallest,\nmost portable document size.\n\n362\n00:17:39.503 --> 00:17:43.437\nAnd that's what the PD in PDF stands for,\nPortable Document, right, so\n\n363\n00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:46.990\nyou want to make sure that it's\nsmall enough to fit on a device, but\n\n364\n00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.660\nit also has all\nthe information that you need.\n\n365\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.709\nSo again, I would have different\nsettings for each of those.\n\n366\n00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:58.090\nI can also come in here and I can tell\nit which pages to use which profile for.\n\n367\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.790\nSo maybe page one is going high\nresolution because it's a cover and\n\n368\n00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.950\nit's in full color.\n\n369\n00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.490\nSo I might say for page one, so\nI click down here and and put page one and\n\n370\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.190\nI want it to run with\nthe high resolution print.\n\n371\n00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.700\nAll right, and\n\n372\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.710\nthat's where I have those five images,\nall I have in here is the cover.\n\n373\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.330\nBut I might say, okay, then page two,\nif I had another page two or\n\n374\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:20.200\nif I'm using alternate layouts I\nwill also have those to choose from.\n\n375\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.930\nSo again in alternate layouts if that's\nsomething you want to look into,\n\n376\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.610\nI could have my high resolution version\nI'm printing on a printing press.\n\n377\n00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:33.070\nAnd I'm also having a lower resolution\nversion that I'm gonna make into a PDF for\n\n378\n00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.680\npeople to download from my website.\n\n379\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:40.080\nI can have those in the same document\nwhich is helpful because I can\n\n380\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.820\nmaintain one document, obviously.\n\n381\n00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.870\nAnd also when you use alternate layouts,\nif I make editorial change in the first\n\n382\n00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.640\none, all the other ones that\nare based on that also change.\n\n383\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.040\nSo I change a word,\nit changes across the board.\n\n384\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.230\nSo look into that, if that's something you\nneed, and in this case with preflighting,\n\n385\n00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.710\nI can tell it preflight the printed\nversion using the high res print.\n\n386\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.240\nChose the other layout,\nwhich I don't have any other layouts but\n\n387\n00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.280\nthis is where it would be, and use the PDF\nlayout, use the digital version for that.\n\n388\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.160\nSo I'm checking against the parameters for\nwhere it's actually ending up.\n\n389\n00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.950\nSo, preflight, super great to have.\n\n390\n00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:15.910\nIf you're working and\n\n391\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.760\nactually moving around, preflight\nis not working in the background,\n\n392\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.330\nit's just if you stop moving your mouse,\nthen it starts checking.\n\n393\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.330\nAgain, you can turn that off completely so\nit's not doing it constantly for you but\n\n394\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.810\nthen that way you know if\neverything is ready to go.\n\n395\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.280\nLet's say you have a green light or\n\n396\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.260\nyou know that the errors that you have are\nnot actually errors just little flags that\n\n397\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.690\nyou want to keep track of, now you're\nready to do something with that.\n\n398\n00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.790\nSo you can either print it which we talked\nabout in a previous episode or maybe we're\n\n399\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.970\nsending it off to somebody and they're\ngoing to print it from the InDesign file.\n\n400\n00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.340\nNow I don't do this as often anymore,\n\n401\n00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.550\nmostly I send a PDF file but there are\nplenty of times where someone needs that.\n\n402\n00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:55.110\nOr maybe you've been working on it and\nyou need to package it up and\n\n403\n00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.410\nsend to somebody else to work on,\nyou've done your part on it but\n\n404\n00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.400\nyou need to send everything with it.\n\n405\n00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.330\nSo the reason we have to package\nit is one of the things we looked\n\n406\n00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.900\nat when we placed images or\npretty much anything but\n\n407\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.100\ntext inside our documents\nis that it created a link.\n\n408\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.360\nIt just told InDesign this is\nwhere this graphic lives but\n\n409\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.480\nI didn't actually put the whole\ngraphic inside there.\n\n410\n00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.200\nSo when I put the image\nof this elephant inside,\n\n411\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.870\nI didn't actually put\nthe whole image inside there.\n\n412\n00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.100\nI put the placeholder image in there and\n\n413\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.100\nit told InDesign where that\nactually lives on my hard drive.\n\n414\n00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.451\nWhen I send that to somebody else,\nif I don't send them that image with it,\n\n415\n00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:34.643\nthen they're going to have just have\nthe screen resolution version and\n\n416\n00:20:34.643 --> 00:20:37.938\nif they go to export it or print it\ntheir preflight is gonna scream at them,\n\n417\n00:20:37.938 --> 00:20:41.410\nhey this is only 72 dpi and you're\nlike I used the high resolution one.\n\n418\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.950\nWell, if you didn't send the high\nresolution version out with it\n\n419\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.180\nthey can't do it and\nthat's what packaging does.\n\n420\n00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.020\nSo that you don't have to go and\ngrab the InDesign file,\n\n421\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.900\nand grab the fonts, and grab the images,\nand grab the PDF, and text, and\n\n422\n00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.510\neverything you used, InDesign can do that\nfor you through a thing called packaging.\n\n423\n00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.040\nI also use this internally.\n\n424\n00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.550\nSo for me, I might start working on\na job and it's on my desktop and then I\n\n425\n00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:08.150\ngrab some things off the internet, I've\ngot, go get our logo off of our website.\n\n426\n00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.100\nOkay, good, I wouldn't actually just pull\nit off the website, they've actually got\n\n427\n00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.570\nthe nice graphic, high resolution graphic\nfiles sitting on their website somewhere.\n\n428\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.930\nGreat I download that, and I download some\nstock photography and I have some already\n\n429\n00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.430\nin a folder on my desktop so\nthey come from all these different places.\n\n430\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.730\nNow I've got them all over and\nI need to just sort of organize myself and\n\n431\n00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:30.220\nknow that I have it in a nice folder\ncalled ABC Client, whatever, or\n\n432\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.060\nwe'll do Wild Travel Cover, right?\n\n433\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.420\nSo we got the photography cover here and\nwe want to put that in a folder and\n\n434\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.510\nI want to know that I have all the images\nand everything that I need for that.\n\n435\n00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.010\nI need to package that.\n\n436\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.310\nSo I'll do that, I'll package it up and\n\n437\n00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.140\nthen I have that nice folder\nwhere everything lives together.\n\n438\n00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.600\nSo I'm actually gonna show you,\nactually let's jump out and show you,\n\n439\n00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.760\nI have an actual folder that's in here,\nfor the wild one.\n\n440\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.250\nSo in this wild photo book that's here,\nI have, oops,\n\n441\n00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.680\nI guess I don't have the,\nI will actually package it up,\n\n442\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.620\ncuz I thought I had it actually\nseparated out from a package.\n\n443\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.090\nI may have pulled the bits\nof the package all apart but\n\n444\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.090\nwe're gonna create one anyway.\n\n445\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.430\nSo we'll do it from this one that we have,\nwe're gonna fix this elephant.\n\n446\n00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.920\nDon't like that he's hanging out there,\n\n447\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.970\nwe're gonna put him back where he belongs,\nlooks pretty good.\n\n448\n00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.400\nWe'll shorten him up and\nwe say okay, we're ready with this,\n\n449\n00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.170\nwe're ready to send it off to a printer\nwho wants our InDesign files or\n\n450\n00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.950\nto someone else on our team who needs\nall the InDesign files as well.\n\n451\n00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.640\nSo let's package everything up,\nunder the FIle Menu,\n\n452\n00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.550\nwe'll come out to Package and\nit's gonna ask you,\n\n453\n00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.920\nit's gonna give you some warnings, it will\nalways tell you that you have RGB images.\n\n454\n00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.610\nSo it's just gonna tell you that, again\nthat's not an issue, don't worry about it.\n\n455\n00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.680\nSo I'm gonna look under fonts, I also\nhave chosen down here at the bottom,\n\n456\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.890\nShow Problems Only.\n\n457\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.560\nSo if it's not a problem,\ndon't show it to me, I don't care.\n\n458\n00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.110\nSo obviously there's nothing here, I have\nno problems with my fonts and I'm gonna\n\n459\n00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.190\ntalk a little bit about fonts in just\na second in this whole packaging of fonts.\n\n460\n00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.120\nRight now, I'm gonna assume,\n\n461\n00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.380\nI'm sending it, just moving it,\nsomewhere else on my desktop.\n\n462\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.070\nSo it says there's no problem with that.\n\n463\n00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:05.800\nLinks and images, I can come in here and\nsee what the names of each one are.\n\n464\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.040\nThe type of color space,\nthat's where it's flagging it and\n\n465\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.930\ntelling me these are RGB images.\n\n466\n00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.960\nWhat pages they're on, they're linked,\nwhich is good, they're not embedded, and\n\n467\n00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.260\nI have no color profile assigned, and\nwe didn't talk about color profiles.\n\n468\n00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.820\nBut I can just go ahead and see,\nand it only shows me the problems,\n\n469\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:24.050\nlike it says It's RGB, it thinks that's\na problem, I'm going to ignore that.\n\n470\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.340\nColors and inks,\nnot gonna worry about these at all.\n\n471\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.270\nThe print setting, this just shows\nwhat the last print settings we used\n\n472\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.270\non this document, I never use that either.\n\n473\n00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.510\nAnd external plugins, usually not\na problem at all, t his just shows plugins\n\n474\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.320\nthat I have that may or\nmay not have been used in this document.\n\n475\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.968\nI call this the iffy box, because I never\nknow why it shows me that I have a recipe\n\n476\n00:23:42.968 --> 00:23:46.085\nwizard plug-in, I certainly\ndidn't use that in this document.\n\n477\n00:23:46.085 --> 00:23:48.080\nBut what we need to\nworry about is package.\n\n478\n00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.229\nSo we just make sure everything's good,\npackage needs to be saved.\n\n479\n00:23:51.229 --> 00:23:54.599\nGreat lets save it, it's gonna save it to\nthe desktop and it's gonna ask you for\n\n480\n00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:55.716\nprinting instructions.\n\n481\n00:23:55.716 --> 00:23:57.871\nThis is where you can put\nin all your information,\n\n482\n00:23:57.871 --> 00:24:00.452\nonce you put it in there it's\nthere every time you package.\n\n483\n00:24:00.452 --> 00:24:04.053\nAnd you can also put individual\ninstructions for this particular document.\n\n484\n00:24:04.053 --> 00:24:06.940\nTheoretically, this is so\npeople at print shops will read this.\n\n485\n00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.040\nI know from working in a lot of print\nshops, a lot of people don't read them.\n\n486\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.760\nBut I like to have it so that I have\nnotes to myself, if nothing else.\n\n487\n00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.288\nIt keeps track of what fonts you used,\nwhat images you used,\n\n488\n00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:19.758\nwhat colors are used, things like that,\nthings that might be handy down the road,\n\n489\n00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:22.800\nand it puts it in the folder that\nwe're creating, this package folder.\n\n490\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.840\nSo now we need to choose where this goes.\n\n491\n00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.560\nI'm just gonna put this\nout on the desktop.\n\n492\n00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.020\nIt takes the name of the document and\nadds Folder to it.\n\n493\n00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.660\nAnd we've got a couple different options\nwe need to worry about here, Copy Fonts,\n\n494\n00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:39.660\nexcept for CJK, that's Cyrillic, Japanese\nand Korean, and also Typekit fonts.\n\n495\n00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.180\nSo it won't take any of your Typekit\nfonts that you used and package them up.\n\n496\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.970\nBut if we're sending it to someone\nelse who has Creative Cloud\n\n497\n00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.060\nthey have access to the Typekit and\n\n498\n00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.860\nthey're gonna sync it through their\nown Creative Cloud subscription.\n\n499\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.120\nSo we don't need to worry about\nputting it in the package.\n\n500\n00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.280\nSo let me talk a little bit about putting\nfonts in the package while we're copying\n\n501\n00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.550\nthe fonts.\n\n502\n00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.430\nLegally most font licenses\nthat you have do not\n\n503\n00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.700\nallow you to actually\ndistribute the fonts.\n\n504\n00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.181\nSo that means, even if I'm sending\nthis to my printer at a print shop,\n\n505\n00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:06.370\nI am packaging that up.\n\n506\n00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.120\nIf I send the fonts with them,\nI am violating the terms,\n\n507\n00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.380\nmost likely, of my font licensing.\n\n508\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.100\nThat being said, every printer would\nhave to have every font known to man,\n\n509\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.400\nand this is something people\nhave been doing for a long time.\n\n510\n00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.350\nGenerally speaking, most printers will\ntake those fonts, and they have systems in\n\n511\n00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:26.270\nplace so that they only turn on the font\nthat you gave them for your job,\n\n512\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.350\nstill probably outside the licensing\nboundary, but that's kind of how it works.\n\n513\n00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.450\nSo I always joke about the font police,\nbut it really is no joke,\n\n514\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:33.615\nit is a licensing.\n\n515\n00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:35.930\nI'm gonna let you do with that\nwhat you need to do with that, but\n\n516\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.820\njust know that you can't be\ndistributing those, most likely.\n\n517\n00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.730\nBut it does let you put it in there.\n\n518\n00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.830\nIf I'm doing this for\nmy own use, which I said I was,\n\n519\n00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:46.270\nI'm going to move this all to\nthe desktop and just reorganize it.\n\n520\n00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.580\nI like that all the fonts\ncome with it as well.\n\n521\n00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.830\nI can also copy the link to graphics.\n\n522\n00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.850\nThat's super important.\n\n523\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.600\nThat's one of the reasons\nthat we're packaging this up,\n\n524\n00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.310\nis that I have all these linked\ngraphics I placed in there.\n\n525\n00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.950\nI would like a copy of them put in a\nfolder that is right next to the InDesign\n\n526\n00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.490\nfile so that I know it's all together\nin this neat little package.\n\n527\n00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.620\nThat's the whole point.\n\n528\n00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.260\nIf I'm sending this out to print\nthen I definitely need that copy of\n\n529\n00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:13.210\nthe link graphics, and also update\nthe graphic links in the package.\n\n530\n00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.310\nIf you don't do that, let's say I did it\nand didn't select that update and I send\n\n531\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:21.210\nit to a printer, he has the links and\nthat's great, but when he opens the Links\n\n532\n00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:25.710\npanel it's gonna say that they're either\nmissing or modified, probably missing, and\n\n533\n00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:30.550\nthen he's gonna have to to go and relink\neach of those graphics individually.\n\n534\n00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.220\nSo he's gonna have to do\na little bit extra work.\n\n535\n00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.640\nIf you say update it, it automatically\nsays, it's in this new folder,\n\n536\n00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.890\nin this folder that we're sending.\n\n537\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.060\nThat's where the links go and\nit re-does all the path names for that.\n\n538\n00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.110\nSo that's something we wanna do.\n\n539\n00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.000\nAnd the last one is to include fonts and\n\n540\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.990\nlinks from hidden and\nnon-printing content.\n\n541\n00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.420\nIt may be that you're sending a little\nbit of extra information, but for\n\n542\n00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.760\nme I might have a hidden layer.\n\n543\n00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.818\nI forgot I hid it, I actually needed it.\n\n544\n00:26:52.818 --> 00:26:55.570\nEspecially like when the one where\nwe turned on the layers on and\n\n545\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:56.840\noff in a previous episode.\n\n546\n00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.440\nWe had three different layers,\nturned each one on and off.\n\n547\n00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.800\nWell, I probably left the last one turned\non, but I need all those images from those\n\n548\n00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.640\nhidden layers to also go with the package,\nso I tend to leave that on.\n\n549\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.730\nThe last two options in\nthe packaging document, or\n\n550\n00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:14.870\ndial up box, is include IDML, and\nthat’s an InDesign Markup Language.\n\n551\n00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:19.160\nSo you might see an .idml file as\nwell,and basically what that is is\n\n552\n00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.070\na backwards compatibility feature.\n\n553\n00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.140\nSo if I have that and\nI send it to them and\n\n554\n00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:28.210\nthey only have InDesign CC 2014\nthey can open that IDML file.\n\n555\n00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:32.080\nSo it's not just the InDesign file, but\nthis IDML file that can be opened in\n\n556\n00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.400\nearlier versions, only a few\nversions back, but they can do that.\n\n557\n00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.070\nNow there might be special things I used\nin InDesign that might cause some issues,\n\n558\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.080\nso keep that in mind.\n\n559\n00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.290\nBut I have that there, and\nalso it's just a nice, kind of,\n\n560\n00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.300\nbackup of the same file in there.\n\n561\n00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.880\nAnd I can also include a PDF print\nincluding whatever preset I decide for\n\n562\n00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.870\nmy PDF to do there.\n\n563\n00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.983\nSo I might just have one.\n\n564\n00:27:52.983 --> 00:27:54.720\nI have one usually that's for proofing.\n\n565\n00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.990\nSo I might say here's one for\nproofs so that they have a nice PDF of\n\n566\n00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.710\nwhat it should look like when\nthey open the InDesign file.\n\n567\n00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.040\nMake sure that all the fonts loaded,\nall the images are there, and\n\n568\n00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.110\nit looks exactly like it did in that PDF.\n\n569\n00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.790\nWhen we're done with that\nwe just say Package and\n\n570\n00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.020\nit's going to give you a little\nwarning from the font police.\n\n571\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.230\nYou may read it if you want.\n\n572\n00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.810\nIt's really long,\n\n573\n00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.230\nit basically says, you probably don't\nhave permission to send that font.\n\n574\n00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.320\nJust say, OK, do with it what you will.\n\n575\n00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.350\nI'm gonna jump out and\njump out to the desktop.\n\n576\n00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.290\nLet's see how long that actually takes,\nwe may just jump out.\n\n577\n00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.460\nI'm gonna have a folder that's here,\nit's still working so\n\n578\n00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.240\nI'm not gonna click on anything inside\ncuz it's still doing its thing.\n\n579\n00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.510\nBut I can see that\nthere's my InDesign file.\n\n580\n00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.310\nI did not click the IDML file,\nyou would see that in there as well.\n\n581\n00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.710\nThere's the PDF I said to send,\nhere's the Instructions text.\n\n582\n00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.170\nLet me jump back to InDesign and\nmake sure we're actually actually done.\n\n583\n00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.040\nI don't wanna click on anything.\n\n584\n00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.380\nAll right, so I come over here and I also\nhave my Links, there's all the Images that\n\n585\n00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.980\nwere inside that Document\nnicely linked to this folder.\n\n586\n00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.500\nHere's the Instruction file.\n\n587\n00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.400\nSo I look at that I can see all the files\nthat we used when we printed it and\n\n588\n00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.800\nalso the document fonts that\nI used inside that document.\n\n589\n00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.300\nSo when I send this I can go ahead and zip\nthat up and put it into a nice compressed\n\n590\n00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:09.250\nlittle package and send that off to the\nprinter to use and they can open it up and\n\n591\n00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.690\nthey've got everything they need\nto output that file from InDesign.\n\n592\n00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.640\n>> Erica, lot of great information\non pre-flighted packaging.\n\n593\n00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.930\nWe thank you for the wealth of knowledge.\n\n594\n00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.710\nIt just look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode but\n\n595\n00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:22.580\nbefore before we do, do you have any\nadditional advice you would like to say?\n\n596\n00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.630\n>> Just make sure you have everything\nyou need when you send it off to print.\n\n597\n00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.310\n>> Alright, we appreciate you being\nhere with us, and we appreciate you,\n\n598\n00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.050\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n599\n00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.110\nSigning out

00:00:15.940\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.235\nin today's episode we're coming back at\nyou with more Adobe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:22.971\nThat's right, diving back into InDesign.\n\n6\n00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:25.496\nAnd joining me in the studios today\nis Erica Gamet, Erica how you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:26.294\n>> Fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:30.510\n>> All right, so we have been going\nthrough a long journey within InDesign,\n\n9\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.811\nwhat is our next stop?\n\n10\n00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:32.856\n>> We're going to export.\n\n11\n00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:33.882\n>> All right, very good.\n\n12\n00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:37.205\n>> So we're gonna export to\na couple different file formats,\n\n13\n00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:40.071\nthe biggest most major one\nbeing exporting to PDF.\n\n14\n00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:43.433\nAnd we've actually got two flavors\nof PDF that we're gonna export to,\n\n15\n00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:46.810\nthen we're gonna export to a couple\nother file format options as well.\n\n16\n00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.890\nBut they all start in the same place,\nback in our InDesign file.\n\n17\n00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.250\nAnd we actually have this page laid out,\nthis cover.\n\n18\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.600\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and export it.\n\n19\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.270\nSo the first thing we wanna do\nis get to the Export dialog box.\n\n20\n00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.290\nSo we can either do a Cmd or\nCtrl+E for export.\n\n21\n00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.750\nAnd we can go up to the File menu,\nand choose Export.\n\n22\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.017\nAnd then we decide where we\nwanna export that to first,\n\n23\n00:01:08.017 --> 00:01:11.701\nbefore we tell what we're exporting as or\nputting in any of our options.\n\n24\n00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.441\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nhit Cmd or Ctrl+D to jump to my desktop.\n\n25\n00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.532\nAnd I'm gonna choose the format down here,\nand\n\n26\n00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:19.580\nwe've got several\ndifferent to choose from.\n\n27\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.327\nWe're only gonna talk about a few,\nand like I said,\n\n28\n00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:24.581\nthe first one being Adobe PDF, and Print.\n\n29\n00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:25.850\nIt's just Print in there.\n\n30\n00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.450\nWe've got two different flavors of PDF.\n\n31\n00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.710\nWe've got Print and Interactive, so\n\n32\n00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.570\nwe're gonna start with the print one\nbecause we're gonna lead off from\n\n33\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.300\na previous episode, where were\ntalking about printing and exporting.\n\n34\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.100\nSo we're gonna do the same sort of\nthing where we were printing it to our\n\n35\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.160\ninkjet printer or\n\n36\n00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.775\nwe were packaging it up to send to\na printer to print from our InDesign file.\n\n37\n00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:48.676\nBut where you're probably going to\nsend files to a print shop to be\n\n38\n00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:50.350\noutput is to a PDF.\n\n39\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.860\nNow you may also do a PDF\nas your final piece.\n\n40\n00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.340\nIt might be something that's\ngoing to be read on a tablet or\n\n41\n00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.120\neven on a desktop, in a browser.\n\n42\n00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.290\nIt might be something that you put up\non your website, a PDF is ubiquitous.\n\n43\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.080\nIt's everywhere and\nit's a portable document format.\n\n44\n00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.210\nThat's what it stands for\n\n45\n00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.080\nand the whole thing is that we have\neverything that we need inside this PDF.\n\n46\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.990\nWe don't need external links,\nwe don't need external text,\n\n47\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.400\nwe don't need anything else.\n\n48\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.960\nIt's all in this little\nportable job file format.\n\n49\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.580\nAnd it has like I said,\neverything we need, and\n\n50\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.915\nit looks like we expect it to look,\nif we do our magic correctly.\n\n51\n00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:31.025\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsay Adobe PDF Print as our file format.\n\n52\n00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.334\nIt gives us the PDF extension of course.\n\n53\n00:02:33.334 --> 00:02:36.270\nEven if you're doing an interactive PDF,\nit still gives you that PDF.\n\n54\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.800\nIt's just we have different options\nto put in in this dialog box.\n\n55\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.914\nSo I'm gonna click Save, and I get a lot\nof options that look very familiar to\n\n56\n00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:45.730\nthe print dialogue box options.\n\n57\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.115\nSo some of those we're gonna skip over,\nbecause they're pretty much the same, and\n\n58\n00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:51.390\nI'll indicate which ones those are.\n\n59\n00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.149\nLike a lot of the other\ndialog boxes in InDesign,\n\n60\n00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.244\none of our first choices is a Preset.\n\n61\n00:02:56.244 --> 00:02:59.976\nSo this is something we've seen through\nall the episodes that after we put in\n\n62\n00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:02.030\na lot of this information in a dialog box.\n\n63\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.796\nWhether it's a new document or\nprinting or PDF, we can save that so\n\n64\n00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:09.810\nwe don't have to put in all this\ninformation over and over again.\n\n65\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.690\nWe have consistency and\nwe have a streamlined workflow as well.\n\n66\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.480\nSo we'll come back to\nthat at the very end,\n\n67\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.720\nwhen we actually put in the information,\nand save the present.\n\n68\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.490\nNext time we come, we can just choose from\nour long list of presets that are here.\n\n69\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.996\nSo the first thing when we're exporting to\na PDF, it ask us if we have a standard.\n\n70\n00:03:27.996 --> 00:03:31.147\nNow there are a couple of PDF standards,\nand the reason for\n\n71\n00:03:31.147 --> 00:03:35.197\nthis is that if you have a workflow that\neverything has to fit the standard or\n\n72\n00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:39.721\nthe printer has one you need to make sure\nthat you're fitting one of this standard.\n\n73\n00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:43.082\nThe other thing is by having a standard\nyou don't have to chose a lot\n\n74\n00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:45.555\nof the options they're all ready there for\nyou.\n\n75\n00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:50.940\nAnd if you're sending let's say to a\nprinter nad use say the PDF/X-1a standard.\n\n76\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.660\nAnd that's just a printing standard\nthat's been around for a long time.\n\n77\n00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.061\nYou can use one of the newer\nones which is the 2003.\n\n78\n00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:58.469\nI still pretty much use the 2001,\n\n79\n00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:02.090\nit basically lets them know\nthey can just check that PDF.\n\n80\n00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.580\nThey don't have to open it and\nlook at all the images, and\n\n81\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.030\nall the text and everything.\n\n82\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.840\nThey know that if you've told\nthem it's a PDF/X-1a, and\n\n83\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.280\nwe've done everything here in the standard\nstill gets tagged as a standard.\n\n84\n00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.475\nThey can just use a piece of software to\nlook at the PDF that you've given them,\n\n85\n00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:18.586\nand it says yes, it's a PDF/X-1a.\n\n86\n00:04:18.586 --> 00:04:19.926\nThey know that's print ready.\n\n87\n00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.332\nThat's ready to be printed\non an offset printer.\n\n88\n00:04:22.332 --> 00:04:24.407\nAnd they can just take that and\nsend it back to the press.\n\n89\n00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:29.060\nYou might chop two days off your\nproduction time by doing that as well.\n\n90\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.430\nNow for me, I don't generally choose\nthe standard from the pull down menu.\n\n91\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.480\nI choose one of the PDF presets that's\nhere by default when you get InDesign.\n\n92\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.490\nSo the ones that are in brackets are the\nones that came with the application.\n\n93\n00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.810\nSo I'm gonna choose PDF/X-1a\nas my standard to start with.\n\n94\n00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.800\nWhen I do that,\nthe standard item changes here.\n\n95\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.950\nWhat I want to make sure is,\n\n96\n00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.600\nif I know that my PDF/X-1a is the standard\nI want, there are a few things I\n\n97\n00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.890\ncan change without making it fall\noutside that standard perimeter.\n\n98\n00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.770\nI wanna make sure that this\nnever ends up saying None.\n\n99\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.730\nIf it says None, it means I changed\nsomething I wasn't supposed to, and\n\n100\n00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.590\nit now no longer fits that standard.\n\n101\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.090\nSo we'll start with that, we may\nactually change that as we go along with\n\n102\n00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.400\nthe different options we\nhave in this dialog box.\n\n103\n00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.050\nAlso Compatibility, so the Compatibility\nchanged when I choose the PDF/X-1a.\n\n104\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.320\nAnd it changed to Acrobat 4 which is\nreally old, because they had version 11,\n\n105\n00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.280\nand now they're on Acrobat DC,\nso document cloud.\n\n106\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.090\nSo that actually changed,\nthe numbering changed.\n\n107\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.670\nBut so they're basically\ntheoretically on version 12,\n\n108\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.840\nso version 4 sounds really old.\n\n109\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.270\nSo what does version 4,\nwhy do we have that as that standard?\n\n110\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.976\nWell you can see the standard\nis kinda of old it's 2001.\n\n111\n00:05:37.976 --> 00:05:41.610\nAnd so that been a while but\nwhat that does is it basically,\n\n112\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.511\nthe first thing it does\nis it flattens it down.\n\n113\n00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:48.764\nSo that all that transparency that we\nlooked when working in drop shadow and\n\n114\n00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:50.732\neffects and other transparency.\n\n115\n00:05:50.732 --> 00:05:54.160\nAnd we looked at transparency\nissues in a previous episode.\n\n116\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.000\nThis says,\nI want to flatten that right now.\n\n117\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.076\nSo one of the issues that we might\nhave with transparency is if we send\n\n118\n00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:04.951\nthe transparency still\nas live transparency.\n\n119\n00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:08.861\nSo that would be above acrobat version 4,\nanything higher than that still has\n\n120\n00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:12.250\ntransparency in it and\nat some point that has to be flattened.\n\n121\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.167\nWhile I'm letting them flatten it maybe\nthey're gonna flatten it on their\n\n122\n00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:15.731\nrip machine.\n\n123\n00:06:15.731 --> 00:06:19.506\nThe Raster image processor\nmachine that they use to send,\n\n124\n00:06:19.506 --> 00:06:23.370\nto play to negatives,\nwhatever they need to to print that.\n\n125\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.040\nAnd then I don't know\nwhat their software is.\n\n126\n00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.260\nTheir software might be old then it might\nsay that's a beautiful drop shadow,\n\n127\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.250\nhere's your solid box cuz\nthat's what happens a lot.\n\n128\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.639\nBut if I do it here, I know that when I\nsee the resulting PDF, if it looks like\n\n129\n00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.268\na nice soft drop shadow, that's exactly\nwhat I'm gonna get on the other end.\n\n130\n00:06:40.268 --> 00:06:44.386\nBecause the transparency has been\nflattened by the engine built in to\n\n131\n00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:45.240\nInDesign.\n\n132\n00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.068\nSo for me, that's almost always what I do.\n\n133\n00:06:48.068 --> 00:06:51.900\nThere may be a reason that I wanna send it\nwith transparency in tact to someone else.\n\n134\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.919\nIt might be that I've\nworked with them before,\n\n135\n00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.856\nI know their equipment can handle it,\nbut for the most part I do this.\n\n136\n00:06:56.856 --> 00:06:59.850\nI also do this if I don't\nknow who's printing it.\n\n137\n00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.230\nI do a lot of ads for\na ski resort company and\n\n138\n00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.681\nit goes to magazines all over the country.\n\n139\n00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:07.220\nAnd I don't know who's\nactually printing it,\n\n140\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.760\nso this is a great,\nI call it the lowest common denominator.\n\n141\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.450\nI can send it out there and\nI know that it's going to be flattened and\n\n142\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.900\nit's also going to be in CMYK already.\n\n143\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.814\nSo even if I have those RGB images that\nhave been in my document that I like.\n\n144\n00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:23.736\nI know that when I save it as a PDF/X-1a,\n\n145\n00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:27.396\nit's going to convert those\nimages from RGB to CMYK.\n\n146\n00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:30.496\nAnd I know that that's already\nbuilt into that standard so\n\n147\n00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:31.959\nit is a printing standard.\n\n148\n00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:33.369\nIf you are going to export this, and\n\n149\n00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.630\nit's going to be something we\nare gonna read on tablets.\n\n150\n00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.930\nWe are probably not going to use that.\n\n151\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.540\nWe can absolutely keep it unflattened\nbecause it is gonna be right on a device.\n\n152\n00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.767\nWe don't need to worry about it.\n\n153\n00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:46.992\nIf I think that people might download\nit or print it to their inkjet printer,\n\n154\n00:07:46.992 --> 00:07:48.719\ntheir $29 inkjet printer.\n\n155\n00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:53.096\nI might wanna flatten it because I don't\nwannna assume that they can take that PDF.\n\n156\n00:07:53.096 --> 00:07:55.204\nAnd either their computer's\nflattening it or\n\n157\n00:07:55.204 --> 00:07:58.420\nthe software in their printer is\nactually trying to flatten it.\n\n158\n00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.480\nSo I might think, that looked beautiful,\nand then everybody distributes it and\n\n159\n00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.733\nthinks, that was the ugliest\nnewsletter I've ever seen.\n\n160\n00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.774\nBecause it doesn't have\nthose great drop-shadows or\n\n161\n00:08:05.774 --> 00:08:07.335\nwhatever transparency that I've used.\n\n162\n00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:11.008\nSo, it's just the way to control it, and\nknow that when I get the PDF out of this,\n\n163\n00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:14.170\nI can already look and see if I\nhave any issues with transparency.\n\n164\n00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.030\nThat's the big one for that.\n\n165\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.545\nAlso, If you tell a printer,\nyou say, can you take a PDFX1A?\n\n166\n00:08:19.545 --> 00:08:22.300\nThey're gonna be mighty impressed\nthat you know what a PDF X1A is,\n\n167\n00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.140\nand they're gonna say yes, because,\nlike I said, that's a printing standard.\n\n168\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.630\nAnd it gives you a description\nhere of the preset that you use.\n\n169\n00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.160\nI rarely ever read that.\n\n170\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.770\nIt's a lot of information that\ndoesn't really pertain to me,\n\n171\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.480\njust learn the ones that we need for\nthe preset.\n\n172\n00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.630\nDown here,\n\n173\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.860\nwe've got a lot of things that look\nexactly the same as the print dialog box.\n\n174\n00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.360\nSo we've got what pages do we want.\n\n175\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.260\nWhat range do we want to print, and\nspreads, and also the layout view.\n\n176\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.970\nSo we can actually choose how we want\nthe PDF to be viewed when they open it.\n\n177\n00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.970\nSo I can do single page.\n\n178\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.910\nNow I'm doing single page PDF, so\nif I've done an eight page document,\n\n179\n00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.560\nit's gonna be eight single pages.\n\n180\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.040\nBut I can tell it to do Single Page\nContinuous, which means as you scroll,\n\n181\n00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.860\nit can scroll through the half page, or\nI can tell a single page which means that\n\n182\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.310\nas they hit the up and down arrow key,\na whole page comes into focus.\n\n183\n00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.420\nNow the thing is a lot of this stuff,\nI leave it on default, because the people\n\n184\n00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.610\non the other, end your reader, they\nactually have their preferences set up,\n\n185\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.740\nwhich override a lot of\nwhat you put in here.\n\n186\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.270\nI generally don't worry about that.\n\n187\n00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.450\nI can force them to open\nin full screen mode,\n\n188\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.510\nthat will actually\noverride what they've set.\n\n189\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.848\nThat can be scary to some people.\n\n190\n00:09:24.848 --> 00:09:27.662\nIf they double click on a PDF, and\nsuddenly it takes over their whole screen,\n\n191\n00:09:27.662 --> 00:09:30.041\nand they don't know how to escape\nout of that full screen mode, so\n\n192\n00:09:30.041 --> 00:09:31.530\nI tend to not do that either.\n\n193\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.980\nNow, depends who's reading this,\n\n194\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.210\nif you know your sending this\ninternally to all your sales reps.\n\n195\n00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.240\nYou can set it up because you wanted\nthem to have the same experience\n\n196\n00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.430\nacross the board.\n\n197\n00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.680\nAnd when we're working with digital files,\nif they're for\n\n198\n00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.140\ndigital consumption,\nyou have to realize that there's so\n\n199\n00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.750\nmany different flavors of PDF readers out\nthere, and that everybody's experience\n\n200\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.790\nwill be different based on\nthe preferences they have set.\n\n201\n00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.010\nIf you're going to print,\nthis is for print, then I'm\n\n202\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.220\nnot gonna worry about any of this because\nthey're just gonna open it, print it.\n\n203\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.140\nThey're not even gonna worry\nabout viewing it on the screen.\n\n204\n00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.490\nI can embed page thumbnails if\nI want just as so that when\n\n205\n00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.030\nthe person is looking at it in their PDF\nreader, we have thumbnails down the side,\n\n206\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.060\nso they can visually see what\neach of the pagees look like.\n\n207\n00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.650\nOptimized for\n\n208\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.780\nfast web view, this is something I\nrarely ever use if I'm doing this for\n\n209\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.478\noutput, because obviously I don't care\nif it's fast web view, it's a print PDF.\n\n210\n00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.930\nI can also choose to\nView PDF After Exporting, so\n\n211\n00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.560\nonce I make it here in InDesign it\nautomatically will launch whatever\n\n212\n00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.655\nI use as my PDF viewer so\nI can see it automatically.\n\n213\n00:10:30.655 --> 00:10:31.960\nYou can turn that on or\noff, that's just for\n\n214\n00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.090\nyourself, it has nothing to do with\nthe PDF, the PDF content itself.\n\n215\n00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.650\nAnd you can create a tagged PDF if\nyou've done shortcuts or rollovers for\n\n216\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.950\nthe visually impaired.\n\n217\n00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.890\nYou can go ahead and\nsay create tagged PDF so\n\n218\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.185\nthat those actually show up in the PDF\nwhen they have the reader turned on.\n\n219\n00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:47.475\nIf they roll over something it will\n\n220\n00:10:47.475 --> 00:10:49.245\ngive the description of\nthe image that you have.\n\n221\n00:10:49.245 --> 00:10:52.395\nIf you've built that image into your\ndocument, you need to go ahead and\n\n222\n00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:55.005\ntell it to save that\ntagged information there.\n\n223\n00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:58.140\nLayers, same as the print Print dialogue\nbox, do we want visible printable?\n\n224\n00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.410\nDo we want all of them or\njust the visible layers?\n\n225\n00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.030\nWe have a couple options\nthat are not available here.\n\n226\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.540\nThese are not available in a PDF X1A,\ncuz we're going to Acrobat 4,\n\n227\n00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.700\ncertain things that we don't have,\ncreate Acrobat layers.\n\n228\n00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.230\nIf we go to version five and\nup, sorry six and up,\n\n229\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.480\nlet go to six once I get six\nI can create acrobat layers.\n\n230\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.710\nSo as I changed it to five or\nsix though my standards went away.\n\n231\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.990\nSo that not gonna be good for\n\n232\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.370\nPDF X1A does seem modified now\ncuz I made some changes this.\n\n233\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.126\nLet's put this back to Acrobat 4, and,\nactually, now it got rid of everything.\n\n234\n00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:33.740\nI have to actually go back and tell it\nPDFX1A, let's put it back where we had it,\n\n235\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.280\nand I can choose to print\nthe non-printing objects if I want.\n\n236\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.960\nAnd this is gonna keep popping up for\nyou if you have not tried Publish online.\n\n237\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.680\nThe first time that you try it,\nit will go away.\n\n238\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.440\nIt just wants you to try their\nnew service and publish online.\n\n239\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.310\nSo you feel free to\ncheck that if you want.\n\n240\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.310\nJust ignore it if not.\n\n241\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.060\nThis is where the real\nmagic happens with a PDF.\n\n242\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.230\nThe whole point of a PDF, like I said,\nis to get it as portable as possible,\n\n243\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.600\nas small as possible, and as optimized as\npossible with as much information that you\n\n244\n00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.450\nneed to deliver the experience you\nhoped to with your finished piece.\n\n245\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.810\nAnd compression is where that happens.\n\n246\n00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.476\nThere is no resolution for a PDF.\n\n247\n00:12:10.476 --> 00:12:14.508\nIf someone asks you what resolution your\nPDF is, they don't know what they're\n\n248\n00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:18.310\ntalking about, cuz there is no actual\noverall resolution of the PDF.\n\n249\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.200\nThere is resolution for each of\nthe individual elements in your PDF,\n\n250\n00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.160\nand this is where you control it.\n\n251\n00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160\nSo, for instance, we placed a lot of\nimages, we made sure they released 300,\n\n252\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.850\nwe had live preflight on or\nwe checked the links panel, and\n\n253\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.260\nmake sure there were at least 300 PPI.\n\n254\n00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.515\nBut here we can tell it, actually, only\nsend them as 200 ppi, if we wanted to.\n\n255\n00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:39.284\nRight, so we have it set maybe for print.\n\n256\n00:12:39.284 --> 00:12:41.050\nWe do a print one at 300.\n\n257\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.284\nThen we're gonna do another one at 150,\njust a low resolution for\n\n258\n00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:46.320\nviewing on a phone or something like that.\n\n259\n00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.940\nSo I can choose that here.\n\n260\n00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.500\nSo, there's a lot of things to choose,\nbut here's the good thing.\n\n261\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.332\nWhatever the defaults are, make sure you\nremember what those are and keep those,\n\n262\n00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:57.398\nand I'll show you what they are,\nthey're the ones I have.\n\n263\n00:12:57.398 --> 00:12:59.100\nBicubic downsampling.\n\n264\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.300\nSo there's a lot of choices\nto choose from here.\n\n265\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.430\nThis basically says, Do Not Downsample,\nwhich means that if I had placed something\n\n266\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.680\nand placed it small, it's 2,400,\nand I placed it smaller, and\n\n267\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.910\nI ended up with 4,800 ppi, and\nI say Do Not Downsample, it's gonna take\n\n268\n00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:18.708\nthe entire 4,800 ppi resolution image and\ncram that into your PDF.\n\n269\n00:13:18.708 --> 00:13:22.010\nThat is gonna make a really huge PDF,\nespecially if you have several of those.\n\n270\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.430\nWe probably don't want that.\n\n271\n00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.270\nWe want to use one of the downsampling.\n\n272\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.850\nKeep it at Bicubic Downsampling.\n\n273\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.284\nIt's just the best one that's there,\ndon't worry about why,\n\n274\n00:13:30.284 --> 00:13:33.727\nI don't know why, just know that\nthat is the preferred option.\n\n275\n00:13:33.727 --> 00:13:36.801\nAnd it says Bicubic Downsampling to what?\n\n276\n00:13:36.801 --> 00:13:38.076\nWell, to 300.\n\n277\n00:13:38.076 --> 00:13:41.000\nAgain, let's assume we're going\nto this high resolution print.\n\n278\n00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.220\nWe're gonna base it on the PDFX1A,\nand we know it's going to printing.\n\n279\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.910\nSo 300 is that magic number.\n\n280\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:51.560\nI want 300 pixels per inch, or dots per\ninch, and it says for images above what?\n\n281\n00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.010\nWell, for me, I like it to be 300.\n\n282\n00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.370\nIf I get 301 pixel,\nI wanna squeeze out that last pixel.\n\n283\n00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.890\nAgain, we're trying to get\nit as portable as possible.\n\n284\n00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.440\nIt may or may not be an issue for you.\n\n285\n00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.180\nYou might say, okay,\n\n286\n00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.315\nwait till 400 which means you may have\na 400 dpi image in your document.\n\n287\n00:14:06.315 --> 00:14:09.270\nIf you have several images in your\ndocument, that could also make for\n\n288\n00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.550\na bigger, more bloated file, and\nthis is just for color images.\n\n289\n00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.470\nAgain, color, grayscale, and monochrome.\n\n290\n00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.990\nSo do that, leave the compression\nAutomatic, JPG, which\n\n291\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.490\nis a lossy format but it's automatic,\nand then Maximum, just have that set.\n\n292\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.740\nAnd again, these are the defaults,\njust leave them there, same thing for\n\n293\n00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.840\nthe grayscale images.\n\n294\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.100\nI'm gonna set that also at 300,\nyou can leave it at 450.\n\n295\n00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.580\nAs I'm doing that, I wanna keep checking\nand make sure I have not negated that\n\n296\n00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.420\nstandard here, and made that go away to\nnone, that's what I do not wanna see.\n\n297\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.670\nAnd let's do this to 1200 for\nimages above 1200 leave\n\n298\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:47.110\nthe compression to this CCITT group,\ncuz you know what that stands for.\n\n299\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.630\nI don't know what that stands for.\n\n300\n00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.560\nIt's basically a consortium that comes up\nwith these algorithms on what works best.\n\n301\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.400\nThe 4 is the one that everybody uses.\n\n302\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.990\nThe last two at the bottom though,\nCompressed Text and Line Art,\n\n303\n00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:04.030\nthis is gonna compress your texts and line\nart even further in a lossless format.\n\n304\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.060\nSo it's gonna squeeze out whatever else\nit can without any loss of resolution\n\n305\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.100\nor quality.\n\n306\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.770\nAnd Crop Image Data to Frames,\nthis is important if you say,\n\n307\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.540\nhave that large 6400 DPI image, right?\n\n308\n00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.670\nBut you're only using,\nlets say it's the Cactus flower,\n\n309\n00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.160\nI've used in one of the previous episodes.\n\n310\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.780\nI've got a cactus flower\non top of the cactus, and\n\n311\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.815\nmaybe I've crop the image to just\nshow the cactus or the flower.\n\n312\n00:15:23.815 --> 00:15:26.130\nThe rest of the cactus got trimmed out.\n\n313\n00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.410\nIf I don't have this selected, it's\ngoing to send the entire information for\n\n314\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.240\nthat image to the PDF.\n\n315\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.900\nWell, if I know I just need that\nlittle spot, just that little bit,\n\n316\n00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.640\nthen I might as well choose this, and\nit will only send the information\n\n317\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.550\nthat's showing through that frame\ninstead of the entire image.\n\n318\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.120\nAgain, it just cuts out more information.\n\n319\n00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.003\nJust know that that\ninformation can't be retrieved.\n\n320\n00:15:45.003 --> 00:15:47.858\nIf people get into the PDF,\nyour printer can go on to PDF and\n\n321\n00:15:47.858 --> 00:15:50.095\nmake some changes to if they want to.\n\n322\n00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:52.383\nBut you can't move that a little\nmore to show the cactus,\n\n323\n00:15:52.383 --> 00:15:53.869\nwell there's nothing to move over.\n\n324\n00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:57.088\nWe cropped it out in this point,\nyou have to go back and make a new pdf.\n\n325\n00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:59.562\nBut that's one way to chop\nout more information.\n\n326\n00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:01.602\nThis box is the box that I use most often,\n\n327\n00:16:01.602 --> 00:16:05.322\nand now of course I'm going to set it up\nonce though and save it to a preset so\n\n328\n00:16:05.322 --> 00:16:09.102\nwe don't have to do this every time, but\nthis is where we really make a lot of\n\n329\n00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:13.200\nconsiderations for what our PDF will look\nlike and how it will perform in the end.\n\n330\n00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.220\nUnder marks and\n\n331\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.830\nbleeds if you watched the printing\nepisode we actually talked about this..\n\n332\n00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.890\nCrop marks, I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo some crop marks maybe on this.\n\n333\n00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.940\nAnd also document bleed settings.\n\n334\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.360\nIf you have a document bleed\nset up by default it's off.\n\n335\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.660\nSo, it says, okay you have a bleed and\nthat's great and\n\n336\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.530\nyou pulled out your images to that bleed.\n\n337\n00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.820\nBut now I'm gonna not\nactually deliver any bleed.\n\n338\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.930\nI'm not gonna show anything that's\npast the edge of that document size.\n\n339\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.460\nWhich is weird, I use the bleed.\n\n340\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.260\nI probably wanna use it,\nso I need to select that.\n\n341\n00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.550\nAnd then it grays everything out.\n\n342\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.400\nIt says, use the document bleed setting,\nit's an eighth of an inch.\n\n343\n00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.650\nNow, you might have set up a quarter\nof an inch bleed and your printer says,\n\n344\n00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.450\nI only want an eighth of an inch.\n\n345\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.800\nAnd to fit it on the paper right, I really\nneed it to be an eighth of an inch.\n\n346\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.780\nSo even though you have a quarter of\nan inch, you can come in here and\n\n347\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.850\ntype in whatever value you want.\n\n348\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.140\nNow, if you type it bigger and your image\ndidn't actually get pulled out that far,\n\n349\n00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.370\nit's not gonna help you at all,\nbut keep that in mind.\n\n350\n00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.130\nUse Document Bleed Settings,\nyou may want to turn on.\n\n351\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.310\nOutput, now because I'm\nusing this PDF/X-1a,\n\n352\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.010\nI don't have to make any\ncolor Conversion whatsoever.\n\n353\n00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.120\nBut if I wasn't using that,\nI could convert it to something else, and\n\n354\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.080\nthat just basically talks about\nthe images that we have in there.\n\n355\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.870\nSo, I've been using RGB images throughout,\nI know on the preflight it told me,\n\n356\n00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:23.430\nhey you've got RGB images, and\n\n357\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.640\nI said don't worry about it,\nI'm gonna convert them to CMYK.\n\n358\n00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.800\nThis is where it happens, so by default,\nbecause I chose the PDF X!A, a standard.\n\n359\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.200\nIt's says convert to destination,\npreserve numbers.\n\n360\n00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.580\nThat just means all the values for\n\n361\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.410\nthe color that's in there, keep all\nthat information and convert it to CMYK.\n\n362\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.500\nSo the destination is this document CMYK.\n\n363\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.680\nI don't wanna change that.\n\n364\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.860\nCertain ones will let me change it and\nstill stay within that standard.\n\n365\n00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.670\nBut certain ones will say no,\nyou can't do that.\n\n366\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.340\nIf you change that,\nit no longer fits that profile.\n\n367\n00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.280\nSo leave that,\nbecause I've chosen the standard.\n\n368\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.830\nIf you haven't chosen the standard,\nyou'll need to choose Document CMYK or\n\n369\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.080\nDocument RGB if that's how you're going.\n\n370\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.780\nAnd, again,\na lot of this is fed into there from\n\n371\n00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.230\nthat the intent that we set when we\nvery first opened our new document,\n\n372\n00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.580\nwe said it's going CMYK, it says great,\nthere's Document CMYK, it also\n\n373\n00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.860\nmakes sure that when we use this standard,\nbut the preserved numbers is what we need.\n\n374\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.260\nWe can turn it to convert\nto destination and\n\n375\n00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.350\nit won't necessarily have\nthe same exact values.\n\n376\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.130\nOr I can say no color conversion.\n\n377\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.140\nWhat that's going to do is it's going\nto send RGB images out to my PDF.\n\n378\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.260\nProbably not what we want in this case\nif we're sending it out for printing.\n\n379\n00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.470\nPDFX1A, I'm not gonna change any\nof that either because again,\n\n380\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.560\nthat's part of the standard.\n\n381\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.900\nI don't wanna negate that standard.\n\n382\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.080\nSo I'm gonna leave that exactly as is.\n\n383\n00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.460\nAnd advanced, this is the last one\nthat we really have to worry about\n\n384\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.560\nis how much of the fonts\ngets put into that PDF?\n\n385\n00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.280\nSo in an earlier episode,\nI talked about fonts, and open type fonts.\n\n386\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.840\nThose are the best ones to use,\nthey can have up to 65,000 glyphs.\n\n387\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.540\nWell, I could accidentally embed\nthat entire font inside this PDF,\n\n388\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.280\nall 65,000 glyphs if it uses all of those.\n\n389\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.880\nThat's a lot of ont information\nespecially if I have 10 words on my PDF.\n\n390\n00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.450\nSo there's no need to send\nthat whole font file with it,\n\n391\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.690\nthat whole entire piece of software.\n\n392\n00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.960\nSo basically, you'd base it on what\npercentage of the font you use.\n\n393\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.670\nWhat percentage of the characters?\n\n394\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:21.830\nI don't know what percentage.\n\n395\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.060\nI know two percentages.\n\n396\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:23.930\nZero and 100%.\n\n397\n00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:29.060\nI either didn't use any of it, or I used\nall of it and everything else in between.\n\n398\n00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.570\nSo here's the only two\nvalues I ever put in here.\n\n399\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.810\n100% is on my default.\n\n400\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.040\nSo it says subset the fonts when\nthe percentage of characters\n\n401\n00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.760\nis used is less than 100%.\n\n402\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.520\nThat is probably the case.\n\n403\n00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.150\nI probably never used every\ncharacter that's in a font.\n\n404\n00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.650\nSo it will subset it.\n\n405\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.560\nThat means it only sends the letters and\ncharacters that I used in my document.\n\n406\n00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.930\nThose are the only ones that\nare getting embedded in there.\n\n407\n00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:56.760\nNow, where that might be an issue is if\nI say this thing is happening on May 22,\n\n408\n00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.940\nand I sent it.\n\n409\n00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.370\nAnd that's all that the text says.\n\n410\n00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:04.320\nJoin us on May 22, and the rest of the\ninformation is in a photo in Photoshop.\n\n411\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.430\nSo the only text that's there\nis join us on May 22nd.\n\n412\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.200\nAnd I send it off to the printer.\n\n413\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.880\nAnd then I realize that\nit was actually May 23rd.\n\n414\n00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.050\nAnd I tell the printer, go ahead and\nchange that to the 23rd.\n\n415\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.000\nWell, it can't, because there isn't a 3.\n\n416\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.630\nI did not subset the 3.\n\n417\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.390\nAll that went was what I needed\nto spell Join Us on May 22nd.\n\n418\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.990\nSo they can't just go in and change it.\n\n419\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.260\nThey would either have to already have\nthe font, which they may or may not have.\n\n420\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.860\nOr I'd need to remake the PDF.\n\n421\n00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.960\nSo that's the only time that I would\nactually change that to something else.\n\n422\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.030\nAnd if I did that,\nI would change that to zero.\n\n423\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.810\nAnd then it puts the entire font.\n\n424\n00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.950\nBecause I don't know where on\nthe spectrum the rest of that lies.\n\n425\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:42.330\nBut for the most part, as far as\nI'm concerned, I leave it at 100.\n\n426\n00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.000\nI don't want them to make that change.\n\n427\n00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.560\nBecause if they make the change on\nthe end of the PDF, my end design file\n\n428\n00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.940\nis still wrong, or I can change it and\nhope that my change matches their change.\n\n429\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.310\nI'd rather say, I tell you what,\n\n430\n00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.160\nI'm gonna resend you a new PDF\nwith that new information.\n\n431\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.560\nSo I keep that at 0 or at 100% so that\nit never puts that entire font in there.\n\n432\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.550\nIf you have 10 fonts and\nthey are all huge, it's gonna make for\n\n433\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.750\na really big fonts and blow PDFs\nmore than anything else practically.\n\n434\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.980\nAnother thing you really need to worry\nabout is the transparency flattener,\n\n435\n00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.340\nbecause on Acrobat 4 it's\nflattening that transparency.\n\n436\n00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:20.130\nYou have to tell it to what degree, what\nquality do we have of that flatterner.\n\n437\n00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.320\nSo by default it wants to\ndo the high resolution.\n\n438\n00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.230\nI have medium and\n\n439\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.770\nlow but then my transparent\nitems aren't gonna look as good.\n\n440\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.500\nMy drop shadows might look\na little chunky, things like that.\n\n441\n00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.060\nI also have high with outlines and\nhigh with text and strokes outlined.\n\n442\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.550\nSo I have one that I set up, and\nyou can create those, back in here,\n\n443\n00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.950\nI'm gonna actually cancel all of this,\nand come down to the edit menu, and\n\n444\n00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:44.310\ndo transparency flattener presets,\nI can actually recreate ones\n\n445\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.856\nbased on other ones and put in those\noptions like the high with outlines.\n\n446\n00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:51.420\nAnd what that high with outlines does\nis it takes any text so that I have.\n\n447\n00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.630\nI'm just gonna save this back\nto the desktop where we were.\n\n448\n00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:58.600\nIt will take any text that you have and\noutline it so\n\n449\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.860\nyou don't have any font issues.\n\n450\n00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.350\nYou don't even have to include fonts.\n\n451\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.490\nYou don't have to worry about any font\nproblems because you're gonna change it to\n\n452\n00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.370\noutlines and it's gonna look the same but\nit's not editable text.\n\n453\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.900\nBut it's only going to do that in\nthe PDF it creates, your text and\n\n454\n00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.530\nyour in design file is\nstill editable text.\n\n455\n00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.970\nSo let's get back to where\nwe were in advanced here.\n\n456\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.460\nSo I wanna choice either high resolution,\nif I'm going to output.\n\n457\n00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.940\nNow if I know that this is gonna be read\non the screen, I might be okay with medium\n\n458\n00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.110\nresolution, but\nbecause we're working with the PDF X1A,\n\n459\n00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.432\nI'm pretty sure we're\ngoing to print with this.\n\n460\n00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:34.050\nAll right so choose that may be high\nwith outlines just in case some printer\n\n461\n00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.750\ninsist that you outline all your fonts.\n\n462\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.890\nThis is a great way to outline them and\nwhat they have but\n\n463\n00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.060\nyou don't have to worry about beheading\noutline font in your actual InDesign file.\n\n464\n00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.070\nFrom there we got security\nyou can tell it that you need\n\n465\n00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:49.390\na password we can't do that with about\nfour words make little bit higher.\n\n466\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.940\nI can require password to open\nthe document I put that Password in here.\n\n467\n00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.770\nDon't forget it,\nthere's no way to retrieve it.\n\n468\n00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.460\nYou would have to recreate\nobviously a new PDF.\n\n469\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.360\nAnd you can also use a password to\nrestrict certain things like printing,\n\n470\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.470\nyou can only print in low resolution or\nyou can't print at all, and\n\n471\n00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.980\nalso you can enable certain\nthings like copying of text and\n\n472\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.480\nthings for accessibility on readers and\nthat's for the visually impaired.\n\n473\n00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.840\nSo that's just a way to add a little\nbit of extra security to your PDFs so\n\n474\n00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.050\npeople can't get in and\ndo whatever they need to with it.\n\n475\n00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.200\nSo we'll say export.\n\n476\n00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.290\nI wanna make sure I don't\nhave a password available.\n\n477\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.630\nI want to make sure that I\ndidn't set one accidentally.\n\n478\n00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.790\nAnd we'll come out here and\nwe save that to the desktop.\n\n479\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.190\nAnd here's our PDF.\n\n480\n00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.890\nWe double click on.\n\n481\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.850\nIt's gonna go ahead and\nopen it in whatever I have set for.\n\n482\n00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.320\nSo there we go, we have that.\n\n483\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.260\nI can come down here and\nsee what size it is.\n\n484\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:34.810\nIt's 8 1/2 by 11.\n\n485\n00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.180\nI did not redo the bleed\nwhen I redid that export.\n\n486\n00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.270\nI went ahead and I said,\nI have this bleed.\n\n487\n00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.600\nBut I can look and see,\nit says, it's 8 1/2 by 11.\n\n488\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.402\nWhere's that extra space for the bleed?\n\n489\n00:23:45.402 --> 00:23:47.981\nI did not have that checked\ninclude document bleed settings.\n\n490\n00:23:47.981 --> 00:23:51.332\nAll right, so\nlet's just back into InDesign.\n\n491\n00:23:51.332 --> 00:23:54.105\nWe're gonna export this out\nas an interactive PDF and\n\n492\n00:23:54.105 --> 00:23:56.266\nthen also as a couple other file formats.\n\n493\n00:23:56.266 --> 00:24:01.312\nSo do Cmd or Ctrl+E to export, and\nalso export that to the desktop but\n\n494\n00:24:01.312 --> 00:24:03.930\nI'm gonna call this interactive.\n\n495\n00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.310\nAnd I'm gonna choose Adobe PDF\ninteractive from here.\n\n496\n00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.780\nNow most of the settings are the same.\n\n497\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.960\nThere's a couple that are very\nspecific towards interactivity.\n\n498\n00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.560\nI'm gonna come down here and\nsay Say, obviously, all.\n\n499\n00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.590\nDo I want all the pages?\n\n500\n00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.750\nDo I want individual pages arranged,\nspreads?\n\n501\n00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.050\nThat's pretty much set by default.\n\n502\n00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.760\nHere's where you can choose\nwhat your viewing looks like.\n\n503\n00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.760\nWhether or not it's the default, you\nwant it to fit in page, items like that.\n\n504\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.390\nNow your version might look\na little bit different.\n\n505\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.800\nThis was in the latest version\nthat they switched it, so\n\n506\n00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.040\nit looks more like the other one\nwhere we've got individual panes.\n\n507\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.190\nIt's always been in one dialogue box\nsince the interactive PDF came to be.\n\n508\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.050\nThey used to always be\nin one all together.\n\n509\n00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:47.450\nThey split print and\ninteractive out recently, or\n\n510\n00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.890\nin the last few versions, and now the\nnewest version has these individual panes.\n\n511\n00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.330\nThey just had so much information\nthey started splitting it down again.\n\n512\n00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.730\nSo yours might look slightly different,\nbut I can choose what\n\n513\n00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.500\nI want it to look like when my end\nuser opens it up to look at it.\n\n514\n00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.530\nCuz keep in mind this is interactive,\n\n515\n00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:10.510\nthis is things like I might have placed\nmovies in here or sound files in there.\n\n516\n00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.510\nI might have things like navigation or\nroll overs.\n\n517\n00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.650\nWhen I roll over something and\nI want an image to pop-up.\n\n518\n00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.480\nSo, I am putting some\ninteractive elements in there.\n\n519\n00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.510\nSo, yes you can put things like movies,\nwhere is on a print PDF,\n\n520\n00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.010\nwe're gonna look at it, where gonna\nsee an image of those elements, boom.\n\n521\n00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.350\nBut maybe we make an interactive version,\nand that people are going to look\n\n522\n00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:35.230\nat maybe on an iPad, maybe on desktop,\nand there's a lot of considerations for\n\n523\n00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.470\nthat, which pdf they're going to look at,\nwhether or not it works.\n\n524\n00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.630\nSome things don't work on the tablets\nthat work on the desktop,\n\n525\n00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.470\nthat's a whole nother issues right there.\n\n526\n00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.640\nBut we can have those\ninteractive elements, but\n\n527\n00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.200\nwe have to export it to interactive pdf.\n\n528\n00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.620\nThe only interactive elements that you can\nhave in a print one were hyper links and\n\n529\n00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.350\nbook marks.\n\n530\n00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.150\nAnd that's just something and\nwe can't do that in an Acrobat 4 it\n\n531\n00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.430\nhas to be at least 5 or above for\nthose elements to be there.\n\n532\n00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:05.560\nAnd we have to manually check\nthose in the export dialogue box.\n\n533\n00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.720\nSo again,\nI can choose what to do with the layers,\n\n534\n00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.640\nthe tag PDF this all looks\npretty much the same.\n\n535\n00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:16.080\nAppearance only though is something I can\ndo instead of, including all the media and\n\n536\n00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.960\nforms, which is the interactivity which\nsays when I have a navigation button or\n\n537\n00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.540\na hyperlink, when I click on it it goes\nto the URL, or it goes to the next page.\n\n538\n00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.750\nI could say appearance only.\n\n539\n00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.570\nAnd that doesn't really help for the\ninteractive part, but it is a quick way to\n\n540\n00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:36.120\ntake the same pdf and export it as\na printed version, or a static version.\n\n541\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.550\nSo where there might be an image for,\nyou click on and there's a movie,\n\n542\n00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:43.550\nif you say Appearance only, all you gonna\nsee is the image and you click on it and\n\n543\n00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.790\nnothing's going to happen.\n\n544\n00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.330\nSo for doing interactive, we probably\nwanna include all, compression,\n\n545\n00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.650\nsame sort of idea but not nearly as many\n\n546\n00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.090\noptions to choose from because again\nthis is for an interactive one.\n\n547\n00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.880\nWe can either do it automatic or\nwe can choose JPEG quality, maybe maximum,\n\n548\n00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.910\nagain it's gonna make\nslightly higher files.\n\n549\n00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.610\nWe can also choose the resolution.\n\n550\n00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:06.250\nWe can put in our own custom resolution.\n\n551\n00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:10.950\n256 if we wanna do\nthe retina display advanced,\n\n552\n00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.340\nnot a lot to choose from, really.\n\n553\n00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.460\nYou can display whether or not you have\nthe document name or the file name or\n\n554\n00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.410\nthe document title, and also the same\npassword options that are there.\n\n555\n00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.360\nSo again there's not a lot of\ndifferent options except for\n\n556\n00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.970\nthe fact that you can choose\nwhat the resolution looks like.\n\n557\n00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.790\nAnd it's just slightly different options\nthan you would with the print one, and\n\n558\n00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:29.580\nwe export that.\n\n559\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.790\nSo any interactive elements\nthat are inside this document\n\n560\n00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.060\nwill now be available.\n\n561\n00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.920\nWe didn't put any in because we're\nnot really doing interactive PDF, but\n\n562\n00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.370\njust know there's two\ndifferent flavors of PDF.\n\n563\n00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.990\nWe jump back into InDesign and\nwe're gonna export it to a JPEG.\n\n564\n00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:45.320\nSo this is something you might need to do.\n\n565\n00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.830\nMaybe this is your book cover and\nyou've designed it, and when you print it,\n\n566\n00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.450\nyou make sure that there's a bleed.\n\n567\n00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.330\nWhen you print it or\n\n568\n00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:57.210\nwhen you send it to an interactive PDF you\nclick on the images and they play movies.\n\n569\n00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:02.110\nWell now we also want to send it out for\na book cover, file format, so\n\n570\n00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.460\nmaybe we're selling it on\nan online bookstore, or anywhere.\n\n571\n00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.840\nWe're putting it on our website and\n\n572\n00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.290\nwe say I want everybody to see\nwhat the cover looks like.\n\n573\n00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.910\nWell there's no need to\ngo out to Photoshop and\n\n574\n00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.570\ndo anything That I can\nsave this as a JPEG.\n\n575\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.160\ncommand Ctrl+E to export, we're gonna\nchoose JPEG from the pulldown menu,\n\n576\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.090\nagain it changes to the file format JPEG.\n\n577\n00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:26.850\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and save that and\nI didn't have a whole lot of options to\n\n578\n00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.420\nchoose from, because basically with\nthe JPEG, its set up tp size and\n\n579\n00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.030\nwhat resolution it is basically at.\n\n580\n00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:38.490\nPlugins that actually let you set instead\nof the size because we're working with\n\n581\n00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:43.110\nprint, but we're working with jpg's we\noften need to know the actual resolution,\n\n582\n00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.500\nthe pixel dimensions instead of\nyou know 4 by 6 or whatever.\n\n583\n00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.110\nWe need to know how many pixels are there.\n\n584\n00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.220\nSo there are some nice plugins and\nscripts that will let you do that as well,\n\n585\n00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.720\ngives you a little bit more options,\nwhich page,\n\n586\n00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.850\nif you want to print them in pages or\nspreads.\n\n587\n00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:59.670\nAgain, the quality of the jpg that\nyou have in there, it may be maximum.\n\n588\n00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:02.450\nIt may be not because if they're gonna\nput it on a bookstore like Amazon or\n\n589\n00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.570\nsomething like that it\nmight be really small, so\n\n590\n00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.219\nwhy make it maximum when it's\ngonna scrunch it down anyway.\n\n591\n00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.640\nI tend to leave this as baseline instead\nof progress that's just the way it\n\n592\n00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.190\nreads the jpg.\n\n593\n00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:16.800\nAgain the resolution the color\nspace by default it's set to r g b,\n\n594\n00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.230\nchance are you're going to\nview a jpg somewhere on line.\n\n595\n00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.370\nNot necessarily though you\nmight be taking that and\n\n596\n00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.960\nplopping it back into a flyer that\nyou're creating an in-design.\n\n597\n00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.530\nThat's gonna talk about all the great\nbooks that you have for sale.\n\n598\n00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.090\nWe're gonna put it all in one and\nwe're gonna print that out.\n\n599\n00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:32.920\nSo we might need that to be PCMYK.\n\n600\n00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.095\nSo again, we can choose color profiles.\n\n601\n00:29:36.095 --> 00:29:40.250\nAnti-alias is just going to\nmake smoother edges for you.\n\n602\n00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.260\nYou can choose\nUse Document Bleed Settings.\n\n603\n00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.600\nI'm not in this case because\nI want it to be 8.5 by 11.\n\n604\n00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.280\nI don't want the bleed.\n\n605\n00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.420\nThe bleed is there for print, so\nthat we Print it and trim it off.\n\n606\n00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.360\nThe bleed stuff should never be showing.\n\n607\n00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.960\nThen I can simulate overprint, which means\nif we have things like transparency and\n\n608\n00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.090\nitems, maybe we had the paper\ncolor set to a different color,\n\n609\n00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.650\nthat lighter blue of something.\n\n610\n00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.360\nIt's going to show how those colors\nwould actually overprint now.\n\n611\n00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.290\nWhy would I need that, probably wouldn't,\nunless I'm doing the JPEG as a proof.\n\n612\n00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.240\nMaybe somebody does not want a PDF proof.\n\n613\n00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.730\nThey want a JPEG proof.\n\n614\n00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.670\nSo I want to kind of give them a little\nbit more, to say this is what it\n\n615\n00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:21.280\nwill probably look like when we print that\non paper, export that out to the JPG.\n\n616\n00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.330\nSo we're gonna come out here and we've got\na PDF, we're got our interactive PDF which\n\n617\n00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:30.140\nlooks exactly the same and we've got\nour JPG sitting out there as well.\n\n618\n00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.070\nAll right, so we're gonna do one more.\n\n619\n00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:36.930\nWe're gonna export it to an IDML file and\nthe IDML file is sort of a special helper\n\n620\n00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.030\nfile, it's not something\nwe just Reader look at.\n\n621\n00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.840\nIt's something that we use either because\nwe wanna send it to an older version of\n\n622\n00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:49.380\nInDesign, or sometimes we use this if our\nfile gets a little corrupted for whatever\n\n623\n00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:54.100\nreason when we save that as and IDML\nfile and reopen it back into InDesign.\n\n624\n00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.190\nIt gets rid of all those weird\nthings that might be happening, and\n\n625\n00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.180\na lot of that is because\nInDesign is keeping track of\n\n626\n00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.540\neverything you're doing\nwhile you're working.\n\n627\n00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.420\nIn fact we've seen that\nwhen we open a file, let's\n\n628\n00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.780\nsee where that file actually is, I believe\nit's in here, we get this locked file.\n\n629\n00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.480\nActually let's open this one so\nI actually get a locked file for\n\n630\n00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.810\nit, jump back out here, and so as I do\nthat I get this locked File up here.\n\n631\n00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:20.420\nThis weird idlk, so in-design lock file.\n\n632\n00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.870\nAnytime I open a file,\n\n633\n00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:26.190\nI've got this secret file that shows up\nin the same folder while I have it open.\n\n634\n00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.880\nOnce I close it, it goes away and\n\n635\n00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.930\nthat's because it's keeping track\nof everything you're doing.\n\n636\n00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.000\nWell, it does keep track\nof everything you're doing,\n\n637\n00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.980\nwhich can become cumbersome and\nsometimes when things go wrong,\n\n638\n00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.320\nit keeps track of all that as well and\nit kinda just builds on itself.\n\n639\n00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.610\nSometimes when you get overwhelmed and\nthings aren't working,\n\n640\n00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.290\nstart working really funky in InDesign,\n\n641\n00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.900\none of the first things you can\ndo is export it to an idml file.\n\n642\n00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.570\nThose idml files,\nopen right back up in InDesign, or\n\n643\n00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:55.530\nmay be I've got 2015 and my friend has\n2014, and they are not ready to upgrade.\n\n644\n00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.070\nFor whatever reason they\ndon't wanna upgrade it and\n\n645\n00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.470\neverything is working perfectly,\nthey don't wanna jinx it\n\n646\n00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:04.300\nI can package this up as an IDML file and\nsend it to them and they can open it up.\n\n647\n00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.020\nIn fact you can open it\nup as far back as CS4.\n\n648\n00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.750\nNow there may be things that you put\nin here that don't look so well or\n\n649\n00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.740\ndon't translate well to the older version,\nand you certainly don't wanna send it\n\n650\n00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.370\nbackwards, have them make changes and\nsend it to you and you open it in 2015.\n\n651\n00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.290\nAnd then you send it back to them and\nthey open it in CS4.\n\n652\n00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:21.780\nThat is a recipe for\n\n653\n00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.560\ndisaster but there are plenty of\ntimes where you need to save that.\n\n654\n00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.280\nAnd sometimes I do that when I'm\ndistributing files to people and\n\n655\n00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.890\nI don't know what version they'll have.\n\n656\n00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.020\nI'll make the IBML file, and\n\n657\n00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.440\nthen I know pretty much any version that\nopens it will at least be able to read it.\n\n658\n00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.080\nThat's in the same, dialog,\nas everything else, command or control E.\n\n659\n00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.900\nExport, we're gonna choose IBML, and\n\n660\n00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:46.060\nit's the in-design mark-up language gives\nyou the IDML extension, I'll say save.\n\n661\n00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.880\nAnd basically that's all it does, it\ncomes up here this is what it looks like.\n\n662\n00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.400\nIt looks like the inter office mail\nthat you know you used to get when,\n\n663\n00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.360\nsay a sender between offices got\nthe little string on there and everything.\n\n664\n00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.080\nSo basically it just says we packaged it\nup in this little package for you to use.\n\n665\n00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.320\nSo that's an IDML File a little bit.\n\n666\n00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.850\nIt's not so much cross platform but it's,\nit's just something that we can use and\n\n667\n00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:10.520\nnot really be so concerned about what\nversion of InDesign the other user has.\n\n668\n00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.560\n>> Alright Erica, thank you very much for\nall the wealth of knowledge and\n\n669\n00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.320\nexporting but it does look like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n670\n00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.950\nBefore we do,\ngot any final words on Exporting.\n\n671\n00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.900\n>> On exporting, just again, know what\nit is that's happening in the end.\n\n672\n00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.850\nI know it's a theme, I've been there, and\noverall, just know that we only touched on\n\n673\n00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:32.750\na few things that are in, or a small\nsubset of things that InDesign can do, but\n\n674\n00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:36.540\njust know that you can always explore and\ntry out, and see what things InDesign can\n\n675\n00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.280\ndo for you, but always keeping in mind\nwhere that piece is ending up in the end.\n\n676\n00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.820\nWell, thank you for\nbeing here in the studio.\n\n677\n00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.110\nAnd thank you to the viewer watching.\n\n678\n00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.990\nSigning out for IT Pro TV,\nI I've been your host Wes Bryant.\n\n679\n00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.660\n>> And I'm Erica Gammitt.\n\n680\n00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.255\n>> And we'lll see you next time.\n\n681\n00:33:50.255 --> 00:33:57.370\n[SOUND]\n\n",
