So Docker is a new tool on\nthe scene that has made, well,\n\n7\n00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:23.471\nprovisioning these environments that\nwe need to use reproducibly, over and\n\n8\n00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:24.630\nover and over again.\n\n9\n00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.390\nWhether it be Red Hat, Linux,\nand it is standardized to Linux,\n\n10\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.020\nbut also applications contained\nwithin those environments.\n\n11\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.050\nIt just makes it really easy,\nmakes it fast, makes it reproducible, and\n\n12\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.890\nhas an entire tool set that allows us\nto manage all of those differences\n\n13\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.819\n&gt;&gt; Excellent,\n\n14\n00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:47.350\nnow obviously this is a type\nof cloud service I do believe.\n\n15\n00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.107\nAnd we're gonna have different people\nwanting to come in take a look at,\n\n16\n00:00:51.107 --> 00:00:54.534\nDocker that's very interesting, maybe\nthat's applicable for what I'm doing.\n\n17\n00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:58.019\nWhich lends us to the question of\nwho is the intended audience for\n\n18\n00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.932\nthis because it can't cover a wide scope,\ncorrect?\n\n19\n00:01:00.932 --> 00:01:04.930\n&gt;&gt; So the intended audience,\nlet me back up just for a moment.\n\n20\n00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.007\nThere are cloud components and\nit is used for\n\n21\n00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:09.655\nprovisioning cloud services\nthat's kind of the push.\n\n22\n00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:13.330\nBut the actual Docker tool will\nreside on your local machines.\n\n23\n00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.440\nso there's kind of a playoff there.\n\n24\n00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.270\nNow, as far as intended audience,\nthere is an assumption that you have basic\n\n25\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.840\nknowledge of Bash or\ncommand line type interactions, and\n\n26\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.070\nmost of our focus will be\nin a Bash-like environment.\n\n27\n00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.990\nAnd being able to install,\n\n28\n00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.050\ndownload, and some understanding of\nbasic Operating System configuration.\n\n29\n00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.572\nBecause that's the entire purpose of\ndockers, creating what's called a docker\n\n30\n00:01:39.572 --> 00:01:43.962\nimage that will then spin up containers\nthat behave like very light weight VMs,\n\n31\n00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:46.274\ninstead of provisioning full scale VMs.\n\n32\n00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:49.863\nSo, you need to have a little\nbit of experience there,\n\n33\n00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:54.790\nas far as Linux understanding and\ncommand line understanding.\n\n34\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.200\nBut that's about it.\n\n35\n00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.150\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell I guess that lands us to\n\n36\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.440\nwhat are some of the specific\ntopics that we'll cover.\n\n37\n00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.030\nJust give our good audience\nthere a taste of what's to come.\n\n38\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.350\n&gt;&gt; Well a taste, it does vary.\n\n39\n00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.760\nAnd sadly, Docker is one of those\nthings where like this is pretty easy,\n\n40\n00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.290\nthis is pretty easy, and then it can\nreally crank up at certain points.\n\n41\n00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.470\nSo what are we gonna cover?\n\n42\n00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.550\nWell, how do I run a container?\n\n43\n00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.850\nAnd this is assuming I've all\nready got Docker installed.\n\n44\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.720\nWe're actually gonna talk about installing\nDocker on all three major Operation System\n\n45\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.680\nenvironments, which has gotten a great\ndeal easier in the recent times.\n\n46\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.160\nBut how do I run a container?\n\n47\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.430\nHow do I get an image?\n\n48\n00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.280\nWhat is an image?\n\n49\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.450\nAnd how is that related to a container?\n\n50\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.310\nHow can I build a custom image?\n\n51\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.850\nWhen I build a custom image,\nhow do I distribute that?\n\n52\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.270\nIf I want to deploy to a cloud service, or\n\n53\n00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.620\nI want to save it somewhere,\nwhat do I do then?\n\n54\n00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.296\nHow can I use this to make very large\nkind of architectural decisions?\n\n55\n00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:58.202\nI focus mostly on application development,\nbecause well, that's what I do.\n\n56\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:02.557\nBut there are other use cases, and then we\ntake a look at some of the more advanced\n\n57\n00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:05.400\ntools, such as machine compose and swarm.\n\n58\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.830\nThen, they add on to the standard\ndocker tool set to allow for\n\n59\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.620\na really scaling up and out.\n\n60\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.520\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff.\n\n61\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.670\nNow a lot of the series that we do here at\nITProTV lend themselves to either being\n\n62\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.390\na technical skill, or a certification,\nor exam-based type of series.\n\n63\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.810\nWhich one of those categories\nwould you say this falls under?\n\n64\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.890\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is definitely a technical skill.\n\n65\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.340\nThis is for someone who wants to know,\nwell I know a little bit about computers.\n\n66\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.690\nI've been diving into some development,\nor even infrastructure management right?\n\n67\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.660\nMaybe you're working with developers and\n\n68\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.300\nthey're like hey, I need this, maybe this\nis something you can pass off to them.\n\n69\n00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.070\nHey, if you need to simulate\nan Ubuntu environment for\n\n70\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.160\nyour application to run in,\nhere's how you get this set up.\n\n71\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.930\nIt is definitely just about learning\nthe basics there, getting things up and\n\n72\n00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.610\nrunning and\nnot about obtaining a certification.\n\n73\n00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.935\nWe do not cover the entire\nbreadth of the Docker ecosphere.\n\n74\n00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:00.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n75\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.290\ndefinitely, just an introduction there.\n\n76\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.050\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell Justin that sounds awesome.\n\n77\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.360\nWe do appreciate your input on this topic.\n\n78\n00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360\nWe appreciate you guys.\n\n79\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.990\nHopefully if it sounds like\nsomething you're interested in,\n\n80\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.050\nwe'll see you in the upcoming series.\n\n81\n00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.789\n[SOUND]\n\n",
