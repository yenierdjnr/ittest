DevProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.385\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.235\nAnd in today's episode, well, we've got\na very special treat planned for you.\n\n5\n00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:25.575\nWe're starting Intro to C++, so\nyou better buckle up and hang on.\n\n6\n00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:28.790\nAnd here to help us with that very\nendeavor is Mr. Jacob Armstrong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.695\nHow you doing today, Jacob?\n\n8\n00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.275\n&gt;&gt; Very good, Justin, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:36.395\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, I'm\nparticularly excited about this series,\n\n10\n00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:40.747\nbecause I know C++ is kinda\nthe ideology of performance.\n\n11\n00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:45.170\nGames, scientific programming,\nwhich is kind of some of my background.\n\n12\n00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.200\nIf you wanna go fast,\nyou kinda gotta reach down into the metal.\n\n13\n00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.800\nNow that's about the extent that I know,\nso what exactly is C++?\n\n14\n00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.890\n&gt;&gt; So to give a brief overview, C++ is\na programming language made in the 1980s\n\n15\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.280\nby a Dutch computer scientist named, might\nmispronounce this, Bjarne Stroustrup.\n\n16\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.109\nIt is sort of the next iteration on C.\n\n17\n00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:13.270\nThey are two separate programming\nlanguages, C and C++.\n\n18\n00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.542\nThe joke is that the ++ operator\nis a go up one operator,\n\n19\n00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:23.605\nso C++ can be thought of as C up one.\n\n20\n00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:29.611\nSo C++ is a compiled\nobjected-oriented language.\n\n21\n00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:32.877\nCompiled means that it takes source\ncode that you write in text, and\n\n22\n00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:35.960\nturns into machine code\nwhenever you compile it.\n\n23\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.929\nAnd object-oriented means that\nit is not procedural, basically.\n\n24\n00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.022\nIt used to be that programming\nlanguages were sort of monolithic.\n\n25\n00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:49.783\nYou'd have the whole program in one file,\nand people would get method names mixed\n\n26\n00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:53.105\nup, they'd have variables\nbeing named the same thing.\n\n27\n00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:54.645\nIt was kind of a pain to debug.\n\n28\n00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:59.406\nSo the solution to that was to create\nobject-oriented languages where we\n\n29\n00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:03.840\nwould have data encapsulated\ninside objects and classes.\n\n30\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.440\n&gt;&gt; Now Jacob,\nI can actually speak to this.\n\n31\n00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.860\nI've worked on some legacy projects.\n\n32\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.939\nLegacy code is all kinds of\nfun where the entire program,\n\n33\n00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.090\nit wasn't necessarily in one file.\n\n34\n00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.530\nThere was one function per file.\n\n35\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.410\nAnd the functions were like\n300 to 400 lines long,\n\n36\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.410\nand then everything kind of compiled,\nthere was 160 files.\n\n37\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.180\nIt was a nightmare,\nmainly because everything was global.\n\n38\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.403\nPeople were using global variables for\nlogging and debugging.\n\n39\n00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:34.618\nAnd I will tell you, I got it working\nkinda, but it would have saved me a great\n\n40\n00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:41.310\ndeal of heart ache if that actual project\nhad been structured a little differently.\n\n41\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.487\n&gt;&gt; Right, and while we will go over\nthe details of object-oriented languages\n\n42\n00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:50.072\nlater, for now let's just actually try\nto get some C++ working on your machine.\n\n43\n00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:55.910\nSo here on my computer I'm gonna\ndownload a compiler for C++.\n\n44\n00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.575\nSo if I go to the Internet real quick.\n\n45\n00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:05.800\nI'm gonna get specifically\nthe Windows GNU compiler, right now.\n\n46\n00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.740\nAnd we aren't gonna use command line\ncompiling for all of our projects.\n\n47\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.440\nI just want to show you this in case\nyou want to know sort of the more low\n\n48\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.513\nlevel way to compile things.\n\n49\n00:03:16.513 --> 00:03:19.038\nOr, if you're not on Windows,\n\n50\n00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:24.193\nhow you could compile things on\nthe command line for Linux or Mac.\n\n51\n00:03:24.193 --> 00:03:28.619\nSo here we go,\nI believe the name is called WinGW.\n\n52\n00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:34.731\nMinGW, I'm sorry.\n\n53\n00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:38.710\nThat stands for\nMinimum GNU Compiler for Windows.\n\n54\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.177\nSo let's go on the official site,\nright here.\n\n55\n00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:44.670\nSo there's two places that\nyou can go to download this.\n\n56\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.740\nUp here in the top right corner,\nthere is a Downloads tab.\n\n57\n00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.483\nAnd toward the bottom in the navigation\npane here there is also a Downloads\n\n58\n00:03:54.483 --> 00:03:57.401\noption, so we're just gonna click on that.\n\n59\n00:04:01.444 --> 00:04:08.240\nAnd we want to get the latest\nversion of MinGWgitsetup.exe.\n\n60\n00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.562\nNow I've already gone ahead and\ndownloaded this,\n\n61\n00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:14.585\nso once you get this,\nyou're going to run it.\n\n62\n00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:18.777\nAnd I also have screenshots,\nthough, of the running process.\n\n63\n00:04:18.777 --> 00:04:25.358\nSo bear with me as I open them up,\nand here we go.\n\n64\n00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.326\nSo here we are.\n\n65\n00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:32.590\nLet me just get this out\nof behind my head if I can.\n\n66\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.175\nThank you.\n\n67\n00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:40.317\nSo first thing that happens is,\nthis is the last page actually.\n\n68\n00:04:40.317 --> 00:04:44.566\nThis is the last thing that happens,\nI think.\n\n69\n00:04:44.566 --> 00:04:48.630\nHold on, so I don't know how to\nuse Windows actually, I'm sorry.\n\n70\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.281\nLet's start from here.\n\n71\n00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:54.022\nFirst you're gonna have a just\ngeneral licensing agreement.\n\n72\n00:04:54.022 --> 00:05:00.665\nSo if you are okay with everything in\nhere, you will hit Install at the bottom.\n\n73\n00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:02.361\nAnd then after installing,\n\n74\n00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:11.660\nYou'll have to decide where you want to\ninstall it, this is actually important.\n\n75\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.490\nYou're gonna wanna remember this so\nthat you can set environment variables, so\n\n76\n00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.590\nthat the command line actually\nknows what programs to run.\n\n77\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.442\nHere there is a user interface option, I\nhave elected not to get the user interface\n\n78\n00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:27.107\nfor this, because I am just using a\ncompiled command line version to compile.\n\n79\n00:05:27.107 --> 00:05:31.296\nBut if you wanna download that user\ninterface and play with it a little bit,\n\n80\n00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:32.760\ngo right ahead.\n\n81\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.947\nAnd once you hit Continue\nit will begin to download.\n\n82\n00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:44.139\nSo once this is done, you can go ahead and\nhit Quit down here at the bottom right.\n\n83\n00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.849\nAnd you'll have MinGW\non your local machine.\n\n84\n00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.294\nWe can't actually compile\nanything quite yet.\n\n85\n00:05:54.294 --> 00:05:59.206\nFirst we actually do need to set\nan environment variable form engine\n\n86\n00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:02.308\nthat GW so\nthat the command line knows where\n\n87\n00:06:02.308 --> 00:06:06.420\nto find the command lines\nthat we're going to be using.\n\n88\n00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.399\n&gt;&gt; Now Jacob,\nlet me cut in here just a little bit.\n\n89\n00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:12.539\nThis MinGW, this is gonna be a very\nsimilar experience if you're in a command\n\n90\n00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.510\nline in a Linux environment, correct,\nor am I totally off base there?\n\n91\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.750\n&gt;&gt; You're absolutely correct.\n\n92\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.265\nLinux environments that we're gonna\nbe using the same GNU libraries that\n\n93\n00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:21.955\nWindows are.\n\n94\n00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:26.520\nThis is just sort of a GNU library for\nWindows specifically.\n\n95\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.621\nWe're gonna be using a G++ command.\n\n96\n00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:31.380\nLinux will do the same thing more or less.\n\n97\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.670\nSo this is more of a Windows specific\nthing that you have to do right now,\n\n98\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.900\nsetting up your environment variables.\n\n99\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.189\nSo we're gonna go onto the Windows tab and\ntype in My Computer.\n\n100\n00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.639\nActually in Windows 10\nit's gonna be This PC.\n\n101\n00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.359\nSo you're gonna right-click on this and\ngo to Properties.\n\n102\n00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:03.660\nAnd in Properties, we're gonna go\nto the Advanced System Settings.\n\n103\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.041\nAnd in Advanced System Settings, we're\ngoing to go to Environment Variables.\n\n104\n00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.093\nSo here's a list of\nenvironment variables for me,\n\n105\n00:07:12.093 --> 00:07:15.050\nyou should see something\nsimilar on your machine.\n\n106\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.901\nUnder System Variables, here are a bunch\nof things that you already have.\n\n107\n00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:23.867\nWhat we're gonna do specifically\nis edit the path variable.\n\n108\n00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:25.772\nThis is the path variable, and\n\n109\n00:07:25.772 --> 00:07:29.893\nhere is a bunch of paths that\nare already installed on my computer.\n\n110\n00:07:29.893 --> 00:07:31.493\nLet's go to Edit here.\n\n111\n00:07:34.757 --> 00:07:37.435\nAnd we're going to add\na new environment variable.\n\n112\n00:07:39.312 --> 00:07:41.776\nBut before we actually do this,\n\n113\n00:07:41.776 --> 00:07:45.989\nwe need to get that bin of the MinGW,\nso let's do that.\n\n114\n00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:50.629\nIf I remember correctly from my own\ninstall, that was under my C drive.\n\n115\n00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:57.550\nAnd right here, MinGW.\n\n116\n00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.678\nYou're gonna double-click on this,\ngo into it.\n\n117\n00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:03.444\nAnd go into the bin.\n\n118\n00:08:03.444 --> 00:08:05.920\nAnd we're going to copy this.\n\n119\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.560\nI already downloaded some stuff,\nso my bin is already full.\n\n120\n00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.860\nYou should only have one thing in\nhere by the time that you are,\n\n121\n00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.510\nwhen you're at the same\nplace I am basically.\n\n122\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.609\nSo we're gonna copy this, go back into\nour environment variable settings.\n\n123\n00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.310\nAnd paste it in here.\n\n124\n00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.230\nI've already done that.\n\n125\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.150\nI've got my MainGW.bin right\nhere where I need it to be.\n\n126\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.990\nAfter you do this you will need\nto restart your computer so\n\n127\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.700\nthat Windows knows where this is.\n\n128\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.780\nAnd it can just get setup done.\n\n129\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.213\nSo if you are listening to the recorded\nversion of this you can go ahead and\n\n130\n00:08:39.213 --> 00:08:40.969\npause it and restart your computer.\n\n131\n00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:44.734\nNow Jacob, let me just make sure,\nthat path that we're adding to the path\n\n132\n00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:47.180\nvariable from your\nenvironment in variables.\n\n133\n00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.168\nNumber one, Windows 10 has made this a lot\neasier than previous versions of Windows.\n\n134\n00:08:51.168 --> 00:08:54.306\nCuz it used to be this giant string that\nyou had to kind of concatenate on the end\n\n135\n00:08:54.306 --> 00:08:55.871\nof and you didn't have enough space.\n\n136\n00:08:55.871 --> 00:09:00.467\nSo that's slick, but also, that's gonna be\ndependent on your installation directory\n\n137\n00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:03.350\nfrom the previous install steps,\nam I right in that?\n\n138\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes absolutely.\n\n139\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.815\nIf you don't install\nMinGW under your C drive,\n\n140\n00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:13.270\nif you install it somewhere else, you\nwill need to go to that MinGW folder and\n\n141\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.540\ninto that bin inside that MinGW\nfolder instead of where I did it.\n\n142\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.770\nThe only thing that matters\nis that you get that bin,\n\n143\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.780\nthe path to that bin in the correct spot.\n\n144\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.017\nSo once you're done restarting, I'm\ngonna assume that you already done that,\n\n145\n00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:32.372\nYou should be ready to go for a compile.\n\n146\n00:09:34.293 --> 00:09:39.360\nSo to compile a C++ program, we actually\nneed to write some C++ source code.\n\n147\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.600\nSo let's get started on that for\nan example.\n\n148\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.700\nWe're just gonna write a very\nsimple Hello World program.\n\n149\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.818\nI'm just going to create a new text\nfile right here on my desktop.\n\n150\n00:09:55.886 --> 00:10:01.957\nAnd we're going to name it\nnot New Text Document.txt,\n\n151\n00:10:01.957 --> 00:10:06.879\nwe're going to name this helloworld.cpp.\n\n152\n00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:09.536\nIt's gonna complain that we\nare changing the name extension.\n\n153\n00:10:09.536 --> 00:10:12.690\nWe don't care,\nwe want it to be a .cpp file.\n\n154\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.690\nA .cpp extension means that\nit is a C++ source file.\n\n155\n00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.940\nThis is what we wanna do.\n\n156\n00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.668\nNow if you do initially make\nit a .txt file, that's okay,\n\n157\n00:10:24.668 --> 00:10:26.243\nyou can change it later.\n\n158\n00:10:26.243 --> 00:10:30.232\nBut will wanna make sure that you\nhave file extensions shown under\n\n159\n00:10:30.232 --> 00:10:31.618\nyour folder options.\n\n160\n00:10:31.618 --> 00:10:36.887\nActually I made that mistake,\nnot to recently ago\n\n161\n00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:42.291\nwhere I almost tried to\ncompile a .CPP.txt file.\n\n162\n00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:44.350\n&gt;&gt; That will happen,\nI've had things like that.\n\n163\n00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.275\nAnd another common error that I've made.\n\n164\n00:10:47.275 --> 00:10:50.790\nIs it has to be plain text it can't\nhave any rich text format in it.\n\n165\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.420\nIt can't be,\nyou can't do this in Word, and\n\n166\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.416\nthen change the file\nextension from like a .docx.\n\n167\n00:10:56.416 --> 00:11:00.955\nOtherwise, you'll have all this meta data\nthat's embedded in the top portion of\n\n168\n00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:04.522\nthe file that, well you're gonna\nhave a whole bunch of not fun.\n\n169\n00:11:04.522 --> 00:11:09.249\nSo has to be plain text and\nall plain text means is it is text only.\n\n170\n00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:13.509\nThere's no markup, there's no rendering\noptions, there's no styling, whatnot.\n\n171\n00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:17.084\nAs long as you're using notepad or\ncreating a new text document as was shown,\n\n172\n00:11:17.084 --> 00:11:18.940\nyou should be fine.\n\n173\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nnow we're going to open it up in Notepad\n\n174\n00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.840\nbecause that is a very\nsimple text editor program.\n\n175\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.830\nAnd we're going to get started.\n\n176\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.440\nSo, Hello World.\n\n177\n00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.770\nThe Hello World Program is going\nto do basically one thing,\n\n178\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.240\nit's going to find\na console output window.\n\n179\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.170\nAnd it's going to push\nHello World into that window.\n\n180\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.590\nYou may not understand\nexactly what I'm typing in.\n\n181\n00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.880\nI'll try to explain it as I go along.\n\n182\n00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.230\nBut the main details of this,\nwe're gonna cover in later lessons.\n\n183\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.520\nThis is just to get compiling done.\n\n184\n00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.360\nSo let's get started.\n\n185\n00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.440\nFirst thing we're gonna\nwant is a main function.\n\n186\n00:11:59.405 --> 00:12:05.175\nMain() is a special function in C++ and\nin some other programming languages.\n\n187\n00:12:05.175 --> 00:12:08.170\nMain() is where your\nprogram initially starts.\n\n188\n00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.144\nWithout a main method,\nyour program won't know where to start.\n\n189\n00:12:13.716 --> 00:12:17.137\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jacob, let me jump in there just\na little bit, just so we can make sure,\n\n190\n00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:19.980\nis there any way to make that\ntext just a little bit bigger?\n\n191\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.840\nI know I'm being nit picky here.\n\n192\n00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.350\nYeah.\n\n193\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.310\n&gt;&gt; Can do.\n\n194\n00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.260\n&gt;&gt; So, it's kinda of weird, this is\nactually simulating some styling but\n\n195\n00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.040\nthis isn't changing\nthe underlying text styling.\n\n196\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.190\nYeah there we go, we should be good there.\n\n197\n00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.400\nI'm going to now,\nslink away into the shadows.\n\n198\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.580\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully,\nyou won't have to squint anymore.\n\n199\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.875\nSo main() return 0,\nwhich means that after main is done,\n\n200\n00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:46.090\nit will spit back out\na 0 to whoever calls it.\n\n201\n00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.881\nThat's just nonsense,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n202\n00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:50.506\nDon't worry about it.\n\n203\n00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:55.404\nSo before that, we're gonna do std,\nwhich stands for standard, this is\n\n204\n00:12:55.404 --> 00:13:00.618\na standard namespace, a namespace being\njust a way to hold a bunch of classes,\n\n205\n00:13:00.618 --> 00:13:05.129\nand objects, and variables, and\nstuff together in a logical way.\n\n206\n00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:10.498\nAnd inside standard,\nwe are gonna go inside it with a colon,\n\n207\n00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:15.781\ncolon, we are gonna do,\ncout that stands for console out.\n\n208\n00:13:15.781 --> 00:13:19.492\nWe're gonna use this,\na less than less than symbol,\n\n209\n00:13:19.492 --> 00:13:25.602\nwhich is called a pipe operator, and we're\ngoing to type pipe into console out, this.\n\n210\n00:13:29.655 --> 00:13:31.830\nIf I can spell world correctly.\n\n211\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:37.520\nAnd then after that, we're going to\ntype into cout a standard end line.\n\n212\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.200\nAnd this'll just create an entry so\nit looks nice.\n\n213\n00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.360\nBut actually this won't work as it is.\n\n214\n00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.310\nIf we try to compile this right now,\nit'll say I don't know what cout is, and\n\n215\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.900\nI don't know what endl is.\n\n216\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.827\nBecause we haven't imported\nthe input output stream library.\n\n217\n00:13:58.072 --> 00:13:59.840\nSo to import things\nwe're gonna do include.\n\n218\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.550\nWe'll talk about importing\nthings later in detail.\n\n219\n00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.184\nThis is just basically what\nwe're doing right now,\n\n220\n00:14:06.184 --> 00:14:10.079\nis bringing in the input\noutput classes and variables.\n\n221\n00:14:15.703 --> 00:14:20.080\nInclude says to bring this in,\nand this is iostream.\n\n222\n00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.920\nSo we should be good to go.\n\n223\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.920\nThis should compile.\n\n224\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.652\nSo let's open up our command line.\n\n225\n00:14:26.652 --> 00:14:31.231\nIf you've been following so\nfar, you should have\n\n226\n00:14:31.231 --> 00:14:36.038\nMinGW on your machine,\nbut you haven't actually.\n\n227\n00:14:36.038 --> 00:14:40.694\nI forgot, you don't actually have a C++\ncompiler on your machine right now.\n\n228\n00:14:46.378 --> 00:14:48.190\nSo we're gonna type in command prompt and\nopen it up.\n\n229\n00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.000\nSo if you set up your bin correctly and\nyour environment variables,\n\n230\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.570\nyou should be able to access MinGW\nmethods, command prompts I should say.\n\n231\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.390\nThe important thing that you need\nto do right now is to download\n\n232\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.720\nthat C++ compiler.\n\n233\n00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:10.000\nYou can do that by typing\n\n234\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.397\nin MinGW dash get install G++.\n\n235\n00:15:17.397 --> 00:15:24.458\nNow, this G++ is the GNU C++ compiler,\nit's open source, and it's for Windows.\n\n236\n00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:27.690\nRight now, it's yelling at me\nthat I've already installed it.\n\n237\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:32.464\nBut, if you install it at this point,\nyou should see something like this.\n\n238\n00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:36.120\nAnd this will go on for,\nI don't know, a minute or so.\n\n239\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:42.930\nAnd once that's done, you will have the\nMGW and the GNU compiler on your machine.\n\n240\n00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.644\nAnd because this downloads to the same\nbin that you installed MinGW,\n\n241\n00:15:46.644 --> 00:15:49.792\nyou don't need to set up\nanymore environment variables.\n\n242\n00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:52.469\nIt should all be there already.\n\n243\n00:15:52.469 --> 00:15:56.605\nAll right, so now we're in users Jacob.\n\n244\n00:15:56.605 --> 00:16:00.019\nI'm going to CD, stands for\nchange directory.\n\n245\n00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:06.257\nInto desktop which is\nwhere our C++ file is.\n\n246\n00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:12.325\nIf I say dir, it'll list it Right here.\n\n247\n00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:14.520\nHello world .cpp.\n\n248\n00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.500\nSo we're gonna type in now is\nwe're gonna compile that hello\n\n249\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.187\nworld.cpp file by going g++,\nwhich is the compiler,\n\n250\n00:16:24.187 --> 00:16:27.649\nwe're gonna compile Hello World.cpp.\n\n251\n00:16:27.649 --> 00:16:30.620\nWe're gonna do a dash o.\n\n252\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.160\nThis means output, this is what\nthe compiler will be outputting.\n\n253\n00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.960\nAnd this is gonna be\nthe name of our executable.\n\n254\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.340\nWe're gonna call this one sayhello.exe.\n\n255\n00:16:46.895 --> 00:16:47.769\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Jacob,\n\n256\n00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:49.866\nit looks like we have\na whoopsy daisy there, but\n\n257\n00:16:49.866 --> 00:16:51.850\nthese are actually good moments, right?\n\n258\n00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.490\nThese are things that you may encounter,\nbecause well we're using regular Notepad.\n\n259\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.870\nThere's no syntax highlighting, there's\nno IntelliSense, there's no help, so\n\n260\n00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.490\nif you have a typo,\nyou may encounter something like that.\n\n261\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.780\nAnd, well,\nthe compiled languages typically say,\n\n262\n00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.150\nhey, you're probably gonna wanna look\nat this line or pretty close to it.\n\n263\n00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.800\nThere are exceptions to that rule.\n\n264\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.850\nAnd it looks like we're\ngonna have to fix something.\n\n265\n00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:13.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n266\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.040\nIf you make a mistake, don't worry,\nthe compiler's gonna yell at you.\n\n267\n00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.800\nAnd in this case,\nit'll tell us exactly where our error was.\n\n268\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.290\nSo it seems I misspelled return.\n\n269\n00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.534\nReturn is spelled R-E-T-U-R-N,\nand not R-E-T-U-N, so\n\n270\n00:17:26.534 --> 00:17:28.970\nI just forgot an R there, my mistake.\n\n271\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.760\nSo let's open back up Notepad, I opened it\nat Visual Studio, I don't wanna do that.\n\n272\n00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.375\nVisual Studio is an IDE, for\nthose of you who don't know.\n\n273\n00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:42.990\nAn IDE stands for\nIntegrated Design Environment.\n\n274\n00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.230\nWe'll download it later and we're gonna\nbe using that to edit C++ in the future.\n\n275\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.551\nBut for now,\nlet's just fix our return statement.\n\n276\n00:17:54.099 --> 00:17:55.950\nSave it.\n\n277\n00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.900\nAnd try to compile it once more I'm just\n\n278\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.875\ngonna hit up on the keyboard\nto do the same command again.\n\n279\n00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.310\nSayhello.exe.\n\n280\n00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.110\nAnd it didn't yell at me this time,\nso that means it worked.\n\n281\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.570\nYou can see right here down\nthe left corner of my screen,\n\n282\n00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.020\nwe have an executable.\n\n283\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.230\nSo if we double-click on this.\n\n284\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.090\nYou may have saw that.\n\n285\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.010\nA command window popped up really fast and\nthen exited really fast again.\n\n286\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.830\nSo what happened was the command\nprompt said, hello world.\n\n287\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.410\nAnd then it said, well, I'm done here.\n\n288\n00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.630\nI might as well just\nexit this application.\n\n289\n00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:38.463\nSo what we're gonna do\nnow inside of our C++\n\n290\n00:18:38.463 --> 00:18:43.800\nfile is add, after we spit Hello World\nout to the console, we're going to\n\n291\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:50.140\nsay std::cin, which is console input.\n\n292\n00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.300\nAnd we're gonna call\nthe ignore method on that.\n\n293\n00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.960\nAnd this'll just freeze up the console so\nthat it doesn't exit automatically.\n\n294\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.637\nLet's do another compile.\n\n295\n00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.800\nIt's happy with what I wrote.\n\n296\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:12.360\nAnd once we open up SayHello.exe again,\nHello World.\n\n297\n00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.730\nIt's a really small font.\n\n298\n00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.900\nYou might need to enlarge\nthat in the future.\n\n299\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.620\nBut for now, there you go.\n\n300\n00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.960\nThat's how you would manually\ncompile a C++ program.\n\n301\n00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.070\n&gt;&gt; Now Jacob, there's a few things\nthere that I do wanna kinda drive home.\n\n302\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:31.530\nThose of you on Linux platforms,\nwhether it be RedHat or Ubuntu based or\n\n303\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.640\nother ones, your package manager is\ngoing to be able to install G++ as well.\n\n304\n00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.640\nSo do I have to install G++,\n\n305\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.780\nand pretty much everything that Jacob\nshowed you is going to be the same.\n\n306\n00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:46.790\nFor Mac users, you have a little bit\nof tweaking that you need to do because\n\n307\n00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.900\nMac is gonna have a different compiler,\nbut\n\n308\n00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.220\ntypically that is available\nfairly straight out of the box.\n\n309\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.830\nOr at the very least, you can download X\ncode which would install that, as well.\n\n310\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:01.040\nNow, you kinda hinted at\nsomething that it's not great.\n\n311\n00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.450\nWe seem to have some issues with Notepad,\nright?\n\n312\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.420\nTypos, things like that.\n\n313\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.410\nIs there a better way to\nactually write C++ code?\n\n314\n00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n315\n00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.320\nNotepad is just a basic text editor,\nit's not really made to write code.\n\n316\n00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.710\nBut there are programs out there that\nare actually made to write code.\n\n317\n00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.200\nThey're called IDEs.\n\n318\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.920\nOnce again,\nthose are integrated design environments.\n\n319\n00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.570\nOne of those, for Windows at least,\nis called Visual Studio.\n\n320\n00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.910\nThe community version of\nVisual Studio is free,\n\n321\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:36.020\nand that is what we will be using\nto write C+ code in the future.\n\n322\n00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.520\nAnd one of the nice things about Visual\nStudio is that you don't have to manually\n\n323\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.100\ncompile it each time you write code.\n\n324\n00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.840\nThere's a button you can click and\nit just does that for you, and\n\n325\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.780\nit runs it automatically.\n\n326\n00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.830\nSo, Visual Studio.\n\n327\n00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.275\nTo download that,\nlet's just search for Visual Studio.\n\n328\n00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.370\nIt's the first thing that pops up.\n\n329\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.559\nMicrosoft Visual Studio.\n\n330\n00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.430\nAnd we have this\nDownload Visual Studio option.\n\n331\n00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.240\nWe're gonna wanna go for Community 2017.\n\n332\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.697\nThat is the latest free version.\n\n333\n00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.450\nAnd it will download automatically.\n\n334\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.171\nI've already downloaded Visual Studio\non this machine before, so.\n\n335\n00:21:16.171 --> 00:21:19.295\nOnce again, I will show you screenshots\nof the process here on out.\n\n336\n00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.550\nSo first thing, whenever you run that\ndownloaded executable it's gonna ask\n\n337\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.060\nyou to accept license agreements.\n\n338\n00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.110\nAnd then, it will download.\n\n339\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:37.654\nThis will download all\nof the initial setup for\n\n340\n00:21:37.654 --> 00:21:46.053\nVisual Studio, but it won't\nactually download C++ information.\n\n341\n00:21:46.053 --> 00:21:48.307\nOnce the basic Visual Studio framework\nis downloaded, it will ask you what\n\n342\n00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.695\nsort of flavor of programming language\nthat you want to use Visual Studio for.\n\n343\n00:21:50.695 --> 00:21:52.634\nSo there are a lot of options here.\n\n344\n00:21:52.634 --> 00:21:55.097\nTry no to be too overwhelmed.\n\n345\n00:21:55.097 --> 00:22:01.320\nThe one here, Desktop Development with\nC++, that's what you wanna go for.\n\n346\n00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.510\nThat'll download everything you need\nto develop with C++ on Visual Studio.\n\n347\n00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:10.010\nIf you're more of a expert user, and\nyou want to download a few less things or\n\n348\n00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.530\na few more things, you can go to\nIndividual Components, up here.\n\n349\n00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.600\nJust play with it.\n\n350\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.650\nAnd if you mess up,\nit should be easy enough to try again.\n\n351\n00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:24.570\nI believe all you'd have to do\nis just re-run the installer and\n\n352\n00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.200\nit'll give you this option again, and\nyou can just choose what you need to.\n\n353\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:28.760\n&gt;&gt; Quick aside.\n\n354\n00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.910\nQuick forewarning for those of you who\nare saying, yeah, that seems easy.\n\n355\n00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:34.150\nIt's actually a wonderful kind of setup,\n\n356\n00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.930\nespecially if you have multiple languages\nor multiple environments that you need to\n\n357\n00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.340\ndevelop against that are by default out\nof the box supported by Visual Studio.\n\n358\n00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.170\nNot Visual Studio Code,\nthat's a lightweight text editor.\n\n359\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.120\nIt will give you some of the features, but\nnot necessarily the compilation tools and\n\n360\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.000\nthings like that.\n\n361\n00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.280\nSo that's number one.\n\n362\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.230\nNumber two, be very careful about\njust clicking all of those.\n\n363\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.360\nI think I did that one time just\nto see how much it was gonna.\n\n364\n00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.080\nI think it was something like 75 gigabytes\nworth of stuff it was trying to install,\n\n365\n00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.520\nwhich would take an incredibly long time.\n\n366\n00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.070\nSo I tend to do those incrementally.\n\n367\n00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.900\nLike, well,\nlet me get the one that I need, and\n\n368\n00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.470\nthen I'll rerun the installer\nif I need to install one.\n\n369\n00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:18.340\nAnd that way, I spread that time overtime\ninstead of I'm gonna wait for this\n\n370\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.410\n75 gigabytes worth of install packages\nto download and install my computer.\n\n371\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.570\nAnd that's the actual downloaded portion.\n\n372\n00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.460\nI'll give you a projected\nlike install portion as well.\n\n373\n00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.250\nBut do keep in mind, I'm probably gonna\nstart with a few to begin with so you're\n\n374\n00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:37.530\nnot waiting days, even on high speed\nInternet, to go, yeah, I finally have it.\n\n375\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.960\nCan we compile something?\n\n376\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.170\nBut just a caveat there.\n\n377\n00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.970\nVisual Studio Code is the text editor, and\n\n378\n00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.140\ndon't get crazy with\nselecting those check boxes.\n\n379\n00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.454\n&gt;&gt; Right, for now all we need is C++.\n\n380\n00:23:48.454 --> 00:23:53.350\nSo once you download all those C++ stuff,\nthis is the screen\n\n381\n00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.163\nthat shows you downloading\nC++ compiler and helper code.\n\n382\n00:23:58.163 --> 00:24:00.453\nIt'll ask you to restart your computer,\nso once again,\n\n383\n00:24:00.453 --> 00:24:01.894\nwe'll need to do another restart.\n\n384\n00:24:01.894 --> 00:24:06.103\nTry not to be doing any mission critical\nstuff while you're watching this video,\n\n385\n00:24:06.103 --> 00:24:06.779\nbasically.\n\n386\n00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:10.770\nA lot of restarts required\nto make a C++ code happen.\n\n387\n00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.460\nSo once you do have Visual Studio,\nyou can update it,\n\n388\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.839\nI'm just gonna close out of this.\n\n389\n00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:20.291\nThis is my old helloworld.text\nprogram that we made on the desktop.\n\n390\n00:24:20.291 --> 00:24:23.015\nWhat we're going to do, it crashed,\n\n391\n00:24:23.015 --> 00:24:27.269\nI swear it usually doesn't happen,\nit's a really good program.\n\n392\n00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:30.044\nLet's open up Visual Studio.\n\n393\n00:24:32.618 --> 00:24:34.523\nAnd you should see a start up screen,\n\n394\n00:24:34.523 --> 00:24:37.549\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna create a new project.\n\n395\n00:24:41.963 --> 00:24:44.302\nFile, New, Project.\n\n396\n00:24:44.302 --> 00:24:47.792\nThere's going to be a Visual C++ project,\nand\n\n397\n00:24:47.792 --> 00:24:51.633\nthere's going to be\na Windows Console Application.\n\n398\n00:24:51.633 --> 00:24:55.944\nSo let's name it whatever we want,\n\n399\n00:24:55.944 --> 00:25:02.133\nI'm going to call this Tutorial Project,\nhit OK.\n\n400\n00:25:06.016 --> 00:25:12.132\nAnd this will just create a bunch of\nbasic code that we need to do C++ things.\n\n401\n00:25:12.132 --> 00:25:15.844\n&gt;&gt; Now, this is already set up,\nI was hoping to jump in there.\n\n402\n00:25:15.844 --> 00:25:20.026\nAdding Mingew bin to the directory,\nwith a C++ compiler,\n\n403\n00:25:20.026 --> 00:25:22.328\nthat doesn't cause any issues.\n\n404\n00:25:22.328 --> 00:25:25.390\nDo we have to worry about that\nwhile having both that and\n\n405\n00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.930\nVisual Studio installed?\n\n406\n00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.741\nOr is it kind of Visual Studio will\ntake care of a lot of that for us?\n\n407\n00:25:30.741 --> 00:25:33.495\n&gt;&gt; With the bin stuff, Visual Studio\ntakes care all of that for you,\n\n408\n00:25:33.495 --> 00:25:35.715\nthat's probably actually\nwhy it needs to restart.\n\n409\n00:25:35.715 --> 00:25:39.598\nAfter we restarted for Mingew,\nVisual Studio needs to restart for\n\n410\n00:25:39.598 --> 00:25:41.135\nits own C++ compilers.\n\n411\n00:25:41.135 --> 00:25:45.707\nSo, here we are, it opened us\nup on tutorial_project.cpp and\n\n412\n00:25:45.707 --> 00:25:48.682\nwe already have a main method right here.\n\n413\n00:25:48.682 --> 00:25:53.999\nSo, what we're gonna do is\nre-open our helloworld.cpp file,\n\n414\n00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:56.521\nit sort of copied things over.\n\n415\n00:25:56.521 --> 00:26:01.896\nThe main thing we need\nis our printing to out,\n\n416\n00:26:01.896 --> 00:26:07.563\nand causing the console\nto stop once we do that.\n\n417\n00:26:07.563 --> 00:26:11.754\nAnd also,\nwe need to include the iostream library.\n\n418\n00:26:15.467 --> 00:26:16.628\nI'll just paste that right there.\n\n419\n00:26:16.628 --> 00:26:21.471\nAnd if everything worked,\nit should be all right to compile.\n\n420\n00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:26.440\nWe're going to go up to\nLocal Windows Debugger, push the button,\n\n421\n00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.557\nclick it, it's gonna ask us to build it.\n\n422\n00:26:29.557 --> 00:26:32.785\nThat's okay,\nthis is the compiling process,\n\n423\n00:26:32.785 --> 00:26:37.479\nand once this is done, it should\nautomatically launch our program.\n\n424\n00:26:39.676 --> 00:26:42.393\nInstead of creating executable and\nhaving us launch it ourselves.\n\n425\n00:26:42.393 --> 00:26:46.162\nHere we are, Hello World, same thing,\nand that's Visual Studio.\n\n426\n00:26:46.162 --> 00:26:50.147\nIt's very convenient to use, and\nI believe we will be using it for\n\n427\n00:26:50.147 --> 00:26:52.404\nthe rest of our classes from here on.\n\n428\n00:26:52.404 --> 00:26:55.425\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jacob,\nthat's definitely a handy tool.\n\n429\n00:26:55.425 --> 00:26:57.336\nI saw that it's always trying to help you,\n\n430\n00:26:57.336 --> 00:26:59.628\nit's keeping your projects\nkind of put together.\n\n431\n00:26:59.628 --> 00:27:03.724\nAnd point and click, whenever, if you're\nnot familiar with the command line,\n\n432\n00:27:03.724 --> 00:27:05.605\nthat can get a little overwhelming.\n\n433\n00:27:05.605 --> 00:27:10.064\nSo thank you so much, we got our initial\nVisual Studio install up and going,\n\n434\n00:27:10.064 --> 00:27:13.494\nwe've actually compiled and\nran a couple of C++ codes.\n\n435\n00:27:13.494 --> 00:27:15.641\nNow you may not know everything\nthat's going on, but\n\n436\n00:27:15.641 --> 00:27:18.897\nthat's why you should stay tuned,\nbecause we've got more C++ coming at you.\n\n437\n00:27:18.897 --> 00:27:21.822\nBut it does look like we are running\nlow on time for this episode, so\n\n438\n00:27:21.822 --> 00:27:23.819\nwe're going to go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n439\n00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:27.027\nSo signing off for DevPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n440\n00:27:27.027 --> 00:27:28.154\n&gt;&gt; I'm Jacob Armstrong.\n\n441\n00:27:28.154 --> 00:27:29.179\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n442\n00:27:29.179 -->
