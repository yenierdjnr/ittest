[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.680\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.170\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.220\nin today's episode we are kicking\noff our series on web API's right?\n\n8\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.370\nWeb development.\n\n9\n00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.050\nHow do we do that?\n\n10\n00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.750\nWhat's it all about?\n\n11\n00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.476\nAnd of course joining me in the studio our\nresident expert on that very topic, Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:29.510\nJustin Dennison.\n\n13\n00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.460\nJustin welcome to the show, sir.\n\n14\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.170\nHow's it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.850\n&gt;&gt; It's going fairly well.\n\n16\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.600\nHow are you today, Dan?\n\n17\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.450\n&gt;&gt; I am not unwell, thank you.\n\n18\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.880\n&gt;&gt; I like to hear that.\n\n19\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.970\nNot too much of\na commitment on being well.\n\n20\n00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.766\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But not unwell either.\n\n21\n00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.850\nSo I'm very happy about that.\n\n22\n00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.080\nSo if you've seen a little bit of\nJavaScript, a little bit of HTML,\n\n23\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.970\nlittle bit of CSS, you have the building\nblocks for starting to develop web apps.\n\n24\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.360\nAnd that's the first\nthing I wanna talk about.\n\n25\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.160\nSometimes there's a misconception about\nwhat is meant by web development.\n\n26\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.820\nWhat is a web developer?\n\n27\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.648\nAnd it gets a little loose.\n\n28\n00:01:00.648 --> 00:01:04.300\nIt's kind of hard to define, but\nI want to really pull apart.\n\n29\n00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.810\nThere's a difference between web design,\nwhich is determining what it looks like,\n\n30\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.500\nhow those interactions are gonna be for\na user, and actually web development,\n\n31\n00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.850\nwhere you're actually building\nthe application that behaves that way.\n\n32\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.230\nSo web development is more kind of\nlow level programmatic access and\n\n33\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.570\nyou may still do some of those pretty\nthings, right, layout and styling.\n\n34\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.570\nThose are definitely part of it, but\n\n35\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.640\nthe real cracks the issue is function or\nreform.\n\n36\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.250\nAnd some of that is a little\nbit of personal bias, some not,\n\n37\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.530\nI'm not gonna say that there is not,\nyou ask ten people,\n\n38\n00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.120\nten people will give you different\nanswers about what is web development.\n\n39\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.880\nAnd I think that's something we have\nto work on within the industry.\n\n40\n00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.867\nNow, before we really dive in,\nthis is a little bit of a set up and\n\n41\n00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:50.545\nback story video, I'm gonna be throwing\na lot of terms at you, so be prepared.\n\n42\n00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:54.490\nBe like ugh, I'm gonna show you where to\ngo seek out additional information How to\n\n43\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.262\nget set up for future episodes, where\nwe actually start building things, and\n\n44\n00:01:58.262 --> 00:02:01.610\nthen we're going to poke around and\nlook at some of these web API's.\n\n45\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.350\nNow that's the first term I'm\ngonna stop at, what is an API?\n\n46\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.000\nIt's actually an acronym that stands for\napplication programming interface.\n\n47\n00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.950\nAnd what I like to think of it is,\nit's the doorknob, right.\n\n48\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.170\nSo let's think about if you had a door and\n\n49\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.500\nit doesn't have doorknob,\nthen how do you use the door?\n\n50\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.170\nAnd very valid case in point\nif you've ever been to a place\n\n51\n00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.740\nthat has those ambiguous handles\nthat could be push or pull.\n\n52\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.320\nAnd you go up to it and you push it and\nit's a pull handle, or you pull it and\n\n53\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.540\nit's a push handle.\n\n54\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.530\nWell, that's not a good interface,\nI don't know how to use that.\n\n55\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.130\nAll right,\napplication programming interfaces, or\n\n56\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.930\nAPIs, are provided to you in\norder to give you some clarity.\n\n57\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.040\nThis is how you use this.\n\n58\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.800\n&gt;&gt; There's a sign on the door\nthat says push or pull.\n\n59\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.226\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, and\nthere's a common accepted practice and\n\n60\n00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:53.667\na commonly accepted patterns\nthat you would use these APIs.\n\n61\n00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.477\nWe're actually gonna dive\ninto some of those today, and\n\n62\n00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:58.540\nsee, what is available to me?\n\n63\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.380\nAnd you may be surprised at how powerful\nyour browser and the web environment is.\n\n64\n00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.130\nBut before we do that we should talk\nabout what browser are we using?\n\n65\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.775\nHow are we gonna develop\nthese applications?\n\n66\n00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:10.830\nWhat do we need to get started?\n\n67\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.930\nSo I think it's best to go ahead and\ndrop into our screen here.\n\n68\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.070\nLet's take a look, so I have Chrome open.\n\n69\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.440\nThe weird thing about it is, I wanna\nmake sure you know where to find Chrome,\n\n70\n00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.260\nbut we're gonna look that up in Chrome,\nkind of an inception type thing.\n\n71\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.400\nGotta be careful there.\n\n72\n00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.370\nSo I have just a blank Chrome but\nif I wanted to go find Chrome,\n\n73\n00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.600\nI could actually go to Google,\nand look up Chrome.\n\n74\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.060\nAnd it will be this first link.\n\n75\n00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.960\nYou have to be careful,\nthis is an actually an ad.\n\n76\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.380\nSometimes it takes you like weird places.\n\n77\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.560\nYou'll eventually get to\nthe download page, but\n\n78\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.980\nI recommend coming to this next one and\nclicking on Google Chrome.\n\n79\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.340\nNow what's amazing about this site, number\none it's fairly well made, it's pretty.\n\n80\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.790\nBut if you click download for\npersonal computers, it will recognize what\n\n81\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.510\noperating system you're using, which\nis one of those powers of the browser.\n\n82\n00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.510\nThat's actually from one of those\nAPI's we were talking about.\n\n83\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.010\nI can gather that information, and\nsay, you need to download Chrome, and\n\n84\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.650\nI'm on a Mac so it's telling me,\nyou need to download Chrome for Mac.\n\n85\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.630\nSo definitely download Chrome because\nwe're gonna leverage some of its\n\n86\n00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.900\ndeveloper tools to poke around it and\n\n87\n00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.270\ntry to understand what's\ngoing on behind the scenes.\n\n88\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.670\nThese tools do exist in other browsers\nsuch as Safari, Firefox, Opera, and Edge.\n\n89\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.840\nInternet Explorer,\nsome are good, some are bad,\n\n90\n00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.120\nit's kinda hard to\ndelineate all the versions.\n\n91\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.270\nSo if you're using Internet Explorer for\n\n92\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.380\nnow, I would move over to\none of those other browsers.\n\n93\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.532\n&gt;&gt; No Netscape navigator thrown in there?\n\n94\n00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:47.609\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day, I did use Netscape\na great deal, but the problem was,\n\n95\n00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:52.348\nI didn't understand Netscape\nnavigator versus communicator,\n\n96\n00:04:52.348 --> 00:04:57.530\nI was younger, I was just click it,\nI don't know, just click it.\n\n97\n00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.180\nSo JavaScript and web development kinda\nburgeoned out of the Netscape ecosystem.\n\n98\n00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.210\nSo we have Netscape to thank for\na great deal of things.\n\n99\n00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.150\nNow in addition to Chrome, we're gonna\nbe using, we gotta write these programs,\n\n100\n00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.260\nwe gotta build these applications.\n\n101\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.450\nWe could use a plain text editor,\n\n102\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.650\non a Mac I could use text edit,\non Windows I could use notepad.\n\n103\n00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:24.210\nLet me emphasize very strongly, just\nbecause you can, doesn't mean you should.\n\n104\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.870\nThat's a very key point.\n\n105\n00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.770\nText editors can be your friend,\n\n106\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.630\nthey can also be the number one hindrance\nto making any kind of progress.\n\n107\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.920\nAnd I've heard some purists go, well if\nyou can't use a pure text editor right,\n\n108\n00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.780\nit just shows just blocks\nof text on the page and\n\n109\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.230\nfigure out what's going on then you\ndon't really know what's going on.\n\n110\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.850\nWell that may be true but\n\n111\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.320\nI don't need to know how my car\nstarts in order to drive it to work.\n\n112\n00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.550\nSo, there's some pluses and minuses there.\n\n113\n00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.210\nI like using what is called a rich\ntext editor because it helps me\n\n114\n00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.700\nget rid of some of those\nminor nuance problems\n\n115\n00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.430\nespecially when there's all these\nsyntactical issues that may crop up.\n\n116\n00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.050\nI forgot a semicolon here.\n\n117\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.060\nIt would have taken me forever to figure\nout where that issue was except my\n\n118\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.340\ntext editor goes, it's right there.\n\n119\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.040\nSo that's very important.\n\n120\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.960\nSo let's go ahead and look at what\ntext editor I would recommend and\n\n121\n00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.430\na few possible alternatives to them.\n\n122\n00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.080\nSo if we hop back into our Chrome browser.\n\n123\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.420\nLet's just go back to Google.\n\n124\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.080\nAnd if you look up Atom text editor,\nnot Ubuntu.\n\n125\n00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.920\nIf you're on Ubuntu, it is available for\nUbuntu, that's one of the reasons I like\n\n126\n00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.980\nthis text editor is it is cross\nplatform for Linux, Mac, and Windows.\n\n127\n00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.410\nAnd it it is fairly uniform.\n\n128\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.350\nInterestingly enough,\nit's built using web technologies.\n\n129\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.599\nIt is built with HTML,\nCSS, and JavaScript.\n\n130\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.180\nKind of mind blown.\n\n131\n00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.610\nIt's more or less a browser\nthat is not really a browser.\n\n132\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.380\n&gt;&gt; So you're using the technologies\nthat we're gonna be using to create\n\n133\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.600\nthis technology.\n\n134\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n135\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so,\n\n136\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.320\nthe web has kind of burgeoned\nout of its normal browser realm.\n\n137\n00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.410\nAnd with the advent of newer technologies,\nwhich, we hopefully will get into\n\n138\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.360\nlater on, maybe not necessarily in\nthis series but as we burgeon out.\n\n139\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.231\nThey've kinda broke loose\nthe browser environment and\n\n140\n00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:17.602\nafford us to make desktop applications,\nmobile applications.\n\n141\n00:07:17.602 --> 00:07:22.148\nIt becomes really powerful because\nif I know web development,\n\n142\n00:07:22.148 --> 00:07:26.523\nby proxy know desktop development,\nmobile development and\n\n143\n00:07:26.523 --> 00:07:30.057\nI can still make a website,\nso and I mean suplex.\n\n144\n00:07:30.057 --> 00:07:34.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and dont yell, they'll fall.\n\n145\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:40.700\nSo, if we take a look here, this is Atom,\nthis also recognizes what platform that\n\n146\n00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.150\nyou need installer package for, right,\nI have a Mac, it says download for Mac.\n\n147\n00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.720\nI use some Linux computers here and there.\n\n148\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.420\nI have this on my Linux computers.\n\n149\n00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.040\nIt says download for Linux.\n\n150\n00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.895\nAnd if I'm not mistaken,\nlet's take a look at other platforms.\n\n151\n00:07:55.895 --> 00:07:57.239\nLet's see here.\n\n152\n00:07:57.239 --> 00:07:58.711\nI may zoom in here.\n\n153\n00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.712\nThere's the Debian Package.\n\n154\n00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:05.062\nAnd I do not see right offhand\n\n155\n00:08:05.062 --> 00:08:10.560\nan RPM for, yeah, there it is.\n\n156\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.420\n&gt;&gt; It's hiding.\n\n157\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.250\n&gt;&gt; So both of those flavors of Linux,\nthose packaging systems for\n\n158\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.560\nLinux are supported.\n\n159\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.910\nAnd notice these are installers for\nall kinds of different ones, and\n\n160\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.710\nif you feel really adventurous,\nyou can just get the source.\n\n161\n00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And make it work.\n\n162\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.076\nSo it's available, That's why I like Adam.\n\n163\n00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:32.250\nAdam provides a rich environment that\nwe can add plugins and customize, and\n\n164\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.810\nit will fit our development\nworkflow exactly how we want it.\n\n165\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Justin, and I actually use that\non myself to develop notes and things for\n\n166\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.440\nthe shows.\n\n167\n00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.690\nI really enjoy it, the other guys,\nthey use other stuff.\n\n168\n00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.900\nI think I'm probably one of the few Adam\nusers now, you're one of them as well,\n\n169\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.480\nbecause they don't like that it\ndoesn't print out of the gate.\n\n170\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.070\nYou have to do some finagling to make it\nprint, that's one of its downfalls, or\n\n171\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.940\nwhatever, I don't find it to\nbe that difficult though.\n\n172\n00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.580\n&gt;&gt; You know, it's funny.\n\n173\n00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.040\nBecause I just write everything, and then\nI just go back and either write a Python\n\n174\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.310\nor a JavaScript, that'll run through and\njust aggregate all of that for me.\n\n175\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.780\nSo me not being able to print,\nit just compiles it into a PDF, and\n\n176\n00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.510\nI'll print it anyways.\n\n177\n00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.430\nSo it doesn't really matter,\nI'm like, all right, so that's Adam.\n\n178\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.450\nWhat are some alternatives?\n\n179\n00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.621\nThere is Sublime Text, which kind\nof came onto the scene before Adam.\n\n180\n00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:21.710\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar to Adam.\n\n181\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.964\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I've used it a little bit.\n\n182\n00:09:22.964 --> 00:09:23.650\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n183\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:28.190\nIt is very similar to Adam, I think\nthey're on Sublime Text version three, and\n\n184\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.320\nit is fairly frequently updated.\n\n185\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.130\nThis does take a little more tweaking to\nget to work out of the box just as you\n\n186\n00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.410\nwant it to, because when you\ninstall extensions and add them,\n\n187\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.160\nthat's part of the standard\ninstallation in Sublime,\n\n188\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.100\nunless they changed things recently,\nwhich they may have.\n\n189\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.950\nYet you have to install that first before\nyou can go out and seek other packages.\n\n190\n00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.805\nBut some of the features you see in\nAdam actually originated in the Sublime\n\n191\n00:09:51.805 --> 00:09:54.640\ncommunity, and\nthey kinda play off each other.\n\n192\n00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.000\nNow technically Sublime is not free,\nright?\n\n193\n00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.340\nYou get this like, free to use, and\nthen you are supposed to buy a license,\n\n194\n00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.870\nso that's something you keep in mind.\n\n195\n00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.020\nYou can play around with it,\nsee how it works out If you like it,\n\n196\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.190\nthen definitely support the open\nsource community because those people\n\n197\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.550\nare spending a lot of their time building\ntools for themselves, but also for you.\n\n198\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:20.300\nSo, that's important, and\nthen there's finally one that,\n\n199\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.360\nif I'm not mistaken, is OS X-only.\n\n200\n00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.270\nWhen I say finally,\nit's not really, there's one more.\n\n201\n00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.590\nSorry, tt was Text Mate.\n\n202\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:34.430\nIt's for OS X only, so I tend to stay away\nfrom this one because I'm using Text Mate\n\n203\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.130\nand you're not on a Mac.\n\n204\n00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.130\nYou're like okay,\nwell how do I do that in my text editor?\n\n205\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.610\nBut if you've already used Text Mate and\nyou like it then definitely do it.\n\n206\n00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.066\nIt has some upgrades just like the other\nones, this website is wicked tiny, though.\n\n207\n00:10:48.066 --> 00:10:50.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's very small.\n\n208\n00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it is a purchase, you can\nuse it for a while, but it's similar.\n\n209\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.710\nI think the pricing model\nis similar to Sublime,\n\n210\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.080\nwhere you want to purchase this\nafter a certain amount of time.\n\n211\n00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:08.080\nAnd then if you're on Windows,\na common one that people may be used to or\n\n212\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.540\nhave used before is Notepad++ and\nnothing else.\n\n213\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.710\nI do like their little logo here,\nthe little chameleon,\n\n214\n00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.080\nhe’s a cutie, I think he is.\n\n215\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.750\nSo, Notepad++ Windows\npredominately Windows,\n\n216\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.780\nI don't think they have changed this to\nhave anything else but Windows installers.\n\n217\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.070\nThat looks to still be the case,\nit has those plug ins and\n\n218\n00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.170\nup grades just like the other one's do.\n\n219\n00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.390\nIt's Windows only I have used it before,\n\n220\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.690\nif this is what you like\nto use definitely use it.\n\n221\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.810\nIt's way better than just notepad for\n\n222\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.030\ndevelopment purposes,\nall these tools are good.\n\n223\n00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.700\nI tend to recommend Adam just\nbecause that's my choice,\n\n224\n00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.870\nmy flavor at the moment,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n225\n00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.420\nSo we have our text editor.\n\n226\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.020\nDownload one of these, pick the one,\n\n227\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.130\nplay around with all of them,\nsee which one fits you the best.\n\n228\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.760\nWe have Chrome downloaded and\nbelieve it or\n\n229\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.910\nnot You're ready to make web apps, right?\n\n230\n00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.390\nAnd notice I said,\nweb apps there, not websites.\n\n231\n00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:11.680\nWebsites tend to be static, web apps can\nemulate full blown desktop applications\n\n232\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.880\nlike enterprise desktop applications,\nthat are managing multi-thousands\n\n233\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.520\nof people companies, and that's why I want\nto emphasize this is, web application\n\n234\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.730\ndevelopment, ours will not be quite to\nthat scale as we look through these.\n\n235\n00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.510\nBut the same principles apply as you\nscale out and has far reaching ability.\n\n236\n00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:33.300\nIn addition to the web development\nenvironment it doesn't limit you to\n\n237\n00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.820\nthat only works on MAC so that only works\non Linux, or only that works on Windows.\n\n238\n00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.790\nIf it's in a web environment\nit's available everywhere,\n\n239\n00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.190\nit's in mobile phones by default.\n\n240\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.690\nNow there are limitations\nof things you can and\n\n241\n00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.740\ncannot do, then we'll try to\nhighlight those as we come to it.\n\n242\n00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.910\nSo now that we have our\nsetup we'll see some\n\n243\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.310\nmore setup as we go when we\nstart to actually build things.\n\n244\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.040\nWe have our setup,\n\n245\n00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.440\nwe have Chrome installed,\nwe're gonna close out all of these.\n\n246\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.560\nI'm gonna leave this single blank page\nopen because we're going to use this for\n\n247\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.329\na different purpose,\n\n248\n00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:13.020\nalso going to look at where can I find\nmore information about these API's.\n\n249\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:20.480\nSo if I type in JavaScript web API,\nMozilla developer network, well its part\n\n250\n00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.879\nof Mozilla which creates Firefox, and they\nkeep fairly robust set of documentation.\n\n251\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.540\nI like these.\n\n252\n00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.210\nIf you actually go back one this will\ngive you kind of an overview of several\n\n253\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.050\nof the technologies that you would\nneed to build full blown web apps\n\n254\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.740\nas well as some of the technologies\nthat are kind of, they're there but\n\n255\n00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.730\nyou won't necessarily be interacting\nwith them in a direct manner.\n\n256\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.200\nLike http that's how things\nare transmitted to and from the browser.\n\n257\n00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.540\nBut you may not be doing low\nlevel HTTP type programming.\n\n258\n00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.690\nYou're depending on\nthat transfer to occur,\n\n259\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.280\njust kind of assuming that it will happen.\n\n260\n00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.880\nAnd then these web APIs,\nthese are the things that are provided\n\n261\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.250\nto us in order to make those\nfull fledged web applications.\n\n262\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.810\nSo, we'll use these documentations.\n\n263\n00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.540\nThis documentation, these documentations.\n\n264\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.020\nThis documentation fairly\nregularly I like it.\n\n265\n00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.950\nIt's really robust but\nit can be overwhelming.\n\n266\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.790\nSo what if I just want a quick look, a\nquick glance into the realm of something?\n\n267\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.020\nSo W3 is the standard But,\n\n268\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.850\nnotice it just keeps coming back\nto like Microsoft and Mozilla.\n\n269\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:36.640\nWhat if I want something a little higher,\nyou know, like 10,000 foot.\n\n270\n00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.010\nI don't want all the details,\nI just want a quick glance.\n\n271\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.986\nIn addition to,\nyou may find if you look into the correct.\n\n272\n00:14:44.986 --> 00:14:49.390\nGoogle incantation is W3Schools.\n\n273\n00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.100\nAnd they have a set of tutorials and\nthey're just like smaller exercises.\n\n274\n00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.698\nBut what I like about them is you\ncome down here to the bottom,\n\n275\n00:14:58.698 --> 00:15:02.530\non the left-hand side, there's references.\n\n276\n00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:07.420\nSo if I look at JavaScript objects,\nWe're actually going to look at these.\n\n277\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.670\nThese are part of the web API.\n\n278\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.420\nThese provide a quicker glance, right?\n\n279\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:17.020\nThis is a list, small descriptions,\nsmall text also, and\n\n280\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.968\nsome things you should know, right?\n\n281\n00:15:19.968 --> 00:15:24.630\nI haven't found it to be\nquite as robust as Mozilla.\n\n282\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.140\nBut sometimes when I just need\nto know something really quick.\n\n283\n00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.840\nThere be three schools, reference, good.\n\n284\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.800\nNow in addition to they offer other things\nlike sandbox environment were you can play\n\n285\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.990\naround and break things and\nnot have to do a lot of set up.\n\n286\n00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.630\nBut we wanna build full fledge web app.\n\n287\n00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.770\nSo you know that's not\ngonna quite work for us.\n\n288\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.450\nBut we're gonna take look\nat all of these right.\n\n289\n00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:52.971\nNot all of these functions, all of\nthese web APIs that are listed here,\n\n290\n00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:56.477\nthese browser objects and\nHTML DOM objects.\n\n291\n00:15:56.477 --> 00:16:00.972\nI've already said Words, that you're\nlike you're just making up words now.\n\n292\n00:16:00.972 --> 00:16:03.910\nSometimes I feel like I'm making up words.\n\n293\n00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.400\nBut don't worry, we'll slowly dive\ninto those as we come to them.\n\n294\n00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.370\nSo, where do we start?\n\n295\n00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.730\nLet's start in the browser.\n\n296\n00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.630\nSo, the browser is kind of your entry\nway into web application development.\n\n297\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.790\nIf you don't have a browser,\nthen you just have some text files\n\n298\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.540\nthat might do stuff if you\nput them together correctly.\n\n299\n00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.310\nSo, the browser provides these objects,\nJavaScript objects,\n\n300\n00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.690\nwhere I can interact and use to build\nthese wonderful interactions for\n\n301\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.590\nthe user, and my webpage does some\ncrazy stuff, those web applications.\n\n302\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.170\nWell, let's see how those are arranged.\n\n303\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.340\nSo, I have a,\nI'm not big super big on diagramming,\n\n304\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.320\nbut I like this hierarchical structure\nbecause these are the things we're gonna\n\n305\n00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.200\ntouch on today and\nsee what are available to me.\n\n306\n00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.720\nSo, I have the window object, that is the\ntop level thing available in the browser.\n\n307\n00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.420\nIt's available everywhere.\n\n308\n00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.140\nIt's what's called the global object.\n\n309\n00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.250\nAnd we're actually gonna\ndive into each one of these.\n\n310\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.070\nWithin that, as sub-properties of this,\n\n311\n00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:12.770\nare the Location object, the History\nobject, the Document object, Navigator,\n\n312\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.070\nScreen, as well as a whole\nbunch of other ones.\n\n313\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:20.850\nBut these represent parts of the browser,\nthis is part of the Browser Object Model.\n\n314\n00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.780\nSo, this is modelling\nthe browser interactions and\n\n315\n00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.500\nbehaviors as these JavaScript objects.\n\n316\n00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.760\nAnd then notice, for the document,\nI have forms, images and links, right?\n\n317\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.200\nSo that document object had\nsubobjects that we'll dive into.\n\n318\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.640\nNow, it kind of blurs after a while\nbecause the document slowly moves into\n\n319\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.700\ninteracting with the webpage, the HTML.\n\n320\n00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.470\nAnd that brings me to something\nI definitely wanna emphasize.\n\n321\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.030\nIf you don't know what HTML is, you\ndon't know what CSS is, you may want to\n\n322\n00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.780\ngo check out some other videos in our\nlibrary to get a good primer on those.\n\n323\n00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.670\nBecause I will be doing some HTML,\n\n324\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.930\nCSS Stuff that you're like I\ndon't know what he's doing.\n\n325\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.070\nEven if you get the JavaScript,\nit may still be nice to have a primer,\n\n326\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.950\nkind of a back fill on that.\n\n327\n00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.030\nSo, here's our organization.\n\n328\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.250\nLet's start with the window object and\n\n329\n00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.530\nsee what is available in\nthe browser on the window object.\n\n330\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:21.040\nWindow object, Daniel, it's kind of weird,\nI don't, like it's the browser window.\n\n331\n00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.456\nBut it's, I don't know, it's,\nsome of these are named odd.\n\n332\n00:18:24.456 --> 00:18:28.960\n&gt;&gt; They typically don't, I've noticed\nthat within many programming languages,\n\n333\n00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.960\nthey don't typically name things that\nare really easily discerned without some\n\n334\n00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.030\nacclimation to their environment.\n\n335\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.850\n&gt;&gt; I think that's true of\nany technical environment.\n\n336\n00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.720\nThey'll start spitting out terms and\nwords and acronyms, and you go,\n\n337\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.470\nthat's when you smile, you grin, you nod,\nand then you go and you start, you search,\n\n338\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.410\nand you ask, and you talk,\nand you play around.\n\n339\n00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.090\nAnd we're actually gonna take\nthe approach of playing around and\n\n340\n00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:58.090\nseeing what's available to us because\nI'm a bit believer in exploration,\n\n341\n00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.130\nfiguring out what's going on.\n\n342\n00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.730\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the Window Object.\n\n343\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.100\nIf we actually type the word Window in the\nJavaScript console, I made an assumption.\n\n344\n00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.080\nHere's my, sorry, my assumption.\n\n345\n00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.350\nI'm gonna open the Chrome developer tools.\n\n346\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.880\nLet me back up, that was my fault.\n\n347\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.470\nI'm gonna go to More Tools\n&gt; Developer Tools.\n\n348\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:22.800\nNow, I'm on a blank page, and\nI have been in the console before.\n\n349\n00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.880\nThere are several tabs here.\n\n350\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.080\nWe want to be in the Console portion.\n\n351\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.290\nIf you come over here, this is\nactually the HTML that's rendered out,\n\n352\n00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.020\nthe elements of the page, the sources.\n\n353\n00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.590\nWe will dig into sources,\nnetwork, timelines, and\n\n354\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.480\nsome of these other ones as\nyou can see in later episodes.\n\n355\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.375\nBut the console is where we\ninteract with JavaScript.\n\n356\n00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:44.620\nS,o we're gonna start there and\n\n357\n00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.990\nwe can interact with the browser\nprogrammatically, but it's gonna be more\n\n358\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.310\npointing and clicking than it is\nJavaScript typing and programming.\n\n359\n00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.360\nSo let's look at that window object.\n\n360\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:01.140\nAnd if I type window and hit Enter,\nwell, this doesn't look too complicated.\n\n361\n00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.810\nBe careful.\n\n362\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.170\nThis is almost like that ark in the\ncovenant scene where people open it and-\n\n363\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.130\n&gt;&gt; Faces start melting.\n\n364\n00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:09.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n365\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.680\nSo, I feel like that sometimes\nwhen I start poking around.\n\n366\n00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.870\nBut exploration is important.\n\n367\n00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:20.550\nIf I hit this drop down, you'll notice,\nthis window object has all kinds of stuff,\n\n368\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:27.280\nand actually provides the JavaScript kind\nof runtime environment within the browser.\n\n369\n00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.910\nBut notice, there's stuff in\nhere that I've never used,\n\n370\n00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.812\nlike there's a game pad sub-function,\nsub-object.\n\n371\n00:20:33.812 --> 00:20:36.980\nWell, I've never used that,\nbut I'm now interested.\n\n372\n00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.670\nNow, I have an impetus.\n\n373\n00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.340\nLet me go find out how do I use\nthe game pad object in the window?\n\n374\n00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.290\nAnd maybe no one has ever done that, or\n\n375\n00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.160\nvery few people have done that,\nor at least documented it well.\n\n376\n00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.790\nThat would be an opportunity for\nyou to become well-versed in something and\n\n377\n00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.210\ncontribute back to the community.\n\n378\n00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.160\n&gt;&gt; Justin's now gonna create\nthe first website that is browsed\n\n379\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.390\nsolely through game pads.\n\n380\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have to pick your\ngame pad with the mouse click, but\n\n381\n00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.080\nafter that it's all controllers.\n\n382\n00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.940\nSo, if I keep looking,\nit's all these data types.\n\n383\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:11.000\nAnd this is actually kind of like the main\nrepository of all of this information.\n\n384\n00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.660\nBut notice that hierarchy\nstructure that I've showed you,\n\n385\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.840\nnotice there's that document thing, right?\n\n386\n00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.250\nThis document object that I talked about.\n\n387\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.940\nWell, this has parenthesis.\n\n388\n00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.150\nThat's a little different.\n\n389\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:28.130\nThese are all functions for\ncreating other objects.\n\n390\n00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.800\nBut if I keep scrolling,\nmy hand's getting tired.\n\n391\n00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.640\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of functions.\n\n392\n00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a lot of stuff.\n\n393\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.660\nIf I come down here, notice I start to\nget into these lower case characters.\n\n394\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.800\nSome of these are still functions,\nbut right here, see this document?\n\n395\n00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.090\nIt is a, it's constructed\nfrom that document function,\n\n396\n00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.370\nbut it is the document object.\n\n397\n00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:55.080\nSo, the window is like your\nview into the world, right?\n\n398\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.300\nIf you're in a tiny room with no windows,\nyou can't see anything.\n\n399\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.810\nBut if you cut a window in the wall,\nyou can look outside and\n\n400\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.270\nsee all the wonderful\nthings available to you.\n\n401\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.530\nAnd I think that's why\nthey name this window, but\n\n402\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.640\nalso because this is a application window.\n\n403\n00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.710\nI like to think of it\nas the first one now.\n\n404\n00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.990\nIt's my view into the world.\n\n405\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.200\nSo what are some important things you\nshould know about the Window object?\n\n406\n00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:24.260\nAny time in JavaScript that you\ncreate kind of global objects or\n\n407\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.950\nvariables or anything else,\nthey get tacked on to that window object.\n\n408\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.410\nWhich, as we start\ndeveloping web applications,\n\n409\n00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.410\nwe'll find that might not\nbe the best thing to do.\n\n410\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.880\nSo let's take a look,\nlittle bit of JavaScript here.\n\n411\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.918\nI'm gonna console.log(window.me).\n\n412\n00:22:41.918 --> 00:22:46.520\nAnd what we're gonna find out\nis (window.me) is undefined.\n\n413\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.420\nOkay, well, I didn't think that\nit would know exactly about me.\n\n414\n00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:55.310\nBut if I say me = 'Justin', and\n\n415\n00:22:55.310 --> 00:23:00.420\nI windowed out me again,\nI have now stored the property Justin,\n\n416\n00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.140\nright, the string Justin,\non the key of me on the window.\n\n417\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.790\nSo that gets pushed to this window object.\n\n418\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.860\nSo anytime you use var,\nyou're adding to the Window object,\n\n419\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.480\nyou're adding to your view of the world.\n\n420\n00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.910\nThat's not always the best case, cuz if\nI wanted to use the variable me again,\n\n421\n00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.950\nwell, could be iffy, could be troublesome.\n\n422\n00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:29.800\nAnd that's where people get into\nthe weird stuff of me1, me2, me3, me467.\n\n423\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.160\nAnd you're, well, which was it,\nwas it 467, or 466 that I was using?\n\n424\n00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.500\nSo, we'll learn the ways to\nkeep that from happening.\n\n425\n00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.180\nBut this window object's\nincredibly powerful.\n\n426\n00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:48.382\nNow, part of that purview into the world\nare the clear function, right?\n\n427\n00:23:48.382 --> 00:23:52.971\nI can clear the console just by\ntyping clear in parentheses.\n\n428\n00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:58.146\nBut also,\nsome of the more annoying things that can,\n\n429\n00:23:58.146 --> 00:24:01.603\nI find them annoying Is like alert.\n\n430\n00:24:01.603 --> 00:24:04.991\nWell, alert just throws a pop-up,\nyou shouldn't do this a great deal.\n\n431\n00:24:04.991 --> 00:24:11.417\nBut, that's part of the window object, and\nthen finally, one that I like is prompt.\n\n432\n00:24:11.417 --> 00:24:14.167\nIt can be annoying, what is your name?\n\n433\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:22.430\nAnd notice I'm just saying prompt and\nit asks me my name.\n\n434\n00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.570\nAnd I'm gonna type my name,\nit's kinda hard,\n\n435\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.690\nI have a hard time zooming\nin on some of those pop-ups.\n\n436\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.690\nWe'll figure that out, and\nthen if I look at name,\n\n437\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.710\nthe prompt actually grabs that\ninformation and puts it back.\n\n438\n00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.905\nBut as you probably know, if you're on\na website that's throwing up a bunch of\n\n439\n00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:40.690\npop-ups like this, I would be wary.\n\n440\n00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.340\nI would be very very weary, I would\nnot answer questions in those prompts\n\n441\n00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.060\nunless you know the source and you're\nabsolutely sure that you know the source,\n\n442\n00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.870\nwho wrote it,\nwhat they're doing with that information.\n\n443\n00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.870\nSo, these are all part\nof the window object,\n\n444\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:00.870\nthese are top level globally accessible,\nbut in addition to\n\n445\n00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:05.510\nthose sub objects like location\nare part of the window object.\n\n446\n00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.220\nBut because they're already attached\nto that window thing, I'm gonna clear.\n\n447\n00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.630\nI can actually just say\nthe name without window dot and\n\n448\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.300\nI get access to the location for instance.\n\n449\n00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:22.420\nThat's our next one that we can use in\nbuilding these APIs and the location,\n\n450\n00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.860\nwell, it's not quite as\noverwhelming as the window object.\n\n451\n00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.200\n&gt;&gt; It's much smaller.\n\n452\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes much smaller, Daniel's like I was\n\n453\n00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.370\ngetting tired just watching you scroll\nthrough the window object and I.\n\n454\n00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.370\n&gt;&gt; The window object is robust.\n\n455\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, robust,\n\n456\n00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:46.500\nI've said that a couple of times, that's\na nice way of saying exhausting sometimes.\n\n457\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.790\nSo what does location provide to us?\n\n458\n00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.830\nIt provides us some\ninformation about where we are,\n\n459\n00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:56.010\nwithin the context of the internet or\nwhat web page we're on.\n\n460\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.570\nRight, so, what is my host name,\nnew tab, okay, href,\n\n461\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.740\nwell I'm in Chrome new tab because I\nhaven't actually navigated to a website.\n\n462\n00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.960\nBut let's go to a website, I'm gonna\nleave the console open, I can do this,\n\n463\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.040\nI'm gonna go to Google, okay.\n\n464\n00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:15.140\nWell, let's look at location, and\nnotice that location has changed\n\n465\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.410\nto tell me a little bit\nabout the site that I'm on.\n\n466\n00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.385\nSo, what is the host name?\n\n467\n00:26:19.385 --> 00:26:20.460\nGoogle.com.\n\n468\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.670\nWhat is its full URL?\n\n469\n00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:26.460\nhref, https://www.google.com,\nits origin and\n\n470\n00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:32.300\nhref sometimes these are a little bit\ndifferent if you poke around inside.\n\n471\n00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:39.210\nBut those are the main things that you\nshould now about, is location href.\n\n472\n00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:43.310\nAnd here's one of the reasons you\ndo not answer questions in prompts.\n\n473\n00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:47.380\nIf I wanted to say location href, and\n\n474\n00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.020\nsay, well I'm gonna send you,\nI'm gonna send us back to Google,\n\n475\n00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:57.421\nactually let's go to\ndeveloper .mozzilla.com.\n\n476\n00:26:57.421 --> 00:27:03.900\nSo I typed in the full URL, set the href\nto it, and if I hit Enter, uh-oh.\n\n477\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.710\nI have now been redirected to a different\npage, so keep in mind, that's available.\n\n478\n00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:12.240\nBecause if you're answering questions from\nsomeone that's throwing those pop-ups,\n\n479\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.340\nyou type it in,\nit can actually take you to places and\n\n480\n00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.960\nuse that information accordingly\nthrough various means.\n\n481\n00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.520\nSo keep safe, be very safe.\n\n482\n00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.640\nOne fun thing that I do with people is\nget them to answer what their name is,\n\n483\n00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.380\ntheir full name in those pop ups and\n\n484\n00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:31.110\nthen I redirect to a Google search to\nshow hey, you probably shouldn't do that.\n\n485\n00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.760\nNow, Daniel, we have a few more\nthings that we need to cover.\n\n486\n00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.620\nBut I'm just not sure we have quite\nthe amount of time that we need to\n\n487\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:39.740\nget all of those done.\n\n488\n00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.710\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI like am man that knows his limitations.\n\n489\n00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.630\nAnd that's easy for us to do,\ncuz all we can do is make one of\n\n490\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.360\nour famous part twos, and\nwe'll finish this out.\n\n491\n00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.450\nSo Justin, you got us thus far,\ntrying to figure out what we can do.\n\n492\n00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:55.550\nHow we can start this whole API business,\nmaking web development work for us.\n\n493\n00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.320\nAnd really setting the stage for that so\n\n494\n00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.740\nwe can continue down this\nroad further in the series.\n\n495\n00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.750\nThat being said, I'll go ahead and\nclose this show, signing off for\n\n496\n00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.080\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n497\n00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.900\n&gt;&gt; and I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n498\n00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:07.936\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n499\n00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.695\n[MUSIC]\n\n500\n00:28:15.695 -->

Francisco.\n\n3\n00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:08.433\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:12.380\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.860\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.770\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.510\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n8\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.160\nseries on web development, web APIs.\n\n9\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.515\nAnd of course,\njoining us back in the studio yet again.\n\n10\n00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:29.053\nRounding out part two on kind of\nan introduction into this whole series,\n\n11\n00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:30.740\nour good friend Mr Justin Dennis.\n\n12\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.450\nAnd Justin,\nwelcome back man how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.320\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, thanks for\nhaving me back Daniel, how are you today?\n\n14\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.171\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:40.050\n&gt;&gt; Well that's good, I always like\nto hear that people are doing well.\n\n16\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.060\nSo, in the last episode,\n\n17\n00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.588\nif you haven't seen part one definitely go\nback in and kind of get up to speed here.\n\n18\n00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.760\nBut, in our last episode,\nwe started in this series of\n\n19\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.810\nweb APIs that are available to us when\nwe're building web applications, right?\n\n20\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.720\nSo, we took a look at\nthe window object and\n\n21\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.130\nwe started diving into\nthe window object a little bit.\n\n22\n00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.570\nAnd we looked at location.\n\n23\n00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.887\nLet's start back at the very\nend of location, so\n\n24\n00:01:04.887 --> 00:01:06.706\nwe can remind ourselves a little bit.\n\n25\n00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:10.199\nAnd then proceed on these\nother dominant objects,\n\n26\n00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:13.134\nthese really high level browser objects.\n\n27\n00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:15.560\nThat are available to us as\nwe're building web applications.\n\n28\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.740\nSo let's go ahead and\nhop inside of our browser.\n\n29\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.664\nNow I haven't I haven't changed anything.\n\n30\n00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:23.724\nI made sure to preserve this\nstate exactly how it was so\n\n31\n00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:26.940\nwe can have some nice continuity here.\n\n32\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.530\nSo, I'm on developer.mozilla.org and\nI have the Chrome Developer Console open.\n\n33\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.597\nSo if I want to make sure that I have\nthat open that’s under More Tools &gt;\n\n34\n00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:36.311\nDeveloper Tools.\n\n35\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.410\nI may end up being on this page.\n\n36\n00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.410\nAnd I got real scared\nwhen I saw all that text.\n\n37\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.628\nAnd I was like, [SOUND].\n\n38\n00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:44.780\nSo we don't want that,\nwe want the console.\n\n39\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.930\nDefinitely stay in the console.\n\n40\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.020\nSo let's go ahead and\nlook at that location object.\n\n41\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.220\nAgain, this is part of the window object.\n\n42\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.340\nBut because it's global, and\nit's part of the window object.\n\n43\n00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.319\nI can just type that name, and\nstill gain access to that object.\n\n44\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.020\nThis is a little nicer to look at.\n\n45\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.820\nI can get the URL, what the origin is.\n\n46\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.200\nAnd then notice now I have a path name.\n\n47\n00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.230\nWhat is the path name?\n\n48\n00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.780\nAnd that is,\nlet me see if I can zoom in here.\n\n49\n00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.580\nThe path name is those slash\nparts after the main domain name.\n\n50\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.730\nSo I can get that.\n\n51\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.210\nI can interact with that.\n\n52\n00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.440\nAlso, protocol, HTTPS.\n\n53\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.100\nWhy is that important?\n\n54\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.340\nWell, maybe I want to make sure\nthat my web app is interacting or\n\n55\n00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.480\nis hosted on an HTTPS host site, right.\n\n56\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.390\nThat means I have secure\nsocket layer protection.\n\n57\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.080\nEverything's encrypted as it comes in and\nout.\n\n58\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.820\nNow, that's a very high level overview.\n\n59\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.290\nThere are maybe some minor nuances,\nthings that are not quite right there.\n\n60\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.380\n&gt;&gt; Kind of glossed over that.\n\n61\n00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.954\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n62\n00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.192\n[LAUGH] Here's some stuff.\n\n63\n00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:46.635\n&gt;&gt; Security.\n\n64\n00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:53.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the endpoint is HTTPS good, HTTP\ncan be good just gotta be careful, right.\n\n65\n00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.190\nSo that's the main takeaway there.\n\n66\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.620\nAnd then we have this href which\nwe can change on the fly, right.\n\n67\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.585\nI can go back to Google by saying href =\n\n68\n00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:11.500\nhttps://www.google, too many os,\ngotta be careful here.\n\n69\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.556\nIt might be one of those spoof\nsites that gets some craziness.\n\n70\n00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:17.669\nAnd notice I'm back at the Google page,\nI'll just pull this over.\n\n71\n00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.587\nSo modifying the href, or the link,\n\n72\n00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:26.690\nthe locations link can make us go to\na different place, redirects are nice.\n\n73\n00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.720\nBut if I look back at location, There's\nalso this other method that may be handy.\n\n74\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.440\nSometimes I just want the page to refresh.\n\n75\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.793\nIf I say location.reload, well actually,\n\n76\n00:03:39.793 --> 00:03:43.951\nit's kind of a flicker there,\nit's kinda hard to see.\n\n77\n00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:46.330\nBut notice this refreshed and\nmy console cleared and\n\n78\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.190\nthat means the entire page refreshed.\n\n79\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.950\nI can programmatically refresh a page.\n\n80\n00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.360\nJust from a user experience point of view,\n\n81\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.580\nmaybe not something you\nwanna do all the time.\n\n82\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.212\n&gt;&gt; Justin, this might not be relevant\nto what we're talking about here.\n\n83\n00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:00.670\nBut I noticed that this Mozilla site and\n\n84\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.860\nGoogle act differently\nin your little window.\n\n85\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.340\nYou slide the window over\nhere it just resizes itself,\n\n86\n00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.680\nwhere Google says no, this is how it is.\n\n87\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what is our target platform?\n\n88\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.640\nThe Mozilla site is definitely\ntrying to make sure that it targets\n\n89\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.235\nmultiple platforms, so\nyou have this rearrangement here.\n\n90\n00:04:18.235 --> 00:04:21.670\nThis is definitely\na styling point of view.\n\n91\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.610\nDefinitely something\nyou should look in to.\n\n92\n00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.670\nYou will see a little bit of that but\na little outside of topic for\n\n93\n00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.460\nwhat is called responsive web design.\n\n94\n00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.525\nSo this is a responsive site.\n\n95\n00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:37.090\nWhereas Google's like, you need\na big screen, you need the big one.\n\n96\n00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.930\nSo a great observation Daniel,\nthanks for pointing that out.\n\n97\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.140\nSometimes I've been in this so long and\nit's like, yeah, that's what it does.\n\n98\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.288\nSo now, we've seen the locations object,\nbut we've been navigating between sites.\n\n99\n00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:50.130\nThere's actually another one\ncalled the history object.\n\n100\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.900\nDaniel, before I hit Enter, I beg of you,\n\n101\n00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.070\nwhat do you think the history\nobject represents?\n\n102\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.358\n&gt;&gt; Something about World War II.\n\n103\n00:04:57.358 --> 00:04:58.526\n&gt;&gt; You're close.\n\n104\n00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:01.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're close.\n\n105\n00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:03.073\n&gt;&gt; That's what\nthe History Channel is all about.\n\n106\n00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:07.410\n&gt;&gt; Well there was a lot going\non during World War II.\n\n107\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.000\nWorld War II is definitely a pivotal\npoint in a bunch of countries' history\n\n108\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.500\non the History Channel.\n\n109\n00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.910\n&gt;&gt; Not so much of our web browser maybe.\n\n110\n00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah not so much on our web browser.\n\n111\n00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.710\nIf you find a World War II\nphotograph with a web browser in it,\n\n112\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.210\nyou should let someone know.\n\n113\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.090\nThat's important.\n\n114\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.600\nSo if I look at this history object,\nit seems very boring,\n\n115\n00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.570\nbut notice it says length.\n\n116\n00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.100\nLength of four, what would length\nmean in the case of history?\n\n117\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.550\nWell history is actually a collection,\nit's an array-like thing,\n\n118\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.970\nit's a collection of sites\nthat you have visited.\n\n119\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.350\nAnd I'm moving back and\nforth between sites by typing in URLs and\n\n120\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.670\nthis gets pushed to the history object.\n\n121\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.120\nNow it's not immediately\nevident what those are.\n\n122\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.170\nBut if we look at this __proto__,\n\n123\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.430\nit says this history object\nis a type of history object.\n\n124\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.020\nYou don't say.\n\n125\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.617\nWell, really what this is,\nis this is a particular instantiation or\n\n126\n00:06:08.617 --> 00:06:12.596\ncreation of a history object\non the window object, right?\n\n127\n00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:17.370\nIt's attached to the global window\nobject but it is of type history.\n\n128\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.314\nSo if we look through, I have a back,\na forward, and a go and\n\n129\n00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:23.780\nI have a push state in state now.\n\n130\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.890\nYou can do some pretty slick stuff\nwith these push state states, right?\n\n131\n00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.050\nThe collection of what websites\nyou've messed around with.\n\n132\n00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.728\nBut it does take some tweaking\nto get an idea of that.\n\n133\n00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:40.680\nWhat's really interesting though, is see\nthis go and this forward and this back?\n\n134\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.333\nWell when you're browsing the websites,\nthere are two little buttons up here.\n\n135\n00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:48.200\nRight?\n\n136\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.860\nThe go, this is your Back,\nthis is your Forward.\n\n137\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.690\nAnd if you click and hold, it actually\ngives you a list of your history.\n\n138\n00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.260\nWell, believe it or\n\n139\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.550\nnot, the history object is\nthe programmatic interface of that.\n\n140\n00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.160\nSo let's see this actually work.\n\n141\n00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.960\nSo if I say history.back,\nI'm back at Google.\n\n142\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.454\nI have now navigated to a previous\nwebsite that I have visited.\n\n143\n00:07:17.454 --> 00:07:23.460\nIf I say history.forward,\nI just moved forward in time.\n\n144\n00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.230\nNow go is actually a way to,\nyou know that list that drops down?\n\n145\n00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:32.793\nI'm gonna say history.go back 2 And\n\n146\n00:07:32.793 --> 00:07:37.711\nI'm back as I open the browser because I\nnavigated two places in the future and\n\n147\n00:07:37.711 --> 00:07:39.550\nthen don't type there.\n\n148\n00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.500\nDon't type there.\n\n149\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.860\nIf I say history go instead\nof negative two but\n\n150\n00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.581\nforward two I'm back two\npages into the future.\n\n151\n00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:55.527\nSo back and forward are actually just\naliases for go one and go minus one.\n\n152\n00:07:55.527 --> 00:08:00.773\nSo those are three functions that can be\nhandy especially if maybe you're playing\n\n153\n00:08:00.773 --> 00:08:06.033\naround or Or if you want to make sure that\nthings are moving in a certain direction.\n\n154\n00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:11.187\nYou want programmatic access to how\npeople are navigating through your site,\n\n155\n00:08:11.187 --> 00:08:14.699\nor maybe you want to disallow\nthe ability to go back for\n\n156\n00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:18.230\na particular reason like\nyou're filling out a form.\n\n157\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.420\nYou ever had those I'm signing up for\na user account and you hit back and\n\n158\n00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.080\nit just kinda wrecks your day?\n\n159\n00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.020\nWell maybe you want to\nbe able to limit that.\n\n160\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.770\nThese are limited though\nin what their capacity.\n\n161\n00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.060\nYou don't get all full out control,\nbut it's good to know that\n\n162\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.820\nthese are the interfaces in\nthe browser that are available to you.\n\n163\n00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.430\nSo we had that history object.\n\n164\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.010\nWe also have this screen object,\nwhich is weird.\n\n165\n00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.990\nHow is that different\nthen the window object?\n\n166\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.660\n&gt;&gt; The screen goes over the window.\n\n167\n00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's to keep mosquitos.\n\n168\n00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.650\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n169\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:51.380\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know mosquitos were\na problem in computers but who am I?\n\n170\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.180\n&gt;&gt; A bug in the program.\n\n171\n00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.130\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n172\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.065\nI never thought, you know it's funny,\nI never thought of it that way.\n\n173\n00:08:58.065 --> 00:09:00.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, the more you know.\n\n174\n00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.720\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n175\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.780\n&gt;&gt; So if we look at screen there's\nactually not a lot of methods on screen\n\n176\n00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.750\nunless you look at the prototype.\n\n177\n00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.740\nBut most of those methods or\n\n178\n00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.900\nthese functions are just providing\nyou access to the properties.\n\n179\n00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.090\nSo what is the available height,\nwhat is the available left part?\n\n180\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.060\nThat's kind of weird.\n\n181\n00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.180\nAvailable top, available width and,\nif I move this in so\n\n182\n00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.750\nthis is 1920 and I call screen again.\n\n183\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.210\nWell this hasn't changed, right.\n\n184\n00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:35.170\nBut why do I have these\navailable verses ultimate?\n\n185\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.060\nThis was a great time to hop into the\ndocumentation and see what those nuanced\n\n186\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.490\ndifferences are, because the name does\nnot illustrate or illuminate hey, why do\n\n187\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.300\nwe have an available height, an available\nwidth, and then just a height and width?\n\n188\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.650\nSo let's go look at the screen\nobject real quick as I practice into\n\n189\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:58.020\nthe documentation scouring that will\nbecome your life as a software developer.\n\n190\n00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.270\nSo Java Script screen web object.\n\n191\n00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:06.660\nSometimes I have difficulty with\nthese incantations so to speak.\n\n192\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.470\nSo notice W3 schools are there, I actually\nwant to look at Window.screen for the web.\n\n193\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.640\nI want some more descriptive detail, so\n\n194\n00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.920\nI'm gonna use Mozilla developer network\nbut if you want a higher level overview\n\n195\n00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.125\nthat will be a three is definitely\nthere and well I made poor decision.\n\n196\n00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:26.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Made a poor decision.\n\n197\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.690\n&gt;&gt; Right with information on that.\n\n198\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's a screen.\n\n199\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.330\n&gt;&gt; You're seeing that formating.\n\n200\n00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.640\n&gt;&gt; So when that happens\n&gt;&gt; Notice it said Window.screen well,\n\n201\n00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.560\nI want more specifics\nabout this screen thing.\n\n202\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.010\nSo I clicked on this link that took\nme to the page that is nothing but\n\n203\n00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.640\na giant list of web APIs.\n\n204\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.210\nNow I could scroll and\nfind S for screen but\n\n205\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.990\nI'm gonna see if I can just,\nthere's screen.\n\n206\n00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.410\nNow, there are times that\nsome of these are influx\n\n207\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.780\nbecause the browser implementation is\nchanging a little bit noticed when we\n\n208\n00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.230\ngo back and we loom at screen\nit has this little bottle.\n\n209\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.870\nThis is an experimental should not be used\nin production so is just coming online\n\n210\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.790\nthere is still some twicks it is\ngood to know that this is available.\n\n211\n00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.980\nBut maybe you're not\ngonna build an app and\n\n212\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.390\nship it using the screen API a great deal.\n\n213\n00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.430\nBut it is nice to play around and\n\n214\n00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.150\nbe aware of some of these APIs\nthat are available to you.\n\n215\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.580\nBecause not everything\nhas to be production,\n\n216\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.600\nsome of it can just be for fun.\n\n217\n00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.510\nSo available height specifies the height\nof screen and pixels minus permanent and\n\n218\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.920\nsemi permanent user interface features\ndisplayed by the operating system,\n\n219\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.670\nsuch as taskbars on windows, okay.\n\n220\n00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.200\nHeight is the absolute height\nof the screen in pixels.\n\n221\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.550\nSo, notice my taskbar is hidden because\nI have a floating dock that I hide.\n\n222\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.760\nI like to have as much\nreal estate as possible.\n\n223\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.180\nOn Windows, or even on Mac, if you If\nyou have that permanently at the bottom,\n\n224\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.560\nthose available height and height will\nbe a little bit different because that\n\n225\n00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.230\nreal estate is taken up by this UI,\nthis interface portion of the screen.\n\n226\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.520\nSo that's good, but\n\n227\n00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.600\nkeep in mind, probably don't wanna use\nthis in the production application.\n\n228\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.290\nSo there's our Screen object.\n\n229\n00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:22.159\nA little way, a nice little way to see\nhow I get into the documentation here.\n\n230\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.890\nSo, I have screen, nice properties,\nbut, maybe not the most useful.\n\n231\n00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:34.600\nI've got two more, I'm going to save\nthe best form, well I have a bias.\n\n232\n00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.390\nThe best for last, but\nthis navigator object.\n\n233\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.210\nNavigator.\n\n234\n00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.500\nDaniel, do you mind taking a guess on\nwhat the next navigator object does?\n\n235\n00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.990\n&gt;&gt; I'll actually be\nserious on this one and\n\n236\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.640\nsay that it navigates from\none site to the next.\n\n237\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.480\nThat would make absolute sense except,\nwell lets just see.\n\n238\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.046\nI like that build up that actually\ndoesn't absolve until later.\n\n239\n00:12:57.046 --> 00:13:00.838\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so navigator Okay,\n\n240\n00:13:00.838 --> 00:13:04.991\nnavigator bluetooth, bluetooth?\n\n241\n00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:09.020\nOkay, geolocation, well,\nthat's kind of weird.\n\n242\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.990\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; Hm, navigator is actually providing\n\n243\n00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.480\na set of interfaces for device features.\n\n244\n00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.350\nThere are limited things I\ncan do with Bluetooth, or\n\n245\n00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.340\nthe GPS Chipset inside of the devices.\n\n246\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.910\nEven if you don't have\na GPS Chipset like my computer.\n\n247\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.440\nWell, we can do some WiFi triangulation,\nIP lookups,\n\n248\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.670\nthings of that nature and\nget pretty close.\n\n249\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:38.040\nI can actually use this geolocation\nto find the current position.\n\n250\n00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.503\nNow, here's like the navigate\nyou maybe viewing,\n\n251\n00:13:41.503 --> 00:13:44.426\nthat's kinda freaky, I don't like that.\n\n252\n00:13:44.426 --> 00:13:45.590\nThat's no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n253\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:46.950\nTurn it off, turn it off.\n\n254\n00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.330\nWell, let's actually\nlook at the geo location.\n\n255\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.270\nNow, I'm gonna look up\nthe coordinates here.\n\n256\n00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.840\nLet's look the geo location and\nsee how this place out.\n\n257\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.928\nWell, you gotta actually type clear.\n\n258\n00:13:57.928 --> 00:14:01.920\nAppropriately so\nnavigator.geolocation.getcurrentposition\n\n259\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.940\nand actually I think it might error\n\n260\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:14.700\nout if I don't do this.\n\n261\n00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.230\nSo when you call this function\non the geolocation object\n\n262\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.400\nget current position\nit's gonna do a look up.\n\n263\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.040\nAnd it's gonna pass the position.\n\n264\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.050\nI'm using a function here which\nis some of those newer things in\n\n265\n00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.580\nJavaScript known as ES6 and\nsometimes is ES 2015.\n\n266\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.880\nWell I just want to\ncouncil log that out and\n\n267\n00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.245\nnotice as soon as I hit it I\nget this little box up here.\n\n268\n00:14:37.245 --> 00:14:44.350\nIt says, Developer.Mozilla.org\nwants to know your location.\n\n269\n00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.790\nI'm trying to access one of\nthese more protected interfaces.\n\n270\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:54.120\nUnless there is a bug or an exploit that\nsomeone has used, geolocation is not\n\n271\n00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.030\navailable by a site unless you\nparticularly give it permission all right?\n\n272\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.790\nIt just can't look up your position and\nsay hey, here's the position.\n\n273\n00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.170\nSo it will ask, do keep in mind,\n\n274\n00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:10.880\nthere are ways to set this as a permanent\nallow in your system settings.\n\n275\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.410\nAnd we'll try to take a look\nat that in just a moment.\n\n276\n00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.970\nNotice where it originates from, also,\nthis little lock mechanism right here.\n\n277\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:22.140\nSo if I hit allow that will\nactually give me a geo position,\n\n278\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.760\nwhich has a time stamp and coordinates,\n\n279\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.950\nand our particular latitude and longitude\nout to a bunch of decimal places.\n\n280\n00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:38.430\nSix well that's fairly accurate latitude\nand longitude, and gives me an accuracy.\n\n281\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.930\nAnd then sometimes\ndepending on the device,\n\n282\n00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.810\nif I actually have a GPS\nlocator like in your phone.\n\n283\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.310\nA lot of smartphones have this,\n\n284\n00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.650\nI can get a speed an an altitude\nwith this geolocation object.\n\n285\n00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.950\nSo that's incredibly powerful.\n\n286\n00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.166\nIt's kind of exciting because a lot\nof these applications depend on you,\n\n287\n00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:58.280\nchecking in or flagging something.\n\n288\n00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.201\nI've always wanted to make a web app\nThat'll work on phones, that'll allow you\n\n289\n00:16:02.201 --> 00:16:06.020\nto do like geocaching without actually\nbuying all the geocaching equipment.\n\n290\n00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:12.093\nSo, we'll see if I might be able to carve\nout some time to play around with that.\n\n291\n00:16:12.093 --> 00:16:16.090\nBut I can't use that interface\nunless permission is given to me.\n\n292\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.688\nIf you click the little lock,\nyou'll notice,\n\n293\n00:16:18.688 --> 00:16:21.460\nhere are some of the things\nthat are available.\n\n294\n00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.745\nLocation, location is\nthat requested set of\n\n295\n00:16:25.745 --> 00:16:30.240\ninformation I have allowed for the site.\n\n296\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.970\nNotice that a lot of mine\nhave allow by default or Ask.\n\n297\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.530\nRight, ask is gonna have that little\npop-up that you've always seen.\n\n298\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.500\nI recommend that you keep these on\nAsk because at least you'll know\n\n299\n00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.300\nwhen a site is trying to access some of\nthese like your camera or your microphone.\n\n300\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.520\nI don't want that just to\nbe available all the time.\n\n301\n00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.440\nSo, keep that in mind,\nthe lock is for your protection.\n\n302\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.360\nThere are some of these that if you\ndon't turn them on, like JavaScript.\n\n303\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.778\nIf you disallow JavaScript,\n\n304\n00:17:01.778 --> 00:17:07.170\nyour browsing experience is going\nto be depleted significantly.\n\n305\n00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.130\nAnd then, notice, you have cookies and\nsome of these other things.\n\n306\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.397\nBut, so, don't worry.\n\n307\n00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:12.928\nJust because it's available,\n\n308\n00:17:12.928 --> 00:17:15.770\nit doesn't mean that it's\nalways available all the time.\n\n309\n00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.148\nSo, the navigator object provides user\nagent information, geolocation, Bluetooth,\n\n310\n00:17:22.148 --> 00:17:26.191\nsome other device interfaces like battery,\nif you're on a mobile device.\n\n311\n00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:30.240\nOr I think actually, you can even get\nbattery information from like a laptop.\n\n312\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.580\nBut you have to give, you gotta say, yeah,\nthat's okay, you can get that information.\n\n313\n00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.620\nThe browser restricts access.\n\n314\n00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.020\nAnd then, finally, we have to look\nat this object that is, actually,\n\n315\n00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.920\nhas some other things called document.\n\n316\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.480\nAnd I save this one because this is\nwhere a lot of the magic occurs.\n\n317\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.480\nNotice when I drop down document,\n\n318\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.230\nthat does not look like the other\nones that we've looked at.\n\n319\n00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.540\nThe document object is\nactually a programmatic\n\n320\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.036\nrepresentation of all of\nthe HTML on the page.\n\n321\n00:18:04.036 --> 00:18:07.950\nSo, if I, notice,\nI'm highlighting this body thing.\n\n322\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.660\nIt is highlighting this page\naccordingly because that is the body.\n\n323\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.860\nIf I highlight the HTML, that's\nthe entire thing, so, it highlights.\n\n324\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:24.483\nIf I drop down and I look at just this u,\nit's kinda hard to, what happened here?\n\n325\n00:18:24.483 --> 00:18:25.596\nThere we go.\n\n326\n00:18:25.596 --> 00:18:29.124\nIt's not gonna let me highlight too much.\n\n327\n00:18:29.124 --> 00:18:32.992\nAnd that's just because that takes\na little bit of rendering processes, but\n\n328\n00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:34.970\nI can highlight some top level things.\n\n329\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.695\nAnd it is a little glitchy\nfrom time to time.\n\n330\n00:18:36.695 --> 00:18:37.863\nSo, this is not in the main way.\n\n331\n00:18:37.863 --> 00:18:40.368\nHow would you wanna interact\nwith this if you wanted to know?\n\n332\n00:18:40.368 --> 00:18:43.969\nAnd that's through the Elements\ntab of your developer tools.\n\n333\n00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.373\nBut the document, I really wanna know\nwhat is available to me on the document?\n\n334\n00:18:48.373 --> 00:18:49.540\nOkay, what does it represent?\n\n335\n00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.920\nWhat are properties and methods upon it?\n\n336\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.020\nSo, I just type document.\n\n337\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.990\nWe actually have to leverage a special\nmethod on the console called dir.\n\n338\n00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.950\nIt's if you've ever listed\na directory in Linux or\n\n339\n00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.150\nuse dir in Python that will make\na list of all the available things.\n\n340\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.580\nIt's pretty much like that.\n\n341\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.713\nAnd I'm going to console.dir(document).\n\n342\n00:19:10.713 --> 00:19:12.400\nNotice, the color has changed.\n\n343\n00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:19.050\nAnd I actually get a more standard\nrepresentation of the document object.\n\n344\n00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:23.420\nThis is the programmatic access to\neverything else that's on the page.\n\n345\n00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.570\nAnimations?\n\n346\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.270\nIt comes from the document model or\nfrom the document object.\n\n347\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.060\nNotice, it also tells\nyou where your URL is.\n\n348\n00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.830\nIt will tell you everything on the page.\n\n349\n00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.190\nWhat it's supposed to look like,\nhow it's supposed to behave.\n\n350\n00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.520\nWhat kind of click,\nmouse-over events are available.\n\n351\n00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.430\nSo, if I mouse over things,\nshould it do something?\n\n352\n00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.930\nAll come from the document object.\n\n353\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:50.520\nSo, we will eventually dig really\ndeep into the document object and\n\n354\n00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.870\nsee how we can use that to\nplay around on websites.\n\n355\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:20:00.420\nBut the three really nice subobjects\nthat come in handy from time to time\n\n356\n00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.980\nis this forms, images, and links.\n\n357\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.790\nSome of these will be empty,\nsome of them will not be.\n\n358\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.970\nNotice images, says HTMLCollection.\n\n359\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.740\nBut what is that thing?\n\n360\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.527\nKind looks like an array-ish type thing.\n\n361\n00:20:17.527 --> 00:20:20.916\nSo, instead of seeing all of these\nfrom the document point of view,\n\n362\n00:20:20.916 --> 00:20:22.470\nlet's access that property.\n\n363\n00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.822\nLet's look at links first.\n\n364\n00:20:25.822 --> 00:20:29.980\nAnd I look at links,\nit will actually grab, of the page I'm on,\n\n365\n00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.350\nit will give me access,\nprogrammatic access to every link.\n\n366\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.566\nI click on a little blue link that takes\nme to Google or takes me to YouTube or\n\n367\n00:20:38.566 --> 00:20:39.526\nanything else.\n\n368\n00:20:39.526 --> 00:20:43.140\nAll of those links on the page\nare now in a collection.\n\n369\n00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.980\nThat I can iterate through grab,\nplay around with, interact with.\n\n370\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.260\nAnd I don want to mention that even\nthough it looks like an array,\n\n371\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.390\nit is not an array.\n\n372\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:59.090\nIt is an HTML collection which\nbehaves a little bit differently.\n\n373\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.830\nBut notice it has a sum of that iterator,\nif you haven't check that are what's new\n\n374\n00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.429\nin ES6 Series, you may wanna go check\nout some of those iterator things.\n\n375\n00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.240\nThis does allow me to iterate using for\nloops.\n\n376\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.240\nSo, I get some of that iterability of\narrays, but not quite all of the power.\n\n377\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.960\nBut we'll play around and\nsee how that works.\n\n378\n00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.340\nBut now every link on the page.\n\n379\n00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.050\nCool!\n\n380\n00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:22.370\nWell, just because I'm\ntrying to build a web apps,\n\n381\n00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.250\ndoesn't mean I couldn't use this to my\nadvantage to do things like web scraping\n\n382\n00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:31.390\nor maybe I need to grab all,\na link aggregator Like news feeds.\n\n383\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.280\nAnd just put them all together.\n\n384\n00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.710\nSo I could use this.\n\n385\n00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:39.180\nBut then there's also document.images.\n\n386\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.830\nAnd notice this one's empty.\n\n387\n00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:46.040\nAnd that's because there are no\nstatic .png image files on this page.\n\n388\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.220\nYou're like, well there's an image.\n\n389\n00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.490\nThat may not be a standard image.\n\n390\n00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.810\nThere's actually a lot of ways to\nrender things to look like images and\n\n391\n00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:58.820\nweb applications but\nare not png, jpg, jpeg,\n\n392\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.480\nany of those gifs, those are fun.\n\n393\n00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.710\nSo, there's nothing on this page.\n\n394\n00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.530\nWe'll actually look at\none in just a moment.\n\n395\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:11.240\nAnd then, document.forms.\n\n396\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.380\nAnd forms are kind of will you put\nan information and click the go button and\n\n397\n00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.650\ndo searches.\n\n398\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:24.010\nSo notice this first one or index one if I\nhover over it, it highlights the search.\n\n399\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.930\nNoticed it is the search form.\n\n400\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.410\nSo if I wanted to interact with\nthis form programmatically and\n\n401\n00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.410\neverything inside of the form.\n\n402\n00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.630\nNotice there's a bunch of input\nbuttons here that you can't see.\n\n403\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:39.180\nBut if you go right there and then\nright there, that little input box Box\n\n404\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.560\nwhere you type stuff is available\ninside of this form object.\n\n405\n00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.060\nSo if I wanna interact with this,\nthis is kind of a shortcut way.\n\n406\n00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.910\nThere are other ways to grab\nthese exact same things.\n\n407\n00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.080\nLet's go look at one that has some images,\n\n408\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.380\nand I know that Google\nalways has this nice little.\n\n409\n00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.820\nIt either has this image or a nice little.\n\n410\n00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.040\nWhat is the?\n\n411\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.610\nWhat is that called, Daniel?\n\n412\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.840\nThe, I don't know,\nI'd have to look that up.\n\n413\n00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.710\nIt immediately left me,\nit was on the tip of my tongue and\n\n414\n00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.920\nI was like, I'm gonna tell them,\nand then I forgot.\n\n415\n00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.420\nIt will happen from time to time.\n\n416\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.740\nBut if we say document.images,\n\n417\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.100\nnotice that Google actually does have\na couple of static images on the page.\n\n418\n00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:23.350\nSo, this is by no means\na complete overview of\n\n419\n00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:29.750\nall the APIs that are in the browser\nto build web applications upon.\n\n420\n00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:34.720\nBut it does provide a great foundation\nas we need to need more and more.\n\n421\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.810\nAnd that's something I\nneed to warn you about.\n\n422\n00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:41.090\nI've had several people, well,\nI need to know Everything there is to know\n\n423\n00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:45.550\nabout web development before I\ntry to build a web application.\n\n424\n00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:49.209\nAnd I strongly say, don't try to do that.\n\n425\n00:23:49.209 --> 00:23:54.273\nBecause as we've seen, there's actually\nan entire page that you can scroll for\n\n426\n00:23:54.273 --> 00:23:59.187\na good like 20 seconds as fast as you can\nof all of the things that are available\n\n427\n00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:02.010\nto you to build applications.\n\n428\n00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.770\nStart small, start with a foundation,\nand start building the pieces.\n\n429\n00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.660\nGetting to know additional\nthings as you need them and\n\n430\n00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.180\nthat's where we're started and\nwe'll start piling on as we go along.\n\n431\n00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that.\n\n432\n00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.630\nIt's like the analogy of a high diver,\nright?\n\n433\n00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.990\nWell, I've never actually\nbeen in a pool before, but\n\n434\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.390\nI'm gonna study these people and\nwatch them swim.\n\n435\n00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:24.121\nWatch them dive and then, I'm sure\nthey'll jump on a little high dive and\n\n436\n00:24:24.121 --> 00:24:25.283\ndo a bunch of flips and land in.\n\n437\n00:24:25.283 --> 00:24:27.983\nI think I'll enjoy the hospital,\nit'll be a good time.\n\n438\n00:24:27.983 --> 00:24:31.247\nYou need to get some acclimation to it and\njust by diving in and\n\n439\n00:24:31.247 --> 00:24:35.727\ndoing small things first, learning some\nbasic foundational knowledge is going to\n\n440\n00:24:35.727 --> 00:24:38.830\nhelp you as we progress\ninto more advanced topics.\n\n441\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:39.974\nJustin did a great job today.\n\n442\n00:24:39.974 --> 00:24:43.285\nWe appreciate you building that\nfoundation, rest, setting the stage.\n\n443\n00:24:43.285 --> 00:24:46.958\nLooking forward to the more\nadvanced topics as well.\n\n444\n00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:49.760\nThat being said, looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n445\n00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.070\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n446\n00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.390\nSigning off for ITPro TV.\n\n447\n00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.450\nI've been your

00:00:08.394\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:12.367\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.024\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:16.760\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.190\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n8\n00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.600\nand in today's episode we are continuing\non with our web development series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.040\nAnd of course, joining me in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.370\nour resident expert on the very topic,\nour good friend, Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n11\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.050\nJustin, welcome back, sir, we're so\nglad to have you in the studio today.\n\n12\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.160\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.130\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610\nWeb development is one of my fortes.\n\n15\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.625\nBut before we get on to that, how are you?\n\n16\n00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:40.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, I've got a little whatever it is,\nback problems.\n\n17\n00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.040\nBut I'll deal with it.\n\n18\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.110\n&gt;&gt; Daniel, it's odd,\nwhen most people ask, how are you?\n\n19\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.890\nThey're not expecting an honest answer.\n\n20\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.579\nHow are you doing?\nI'm good.\n\n21\n00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.640\nSo thanks for being brutally honest.\n\n22\n00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Brutally honest,\n\n23\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.640\nI'm very sorry to hear-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n24\n00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.770\n&gt;&gt; About your lower back problems.\n\n25\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.270\nSuffered from those myself.\n\n26\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.560\nSo today,\n\n27\n00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.370\nwe're gonna dive into actually playing\naround a little bit with development.\n\n28\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.060\nWe're gonna program a little bit, but\nit's not gonna be super in depth.\n\n29\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.010\nIt's more about figuring out what kind\nof tools are at our disposal, right?\n\n30\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.833\nIf someone shows up and says,\nhey I need you to build a house, and\n\n31\n00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:11.519\nhere's a pair of needle nose pliers.\n\n32\n00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:14.614\nYou go, I don't think that's going\nto be enough to get done what I need\n\n33\n00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:15.710\nto get done.\n\n34\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.350\nSo we need to have this toolbox at\nour behest, right, at our disposal.\n\n35\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.960\nSo let's dig in a little bit and\nsee how that goes.\n\n36\n00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.380\nWe're gonna specifically focus\non the document object model.\n\n37\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.930\nNow what is the document object model?\n\n38\n00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.950\nSo if you haven't seen the other\nepisodes definitely take a look at\n\n39\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.190\nthat document object.\n\n40\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.891\nBut the document object model\nis a set of interfaces,\n\n41\n00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:41.683\na set of APIs of where I can\ninteract with HTML, right?\n\n42\n00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:44.900\nThe HTML page using JavaScript.\n\n43\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.464\nI get these JavaScript objects that\nsimulate these elements on the page,\n\n44\n00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:51.388\nlike a paragraph or a heading.\n\n45\n00:01:51.388 --> 00:01:54.904\nThat I can interact with,\nchange, manipulate.\n\n46\n00:01:54.904 --> 00:01:58.030\nAnd pretty much if you can dream\nit you can make it happen.\n\n47\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.080\nNow does that mean that I\ncan easily make it happen?\n\n48\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.840\nWell that's up for debate.\n\n49\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.300\nIt just depends on your forte,\nwhat kind of tools are at hand and\n\n50\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.810\na little bit of persistence.\n\n51\n00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140\nSo we do need to do\na little bit of set up.\n\n52\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.920\nWe're gonna focus on how are we\ngoing to go about developing\n\n53\n00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.020\nthese web applications?\n\n54\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.230\nWe're just playing around today,\n\n55\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.210\nbut setting up an application\nis very important.\n\n56\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.437\nNow, there is a great way to scale\nthese out to incredibly complex,\n\n57\n00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:29.202\nthe scale of Twitter, Facebook,\nLinkedIn, Google, all of those sites.\n\n58\n00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:32.814\nThere's actually a lot going on even for\nthe Google search page,\n\n59\n00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:36.897\nlooks like a single bar, couple of\nbuttons, but there's a lot going on.\n\n60\n00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:38.150\nWe're not quite worried about that.\n\n61\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.957\nThat actually involves setting up servers,\nand services, and databases, and\n\n62\n00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:45.440\nwe're more worried about the front end.\n\n63\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.590\nWe're gonna focus on front\nend web development for now.\n\n64\n00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.225\nBecause that's the easiest to get started,\nand\n\n65\n00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:54.447\nis necessary because if you\ndon't have a working website.\n\n66\n00:02:54.447 --> 00:02:58.718\n[SOUND] Then it doesn't matter how awesome\nyour services, your databases are.\n\n67\n00:02:58.718 --> 00:03:00.170\nNo one's actually gonna\nbe able to use them.\n\n68\n00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.230\nSo, let's start there.\n\n69\n00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.560\nIt's our entryway, our portal,\n\n70\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.200\nour doorway into the world of\nweb application development.\n\n71\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.780\nSo, I do have Chrome open.\n\n72\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.490\nWe'll come to Chrome in just a moment.\n\n73\n00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.750\nBut I do want to step aside,\n\n74\n00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.260\nand I have a folder here that just\nsays Introduction to Web Development.\n\n75\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.850\nWithin that folder I'm\ngonna make a new folder.\n\n76\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.853\nNow for me,\nI typically do this in the command line.\n\n77\n00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:26.653\nBut I don't wanna muddy the waters any, so\n\n78\n00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:29.010\nwe're just gonna use\nthe standard interface.\n\n79\n00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.690\nI'm gonna create a new folder.\n\n80\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.900\nAnd let's call this Document Object Model.\n\n81\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.030\nSo I'm just creating\na folder within that and,\n\n82\n00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.090\njust to zoom in,\njust call it Document Object Model.\n\n83\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.100\nAs I said, I do this on the command line.\n\n84\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.470\nI try to keep my hands on\nthe keyboard much as possible.\n\n85\n00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.459\nYou do this very repetitively,\nmove to the mouse,\n\n86\n00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.461\nyou'll be surprised how\nbad your shoulder hurts.\n\n87\n00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:53.306\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was surprised the first couple of\n\n88\n00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:56.169\ntimes, had to go get a massage,\na couple of adjustments.\n\n89\n00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.000\nAnd now I try to keep my hands\nas little movement as possible.\n\n90\n00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.760\nBut, unless you're doing this eight, ten,\n\n91\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.890\n12 hours a day,\nmaybe that's not a huge issue.\n\n92\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.860\n&gt;&gt; Programming's a rough business,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n93\n00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.221\nYou can't just think you're gonna\ngo in there being all soft.\n\n94\n00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:11.953\nYou gotta work out, you gotta be prepared.\n\n95\n00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:12.843\n&gt;&gt; You gotta train.\n\n96\n00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:13.403\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n97\n00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:18.097\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] So yeah, your dominant\nhand that you use with the mouse,\n\n98\n00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:21.474\nyou may find some soreness\nin your shoulder.\n\n99\n00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.800\nDefinitely take frequent breaks.\n\n100\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.870\nDon't power hour for six hours.\n\n101\n00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.134\nI've done it, it's not good for\nyou, don't do it.\n\n102\n00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.749\nI'm telling you as someone who's done it,\ndon't do it.\n\n103\n00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.240\nBut just keep in mind,\ntake care of yourself, right?\n\n104\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.700\nJust because you're sitting at a desk,\nyou're programming,\n\n105\n00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.215\nyou're interacting with a computer.\n\n106\n00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:41.527\nMake sure you take some time,\nyou get up, walk around, straighten up.\n\n107\n00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:42.463\n&gt;&gt; Do some tai chi.\n\n108\n00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:47.084\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, relax, you might do\nsome yoga if that's your thing.\n\n109\n00:04:47.084 --> 00:04:48.451\nThere's more a lot of falling\ndown in yoga when I do it.\n\n110\n00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:50.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n111\n00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:54.010\n&gt;&gt; So I'm inside of this\nDocument Object Model folder.\n\n112\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.420\nJust as a reminder, I've created this\nfolder, double click it, I'm there.\n\n113\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.780\nI'm gonna create two files, right?\n\n114\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.170\nThis is the two file, the pairing,\nthe dynamic duo, so to speak.\n\n115\n00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.310\nAnd how am I gonna create these files?\n\n116\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.591\nWell I'm actually gonna create these\nfiles from within my text editor.\n\n117\n00:05:12.591 --> 00:05:17.365\nI just wanted to make sure I had this\nfolder made before I open it up in my text\n\n118\n00:05:17.365 --> 00:05:18.400\neditor.\n\n119\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.710\nSo, I'm gonna zoom back out here and\nI'm gonna open up Atom.\n\n120\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.529\nNow I have a shortcut here.\n\n121\n00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:29.429\nYou'll have to go find where it is\non your respective system whether it\n\n122\n00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.347\nbe Linux Windows, or OSX.\n\n123\n00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:36.150\nIt's the nice pretty little icon that\nkind of looks like a nucleus, an atom.\n\n124\n00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.630\nSo, I have this here, and\nhere is my Atom text editor.\n\n125\n00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.710\nI'm gonna close out all of these windows,\nand full screen it,\n\n126\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.690\nand then I'm gonna add\nthat project folder.\n\n127\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.590\nSo I'm adding this project\nfolder which is on my desktop.\n\n128\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.580\nThat's where all respectable web\ndevs put all of their projects.\n\n129\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.320\nI'm being facetious, don't do that.\n\n130\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.180\nMake sure you have an appropriate\norganization scheme.\n\n131\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.970\nAnd then I have this open.\n\n132\n00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.240\nNotice I did Add Project Folder,\nand I went and found the folder.\n\n133\n00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.710\nAnd I opened the folder, so\n\n134\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.760\nnow any files contained within that\nfolder are available to me within Atom.\n\n135\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.530\nWell there's nothing in there.\n\n136\n00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.631\nWell how do I do then?\n\n137\n00:06:13.631 --> 00:06:18.360\nIf you Ctrl+Click on a Mac or\nright click on a Windows computer.\n\n138\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.213\nAtom provides you an interface for\ncreating new files and\n\n139\n00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:22.705\nfolders within that folder.\n\n140\n00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:24.657\nLet me see if I can zoom in on this.\n\n141\n00:06:24.657 --> 00:06:28.830\nSo I have New File, New Folder,\nDuplicate, Delete, Add Project Folder.\n\n142\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.600\nI have several options available to me.\n\n143\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.440\nI'm going to create a new file.\n\n144\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.983\nAnd I'm going to use\na convention that is used.\n\n145\n00:06:35.983 --> 00:06:39.640\nIt's been around forever,\nas far as I know.\n\n146\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.020\nIt may not be forever.\n\n147\n00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.270\nBut we're going to call this index.html.\n\n148\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.770\nAnd notice, well, why is it indexed?\n\n149\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.130\nThat was a convention that\nwas used a long time.\n\n150\n00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.520\nAnd has kind of persisted around.\n\n151\n00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.190\nThat is the entry point, hey,\nthere's the front door so\n\n152\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.010\nto speak of your web application.\n\n153\n00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.400\nSo definitely use that.\n\n154\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.987\nSo there is my index.html.\n\n155\n00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:06.190\nAnd then I'm going to\ncreate another file and\n\n156\n00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.920\nthis is going to be our JavaScript file.\n\n157\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.630\nThis is how we're going to interact\nwith that page programmatically.\n\n158\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.510\nSo I'm gonna say app.js,\nbecause that's our application.\n\n159\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.620\nOkay, so now we're set.\n\n160\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.370\nYour cursor will probably\nnot look like this.\n\n161\n00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.430\nI have a plugin for\nAtom that makes this cursor happen.\n\n162\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.185\nIf you ever want to learn how\nto turn your plugins on and off.\n\n163\n00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:33.403\nYou can go to the Preferences tab,\ngo to Packages, and\n\n164\n00:07:33.403 --> 00:07:38.558\nI'm actually going to turn that off\nbecause it is my venmo plug in.\n\n165\n00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.627\nAnd sometimes I still get\na little turned around in vem.\n\n166\n00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.283\nLike when my caps lock's on and\n\n167\n00:07:43.283 --> 00:07:46.930\nI accidentally delete my entire file and\nthen it's just a bad time.\n\n168\n00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.750\nSo I'm going to turn that off.\n\n169\n00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.888\nBut you can search for additional\nplugins and packages, which I do have.\n\n170\n00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.748\nAnd I recommend you take a look at for\nyour respective editor,\n\n171\n00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:56.787\nwhether it be Atom, Sublime, or the such.\n\n172\n00:07:56.787 --> 00:08:00.050\nSo, I now need to create\nkinda my entry point.\n\n173\n00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.024\nIn Atom, if you type html And\nyou hit Enter.\n\n174\n00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:08.765\nAutocomplete kind of a templated HTML file\nso you don't have to know that a lot.\n\n175\n00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:10.230\nYou should know what these do.\n\n176\n00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.410\nAgain, go back, and do some research.\n\n177\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.176\nWe have some courses in the course\ncatalogue for basic HTML and CSS.\n\n178\n00:08:17.176 --> 00:08:22.000\nAnd we're just gonna give this\na title of Document Object Model.\n\n179\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.834\nAnd we're gonna give it a heading\nof Document Object Model.\n\n180\n00:08:27.834 --> 00:08:34.074\nAnd then right before the end of\nthis /body, I'm gonna create script,\n\n181\n00:08:34.074 --> 00:08:39.107\nand inside of that script\nI'm gonna say src \"app.js\".\n\n182\n00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:44.972\nAnd that's gonna bring in my application\nthat is in my javascript file, my app.js.\n\n183\n00:08:44.972 --> 00:08:48.473\nIt's gonna bring it in onto this page and\nrun it.\n\n184\n00:08:48.473 --> 00:08:51.382\nNow I can monitor how that runs and\ntweak it, but for\n\n185\n00:08:51.382 --> 00:08:54.710\nnow we just want it to run on page load so\nwe'll leave it be.\n\n186\n00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.590\nWe are actually set up, except I need\nthis to be open inside of Chrome.\n\n187\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.540\nSo let's hop over into Chrome,\nwherever Chrome is,\n\n188\n00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.400\nlet me rearrange those windows real quick.\n\n189\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.340\nMove this over here and there we go.\n\n190\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.236\nSo now in Chrome I wanna open the file and\nI'm gonna browse to that index.html\n\n191\n00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:19.950\nthat is inside of\nthe Document Object Model project.\n\n192\n00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.850\nAgain this is just for exploration.\n\n193\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.050\nThis is not a full fledged\nweb application yet.\n\n194\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.888\nWe'll get there.\n\n195\n00:09:26.888 --> 00:09:27.782\nAnd I'm gonna open the dev tools.\n\n196\n00:09:27.782 --> 00:09:31.235\nI used a keyboard shortcut.\n\n197\n00:09:31.235 --> 00:09:33.720\nBut it's definitely under\nMore tools &gt; Developer tools.\n\n198\n00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.900\nSo we're good to go.\n\n199\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.860\nI need to make sure it's wired up.\n\n200\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.968\nI know I have this index.html open, but\n\n201\n00:09:40.968 --> 00:09:43.703\ndo I know if this app.js\nis running appropriately?\n\n202\n00:09:45.881 --> 00:09:50.506\nI've been doing this for a while,\nand I still find myself,\n\n203\n00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:53.289\njust don't do that, that's bad.\n\n204\n00:09:53.289 --> 00:09:55.359\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I still find myself breaking\n\n205\n00:09:55.359 --> 00:09:57.530\nthings all to pieces.\n\n206\n00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.230\nThis simple log statement so,\nif I refresh,\n\n207\n00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.480\nI know that these are hooked\nup together appropriately.\n\n208\n00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.520\nAnd, if you do that you can\nsee that it prints out work.\n\n209\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.320\nSo we're good to go.\n\n210\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.800\nWe can now interact with our page.\n\n211\n00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.011\nSo, this DOM thing.\n\n212\n00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:12.910\nWhat is the DOM?\n\n213\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.140\nOr the DOM is the shortened\nform of Document Object Model.\n\n214\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.700\nIf we remind ourselves of\nthe document object, well it's this.\n\n215\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.392\nBut notice everything within it is\neverything that's on the page, right?\n\n216\n00:10:27.392 --> 00:10:30.690\nThis is a more simplified\nform than we saw before.\n\n217\n00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.350\nAnd notice I have access to\neverything that's in the document.\n\n218\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:39.520\nWell, this model, this set of APIs, allows\nme to grab references to like this H1.\n\n219\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.040\nAnd then just grab it out, manipulate it\nwith JavaScript, put it back, update it.\n\n220\n00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.380\nAll kinds of fun stuff.\n\n221\n00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.860\nSo how do we actually go about doing that?\n\n222\n00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.757\nWe do need to know a little bit about\nCSS selectors, but just bear with me.\n\n223\n00:10:53.757 --> 00:10:57.490\nIt'll probably make sense in\ncontext of how we're using these.\n\n224\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:05.490\nSo let's just add a little bit to our\nhtml so we can see how things are going.\n\n225\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:12.510\nI'm going to add a paragraph of some\nstuff, or some things, or whatever.\n\n226\n00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:17.980\nNone of these content is going to be\nmeaningful, just a quick disclaimer.\n\n227\n00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.030\nDon't think this is like the secret\nto life or anything like that.\n\n228\n00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.218\nSo on this paragraph I'm going to\nadd an attribute called an ID.\n\n229\n00:11:24.218 --> 00:11:29.037\nThis is a common thing that you will\nsee in web development cuz I wanna grab\n\n230\n00:11:29.037 --> 00:11:33.080\nthis particular one,\nan ID should be unique.\n\n231\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:40.710\nI shouldn't have a bunch of IDs of,\nlet's just call this one, paragraph one.\n\n232\n00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.487\nI shouldn't have ID one six\ntimes on the same page.\n\n233\n00:11:43.487 --> 00:11:47.932\nAnd you can think about that it,\nyou don't want a bunch of people with your\n\n234\n00:11:47.932 --> 00:11:51.878\ndriver's license or your photo\nidentification card just out and\n\n235\n00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.740\nabout using your name willy-nilly, right?\n\n236\n00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.400\nYour ID should be specific,\nit should be your ID.\n\n237\n00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.660\nJust like the ID for\nthis paragraph should be unique.\n\n238\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.450\nAnd that comes in because these\nAPIs depend on that uniqueness.\n\n239\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.050\nI should have a unique paragraph.\n\n240\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.382\nSo, if we go back and look at our\nChrome and we'd refresh you can see,\n\n241\n00:12:12.382 --> 00:12:19.980\nthough it is tiny, And you accidentally\nbackspace, I do have that on here.\n\n242\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.100\nLet me see if I can zoom\nthis in a little bit.\n\n243\n00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.160\nYeah, there we go.\n\n244\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.660\nSo there's my paragraph.\n\n245\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.390\nCool, it's in the document,\nit's in the HTML.\n\n246\n00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.260\nThat's nice, this is, you know,\nI'm just making a website.\n\n247\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.660\nBut how do I go about\ngrabbing this paragraph?\n\n248\n00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.790\nSo, on the document object I have\naccess to a series of methods\n\n249\n00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.500\nthat allow me to pluck\nthese out of the document.\n\n250\n00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.040\nGrab them out of the HTML and\nthen use them.\n\n251\n00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.040\nSo let's do this and I'm gonna\nperiodically mix in some of these new\n\n252\n00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.260\nJavaScript features because I like them.\n\n253\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.690\nAnd you should be aware of them also.\n\n254\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.340\nI don't want this to be de-referenced.\n\n255\n00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.900\nI want this to be this one\nparagraph all the time and\n\n256\n00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.620\nnot accidentally change to a number.\n\n257\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.500\nSo I'm going to use const here.\n\n258\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.790\nSo, I'm gonna say paraOne and\nI'm gonna call the document object.\n\n259\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.100\nThere are other JavaScript run times\nwhere document is not defined.\n\n260\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.780\nThis is only available in the browser.\n\n261\n00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.399\nThis is one of those browser objects.\n\n262\n00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.390\nAnd I can say, getElementById.\n\n263\n00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:26.720\nThey're very lengthy,\nalso spelling matters, right?\n\n264\n00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.840\nLower case, upper case, upper case,\n\n265\n00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.710\nupper case, also known as camel casing,\ntiny head humps along.\n\n266\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.650\nSo what is the ID?\n\n267\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.420\nWell it has the ID of one and there it is.\n\n268\n00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.081\nSo let's go see what's actually\nstored in this variable now.\n\n269\n00:13:47.671 --> 00:13:49.840\nWhoops, there you go.\n\n270\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.800\nAnd if I refresh,\n\n271\n00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.840\nyou'll notice it actually just looks\nexactly like we have written in our HTML.\n\n272\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.210\nExcept there's something\na little different.\n\n273\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:06.880\nLet's use that dir command to\nget a little more information.\n\n274\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.490\nSo, if I refresh,\nnotice it has changed to p#one.\n\n275\n00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:18.150\nThat hashtag is a CSS\nselector that means ID.\n\n276\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.200\nAnd I now have all of these attributes\n\n277\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.820\nthat I can use on this\nparticular paragraph.\n\n278\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.602\nNot all the other paragraphs,\nthis particular one that is called one.\n\n279\n00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:33.860\nSo I have all these methods and\nwe'll learn about these more in time.\n\n280\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.060\nBut notice I have outerHTML.\n\n281\n00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.200\nOkay, that's a property.\n\n282\n00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.390\nOuterText, that's some stuff.\n\n283\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.190\nNotice that's what's inside\nof the paragraph text.\n\n284\n00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.620\nI wonder, could I manipulate that?\n\n285\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.160\nHm, we'll see in just a moment.\n\n286\n00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.780\nSo if I keep going,\nI have some text content.\n\n287\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.644\nAnd notice, down here at\nthe bottom there's a __proto__.\n\n288\n00:14:56.644 --> 00:15:02.260\nThis will tell you more specifically,\nwhat is this thing?\n\n289\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.300\nWell, it is an html paragraph element.\n\n290\n00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.300\nWell, luckily Chrome's right, and\n\n291\n00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.620\nif I drop that down, it will give\nme other things that I can do.\n\n292\n00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.590\nSo I'm gonna hit the high level, like\nyou know, again those foundations that\n\n293\n00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:20.330\nare nice to know I will not cover\nevery last portion of these.\n\n294\n00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.100\nAnd you may never need these.\n\n295\n00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.070\nBut we will cover a good portion of those.\n\n296\n00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.350\nThe things that are important, rather.\n\n297\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.290\nSo let's do something.\n\n298\n00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.320\nLet's see what we can do with these.\n\n299\n00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.560\nSo I'm gonna come back to here,\nand get rid of this.\n\n300\n00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.120\nI'm just gonna have this\navailable in my console.\n\n301\n00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.840\nSo, if I say paraOne, I have it, cool.\n\n302\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.040\nSo, if I say para, now,\nkeep an eye over here,\n\n303\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.401\nit's kinda you've gotta split your eyes\na little bit, so, be careful there.\n\n304\n00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:56.530\nparaOne.textcontent = Something else.\n\n305\n00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.820\nYou ready, Daniel?\n\n306\n00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.465\n&gt;&gt; Dazzle me.\n\n307\n00:15:58.465 --> 00:16:01.006\n&gt;&gt; Keep, there it is\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n308\n00:16:01.006 --> 00:16:03.100\n&gt;&gt; I've actually changed it,\nso I've updated.\n\n309\n00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.860\nNow, what's really weird, is text content.\n\n310\n00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.390\nIf I refresh, it does not persist, right?\n\n311\n00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.370\nThis is static.\n\n312\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.280\nI've changed it dynamically\nwith JavaScript.\n\n313\n00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.994\nIf I want it to persist, I actually have\nto change it permanently on the page.\n\n314\n00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:22.850\nOr I have to have some way that\nthat update is always persisted.\n\n315\n00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.620\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n316\n00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.360\nYou're doing these\nchanges with JavaScript.\n\n317\n00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.806\nThat does not guarantee on page\nrefresh that they will remain there.\n\n318\n00:16:28.806 --> 00:16:32.755\n&gt;&gt; Now, Justin, as an end user, someone\nthat's not the developer of this site,\n\n319\n00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:35.110\nwould they be able to open\nthe developer tools and\n\n320\n00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.710\nmake these changes dynamically like that?\n\n321\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.300\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n322\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.430\nLet's take a look at\na common website here.\n\n323\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.840\nAnd it does bring up a concern.\n\n324\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:52.550\nSo if I look, actually,\nlet's just modify the body.\n\n325\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.530\nSo, the body of the HTML.\n\n326\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.200\nSo, Google's page is structured\nvery much like this.\n\n327\n00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:57.970\nSo, there's the body.\n\n328\n00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:05.640\nSo, if I say document.body, I actually\nget the entire body of the page.\n\n329\n00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.960\nIf I say document.body,\n\n330\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.370\nand suspend your disbelief,\nthis is answering your question.\n\n331\n00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.999\nWe'll see some more of these in time.\n\n332\n00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:21.800\nAnd I say style.backgroundColor equals\none of my favorite colors, chartreuse.\n\n333\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.630\n&gt;&gt; That's fun to say.\n\n334\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.500\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n335\n00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.160\nChartreuse and salmon.\n\n336\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.790\nSalmon is also a valid web color.\n\n337\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.290\nYou ready?\n\n338\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.930\nAnd I've actually turned\nGoogle to chartreuse green.\n\n339\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.890\nWell, did I change Google for everybody?\n\n340\n00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.498\nWell, actually on page refresh\nthat does not persist.\n\n341\n00:17:39.498 --> 00:17:44.290\nThat is a dynamic change that doesn't\npersist other than that single session.\n\n342\n00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.760\nSo that is a good question.\n\n343\n00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.480\nYou can play around,\nyou can actually play around and\n\n344\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.530\ndo all kinds of fun\nstuff with the websites.\n\n345\n00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.830\nIt's just you're not changing it for\nanybody else other than yourself.\n\n346\n00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.850\nSo you can definitely play\naround in the console.\n\n347\n00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.860\nI do that from time to\ntime just to pass time.\n\n348\n00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.480\nSo I have this pair one.\n\n349\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.227\nI changed the text content, but\n\n350\n00:18:05.227 --> 00:18:10.290\nI noticed there was this other thing\ncalled inter-text that I could change.\n\n351\n00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.661\nAnd let's see something else.\n\n352\n00:18:14.661 --> 00:18:18.370\nThat does the exact same\nthing as text content.\n\n353\n00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.600\nAnd in this case,\nthere's another one called inner HTML.\n\n354\n00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.938\nWell, if they all do the same thing,\nthen why do we have multiple ones?\n\n355\n00:18:27.938 --> 00:18:31.560\nWell, I had that exact same question,\nso I did a little bit of look up.\n\n356\n00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.830\nThis is apparently persisting from older\nbrowser implementations that are still\n\n357\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:39.279\nthere, because it breaks\nsome other websites.\n\n358\n00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:46.440\nThis is actually slower by about a factor\nof ten, than modifying text content.\n\n359\n00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.145\nSo, if you change the text content,\nlet's say it takes 10 milliseconds.\n\n360\n00:18:50.145 --> 00:18:51.870\nInter-text may take 100 milliseconds.\n\n361\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.220\nAnd that doesn't sound like a lot.\n\n362\n00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.470\nBut if I need to modify the content\nof 10,000 paragraphs, well,\n\n363\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.170\nthat's a difference of 10\nseconds versus 100 seconds.\n\n364\n00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.842\nSo, 10 seconds, though unbearable\nin the context of surfing websites,\n\n365\n00:19:06.842 --> 00:19:09.764\nis nowhere near unbearable as 100 seconds.\n\n366\n00:19:09.764 --> 00:19:10.849\nAnd you're like!\n\n367\n00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:13.495\nNow, I don't know if I did the math\nright there, but that was for\n\n368\n00:19:13.495 --> 00:19:14.770\nillustrative purposes only.\n\n369\n00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:19.320\nSo, we'll deal with some\nmore in modifying these, but\n\n370\n00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.410\nwe're worried about this Document Object\nModel, how we can interact with these.\n\n371\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.850\nSo, I have this document\nnugget element by ID.\n\n372\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.800\nThere's actually another way\nto get this exact same thing.\n\n373\n00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:37.850\nIt's equivalent in nature, and this is\nthe way I typically interact with the DOM.\n\n374\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.123\nSo paraOneAgain, and\n\n375\n00:19:41.123 --> 00:19:46.122\nI say document.querySelector.\n\n376\n00:19:46.122 --> 00:19:52.620\nAnd so, I'm querying the DOM,\nthe document, the HTML, for something.\n\n377\n00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.580\nAnd I have to use, The css selector.\n\n378\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:02.140\nSo, if we compare these two, and actually\nlet's console log both of these out.\n\n379\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:08.920\nparaOne, and let's just copy that,\nparaOneAgain.\n\n380\n00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:15.270\nIf I refresh, they are actually\nthe exact same HTML element.\n\n381\n00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.550\nI have a reference to the exact same one,\nbut I did it in a different way.\n\n382\n00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.460\nAnd this is one of those difficult\nthings in web development.\n\n383\n00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.330\nPeople will come to me,\ndid I do this right?\n\n384\n00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:25.860\nDoes it work?\n\n385\n00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.170\nYeah, it works.\n\n386\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:33.680\nThen, cool, you have found one of\nthe possible 10,000 ways to do it.\n\n387\n00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.960\nGet element by ID.\n\n388\n00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:41.366\nNotice the one difference is I said one,\nthat's looking for an id with one.\n\n389\n00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:46.355\nQuery selector uses this hashtag,\nwhich in CSS says,\n\n390\n00:20:46.355 --> 00:20:49.290\nhey, I'm looking for an id.\n\n391\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:54.180\nSo, hashtag one is the same as\nsaying it has the id of one.\n\n392\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.820\nI use the query selector,\n\n393\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.170\nbecause query selector ends up providing\nyou with a more uniform interface.\n\n394\n00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.440\nI show you both of these because\nthese will crop up from time to time\n\n395\n00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.120\ndepending on other applications and\nreading that you do.\n\n396\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.030\nSo, these are equivalent in nature,\nthey provide the exact same thing for\n\n397\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.770\nour purposes at this current time.\n\n398\n00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.775\nWe may find some nuanced\ndifferences later on.\n\n399\n00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:22.155\nNow, what happens if I don't\nreally want that one particular\n\n400\n00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:26.820\nparagraph, I want all of\nthe paragraphs on the page?\n\n401\n00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.420\nRight now, I have one,\nbut let's change that.\n\n402\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.034\nLet's say paragraph times 30.\n\n403\n00:21:33.034 --> 00:21:34.510\nI now have 30 paragraphs.\n\n404\n00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.840\nI'm gonna leave the text empty so\nthey're not gonna render on the page,\n\n405\n00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.850\nwhich is very possible for\nwebsites you visit.\n\n406\n00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.680\nThere's elements there that\ndon't have anything in them\n\n407\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.500\njust waiting to get something\nput in them programatically.\n\n408\n00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.020\nSo I have 30 of them.\n\n409\n00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:52.830\nWell, the first instinct,\nI know how to get it by ID, so\n\n410\n00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:57.340\nI'm gonna give these IDs of one and\ntwo and three and four.\n\n411\n00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.530\nAnd then, I wanna make a bunch of\nvariables called paraOne, paraTwo,\n\n412\n00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.270\nparaThree, para.\n\n413\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.410\nI got tired just thinking about\nthat trying to convey that to you.\n\n414\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.240\nDon't do that.\n\n415\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.160\nThere's better ways, right?\n\n416\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.820\nWell, maybe,\n\n417\n00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.490\nI say right like you already know, but\nI'm here to show you that there are.\n\n418\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:19.165\nSo if I say I want all the paragraphs,\nthere's a couple of ways to do that.\n\n419\n00:22:19.165 --> 00:22:23.519\nSo document.getElements.\n\n420\n00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:28.902\nNotice there's an elementsByTagName.\n\n421\n00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.420\nThose are long method names.\n\n422\n00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.630\nAgain, camel casing,\nsmall head, humps along.\n\n423\n00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.340\nNotice this is singular,\nelement, this is plural.\n\n424\n00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.250\nI wonder, am I gonna get the same\nexact thing, and am I gonna get\n\n425\n00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:48.750\nthe paragraph as a single element,\nor if I'm gonna get something else?\n\n426\n00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:53.960\nAnd this actually is asking what tag,\nHTML tag, are you looking for?\n\n427\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:59.500\nSo, let's just console.log and\nlook at paragraphs.\n\n428\n00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.960\nWe've kinda seen that from some\nof the other document stuff,\n\n429\n00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.890\nit's actually an HTML collection.\n\n430\n00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.410\nIf I scroll down,\nan HTML collection has a.\n\n431\n00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.980\nIt has an iterator property.\n\n432\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.371\nBut it is not an array.\n\n433\n00:23:16.371 --> 00:23:20.870\nIt is a collection of HTML\nelements that I can interact with.\n\n434\n00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.470\nSo there's that paragraph.\n\n435\n00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.280\nThere's that paragraph.\n\n436\n00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.900\nAnd notice they stack\non top of each other,\n\n437\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.780\nbecause they don't have\nany content in them.\n\n438\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.960\nSo, okay, I have now had all of these.\n\n439\n00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.610\nIf I wanted to modify\nall of these at once,\n\n440\n00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.340\nI wanted to change all of these\nparagraphs to have red text,\n\n441\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.830\nI can now use iterators,\nfor loops, the dot values,\n\n442\n00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:45.840\nthe symbol.iterator, and run through those\nand modify all of those one at a time.\n\n443\n00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.730\nBut I don't have to handle\nthem one at a time.\n\n444\n00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.230\nI write a loop, and it does it for me.\n\n445\n00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:55.274\nSo notice, this gives you a hint,\nit has an s in it.\n\n446\n00:23:55.274 --> 00:23:57.560\nThe hint is, hey,\nthis is gonna be a collection.\n\n447\n00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.282\nI'm gonna get an array-ish,\nan array like thing, not a single element.\n\n448\n00:24:02.282 --> 00:24:06.137\nBut just like in the getElementById and\nquerySelector,\n\n449\n00:24:06.137 --> 00:24:10.242\nthis is not the only way to get\nall the paragraphs on the page.\n\n450\n00:24:10.242 --> 00:24:14.230\nAnd you're like,\nyou're just, I don't know.\n\n451\n00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.850\nTrust me, we'll unify this more.\n\n452\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.370\nThis is more for informative purposes.\n\n453\n00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.664\nI tend to go with the querySelector, and\n\n454\n00:24:22.664 --> 00:24:27.462\nwith this one as such, paragraphs, again,\n\n455\n00:24:27.462 --> 00:24:31.018\ndocument.querySelectorAll.\n\n456\n00:24:31.018 --> 00:24:32.715\nI want all of them.\n\n457\n00:24:32.715 --> 00:24:34.650\nAnd that's a p tag.\n\n458\n00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.246\nAnd let's see what those paragraphs,\n\n459\n00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:44.057\nyou gotta spell [CROSSTALK] [NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:24:44.057 --> 00:24:45.559\n&gt;&gt; Paragraphs.\n\n461\n00:24:45.559 --> 00:24:48.786\nThere I go again, there I go again.\n\n462\n00:24:48.786 --> 00:24:52.090\nAll right, so if I refresh,\nthis looks very similar.\n\n463\n00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.573\nWe should always inspect to make sure\nwe get the exact same data type,\n\n464\n00:24:55.573 --> 00:24:57.025\ncuz maybe it's different.\n\n465\n00:24:57.025 --> 00:24:58.610\nAha, a NodeList.\n\n466\n00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:04.780\nMm, well, the querySelector and the\ngetElementById, those looked very similar.\n\n467\n00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.860\nWe should, this tells me,\nwe might want to go back and\n\n468\n00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.570\nlook at those just to make sure.\n\n469\n00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:14.850\nBut what is a NodeList in\ncomparison to an HTMLCollection?\n\n470\n00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.930\nWell, if we look at what a NodeList is,\n\n471\n00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:21.170\nnotice I get a little more\navailable to me right off the bat.\n\n472\n00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.665\nI get a foreach, I get entries and values.\n\n473\n00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:31.400\nI find the NodeList to be a little easier\nto work with than HTMLCollections.\n\n474\n00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.330\nAnd are a little more array-like\nthan HTML collections.\n\n475\n00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.720\nThat is why I tend to prefer\nquerySelector and querySelectorAll.\n\n476\n00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.930\nSelector, one, you get one element.\n\n477\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.580\nIt is actually the first\ninstance of that element.\n\n478\n00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.460\nAnd I'll illustrate that in just a moment.\n\n479\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:53.050\nquerySelectorAll gives me all of\nthem that satisfy this criteria.\n\n480\n00:25:54.168 --> 00:25:58.590\nIf I give it a hashtag, well,\nI get the thing with the ID.\n\n481\n00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:04.810\nIf I give it just a standard HTML tag,\nI get all of those tags if I'm using all.\n\n482\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.716\nBut what if I take off the all?\n\n483\n00:26:06.716 --> 00:26:09.206\nI'm gonna leave everything else the same.\n\n484\n00:26:09.206 --> 00:26:10.916\nAnd I refresh.\n\n485\n00:26:10.916 --> 00:26:14.330\nI get the first paragraph,\nI don’t get all of them.\n\n486\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.490\nSo, as soon as it hits a paragraph tag,\nboom!\n\n487\n00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.570\nIt spits it out, that's what you got.\n\n488\n00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.857\nSo, we've seen how to interact with\nthe DOM, but you know, Daniel,\n\n489\n00:26:22.857 --> 00:26:26.280\nwe've got a couple more, a couple of\nother things that we need to tweak.\n\n490\n00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.102\nBut I'm just not real sure that\nwe have time in this episode.\n\n491\n00:26:29.102 --> 00:26:31.945\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe've got a full three minutes left, so\n\n492\n00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:35.440\nI'm sure that that could\ndefinitely get some stuff done.\n\n493\n00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.205\nOr is this a little beyond that scope?\n\n494\n00:26:37.205 --> 00:26:41.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know if three minutes is\nquite gonna do it, Daniel, I don't know.\n\n495\n00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.666\n&gt;&gt; Well, if we must, I guess we're looking\ndown the barrel of another part two.\n\n496\n00:26:44.666 --> 00:26:47.070\nBut heck, they're so much fun,\nlet's do it anyway, right.\n\n497\n00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.610\nThat's a good time had by all.\n\n498\n00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:53.104\nJustin, thanks so much for starting\nto get our feet wet inside of looking\n\n499\n00:26:53.104 --> 00:26:56.798\nat the Document Object Model,\nlike, the DOM, as it were.\n\n500\n00:26:56.798 --> 00:27:00.519\nWe're looking forward to part two and\nfinishing out that exposé.\n\n501\n00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:03.000\nThat being said,\nit looks like it is our time to sign off.\n\n502\n00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.950\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n503\n00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:07.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n504\n00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.340\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:07.831\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:08.677\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:12.270\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.020\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.080\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n9\n00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.280\nin today's episode we're continuing\non with our web development series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.910\nThat's the show I'm in today.\n\n11\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.304\nAnd of course joining me in the studio,\nyet again, is our good friend Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:28.120\nJustin Dennison.\n\n13\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.160\nJustin, welcome back sir.\n\n14\n00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.340\nHow goes it today?\n\n15\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.990\n&gt;&gt; It's going well.\n\n16\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.870\nThanks for having me back.\n\n17\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.600\nAnd how are you today?\n\n18\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.980\n&gt;&gt; I can't complain my man.\n\n19\n00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.690\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nI do like to hear that.\n\n20\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.710\nI do like to hear that.\n\n21\n00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.019\nSo we're actually gonna continue our\nscouring into the document object model.\n\n22\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.510\nIt's the set of JavaScript application\nprogramming interfaces or APIs\n\n23\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.680\nthat allow us to interact with the HTML\npage and do some pretty dynamic things.\n\n24\n00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.890\nBut we have to start with these\nfoundations before we actually see\n\n25\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.720\nthe power.\n\n26\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.010\nSo let's go ahead and hop back into our\nproject here and just do a quick review.\n\n27\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.270\nWe covered getElementById,\nget ElementsByTagName, querySelector and\n\n28\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.830\nquerySelectorAll.\n\n29\n00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.630\nThese two, definitely they provide\nthe same thing for the most part,\n\n30\n00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.210\nwe'll see a small difference.\n\n31\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.960\nAnd then getElementsByTagName and\n\n32\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.700\nquerySelectorAll with the p tag\nprovide also a similar experience.\n\n33\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.420\nSo let's just go take a look there.\n\n34\n00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.370\nAnd you can see that paragraphsAgain,\nI use querySelectorAll and I refresh.\n\n35\n00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.770\nIt is a node list.\n\n36\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.570\nNow that's a little different\nthan the HTML collection.\n\n37\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.500\nThey're similar but not quite.\n\n38\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.520\nSo we have these of grabbing the DOM.\n\n39\n00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.480\nThere is actually one other way,\n\n40\n00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.090\nif I wanted to say get things by classes,\nby CSS selector classes.\n\n41\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.870\nSo, let's hop over into our index.html and\njust make some, well,\n\n42\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.190\nI made a lot of paragraph tags in there,\njust for an example.\n\n43\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.720\nSo, let's make a div with the card\nclass and let's just make 10 of these,\n\n44\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.130\nlet's keep these a little more reasonable.\n\n45\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.140\nNow classes are great for\nCSS styling and things, but\n\n46\n00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.920\nthat's not what we're worried about.\n\n47\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.040\nWe wanna see how can we use this\nselection to grab just the divs or\n\n48\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.910\nany other element that has the class?\n\n49\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.440\nAnd I'll show you how the element\nultimately doesn't matter.\n\n50\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.540\nSo I'm gonna save,\nI'm not gonna put anything in those.\n\n51\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.150\nWe're just interacting with the DOM,\nI'm gonna call these cards,\n\n52\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.840\nbecause that is their descriptor.\n\n53\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.430\nThey would probably be styled something\nlike the little image cards that you\n\n54\n00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.610\nwould see with a header,\nand a title, and an image.\n\n55\n00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.930\nSo I'm gonna say const cards, and\n\n56\n00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.730\nthere's this document.getElements,\n\n57\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.500\nnotice there's an s there, and\nsince there is an s, that means\n\n58\n00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.540\nI have a multiple ones and\nthe class name is card.\n\n59\n00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.590\nSo, I'm gonna print out cards here,\nand here we go.\n\n60\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.650\nLet's go take a look there and\nI refresh and\n\n61\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.810\nnotice I have all things\nthat have the class of card.\n\n62\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.380\nNow, currently I have just\nthe div with classes of cards.\n\n63\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.490\nBut what happens if I change that to\ninstead, right down here below the last\n\n64\n00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.340\none, I add a section tag\nwhich is a new creation for\n\n65\n00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.040\nHTML and I give it the class of card,\nwell, is that also gonna select because\n\n66\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.829\notherwise some of the other ones they\nwouldn't provide me access to the section?\n\n67\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.050\nLet's go see if that changes and before\nI refresh, here's all of our div cards.\n\n68\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.271\nThey're stacked on top of each other.\n\n69\n00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:37.813\nThey don't have any content in them,\nso they're not doing anything special.\n\n70\n00:03:37.813 --> 00:03:42.054\nBut if I refresh, notice I have added,\n\n71\n00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:46.540\nthere's the section with\nthe class of cards.\n\n72\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.450\nSo if I wanna grab a group\nof things that have a class,\n\n73\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.300\nI can use getElementsByClassName.\n\n74\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.510\nNow notice getElementsByTagName,\nand getElementsByClassName,\n\n75\n00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.749\nthey both have an s in them, which means\nI'm getting a collection, an array-ish,\n\n76\n00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:03.430\nan array-like thing.\n\n77\n00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.000\nThey're not quite arrays but\nthey do have similar properties.\n\n78\n00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.290\nNow, that's not the only way to get\neverything with a specific class.\n\n79\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.250\nWell, if I use querySelectorAll,\n\n80\n00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.430\nquerySelector blah, I wonder if I\ncan leverage that to my advantage.\n\n81\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.560\nLet see cards again, and\nthat is document.querySelectorAll.\n\n82\n00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.360\nAnd I'm gonna use the CSS selector,\nwhich is a period.\n\n83\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.970\nSo if I want to select something with\na class, I put a period in front of it.\n\n84\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.580\nAgain, if you haven't, if you're like\nwhat is that CSS that he's talking about?\n\n85\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.440\nWe have some courses in our course library\nthat you should definitely go check out\n\n86\n00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.060\nto make yourself aware of HTML,\n\n87\n00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.510\nCSS, because there is an assumption that\nyou have a basic knowledge set there.\n\n88\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.750\nSo let's print out cardsAgain,\nthat is not how you spell again.\n\n89\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.590\nAnd I refresh and it looks very similar\n\n90\n00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.380\nexcept notice it is not an HTML\ncollection, it's again that node list.\n\n91\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.360\nSo there's a small difference there.\n\n92\n00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.070\nNow, I see the difference\nbetween querySelectorAll and\n\n93\n00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.610\ngetElementsByClassName.\n\n94\n00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.180\nI also see a difference for\ngetElementsByTagName and querySelectorAll\n\n95\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.090\nfor the p tags, but\nmaybe we kind of brushed over.\n\n96\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.240\nIt hit me, I should probably go back and\nmake sure these actually provide the exact\n\n97\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.810\nsame data structure or\ndata type based on these selections.\n\n98\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.576\nSo let's look at paraOne and\nwe're working backwards\n\n99\n00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:39.870\njust a little bit because\nwe wanna double check.\n\n100\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.680\nWe wanna make sure everything's just so.\n\n101\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.230\nOkay, these look the same but\nnotice I'm not getting details.\n\n102\n00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.580\nSo console.log is not gonna work for\nme here.\n\n103\n00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.950\nI actually need that console.dir to\npull all of those properties out.\n\n104\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.150\nAnd I'm gonna go refresh and\nnotice, all this looks the same.\n\n105\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.450\nIf I drop this down and\n\n106\n00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.990\nI come to the very bottom, lots of\nproperties on these it's sometimes scary.\n\n107\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.550\nThis is an HTMLParagraphElement.\n\n108\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.820\nAnd this is what's provided\nby the getElementByID.\n\n109\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.240\nIf I open up and look at the properties\nand the type of this one,\n\n110\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.250\nwhich is from querySelector, I come down\nhere and I get an HTMLParagraphElement.\n\n111\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.810\nSo those in fact do return similar things.\n\n112\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.990\nI will forewarn you, depending on the\ncontext, every once in a while you'll get\n\n113\n00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:34.140\nthis thing called a node here,\nwhich an HTML paragraph element is a node.\n\n114\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.540\nSo, an HTML paragraph element a specific\ntype of node, node would be more general.\n\n115\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:46.780\nSo, well, I don't know, I have all of\nthese oncuechange, oncut, child nodes.\n\n116\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.480\nWhat are those things?\n\n117\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.610\nBut if I look at the __ proto.\n\n118\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.060\nOkay, well, I have,\nthat comes from the HTMLParagraphElement.\n\n119\n00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.090\nAll right, if I scroll down,\nyou will notice that this has,\n\n120\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.780\ngot to scroll a great deal,\nan HTMLElement prototype.\n\n121\n00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.160\nSo the prototype has another prototype,\nright?\n\n122\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.980\nSo it's kinda like this cookie cutter was\nmade in resemblance to another cookie\n\n123\n00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.740\ncutter that if I look again,\nan HTML element which is more general.\n\n124\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.490\nI keep scrolling down.\n\n125\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.780\nNotice some of these properties repeat and\n\n126\n00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.434\nthat's through JavaScript\ninheritance structures.\n\n127\n00:07:26.434 --> 00:07:28.622\nIf I scroll down, did I go too far?\n\n128\n00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:32.030\nWait, no, I didn't.\nGotta keep scrolling,\n\n129\n00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.559\nkeep scrolling, keep scrolling.\n\n130\n00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.130\nAnd notice that I now have an element.\n\n131\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.160\nOkay, well,\nthat's more general than an HTML element.\n\n132\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.740\nAn HTML element is more general\nthan a paragraph HTML element.\n\n133\n00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.539\nWe gotta find to the very end of this,\n\n134\n00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:51.464\nand I do have some impetus for\nthis, so bear with me.\n\n135\n00:07:51.464 --> 00:07:53.383\nAnd all of these properties,\n\n136\n00:07:53.383 --> 00:07:58.530\neverything that is available here would\nbe available on that paragraph element\n\n137\n00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.544\nthat you have accessed programmatically\nthrough paraOne or paraOneAgain.\n\n138\n00:08:03.544 --> 00:08:06.050\nI keep scrolling,\nkeep scrolling, there's node.\n\n139\n00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:12.784\nSo an HTML paragraph\nelement is an HTML element.\n\n140\n00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:17.749\nAn HTML element is an element,\nan element is a node.\n\n141\n00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:18.642\nWhat about a node?\n\n142\n00:08:18.642 --> 00:08:20.230\nWhat is a node?\n\n143\n00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.995\nWell, a node is an event target.\n\n144\n00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:25.792\nWe haven't talked about events yet,\nwe'll get to those.\n\n145\n00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:30.640\nAnd then if I look again,\nan event target is an object.\n\n146\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.100\nI've now traced this back.\n\n147\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.200\nThese are just technically JavaScript\nobjects that I can interact with, and\n\n148\n00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.180\nthat's where the idea of\nthe document object model comes in.\n\n149\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.530\nI now have a specific instantiation,\na specific kind of interface,\n\n150\n00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.150\nfor the HTML through JavaScript.\n\n151\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.491\n&gt;&gt; So, Justin,\nis the purpose of them naming them, or\n\n152\n00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:55.061\ngetting more specific with the naming\nconvention, basically to let you know,\n\n153\n00:08:55.061 --> 00:08:57.533\nthis is an object but\nthis is a specific type of object?\n\n154\n00:08:57.533 --> 00:09:02.761\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, because depending on\nparagraph, div, anchor tag, link tag, all\n\n155\n00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:08.248\nof those image tags, all of those may have\na little bit different variation, right?\n\n156\n00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:10.049\nBut they are all objects and\n\n157\n00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:13.970\nthey're node in this HTML\nstructure if we take a look here.\n\n158\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.380\nThese are considered nodes,\nit's kind of like a tree structure.\n\n159\n00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:25.450\nIt starts with the body, and kinda fans\nout as leaves of the tree, or branches.\n\n160\n00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:30.840\nSo those are nodes, and then each one of\nthose nodes is technically an element.\n\n161\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.840\nAnd each one of those is an HTML element.\n\n162\n00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.710\nBut then when we start to get to\nspecifics, a paragraph has a different set\n\n163\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.550\nof minor property differences and\nminor behavior differences from an H1 tag.\n\n164\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.590\nMaybe it's just styling, actually\na lot of times it's just styling, but\n\n165\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.140\nthat's not always the case, right?\n\n166\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.390\nImage tags are going to display images\nwithin them, they don't have any text.\n\n167\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.094\nSo they have additional properties that\ndo not make sense in the context of\n\n168\n00:09:58.094 --> 00:09:59.120\nthe paragraph tag.\n\n169\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.858\nSo we add that specificity, but for\nthe most part, if it's available\n\n170\n00:10:03.858 --> 00:10:08.549\nanywhere in this hierarchy before\nyou get to the specifics, right?\n\n171\n00:10:08.549 --> 00:10:10.080\nAn H1 versus a paragraph.\n\n172\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.620\nThey're all, let me get back, whew.\n\n173\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.171\n&gt;&gt; Wait for it.\n\n174\n00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:17.092\n&gt;&gt; Wait for it, it's a buildup,\nit's a buildup.\n\n175\n00:10:19.072 --> 00:10:19.957\nWe're still waiting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n176\n00:10:19.957 --> 00:10:23.305\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They are all technically HTML elements,\n\n177\n00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:27.611\nso anything from here down would\nbe available in paragraphs and\n\n178\n00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:29.750\nin H1s and in image tags.\n\n179\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.990\nBut then when we start to\nget a little more specific,\n\n180\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.950\nparticularly an HTML paragraph element.\n\n181\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.470\nThose are specific to\nthe paragraph element types.\n\n182\n00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.390\nSo then that's where we start to get\nthat specificity that specialization and\n\n183\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.337\nhow I can interact with these.\n\n184\n00:10:46.337 --> 00:10:48.756\nSo I can grab things out of the DOM,\nright?\n\n185\n00:10:48.756 --> 00:10:50.793\nI can manipulate them,\nI can assign them the variables.\n\n186\n00:10:50.793 --> 00:10:55.317\nAnd we'll see here just shortly\nhow I can I can actually change\n\n187\n00:10:55.317 --> 00:10:58.371\nthings on the fly and do some weird stuff.\n\n188\n00:10:58.371 --> 00:11:03.820\nJust to remind ourselves in anticipation\nof building web applications.\n\n189\n00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.570\nBut there's also programmatic\nways to create a new element.\n\n190\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.280\nSo I can create this with JavaScript and\njust put it in the page.\n\n191\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.070\n&gt;&gt; So we don't like what we see, I'm like,\neh, I'm gonna make it my own way.\n\n192\n00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.400\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I can make it my own way.\n\n193\n00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.790\nAll I need is the body tag, and\n\n194\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.010\nthen everything else can be\ngenerated from JavaScript.\n\n195\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.900\nI don't have to write\nany of the other markup,\n\n196\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.650\nwhich is handy because sometimes our\nweb applications are data driven.\n\n197\n00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.371\nThey're not static files,\nthat I can say I want this image here, and\n\n198\n00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:34.180\nit's gonna be this exact image.\n\n199\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.080\nYou'll grab a database call,\nyou'll web scrape through some news feeds.\n\n200\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.610\nAnd because that content changes,\n\n201\n00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.740\nyou can't have static files\nthat are just standard markup.\n\n202\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.490\nI need some way to\ndynamically generate that\n\n203\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.960\nbased on the data that is provided to me.\n\n204\n00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.580\nSo, what do I do?\n\n205\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.830\nI let JavaScript do the hard work.\n\n206\n00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:00.680\nNow this is if you've ever heard I wanna\nsay some words of Angular, React, View.\n\n207\n00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.890\nAny of these JavaScript front-end\nframeworks which we will get to\n\n208\n00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.650\nat a later time.\n\n209\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.890\nThey are doing something very similar.\n\n210\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:14.350\nThey are creating these elements in\nHTML through the use of JavaScript.\n\n211\n00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.410\nWell, we've seen how to grab them.\n\n212\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.440\nLet's actually take a look\nat how to create them.\n\n213\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.310\nAnd for now,\nI'm going to just comment these out here.\n\n214\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.820\nMan, that was a lot of markup.\n\n215\n00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.740\nSo, this is commented out.\n\n216\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.048\nThat is an HTML comment.\n\n217\n00:12:32.048 --> 00:12:35.504\nI actually want to create\nnew elements on the page.\n\n218\n00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:37.680\nI'm gonna comment this out.\n\n219\n00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.000\nWe're starting more or less afresh.\n\n220\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.210\nSo I'm gonna add some end here,\njust so we can\n\n221\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.030\nget some appropriate scroll and\nhere we go.\n\n222\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.238\nSo let's actually make a dynamic button,\nright?\n\n223\n00:12:55.238 --> 00:13:00.035\nI wanna make a button tag because I\nknow it immediately is going to come\n\n224\n00:13:00.035 --> 00:13:01.400\nonto the page.\n\n225\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.649\nSo I'm gonna say this is a button.\n\n226\n00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:08.243\nAnd on the document object,\nI have a create element.\n\n227\n00:13:08.243 --> 00:13:10.256\nSo I have a get and a query selector.\n\n228\n00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:15.190\nI can go find them but I have the ability\nto create them with JavaScript.\n\n229\n00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.220\nAnd within that,\nit is typically looking for a tag name.\n\n230\n00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.350\nIt is not looking for markup using\nthe less than greater than sign or\n\n231\n00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.660\nthere's a special name for those.\n\n232\n00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.800\nIt eludes me at current time.\n\n233\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.753\nBut I'm just gonna say it's a button.\n\n234\n00:13:29.753 --> 00:13:32.306\nOkay, let's just console.log.\n\n235\n00:13:32.306 --> 00:13:37.093\nAnd see what that is and then we'll see\nhow are we gonna put that in the page?\n\n236\n00:13:37.093 --> 00:13:40.377\nHow are we gonna see that on page load?\n\n237\n00:13:40.377 --> 00:13:43.353\nSo there's my button and there it is.\n\n238\n00:13:43.353 --> 00:13:45.091\nI have now made a new HTML element.\n\n239\n00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:48.580\nI haven't written any HTML.\n\n240\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.840\nI've written JavaScript.\n\n241\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.560\nJavaScript's handling that overhead for\nme.\n\n242\n00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.940\nWell, it's not real interesting right now.\n\n243\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.850\nThere's no text in it.\n\n244\n00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.460\nIt doesn't do anything.\n\n245\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.500\nSo we should probably fix that.\n\n246\n00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.550\nWell, let's actually figure\nout how to put it on the body.\n\n247\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.140\nLet's put it in our HTML.\n\n248\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.560\nAnd to show you that it's not getting\nput on the body, I'm gonna refresh.\n\n249\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.950\nGo to the elements inspector and\nnotice there's no button listed here.\n\n250\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.480\nI'm not going, look at this hand,\nwhile I'm doing something over here.\n\n251\n00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.550\nI'm trying to be transparent.\n\n252\n00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:25.153\nSo we can say, document, and\nthe body is a particular part of\n\n253\n00:14:25.153 --> 00:14:29.966\nthe document, it's special so\nit has its own selection.\n\n254\n00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:34.594\nAnd I can say append(button).\n\n255\n00:14:34.594 --> 00:14:37.670\nAnd if I refresh, if you look over here,\n\n256\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.850\nnotice I now have a button,\nit has no text in it.\n\n257\n00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:48.490\nAnd if I go look at the HTML, well, I\ndon't see this in the static markup, do I?\n\n258\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.368\nLet's go look.\n\n259\n00:14:49.368 --> 00:14:51.084\n[NOISE] You know what, I don't see it.\n\n260\n00:14:51.084 --> 00:14:54.680\nAha, it's right down there.\n\n261\n00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.240\nIt's actually at the very end.\n\n262\n00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.670\nSo when I append something,\nthat's coming in at the very last moment.\n\n263\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.140\nAnd it is right here.\n\n264\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.356\nNow I used a trick here, document.body.\n\n265\n00:15:06.356 --> 00:15:08.160\nHow would I ever know that?\n\n266\n00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.300\nYou just taught me how to get things out\nof the DOM using all these other ways.\n\n267\n00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.533\nWell, you can use those other ways,\nand to prove it to you.\n\n268\n00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:15.540\nI'm gonna do just that.\n\n269\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:22.300\nSo the body is document.get,\nlet's actually just say querySelector.\n\n270\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.830\nI'm a big fan of the querySelector.\n\n271\n00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:31.309\nAnd I'm gonna look at body, and\nI'm gonna say body.append(button).\n\n272\n00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.986\nAnd it's still there, there it is.\n\n273\n00:15:34.986 --> 00:15:38.250\nBut you're like, well,\nthat's cool that I can create elements but\n\n274\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.610\nthere's nothing in there.\n\n275\n00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.122\nIt's just a button,\nno text, it doesn't click.\n\n276\n00:15:43.122 --> 00:15:45.250\nWell, we haven't learned\nhow to make them click.\n\n277\n00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.472\nThat's the weird thing about HTML.\n\n278\n00:15:47.472 --> 00:15:50.572\nUntil you tell them that they\nshould do something on click or\n\n279\n00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:52.270\non hover, they don't.\n\n280\n00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.720\nThey're just static little widgets.\n\n281\n00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.371\nSo how do I put some text in there?\n\n282\n00:15:59.371 --> 00:16:01.306\nSo there's several\ndifferent properties and\n\n283\n00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:04.980\nI wanted to highlight these because\nthis is a point of contention.\n\n284\n00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.005\nI was like, wow, that's weird.\n\n285\n00:16:06.005 --> 00:16:08.116\nI remember doing this and thinking,\n\n286\n00:16:08.116 --> 00:16:11.780\nwhy would you have all these\nways to do the same thing?\n\n287\n00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.300\nWell, let's see.\n\n288\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:21.250\nSo if I say button.innerHTML equals,\nand let's just say, click, right.\n\n289\n00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:29.260\nSo I'm grabbing a property of\na button Object called innerHTML and\n\n290\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.610\nthat means, the thing between open and\nclosed tags if I come back here and\n\n291\n00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:38.530\nlook the innerHTML is everything\nbetween the tags the open and close.\n\n292\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.490\nNow some HTML tags that\ndoesn't make any sense so\n\n293\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.610\nyou have to be careful you can't\nunderscore innerHTML and everything,\n\n294\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.000\nlike image tags don't have an open and\nclose, they're just a single piece.\n\n295\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:55.710\nSo, if I look at this, this should, notice\nthere's a key word there, sometimes things\n\n296\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:01.500\ngo awry, this should give me a button\nwith the word click in it, and it does.\n\n297\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.720\nNow, should I use innerHTML?\n\n298\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.470\nWell, I'm gonna put a little comment here,\nsecurity problem.\n\n299\n00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.970\nSo this will actually render any HTML.\n\n300\n00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.580\nSo if you're taking user input and\n\n301\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.530\nyou're assigning it to enter\nHTML then it will execute.\n\n302\n00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.520\nSo people can inject executable code\ninto your html, and if they can find\n\n303\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.420\na way to make that persist, they can send\nit to somebody, and now you are open to\n\n304\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.760\nwhat's called a Cross-Site Scripting\nattack, and that's bad.\n\n305\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.660\nWe wanna make sure our staff is secure,\nso, I recommend against this.\n\n306\n00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:42.140\nIn addition to inner htmls kind of being\naround, it's not the fastest to update.\n\n307\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.250\nIf I had five million elements,\n\n308\n00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.170\nwhich was a giant HTML page,\nlet's go to the extreme.\n\n309\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.150\nGo big or go home, right?\n\n310\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.110\nIf I had five million elements,\nand on button click,\n\n311\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.440\nI wanted to update what's inside all\nof these elements, it's just text.\n\n312\n00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.450\nThen using inner HTML is\nactually going to start to lag.\n\n313\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.480\nAnd for instance I read,\ndon't quote me this.\n\n314\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:11.350\nBut its somewhere around 200 milliseconds\n\n315\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:17.370\nto update html of\na particular dom object well,\n\n316\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:23.710\nthat means you're gonna\nstart getting some lag.\n\n317\n00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.760\nYour update's not gonna be\nable to keep up with your data\n\n318\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.670\nbeing pumped into your application.\n\n319\n00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.830\nSo, all right, and it's a security risk.\n\n320\n00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.130\nMaybe we shouldn't use innerHTML,\n\n321\n00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:39.000\nnow I say that just as\na personal recommendation.\n\n322\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.850\nI still use this from time to time,\nespecially if I know\n\n323\n00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.190\nthat I'm not taking user input but\nI want it to render as HTML.\n\n324\n00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.650\nLike it's a dynamic object that's going,\nthere's an image,\n\n325\n00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.240\nlike I'm turning the button to have an\nimage inside of it based on interaction.\n\n326\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.160\nThat's still a decent use case but\njust keep in mind those are things that\n\n327\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.470\nyou gotta have context for\nwhy you're doing something.\n\n328\n00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.600\nSo let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n329\n00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.570\nWhat are the other ways?\n\n330\n00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:08.770\nWell, there's this other one,\nbutton.textContent.\n\n331\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.720\nExcuse me, I wanna start here.\n\n332\n00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:17.170\nI'm getting ahead of myself, and that\nis not how you spell click, or clickle.\n\n333\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.710\nSo if I refresh,\nit'll look exactly the same.\n\n334\n00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:21.640\nNow, what is the difference?\n\n335\n00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.830\nWell, if you're taking user input, and\n\n336\n00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.650\nyou modified the inner text,\nit does an escape sequence.\n\n337\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.706\nIt will not render anything\nthat is misinterpreted as HTML.\n\n338\n00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:36.280\nSo, I don't have to worry about\ncross site scripting attacks.\n\n339\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.220\nWell that's right, we're doing better,\nbut it is still sometimes slow.\n\n340\n00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:45.980\nIt has roughly the same update speed,\nor the render speed, as enter HTML.\n\n341\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.370\nSo, in context, it can be slow.\n\n342\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.190\nOkay, well, what's a better way?\n\n343\n00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.530\nI'm glad you're keeping up,\nyou're asking questions, I like that.\n\n344\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:02.926\nSo there's an additional\none called textContent.\n\n345\n00:20:05.757 --> 00:20:09.450\nAnd if we refresh it is\nthe exact same thing.\n\n346\n00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.990\nNow you may be asking yourself,\nyou just told us three ways\n\n347\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.400\nto update the text inside of\na button programmatically.\n\n348\n00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.340\nWhy would there ever be three\nways to do something like this?\n\n349\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.090\n&gt;&gt; To confuse us, of course.\n\n350\n00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.255\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, Daniel.\n\n351\n00:20:24.255 --> 00:20:27.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, I wanna guard my job, so\n\n352\n00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.556\nif I can make it difficult for you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n353\n00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:30.160\n&gt;&gt; Then I'm\n\n354\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.620\nthe only one who knows the magical\nincantations that should occur.\n\n355\n00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:40.200\nIn all reality, what has happened is\nthese things have changed over the years.\n\n356\n00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.010\nBut you can't get rid of the old way,\n\n357\n00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.650\nbecause that breaks other\npeople's applications.\n\n358\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.760\nSo you just we're gonna add this, and\n\n359\n00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.340\nthis is gonna stay here or it came from\na different browser implementation.\n\n360\n00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.450\nThe IE series was notorious for\nimplementing it their way.\n\n361\n00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.400\n&gt;&gt; Security aside you would think,\nand what I mean is,\n\n362\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.830\nwe're gonna take an aside here to\ntalk about security for a second.\n\n363\n00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.670\nYou would think that they would\nwant to do that to force people\n\n364\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.030\nto update your browser.\n\n365\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.289\nNewer browsers are more secure,\nget rid of the old, let's stay on the new.\n\n366\n00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:14.607\nAnd I understand people build\ntheir own in-house systems and\n\n367\n00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:19.040\nthings of that nature, you got\na programming team, they're creating apps.\n\n368\n00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.240\nWeb apps, you name it, it's happening.\n\n369\n00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.830\nThey need to stay on\nthe bleeding edge as well.\n\n370\n00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.980\nMaybe not the bleeding edge but\nat least the cutting edge, right?\n\n371\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.090\nYou need to not be back on IE 8 right now.\n\n372\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.380\nAnd that is happening,\nthat is something that is still occurring.\n\n373\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.800\nPeople are still running XP and\nthings of that nature.\n\n374\n00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.710\nOld Java, it's still happening.\n\n375\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.424\nWe need to kind of,\n\n376\n00:21:36.424 --> 00:21:38.849\nyou would think they would be\ntrying to force them a little more.\n\n377\n00:21:38.849 --> 00:21:41.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know the thought process.\n\n378\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.180\nI think to make sure that\nthe language stays pervasive and\n\n379\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.060\nis still used a great deal,\nthey wanna support those old browsers.\n\n380\n00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.690\nNow, they do take things\nout from time to time.\n\n381\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.870\nLike the notorious blink tag.\n\n382\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.418\nIf you ever built a geocities webpage,\nI had blink tags on blink tags.\n\n383\n00:21:57.418 --> 00:21:59.840\n&gt;&gt; And all they would do would blink,\njust blink.\n\n384\n00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.220\nAnd there's actually a wonderful blog\npost about the guy who made that, and\n\n385\n00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.324\nhe was like, I'm sorry,\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n386\n00:22:07.324 --> 00:22:10.740\nNow you should stay updated,\nI would be careful,\n\n387\n00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.150\nunless you have a particular client\nrequest, I wouldnt target older browsers.\n\n388\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.950\nBecause there are valid security concerns.\n\n389\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:24.140\nYou should keep things updated,\ntry to keep on the front end of this, but\n\n390\n00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.460\nit is incredibly difficult because\nI just showed you three ways\n\n391\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.010\nto update text inside of an element.\n\n392\n00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:30.840\n&gt;&gt; And they weren't very difficult.\n\n393\n00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.760\n&gt;&gt; And they weren't very difficult,\nbut there's actually a fourth way.\n\n394\n00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.790\nSo, I'm gonna show you the fourth way and\nthis is not the only thing you can do,\n\n395\n00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.610\nthis is one of those things that people\nwanna do this cuz it's kinda cool,\n\n396\n00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.920\nyou can see immediate changes, right?\n\n397\n00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.510\nText change and so, I wanted to illustrate\nthat there are multiple ways and\n\n398\n00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:51.900\nyou may feel frustrated when you're like,\nthere's nine ways to do this and\n\n399\n00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.960\nthat's okay, that's part of programming.\n\n400\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.600\nMy main concern when I first\nbuild something is does it work?\n\n401\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.380\nIf it works then I'm good.\n\n402\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:04.210\nThen I'll go back and figure should\nI use innerHTML in a text fountain\n\n403\n00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.000\nthis other way I'm gonna show you.\n\n404\n00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.870\nWhat are the pros and cons right?\n\n405\n00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.250\n&gt;&gt; That's a good point\nit's really easy to go for\n\n406\n00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.610\nthat instant gratification\n&gt;&gt; Of I'm gonna look through this and\n\n407\n00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.620\nfigure out the exact right way to.\n\n408\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.550\nLike you said,\njust get the thing working and\n\n409\n00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.570\nthen you'll work on streamlining it later.\n\n410\n00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:21.330\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n411\n00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.490\nOptimization comes afterwards,\nif it doesn't work and\n\n412\n00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.560\nyou're optimizing something\nthat doesn't work.\n\n413\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.380\nWow, you have a really\nwell-running broken thing.\n\n414\n00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n415\n00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Well\n&gt;&gt; I always try to optimizer this toaster,\n\n416\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.080\ndoes it make toast?\n\n417\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.792\nNo.\nWell it's not a toaster, so\n\n418\n00:23:35.792 --> 00:23:40.379\nkeep in mind get things working, come back\nand reflect about your code that will\n\n419\n00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:45.308\nactually make you a better programmer than\njust going, I'm gonna spend the next four\n\n420\n00:23:45.308 --> 00:23:50.118\ndays reading about the differences between\ninner text, inner html text content.\n\n421\n00:23:50.118 --> 00:23:53.438\nAnd I've been promising in this forced\nway, I should probably go ahead and\n\n422\n00:23:53.438 --> 00:23:56.350\nshow you that [INAUDIBLE], so\nlet's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n423\n00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:57.256\nWhat is that fourth way?\n\n424\n00:23:57.256 --> 00:24:00.918\nWell, behind the scenes when you do this,\n\n425\n00:24:00.918 --> 00:24:05.920\nJavaScript is doing some Some\nhandwaving machinations.\n\n426\n00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.400\nIt's actually creating something\ncalled a text node, and\n\n427\n00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.880\nthat is a special little piece\nthat fits inside of these.\n\n428\n00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.670\nBecause text is special, it has to fit\nwithin the HTML kind of hierarchy.\n\n429\n00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.566\nSo if I wanted something called\nbutton text, and I could say hey,\n\n430\n00:24:24.566 --> 00:24:30.832\ndocument.createTextNode, is that right?\n\n431\n00:24:30.832 --> 00:24:32.420\nI have to double check.\n\n432\n00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.080\nWe might be debugging\nit a little bit here.\n\n433\n00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.840\nAnd let's just say ('Click').\n\n434\n00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:44.187\nAnd then I can say\nbutton.append(buttonText).\n\n435\n00:24:45.608 --> 00:24:46.506\nRefresh.\n\n436\n00:24:46.506 --> 00:24:49.233\nHaha, I got lucky Daniel, I got lucky.\n\n437\n00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:51.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it is exactly the same thing.\n\n438\n00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.450\nWhat is this TextNode thing?\n\n439\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.559\nWell let's do a little\nbit of inspection here.\n\n440\n00:24:58.674 --> 00:25:00.040\nAnd there we are.\n\n441\n00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.850\nRefresh.\n\n442\n00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:05.220\nLet's go over the console and\nnotice it's just text.\n\n443\n00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.000\nBut notice it's purple.\n\n444\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.250\nHm, that hints to me\nthis might be special.\n\n445\n00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.970\nSo instead of log I'm gonna console.dir.\n\n446\n00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.120\nI'm gonna try to pull that apart if I can.\n\n447\n00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.750\nI refresh and notice it says text.\n\n448\n00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.960\nAnd if I scroll down to\nthe type it is a type text.\n\n449\n00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:29.350\nIf I look at the prototype or\nthe cookie cutter, it is a character data.\n\n450\n00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.410\nWell, that's weird.\n\n451\n00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:31.220\nWhat is character data?\n\n452\n00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.480\nI don't know.\n\n453\n00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.760\nBut, I'm gonna go find,\nthere's that node thing.\n\n454\n00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.150\nWe've seen that node.\n\n455\n00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.620\nEverything on the page has\nto be a document node.\n\n456\n00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:46.100\nSo, you can think of a node as, where two\nbranches, kinda, split apart on a tree,\n\n457\n00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:51.140\nthe part where they split apart is a node\nand that's what your document looks like.\n\n458\n00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.090\nIf you squint your eyes,\n\n459\n00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:56.180\nturn your head sideways and try real hard,\nyou can make it turn into that.\n\n460\n00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.190\nSo this has to be a node.\n\n461\n00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:02.210\nWell, why did the other ways work if\nthis is actually what's happening?\n\n462\n00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:07.660\nBehind the scenes textContent, innerText\nand innerHTML are doing these two steps.\n\n463\n00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.120\nThey're creating a text node and\ninserting it in there for you.\n\n464\n00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.310\n&gt;&gt; So they just create shortcut ways to do\nthis that becomes standards of the system.\n\n465\n00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n466\n00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:21.790\nNow, what I like about the TextNode is\nmaybe that's all I need to change, right?\n\n467\n00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.900\nMaybe I just need to change\nthe actual text property, or\n\n468\n00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.770\nI just need to generate those and\neverything else can stay the same.\n\n469\n00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:32.070\nSo I have a little more flexibility, a\nlittle more control if I do the two steps.\n\n470\n00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:35.010\nBut, when in doubt,\nI would stay with this textContent,\n\n471\n00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.950\nbecause its update is on the order\nof I think about ten milliseconds.\n\n472\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.530\nDon't quote me on that, but,\n\n473\n00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:47.500\nin my reading, that is about a factor\nof ten faster than the other two.\n\n474\n00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.020\nNow there may be exceptions to the rules,\n\n475\n00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.940\njust to let you know that is\nnot by the definitive answer.\n\n476\n00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.690\nBut that is the best answer that I've\nbeen able to discern kind of diving in.\n\n477\n00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:05.630\nSo we have these HTML elements, we have\nthese document object model objects right?\n\n478\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:06.400\nI can grab them,\n\n479\n00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.960\nI can create them, but why would you\nreally use them, what is the purpose?\n\n480\n00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.910\nAnd I think it's best to see a couple\nof use cases, these are contrived,\n\n481\n00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:17.310\nbut they give you an idea of\nthings that are possible,\n\n482\n00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.110\nuntil we learn a little more like,\nhow do I make that button actually click?\n\n483\n00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.039\nLike, when I click it,\nI need it to do something.\n\n484\n00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.820\nSo let's do this.\n\n485\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.670\nI'm gonna add a little\nbit of markup over here.\n\n486\n00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.903\nAnd let's say, button.\n\n487\n00:27:33.903 --> 00:27:38.214\nAnd I'm gonna give it an id of clicky.\n\n488\n00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.980\nAnd it is clicky.\n\n489\n00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.290\nAnd then I'm gonna add another couple of\n\n490\n00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:51.690\nparagraphs that have the class of things.\n\n491\n00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.110\nI'm just gonna give those of three.\n\n492\n00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:58.250\nThis is real technical testing here.\n\n493\n00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.930\nNotice those words,\nthose are encoded words.\n\n494\n00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.660\nI'm joking,\ndon't try to break that cipher.\n\n495\n00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.169\nIt's just me leaning on the keyboard.\n\n496\n00:28:05.169 --> 00:28:07.904\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then finally,\n\n497\n00:28:07.904 --> 00:28:12.610\nI'm going to create just a bunch of divs.\n\n498\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.570\nSo, let's say ten, and there we go, okay?\n\n499\n00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.860\nSo there's my three\nkind of sets of markup.\n\n500\n00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.460\nLet's start by grabbing collections,\nor references to these.\n\n501\n00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.780\nI really have to figure\nout how to keep it from\n\n502\n00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.810\ndoing that comment on the next\nline every time I hit Enter.\n\n503\n00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.546\nSo I'm gonna get the clicky button, and\n\n504\n00:28:36.546 --> 00:28:40.740\nthat is document.querySelector,\nso I'm using that.\n\n505\n00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:46.269\nAnd it does have an id of clicky,\nso I'm gonna use #clicky.\n\n506\n00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:51.282\nI'm also going to grab,\nI'm just gonna call these paragraphs.\n\n507\n00:28:54.307 --> 00:28:57.610\nAnd I'm gonna grab those by the class.\n\n508\n00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.760\nEven though there's currently only\nthese paragraphs on the page,\n\n509\n00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.600\nif that ever changes and I'm not using\nthe class then I may accidentally select\n\n510\n00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.960\nother things I don't want to.\n\n511\n00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.880\nSo I'm gonna say has the class of things.\n\n512\n00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.531\nAnd then finally I'm going\nto grab the divs using\n\n513\n00:29:16.531 --> 00:29:20.882\ndocument.querySelectorAll ('div').\n\n514\n00:29:20.882 --> 00:29:23.430\nAll right, so I've used the three\nthings that we've reviewed.\n\n515\n00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:24.289\nNow what can I do?\n\n516\n00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:28.018\nJust to show you, there they are, boom.\n\n517\n00:29:28.018 --> 00:29:31.172\nLet's add a little bit to the divs just so\nwe can see here.\n\n518\n00:29:31.172 --> 00:29:36.151\nSo a, b,\n\n519\n00:29:36.151 --> 00:29:39.888\nc, d.\n\n520\n00:29:39.888 --> 00:29:42.162\nLet's just get rid of some of these divs.\n\n521\n00:29:42.162 --> 00:29:44.685\nI got a little ambitious there,\nI got a little ambitious.\n\n522\n00:29:44.685 --> 00:29:45.283\n&gt;&gt; Over zealous [LAUGH].\n\n523\n00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.699\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was like yeah watch this.\n\n524\n00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.200\nI gotta type stuff in there.\n\n525\n00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.840\nYeah, let's scale that back.\n\n526\n00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.846\nSo, if I refresh, notice it's [SOUND].\n\n527\n00:29:55.846 --> 00:29:58.260\nSo what would be nice to do?\n\n528\n00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.330\nWell, on page load,\nthis is gonna happen immediately,\n\n529\n00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.640\nI wanna change clicky's font color, right?\n\n530\n00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.030\nInstead of it being black,\nI wanna change it to chartreuse green.\n\n531\n00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:11.660\n&gt;&gt; Your favorite.\n\n532\n00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.440\n&gt;&gt; My favorite.\n\n533\n00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.430\nSo I'm gonna say clicky.\n\n534\n00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.410\nAnd we've already seen it's\njust a regular button.\n\n535\n00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.858\nAnd then I can access the style\nproperties through the .style.\n\n536\n00:30:21.858 --> 00:30:24.040\nAnd then I can say color.\n\n537\n00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.240\nAnd it's really weird.\n\n538\n00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.740\nThis is one of the font styles, selections\nthat doesn't start with the word font,\n\n539\n00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.240\nand I'm going to say chartreuse.\n\n540\n00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.840\nLets take a look here, aha,\nI now have chartreuse green clicky button.\n\n541\n00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.899\nWhat about the background color?\n\n542\n00:30:41.899 --> 00:30:47.940\nWell sometimes, I just like to try things.\n\n543\n00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.760\nLet's make this salmon.\n\n544\n00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.110\nThis is a well asked for design.\n\n545\n00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.750\nThis is probably one of\nthe best color pallets.\n\n546\n00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:55.600\n&gt;&gt; You see this everywhere.\n\n547\n00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n548\n00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:00.270\nAnd now I have a salmon button\nwith a chartreuse green text.\n\n549\n00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:06.340\nJust so we're clear, I probably wouldn't\ndo this in a real web application, but\n\n550\n00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.410\nit does illustrate the point.\n\n551\n00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.660\nNotice on page load it\nimmediately changes.\n\n552\n00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.190\nI can refresh all I want, right?\n\n553\n00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:18.030\nUntil I get rid of these lines it\nwill always be that on page refresh.\n\n554\n00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:18.930\nOkay, well, that's nice.\n\n555\n00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.200\nIt would be really nice if\nthat would happen on click.\n\n556\n00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.040\nWe'll get to that, so just bear with me.\n\n557\n00:31:25.098 --> 00:31:28.900\nSo clicky,\nwell clicky is a single element, so\n\n558\n00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.010\nI can access these properties as so.\n\n559\n00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:36.280\nThese other ones, though, they are\nactually collections or node lists, and\n\n560\n00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.770\nI can't easily change all of those\nwith just a single selection.\n\n561\n00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.674\nSo I'm actually going to run through and\n\n562\n00:31:44.674 --> 00:31:49.516\nchange all the paragraphs to the number\none font available, comic sans.\n\n563\n00:31:49.516 --> 00:31:52.850\nIt is one of the most professional fonts\nthat you can grab ahold of, Daniel.\n\n564\n00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:53.973\n&gt;&gt; It's what Microsoft uses I think.\n\n565\n00:31:53.973 --> 00:31:56.879\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ndon't use comic sans a great deal,\n\n566\n00:31:56.879 --> 00:32:00.119\nthat's I have to temper\nmy sarcasm sometimes.\n\n567\n00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:03.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there's actually a forEach method.\n\n568\n00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.210\nNow, how would I know that?\n\n569\n00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:08.970\nI could actually go inspect the NodeList\nprototype and see that there's a forEach.\n\n570\n00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:13.590\nAnd what that means is for each paragraph,\nI'm going to do something.\n\n571\n00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:17.545\nNow I'm using some of these new ES6\nfeatures because I like them, and\n\n572\n00:32:17.545 --> 00:32:18.896\nthey make me feel good.\n\n573\n00:32:18.896 --> 00:32:20.950\nSo I'm using a fat arrow function.\n\n574\n00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:24.030\nAnd for each paragraph,\nwhat do I want to do?\n\n575\n00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:33.328\nI want to paragraph.style.fontFamily\n= 'Comic Sans MS';.\n\n576\n00:32:33.328 --> 00:32:38.200\nNow, with fonts, if you don't spell\nthem just right, they won't work.\n\n577\n00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.016\nSo this might not work.\n\n578\n00:32:40.016 --> 00:32:43.010\nBut you'll notice I have\nnow changed the font.\n\n579\n00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.970\nUpon refresh,\nthat is always going to change.\n\n580\n00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.450\nBut notice, because these are classes,\n\n581\n00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:53.440\nI now have the ability to only affect\nthis portion of my web application.\n\n582\n00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.260\nClicky is not Comic Sans and\nneither are the divs below it.\n\n583\n00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.380\nSo that's important.\n\n584\n00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:05.920\nNow, I've selected based on tags,\nand I've selected based on classes.\n\n585\n00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.625\nBelieve it or not, if I know how to\ndo one, I know how to do the other,\n\n586\n00:33:09.625 --> 00:33:11.185\nif I use querySelectorAll.\n\n587\n00:33:11.185 --> 00:33:15.816\nquerySelectorAll to select multiple\nthings allows you to reduce the amount of\n\n588\n00:33:15.816 --> 00:33:18.680\nthings that I have to remember.\n\n589\n00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.830\nSo instead of getting by class name or tag\nname, I tend to go with querySelectorAll.\n\n590\n00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.610\nSo let's look at these divs,\nwhat do I wanna do with these divs?\n\n591\n00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:28.760\nWell, I wanna change the background color,\nthe width, and the height.\n\n592\n00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.280\nNow, this is a little,\ngotta be a little careful here.\n\n593\n00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.750\nSo I'm gonna say divs, and\nfor each of those divs,\n\n594\n00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:42.234\nI'm going to say\ndiv.style.backgroundColor.\n\n595\n00:33:42.234 --> 00:33:45.010\nDaniel, what's a good color?\n\n596\n00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.390\n&gt;&gt; A good color is a navy blue.\n\n597\n00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm just gonna say blue,\n\n598\n00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.675\ncuz I'm not sure navy blue is\npart of the CSS selection.\n\n599\n00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:53.545\nI just wanna see it work.\n\n600\n00:33:53.545 --> 00:33:56.189\nAnd then I wanna say\n\n601\n00:33:56.189 --> 00:34:01.153\ndiv.style.width equals-\n&gt;&gt; Yellow.\n\n602\n00:34:01.153 --> 00:34:02.026\n&gt;&gt; 100 pixels.\n\n603\n00:34:02.026 --> 00:34:04.572\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice with the width property,\n\n604\n00:34:04.572 --> 00:34:06.585\nit's expecting a string with a unit.\n\n605\n00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:08.351\nBecause if I don't say pixels,\nit just says 100,\n\n606\n00:34:08.351 --> 00:34:09.775\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n607\n00:34:09.775 --> 00:34:10.840\n&gt;&gt; 100 what?\n\n608\n00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.930\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?\n\n609\n00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:13.308\nI'm gonna pay you seven.\n\n610\n00:34:13.308 --> 00:34:15.153\nSeven what?\n\n611\n00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:17.050\n$7, 7 cents?\n\n612\n00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:17.985\n&gt;&gt; Seven bars of gold?\n\n613\n00:34:17.985 --> 00:34:19.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are different things.\n\n614\n00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.160\nSo units are important.\n\n615\n00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:26.750\nAnd I'm gonna say div.style.height.\n\n616\n00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:31.213\nAnd that is also,\nlet's go with 100 pixels also.\n\n617\n00:34:31.213 --> 00:34:33.490\nSo if I've done this correctly,\nI should end up with blue boxes.\n\n618\n00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:37.000\nAnd I do.\n\n619\n00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.110\nAnd notice, it doesn't quite look like,\nwhy is that, hm?\n\n620\n00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.804\n&gt;&gt; They're touching each other?\n\n621\n00:34:43.804 --> 00:34:46.380\n&gt;&gt; They are touching each other.\nThere is no border.\n\n622\n00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.900\nSo I could change that to say div.style.\n\n623\n00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.720\nAnd the space between is called margin.\n\n624\n00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.354\nI'm just gonna say 10 pixels.\n\n625\n00:34:56.354 --> 00:34:59.200\nAnd I have separate blue boxes.\n\n626\n00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.600\nBut upon page refresh,\nthese will always be blue boxes,\n\n627\n00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.662\nbecause I have selected\nall the divs on the page.\n\n628\n00:35:03.662 --> 00:35:08.660\nAnd any divs that I add afterwards\nwill also get this same application.\n\n629\n00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.630\nSo dynamically, I'm altering the page.\n\n630\n00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.530\nNow, these are examples just to\nillustrate some of the power.\n\n631\n00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.710\nAnd I've done some\nthings that you can see.\n\n632\n00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:20.100\nThat is not the only thing\nthat I would do, right?\n\n633\n00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.030\nChanging colors to really bright and\n\n634\n00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:25.590\nflashy ones or\ntext to a different font family.\n\n635\n00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.550\nThere might be some use cases,\nbut that's not all we can do.\n\n636\n00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.982\nThere's so much more.\n\n637\n00:35:29.982 --> 00:35:34.852\nBut at least you've seen a glimpse into\nthe power that is JavaScript modifying\n\n638\n00:35:34.852 --> 00:35:35.480\nthe DOM.\n\n639\n00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.036\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, Justin.\n\n640\n00:35:37.036 --> 00:35:41.335\nIt was a lot of fun to see you play with\nthe elements, watch them change, and\n\n641\n00:35:41.335 --> 00:35:44.898\ngive us that visual, almost tactile,\nvery tangible thing.\n\n642\n00:35:44.898 --> 00:35:49.690\nAnd now we can go and use those skills\nto modify our websites, our web APIs,\n\n643\n00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.050\nand the way that they need to be.\n\n644\n00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:53.695\nNot just for fun and sarcasm.\n\n645\n00:35:53.695 --> 00:35:56.380\nEven though that is a good\nreason to do things.\n\n646\n00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.950\nAt least, in my estimation.\n\n647\n00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.370\nJustin, thank you very much.\n\n648\n00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:03.350\nWe do appreciate you explaining the DOM,\nright.\n\n649\n00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:04.422\nThat's what, I'm gonna leave it at that.\n\n650\n00:36:04.422 --> 00:36:06.626\nI don't know the whole thing.\n\n651\n00:36:06.626 --> 00:36:08.373\nDocument Object Model, right?\n\n652\n00:36:08.373 --> 00:36:11.707\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is very well out of my realm of\n\n653\n00:36:11.707 --> 00:36:12.564\nexpertise.\n\n654\n00:36:12.564 --> 00:36:15.738\nBut it's a lot of fun to watch\nyou tack away at that machine and\n\n655\n00:36:15.738 --> 00:36:17.260\nmake it do cool stuff.\n\n656\n00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.840\nHopefully you guys are following along and\ndoing the things.\n\n657\n00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.570\nDefinitely try this stuff\nthat he's showing you, so\n\n658\n00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:26.360\nthat you can get some experience with it,\nand get some real practical seat time,\n\n659\n00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.040\nas I like to say,\nwith that type of experience.\n\n660\n00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.400\nThat being said, Justin,\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n661\n00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.370\nI'm looking at our clock,\nwe kind of elapsed our time.\n\n662\n00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:39.150\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n663\n00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n664\n00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.252\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n665\n00:36:41.252 --> 00:36:48.699\n[MUSIC]\n\n666\n00:36:48.699 --> 00:36:51.078\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.285\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:12.680\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.870\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.050\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.690\nwe are continuing on with more on our\nintro to Web Developments series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.975\nAnd joining me in the studio is our\nmentor and ever our good friend, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:27.900\nJustin Dennison.\n\n11\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.010\nJustin, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.310\nI'm so glad to have you there.\n\n13\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for,\nyou really struck my ego there.\n\n14\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.360\nIt makes me feel good.\n\n15\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.570\nThanks for having me.\n\n16\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.420\nI'm excited.\n\n17\n00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.245\nSo, yeah, web development.\n\n18\n00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:42.810\nWe've started down this road, but there's\na couple of things that struck me on.\n\n19\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.530\nI can make a button but it doesn't click.\n\n20\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.650\nIt doesn't actually do\nanything when I click it.\n\n21\n00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.979\nWell, we need to remedy that and\n\n22\n00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.302\nthat's actually what we're\ngonna do in this episode.\n\n23\n00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:52.075\nBut before we do,\nwe need to take a step back and\n\n24\n00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:53.660\ntalk about what are called events.\n\n25\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.954\nSo in JavaScript there are ways to\nbroadcast and listen to events.\n\n26\n00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:01.795\nNow I'm saying this in programmatic terms,\n\n27\n00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:05.839\nlets think about it in terms of\njust everyday language, right?\n\n28\n00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.620\nIf you hear someone, dinner time!\n\n29\n00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.210\nThen well that's a broadcast of an event.\n\n30\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.390\nIt's getting ready,\nwe're getting ready to eat.\n\n31\n00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.150\nSo we should probably go respond to that.\n\n32\n00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.900\nOr come in the house or don't do this.\n\n33\n00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.260\nIf you've ever heard,\nyou shouldn't say fire in a theater,\n\n34\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.860\nwell that's because that's a very\nimportant event if it does occur.\n\n35\n00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.181\nSo if you yell fire there's kind of\nappropriate responses that people\n\n36\n00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:33.750\nwill take.\n\n37\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.468\nSo in everyday language\nan event is just a happening.\n\n38\n00:01:38.468 --> 00:01:41.020\nBut with every event there is a response,\nright?\n\n39\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.000\nIf I lay my hand on the stove and\n\n40\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.980\nit's still hot,\n[SOUND] I'm gonna take my hand off.\n\n41\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.389\nWell the event was the stove was hot and\nI laid my hand on it and my response,\n\n42\n00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:55.155\nmy brain was listening it says, hey you\nbetter take your hand off the stove, and\n\n43\n00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:56.394\nI jerk my hand back.\n\n44\n00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:57.600\nSo these are events.\n\n45\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.940\nWell in JavaScript, we have the ability to\nmimic this behavior which is really handy,\n\n46\n00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.420\nbecause some part of my web app can\nactually be responding to an event\n\n47\n00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.950\nthat's occurring somewhere else.\n\n48\n00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.220\nIn JavaScript we actually\nhave a series of events and\n\n49\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.550\nI have a very comprehensive list here.\n\n50\n00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.380\nJust to make sure I have\na good breadth of these, so\n\n51\n00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.610\nwe have mouse events, anything to do\nwith the mouse, your mouse can say,\n\n52\n00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.170\nhey I'm doing stuff and\nyou can respond accordingly.\n\n53\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.150\nProgression events,\nlike the page is just starting to load.\n\n54\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.610\nThe page has fully loaded.\n\n55\n00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.220\nWe are navigating away from the page.\n\n56\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.442\nWe have keyboard events,\nhere's typing, right?\n\n57\n00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:39.202\nI press the key, I'd let go the key and\n\n58\n00:02:39.202 --> 00:02:43.560\nthose are actually different,\nkey down, key up.\n\n59\n00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.700\nThose are separate events and\n\n60\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.710\nthen a key press is a rapid\nsuccession of key down, key up.\n\n61\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.390\nSo we actually have some fine\ngrained control with those.\n\n62\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.850\nTouch events, now this is more if\nyou're building web applications or\n\n63\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.910\nan application that runs on a mobile\ndevice where a touchscreen would happen.\n\n64\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.540\nNow new computers do have\ntouch capability, but\n\n65\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.990\nyou can listen to touch\nevents within a browser.\n\n66\n00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.640\nForm events,\nwhen I summit a form it actually says,\n\n67\n00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.350\nhey I'm submitting and you can\nrespond accordingly with JavaScript.\n\n68\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.307\nYou can take control and\ngo all right I'm gonna do this special.\n\n69\n00:03:16.307 --> 00:03:18.310\nWhy would you wanna do that?\n\n70\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.810\nWell I wanna make sure that people\nare using appropriate passwords,\n\n71\n00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.310\nthey have an email address\nthat's not fake, right?\n\n72\n00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.560\nIt actually follows these\nset of validations schemes,\n\n73\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.070\nas well as other things.\n\n74\n00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.115\nI have error events, so when something\nbad happens, JavaScript will say hey,\n\n75\n00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:41.108\nsomething bad happened within\na web application context, and\n\n76\n00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:42.783\nyou can respond to those.\n\n77\n00:03:42.783 --> 00:03:44.760\nAnd then also mutation events.\n\n78\n00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.280\nNow that's where it gets a little iffy.\n\n79\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.300\nThere used to be specific mutation events.\n\n80\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.400\nThey've changed that a little bit and\nwhat I mean by mutation is,\n\n81\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.110\nif I change the color of\na paragraph tag in JavaScript,\n\n82\n00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.750\nI can listen to color changes of text.\n\n83\n00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.810\nOr font size changes or anything that\nhas mutated or changed within the DOM.\n\n84\n00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.920\nWe're not really gonna\nspend a lot of time there,\n\n85\n00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.790\ncuz I've changed that API a little bit.\n\n86\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.550\nIt's a little bit in flex from\nwhat I can tell the current time.\n\n87\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.560\nNot quite unstable or experimental,\n\n88\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.310\nbut it is different from\nthe original event paradigm.\n\n89\n00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.750\nSo, mutation events,\n\n90\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.460\nthere's a very specific use case,\nwe'll probably stay away from those.\n\n91\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.620\nI definitely say, take a look at those.\n\n92\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.280\nSee, hey I wanna see if any time it turns\nred, anything on the page turns red.\n\n93\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.000\nMaybe you really don't like red.\n\n94\n00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.930\nAny time it turns red, you wanna respond.\n\n95\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.050\nSo we'll stay away from those,\nthe real crux,\n\n96\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.183\nform events, mouse event, keyboard events.\n\n97\n00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:49.875\nAnd those last two are actually, most of\nyour interaction are keyboard events and\n\n98\n00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:52.202\nmouse events, on clicking and typing.\n\n99\n00:04:52.202 --> 00:04:56.900\nAll right, so, we should start there,\nthere is our event schema.\n\n100\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.390\nWell, how can we use this events in\nthe context of a web application?\n\n101\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.050\nWell let's go ahead and\nsee how that works out.\n\n102\n00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.010\nSo I'm gonna hop into my browser here.\n\n103\n00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.100\nSo my browser is open.\n\n104\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.020\nMy editor is open, however,\nI do not have our project set up.\n\n105\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.000\nI'm actually gonna create\na new folder called events.\n\n106\n00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.190\nAnd then inside of Adam,\nI'm going to open that project folder and\n\n107\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.620\nlet's see add project folder.\n\n108\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.910\nAnd I'm gonna come out to\nthe events folder, it is empty.\n\n109\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.030\nSo we're gonna use Adam to build that in.\n\n110\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.550\nSo, I'm gonna create a new\nfile called index.html,\n\n111\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.330\nwe're following a convention here.\n\n112\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.445\nYou could technically call\nthis whatever you wanted to,\n\n113\n00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:50.170\ncheeseburger.html, and\nthen we need to create another file,\n\n114\n00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.710\nand we're gonna say f.js,\ncuz this is our application.\n\n115\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.420\nWe're using this conventions\nthat we're gonna employ later\n\n116\n00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.250\nas we build actual web applications\ninstead of the learning process.\n\n117\n00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.740\nSo I have those two files.\n\n118\n00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.790\nI need to open my index.html\ninside of my Chrome browser.\n\n119\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.140\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n120\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.780\nDon't do that, and so I have a file,\n\n121\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.980\nopen file, and I'm going to go\ninside of events, index.html.\n\n122\n00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.174\nMake sure you have\nthe appropriate index.html.\n\n123\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.730\nSo if I can scroll back over here,\nnotice I'm inside of the events folder.\n\n124\n00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.576\nJust like that and\nI'm selecting the index.html.\n\n125\n00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:35.070\nCuz index.html is used\nin a variety of places.\n\n126\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.330\nIt's a convention as I said,\nif you select the wrong one,\n\n127\n00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.890\nthen you'll be making\nchanges in your editor, but\n\n128\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.530\nthey will not be reflected on the browser,\nso be very careful.\n\n129\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.240\nI'm gonna open the Chrome dev tools.\n\n130\n00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.558\nI can use the keyboard shortcut, but\njust as a reminder, you can go more tools,\n\n131\n00:06:49.558 --> 00:06:52.470\ndeveloper tools, always important.\n\n132\n00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.824\nSo nothing going on, that's cuz\nthere's nothing in our index.html.\n\n133\n00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:58.728\nInside of Adam and\nother editors that you may posses,\n\n134\n00:06:58.728 --> 00:07:01.773\nthere's typically a shortcut for this.\n\n135\n00:07:01.773 --> 00:07:03.819\nIf you type html and hit enter,\n\n136\n00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.150\nit will auto complete kind of\na standard set up for you.\n\n137\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.670\nAnd then at the bottom of this body tag,\nI wanna make a script tag,\n\n138\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.733\nadd a source and say app.js.\n\n139\n00:07:16.733 --> 00:07:21.751\nAll right, now I wanna make sure that's\nworking everything is hooked up,\n\n140\n00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:26.502\nconsole.log, app.js.\n\n141\n00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:27.742\nThere we go, and\n\n142\n00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:32.887\nI like to put something other than\n[LAUGH] the name of the file in there.\n\n143\n00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:34.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was reading app.js and\n\n144\n00:07:34.344 --> 00:07:38.840\nthen I typed app.js, and I just wanna\nmake sure that prints out on the console.\n\n145\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.694\nIt doesn't really matter what it prints,\n\n146\n00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:43.330\nit just to make sure everything\nis kinda hooked up together.\n\n147\n00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:49.705\nNow, there are several ways to respond\nto events, to hook up the response.\n\n148\n00:07:49.705 --> 00:07:55.919\nSo within the DOM, when I click something,\nI can hook up a response to these events.\n\n149\n00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.000\nThese are called event listeners.\n\n150\n00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.701\nThese functions that run\nwhen an event occurs.\n\n151\n00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:03.963\nSo let's take a look at the very\ncommon ways that this occurs.\n\n152\n00:08:03.963 --> 00:08:10.180\nAnd I'm gonna,\nwrite a function that says hello.\n\n153\n00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.052\nAnd all it's going to do, is console.log\n\n154\n00:08:16.298 --> 00:08:21.000\nHello, all right not really\ndoing anything of importance.\n\n155\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.187\nWe just wanna see,\n\n156\n00:08:22.187 --> 00:08:27.247\nhow can we link this function to respond\nto something happening in our HTML file.\n\n157\n00:08:27.247 --> 00:08:30.429\nSo one of the first ways that people may\n\n158\n00:08:30.429 --> 00:08:35.450\nencounter is actually with\nan inline HTML attribute.\n\n159\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.459\nSo I'm gonna create\na button called Clicky.\n\n160\n00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:44.091\nAnd then I'm gonna add a custom\nattribute called onClick.\n\n161\n00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:47.860\nAnd that Is going to run hello.\n\n162\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.758\nNotice that I say hello\nparentheses app.js.\n\n163\n00:08:52.758 --> 00:08:55.998\nAll right app.js is here\nthat's where hello is from,\n\n164\n00:08:55.998 --> 00:09:00.303\nif I have any of that out of sync,\nI won't really see what I expect to see.\n\n165\n00:09:00.303 --> 00:09:02.855\nSo, let's go see if that works.\n\n166\n00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:07.600\nRefresh and that is a tiny, tiny,\nbut that is a giant, giant.\n\n167\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.817\nYup we gotta click over over here.\n\n168\n00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:17.985\nThere we go, and notice it's clickable,\nit's doing something, what could I do?\n\n169\n00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:22.013\nWell I could modify the button,\nI could modify other buttons,\n\n170\n00:09:22.013 --> 00:09:24.450\nI could navigate to a different page.\n\n171\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.839\nI'm just using this hello\nas a proxy to that.\n\n172\n00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:31.001\nSo this is a very valid\nuse case I need this\n\n173\n00:09:31.001 --> 00:09:34.826\none event to happen when\nthis button is clicked.\n\n174\n00:09:34.826 --> 00:09:40.780\nNow click is not the only events that\nyou can have, I can have double click.\n\n175\n00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.410\nSometimes I have to check,\nI misspell that one.\n\n176\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:49.430\nSo if I click, okay, but if I\ndouble-click in rapid succession I'm now\n\n177\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.110\nlistening to a double-click event which is\ndifferent, so those are important to know.\n\n178\n00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:02.264\nBut what if I wanted to do multiple\nthings on click or on double-click?\n\n179\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.070\nWell that is a problem,\n\n180\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.562\nI only get one function if I\nuse these in line attributes.\n\n181\n00:10:09.562 --> 00:10:13.720\nI kinda, now what I could do is write\na function, that contains the call to all\n\n182\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.960\nthose other functions, and put that,\nbut now I have unmaintainable code.\n\n183\n00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.022\nI have to write functions just\nto run other functions just to\n\n184\n00:10:20.022 --> 00:10:24.020\nrun other functions, and I got winded\njust saying that, much less doing it.\n\n185\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.644\nSo there is a limitation, but\nit is something that you'll see,\n\n186\n00:10:28.644 --> 00:10:31.052\npeople will do, and it is valid.\n\n187\n00:10:31.052 --> 00:10:34.262\nIt's not necessarily the way\nI would wire up things,\n\n188\n00:10:34.262 --> 00:10:37.056\nbecause I like a little\nbit of expendability.\n\n189\n00:10:37.056 --> 00:10:40.419\nAnd also I don't have to worry about\nwriting functions that call other\n\n190\n00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:41.046\nfunctions.\n\n191\n00:10:41.046 --> 00:10:47.148\nSo this is onClick, okay, well,\nthat is one way to do that,\n\n192\n00:10:47.148 --> 00:10:53.990\nI'm going to actually duplicate this,\nbut give us an id of clicky.\n\n193\n00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.590\nDon't put the hashtag there,\nthat's implicit.\n\n194\n00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.250\nSo same button I removed\nthe onClick event handler and\n\n195\n00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.260\nwe'll take a look at some of this\nother events that can be used.\n\n196\n00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:14.658\nSo if I instead hop over on my app.js and\nI wanna grab the clicky button.\n\n197\n00:11:14.658 --> 00:11:20.005\nSo document.querySelector, And\n\n198\n00:11:20.005 --> 00:11:23.274\nI'm just gonna say the clicky button.\n\n199\n00:11:23.274 --> 00:11:25.099\nNow I have a reference to that button.\n\n200\n00:11:25.099 --> 00:11:29.135\nSo let's go back and look we looked at how\nto interact with the Dom if you haven't\n\n201\n00:11:29.135 --> 00:11:32.750\nseen the episode, or the couple of\nepisodes interacting with the Dom,\n\n202\n00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.870\ndefinitely check those\nout if you're unfamiliar.\n\n203\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.710\nThose are in the course library.\n\n204\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.333\nBut let's go look at this button,\nthere's the button,\n\n205\n00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:45.105\nit doesn't print out,\nwell I should probably use the dir so\n\n206\n00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:49.419\nI can pull that apart look at those\nproperties and I refresh, okay.\n\n207\n00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:52.224\nSo if I scroll, and\nwe kinda glazed over these,\n\n208\n00:11:52.224 --> 00:11:55.466\nyou'll notice I have a bunch\nof attributes called on.\n\n209\n00:11:55.466 --> 00:12:00.465\nOnAbort, Onauxclick,\nOnbeforecopy, Onblur, Oncancel,\n\n210\n00:12:00.465 --> 00:12:03.307\nOncanplay, these are all events.\n\n211\n00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:07.100\nSo the canplay event, well does that\nmake sense in the context of a button?\n\n212\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:15.765\nNot really, so, okay,\nwhat about onCopy, onDouble-click, yes.\n\n213\n00:12:15.765 --> 00:12:18.400\nonCue-change, that's probably a video.\n\n214\n00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.849\nonMouse enter, Mousedown, Mousemove,\nMouseout, Mouseover, Mouseup,\n\n215\n00:12:25.849 --> 00:12:31.770\nthere's actually Dragend, Dragenter,\nDragleave, Dragover, Dragstart.\n\n216\n00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.485\nSo I can look actually I click the mouse\ndown and I'm dragging that across while\n\n217\n00:12:36.485 --> 00:12:41.342\nit's clicked, I can look at the beginning\nof that, the end of that, while it's\n\n218\n00:12:41.342 --> 00:12:47.120\nhappening, I can actually get really fine\ngrained in those and it's kinda crazy.\n\n219\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.810\nBut you know I don't wanna use,\nthese may be dynamic.\n\n220\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.593\nI want to attach events\nto using JavaScript,\n\n221\n00:12:53.593 --> 00:12:57.704\nbecause I'm generating all of my\nmark up from some database call.\n\n222\n00:12:57.704 --> 00:13:01.324\nAnd this button used to be dynamic,\nand now it's wired up.\n\n223\n00:13:01.324 --> 00:13:04.100\nSo how would I go about doing that?\n\n224\n00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.353\nWell I'm gonna say, button,\n\n225\n00:13:08.353 --> 00:13:11.956\nlet's do onmouseenter.\n\n226\n00:13:11.956 --> 00:13:14.780\nAnd I'm gonna say hello,\nI put an equal sign.\n\n227\n00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.320\nSo I took the attribute and\nI wired it up to a function.\n\n228\n00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.310\nThis function is just\nconsole logging hello.\n\n229\n00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:26.420\nNotice though, unlike other functions,\nI'm not putting a parenthesis there and\n\n230\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.812\nwe'll actually see why\nthat is in just a moment.\n\n231\n00:13:28.812 --> 00:13:36.302\nSo onmouseenter which when it first\nhits the element it should run \"Hello!\".\n\n232\n00:13:36.302 --> 00:13:40.922\nSo let's refresh and there it is, and\nthere it is, and there it is, and\n\n233\n00:13:40.922 --> 00:13:41.773\nthere it is.\n\n234\n00:13:41.773 --> 00:13:45.344\nSo when I first touch it with my mouse\npointer that event's being fired,\n\n235\n00:13:45.344 --> 00:13:46.756\nthat function's running.\n\n236\n00:13:46.756 --> 00:13:51.665\nNow, if you've ever heard of things\nlike analytics or like user analytics,\n\n237\n00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:56.572\nyou can actually watch all kinds of\nstuff on a page from dragging, clicking,\n\n238\n00:13:56.572 --> 00:14:01.481\nmouseenter, and these analytics will\nsometimes say, I just wanna look\n\n239\n00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:06.766\nat these five pictures, and I wanna see\nwhich one the mouse tracks to because,\n\n240\n00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:10.400\nthat will tell me something\nabout my user base.\n\n241\n00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.480\nSo events do have a practical application\n\n242\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.530\neven outside of just printing\nhello to the console.\n\n243\n00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:22.897\nBut what's the difference between just\nsaying hello which is this function name,\n\n244\n00:14:22.897 --> 00:14:26.914\nand saying hello with the actual\nfunction parenthesis?\n\n245\n00:14:26.914 --> 00:14:29.829\nThis is a common issue that I see.\n\n246\n00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:34.530\nNotice this immediately said hello\nokay well the function ran, but\n\n247\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:39.478\nnow that event is actually not hooked up,\nand that's because the event\n\n248\n00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:44.199\nis assigned to whatever is spit out or\nreturned from this function.\n\n249\n00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.826\nWell, there's nothing returned from this\nfunction, so onmouseenter equals nothing.\n\n250\n00:14:49.826 --> 00:14:54.550\nBut if I take this away, onmouseenter is\nactually referring to this function here.\n\n251\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.222\nI could do the same thin for onmouseleave.\n\n252\n00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:08.352\nAnd get, and now I'd technical\nhave what's called a hover right?\n\n253\n00:15:08.352 --> 00:15:11.460\nI can do something when it hovers,\nsomething when it doesn't.\n\n254\n00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.320\nSo let's change this from hello and see\nmore of a practical application of this.\n\n255\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.352\nSo I'm gonna take hello and I'm gonna say,\n\n256\n00:15:21.352 --> 00:15:26.114\nlet's just say darken, and I'm going to\n\n257\n00:15:26.114 --> 00:15:30.890\nsay button.style.backgroundColor.\n\n258\n00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.004\nAnd just to extenuate it,\nI'm gonna say black.\n\n259\n00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:41.182\nAnd I'm gonna have another\nfunction called lighten.\n\n260\n00:15:43.532 --> 00:15:46.695\nI'm gonna say\nbutton.style.backgroundColor.\n\n261\n00:15:48.992 --> 00:15:52.143\nAnd that's white, all right,\ndarken and lighten.\n\n262\n00:15:52.143 --> 00:15:58.475\nSo, onmouseenter, I want to darken,\nonmouseleave, I want to Lighten.\n\n263\n00:15:58.475 --> 00:16:01.159\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be fun, cuz you're gonna\nhave a white button on a white background.\n\n264\n00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:03.041\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am.\n\n265\n00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:04.225\nYeah, I am.\n\n266\n00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:05.195\nBut I could hide things.\n\n267\n00:16:05.195 --> 00:16:06.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I could hide things.\n\n268\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:11.590\nSo if we refresh, it has the general\nstyle on page load, right?\n\n269\n00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.430\nNothing's actually changed that yet.\n\n270\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.040\nBut if I hover, there's my darken.\n\n271\n00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.012\nAnd there's my white.\n\n272\n00:16:18.012 --> 00:16:20.376\nNow because of the default button styles.\n\n273\n00:16:20.376 --> 00:16:20.990\n&gt;&gt; You get the border.\n\n274\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.770\n&gt;&gt; I get the border.\n\n275\n00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.320\nSo sneaky, sneaky, sneaky.\n\n276\n00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.140\nBut notice, I'm sure you've seen this type\n\n277\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.490\nof interaction on a website\nthat you've visited, the hover.\n\n278\n00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.940\nThere are simpler ways to do this, but\n\n279\n00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.890\noriginally JavaScript, kind of was\nbuilt for things just like this.\n\n280\n00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.460\nThis subtle hover.\n\n281\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.710\nTypically you're not going to\nflip between black and white.\n\n282\n00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:45.020\nIt's gonna be blue,\na little brighter blue.\n\n283\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.070\nSo it's gonna be real subtle.\n\n284\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.730\nYou don't want in your\nface contrast like this.\n\n285\n00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.880\nBut notice, I've wired these up for\nthe exact same button.\n\n286\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.440\nAnd they're changing back and forth and\n\n287\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.300\nthey're actually doing what's\ncalled a flip flop or a switch.\n\n288\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.920\nBut what if onmouseenter I wanted it to,\n\n289\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.248\nshould have deleted this hello function.\n\n290\n00:17:10.248 --> 00:17:14.130\nI wanted it to say Hello and turn black.\n\n291\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.393\nWell, Daniel, you got any ideas?\n\n292\n00:17:20.393 --> 00:17:21.890\nWhat do you think?\n\n293\n00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:22.681\nGot a guess?\n\n294\n00:17:22.681 --> 00:17:23.574\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n295\n00:17:23.574 --> 00:17:30.075\nI'm thinking that you're gonna have to\nconnect one function to other functions.\n\n296\n00:17:30.075 --> 00:17:34.490\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel's been listening,\nhe's got it.\n\n297\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.490\nLet's see why that would be the case.\n\n298\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.570\nSo onmouseenter I want it to darken and\nsay Hello.\n\n299\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.639\nSo I wanna attach two\nevents to a mouseenter.\n\n300\n00:17:42.639 --> 00:17:49.828\nSo button.onmouseenter and\nhello just like we had before.\n\n301\n00:17:49.828 --> 00:17:52.680\nAll right, cool, well,\nI think this might get it.\n\n302\n00:17:53.690 --> 00:18:00.270\nSo refresh, well, we got hello but\nwe didn't get the darken.\n\n303\n00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.080\nWhy didn't we get the darken?\n\n304\n00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.140\nAnd that's because this\nexecutes from top to bottom.\n\n305\n00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.140\nIt was first attached to darken.\n\n306\n00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:13.230\nAnd when this line ran, that overwrote\nthe darken and now attached it to hello.\n\n307\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.240\nSo you only get one using\nthese properties like this.\n\n308\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.210\nI get one event onmouseenter.\n\n309\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.118\nBut that's not always,\nDaniel alluded to it.\n\n310\n00:18:22.118 --> 00:18:26.194\nI probably am back to the point where I\nhave to write a function that wraps those\n\n311\n00:18:26.194 --> 00:18:27.398\nother two functions.\n\n312\n00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.048\nWell, let's see how messy that can get.\n\n313\n00:18:32.048 --> 00:18:39.370\nSo I'm going to say wrapper and all\nthat's gonna do is say hello and darken.\n\n314\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.680\n&gt;&gt; So\nit just calls those two other functions?\n\n315\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.653\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n316\n00:18:42.653 --> 00:18:47.594\nSo now, I\n\n317\n00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:52.240\ncan say wrapper and\nI'm getting the behavior I expect.\n\n318\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.241\nBut I had to add code just to wrap other\ncode to get around this limitation.\n\n319\n00:18:57.241 --> 00:19:00.010\nI don't know about you, but\nthat kind of feels dirty to me.\n\n320\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:04.060\n&gt;&gt; Can you reset the value to\nwhere it says, okay, I ran one and\n\n321\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.938\nnow it's reset back to 0 so\nit doesn't feel like it's run something?\n\n322\n00:19:08.938 --> 00:19:10.600\n&gt;&gt; I think you're on to something, Daniel.\n\n323\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.820\nI think you're on to something.\n\n324\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.730\nIt's like you're reading my mind.\n\n325\n00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.772\nIt's kinda freaking me out.\n\n326\n00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:15.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm in your head.\n\n327\n00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.730\n&gt;&gt; I'm in your head.\n\n328\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.890\nIt's actually, there's an additional\nway where I can build a collection\n\n329\n00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.020\nof handlers to run on a specific event.\n\n330\n00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.960\nThis allows me to attach one.\n\n331\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.308\nIf I need one, this is quick.\n\n332\n00:19:29.308 --> 00:19:29.870\nIt's easy.\n\n333\n00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.604\nIt's simple syntax.\n\n334\n00:19:31.604 --> 00:19:36.681\nBut in newer browsers, notice I say in\nnewer browsers, and when I say newer\n\n335\n00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:42.670\nI'm talking Chromes on Version 55, or\nsomething like that in current time.\n\n336\n00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.720\nThis was in Chrome 40,\n30 somewhere around in there.\n\n337\n00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.057\nSo that's just a general range.\n\n338\n00:19:48.057 --> 00:19:51.236\nSo this been around for a while.\n\n339\n00:19:51.236 --> 00:19:53.770\nLet's compare that.\n\n340\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:58.490\nIf I have a button or any HTML element,\n\n341\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.680\nI can say add event listener.\n\n342\n00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:09.730\nIn the event listener, well, okay,\nall right, the arguments go what event\n\n343\n00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:16.940\nclick or let's keep it mouseenter.\n\n344\n00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:22.500\nNow notice this string is not on\nmouseenter, it's just mouseenter.\n\n345\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.980\nSo if I'm using addEventListener,\nI just cut the on off, just chop it off.\n\n346\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.560\n&gt;&gt; Helps keep things from getting\na little discombobulated.\n\n347\n00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I don't need\nthe addEventListener, well, onmouseenter.\n\n348\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.700\nWell, why am I saying it's kind\nof like I'm saying it twice.\n\n349\n00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.140\nDouble, double, talk,\ntalk, right, it's weird.\n\n350\n00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.973\nAnd then what function do I wanna okay,\nwell, I wanna darken.\n\n351\n00:20:44.973 --> 00:20:50.843\nAnd I wanna add event listener for\n\n352\n00:20:50.843 --> 00:20:54.413\nmouseenter again.\n\n353\n00:20:54.413 --> 00:20:59.368\nAnd I want to say hello, and for\n\n354\n00:20:59.368 --> 00:21:05.630\nmouseleave, I want to lighten.\n\n355\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.351\nNow notice, I now have three lines, right?\n\n356\n00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.370\nI've written a little more code.\n\n357\n00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.900\nBut I've written more code to begin with,\nwith this wrapper function.\n\n358\n00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.630\nLet's see if this achieves, it does.\n\n359\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.700\nNotice Hello is also printing and\nI'm getting the hover.\n\n360\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.750\nUsing event listener,\nI can attach multiple events.\n\n361\n00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.860\nI tend to use addEventListener as my main\nmethod of attaching events especially\n\n362\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.900\nif I know I may need additional\nones in the future, right?\n\n363\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.090\nAdditional mouseenter for\nthis particular element.\n\n364\n00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.140\nSo for this button I'm\nlistening to the mouseenter and\n\n365\n00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.060\nwhen that occurs,\nI want to run darken and hello.\n\n366\n00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.070\nThis is achieved in the same way\nusing that wrapper function.\n\n367\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:51.090\nBut now I'm gonna have to think of names\nthat describe what these functions do.\n\n368\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:58.133\nSo instead of wrapper,\nI could say darkenAndHello, right?\n\n369\n00:21:58.133 --> 00:22:01.260\nThat is descriptive, but\nhere I'm just reading my list.\n\n370\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.560\nIt's gonna darken, it's called say hello.\n\n371\n00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.880\nAnd then on leave it's going to lighten.\n\n372\n00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.460\nSo this is more declarative in nature.\n\n373\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.520\nI tend to go with this one.\n\n374\n00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.540\nNow you gotta be careful.\n\n375\n00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.720\nSo there's this key word\nin JavaScript called this.\n\n376\n00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:25.799\nIf you type it in your editor it\nactually does some let's just log this.\n\n377\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.150\nOkay, so if I logged this, and\n\n378\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.350\nyou actually gotta take out\nthe wrapper function cuz I deleted it.\n\n379\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.151\nThis will change context.\n\n380\n00:22:38.151 --> 00:22:42.230\nAnd you'll see, I'm showing you this and\nthis is why I don't like the word this.\n\n381\n00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.650\nBecause I say the word\nthis when describing\n\n382\n00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.369\nwhat the keyword this mean in JavaScript.\n\n383\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.840\nTypically it refers to the window object,\n\n384\n00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:55.350\nthat global browser object,\nunless I put it inside of a function.\n\n385\n00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:04.930\nSo for hello, I can say console.log(this).\n\n386\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:09.130\nAnd if I refresh, and\nsay Hello in the browser,\n\n387\n00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:14.090\nnotice it stills says Window\nas the context of this.\n\n388\n00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:21.859\nBut I’m gonna leave the keyword,\nthis, inside of this function.\n\n389\n00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:28.010\nAnd I hover over, if I scroll down here,\nactually let me refresh and I hover over.\n\n390\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:33.720\nNotice this,\nthe keyword this now refers to the button.\n\n391\n00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.000\nSo in event handlers, if I use the keyword\nthis inside of the function, for\n\n392\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.630\ninstance Hello, I can refer to the element\n\n393\n00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:47.360\nthat the event kind of came from it,\nversioned forth and gave life.\n\n394\n00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.539\nI show you there because I tend to write\ncode that's a little bit like that.\n\n395\n00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:52.193\nSo we'll keep seeing this over and\nover and over again.\n\n396\n00:23:52.193 --> 00:23:57.110\nWe'll see this construct which\nis actually the this key word.\n\n397\n00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:02.000\nI'll have to figure out a better way\nto convey those two differences there.\n\n398\n00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.570\nSo, that's something to keep in\nmind especially if you see that.\n\n399\n00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:12.940\nBut also, when you run an event function,\nI get some interesting things here.\n\n400\n00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:20.790\nI'm just going to say, this hello is going\nto receive an argument called event.\n\n401\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.500\nI'm naming an event.\n\n402\n00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.700\nThere's nothing special about that.\n\n403\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.590\nI could call it bacon.\n\n404\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.350\nAnd this is because it's\nattached to this event listener.\n\n405\n00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:33.430\nWhen the event listener runs, it's gonna\npipe that event into that function.\n\n406\n00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:39.230\nSo let's see what that is and notice,\nit says hey, that was a mouse event.\n\n407\n00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.290\nAnd I get all of this information\nlike where was the movement?\n\n408\n00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.330\nWhere was the offset?\n\n409\n00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.486\nWhat part of the page was it on?\n\n410\n00:24:45.486 --> 00:24:47.850\nWhat part of the screen was it on?\n\n411\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.460\nThe source element, the target.\n\n412\n00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.030\nSo I actually have an ability to grab\n\n413\n00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.840\nwhat element just kind of\ngave forth to the event.\n\n414\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.040\nSo that is an alternative\nto using the disk keyword.\n\n415\n00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.590\nThose are good things to know and\nwe'll see those,\n\n416\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.940\nI think those will make a little more\nsense when we use them in context.\n\n417\n00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.450\nI'm just giving you an idea\nthat those are available.\n\n418\n00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.902\nOne final thing in order\nbrowser implementations,\n\n419\n00:25:16.902 --> 00:25:23.298\nthe onclick in the HTML\nwhich is over here and\n\n420\n00:25:23.298 --> 00:25:28.470\nthe onclick here for the most part worked.\n\n421\n00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.210\nThis is rather recent.\n\n422\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.396\nAnd some browser manufactures\nactually decided,\n\n423\n00:25:33.396 --> 00:25:35.919\nI'm gonna figure out my own way to do it.\n\n424\n00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:40.006\nFor instance, IE, Internet Explorer,\n\n425\n00:25:40.006 --> 00:25:46.250\nhad things like attachevent,\nactiveX attach event.\n\n426\n00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.810\nSo if you're seeing these old browsers,\nyou'll see some code.\n\n427\n00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:56.419\nLet's see,\naddEventListener JavaScript MDN.\n\n428\n00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.930\nAnd if I look here,\nit will tell me about all these and\n\n429\n00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:07.300\nif I scroll MDN typically tells\nme when was this available.\n\n430\n00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.290\nRight at the very bottom\nit tells me the browsers.\n\n431\n00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.010\nI was wrong, I was way off on Chrome.\n\n432\n00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.220\nChrome is since version 1 has\nbeen using addEvent listeners.\n\n433\n00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.330\nSo it's always been available in Chrome.\n\n434\n00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.080\nEdge, yep.\n\n435\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.540\nIt was only at version nine that addEvent\nlistener started to come into play.\n\n436\n00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.990\nNotice there's a footnote here.\n\n437\n00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:33.283\nOlder versions of Internet Explorer\nsupport the proprietary attachEvent\n\n438\n00:26:33.283 --> 00:26:34.017\nargument.\n\n439\n00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.980\nLet's zoom that in just a touch here.\n\n440\n00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:41.140\nIf I click,\nMDN will actually tell me about that.\n\n441\n00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.140\nBut notice it flags it as non-standard.\n\n442\n00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.400\nThis feature is non-standard and\n\n443\n00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.810\ndoes not track with the JavaScript web\nAPI standards, the HTML standards.\n\n444\n00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:56.910\nDo not use it on production phasing\nwebsites, it will not work for every user.\n\n445\n00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.380\nWhy would I ever need to use this?\n\n446\n00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:06.550\nMaybe I have a client that they're entire\nuser base is still using IE 8, 7 or\n\n447\n00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.520\nI don't even know if 6 has\nJavaScript readily available in it.\n\n448\n00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.660\nI try to stay away from\nthose security issues,\n\n449\n00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.930\nthey're hard to maintain,\nthey're very particular use case.\n\n450\n00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:23.700\nBut if you do have a need, do keep in\nmind that attachEvent was the specific\n\n451\n00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:29.290\nimplementation for doing the exact\nsame thing addEventListener did.\n\n452\n00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.680\nBut I like this little table because it\nlet's me know hey, these are available.\n\n453\n00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.370\nAlso it tells you specific use cases, so\n\n454\n00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:41.060\nlike touchEvents, some of the touchEvents\nare only in recent versions.\n\n455\n00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.670\nAnd some even newer browsers\nstill didn't have support.\n\n456\n00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:48.040\nSo I like these little grids and you\ncan also get mobile ones, so Chrome for\n\n457\n00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.835\nAndroid, Edge,IE mobile,\nso on and so forth.\n\n458\n00:27:51.835 --> 00:27:56.715\nSo that's a cursory glance at events, how\nto use events, how to respond to events.\n\n459\n00:27:56.715 --> 00:28:00.288\nBut I really think the power gets\nillustrated when we finally decide how to\n\n460\n00:28:00.288 --> 00:28:02.604\nbuild a web application\nwhere events are used.\n\n461\n00:28:02.604 --> 00:28:06.578\nWhere they're actually I see how these\nwork, I see your just not printing to\n\n462\n00:28:06.578 --> 00:28:10.590\nthe console or changing colors or\ndoing weird little hover things.\n\n463\n00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:15.708\nThis is actually doing something\nof reasonable complexity.\n\n464\n00:28:15.708 --> 00:28:20.100\nSo cursory glance at events, but\nthey will be coming back to us.\n\n465\n00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.910\n&gt;&gt; Wow, it still is really cool to be\nable to watch you make the website,\n\n466\n00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.650\ndo something in reaction to something\nthat our end user has done.\n\n467\n00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.190\nSo that's still really cool and\nit sets the stage for\n\n468\n00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.110\nyou to be able to build upon\nthat in our upcoming episode.\n\n469\n00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.510\nSo very cool stuff, Justin.\n\n470\n00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:38.290\nWe appreciate you showing us how to\nget started at least with the events.\n\n471\n00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:42.230\nLooking forward to see how that\ndevelops later on in the series.\n\n472\n00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.930\nThat being said, looking at our clock,\nit looks like we've run out of time for\n\n473\n00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:46.070\nthis episode.\n\n474\n00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.335\nSo we're gonna add, sign off for ITProTV.\n\n475\n00:28:48.335 --> 00:28:50.337\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n476\n00:28:50.337 --> 00:28:51.406\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Denison.\n\n477\n00:28:51.406 --> 00:28:52.287\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n478\n00:28:52.287 --> 00:28:59.939\n[MUSIC]\n\n479\n00:28:59.939 --> 00:29:01.970\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.286\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:12.459\nYou're watching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.790\ngreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.710\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we are continuing\n\n7\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.910\nour series on the Introduction To\nWeb Development and, of course,\n\n8\n00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.780\njoining us in the studio is our resident\nexpert on that topic, Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n9\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.830\nJustin, welcome back sir.\n\n10\n00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.720\nHow goes it today?\n\n11\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.130\n&gt;&gt; It goes well thanks for\nhaving me back and how are you today?\n\n12\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.240\n&gt;&gt; I can't complain thanks.\n\n13\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.870\n&gt;&gt; That is always good to hear.\n\n14\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.550\nYeah, web development.\n\n15\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.510\nThose are some scary words sometimes but\n\n16\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.590\nhopefully we're gonna slowly make our\nway to where you're like a-ha, right?\n\n17\n00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.210\nThe little light bulb that comes\non in various cartoons and\n\n18\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.990\nsome live action movies if they're\nreally interesting live action movies.\n\n19\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.910\nBut today, we're actually gonna talk\nabout data storage in the browser.\n\n20\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.570\nNow before we actually look at any methods\nfor storing information in the browser,\n\n21\n00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.430\nincluding using browser tools\nto inspect that information,\n\n22\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.260\nI do wanna emphasize something.\n\n23\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.770\nData storage in a browser is more or\nless kind of like a caching layer, right?\n\n24\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.240\nI wanna make sure that I don't lose\nthis if the browser crashes or\n\n25\n00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.800\nI close it on accident.\n\n26\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.530\nAnd I don't know about you but there's\nbeen a couple times where I mean to close\n\n27\n00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.200\nthe tab and I close the whole browser and\nthen it kinda ruins my day.\n\n28\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.480\nBut it is nice to have an ability to\nalmost take a polaroid, a snapshot,\n\n29\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.980\nand keep that in the browser.\n\n30\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.270\nIt is not for long term data storage.\n\n31\n00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.320\nI am not going to store\nall of my photo URLs or\n\n32\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.830\nall of image, the actual image files,\nin the browser.\n\n33\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.340\nThese are purely for keeping those\nlittle snip-its of information.\n\n34\n00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.070\nThat maybe important upon\nreopening the browser,\n\n35\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.520\npage refresh, things of that nature but\nI'll highlight those as they come along.\n\n36\n00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.040\nNow one of the first topics that we're\ngoing to actually look at is cookies.\n\n37\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.927\nAnd not the wonderful num, num,\nnum Heath bar cookies I'm telling you,\n\n38\n00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:57.449\nthey are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.\n\n39\n00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:58.639\n&gt;&gt; You put one of those\non top of your head and\n\n40\n00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.328\nyour tongue will beat your\nbrains out trying to get to it.\n\n41\n00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:03.188\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so cookies,\n\n42\n00:02:03.188 --> 00:02:06.010\nkind of a weird name but what is a cookie?\n\n43\n00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.200\nTypically you've heard of\ncookies as they're tracking you.\n\n44\n00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.640\nThey're always watching you.\n\n45\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.660\nAnd that is definitely\na valid use case but\n\n46\n00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.670\na lot of times cookies are a way of\nstoring, are you logged in, right?\n\n47\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.440\nHave you ever clicked that button when you\nlog in to a service that says Remember Me?\n\n48\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.670\nSome of those services may use\ncookies in order to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.510\nNow, the down side of cookies, though\nthey have been around for a while and\n\n50\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.480\nare fairly still available in all browser\nimplementations as far as I know.\n\n51\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.640\nIf you find out different,\nplease let me know.\n\n52\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.170\nI've tried to find out if that's the case.\n\n53\n00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.240\nBut cookies,\n\n54\n00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.560\nsometimes people get, they're like,\nI don't want cookies stored on my machine.\n\n55\n00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.600\nI don't want cookies in the browser.\n\n56\n00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.830\nPeople were tracking me and\n\n57\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.180\nas I said, there are times\nwhere people do that, right?\n\n58\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.090\nSites track your usage using cookies.\n\n59\n00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.780\nSo they'll turn cookies off.\n\n60\n00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.660\nSo maybe that's not the best way to\nstore information for your site.\n\n61\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.510\nBecause people have\nthe ability to turn that off.\n\n62\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.490\nAnd if your site depends on that, your web\napplication depends on storing information\n\n63\n00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.600\nin cookies, well,\nyour site doesn't work anymore.\n\n64\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.320\nIt's kinda like,\nI bought this real nice car and\n\n65\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.720\nthen I took the engine out of it and\nnow I just don't really have a car.\n\n66\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.990\nIt's more like a push cart.\n\n67\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.590\nSo but, before we talk about\nthe other parts of data storage.\n\n68\n00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.210\nLet's use the Chrome DEV Tools,\nlook at the cookies,\n\n69\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.310\ncreate a cookie, not bake a cookie.\n\n70\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.490\nMan I'm getting hungry just thinking about\nthis and see how these are actually used.\n\n71\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.740\nSo, let's go hot down\nthere on the browser.\n\n72\n00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.940\nYou don't actually need a project or\nanything for these.\n\n73\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.350\nMost of this work will be done\nin the Chrome Dev Tools and\n\n74\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.240\nthis is a little extra bang for\n\n75\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.780\nyour buck is I'm gonna show you some\nadditional parts of the Chrome Dev Tools.\n\n76\n00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.480\nSo you can inspect, look around.\n\n77\n00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.490\nAnd I will tell you there\nare far expense regions of\n\n78\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.200\nthe Chrome Dev Tools that\nI still don't know about.\n\n79\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.240\nI try to find out something new\nperiodically, but if I wanted\n\n80\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.830\nto inspect what cookies were already on my\nmachine, what are cached in my browser.\n\n81\n00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.380\nIf I come over to, typically you'll\nsee these little highlights here.\n\n82\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.090\nWe've been in the console a great deal but\n\n83\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.360\nif you do not see all of these it will be\na kind of greater than greater than sign.\n\n84\n00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.690\nIf you click it and\n\n85\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.150\nlet me see if I can zoom in there, you'll\nnotice there's some drop downs here.\n\n86\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.060\nI want to go to the Application portion,\nand in the Application portion,\n\n87\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.120\nI actually have all of the list of storage\navailable within the Chrome browser.\n\n88\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.230\nNow, also notice there's a cache storage.\n\n89\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.970\nThis is a little shorter lived.\n\n90\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.200\nThese storages are more persistent,\nbut can be still be very short term.\n\n91\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.920\nAnd also,\nwe won't talk about all of these,\n\n92\n00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.540\nbecause the immediate use cases I\nwant to store just simple things.\n\n93\n00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.300\nKnow about how things are stored in the\nbrowser, right, whether it be username.\n\n94\n00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.840\nDefinitely don't store\nsensitive information, because,\n\n95\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.170\nas you'll see if I want to find out\nabout cookies I can actually just click,\n\n96\n00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.090\nthe drop-down and click, cookies, and\nnotice I have no cookies on this site.\n\n97\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.530\nThis site is not storing a cookie and\nthat's because I'm not actually on a site,\n\n98\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.990\nI'm just in an open Chrome tab,\nthat has not navigated to a site yet.\n\n99\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.100\nBut again, I'm in an application tab,\nor Chrome Dev tools and\n\n100\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.780\nI'm looking under the storage portion,\nat cookies.\n\n101\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.508\nWell, let's actually go to a site.\n\n102\n00:05:23.508 --> 00:05:28.260\nSo here's google.com and I click.\n\n103\n00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.920\nAnd notice when I click it's\ndoesn't say no cookies anymore.\n\n104\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.880\nIt actually says there's a name,\na value and it's kind of hard to see.\n\n105\n00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.580\nI'll drag these over so we can see\na domain, a path, now what is the path?\n\n106\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.792\nThere's actually, Whenever you type .com,\n\n107\n00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:50.750\nthere's a slash there that says,\nthis is the root of this website.\n\n108\n00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.330\nSo keep that in mind,\nthat's kinda one of those weird things.\n\n109\n00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.260\nAnd if you do, click it again,\nit'll refresh, just to see and then,\n\n110\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.070\nit has an Expires.\n\n111\n00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.830\nAnd I have to drag this over just so\nwe can see all of these.\n\n112\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.220\nI'll probably have to drag these back, but\n\n113\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.680\nnotice this cookie expires,\nactually a good long time from now.\n\n114\n00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.730\n8 19 2017, August 19th of 2017 and\n\n115\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.140\nit gives you a size, as well as,\nis it coming from HTTP.\n\n116\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.090\nIs it secure?\n\n117\n00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.590\nAnd is it,\ncan't really get that to pull over here.\n\n118\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.850\nHere we go, nope, gotta try it.\n\n119\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.160\nThere is probably a better way to do this,\nI have not found out the better way.\n\n120\n00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.480\nSame site, what does same site mean?\n\n121\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.160\nI don't know, but these other things\nare defiantly of interest to me.\n\n122\n00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.634\nSo let's see if I can refresh and\nget that cookie tab,\n\n123\n00:06:46.634 --> 00:06:51.960\nno, I have botched it up for\nyou by rearranging these tabs over here.\n\n124\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:59.244\nAnd what I really want to know is,\nwell I want to drag these back over.\n\n125\n00:07:02.414 --> 00:07:05.572\nThe force touch is not\nplaying nice with me, Daniel.\n\n126\n00:07:05.572 --> 00:07:08.730\n&gt;&gt; It’s not your best friend when it\ncomes to click and slide kind of things.\n\n127\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the click and slide,\nI’m like what are you doing.\n\n128\n00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.700\nSo, we have that fixed.\n\n129\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.100\nThanks for hanging in there with me.\n\n130\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.000\nI was about to abandon it myself.\n\n131\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.470\nBut we have the name of the cookie, value\nthat it holds, where it comes from, and\n\n132\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.790\nits expiration date.\n\n133\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.110\nSo I can inspect sites.\n\n134\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.440\nLet's look at one more site.\n\n135\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.550\nLet's look at one of our\nfavorite developer Mozilla.org.\n\n136\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.655\nSo if I navigate to Mozilla and I actually\nclick on cookies this site has no cookies.\n\n137\n00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:39.735\nAnd well, that's not the only\nway to store information, but\n\n138\n00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:42.615\ndo keep in mind that not all sites\nshould use cookies in order to\n\n139\n00:07:42.615 --> 00:07:46.975\npersist these little tidbits of\ninformation about your use cases, right?\n\n140\n00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:48.645\nIt may be because you're logged in,\n\n141\n00:07:48.645 --> 00:07:51.745\nit may be because they need to\nkeep things up to date, right?\n\n142\n00:07:51.745 --> 00:07:53.695\nThey're just keeping\ntrack of what day it is,\n\n143\n00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:58.210\nor how many times you've visited that\nsite, and if you don't want those,\n\n144\n00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.220\nyou can definitely turn those off,\nthrough the settings of your browser.\n\n145\n00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.490\nNow I'm not gonna cover that because it\nwould be very specific to Chrome, for\n\n146\n00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.790\nturning those off.\n\n147\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.800\nDo take time to look\nthose up if you want to.\n\n148\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.790\nSo we've seen cookies here,\nhow do we actually make cookies.\n\n149\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.800\nIf i wanted to create a cookie\non my site and use it right?\n\n150\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.410\nI just want to store,\nthere is the username just for\n\n151\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.330\na quick look up,\nhow will I go about doing it?\n\n152\n00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.790\nWell in the console you'll\nsee are we got our blinker,\n\n153\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.310\nright our little cursor,\nour little blink cursor here.\n\n154\n00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.329\nIf I type document now document has\nto do with this particular document.\n\n155\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.390\nIf I type document.cookie.\n\n156\n00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.250\nWell that's interesting.\n\n157\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.050\nIt doesn't show in the Chrome dev tools,\nbut\n\n158\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.120\nthat's because it's only showing me for\nthe site.\n\n159\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.080\nThat does not mean that there are not\nother cookies kind of hanging around.\n\n160\n00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.910\nAlso, keep in mind,\nwe didn't see cookies initially.\n\n161\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.380\nSometimes cookies happen\nover some amount of time.\n\n162\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.820\nBut that's not what we're worried about,\nwe wanna know how to make a cookie.\n\n163\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:08.950\nI wanna say document.cookie and it equals\nand it's just gonna equal a string.\n\n164\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.450\nNow a cookie has a very particular\nkind of organizational pattern.\n\n165\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.768\nBut you don't have to adhere by\nthat I'm going to say My First\n\n166\n00:09:16.768 --> 00:09:21.660\ncookie!, okay, well that's nice.\n\n167\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:27.840\nIf we go back to the application then,\nand we go oop, where did you go?\n\n168\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.646\nYou're not gonna play nice on that.\n\n169\n00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:35.850\nSo, if you are,\nyou want to take a look at the cookies\n\n170\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.810\nand you can't get the application\ntab to work out for you.\n\n171\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.780\nSometimes it doesn't quite persist because\nit's looking for this domain only.\n\n172\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.610\nThe cookie that was just generated is\nnot for the domain that we are on.\n\n173\n00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.090\nIf I type document.cookie,\n\n174\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.667\nnotice the very first part of\nthe string is my first cookie.\n\n175\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.955\nSo, let's see if we can\nget these to crop up and\n\n176\n00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:04.930\nin actual tab that does not\nhave any website running in it.\n\n177\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:12.310\nSee if we can get that application to add\nhere and work for us, so if I look, no.\n\n178\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.380\nSo you keep in mind, sometimes\nthese are a little out of sync but\n\n179\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:22.670\nthese are handy and they work well for\nthe most part on inspecting these cookies.\n\n180\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.450\nSo that's how you make a cookie.\n\n181\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.680\nNow when will I actually use a cookie?\n\n182\n00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.167\nBetter use case, instead of saying,\nmy first cookie.\n\n183\n00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:37.790\nSay document.cookie equals, and let say\nsomeone someone just logs in your site.\n\n184\n00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.940\nYou have log in site,\nyou just wanna store their username.\n\n185\n00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.360\nBecause their username is kinda\nthe gateway to all their look ups.\n\n186\n00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.510\nYou log into the social media, your\nusername is going on at data services.\n\n187\n00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:54.000\nAnd the data services is going, okay\nlet me go figure out what you need for\n\n188\n00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.950\nthat user name and send it back to you.\n\n189\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:01.070\nSo if I wanted to, I could just take\nthe user name, store it in a Cookie,\n\n190\n00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.810\nokay that looks very\nsimilar to what we did.\n\n191\n00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.040\nLet's see if it persisted this time.\n\n192\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.364\nAnd it's still not playing nice with us.\n\n193\n00:11:12.231 --> 00:11:16.800\nBut if I look at the cookie\nobject notice it is also empty.\n\n194\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.400\nWell, why is that?\n\n195\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.540\nWe just made a cookie.\n\n196\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.320\nWe made a cookie just a little\nwhile ago and it worked.\n\n197\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.380\nIt's empty here.\n\n198\n00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.310\nYou'll notice I'm not actually on a site.\n\n199\n00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.470\nWell if I'm not on a site I wonder if\nthat affects the behavior of the cookie.\n\n200\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.880\nSo, let's just navigate to a site.\n\n201\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.050\nMaybe, maybe turn in, there we go.\n\n202\n00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:42.034\nAnd then I'm going to do\nthe exact same cookie =\n\n203\n00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:46.843\nusername = smcgilly.\n\n204\n00:11:46.843 --> 00:11:48.600\nAll right, there we go.\n\n205\n00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.760\nSo now, let's take a look at Google and\n\n206\n00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.150\nyou will see that the cookie\nhas in fact been made.\n\n207\n00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.330\nSo if you're not on a site but\nyou're still within the Chrome browser\n\n208\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.790\nlike on that tab before I navigate\nanywhere, you may get weird behavior.\n\n209\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:07.590\nAnd I will tell you sometimes that\ncookie will get made on the empty tab.\n\n210\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.840\nIt'll work sometimes, sometimes it won't.\n\n211\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.130\nSo do keep that in mind,\nif you're not on the site and\n\n212\n00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.450\nthe site's not the one kind\nof persisting that then boom.\n\n213\n00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:23.210\nAlso notice that I periodically get weird\nbehavior when I'm messing with the cookies\n\n214\n00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:28.140\nbecause they won't persist in the correct\ndomain and there are ways to set that.\n\n215\n00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.409\nThat's a little beyond the scope because\nyou can kind of spoof and do bad things.\n\n216\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.720\nSo just keeping in mind you're making it\nweird behavior if you're not in a website,\n\n217\n00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.700\nyou also are making it weird behavior\nif you're manually creating cookies\n\n218\n00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.510\non a site that is not yours, right?\n\n219\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.685\nIt's not JavaScript running from\nan application that you've created.\n\n220\n00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:52.195\nNow, with that said, [COUGH] if we\nlook back at the cookie object,\n\n221\n00:12:52.195 --> 00:12:54.290\nwe still have that there.\n\n222\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.450\nWell, that's nice.\n\n223\n00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.155\nHow would I clear that?\n\n224\n00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:04.061\nI can actually just send that to\nan empty string, but does that clear it?\n\n225\n00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:11.160\nAnd notice it does not, okay, well,\nhow can I poke around on this?\n\n226\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.020\nI can actually select the cookie\nfrom this window and just delete it.\n\n227\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.270\nIf I'm playing around that's\nsomething you may want to do, but\n\n228\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.230\nwhat if I want this cookie to go away?\n\n229\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.080\nWhat if I want it to expire and\nkind of delete itself?\n\n230\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.430\nThat is a little more involved so\nbear with me.\n\n231\n00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.050\nLet's say I want to store the user name\nfor some arbitrary number of time.\n\n232\n00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.180\nLet's just say three days, right.\n\n233\n00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.006\nSo if I say document.cookie equals\n\n234\n00:13:39.006 --> 00:13:44.090\nusername, notice I have\na semi colon inside.\n\n235\n00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:49.250\nIf I hit space I can give what\nis called an expiration date.\n\n236\n00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.940\nSo expires equals and\nthen here's where it gets fun.\n\n237\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:59.947\nI have to do some concatenation and\ncreate a new date object and\n\n238\n00:13:59.947 --> 00:14:06.500\nnew date and\nlet's just say it expires right now, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.380\nHopefully we can see\nthis really quickly and\n\n240\n00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:17.230\nI need to add a semicolon as the end\nof this portion, don't hit Save.\n\n241\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.134\nSo if I hit Enter, notice it says,\n\n242\n00:14:20.134 --> 00:14:26.360\nusername=smcgilly, and\nthen expires at this time.\n\n243\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.200\nOkay, well, if we come back over,\nmaybe we can catch it, we didn't.\n\n244\n00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.110\nIt actually expired immediately.\n\n245\n00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.650\nSo it deleted itself.\n\n246\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.790\nSo, let's see, yep.\n\n247\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.410\nCan't get it to work.\n\n248\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.020\nNow how can I circumvent this.\n\n249\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:45.891\nLet's just say var, newdate, and\n\n250\n00:14:45.891 --> 00:14:51.495\ndateset date date get\ndate JavaScript date sir.\n\n251\n00:14:51.495 --> 00:14:53.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Feels like\na good time had by all.\n\n252\n00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.624\n&gt;&gt; So now I have the date object and\nit should be for Monday.\n\n253\n00:14:58.624 --> 00:15:02.902\nSo I'm gonna do exactly the same thing but\ninstead of using that new date,\n\n254\n00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:07.111\nnew date object, I'm gonna use\nthe variable that I have manipulated and\n\n255\n00:15:07.111 --> 00:15:09.193\nnotice it should expire on Monday.\n\n256\n00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:14.360\nHopefully there it is, and notice it\nhas an expiration date for the future.\n\n257\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:20.513\nOnce Monday comes around at that specific\ntime, around about 10 AM, Eastern time,\n\n258\n00:15:20.513 --> 00:15:26.050\nboom, that cookie will delete,\nget rid of itself, it's gone forever.\n\n259\n00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.330\nThat is one of those ways\nwhen you click remember me,\n\n260\n00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.340\nI'm gonna start with a username and\n\n261\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.790\nmaybe a token, kinda like that backstage\npass you may get at certain events, that\n\n262\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.270\nlet you come back to the website without\ntyping your username and password again.\n\n263\n00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.182\nAfter a certain amount of time,\nthat cookie will delete.\n\n264\n00:15:43.182 --> 00:15:44.141\nIt's gone.\n\n265\n00:15:44.141 --> 00:15:46.394\n[NOISE] No more.\n\n266\n00:15:46.394 --> 00:15:49.981\nYou have to re-log in and\nthen it'll store another cookie.\n\n267\n00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:51.895\n&gt;&gt; This is one of my favorite\nfeatures of websites,\n\n268\n00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:54.280\nactually, because I like\nto break into them.\n\n269\n00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.380\nSo when you steal somebody else's cookie,\ntheir little session ID that you might jam\n\n270\n00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:04.470\nin there and then add it to your own,\npump that, and basically, dynamically\n\n271\n00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:09.920\nupdate that site to say, there they are,\nthat's their ID, that goes with this user.\n\n272\n00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.690\nI can now just log in as long\nas the session doesn't expire,\n\n273\n00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.710\nI have access to whatever\nthat user has access to.\n\n274\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.569\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nthat is one of the concerns about cookies.\n\n275\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.680\nI do have some security issues.\n\n276\n00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.770\nIf people store incorrect things or\nthey're not handling session tokens.\n\n277\n00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.890\nAnd what we mean by session\ntokens is when you log in,\n\n278\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:33.580\nyou're essentially getting the thumbs up\nto gain access to a guarded website and\n\n279\n00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.739\nit will issue you a temporary pass\nlike a wrist band so to speak.\n\n280\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.050\nIf I can steal that wristband\nwithout tampering with it and\n\n281\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.610\nput it on my wrist then\nI can walk back in.\n\n282\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.910\nWell if it's stored in\na cookie insecurely and\n\n283\n00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.650\nI'm not handling it by any other means,\ncookies on your machine may give other\n\n284\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:57.030\npeople access to your accounts if\nthey can grab ahold of those cookies.\n\n285\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.550\nNow that is actually a security issue\nregardless of what information you store\n\n286\n00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.790\nbut cookies tend to be plain text,\nin your face.\n\n287\n00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.630\nI can just point and\nclick and go, there you go.\n\n288\n00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.410\nThere you go.\n\n289\n00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:12.090\nSo do keep that in mind,\nI can deny used cookies, but\n\n290\n00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:17.370\nwhat are the other storage\nmedia that come to play?\n\n291\n00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.150\nWell while we're on the screen,\nlet's take a look here\n\n292\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:25.680\non the screen where in this application\nportion I have the storage.\n\n293\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.710\nWhen I see the storage.\n\n294\n00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:31.350\nI have local storage,\nsession storage, index DB.\n\n295\n00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.950\nDB, that's weird.\n\n296\n00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:33.450\nDatabase?\n\n297\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.620\nThat's crazy Daniel.\n\n298\n00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.500\nWeb SQL also more database talk and\nthen we've already seen cookies.\n\n299\n00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.580\nAnd I'm sure you've seen this.\n\n300\n00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.140\nWe are actually going to talk\nabout local storage mostly.\n\n301\n00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.450\nI use local storage a fair\namount just to play around with.\n\n302\n00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.679\nAgain you may have valid security concerns\nif you're storing things inappropriately.\n\n303\n00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.850\nSession Storage,\nlet's look at what's in Session Storage.\n\n304\n00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.640\nI have no idea what any of this is, right?\n\n305\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.550\n&gt;&gt; That's session storage.\n\n306\n00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.570\n&gt;&gt; It's session storage.\n\n307\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.870\nThanks Daniel, I'm-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, glad I could be there for you.\n\n308\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.340\n&gt;&gt; You're right, I was amiss.\n\n309\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.880\nSo okay, what it helps at storing,\nI don't know.\n\n310\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.740\nIndexDB, what is that?\n\n311\n00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.470\nWell we're actually gonna\ntalk about IndexDB.\n\n312\n00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:23.130\nAlso web SQL I will tell you this has\nbeen deprecated as a standard for\n\n313\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:28.940\nWC3 which is kind of the standards body\nfor web application type technologies.\n\n314\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:34.940\nThis was around and provided a SQL\nlike interface to browser storage,\n\n315\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.730\nwith limitations.\n\n316\n00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:42.510\nIt slowly got pushed to\nthe wayside in favor of IndexedDB.\n\n317\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:49.060\nNow we will talk about IndexedDB,\nbut not in super amounts of detail.\n\n318\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.820\nCuz it tends to be way more complicated\nthan most used cases have to do with.\n\n319\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.740\nAs a matter of fact, a lot of times in the\ndocumentation when you're reading about\n\n320\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.250\nIndexedDB, there like go\nuse these three libraries\n\n321\n00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.490\nthat make this simpler because\nthis is more difficult.\n\n322\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.740\nBut you know Daniel, I know we really\nneed to dive in here and see how local\n\n323\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.690\nstorage and index DB work, but I'm not\nsure that we have time in this episode.\n\n324\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the time clock over there\nis fleeting that is for sure, but\n\n325\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.000\nthe great thing is we can just create a\npart two, so that's exactly what we'll do.\n\n326\n00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.620\nJustin I'm looking forward\nto seeing you there and\n\n327\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.860\ncontinuing this conversation\nabout storage in the browser.\n\n328\n00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.320\nHopefully you'll join us there as well,\n\n329\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.630\nround out your knowledge\non that very topic.\n\n330\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.335\nBut like Justin says, looking at the\nclock, it's about that time to sign off\n\n331\n00:19:32.335 --> 00:19:34.793\nfor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n332\n00:19:34.793 --> 00:19:35.965\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n333\n00:19:35.965 --> 00:19:37.939\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n334\n00:19:37.939 --> 00:19:43.930\n[MUSIC]\n\n335\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.728\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:16.610\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.790\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.010\nwe're continuing all of more on our\nintro to web development series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.260\nAnd of course joining us back in\nthe studio yet again to continue our\n\n10\n00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.440\nconversation on storage in the browser\nour good friend mister Justin Dennison.\n\n11\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.320\nJustin welcome back man how's it going.\n\n12\n00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170\n&gt;&gt; It's going well thanks for\nhaving me back Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.920\nHow are you today?\n\n14\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.220\n&gt;&gt; I can not complain thank you sir.\n\n15\n00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.190\n&gt;&gt; That's always good to\nhear always good to hear.\n\n16\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.340\nSo yeah storage in the browser,\nlast time we talked about\n\n17\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.180\ncookies if you haven't seen that\nepisode definitely go check it out.\n\n18\n00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.380\nCookies are an interesting thing.\n\n19\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.990\nThough they sound delicious they're\nnot the easiest to work with,\n\n20\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.910\nthey don't make a lot of\nsense programmatically.\n\n21\n00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.400\nThey are actually just stored kind of like\na long string and you gotta parse it.\n\n22\n00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.120\nI just thought about that and need a nap.\n\n23\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.340\nSo that's not the only way we can\nstore information in the browser.\n\n24\n00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.580\nWe're actually gonna talk about two ways.\n\n25\n00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.480\nWe're gonna see one a little more\nin depth called local storage and\n\n26\n00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.740\nthen we're also gonna look at index DB.\n\n27\n00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.200\nWe're gonna look into the documentation,\nsee some of the examples, but\n\n28\n00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.360\nwe're not gonna do a lot of interaction\nwith the actual index DB raw API.\n\n29\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.910\nBut I will take a look at\nokay what does this involve,\n\n30\n00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.910\nwhat is this available to me.\n\n31\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.038\nCuz it's always good to know.\n\n32\n00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:28.852\nMaybe you need to build a giant project\nand you didn't know about index DB,\n\n33\n00:01:28.852 --> 00:01:29.699\nindexed DB.\n\n34\n00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:31.450\nI tend to leave that ED off there.\n\n35\n00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.180\nSo we always need to have\nall the information at hand.\n\n36\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.150\nSo I think the first thing we need to\ndo is actually let's just go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.210\njump into the browser and\nlet's look at this local storage thing.\n\n38\n00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.380\nThe first thing we're gonna do\nis actually go to local storage,\n\n39\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.070\nMozilla developer network.\n\n40\n00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.150\nSo that's all I typed,\nlocalstorage mozilla developer network and\n\n41\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.070\nnotice it says local storage,\nlocal storage so there's two of these.\n\n42\n00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.290\nI wonder which one I should pick.\n\n43\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.080\nWell, I'm actually gonna start\nwith this first link cuz\n\n44\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.610\npart of being a developer is okay, well\nI know where to find the information but\n\n45\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.400\nI gotta be able to zip\nthrough the information.\n\n46\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.020\nSo, this one is actually not really\nhelpful, and I've look at this before,\n\n47\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.990\nit's just a general overview, that's nice,\nwell this isn't helpful to me.\n\n48\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.670\nSo, when that happens, hit back,\nbut if you go to the next one,\n\n49\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.030\nLocalStorage Web APIs, you actually\nget a little more available to you.\n\n50\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.190\nSo it actually defines local storage and\ncreates local storage from scratch, but\n\n51\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.600\nit does give you some\ninteresting things here.\n\n52\n00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.950\nThe maximum size of data that can be\nsaved is severely restricted by the use\n\n53\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.860\nof cookies.\n\n54\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.110\nWith this algorithm use\nthe functions local storage,\n\n55\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.570\nset item and remove item to change or\nremove a key.\n\n56\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.930\nThe use of local storage dot\nyour key equals your value and\n\n57\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.450\ndelete your key is not a secure way.\n\n58\n00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.280\nNow I'm going to actually cover this way,\nbut\n\n59\n00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.380\nnotice it says this is not secure,\nyou shouldn't do this.\n\n60\n00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.530\nI'm going to show you just so\nyou'll know this will work.\n\n61\n00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.610\nBut that doesn't mean that\nit's a good way, right?\n\n62\n00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.480\nJust because you can\ndoesn't mean you should.\n\n63\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.600\n&gt;&gt; As tempting as it may\nbe to do that very thing.\n\n64\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly,\nyou'd be like, it's just easy.\n\n65\n00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.350\nBe careful.\n\n66\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.660\nNow this is giving you, actually, behind\nthe scenes, if I wanted to take this and\n\n67\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.850\ncopy and paste it, and put it in a file,\nand put it in my web app.\n\n68\n00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.780\nEven if local storage is not in\nthe browser I would then have local\n\n69\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.770\nstorage available to me,\nthis is the entire implementation.\n\n70\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.270\nWell, the entire implementation.\n\n71\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.700\nIt is an implementation of\nthe local storage construct.\n\n72\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.600\nNow okay well that gives\nme some good ideas here but\n\n73\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.240\nI still need, how does this work?\n\n74\n00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.250\nWell I'm having trouble figuring this out.\n\n75\n00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.370\nI did see where I can\ntype Window.localStorage\n\n76\n00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.370\nwhen reading through these files,\nor through this documentation.\n\n77\n00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.460\nSo I wanna go start inspecting,\nas we always do, right?\n\n78\n00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.610\nWe start trekking around,\nlooking around, looking for clues.\n\n79\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.280\nSo I'm gonna leave this window open.\n\n80\n00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.550\nBut I'm gonna open Chrome Dev Tools and\nactually go to the console.\n\n81\n00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.580\nSo I used a keyboard shortcut, chrome dev\ntools are under the little dot dot dot.\n\n82\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.540\nMore tools, developer tools.\n\n83\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.419\nSo in the console,\nI'm gonna say window, local storage.\n\n84\n00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.170\nNow window.localstorage notice\n\n85\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.759\nthis does not say local storage but\nin fact says hey this is a storage thing.\n\n86\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.240\nOkay, well, that gives me a hint,\nit gives me an idea.\n\n87\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.130\nIf I look back, hey, there's this storage\nthing actually in the documentation.\n\n88\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.990\nLet me do some more research here,\nI'm going to drop this down and\n\n89\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.819\nnotice it says,\nthis is a storage type thing.\n\n90\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.650\nWhen the other local storage\ndocumentation, these first two,\n\n91\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.630\nit just showed me some kind of high\nlevel overview in the first one.\n\n92\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.180\nAnd then in the second one it says,\nif you need local storage and\n\n93\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.020\nyour browser doesn't have it, write this.\n\n94\n00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.770\nWell I actually wanna know how to use it.\n\n95\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.500\nWhat are some examples?\n\n96\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.450\nWhat is it available for?\n\n97\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.520\nWhat are the nuanced details?\n\n98\n00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.120\nIf I click on Storage,\nnow I start to see familiar documentation.\n\n99\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.130\nI have Properties, I have Methods.\n\n100\n00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.320\nI have examples of how to use it.\n\n101\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.890\nThere we go.\n\n102\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.380\nNow this is one of the biggest issues that\ncome up with some of these storage media,\n\n103\n00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.500\nis things start to circle or\nthey point to other things.\n\n104\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.160\nI need to know about local storage.\n\n105\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.210\nWell that's good, here's some\ninformation about local storage.\n\n106\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.130\nWell, that is the answer to my question.\n\n107\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.530\nYou actually wanna go look at storage, but\n\n108\n00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.570\nhow am I supposed to know that\nlocalStorage is a type of storage?\n\n109\n00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.620\nSo, you need to go look at storage.\n\n110\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.340\nAnd part of that is being resourceful and\n\n111\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.190\nstarting to look for\nclues inside of your browser console.\n\n112\n00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.570\nI'm a big proponent of when in doubt,\njust start poking around at the keyboard.\n\n113\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.510\nIt's actually a lot harder to break\na computer than some people may think so\n\n114\n00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.740\ndon't be afraid.\n\n115\n00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.210\nMove fast, break it, fix it,\nfigure it out, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.190\nSo, Window local storage\nis available to me.\n\n117\n00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.620\nI'm gonna leave this documentation\n\n118\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.550\nopen because we're gonna\nreference back to that.\n\n119\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.660\nBut because it's on a window object I can\nactually just type a local storage without\n\n120\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.150\nthat window dot thing all the time.\n\n121\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.060\nSo I now have access in the global scope,\neverywhere in the browser.\n\n122\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.450\nIf I type local storage,\nit refers to this storage item.\n\n123\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.340\nAt current time, I have nothing here.\n\n124\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.910\nBut what if I, on this exact same page,\nI'm gonna open Chrome dev tools, just for\n\n125\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.580\na moment and type localStorage,\nit says nothing here.\n\n126\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.717\nOkay, let's try one more page.\n\n127\n00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:48.060\nGoogle.com, open Chrome Dev Tools and\ntype localStorage.\n\n128\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.440\nThere is actually a bunch of stuff in\nthere and that's because Google is using\n\n129\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.930\nsome local storage key value pairs\nin order to store information.\n\n130\n00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.360\nI don't really know what these are.\n\n131\n00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.060\nNot gonna lie to you.\n\n132\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.010\nI'm sure it has something to do with tabs.\n\n133\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.390\nThat's all I got.\n\n134\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.260\nBut this is for the Google site.\n\n135\n00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.330\nNow I will also tell you this,\nsome of these are, that is really long.\n\n136\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.360\n&gt;&gt; That is a lot of data.\n\n137\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.930\n&gt;&gt; That is a lot of data.\n\n138\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.610\nSome of these will actually\ntake a little bit to persist.\n\n139\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.750\nThere are times I have navigated to\nGoogle, playing around with local storage,\n\n140\n00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.140\njust to poke around, because I knew\nthere was stuff in local storage.\n\n141\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.840\nAnd there wasn't anything there.\n\n142\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.590\nAnd I was like, that's kinda weird and\nthen I got distracted and\n\n143\n00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.330\nlooked at other things and came back and\nthen there were things in local storage.\n\n144\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.030\nSo some of these are asynchronous, they'll\nkind of load and get stored over time.\n\n145\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.530\nSo they may not be immediately there, so\n\n146\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.630\nif you're not seeing\nthem just wait longer.\n\n147\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.436\nNot too long, just so we're, if you're\nlike well it's been 40 minutes and\n\n148\n00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:52.006\nthere's nothing there you should probably\ngo try to find another site that has local\n\n149\n00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:52.727\nstorage usage.\n\n150\n00:07:52.727 --> 00:07:57.899\nso it's good to see here, and compare,\nin this new tab that there is nothing.\n\n151\n00:07:57.899 --> 00:07:59.552\nI have length of zero.\n\n152\n00:07:59.552 --> 00:08:06.720\nOkay well in This tab where Google has set\nfour properties, I have a length of four.\n\n153\n00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.840\nLength in the storage sense is how\nmany pieces of information I have.\n\n154\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.450\nIt is not necessarily organized by order,\nit's just a total count.\n\n155\n00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.760\nYou can think of it as a count\nof things that are available.\n\n156\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.830\nNow, I'm actually going to get away\nfrom the noise with Google and\n\n157\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.050\nlet's actually start putting some things\nin here, look at some of these methods.\n\n158\n00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.140\nSo if I say local storage,\nI can say set, item.\n\n159\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.470\nI need to store something,\nI grab that username, and\n\n160\n00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.658\nI'm going to say username [SOUND].\n\n161\n00:08:43.658 --> 00:08:45.980\nIt's a great user name,\nPeople will have a hard time-\n\n162\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.440\n&gt;&gt; That's my exact user name.\n\n163\n00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.692\n&gt;&gt; Man.\nI'm really good at this.\n\n164\n00:08:49.692 --> 00:08:51.520\n&gt;&gt; Weird [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like what I did\n\n165\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.190\nwas lean on the keyboard and I got it.\n\n166\n00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.980\nSo if I hit that, okay it says undefined.\n\n167\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.050\nBut if I go back and print out\nlocal storage I now have that set\n\n168\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.399\ninside of this storage mechanism.\n\n169\n00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.360\nNotice it is by key value pair.\n\n170\n00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.170\nThis kind of look like an object, and for\n\n171\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.070\nthe most part you can\ntreat it like an object.\n\n172\n00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.060\nI can say localStorage.username and\nget that out.\n\n173\n00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.179\nBut you'll notice in the documentation\nit says no, don't do that.\n\n174\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.780\nI can also update it just like that.\n\n175\n00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.550\nAlso, a wonderful username.\n\n176\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.690\nAnd if I look back at local storage,\nwell it has been updated.\n\n177\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.560\nJust because you can,\ndoesn't mean you should.\n\n178\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.070\nYou should use the method set item to\nupdate information in local storage.\n\n179\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.870\nSo I'm gonna clear this just so\nwe can get back to the top.\n\n180\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.760\nBut I notice you know I actually wanted\nto store a legitimate user name and\n\n181\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.670\nnot just me leaning on the keyboard cuz\nnow I'm starting to do some testing.\n\n182\n00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:05.330\nUser name is already there but if I say\nset item, user name, and to say John.\n\n183\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.350\nThen that will update any\nexisting key value pair.\n\n184\n00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.040\nThis is the key so the look up what\nit goes by in the storage, and\n\n185\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.390\nthe value that you store it to.\n\n186\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.010\nNow I also wanna store John's ID right?\n\n187\n00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.850\nSo his database lookup ID,\n\n188\n00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.110\nyou should probably not do that\nin actuality just so we're clear.\n\n189\n00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.150\nBut let's just say for instance I am.\n\n190\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.900\nI'm just playing around.\n\n191\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.010\nI'm developing.\n\n192\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.450\nI'm seeing what can be done.\n\n193\n00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:43.470\nIf I say, set item,\nuser ID and is an ID of one.\n\n194\n00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.460\nOkay, that looks fine.\n\n195\n00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:51.670\nSo after we set the user ID of 1,\nwell notice something about local storage.\n\n196\n00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.970\nIs it storing the number 1?\n\n197\n00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.690\nIt's actually storing it as a string.\n\n198\n00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.750\nAnd that's kind of weird.\n\n199\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.640\nI didn't want it to do that\ncuz I need that as a number.\n\n200\n00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.620\nMm, maybe we should play\naround a little more.\n\n201\n00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.391\nSo let's actually create a user object.\n\n202\n00:11:04.391 --> 00:11:09.444\n` And\n\n203\n00:11:09.444 --> 00:11:14.603\nbecause I need this data structure for\n\n204\n00:11:14.603 --> 00:11:17.825\na later time and i can say\n\n205\n00:11:17.825 --> 00:11:25.888\nlocalStorage.setItem('userObj',user);\nOkay,\n\n206\n00:11:25.888 --> 00:11:28.155\nlocalStorage.\n\n207\n00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:37.430\nLocalStorage, wow damn,\nI'm uh-oh, I got a problem.\n\n208\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.910\nUser object is an object.\n\n209\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.960\nWell that's just handy,\nthat is not what I expected.\n\n210\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.400\nWhy did it do that?\n\n211\n00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.140\nI stored it,\nI actually need it to be this thing.\n\n212\n00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.940\nWell you know if I go back and look user\nid was suppose to be a number also but\n\n213\n00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.050\nit's a string.\n\n214\n00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.380\nAnd what happens is local\nstorage is limited and\n\n215\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.370\nit's a string to string mapping.\n\n216\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:09.890\nI can get a key that is a string like user\nobject, user id, user name, or I can get.\n\n217\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.420\nExcuse me, and\nthe value has to be a string as well.\n\n218\n00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.820\nSo, how can I get this exact data\nstructure inside of the user object so\n\n219\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.350\nI can grab that out and interact with it?\n\n220\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.890\nSo, this is a little extra bang for\nyour buck.\n\n221\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.190\nSo, I'm going to print out local\nstorage here, just for reference, and\n\n222\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:37.940\nif I print out user, I want this right\nthere as a string representation.\n\n223\n00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:43.700\nThis comes as a specific file format\ncalled JSON, java script object notation.\n\n224\n00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.900\nIt is a string representation\nof this exact object.\n\n225\n00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.680\nIn browsers I actually have\na JavaScript object notation module.\n\n226\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.710\nI have this available everywhere,\nand I can say stringify the user and\n\n227\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:04.750\nnotice I have a more accurate string\nrepresentation of this data structure.\n\n228\n00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.610\nI can combine these now with\nlocal storage to store them.\n\n229\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:16.220\nSo localstorage.setitem the user object\n\n230\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:24.865\nbut instead of just user\nI can say JSON.stringify\n\n231\n00:13:24.865 --> 00:13:30.630\nthe user And\nif I look at localStorage again,\n\n232\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.830\nnotice I don't have this [object,\nObject], that's great.\n\n233\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.610\nBut now I've created another problem for\nmyself.\n\n234\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.260\nHow do I get that back out and\n\n235\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.790\nactually have it behave as\na JavaScript data structure?\n\n236\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.528\nWell, first off,\nhow do I get it back out the right way?\n\n237\n00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:49.820\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] yeah period.\n\n238\n00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:55.003\nSo if I look at local storage I can say,\ngetItem and\n\n239\n00:13:55.003 --> 00:14:00.434\nthat's a look up by name So\nI can pull that back out but\n\n240\n00:14:00.434 --> 00:14:07.486\nnow if I wanted to store that in\na variable I'm gonna say, getItem.\n\n241\n00:14:13.905 --> 00:14:16.060\nAnd it's a string.\n\n242\n00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.900\nI need to do something\ncalled serialization.\n\n243\n00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.420\nI need to parse this out and have it\nturn back into that data structure.\n\n244\n00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.660\nNow, I could spend the next three days\nresearching how to do that by hand\n\n245\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.700\nby going, okay, I need to look for\nall of the left curly braces and\n\n246\n00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.670\nthen go up to the next right curly brace,\nbut I have to pair them.\n\n247\n00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.240\nWell, thay's a lot of work.\n\n248\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.520\nLuckily, if I can string a five json,\nturn it into a string,\n\n249\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.670\nI wonder if there's a method on\nthe json module that does that for me?\n\n250\n00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:52.390\nA lot of people have worked on that, well\nit just so happens that in fact there is.\n\n251\n00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.340\nNow I got to get rid of\nthis let declaration here\n\n252\n00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.760\nbecause it's already defined and\nit will scream at me.\n\n253\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.491\nBut if I say JSON.parse,\n\n254\n00:15:03.491 --> 00:15:10.200\nuser again, and\nnotice I now have a legitimate JavaScript\n\n255\n00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.240\nobject as a data structure that I can\nsay userAgain.name and get the name out.\n\n256\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.450\nI can use it just as I\nhave all the other times.\n\n257\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.850\nWell that's handy to know.\n\n258\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.920\nBut you, that is one of the limitations.\n\n259\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.400\nI only am able to store strings, So\n\n260\n00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:31.300\nI have to make sure I handle that\ndata type conversion Appropriately.\n\n261\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.830\nObject becomes a string and then when I\nget it out I need to take that string and\n\n262\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:36.770\nmake a JSON.\n\n263\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.800\nOr in the case of the user ID,\nif I need it to be a number,\n\n264\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.660\nI need to make sure that it's\na number using parse and\n\n265\n00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:50.141\nparse float the unitary plus operator or\njust a number built in function.\n\n266\n00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:52.868\nSo I can get, I can set, but, you know,\n\n267\n00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:57.130\nbefore people leave I wanna make\nsure to get rid of all of this.\n\n268\n00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:57.662\nAll right.\n\n269\n00:15:57.662 --> 00:15:59.020\nPeople are navigating away from our site.\n\n270\n00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.890\nOn local stores Let me\nactually clear this, just so\n\n271\n00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.940\nwe can not be looking down\nat the bottom of the screen.\n\n272\n00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.145\nThat kinda hurts my neck.\n\n273\n00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:13.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, localStorage.clear(),\n\n274\n00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.990\nwell it looks like it did something,\nit didn’t scream at me.\n\n275\n00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.530\nAnd in fact,\n\n276\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:22.020\nit just kinda, it just takes it all up and\nbundles it up and throws it in the trash.\n\n277\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.550\nWell that's good to know.\n\n278\n00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.800\nI can set items, I can get items.\n\n279\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.230\nBe careful, you can only use strings,\nI can also clear them.\n\n280\n00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.031\nI also have access to the,\n\n281\n00:16:35.388 --> 00:16:40.060\nThe length property which is telling me\nhow many things are in local storage.\n\n282\n00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.570\nAnd just because Google already has these\n\n283\n00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.530\nI can see this just by\nsaying .length cool.\n\n284\n00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.053\nI did illustrate some\nthings you should not do.\n\n285\n00:16:50.053 --> 00:16:55.270\nAnd, let's just make a made\nup one here real quick using.\n\n286\n00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.470\nThese are all the bad ways, bad ways.\n\n287\n00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.560\nDanger, danger, danger.\n\n288\n00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.480\nDon't do this, don't do this,\ndon't do this.\n\n289\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.190\nI'm letting you know these are available\nbecause you may see these in other\n\n290\n00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.180\npeople's code.\n\n291\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.260\nSo, you need to know that they do work and\nwhat they do.\n\n292\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.370\nBut, if you're writing something\nfrom scratch, or you see this and\n\n293\n00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.860\ncan change it, definitely change this.\n\n294\n00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:22.780\nSo localStorage, let's just say\nfaveFood and that is cheese.\n\n295\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.660\nSo, if I type localStorage there it is.\n\n296\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.170\nIt actually works, don't do that,\nbad, it's insecure,\n\n297\n00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.220\nit doesn't do appropriate serialization\nall the time when you do that.\n\n298\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:38.330\nNow, if I wanted to get that I could say\nlocalStorage.faveFood as we have seen.\n\n299\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.925\nBut, what if I wanted to get\nrid of just that one property?\n\n300\n00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:47.490\nLocalStorage, I should use removeItem, and\n\n301\n00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.771\nwe'll see that in just a moment.\n\n302\n00:17:52.432 --> 00:17:58.802\nBut just so we're clear,\ndon't put localTimeData, that faveFood,\n\n303\n00:17:58.802 --> 00:18:03.899\ncuz that's not there we go,\nlocalStorage.faveFood,\n\n304\n00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:09.894\nbut I can use the delete keyword and\nsay localStorage.faveFood.\n\n305\n00:18:09.894 --> 00:18:13.910\nOkay, well what's in localStorage now?\n\n306\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:14.820\nYou have to type it.\n\n307\n00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.150\nWell it's nothing, but\nyou shouldn't do that either.\n\n308\n00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.530\nYou should use these methods.\n\n309\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.450\nWell how would I?\n\n310\n00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.010\nI can clear everything,\nI can set items, I can get items.\n\n311\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.128\nBut how, what if I just want to\nget rid of that username right?\n\n312\n00:18:28.128 --> 00:18:31.390\nPeriodically, I wanna clear out\njust the things that I've stored\n\n313\n00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:36.070\ninstead of clearing all of the\nlocalStorage because in localStorage this\n\n314\n00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:40.580\nmay persist as people move away\nfrom the site, and come back to it.\n\n315\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.940\nI don't wanna accidentally clear\nthings that should still be there.\n\n316\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.082\nSo, how do I handle that?\n\n317\n00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.321\nWell, let's say localStorage.setItem.\n\n318\n00:18:53.722 --> 00:18:54.918\nThere's my Siri button.\n\n319\n00:18:56.834 --> 00:18:58.122\nGet rid of that.\n\n320\n00:18:58.122 --> 00:19:00.295\nAnd let's just put favefood back in there.\n\n321\n00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:10.558\nAnd then,\nI can say removeItem Of faveFood.\n\n322\n00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:16.450\nAnd in fact,\nI've just removed that single item.\n\n323\n00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.030\nIf I go back and set it.\n\n324\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.930\nLook at it.\n\n325\n00:19:22.816 --> 00:19:26.670\nRemove it, look at it again, and\nnotice I'm pulling that off.\n\n326\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.720\nJust that one though,\nI'm not clearing everything.\n\n327\n00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.670\nSo, if there's a bunch of keys in here,\nthey will remain.\n\n328\n00:19:33.252 --> 00:19:36.000\nSo, localStorage is incredibly handy for\n\n329\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.640\nkeeping a hold of little pieces\nof information that you need.\n\n330\n00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.200\nBut, there's actually a third way and\nlet's just take a very high level view and\n\n331\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.840\nlook at some tools that\npeople will proposed to use\n\n332\n00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.050\nincluding the documentation\nto make this a little easier.\n\n333\n00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.630\nSo, let's hop back into the browser.\n\n334\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:57.910\nWe're actually gonna look at\nsome documentation for in fact,\n\n335\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:04.700\nget rid of this console here,\nMozilla Developer Network IndexedDB.\n\n336\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.540\nSo, there's the indexedDB API.\n\n337\n00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.980\nThere's using IndexedDB.\n\n338\n00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.118\nSo, let's look at the API.\n\n339\n00:20:15.118 --> 00:20:21.030\nAnd, okay, I can read more concepts.\n\n340\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.750\nSo, it's taken me to some links,\ninterfaces.\n\n341\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.000\nBut, notice I'm connecting to a database.\n\n342\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.420\nIt actually provides a database\nlike interface within the browser.\n\n343\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.280\nSo, an IDB environment,\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n344\n00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.440\nAn IDB database, so we'll take\na look at this one actually, but\n\n345\n00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.070\nif I scroll down there's a lot of\nthings I'm supposed to click on.\n\n346\n00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.810\nExamples.\n\n347\n00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:50.793\nA powerful ebook so a full blown\napplication, but here's storing images and\n\n348\n00:20:50.793 --> 00:20:53.141\nfiles in Indexed.DB or IndexedDB.\n\n349\n00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:57.418\nThis is an extension of\nthe Mozilla Developer Network\n\n350\n00:20:57.418 --> 00:21:02.359\ndocumentation Called hacks,\nso it's part of Mozilla also,\n\n351\n00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:07.880\nbut these are typically,\nwell here's how I would use this.\n\n352\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.570\nAnd if we look, let me zoom in here.\n\n353\n00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:18.840\nViraQuest is IndexedDB open the data base\nname, and you have to give it a version.\n\n354\n00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.100\nAnd then,\nyou have to register event listeners for\n\n355\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.370\nwhen it actually successfully occurs\nif that's all you wanna handle.\n\n356\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.360\nAnd if you need to upgrade it,\nas well as, on air.\n\n357\n00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.470\nSo, you have to register\nall of these events and\n\n358\n00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.990\nthen this function will run\nwhen that event occurs.\n\n359\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.930\nSo, there's on error, on success.\n\n360\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.300\nWell, that's a lot of work, that's\n\n361\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.280\nI like to local storage thing just for\nsmall pieces of information.\n\n362\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.970\nIndexDB is more of a robust solution for\nvery small web applications.\n\n363\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.678\nMaybe a little more than you anticipate.\n\n364\n00:21:56.678 --> 00:22:02.900\nSo, [COUGH] What is the recommendation for\nthe alternatives?\n\n365\n00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.247\nWell, if we scroll down, see also.\n\n366\n00:22:07.247 --> 00:22:11.500\nSo, at the bottom of IndexedDBs API and\n\n367\n00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.220\nthere's this developer\nnetwork documentation.\n\n368\n00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.890\nIt tells you of using local\nforage which is called\n\n369\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.710\na polyfill providing\na simple name values syntax.\n\n370\n00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:26.480\nIt provides a Local storage like syntax\nfor clients side data storage but\n\n371\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.470\nactually uses IndexedDB in the background.\n\n372\n00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.356\nSo, it's giving you a similar\nlocal storage interface but\n\n373\n00:22:33.356 --> 00:22:35.231\nstoring it in an IndexedDB.\n\n374\n00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:39.043\nA polyfill is something that you're going\nto have to bring in separate to your own\n\n375\n00:22:39.043 --> 00:22:41.400\nweb application and\nthen use it accordingly.\n\n376\n00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.073\nSo, now those are bound together.\n\n377\n00:22:43.073 --> 00:22:46.038\nThere is another one calledDexie.js, and\n\n378\n00:22:46.038 --> 00:22:50.140\nI have played around with this\nis actually, fairly simple.\n\n379\n00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.110\nAnd, their big thing get\nstarted in 30 seconds.\n\n380\n00:22:54.700 --> 00:23:00.120\nBut, you create a new Dexie object,\nwhich has a version.\n\n381\n00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.330\nAnd then a data base name.\n\n382\n00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.130\nAnd then, you just put friends in data, or\n\n383\n00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.050\nexcuse me, you put things in\nthe database accordingly.\n\n384\n00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:11.080\nIt has simplified the IndexedDB interface,\nthe API,\n\n385\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.930\nsubstantially but that does not\nmean that it's trivial in nature.\n\n386\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.090\nSo, those are two that I found\nfun to play around with and\n\n387\n00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.270\nif you really wanna use\nIndexedDB you have a use case.\n\n388\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.770\nYou're building a large\nscale application that needs\n\n389\n00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.440\nI need to at least transaction data,\nI need to look up friends by ID,\n\n390\n00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.670\nI need to keep all of these blog posts\ntogether, and you wanna use IndexedDB.\n\n391\n00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.820\nI would take a look at those two and\neven ZangoDB,\n\n392\n00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.230\nwhich provides a Mongo like interface,\nwhich is similar to the Dexie one.\n\n393\n00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:46.070\nFor index DB, but for the most part we\nwill use local storage for storing as\n\n394\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.950\nlittle bit of tokens, little bit IDs,\nlittle bit user names here and there.\n\n395\n00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.590\nSo, you know Daniel?\n\n396\n00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.090\nThat was a lot on storage.\n\n397\n00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.010\nI didn't know the browser\nwas capable of that.\n\n398\n00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:59.160\nAnd there are so much more but I think\nthat's a little beyond our use case.\n\n399\n00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.420\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, we don't want to give\nthese people too much to chew on, right?.\n\n400\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.660\nNo one is drinking from a firehose.\n\n401\n00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.550\nWe are gonna give you Just what you need\nso that you can get your feet wet and\n\n402\n00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.430\nstart to understand these concepts and\napply them to your environments, as well.\n\n403\n00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.050\nJustin, thanks for\nhelping us soud with that.\n\n404\n00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.284\nIt seems to be a complex topic,\nsomething you could probably get lost in,\n\n405\n00:24:18.284 --> 00:24:20.926\njust following down every\nrabbit trail available.\n\n406\n00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:24.039\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n[LAUGH] It is rabbit holes abound, and I'm\n\n407\n00:24:24.039 --> 00:24:29.132\nnot saying in a half, but I'm might have\nbeen like hey it's been four hours and\n\n408\n00:24:29.132 --> 00:24:35.050\nI've been reading about indexedB and I\nstill don't know quite what I need to do.\n\n409\n00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:36.870\nSo, do be careful on that.\n\n410\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.130\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell words of wisdom from Justin Dennison.\n\n411\n00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.440\nKeep them in mind.\n\n412\n00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.230\nThat being said, it looks like we have\ncome to the end of another episode.\n\n413\n00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.670\nHopefully you guys enjoyed it.\n\n414\n00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.380\nBut time to sign off at ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n415\n00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.170\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n416\n00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.044\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n417\n00:24:51.044

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:08.193\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.193 --> 00:00:11.482\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.397\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.397 --> 00:00:16.700\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.090\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n9\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.130\nin today's episode we are back with\nmore on our intro to web development.\n\n10\n00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.640\nAnd today joining us in the studio,\n\n11\n00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.180\nto continue us down that path, our good\nfriend and mentor Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n12\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.750\nJustin, welcome back man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.550\n&gt;&gt; It's going well,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.230\nHow are you today Daniel?\n\n15\n00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.620\n&gt;&gt; Its going great, thanks for asking.\n\n16\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.500\n&gt;&gt; All right, that's always good to hear,\ngood to hear.\n\n17\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.810\nWe've actually been kind of making our\nway into the path of web development.\n\n18\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.750\nWe've set up some introduction to ideas\nand concepts that are good to know,\n\n19\n00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.980\nif you haven't checked those out,\nI would definitely go check those out now.\n\n20\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.720\nLet's hit the assumptions here.\n\n21\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.200\nWe know what the DOM is,\nwe have our browser installed,\n\n22\n00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.620\nwe have our text editor installed,\nwe're good to go.\n\n23\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.030\nWe know a little bit about HTML,\na little bit about CSS, and\n\n24\n00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.050\na little bit about JavaScript.\n\n25\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.810\nThose are a lot of requirements but\nthat's kind of all the pieces\n\n26\n00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.220\nthat we have to put together in order\nto build very simple applications.\n\n27\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.570\nSo this one's gonna be\na little bit different.\n\n28\n00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.815\nWe're actually going to\nbuild something together.\n\n29\n00:01:13.815 --> 00:01:16.350\nAnd try to reason through it and\n\n30\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.990\nI'm gonna be very specific about\nwhat is my thought process.\n\n31\n00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.345\nWhy am I doing this at all points in time?\n\n32\n00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:24.880\nAs best I can.\n\n33\n00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.651\nI'm not saying that I'm perfect,\nso the best I can.\n\n34\n00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:30.470\nAnd we're gonna built something simple,\nwhat are we gonna built?\n\n35\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.650\nIt's kind of like a little tally marker,\nall right?\n\n36\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.920\nI'm gonna count up, up,\nover counting, I'm gonna count down.\n\n37\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.360\nI'm gonna count backwards and\nforwards, very, very simple.\n\n38\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.480\nBut it is going to be a single web\napplication that uses JavaScript for\n\n39\n00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.630\ninteractivity.\n\n40\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.490\nAnd we're gonna start by\nnot making it pretty.\n\n41\n00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.680\nBecause one of the things\nthat I have found,\n\n42\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.300\npeople get discouraged is\nthey'll see a finished product.\n\n43\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.080\nAnd they're like well look how\nnice it looks, it's gorgeous.\n\n44\n00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.620\nAnd they kind of get blinded of\n\n45\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.070\nwell there's all these other\nthings it does as well.\n\n46\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.730\nBut the pretty, how it looks is where\nI'm really spending my focus and\n\n47\n00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:14.770\nyour first web applications may not be,\nblow your mind crazy designs.\n\n48\n00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.130\nThe goal is about learning, so\n\n49\n00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.720\nwe're actually gonna start with,\nthis looks pretty bad.\n\n50\n00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.480\nBut it's gonna work and\n\n51\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.270\nour goal is to make it work and\nprovide the behavior that we want.\n\n52\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.410\nSo, I think the best thing to do is go\nahead and hop down into our browser.\n\n53\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.310\nSo our browser,\nthis is where all the fun's gonna happen.\n\n54\n00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.170\nBut before we can use our browser,\nwe actually need to setup our project.\n\n55\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.410\nSo I'm gonna hop into my desktop.\n\n56\n00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.220\nAnd I'm gonna create a new folder and\njust call it Counter.\n\n57\n00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.120\nWithin that folder,\nI'm gonna put my files but\n\n58\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.340\nwe're gonna use our text\neditor to build those.\n\n59\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.200\nSo now I'm gonna hop over into Atom, which\nrich text editors are great for this,\n\n60\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.580\nthey're going to help us a lot, and\nit will reduce the time in development.\n\n61\n00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.830\nYou can always use text edit,\n\n62\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.810\nNotepad, Vim, Nano, anything you like.\n\n63\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.520\nAll of this will still work as long as\nyou're gonna open it up in a browser.\n\n64\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.810\nSo, I'm going to add a project folder and\n\n65\n00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.930\nthe project folder is gonna\nbe that Counter folder.\n\n66\n00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.700\nIt's gonna be empty but\nit won't be for long.\n\n67\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.252\nSo, let's go ahead and start by adding\na new file called index.html and\n\n68\n00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:29.290\nthat's a convention that we're gonna use.\n\n69\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.351\nWe'll use that for all of our projects\nthat we build because that's convention\n\n70\n00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:34.094\nthat's been around for\na great deal of time.\n\n71\n00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:39.960\nAnd we're actually going to make\nanother file called app.js.\n\n72\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.445\nThat's where all of our interactivity,\nall of our information, all of our data,\n\n73\n00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:48.260\npretty much all of [LAUGH] everything\nthat happens is gonna go in this file.\n\n74\n00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.760\nNow, in the grand scheme of things, that\nmay not scale well if I needed a bunch of,\n\n75\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.650\nif I wanted to build a social media\nsite it's not gonna be in a single file.\n\n76\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.600\nSo keep that in mind and we will see.\n\n77\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.120\nI'm gonna build it first of\nI'm just gonna get it to work.\n\n78\n00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.660\nBut then we're gonna revisit it and\n\n79\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.490\nactually go through the thought process\nof how do I make this more maintainable?\n\n80\n00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.460\nHow do I make this easier to\ntransport between projects?\n\n81\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.070\nHow do I make this mobile and modular.\n\n82\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.230\nNot mobile in the sense of mobile devices,\nbut I can move it and\n\n83\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.080\nI don't have to worry about things\nbreaking and me spending the next four\n\n84\n00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.440\nyears going, well you know,\nif I, no, that's not gonna work.\n\n85\n00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.180\nMaybe I'm being a little\nhyperbolic about that, but\n\n86\n00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.650\nthere are times where it seems that way.\n\n87\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.430\nSo, I have these two files open.\n\n88\n00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.885\nLet's go ahead and open our index.\n\n89\n00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:38.520\nhtml and our Google Chrome.\n\n90\n00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.950\nSo, I'm going to open the file and\nlook at our Counter.\n\n91\n00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.690\nOpen index.html It's good,\nit's good, it's good.\n\n92\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.620\nNow I'm gonna open the dev tools.\n\n93\n00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.250\nI like to keep the dev tools open while\nI'm developing just because if something\n\n94\n00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.420\ngoes horribly awry in my JavaScript,\nI'm not sitting here going,\n\n95\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.890\nwell it's not working, so\nwonder what's going on?\n\n96\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.200\nIf I have my dev tools when I refresh,\nif I have a syntax error or\n\n97\n00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.910\nsomething like that I\nget immediate feedback.\n\n98\n00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.810\nAlso, notice that this view area\nis kind of like a mobile device.\n\n99\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.210\nSo if I wanted to make this website\naccessible to mobile devices,\n\n100\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.700\nthis is not strictly going\nto provide us everything.\n\n101\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.670\nBut it would give us an idea of what\nit would look like on a mobile device.\n\n102\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.050\nAnd if we do go into some\nstyling features, right?\n\n103\n00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.950\nI wanna make the buttons\na little prettier.\n\n104\n00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.690\nI wanna make the out\nput a little prettier,\n\n105\n00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.430\nthen I can target a mobile device first.\n\n106\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.060\nThere are more robust tools about\ntargeting certain device sizes and\n\n107\n00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.200\nwe will get into those.\n\n108\n00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.970\nBut again the goal is to\nmake this functional and\n\n109\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.970\nsee how all these pieces fit together.\n\n110\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.780\nSo the first thing I\nfocus on is the layout,\n\n111\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.200\nthe mark up, the bones so to speak, right?\n\n112\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.200\nSo I'm building a house,\nthis is our foundation.\n\n113\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.560\nSo I'm going to start with HTML and\n\n114\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.830\nthere's gonna be some things here that,\nhm, that's kind of weird.\n\n115\n00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.320\nAnd you'll see in just a moment.\n\n116\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.350\nSo if I type HTML, and\nI hit enter not tab but enter, Atom\n\n117\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.810\nhas a built in snip it that will actually\nauto compete for a basic HTML 5 document.\n\n118\n00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.380\nAnd in the title,\nI'm just gonna say Counter, and\n\n119\n00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:29.010\nI do want to make sure that my\nJavaScript is inside of this HTML file.\n\n120\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.780\nSo add.js and there it is.\n\n121\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.190\nAnd before I worry about\nall of my log here,\n\n122\n00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.920\nI'm just going to click\nconsole.log working.\n\n123\n00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.378\nAnd make sure that's hooked up.\n\n124\n00:06:40.378 --> 00:06:43.890\nSo our add.js is working.\n\n125\n00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.530\nIf I see a print out of working.\n\n126\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.520\nSo it's hooked up in the index.html and\nthat way we now have an index.html and\n\n127\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.974\nHTML file, that it's gonna\nrepresent how things look, and\n\n128\n00:06:54.974 --> 00:06:59.970\nour add.js which is how they behave right\nall our information, our interactions,\n\n129\n00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.990\nour data it's gonna live there.\n\n130\n00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.160\nNow within the body, I need to build\nthe foundation for the lay out of my app.\n\n131\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.610\nAnd part of that is I'm gonna\ncreate a div with an ID.\n\n132\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.090\nSo I could create the div,\ncome back and create the ID.\n\n133\n00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.980\nBut with Atom there\nare shortcuts that help us.\n\n134\n00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:26.250\nIf I put # and say div#app and hit Tab,\nI'm hitting Tab with my left finger.\n\n135\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.730\nThen I get an auto complete which\nsaves a great little of time\n\n136\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.660\nduring web development or\nactually any kind of development,\n\n137\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.160\nif you know shortcuts for\nyour respective language.\n\n138\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.947\nSo, within that this my entire\napplication is going to be in this div,\n\n139\n00:07:40.947 --> 00:07:45.492\nnow the reason I have this built like\nthis is I wanna be able to either\n\n140\n00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:49.730\nreproduce it or just grab this\nchunk to put it somewhere else.\n\n141\n00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.349\nI don't have to peel layers apart and\n\n142\n00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:56.110\ndecouple if I wanted to\nadd other things below it.\n\n143\n00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.405\nLike paragraph text and things like that.\n\n144\n00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:00.176\nSo I'm segmenting this,\n\n145\n00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:05.254\nI'm dividing it up from the rest by\nputting it in a div with a particular id.\n\n146\n00:08:05.254 --> 00:08:08.100\nAnd I'm just calling that id of app.\n\n147\n00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.950\nI could call that anything.\n\n148\n00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.010\nThere's nothing special\nabout the word app.\n\n149\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.860\nIt can be anything.\n\n150\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.317\nI've just chosen that.\n\n151\n00:08:13.317 --> 00:08:15.980\nSo, if you wanted to,\nyou could call it counter.\n\n152\n00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.110\nYou could call it cheeseburger,\nbacon, strawberry jelly.\n\n153\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.307\n&gt;&gt; That's my favorite one to call them,\nstrawberry jelly.\n\n154\n00:08:21.307 --> 00:08:22.526\n&gt;&gt; Strawberry jelly.\n\n155\n00:08:22.526 --> 00:08:25.282\nOr I heard that there is candied bacon.\n\n156\n00:08:25.282 --> 00:08:25.894\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n\n157\n00:08:25.894 --> 00:08:28.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it blows my mind.\n\n158\n00:08:28.078 --> 00:08:31.026\nBut back to our application,\nback to our application.\n\n159\n00:08:31.026 --> 00:08:32.199\n&gt;&gt; You'd think we have a hangup for food.\n\n160\n00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:33.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do, we do, we do.\n\n161\n00:08:33.817 --> 00:08:36.130\nSo I need a couple of things.\n\n162\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.720\nIn my counter,\nI'm thinking of it in my head.\n\n163\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.880\nI want a button that has a plus sign,\na button that has a minus sign.\n\n164\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.850\nSo up and down, right.\n\n165\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.392\nI'm going to count up and\nI'm going to count down.\n\n166\n00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:48.900\nAnd then I have a display, right.\n\n167\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.110\nI have an output field.\n\n168\n00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.330\nSo the first thing I want to put on\nhere is a button with a class of button.\n\n169\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.040\nAnd this'll come in later,\nthis may be for some styling.\n\n170\n00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.728\nSo I'm trying to think ahead a little bit.\n\n171\n00:09:00.728 --> 00:09:08.040\nAnd not a class of, not a class,\nbut an id of increase, all right?\n\n172\n00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.860\nSo I added a class of button.\n\n173\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.750\nNow, I could have called\nthis a range of things.\n\n174\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.980\nThere's nothing special about this.\n\n175\n00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.805\nI could have said btn.\n\n176\n00:09:14.805 --> 00:09:18.860\nI've just chosen that because I wanna use\nthis as a styling mechanism later, so\n\n177\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.129\nthat I can just say,\n\n178\n00:09:20.129 --> 00:09:23.960\nI want all the class things that have\nbuttons on them to be styled like this.\n\n179\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.840\nAnd then I give an ID of increase, and\nthat's to remind me I've picked that ID,\n\n180\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.520\nbecause this is going\nto be the plus button.\n\n181\n00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.440\nThis is what's gonna make things go up.\n\n182\n00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.420\nOkay, so what about the next field?\n\n183\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:43.310\nWell, I kinda want a plus and\nthen a display.\n\n184\n00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:50.030\nAnd I want the display to somehow\nseparate the count up and the count down.\n\n185\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.969\n&gt;&gt; Is that a purely design element,\n\n186\n00:09:51.969 --> 00:09:55.372\nit's not necessarily that you\nhave to do it that way, or?\n\n187\n00:09:55.372 --> 00:09:58.570\n&gt;&gt; Right, I can arrange these\nin any way that I want to,\n\n188\n00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.080\nas long as they're kind of\ngrouped together in this div.\n\n189\n00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.850\nThere's nothing special\nabout this arrangement.\n\n190\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.300\nThat's a great question.\n\n191\n00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.800\nThere's nothing special about this\narrangement other than what kind of makes\n\n192\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.225\nsense to me, what helps me reason\nthrough how things are going to work.\n\n193\n00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:16.000\nI like to have that separation,\n\n194\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.560\nbecause I don't want the buttons\nkind of smashed together.\n\n195\n00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.309\nSo, because if I'm testing, right,\nI'm clicking one versus the other,\n\n196\n00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:26.124\nI want to make sure that I'm\nclicking only the plus button and\n\n197\n00:10:26.124 --> 00:10:29.840\nI'm not getting weird side effects\nbecause they're smashed right together.\n\n198\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.440\nAnd I've been playing with CSS styling,\nand actually the targets,\n\n199\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.740\nthe event target areas are overlapping,\nso I get weird stuff.\n\n200\n00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.200\nSo I'm making sure they're separate\njust for ease of use for me.\n\n201\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:48.820\nSo within this div area, I'm actually\ngoing to give this an id of display.\n\n202\n00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.370\nSo notice there's nothing in there.\n\n203\n00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.385\nI don't need anything in there right now.\n\n204\n00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:57.200\nIt's just a way to put that information.\n\n205\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.220\nNow, when I build web applications, I used\nto hard code a great deal of things in\n\n206\n00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.980\nthe HTML, grab them out,\nmanipulate them, and put them back.\n\n207\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.455\nBut I have since learned,\nfrom a maintainability standpoint,\n\n208\n00:11:09.455 --> 00:11:11.545\nthat's not the easiest way.\n\n209\n00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:12.990\nIt's not the most intuitive.\n\n210\n00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.870\nSometimes there's no way around it.\n\n211\n00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.660\nNot gonna lie to you.\n\n212\n00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.970\nYou're like, I really need to store\nthat in the HTML as a static 0 or\n\n213\n00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.310\nABCD or name, and if just has to be there.\n\n214\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:30.470\nBut there's other times where keeping that\nin what's called the view or the rendered\n\n215\n00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:35.570\nout HTML, it makes it more difficult cuz\nI got to grab it, use it, put it back.\n\n216\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.730\nGrab it, use it, put it back.\n\n217\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.218\nIt would almost be nice if I can just do\nall my manipulations in my JavaScript and\n\n218\n00:11:41.218 --> 00:11:43.190\nthen just put it there.\n\n219\n00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.540\nSo that's what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna take that approach.\n\n220\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.388\nAnd that's a common approach that you will\nsee if you start looking into the web\n\n221\n00:11:49.388 --> 00:11:52.840\ndevelopment space of like frameworks,\nlike Vue, React, Angular.\n\n222\n00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.020\nWhen I manipulate my data and\nthen put the data into my HTML.\n\n223\n00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.480\nNot get my data out of my HTML,\nmanipulate it, and put it back.\n\n224\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.020\nSo it's a one-way trip\nversus a round trip.\n\n225\n00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.011\nSo which one is shorter?\n\n226\n00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:10.872\nAnd then I'm going to have another\nbutton with also a class of button and\n\n227\n00:12:10.872 --> 00:12:12.660\nan ID of decrease.\n\n228\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.299\nAgain, just to remind me,\nwhat is this button for?\n\n229\n00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:21.100\nAnd if I save, this is actually all of\nthe layout I need for this simple counter.\n\n230\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.750\nI have my entire application\nright here in this div.\n\n231\n00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.640\nNow, it does require this script\ntag to be here, but that's okay.\n\n232\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.540\nLet's go see what that looks like.\n\n233\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:39.200\nAnd if I refresh, you'll notice\nthat it's crazy tiny on my screen,\n\n234\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.900\nbut I'm going to zoom in just so\nwe can have this work for us.\n\n235\n00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.010\nNow, I said that these shouldn't\nbe stacked next to each other.\n\n236\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:56.130\nWell, they won't be when we finally\nput information inside of the div.\n\n237\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.530\nSo we're not quite there.\n\n238\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.305\nSo just a reminder, I put a 0 there.\n\n239\n00:12:59.305 --> 00:12:59.854\nI don't like that.\n\n240\n00:12:59.854 --> 00:13:03.111\nI like taking my data from my JavaScript\nand putting it into the HTML,\n\n241\n00:13:03.111 --> 00:13:07.400\ninstead of putting all my data there,\nhaving to get it out, and put it back in.\n\n242\n00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.750\nSo for now, I've got a really\nstrong four-finger swipe there.\n\n243\n00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.850\nSo if look back,\nthese are stacked next to each other.\n\n244\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.370\nBut they will not be when we start\nactually getting our application working.\n\n245\n00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.930\nSo our HTML layout is done.\n\n246\n00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.230\nNow comes the fun part.\n\n247\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.124\nWe wanna add that interactivity,\nthat I want it to do stuff.\n\n248\n00:13:28.124 --> 00:13:33.880\nBecause as it stands, mm,\nthat, they don't do anything.\n\n249\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.620\n&gt;&gt; Not a lot going on.\n\n250\n00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.590\n&gt;&gt; Not a lot going on.\n\n251\n00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:36.382\n&gt;&gt; On your website there.\n\n252\n00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:40.826\n&gt;&gt; Right, [INAUDIBLE] now I actually got\ntwo buttons, and they don't do anything.\n\n253\n00:13:40.826 --> 00:13:43.134\n&gt;&gt; And the award for dumbest website for\nthe year goes to- [LAUGH]\n\n254\n00:13:43.134 --> 00:13:45.681\n&gt;&gt; Badush.\n\n255\n00:13:45.681 --> 00:13:49.000\nAll right, so let's actually\nget started doing something.\n\n256\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.760\nNow, you're gonna have\nto keep faith with me.\n\n257\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.020\nThere's gonna be some craziness here.\n\n258\n00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:58.530\nAnd also, I'm gonna start using some of\nthese new features in JavaScript that may\n\n259\n00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:03.895\nnot be supported by all browsers, but\nwill help us keep things a little nicer,\n\n260\n00:14:03.895 --> 00:14:07.320\nokay, a little easier to reason about.\n\n261\n00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.390\nAnd also keep us safer.\n\n262\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:16.080\nSo, the way I organize my applications\nif I'm writing them this way is,\n\n263\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:21.670\ndata and variables, and\nthen after that, caching\n\n264\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.590\nor retrieving items from the DOM,\nbecause I do need access to those buttons.\n\n265\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.130\nI've got the querySelector and\nthe getElementById.\n\n266\n00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.300\nI need the ability to interact with those,\nto use those.\n\n267\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.472\nSo caching or\nretrieving references to the DOM.\n\n268\n00:14:41.857 --> 00:14:46.640\nAnd then I'm going to do\nany additional setup.\n\n269\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.544\nAnd then all of my function\ndefinitions that I'm going to use for\n\n270\n00:14:50.544 --> 00:14:53.810\nputting this together\nare going to be the last ones.\n\n271\n00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.540\nI'm going to use named functions so\nthat that function name is\n\n272\n00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.800\nhoisted to the top of the file so\nit's available everywhere.\n\n273\n00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.760\nIf you use other ways to declare\nfunctions than this, you may have to put\n\n274\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.040\nthose somewhere else other than at the\nbottom of the file, so keep that in mind.\n\n275\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.440\nSo that's my layout.\n\n276\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.470\nI actually typically put them just like\nthat, because that's how I write them.\n\n277\n00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.180\nMy data and variables come first,\nmy caching and\n\n278\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.430\nretrieving references\nto the DOM come next.\n\n279\n00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:28.250\nMy setup, which does involve needing\nsome additional functions, comes next.\n\n280\n00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.320\nAnd then I start filling in the functions.\n\n281\n00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.250\nSo let's get some data.\n\n282\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.980\nIf I think about this, what's the only\n\n283\n00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.740\namount of data that I need to keep\ntrack of in order to have a counter?\n\n284\n00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.740\nHm.\n\n285\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.490\nWell, this is not data,\nthis is an interaction.\n\n286\n00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.970\nThis is not data.\n\n287\n00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.108\nBut instead I need to see\nwhat is displayed, right?\n\n288\n00:15:50.108 --> 00:15:51.920\nI actually need to know the count.\n\n289\n00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.472\nAnd if we think about it, when we count\nthings, if we're counting on our fingers,\n\n290\n00:15:56.472 --> 00:15:59.870\nwe're keeping track Of a piece of data,\nnamely, the count.\n\n291\n00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.570\nSo I'm going to keep that piece\nof data as a variable reference.\n\n292\n00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.670\nNow I'm going to use let here because\nI know this is going to change.\n\n293\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.890\nIt's going to mutate as I click plus and\nminus.\n\n294\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.300\nSo I have to allow to mutate.\n\n295\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.970\nI could use var here, but\nI'm using some of these new ES6 or\n\n296\n00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.600\nECMAScript 6 or new JavaScript features\nin order to build this application.\n\n297\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.960\nIf you're using an older browser,\nthese may break a little bit, so\n\n298\n00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.560\nkeep that in mind.\n\n299\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.899\nSo I'm gonna say let count = 0, right.\n\n300\n00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:34.000\nWhen I start counting,\nI have nothing, right.\n\n301\n00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.350\nRight before I start counting, I have not\ncounted anything, so I start at zero.\n\n302\n00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.910\nAnd then next, I'm going to do something.\n\n303\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.600\nWhat is my data?\n\n304\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.857\nI'm gonna say the element for\nmy application is\n\n305\n00:16:49.857 --> 00:16:55.600\ngoing to be referenced by #app,\nthe id of app.\n\n306\n00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.020\nAnd that comes from, notice, everything\ninside of this is where my app resides.\n\n307\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:01.580\nOkay.\n\n308\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.430\nSo I have these two.\n\n309\n00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.760\nBelieve it or not, that's all the\ninformation we need for kind of data and\n\n310\n00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.070\nvariables that need to be\navailable to other places.\n\n311\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:14.360\nSo what's the next part?\n\n312\n00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:18.140\nWell, I wanna cache the DOM and\nI'm gonna use const here.\n\n313\n00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.940\nBecause just like here, I don't want\nthis to accidentally dereference and\n\n314\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.830\nbe pointing to another id.\n\n315\n00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.860\nBecause I get weird behavior if\nI need to use it dynamically.\n\n316\n00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.570\nBut I'm also gonna use const here,\n\n317\n00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:32.750\nbecause once I get a reference to that\nplus button, I want that plus button only.\n\n318\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:37.230\nI don't want it to accidentally become\na string, or some other number, or\n\n319\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.540\na referenced account.\n\n320\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.500\nSo I'm gonna use const,\nso I can't reassign them.\n\n321\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.045\nAnd if I try to do something bad,\nJavaScript's gonna scream at me and\n\n322\n00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:46.687\ngo you can't do that,\ndon't do that, it's bad.\n\n323\n00:17:46.687 --> 00:17:47.480\nWhat do I want?\n\n324\n00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.511\nI want the root element.\n\n325\n00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:53.550\nI'm gonna say document.querySelector.\n\n326\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.550\nAnd what do I mean by the root element?\n\n327\n00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:02.870\nThe root element is what contains\nthe entire application, all of my markup.\n\n328\n00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:08.310\nThis div is the root element for\nmy application.\n\n329\n00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.000\nSo I'm going to keep that and\nthat'll come in more later.\n\n330\n00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.850\nI also want the increaseButton.\n\n331\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.890\nAnd notice, I put the word\nbutton in the variable name.\n\n332\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.630\nCuz if I just use the word increase,\n\n333\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.360\nthat's a little more ambiguous\nthan increase button.\n\n334\n00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.190\nCould I make this shorter and say Btn?\n\n335\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.250\nSure, but I like variable\nnames to mean something to me.\n\n336\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.560\nAnd because of my editor, I don't have as\nmuch issue with longer variable names.\n\n337\n00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.420\nObviously don't make this\nan entire sentence or\n\n338\n00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.024\nlike paragraphs long, but\nhow do I grab a hold of that?\n\n339\n00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:52.020\nWell, I need that id and\nmake sure that you grab the right one.\n\n340\n00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.910\nI'm not saying I have, but there's been\ntimes that I've wired buttons up wrong and\n\n341\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.360\nI click the increase button.\n\n342\n00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.510\nAnd then it counts down and I go well,\nthat's not supposed to work like that.\n\n343\n00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.680\nSo why is that?\n\n344\n00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:09.620\nSo I need the id of increase and\nI need the decrease button.\n\n345\n00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.520\nThat's a lot of typing they're doing.\n\n346\n00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.680\nAnd then what's the last thing?\n\n347\n00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.060\nI need somewhere to put my data, right.\n\n348\n00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.530\nCount is my data,\nI need somewhere to put it.\n\n349\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.320\nWell, that's the display.\n\n350\n00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.720\nSo I need access to the display.\n\n351\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.710\nAnd notice I'm using querySelector,\nnot querySelectorAll\n\n352\n00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.270\nbecause I need just one of these,\nI need the first one on the page.\n\n353\n00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.960\nAnd as a matter of fact, with the ids,\n\n354\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.070\nI should have the id of increase\nonly one time on this page anyway.\n\n355\n00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:57.315\nSo I know that I'm getting\nthat exact button, okay?\n\n356\n00:19:57.315 --> 00:20:01.163\nNow I can't see this yet, so\nmaybe we should print this out and\n\n357\n00:20:01.163 --> 00:20:06.650\nmake sure because the next part is we'll\ninteract with some of these variables.\n\n358\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.380\nAnd if I hadn't actually got what I\nexpected to, things may break and\n\n359\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.170\nit's just gonna take it slow.\n\n360\n00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.910\nMake sure everything is working\nas you create an application\n\n361\n00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.570\ninstead of building everything at once and\nthen go on refreshing [INAUDIBLE].\n\n362\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:25.120\nWell, that is broke and it's real broke\nand I don't even know where to start.\n\n363\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.475\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n364\n00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:29.812\nSo I'm gonna say rootElement,\n\n365\n00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:35.125\ninstead of just printing\nthem kind of side by side,\n\n366\n00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:40.340\nincreaseButton, decreaseButton and\ndisplay.\n\n367\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.040\nNow I will take these out, you don't\nwant this printing out every time.\n\n368\n00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.350\nSo if I come back and refresh.\n\n369\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.140\nOkay, there's my root element,\nthere's my increase button,\n\n370\n00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.240\nthere's my decrease button and\nthere's my display.\n\n371\n00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:58.630\nAnd since I have reference to those\nvariables as const, as constants,\n\n372\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.630\nI know that the display variable will\nalways point to the display element.\n\n373\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.720\nAlso notice, I do not have an undefined\nhere and I wanna highlight something.\n\n374\n00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.965\nThis is a common time where people go,\nI need the thing with the id of decrease.\n\n375\n00:21:14.965 --> 00:21:17.201\nYep, looks good, it looks good.\n\n376\n00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:20.320\nAnd if I refresh, notice I get a null.\n\n377\n00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.179\nWell, that's because I got\na syntax error here technically.\n\n378\n00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.190\nThis is looking for #decrease to look for\nan id and I don't have that, and\n\n379\n00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.020\nif I hadn't checked at this point.\n\n380\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.942\nThe next step is gonna say null does not\nhave the function blah, or null cannot be\n\n381\n00:21:36.942 --> 00:21:41.583\nadded to a number or you're gonna get\n[INAUDIBLE] and all kinds other stuff.\n\n382\n00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:45.720\nSo, what do I want to do for Setup?\n\n383\n00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.050\nWell, I do need the ability to\nclick those buttons, right?\n\n384\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.500\nSo part of my setup is adding\nEventListeners to the respective buttons.\n\n385\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:05.810\nSo addEventListener on click.\n\n386\n00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.200\nNow what do I wanna run?\n\n387\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.786\nIf I have the decrease button and\nI add an eventListener,\n\n388\n00:22:11.786 --> 00:22:14.413\nwell, I don't have anything to run yet.\n\n389\n00:22:14.413 --> 00:22:17.490\nAnd this is where I start bouncing\nbetween the function portion.\n\n390\n00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.204\nI'm gonna create a function called dec for\ndecrease.\n\n391\n00:22:24.204 --> 00:22:25.590\nI'm gonna leave it empty.\n\n392\n00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:29.670\nIt just needs to be defined, so I can wire\nit up and then I can fill it in later.\n\n393\n00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.620\nAnd I like making lists like this because\n\n394\n00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:37.300\nI make sure everything's in place\nas I build these applications.\n\n395\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:45.150\nAnd then likewise I'm gonna have\nan increaseButton.addEvent listener and\n\n396\n00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:51.850\nalso on click and I'm gonna create another\nfunction called inc for increase, right?\n\n397\n00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.588\nNotice my button name and\nhow it's responding,\n\n398\n00:22:54.588 --> 00:22:57.609\nthey I don't actually\nhave to think about this.\n\n399\n00:22:57.609 --> 00:22:59.120\nWhat does dec do?\n\n400\n00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.870\nWell, that's when you click the\ndecreaseButton, it decreases something.\n\n401\n00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.870\nSo then I'm reducing the cognitive load\n\n402\n00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.570\nthat I need to keep everything\ntogether in my head.\n\n403\n00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.860\nSo I need to build that function.\n\n404\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.443\nActually let's see.\n\n405\n00:23:13.443 --> 00:23:18.040\nIf I refresh,\nnotice it says inc is not defined.\n\n406\n00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.481\nWell, I've referenced a function\nbefore giving it a definition.\n\n407\n00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:27.076\nAnd if I come back, there we go.\n\n408\n00:23:27.076 --> 00:23:33.090\nNow, when you addEvent listeners,\none of my recommendations is go ahead and\n\n409\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:37.670\nfill in something kind of odd like\nconsole.log increase, decrease.\n\n410\n00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.249\nJust so you can check that the button\nclicks are getting linked up as you\n\n411\n00:23:41.249 --> 00:23:42.227\nanticipate them.\n\n412\n00:23:42.227 --> 00:23:46.575\nBecause if I accidentally leave\nthat l out and it's an easy thing,\n\n413\n00:23:46.575 --> 00:23:49.614\nyou're like yeah, it's all good to go.\n\n414\n00:23:49.614 --> 00:23:53.480\nAnd then you start clicking after you've\nbuilt the entire app and it doesn't work.\n\n415\n00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.692\nAnd you go wonder why that doesn't work.\n\n416\n00:23:55.692 --> 00:24:01.076\nAnd it takes a long time as the app\ngrows to find errors like this.\n\n417\n00:24:01.076 --> 00:24:06.068\nBut right now if it doesn't click, I only\nhave two lines I have to sift through,\n\n418\n00:24:06.068 --> 00:24:06.600\nright?\n\n419\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:15.020\nSo for the decrease,\nI'm gonna fill in console.log decreasing.\n\n420\n00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.057\nAnd for the increase,\nI'm gonna put console.log.\n\n421\n00:24:18.057 --> 00:24:24.200\nAnd let's move this up a little bit here,\nIncreasing.\n\n422\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.930\nNow if I have this wired up appropriately,\n\n423\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.380\nwhen I click the plus button,\nI should see increasing.\n\n424\n00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.940\nWhen I click the minus,\nI should see decreasing.\n\n425\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.320\nSo if I refresh, okay, looks good.\n\n426\n00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.940\nIncreasing, decreasing, increasing,\nincreasing, increasing, decreasing.\n\n427\n00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.290\nI've already started getting this\ncount mechanism kind of wired up.\n\n428\n00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.420\nWell, that's good.\n\n429\n00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.758\nWe're doing well, right, so.\n\n430\n00:24:52.758 --> 00:24:55.713\n&gt;&gt; So your methodology is\nbasically to build bits at a time,\n\n431\n00:24:55.713 --> 00:24:59.471\nverify their veracity or integrity\nthat it's working as expected, and\n\n432\n00:24:59.471 --> 00:25:01.151\nthen continue to build up that.\n\n433\n00:25:01.151 --> 00:25:05.753\nSo that way you don't get too far ahead of\nyourself, ultimately developing the entire\n\n434\n00:25:05.753 --> 00:25:10.085\nthing, going to hit the Play button and\nwatch the world crumble down around you.\n\n435\n00:25:10.085 --> 00:25:11.415\nAnd you go, why is this happening?\n\n436\n00:25:11.415 --> 00:25:13.325\nYou've got 600 lines of code or whatever.\n\n437\n00:25:13.325 --> 00:25:15.035\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's a key point.\n\n438\n00:25:15.035 --> 00:25:16.705\nI'm glad you recognize that.\n\n439\n00:25:16.705 --> 00:25:21.240\nI'm hoping that's what's conveyed here\nbecause I've seen time and time again,\n\n440\n00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.034\nyou build an entire application or\nyou attempt to.\n\n441\n00:25:24.034 --> 00:25:26.282\nThings break, you get discouraged,\n\n442\n00:25:26.282 --> 00:25:30.788\nyou go I don't know you would ever\npossibly build something of large scope.\n\n443\n00:25:30.788 --> 00:25:35.470\nAnd that's because there's a saying,\nhow do you eat an elephant, right?\n\n444\n00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.210\n&gt;&gt; One bite at a time.\n\n445\n00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.580\n&gt;&gt; One bite at a time.\n\n446\n00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.610\nIf you take it little chunks at a time,\nI have one focus.\n\n447\n00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.370\nI have tiny little pieces that I\nneed to successfully complete, and\n\n448\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.730\nI don't get overwhelmed by\nhow much I still have to do.\n\n449\n00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.420\nI'm not even thinking about what I\nneed to do until that next step.\n\n450\n00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I used to have a boss that said,\nby the inch, it's a cinch,\n\n451\n00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.980\nby the yard, it's hard.\n\n452\n00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.217\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, that's the same kind of thing.\n\n453\n00:25:57.217 --> 00:25:58.323\nI do the same thing myself.\n\n454\n00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:00.843\nI like to because I don't trust myself,\nright?\n\n455\n00:26:00.843 --> 00:26:03.190\nI'm not the best coder.\n\n456\n00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.340\nI know a bit about this stuff.\n\n457\n00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.080\nSo I really want to verify,\nokay, that is going to work.\n\n458\n00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.600\nNow I can move forward.\n\n459\n00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.690\n&gt;&gt; And I would say, Daniel, that you\nfind more success, doing that than other\n\n460\n00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.059\npeople who are like, yeah, I just sit down\nand bang out a thousand lines of code.\n\n461\n00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.340\nAnd now it doesn't work, right?\n\n462\n00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.400\nEspecially, in JavaScript will kinda\ntell you where the error happens\n\n463\n00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.430\nunless it's a runtime error.\n\n464\n00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.840\nCompiled languages will do that also, but\ncompiled languages can have those errors\n\n465\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.790\noccur on those lines for\na variety of reasons.\n\n466\n00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.640\nYou're like, that should definitely work.\n\n467\n00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.930\nThat's not an integer.\n\n468\n00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.117\nBut now you've gotta go figure\nout why that's not an integer.\n\n469\n00:26:42.117 --> 00:26:43.270\nI thought it was an integer.\n\n470\n00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.210\nIt was an integer here.\n\n471\n00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:45.680\nWhy is it not an integer here?\n\n472\n00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.300\nAnd it's crazy.\n\n473\n00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.130\nJavaScript, in that respect,\nI find a little easier to reason about.\n\n474\n00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.730\nThat's not always the case.\n\n475\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.010\nSo I have these two functions hooked up.\n\n476\n00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.090\nWe should probably get, okay.\n\n477\n00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.560\nWe'll come back and\nlook at these functions.\n\n478\n00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.980\nLet's do this remainder.\n\n479\n00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.850\nWhen I update, right?\n\n480\n00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:06.060\nWhen I increase or decrease,\nI wanna do a couple of things.\n\n481\n00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:14.530\nWhen I increase, I wanna take this count\nand I want to increase it by one, right?\n\n482\n00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.770\nI'm counting up.\n\n483\n00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.127\nWhen I decrease,\nI want to decrease it by one.\n\n484\n00:27:19.127 --> 00:27:23.927\nSo instead of keeping this here,\nI'm gonna say count + = uh-oh,\n\n485\n00:27:23.927 --> 00:27:26.890\nI was about to have a whoopsy daisy there.\n\n486\n00:27:28.423 --> 00:27:32.240\nAnd I'm going to say count += 1.\n\n487\n00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.371\nSo increase is adding one,\ndecrease is subtracting one.\n\n488\n00:27:36.371 --> 00:27:39.863\nBut we're still at an issue here.\n\n489\n00:27:39.863 --> 00:27:42.584\nI need to put this information, right,\n\n490\n00:27:42.584 --> 00:27:47.560\nthere's a div there that should be\ndisplaying what the value of count is.\n\n491\n00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.160\nAnd that's the part where I'm\ngonna take this data, and\n\n492\n00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.230\nI'm going to pipe it to the HTML.\n\n493\n00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.810\nAnd I'm gonna do that through\nthis display reference.\n\n494\n00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:03.210\nBut that's almost like it would be\na function in and of itself, right?\n\n495\n00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.562\nI'm manipulating the data,\n[SOUND] there's an update.\n\n496\n00:28:06.562 --> 00:28:07.769\nI'm going to render it to the page.\n\n497\n00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:11.050\nSo I'm gonna write a final function, and\n\n498\n00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:16.590\nthis may not be our final final function,\ncalled render.\n\n499\n00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.828\nAnd what is render gonna do?\n\n500\n00:28:17.828 --> 00:28:21.443\nIts sole job,\nits single responsibility and\n\n501\n00:28:21.443 --> 00:28:26.401\nthat's important, is to take your data and\nput it in the DOM.\n\n502\n00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:27.210\nThat's all it does.\n\n503\n00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.520\nYou may have some logic in here for\nactually doing it, but\n\n504\n00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.390\nit should be, actually, your render\nfunction should be fairly simple.\n\n505\n00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.910\nNow I call this render because I think\nof like a rendering out graphics.\n\n506\n00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:44.000\nBut it can also be sometimes\ncalled the update function, so\n\n507\n00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.840\nit's updating what you're seeing.\n\n508\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.370\nBut for our purposes,\nwe're going to use render.\n\n509\n00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.520\nSo when I count, if I have changed data,\n\n510\n00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:00.740\nI need to make it update or\nre-render what you see on the page.\n\n511\n00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.360\nSo every time I click, the very last\nthing I am going to do is render.\n\n512\n00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:11.121\nThe very last thing I'm going\nto do is render, right?\n\n513\n00:29:11.121 --> 00:29:14.690\nI have modified the data,\nupdate what I see.\n\n514\n00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:18.538\nModify the data,\nupdate what I see, same here.\n\n515\n00:29:18.538 --> 00:29:22.696\nNow because I've thought that process\nthrough and I made that a function,\n\n516\n00:29:22.696 --> 00:29:26.134\nI only have a tiny little bit that\nI need to figure out how to do.\n\n517\n00:29:26.134 --> 00:29:27.989\nHow do I render?\n\n518\n00:29:27.989 --> 00:29:28.920\nWhat am I rendering?\n\n519\n00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.820\nWhat am I putting into the DOM?\n\n520\n00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.820\nI'm taking the count data and\nputting it into the DOM.\n\n521\n00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.678\nThe DOM has a display, okay, and\n\n522\n00:29:39.678 --> 00:29:44.392\nthat display has a text content field.\n\n523\n00:29:44.392 --> 00:29:49.639\nAnd if I can take the value of count and\nput that in the display, then every\n\n524\n00:29:49.639 --> 00:29:55.250\ntime render is called, it will take\nwhatever's in count and put it in there.\n\n525\n00:29:56.348 --> 00:29:58.359\nWell, actually, let's try to do that.\n\n526\n00:29:58.359 --> 00:30:05.860\nAnd we can do that by saying,\ndisplay.textContent = count.\n\n527\n00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.226\nAnd this throws people off.\n\n528\n00:30:07.226 --> 00:30:11.280\nThey think rendering\nshould be crazy complex.\n\n529\n00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.484\nIt depends on the context of your app.\n\n530\n00:30:13.484 --> 00:30:17.867\nIf I'm just taking a single number and\nputting it into an HTML tag,\n\n531\n00:30:17.867 --> 00:30:20.153\nit should be one line, two lines.\n\n532\n00:30:20.153 --> 00:30:22.808\nMost of my render functions\ntend to be fairly simple in\n\n533\n00:30:22.808 --> 00:30:25.320\nthe grand scope of things, right?\n\n534\n00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.840\nSo don't be worried if this\nis very simple to you.\n\n535\n00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.900\nBut now,\nI think our app might actually work.\n\n536\n00:30:35.719 --> 00:30:39.480\nOkay, plus, hey.\n\n537\n00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.880\nBut there is a problem, right?\n\n538\n00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:47.260\nOn page load, I don't have quite\nwhat I anticipated, right?\n\n539\n00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.830\nWhen I click plus and\n\n540\n00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:54.140\nminus the first time,\nI have a fully functioning counting it.\n\n541\n00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.740\nBut if I refresh, I got something wrong.\n\n542\n00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.320\nSo on this load, what do I wanna do?\n\n543\n00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.450\nWell, when this script runs, part of\nmy setup, after I set up everything,\n\n544\n00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.400\ngrab the references, get everything up and\n\n545\n00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.840\ngoing, I actually need to\nrender the first time.\n\n546\n00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.844\nCuz if I don't do an initial render,\nthen nothing's updated, right?\n\n547\n00:31:17.844 --> 00:31:20.430\nI wanna take whatever the data starts as,\nand go ahead and\n\n548\n00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:25.250\nput it in the DOM in anticipation for\nthe changes that are to come.\n\n549\n00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:30.150\nSo if I do that and\nsomehow do weird pinchy things, and\n\n550\n00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.760\nI refresh,\nnow when I refresh I have a counter.\n\n551\n00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:39.580\nSo this is building it, obviously a very\nsimple somewhat contrived application.\n\n552\n00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.240\nAnd I can get negative numbers,\nwell, I may wanna change that.\n\n553\n00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.640\nSome of these things\nare probably better left to,\n\n554\n00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.440\nlike an extension episode as well\nas reorganization of the code.\n\n555\n00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.300\nWhat do you think, Daniel?\n\n556\n00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.867\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's probably\nwhere we're headed cuz I know he's\n\n557\n00:31:54.867 --> 00:31:55.460\ngot tons more.\n\n558\n00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.560\nObviously this is not, wow, look at this\nawesome web page that Justin has built.\n\n559\n00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.514\nWell, it does have these applications.\n\n560\n00:32:02.514 --> 00:32:03.754\nI'm already thinking about how I\ncould use it at the blackjack table.\n\n561\n00:32:03.754 --> 00:32:07.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, to count for me.\n\n562\n00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.720\nWe wanna get a little beyond that.\n\n563\n00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.870\nWe wanna continue on and\nsee what else we can do.\n\n564\n00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.570\nSo definitely got some\nmore episodes coming up\n\n565\n00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.990\nwith using these types of abilities and\n\n566\n00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.460\nbuilding a website that actually does\nsomething more than just maybe counting.\n\n567\n00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.560\nJustin, thanks for\njoining us today, though, and\n\n568\n00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.430\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou in those episodes.\n\n569\n00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.210\nHopefully you guys will join us\nthere as well, see where this leads.\n\n570\n00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.910\nWhere do we end up?\n\n571\n00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.730\nWhat is this ultimate\nwebsite we're gonna build do?\n\n572\n00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.255\nThat's something you've gotta wait for.\n\n573\n00:32:31.255 --> 00:32:34.490\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n574\n00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.510\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n575\n00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:39.482\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n576\n00:32:39.482 --> 00:32:43.665\n[MUSIC]\n\n577\n00:32:43.665 --> 00:32:45.570\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:06.911\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.911 --> 00:00:08.409\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:12.770\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.980\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.940\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are continuing on\n\n9\n00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.320\nwith more on our intro to\nweb development series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.950\nAnd coming back to the studio, helping us\ncontinue to build our lovely fresh and\n\n11\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.240\nbrand new Web API continue on with that,\nour good friend Mr Justin Denison.\n\n12\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.810\nJustin, my man welcome back.\n\n13\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.560\nHows is it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.140\n&gt;&gt; It's going well.\n\n15\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.490\nThank for having me back Daniel.\n\n16\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.410\nHow are you today?\n\n17\n00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.660\n&gt;&gt; I'm very well.\nThank you for asking.\n\n18\n00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.190\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWe'll see if that continue to be the case.\n\n19\n00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.620\nAs we continue on our look into\nthis very simple web application.\n\n20\n00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.330\nAgain nothing that is\nlike ground breaking, but\n\n21\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.360\nit's definitely the beginnings of how\ndo I use HTML and Java Script and\n\n22\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.280\nCSS to build something\nthat is interactive.\n\n23\n00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.520\nNow in the previous part one episode,\nwe actually built the counter.\n\n24\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.420\nIf you haven't seen that,\n\n25\n00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.460\nI definitely recommend going to\nsee how this all came to fruition.\n\n26\n00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.460\nBut we left off.\n\n27\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.960\nIt looked like it was finished.\n\n28\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.240\nBut a common thing that I hear,\nthat I've been told, is well,\n\n29\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.280\nlet's put ourself into a more,\nlike, worker role, right?\n\n30\n00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.290\nI just built this counter.\n\n31\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.050\nI was asked to build this counter\nby my boss or by a client,\n\n32\n00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.230\nif you're a freelance developer.\n\n33\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.720\nWe're pretending here, we're role playing.\n\n34\n00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.770\nAnd then, I submit this code, right?\n\n35\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.008\nWell, here's your counter.\n\n36\n00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.447\nAnd they go, well, this does work and\n\n37\n00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:35.420\ndoes exactly as I ask you to except\nthe code, it's not really maintainable.\n\n38\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.360\nIf I need to keep this and kinda poke\naround on it, It's hard to maintain.\n\n39\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.670\nAlso, I wanna integrate this\nin other web applications.\n\n40\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.990\nRight now you're using what\nare called global variables, right.\n\n41\n00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.550\nThe variables are just\navailable everywhere.\n\n42\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.390\nAnd, if I put that in another\nweb application where there's\n\n43\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.330\na mismatch, right.\n\n44\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.150\nI have the variable count in\nmy counter application and\n\n45\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.860\na variable count in another\npart of the application,\n\n46\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.020\nthen those will clash if\nthey're both global in scope.\n\n47\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.320\nSo how do we fix this?\n\n48\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.150\nSo today we're actually\ngoing to tackle a refactor.\n\n49\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.850\nNow, this refactoring process,\nit's very subjective in nature.\n\n50\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.600\nI'm gonna show you how I would\nrefactor this into a more\n\n51\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.760\nmaintainable kinda modular piece.\n\n52\n00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.050\nNot necessarily for distribution,\nbut just getting to the ideas,\n\n53\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.640\nthe thought process of.\n\n54\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.510\nHow do I take these global variables and\nall this information and bundle it up?\n\n55\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.280\nWhere now, I just have to\nmove this to other parts of,\n\n56\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.290\neither my application or\nto someone else's application.\n\n57\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.750\nAnd get reduceability without having\nto tweak and change all the time, so.\n\n58\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.120\nAgain, this is how would I approach it.\n\n59\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.610\nIt's not necessarily the only way to\napproach it, and that's important to know.\n\n60\n00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.710\n&gt;&gt; So just now, are we talking about\nbasically taking the code that we've\n\n61\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.420\nwritten and creating it like\na bolt-on to other web APIs,\n\n62\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.090\njust saying well it's a great feature.\n\n63\n00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.840\nI would love to have that here and\nhere and over there.\n\n64\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.380\nThat would work well there.\n\n65\n00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.530\nAnd now, that being said, if that is\nthe case should we take that approach when\n\n66\n00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.350\nwe begin building our API\nfrom the beginning with,\n\n67\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.680\nthis is eventually going\nto be some sort of bolt-on.\n\n68\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.100\nWe should keep that in mind.\n\n69\n00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.230\n&gt;&gt; So in later times,\nafter you've done this for\n\n70\n00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.170\na while, you very much may\ntake that approach, Daniel.\n\n71\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.500\nHowever, I caution against that and\nmore focus on, let me think this through.\n\n72\n00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.050\nLet me work on a design, let me not worry\nabout this pattern getting in my way,\n\n73\n00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.990\nlet's just get it working, right?\n\n74\n00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.130\nEspecially if you're starting\nthis just from scratch.\n\n75\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.960\nYou're just starting to get into web\ndevelopment and you're like, well,\n\n76\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.170\nI don't even really know how that\ndocument.query selector works.\n\n77\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.380\nHow do I force this into this pattern?\n\n78\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.800\nI would say, write it once.\n\n79\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.060\nGo through and digest it.\n\n80\n00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.040\nWhat are these individual pieces?\n\n81\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.320\nAnd part of the refractor process,\n\n82\n00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.760\nas you'll see is,\nI'll change a little bit here.\n\n83\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.470\nYou may even remove code completely.\n\n84\n00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.080\nI don't really need this part.\n\n85\n00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.180\nWith our simple application, that may or\nmay not be quite as appropriate.\n\n86\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.470\nBut you'll see,\nthis doesn't work in this context.\n\n87\n00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.160\nI want to change how this behaves just a\nlittle bit, just for that maintainability.\n\n88\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.920\nSo I wouldn't worry about employing\nthese patterns from the very outset,\n\n89\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.235\nthough it is tempting.\n\n90\n00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:22.160\nI find that when beginners undertake this,\nthey somehow get worried about\n\n91\n00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.479\nmaking this construct instead of worried\nabout getting this application to work.\n\n92\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.800\nSo, I think the first\nthing we should do is,\n\n93\n00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.660\ndo a quick review of what\nwe have in our application.\n\n94\n00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.730\nAnd then, let's do,\n\n95\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.140\nundergo some thought processes about\nhow we're going to attack this.\n\n96\n00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.370\nSo let's go ahead and\nhop down into our text editor here.\n\n97\n00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.700\nAnd if we look,\nnotice I have all of these elements.\n\n98\n00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.949\nThough I have organization,\n\n99\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.910\nall of these are available in\nwhat is called the global scope.\n\n100\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.620\nThey're actually attached\nto the window object.\n\n101\n00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.640\nAnd to show you that, I'm going to\nhop over to my browser, refresh, and\n\n102\n00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.270\nif I type window, well,\nlet me zoom in on that.\n\n103\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.620\nWindow dot, let's say, count.\n\n104\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.000\nUndefined, it could be iffy.\n\n105\n00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.170\nLet me see here, count.\n\n106\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.700\nI lied, because these are block scoped.\n\n107\n00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.835\nVery, very sorry about that.\n\n108\n00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:13.640\nMis-speak on mine.\n\n109\n00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.360\nThe let does help with that scoping issue.\n\n110\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.050\nWith those new ES6 features.\n\n111\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.180\nBut let's say that you hadn't used that.\n\n112\n00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.140\nThen, that is interesting.\n\n113\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.280\nIs something not rendering?\n\n114\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.070\nHm, wait for it.\n\n115\n00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:35.900\nWindow, window.count.\n\n116\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.380\nThere we go, it finally kicks off.\n\n117\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.670\nSo it took a little bit\nto kinda kick off there.\n\n118\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.260\nAnd that's something to keep in mind,\n\n119\n00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.410\nyour JavaScript may not run\nimmediately as it goes through.\n\n120\n00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.480\n&gt;&gt; That can be very confusing to\nthe new web developer who's like,\n\n121\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.190\nI'm pretty sure this is supposed to work.\n\n122\n00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.875\nAnd I'm not getting\nthe expected output here.\n\n123\n00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:57.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so\n\n124\n00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.014\n&gt;&gt; Do keep in mind that just because\n\n125\n00:05:59.014 --> 00:06:02.214\nit's on the screen doesn't mean that\neverything's kind of set up there.\n\n126\n00:06:02.214 --> 00:06:05.562\nUsually on a web application this\nsmall that doesn't happen, but\n\n127\n00:06:05.562 --> 00:06:09.600\nas you've seen it doesn't necessarily\nmean that it will never happen.\n\n128\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.820\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n129\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.170\nNow using and\nconst does help a little bit with that?\n\n130\n00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.881\nBut you know, right now I would have\nto take this entire at.js maybe\n\n131\n00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:22.444\nchange it's name to counter.js and\n\n132\n00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:26.840\nput it somewhere else as well as\nthis exact markup has to exist.\n\n133\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.150\nNow there's not a lot\nthat we can get around.\n\n134\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.660\nWe can't get around from\nhaving this markup.\n\n135\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.510\nBut we can make this to where right now if\nanywhere else on the page there is an id\n\n136\n00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.340\nof increase or display or decrease.\n\n137\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.540\nHm, we may have name clashes.\n\n138\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.570\nWe may actually select the wrong\nHTML element using JavaScript.\n\n139\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.770\nSo we're going to address that\nas we go through this refactor.\n\n140\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.230\nNow during this refractor, I'm actually\ngoing to use an object literal.\n\n141\n00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.700\nJust a plain object to bundle all\nof this up And then start it up.\n\n142\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.660\nSo let's go ahead and get started on that.\n\n143\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.720\nAnd because I had my code organized\nin this way, I can just go line\n\n144\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.800\nby line and go through individual\npieces and add them to the object.\n\n145\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.090\nSo I'm going to name this counter.\n\n146\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.020\nAnd it's an object literal.\n\n147\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.060\nSo I'm just going to start\nwith a plain object.\n\n148\n00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.530\nAnd with using an object literal\nI get one instance of this.\n\n149\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.580\nSo I can't easily make\n30 counters on a page.\n\n150\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.070\nThat comes with a different\ndesign pattern, but\n\n151\n00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.530\nit's good to know this pattern.\n\n152\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.900\nSo what do I need first?\n\n153\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.140\nI need my data.\n\n154\n00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.620\nOkay, so data, and\nwe're gonna call that count.\n\n155\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.410\nAnd what is count initially, zero.\n\n156\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.900\nOkay, so I've taken this line and\ntranslated it to counter.\n\n157\n00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.352\nAt current time I'm not going to\ncomment out any of the blow code\n\n158\n00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:56.048\nbecause well things are gonna break.\n\n159\n00:07:56.048 --> 00:07:56.988\nSo we have count.\n\n160\n00:07:56.988 --> 00:07:58.368\nNow what do we want?\n\n161\n00:07:58.368 --> 00:07:59.318\nWell.\n\n162\n00:07:59.318 --> 00:08:01.561\nIf you read back through this.\n\n163\n00:08:01.561 --> 00:08:06.552\nNotice that I am caching the dom,\nI am doing some additional setup,\n\n164\n00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:09.710\nand I am calling a render once.\n\n165\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.000\nAnd then all of these other\nfunctions need to exist.\n\n166\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.690\nLet's actually go through and\nsay that when I start up or\n\n167\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:24.270\ninitialize I need an init function,\nshort for initialization.\n\n168\n00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.550\nThis is what's going to do this startup,\nsetup functionality.\n\n169\n00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.720\nI need to setup what the element that's\nreferenced for is used, excuse me.\n\n170\n00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.110\nLet me rephrase that.\n\n171\n00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:40.180\nI'm going to assign this element to the\nID, notice that I've hard coded it here,\n\n172\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.840\nbut this was an illusion to what\nwe were getting ready to do.\n\n173\n00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.410\nI need to cache the dom.\n\n174\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.590\ni need to add any event listeners\nthat I have and I need to render.\n\n175\n00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.042\nIn addition to, and\nnotice I have IDs right here.\n\n176\n00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:57.044\nMaybe ID's are not the best way.\n\n177\n00:08:57.044 --> 00:09:00.560\nBecause if I have an ID of increase\nanywhere else in the application,\n\n178\n00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.870\nI may accidentally select that one,\n\n179\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.380\nespecially if it comes on\nthe HTML page before my counter.\n\n180\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.500\nSo, we'll mess around with it and\n\n181\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.140\nessentially make this little\nblock with the ID of app,\n\n182\n00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.100\nthat will be my counter and I will\nbe searching only within that space.\n\n183\n00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.160\nSo, that's good to know,\nI'm kinda encapsulating these together and\n\n184\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.820\nI only need to move pieces of it.\n\n185\n00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.790\nSo, I have my init function.\n\n186\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.910\nWhat is that going to do?\n\n187\n00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.350\nIt's going to do the setup that I need.\n\n188\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:38.030\nAnd part of that setup is cache the dom,\njust like I have.\n\n189\n00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.630\nI'm listing back through\nthe steps that I already have.\n\n190\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.930\nAnd addListeners and be very careful.\n\n191\n00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:51.420\nI used to write add event\nlisteners as part of that, and\n\n192\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.380\nadd event listeners already a method,\n\n193\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.440\nand I found that though it made\nsense to me, it was hard for people.\n\n194\n00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.220\nWhat's the difference between\nadd event listeners with an S,\n\n195\n00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.950\nand add event listener?\n\n196\n00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:09.030\nWell one is a function that I wrote and\nthe other one is part of the web API for\n\n197\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.120\nadding like click events on transition\nevents, things of that nature.\n\n198\n00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.790\nAnd then finally I know\nthat I need a render.\n\n199\n00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.300\nAnd, should probably write that correctly.\n\n200\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.073\nI thought you're gonna say redneck.\n\n201\n00:10:23.073 --> 00:10:24.881\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well that's interesting.\n\n202\n00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:27.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, [INAUDIBLE] that's what they are.\n\n203\n00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.850\nSo if I go back through,\nnotice that I have render.\n\n204\n00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.813\nWhich is part of that set up.\n\n205\n00:10:32.813 --> 00:10:35.934\nRight, I called that part of the set\nup that's actually part of our\n\n206\n00:10:35.934 --> 00:10:36.840\ninitialization.\n\n207\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.950\nI'm caching, I'm adding listeners,\nand I'm rendering.\n\n208\n00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.020\nSo we could actually write\nour init function right now.\n\n209\n00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.720\nSo if we go up to init,\nwhat is init doing?\n\n210\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.820\nWell, it is saying hey counter,\nnotice that this variable name,\n\n211\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.490\nand I'm gonna come back and change this.\n\n212\n00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.450\nI just want to provide some clarity,\nI will come back and change this.\n\n213\n00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:04.146\nI want to cache the dom,\ncounter add listeners.\n\n214\n00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:10.730\nAnd counter render.\n\n215\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:15.230\nThat's how, that's what we're going to\nneed to do in order to set up this counter\n\n216\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.200\nthe first time.\n\n217\n00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.720\nAfter that, the event listeners and\neverything will take over.\n\n218\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.340\nOkay now notice we have a decrement and\nincrement.\n\n219\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.480\nWe'll get back to those later.\n\n220\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.375\nBut if we look here what else do we have.\n\n221\n00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:29.610\nWe need to cache dom.\n\n222\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.270\nWell what is cache dom?\n\n223\n00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.230\nAnd this is where some of\nthe changes are going to take place.\n\n224\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.260\nNotice I have this root element.\n\n225\n00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.960\nI have increase button,\ndecrease button, and display.\n\n226\n00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.070\nThese are ID's.\n\n227\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.910\nI actually, I'm gonna change\nthose as we put those in here.\n\n228\n00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:51.971\nSo rootElement and document.querySelector.\n\n229\n00:11:51.971 --> 00:11:56.870\nAnd then we are still gonna\nkeep that as app, okay?\n\n230\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:03.000\nBut from here on in,\nI am going to say increase button.\n\n231\n00:12:05.374 --> 00:12:09.180\nAnd I'm just reproducing this,\nwe're gonna go back and change this const.\n\n232\n00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:14.600\nBut instead of document,\nI'm gonna say rootElement.querySelector.\n\n233\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.870\nAnd because the root\nelement is a special type,\n\n234\n00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.920\nit's an HTML element,\nI can search within its context,\n\n235\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.680\nusing query selector only Instead\nof searching the entire document.\n\n236\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.700\nAnd that'll keep me from accidentally\ngetting the wrong increase.\n\n237\n00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.250\nOkay, but in addition to that,\n\n238\n00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.310\nI don't want to select the ID\nbecause I'm guarding against it.\n\n239\n00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.940\nI'm gonna change that to a class, and\n\n240\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.620\nthat way I can make sure that if\nthere's multiple ones on the page,\n\n241\n00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.230\nI don't accidentally get into\nsome weirdness there, okay.\n\n242\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.840\nIt's just a thought process.\n\n243\n00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.190\nIs this the only way to do this?\n\n244\n00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.700\nAbsolutely not.\n\n245\n00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.880\nAnd then, I'm going to do the same\nthing for decrease button.\n\n246\n00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.000\nNow, I have to make\nsure that I go back and\n\n247\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.300\nchange those to classes, cuz otherwise,\nwe'd sit here and look at it and\n\n248\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.130\ngo, that's not working,\nso this is decrease.\n\n249\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.020\nAnd finally we want the display.\n\n250\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:17.380\nAnd that's also within the root element,\nand there we go.\n\n251\n00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.700\nNow before I forget we\nshould probably go back and\n\n252\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.950\nchange these from ID's to classes.\n\n253\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:31.160\nSo I'm gonna grab this increase, cut it,\nand place it within the class list.\n\n254\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.920\nNow the class list can be multiple ones,\nthey are separated,\n\n255\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.010\nthey are delimited by spaces, right?\n\n256\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.200\nI have increase class and\nthe button class.\n\n257\n00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.030\nOkay?\n\n258\n00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.690\nDisplay, I'm just gonna\nchange that to class, and\n\n259\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.950\nthen decrease I'm gonna do the same\nthing that I did with increase.\n\n260\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.898\nAnd there we go.\n\n261\n00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:52.319\nOkay.\n\n262\n00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:57.050\nNow what we're gonna do\nis this is a fairly.\n\n263\n00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.120\nI mean there's no way\nto check incrementally.\n\n264\n00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.930\nWell.\n\n265\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.520\nThere's not an easy to check,\nnot to say there's no way.\n\n266\n00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.400\nSo we're gonna do this\nthe entire refactor.\n\n267\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.860\nAnd what you might see is\nsome things are broken, but\n\n268\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.580\nthat's just a little bit of debugging\nthat we have to undergo, so no worries.\n\n269\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.050\nSo I've now changed this\nthe only ID that I have is L.\n\n270\n00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.923\nThat's good to know, okay.\n\n271\n00:14:20.923 --> 00:14:25.274\nSo now this should work,\nthat's part of my initialization but\n\n272\n00:14:25.274 --> 00:14:29.544\nright now rude element increase button,\ndecrease button and\n\n273\n00:14:29.544 --> 00:14:33.650\ndisplay are only available\ninside the cache dom function,\n\n274\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:38.900\nI actually want this to available for\nthis entire object, kind of.\n\n275\n00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.130\nPackaged together.\n\n276\n00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.560\nI want it to be everywhere,\nso I'm going to say counter,\n\n277\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.530\nthat is not how you spell counter.\n\n278\n00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:52.880\nCounter., I'm adding it as a property, and\nwe'll go see how this changes some things.\n\n279\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.870\nI'm gonna leave display alone,\nso I'm going to say counter.\n\n280\n00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.520\nAnd decrease button is going\nto be part of counter, but\n\n281\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.430\nI'm gonna leave display like this.\n\n282\n00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.370\nJust to show you what would happen.\n\n283\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:10.210\nSo if we hop over, and we refresh,\nadd event listener of null.\n\n284\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.170\nOkay, well let's see here.\n\n285\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.920\nThat's because we changed these\nfrom IDs and now this is broke.\n\n286\n00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.580\nSo we're not worried about it being broke,\n\n287\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.930\nwe wanna look at\nthe actual counter object.\n\n288\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:30.570\nAnd notice this is addEventListeners,\ncacheDom, init, count.\n\n289\n00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.920\nBut didn't I just add\nproperties to the object?\n\n290\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.640\nWhy haven't those been added?\n\n291\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.030\nWhy haven't, nothing's happened?\n\n292\n00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.800\nAnd here's a common error\nwhen using this pattern.\n\n293\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.400\nJust because I have told it what to do\n\n294\n00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.460\nI haven't actually told\nthe counter object to start.\n\n295\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:51.267\nI have to call init on this\nobject in order for it to work.\n\n296\n00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:56.189\nSo Counter.init, so I define\nthe object and then I start it up.\n\n297\n00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:58.000\nIt's kinda like a car,\nyou gotta start it up.\n\n298\n00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.618\nSo if I go back and refresh,\nwe're still gonna have this error.\n\n299\n00:16:01.618 --> 00:16:03.880\nRootElement, that's good to know.\n\n300\n00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.880\nRootElement, root haha.\n\n301\n00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.280\nNotice how I added\nCounter.rootElement here.\n\n302\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.033\nI now have to name space that, or\n\n303\n00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:17.491\nadd this prefix [SOUND] to everywhere.\n\n304\n00:16:17.491 --> 00:16:18.880\nAnd there's a shorter way.\n\n305\n00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.260\nI'm actually gonna go back and\nchange that.\n\n306\n00:16:21.631 --> 00:16:25.710\nBut you're like, well,\nthat's a lot more code.\n\n307\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.250\nWhy would I do that?\n\n308\n00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.250\nWell, I typically don't write\ncounter out as the variable name.\n\n309\n00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.140\nAlso, this is about bundling and\nreproducibility.\n\n310\n00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:39.300\nA little more code for reproducibility,\neasier to maintain is okay as\n\n311\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.905\nlong as this variable name's not a counter\nwith plus and minus button awesome, right?\n\n312\n00:16:43.905 --> 00:16:47.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess it is, I guess it is.\n\n313\n00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.890\nSo if we go and refresh,\ncannot read property.\n\n314\n00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.620\nThat's from the lines below.\n\n315\n00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:58.240\nBut if I look at counter now and\nyou'll notice that my root element,\n\n316\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.490\nmy decrease button, Aae all available\nto me as a property on the object.\n\n317\n00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.350\nBut what's not there?\n\n318\n00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.910\nWell, display's not there\nbecause display only exists\n\n319\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.760\ninside the context of cache DOM.\n\n320\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.350\nI want this to be available everywhere\nbecause I need to modify the display\n\n321\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.271\nupon certain events.\n\n322\n00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:19.844\nRight?\n\n323\n00:17:19.844 --> 00:17:24.600\nI need to click the increase button,\nthe count changes and\n\n324\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.300\nthen render is going to\nmake that update occur.\n\n325\n00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:36.970\nSo, I need to add that same\nnamespace property there.\n\n326\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:42.830\nSo, if I go back and look at counter,\nnotice that I have decrease,\n\n327\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.420\nincrease, root element, and\nwhere did my display go?\n\n328\n00:17:50.973 --> 00:17:54.230\nDisplay, display, display.\n\n329\n00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.420\nDon't forget to save.\n\n330\n00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.630\nThat's a very important thing to remember.\n\n331\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.190\nIf you forget to save, and it won't.\n\n332\n00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.610\n&gt;&gt; You won't apply to the actual thing?\n\n333\n00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.176\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, no.\n[LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:18:02.176 --> 00:18:02.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:18:02.688 --> 00:18:04.850\n&gt;&gt; It won't just work magically.\n\n336\n00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.560\nSo it's good to see that though.\n\n337\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.580\nBecause sometimes when I teach this it\njust all looks like magic and rainbows.\n\n338\n00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.070\nPeople are like, you never make a mistake.\n\n339\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:16.010\nI do in fact make a bunch of mistakes,\nand that's part of development.\n\n340\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.710\nJust go back, be methodical, and\n\n341\n00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.930\nnotice when I actually do save I have\ndisplay as a property on the object.\n\n342\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.740\nSo now I have all of these properties.\n\n343\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.580\nI have cache dump,\nI have actually gotten down to this point.\n\n344\n00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.670\nI have reproduced that part.\n\n345\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.340\nNow, I need to add listeners.\n\n346\n00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.630\nWell, where do I add listeners?\n\n347\n00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:36.560\nRight here.\n\n348\n00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.310\nAnd notice, each one of these\nfunctions within the object,\n\n349\n00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.940\nalso known as methods if they're contained\nwithin an object, they have one purpose.\n\n350\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.270\nThey do nothing else but that one thing.\n\n351\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.670\nWhat is cacheDom do?\n\n352\n00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.950\nI bet it caches the DOM, it's not.\n\n353\n00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:56.750\nIt cache with the DOM and\nyou want this to be single in nature.\n\n354\n00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.960\nThey have a single responsibility\nin what they accomplish.\n\n355\n00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.230\nAnd that way,\nif something goes horribly awry, you go.\n\n356\n00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.690\nWell, I don't have that DOM\nelement cached appropriately.\n\n357\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.410\nWhere do I need to go look for that?\n\n358\n00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.420\nProbably in the cache\ndown function because\n\n359\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.940\nthat's where that caching is occurring.\n\n360\n00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:21.020\nSo now if I say,\nCounter.increaseButton.addeventListener.\n\n361\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.710\nAnd I want to click.\n\n362\n00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.040\nNow this is where it gets weird.\n\n363\n00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.920\nI don't have these functions now.\n\n364\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.340\nPeople would be tempting, well you do have\nthose functions, you can just say this.\n\n365\n00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.440\nBut notice that this function\nis written assuming that\n\n366\n00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.600\nglobal variables are available everywhere,\nright?\n\n367\n00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.210\nCount minus plus, or minus equals one,\nand plus equals one.\n\n368\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.730\nSo I need to come back and add Increment.\n\n369\n00:19:50.992 --> 00:19:53.121\nAnd decrement.\n\n370\n00:19:55.963 --> 00:19:59.136\nSo now, I can say run the counter.ink.\n\n371\n00:20:01.529 --> 00:20:10.202\nAnd decrease\nbutton.addEventListener Click,\n\n372\n00:20:10.202 --> 00:20:14.750\nand counter [SOUND] .dec.\n\n373\n00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.920\nOkay, so now I've attached those events.\n\n374\n00:20:19.317 --> 00:20:22.570\nI have completed this portion.\n\n375\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.020\nWhat about render?\n\n376\n00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.060\nWell, what does render do?\n\n377\n00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.290\nDoes it do anything different?\n\n378\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.130\nNot really,\n\n379\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:33.460\nexcept I just need to reproduce\nthis in the context of the object.\n\n380\n00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.470\nSo this last portion of the initialization\nis that first render, because we don't\n\n381\n00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:42.650\nrender the initial time you get a blank\ncounter until you modify count.\n\n382\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.470\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n383\n00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:53.220\nI'm gonna say Counter.display\n.textContent = Counter.count.\n\n384\n00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.340\nNow, you're like, but\nyou added a lot of code here.\n\n385\n00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.070\nWe gonna simplify that some, don't worry.\n\n386\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.130\nNo worries.\n\n387\n00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.770\nSo, let's go see if that works.\n\n388\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.330\nRefresh, and it's back.\n\n389\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.190\nAnd just to prove it,\nthis is the point where I'm going to.\n\n390\n00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.650\nComment out everything\nelse inside of here.\n\n391\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.730\nSo if we refresh,\nI have no errors.And if I click\n\n392\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.050\nthere's nothing happening because I\nhaven't fully filled out those functions.\n\n393\n00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:25.746\nNow if I want to do that, I have inc,\nwhat does the increase function do?\n\n394\n00:21:25.746 --> 00:21:30.140\nIt takes counter.count and\n\n395\n00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:35.458\nplus equals one, and then counter.render.\n\n396\n00:21:35.458 --> 00:21:40.920\nAgain, just to emphasize, render is\nsometimes seen as an update function.\n\n397\n00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.940\nThere are times when render and update are\ndifferent in more complex frameworks but\n\n398\n00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.220\nfor now,\nwe're just rendering back to the page.\n\n399\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.960\nLet's just go ahead and\nfill in this decrement function.\n\n400\n00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:57.027\nWe have Counter.count -= 1,\nand then Counter.render.\n\n401\n00:21:58.975 --> 00:22:00.140\nThere we go.\n\n402\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:06.250\nSo now, we have this nice, pretty, kind of\nencapsulated object and it is the widget.\n\n403\n00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.310\nI could change this around a little\nbit with very small changes,\n\n404\n00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:13.190\nget a bunch of counters that\nare independent of each other on the page.\n\n405\n00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.990\nAnd that way I can move this,\nit's modular.\n\n406\n00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.840\nI can put this in other applications.\n\n407\n00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.730\nNow this would not be\nthe final read factor but\n\n408\n00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:23.860\nI think this is a good first approximation\nof how I would go about this.\n\n409\n00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.280\nWe should probably make sure it works,\nis a very important thing.\n\n410\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.350\nSo if I hit +, ah-ha, -, it works,\n\n411\n00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.260\nand now I have functions all\nbundled up in a single object.\n\n412\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.480\nThere are not polluting\nthe global name space.\n\n413\n00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.220\nIf someone else wants to use\nthe variable count, more power to them,\n\n414\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.738\nbecause my counter object Is guarding,\nit's like, this is my account.\n\n415\n00:22:46.738 --> 00:22:53.662\nNow to address all of this counter stuff,\nright.\n\n416\n00:22:53.662 --> 00:22:59.030\nThat's weird, hm, if I take counter,\n\n417\n00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.960\nI can actually say for this counter,\nfor this counter object.\n\n418\n00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.580\nCache the DOM, add listeners on render.\n\n419\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.950\nI can do the same thing\ninside of cache DOM.\n\n420\n00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.450\nFor this counter add\nthe property root element.\n\n421\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.300\nFor this increase button it is\nthis counter's root element and\n\n422\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.350\nnow I'm making it a little more general\n\n423\n00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.490\nin anticipation of an additional\nrefactor where I can build a function.\n\n424\n00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:30.550\nIt just gives me counters on counters\non counters as long as I supply what?\n\n425\n00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.700\nThe root element, and that would be\nsomething that you would tweak later on.\n\n426\n00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.333\nAnd then finally in add listeners\nwhen I finally, I say finally and\n\n427\n00:23:40.333 --> 00:23:42.662\nit's not actually the finally.\n\n428\n00:23:42.662 --> 00:23:46.150\nWe have this dot increase,\nthis dot decrease.\n\n429\n00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.810\nOkay, and\nthen we'll do the same thing in render.\n\n430\n00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.259\nAnd then here is where it\nis going to get tricky.\n\n431\n00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:57.156\nIncrease and decrease, notice I'm\nwiring those two an event handler.\n\n432\n00:23:57.156 --> 00:24:00.870\nI'm gonna go ahead and do, what someone\nwould do as they see this first time.\n\n433\n00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.080\nI'm gonna change this.\n\n434\n00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.730\nAll these counters to the keyword this.\n\n435\n00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.930\nBecause it means that this object for\nrender, it does.\n\n436\n00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.710\nFor added listeners, it does.\n\n437\n00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.910\nFor cachedom it does.\n\n438\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.530\nFor init it also does.\n\n439\n00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.562\nAnd even for count, even though I\ndon't have this in a function, but\n\n440\n00:24:19.562 --> 00:24:23.210\nsay this.count,\nit should mean this object's count.\n\n441\n00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.190\nBut what we're gonna see, is refresh.\n\n442\n00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:30.030\nThis.render is not a function.\n\n443\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.940\nWhy is this.render not a function?\n\n444\n00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.113\nAnd notice if we read here,\nand this is why I like dev to,\n\n445\n00:24:36.113 --> 00:24:39.570\nI always have my dev tools open so\nI can see these immediately, cuz what will\n\n446\n00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.970\nhappen is if I don't have these open, I'm\nhitting plus, you're like, it just worked.\n\n447\n00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.200\nWhy doesn't it work now?\n\n448\n00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.750\nI don't understand.\n\n449\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.461\nIf you look it says htmlbutton.inc.\n\n450\n00:24:49.461 --> 00:24:53.134\nWell, htmlbutton.inc,\n\n451\n00:24:53.134 --> 00:24:57.650\nthere is no .inc method on htmlbutton.\n\n452\n00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.040\nWhere did that come from?\n\n453\n00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.500\nAnd in the dev tools,\nsee this little link right here?\n\n454\n00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.220\nIf you click it says hey,\nright here's the problem.\n\n455\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.830\nWell, why is this a problem?\n\n456\n00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.490\nWhy is this not a problem but this is?\n\n457\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:16.180\nSo, if we look, could be the parentheses,\n\n458\n00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.950\nit could be why is this not working?\n\n459\n00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.010\nHere's my recommendation.\n\n460\n00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.990\nWhen you first start trying to use\nthe keyword this in appropriate context\n\n461\n00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.600\nalways make sure you know\nwhat this is referring to.\n\n462\n00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.200\nBecause in JavaScript,\nthis can change contexts.\n\n463\n00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.830\nEverywhere else, the this keyword\nmeans this counter object,\n\n464\n00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.630\nthis one particular one.\n\n465\n00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.082\nIn event listeners, what we will find.\n\n466\n00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:44.490\nIs the this keyword, in fact, changes.\n\n467\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:49.640\nIf I hit plus, notice this means\nthe button, what originated the event.\n\n468\n00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.160\nYou're like,\nwell that's weird change of behavior.\n\n469\n00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.000\nI don't want that.\n\n470\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.950\nI want it to be consistent.\n\n471\n00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.690\nI wanna use the this keyword to\nmean this object all the time.\n\n472\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.760\nWell, how do we fix that?\n\n473\n00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.570\nAnd sometimes you've got to go\nwith a little bit of magic and\n\n474\n00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.790\na little bit of hand waving.\n\n475\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.522\nAnd I do implore some verbal abuse.\n\n476\n00:26:07.522 --> 00:26:08.441\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n477\n00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:09.375\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not gonna lie there.\n\n478\n00:26:09.375 --> 00:26:13.602\nSometimes I'm like if you\ndon't work we're going to have\n\n479\n00:26:13.602 --> 00:26:14.948\nproblems\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n480\n00:26:14.948 --> 00:26:19.110\n&gt;&gt; So how do I fix that?\n\n481\n00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:25.130\nWell, up here at this.inc and this.dec.\n\n482\n00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:30.350\nThis is wiring up to these\nmethods on the object.\n\n483\n00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.570\nBut then when these are attached\nto an event listener handler,\n\n484\n00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.830\nthese are called handler functions.\n\n485\n00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.360\nThis does not mean the object.\n\n486\n00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.490\nBut instead,\nwhat originated for the event.\n\n487\n00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.501\nBut if I bind.\n\n488\n00:26:46.725 --> 00:26:52.440\nThis, the .bind will allow me\nto bind a different context.\n\n489\n00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.270\nWhat it means is change the meaning\nof this inside of this function.\n\n490\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:02.990\nAnd what it also means is, take the this\nthat's right here and pipe it in.\n\n491\n00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.990\nAnd we'll see how that has changed.\n\n492\n00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:12.120\nSo bind this, and you saw just a moment\nago that this referred to the button.\n\n493\n00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.046\nLet's see what this refers to now.\n\n494\n00:27:16.597 --> 00:27:21.740\nIt actually refers back to\nthe counter object as we anticipated.\n\n495\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.830\nAnd that's, yes I had this consistency.\n\n496\n00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.660\nNow there are valid performance concerns,\n\n497\n00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.270\nin the grand scope of things,\nof using .bind.\n\n498\n00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.610\nFor a small application like\nthis it's not a huge issue.\n\n499\n00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.320\nBut do keep in mind that the this keyword,\n\n500\n00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.430\nalthough powerful,\ncan be a sneaky, sneaky snake.\n\n501\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.249\nSo I have this refactored.\n\n502\n00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:50.920\nI personally thinks it looks\na lot more organized than this,\n\n503\n00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.590\neven though this was organized in nature.\n\n504\n00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.270\nDaniel, as non programmer, right, a non\nweb developer, what are your thoughts?\n\n505\n00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.810\nDoes it look more organized to you and\nit's perfectly okay, if you like.\n\n506\n00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:02.470\nNo.\n\n507\n00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:06.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I understand where people\nwould think, well, yeah, it's a lot more\n\n508\n00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.840\ncode so there's a lot more stuff that\nI'm having to discern what's happening.\n\n509\n00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.780\nSo in that sense it can seem like it's\nless organized where the simplicity\n\n510\n00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.210\nof the other style of code\nwas much easier to read.\n\n511\n00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:21.640\nBut when we start talking about that\nmaintainability and that functionality,\n\n512\n00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.710\nthat modularity of it, this is obviously\nbecause now I can actually use this\n\n513\n00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.560\nsomewhere else instead of just having my\nown little counter that I've created.\n\n514\n00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Exactly now I'm gonna do some\nhand-wavey use some JavaScript stuff\n\n515\n00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.660\nbecause I now have a second\nrequest from my boss.\n\n516\n00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.080\nI know you've refactored that but\nwe actually need two counters.\n\n517\n00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.570\nOn our website.\n\n518\n00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.476\nWell let's do this.\n\n519\n00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:50.160\nLet's create the second counter.\n\n520\n00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.960\nAnd that's going to be using\nthe object that I create.\n\n521\n00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.340\nAnd this is gonna make a copy or\nit should.\n\n522\n00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.710\nAnd then, I'm going to add.\n\n523\n00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.090\nJust a duplicate.\n\n524\n00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.780\nYou would not wanna,\nlike you wanna template this out so\n\n525\n00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.590\nyou can kind of move this around.\n\n526\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:11.261\nI'm gonna use this as a duplicate and\ncall this second.\n\n527\n00:29:14.111 --> 00:29:18.493\nAnd now I'm going to say second counter.\n\n528\n00:29:18.493 --> 00:29:24.160\nWell what,\nsee how we've hard-coded this in there?\n\n529\n00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.160\nThis would almost be better\nif this was a property,\n\n530\n00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.290\nright, that I could set on the app.\n\n531\n00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:35.260\nSo a little further refactor,\nand then I think we'll be good.\n\n532\n00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:40.004\nSo the element is going to be for\nthis one, #app.\n\n533\n00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:46.270\nAnd, then, I am going to change this to,\nthis time, element.\n\n534\n00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.860\nBut, now, I can modify that and\nwhen I call init, I have a separate app.\n\n535\n00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.930\nAnd we'll see that in just a moment, here,\nif everything goes according to plan.\n\n536\n00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.935\nSo, I can say element equals.\n\n537\n00:29:58.935 --> 00:30:01.697\nNot there.\n\n538\n00:30:01.697 --> 00:30:07.220\nSecond, so #second.\n\n539\n00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.342\nAnd I'm gonna say secondCounter.init.\n\n540\n00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:13.880\nAnd notice,\nI have this setup before I call init.\n\n541\n00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.360\nSo I can modify these properties and\nthen call init.\n\n542\n00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.320\nNow this is not exactly how\nI would implement this code.\n\n543\n00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:25.300\nI would do a further messing around so\nI could just give this argument and\n\n544\n00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.690\nthen the counter is produced with\nthat argument already in place.\n\n545\n00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:31.920\nBut, let's see if it works and if not.\n\n546\n00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.290\nI got a minus and I got a plus.\n\n547\n00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.050\nThere we go, I didn't click hard enough.\n\n548\n00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.410\n&gt;&gt; Force touch.\n\n549\n00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:39.940\n&gt;&gt; Force touch.\n\n550\n00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.428\nSo now, I have two independent counters.\n\n551\n00:30:42.428 --> 00:30:45.728\nThey're just duplicates\nof the same application.\n\n552\n00:30:47.258 --> 00:30:49.810\nThis is where the path,\nthis is four lines, right?\n\n553\n00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.020\nActually three lines added.\n\n554\n00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.950\nIn order to accomplish this,\nI would actually need to copy and\n\n555\n00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.520\npaste and\nstart doing crazy things like this.\n\n556\n00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:03.410\nCount1, element1, and\nI've seen people do that.\n\n557\n00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.640\nSomeone was like this application\nit's not quite working.\n\n558\n00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.650\nI was like cool well let me look at it and\nit's 700 lines of that exact thing.\n\n559\n00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.510\nI copy and pasted and then I added one,\ntwo, three, four, five, six, eight.\n\n560\n00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.430\nAnd you're like yeah you should not.\n\n561\n00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.640\nAny time you see yourself doing\nthat you should think there's\n\n562\n00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.470\nprobably a better way.\n\n563\n00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:28.810\nSo that is how I would go about\nrefactoring this, as a first pass.\n\n564\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.910\nYou will find that other people\nhave different opinions, but\n\n565\n00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.810\nI ask you to play around with this.\n\n566\n00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.808\nAnd there are further\nways to clean this up.\n\n567\n00:31:36.808 --> 00:31:42.090\nBut I've now given my boss what he wants.\n\n568\n00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.040\nIt's reproducible.\n\n569\n00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.610\nI can just move this between without\nworrying about namespace clashes.\n\n570\n00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:51.990\nAll I need is that little bit of html for\nthe mark up, and this object and\n\n571\n00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.530\nI'm good to go.\n\n572\n00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:56.400\n&gt;&gt; I kind of feel bad cuz I've actually\ndone that thing he was talking about where\n\n573\n00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.150\nhe's like yeah I'm gonna\nrecreate this thing but\n\n574\n00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.390\nit needs to be within the same program so\nI'll just copy and paste,\n\n575\n00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.740\nand start changing variable names,\nand things of that nature.\n\n576\n00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:09.625\n&gt;&gt; Well Daniel I will tell you,\nI'm gonna say that I've done that as well.\n\n577\n00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:12.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But this was a pain point that I felt.\n\n578\n00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.810\nI was like there has to be a better\nway other than copying and pasting.\n\n579\n00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.051\nAnd sometimes if you just want to see\nif something works, don't get me wrong,\n\n580\n00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:21.636\nI still copy and paste and go, [SOUND].\n\n581\n00:32:21.636 --> 00:32:26.070\nBecause my editor allows me to\nchange names and stuff very quickly.\n\n582\n00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.200\nSo I'm like, okay, it works.\n\n583\n00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.090\nNow let me go figure out how\nto make that reproducible,\n\n584\n00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.560\nmore maintainable instead\nof 9,000 lines of.\n\n585\n00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:37.250\nThis is just the same app,\ncopy and pasted like 600 times.\n\n586\n00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:38.980\nSo don't worry, Daniel, everybody does it.\n\n587\n00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm in good company.\n\n588\n00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:40.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, awesome.\n\n589\n00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, that being said,\nit's been a great look into refactoring,\n\n590\n00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.650\nvery cool, it's a good idea, right, it's\nthe idea of, yeah, I've made something and\n\n591\n00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:54.480\nit works but now I need to make it\nto where everybody can reuse this.\n\n592\n00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.580\nI can give this to Justin,\nJustin can give his app to me.\n\n593\n00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.450\nAnd I can go, great, I got a program\nthat would be perfect to work with.\n\n594\n00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.450\nAnd I just bolt it right onto that\ncode and it all starts to work.\n\n595\n00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:08.950\nSo that refactoring idea is something you\ndefinitely want to start striving to make\n\n596\n00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:11.530\npart of your methodology of creating code.\n\n597\n00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.760\nYeah, you bang it out, it gets to working.\n\n598\n00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.490\nAnd now let's make it\na little more elegant.\n\n599\n00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:17.790\nLet's make it a little more useful.\n\n600\n00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.270\nThat being said, Justin it looks like\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n601\n00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:21.630\nBut we thank you for stopping by.\n\n602\n00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.580\nIs there anything else that we need to\ndrop on our audience there before we\n\n603\n00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.390\nwalk away?\n\n604\n00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, I will tell you, that has, my\nbrain is hurting just to explaining it so\n\n605\n00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:31.760\nI think we're good today.\n\n606\n00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.410\nBut I think we're gonna see some more\ninteresting things as the series rolls on.\n\n607\n00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.820\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, looking forward to that.\n\n608\n00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.660\nLooking forward to seeing you guys\nthere as well but it is that time for\n\n609\n00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.930\nus to sign off.\n\n610\n00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.680\nSo for\nITProtv I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n611\n00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n612\n00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.772\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n613\n00:33:52.182 --> 00:33:55.268\n[MUSIC]\n\n614\n00:33:55.268 --> 00:33:59.134\n&gt;&gt; Thank

00:00:11.996\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:13.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.860\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.000\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, that's right,\n\n7\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.860\nwe're back with more on our\nintro to web development.\n\n8\n00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.370\nAnd joining us again in the studio\nour good friend, our mentor,\n\n9\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.610\nour guiding star in this endeavor, Mr.\nJustin Dennison.\n\n10\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.770\nJustin, welcome back,\nmy man, how goes it today?\n\n11\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.850\n&gt;&gt; It goes well.\nI feel\n\n12\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.300\nlike you've oversold my\nintroduction there a little bit.\n\n13\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.110\nGuiding star, I'm like yes.\n\n14\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.360\n&gt;&gt; We're looking to you.\n\n15\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.301\n&gt;&gt; Why yes, I am.\n\n16\n00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:40.828\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you Daniel,\n\n17\n00:00:40.828 --> 00:00:41.499\nhow are you today?\n\n18\n00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:42.428\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, thanks.\n\n19\n00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:43.358\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, awesome.\n\n20\n00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:46.286\nSo, yeah we're back into\nweb development and\n\n21\n00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:50.793\nwe're gonna build something again and\nI'm wanna take this approach of\n\n22\n00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:55.751\nbuilding things while hitting this nuance\nbehaviors because is always good to\n\n23\n00:00:55.751 --> 00:01:00.330\nsee this in a context of how I\nwould use this in real life, right?\n\n24\n00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.250\nIf I just showed you document.query\nselector or just creating objects all\n\n25\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.460\nthe time you go Well that's nice,\nhow would I actually use that?\n\n26\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.110\nWell that's my goal with these series.\n\n27\n00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.720\nIs how would I use this to build\nsomething small and simple?\n\n28\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.940\nNow I keep these projects\nvery simple in nature.\n\n29\n00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.470\nWell you'll find out sometimes they're not\nas simple as you would hope them to be.\n\n30\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.390\nBecause I want you to focus on\nthe building pieces, the building blocks.\n\n31\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.520\nHow we put these things together\nto achieve a goal and not so\n\n32\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.470\nmuch with getting bog down with, ahh, I\njust spent forty minutes trying to figure\n\n33\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.950\nout how to create a log in form that\nactually sends a log in request.\n\n34\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.400\nAnd then I had to go and\nfigure out how to.\n\n35\n00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.590\nThat's not our goal here, this is intro.\n\n36\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.650\nHow do I take these little pieces of\nknowledge that I have, events, right?\n\n37\n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.050\nInteracting with the DAM,\nWindows are, browser objects.\n\n38\n00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.960\nKind of unifying those\ninto an application.\n\n39\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.260\nAnd these small widget type applications\nare typically where people start and\n\n40\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.890\nas you get better at these you're like,\nwoah what if I can add feature a or\n\n41\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.040\nfeature b or feature c and\nthat's where I recommend to kind\n\n42\n00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.070\nof start out on your own, is take\nsomething base and make it better, right?\n\n43\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.200\nThink of it as a minimum\nproduct of what you want.\n\n44\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.840\nAnd in that vein, today we're I use this\ntechnique called the Pomodoro Technique\n\n45\n00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.310\nwhere I work for 25 minutes.\n\n46\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.760\nI'll take a break for 5 minutes.\n\n47\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.080\nI work another 25 minutes.\n\n48\n00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.820\nI'll take a 5 minute break.\n\n49\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.770\nI work another 25 minutes,\nthen I take a 15 minute break.\n\n50\n00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.410\nAnd I do that cycle just to get up,\nstretch, get the blood flowing,\n\n51\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.330\ntake my mind off of what I'm doing\nbecause we have a tendency to go,\n\n52\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.460\nI'm going to conquer this.\n\n53\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.370\nAnd then you just kinda spin your wheels.\n\n54\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.270\nSome of the best ideas that\nI have is that five-minute,\n\n55\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.270\njust kind of walk around the office one\ntime and come back to your computer.\n\n56\n00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.258\nWell, I thought about that and\n\n57\n00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:52.551\nthis is a perfect project to think\nabout those processes, right?\n\n58\n00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:57.491\nTaking those breaks, the thought process,\nas well as something to build but\n\n59\n00:02:57.491 --> 00:03:02.369\nI don't want to keep the break channel,\nI just want to be able to time stuff.\n\n60\n00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.191\nI just want the 25 minutes.\n\n61\n00:03:04.191 --> 00:03:09.390\nThat's where we're gonna start,\nnow notice I took 25, 5, 25, 5, 25, 15.\n\n62\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.210\nThat cycle.\n\n63\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.980\nThat's actually a lot of\ndecision making that goes on,\n\n64\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.080\nand I reduced its complexity to,\nit's gonna count for 25 minutes.\n\n65\n00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.230\nThat's all it's going to do.\n\n66\n00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.850\nWe're starting that simple.\n\n67\n00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.570\nAnd then after our refactor\nwe'll actually see,\n\n68\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.920\nokay now I want to add that feature\nwhere I can count for five minutes.\n\n69\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.650\nI want to go on a break.\n\n70\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.170\nAnd now I want to see how many cycles\nI have and take that 15 minute break.\n\n71\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.530\nAnd I want to emphasis that I\nam starting a minimum idea.\n\n72\n00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.080\nWhat is the minimum that gets\nacross that have I a counter, or\n\n73\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.890\nexcuse me a timer, and\nthen make that a full fledged timer.\n\n74\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.520\nSo that's what we're going to do, and\n\n75\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.300\nI think the best way to actually get that\nstarted is to get our project set up so\n\n76\n00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.000\nwe're going to hop down\ninto our computer here.\n\n77\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.820\nBut for some reason,\nI said hop down in our computer, and\n\n78\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.300\nI just imagine a tiny little me shrinking\nonscreen and hopping into the computer.\n\n79\n00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.832\n&gt;&gt; Like something straight out of the 80s,\nright?\n\n80\n00:04:04.832 --> 00:04:06.531\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:10.660\nSo, I have this folder,\nI need to create a new project folder.\n\n82\n00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.190\nAnd i'm just gonna call it timer, right?\n\n83\n00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.880\nI'm not making the commitment\nto that Pomodoro technique,\n\n84\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.440\nright now it is just a simple timer.\n\n85\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.580\nAnd we're gonna learn a few new JavaScript\nthings along the way that help us because\n\n86\n00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.140\nJavaScript makes this happen a little bit\ndifferently than some other languages.\n\n87\n00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.160\nSo I have my timer and\nI wanna open that in Atom.\n\n88\n00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.640\nBecause I'm wanna build this\nfile structure in Atom.\n\n89\n00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.740\nSo I'm gonna add a project folder and come\nout to my Timer application here, open.\n\n90\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.034\nAnd then we need a couple of files.\n\n91\n00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:46.314\nWe need our app.js, our standard\nentry point for our JavaScript, and\n\n92\n00:04:46.314 --> 00:04:47.220\nour index.html.\n\n93\n00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.720\nSo let's go ahead and make those.\n\n94\n00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.800\nNot a new folder,\nthat's a common error in Atom, by the way.\n\n95\n00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.660\nPeople accidentally click New Folder and\nmake a index.html folder.\n\n96\n00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.170\nAnd then things are broke and\nyou're like what's going on?\n\n97\n00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.610\nSo I need index study HTML.\n\n98\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.230\nAnd I need an app.js.\n\n99\n00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.470\nAlright, there's our two files.\n\n100\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.680\nAnd while we're here, let's go ahead and\nfill out just a standard HTML here.\n\n101\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.950\nAnd if I, and if I type HTML enter\nthen it'll fill that out and\n\n102\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.010\nwe'll just call this a timer.\n\n103\n00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.690\nAnd right before the end of\nthe body I'm going to insert\n\n104\n00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.260\nmy script which runs my app.js.\n\n105\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.500\nSo I'm good to go but\nI am gonna add something to my app.js here\n\n106\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.240\njust to make sure that\neverything is working.\n\n107\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.070\nThat's right and I've said this before,I\ntend to do this very minor detail or\n\n108\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.250\nany things over and over and\nover again and what I found is people,they\n\n109\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.345\nahh I don't need that now and they will\nbuild an application,they go to refresh\n\n110\n00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:54.140\nit,it doesn't work and what they\nforgot is in fact the script tag and\n\n111\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.610\nthey are like yeah I forgot that so if we\ndo this one step at a time,incrementally.\n\n112\n00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.150\nWe don't have to worry\nabout whoopsie daisy.\n\n113\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.392\nSo if I hope over into my browser,\nI'm gonna open that index.html.\n\n114\n00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:11.774\n[SOUND] And here we go,\nwe have our timer, and\n\n115\n00:06:11.774 --> 00:06:15.100\nwe have index.html and we open.\n\n116\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.510\nAnd then as always, I'm gonna go ahead and\nhop into the dev tools.\n\n117\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.150\nCuz your dev tools are your friend and\nnotice I already have working\n\n118\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.530\nright there and that means that well\nit's working, so we're good to go.\n\n119\n00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.860\nNow I'm gonna emphasize that I'm\nnot gonna do a lot of styling here.\n\n120\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.030\nI'm worried more about the layout and the\ninteraction and maybe we can come back and\n\n121\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.970\ndo styling later we'll see.\n\n122\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.360\nDepends on whether we have time or not.\n\n123\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.220\nAs a result this will probably be\nblown up really big in your face,\n\n124\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.800\nbut let's go ahead and\nget started on the layout.\n\n125\n00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.460\nSo on the layout I'm going to\ncreate a DIV called container,\n\n126\n00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.830\nand this is in preparation for\nmaybe I want to style this In some way,\n\n127\n00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.610\nand then I'm gonna create another div\nwith the id of timer inside of that.\n\n128\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.380\nThis is actually our application, our\nlittle widget, our module, so to speak.\n\n129\n00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.950\nAnd within that, I'm gonna use this\nsection tag, because I want this section\n\n130\n00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.850\nto be well, I want it to be separate\nfrom another section within the timer.\n\n131\n00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.010\nSo, this section is going to\nhave the class of displaying,\n\n132\n00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.650\nnotice I put a dot there, and that creates\na class and atom when you hit tab,\n\n133\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:36.990\nand then span of minutes and\nthen I'm going to create another span.\n\n134\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:45.970\nIt is only gonna have the column name and\nthen a span of seconds.\n\n135\n00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.740\nNotice that I have hold this apart.\n\n136\n00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.265\nI was saying to myself how do\nbest get this time kind of.\n\n137\n00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:54.169\nI wanna keep tracking time.\n\n138\n00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:58.170\nOr if any 25 minutes I need\nsomewhere to record minutes.\n\n139\n00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:03.114\nAnd seconds, so, instead of trying\nto do all this string manipulation,\n\n140\n00:08:03.114 --> 00:08:07.276\nin my layout, I just have two\ndifferent parts of the display.\n\n141\n00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:12.820\nNotice I'm in the section display and\ninside of that I have minutes and seconds.\n\n142\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.974\nThis will not render any differently\non the page for me it's what it is.\n\n143\n00:08:18.974 --> 00:08:21.810\nI'm using this to say I am\nsectioning up my application.\n\n144\n00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.427\nThis is called a semantic HTML\ntag that helps me know when\n\n145\n00:08:26.427 --> 00:08:30.367\nI read my HTML what my\nmeaning is it is a section.\n\n146\n00:08:30.367 --> 00:08:30.960\nWhat is it?\n\n147\n00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.446\nIt is the display it has a minutes and\na seconds.\n\n148\n00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:39.440\nWell that's awesome, so\nwhat about the other part?\n\n149\n00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.520\nWell, if I want the 25 minutes, I think\n\n150\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.360\nthe only two operations that I\nreally want are to start and stop.\n\n151\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.580\nAnd every time,\nI'm just gonna run 25 minutes.\n\n152\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.290\nAnd then I can count the 5 minute\nbreak initially by myself, you know,\n\n153\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.079\nI can approximate it.\n\n154\n00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.996\nBut we're gonna leave some room so\nwe can go back and add some features.\n\n155\n00:09:01.996 --> 00:09:10.950\nSo in the section of controls I'm gonna\ncreate a button with a class of start.\n\n156\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.830\nAnd button, and I'm just gonna say Start.\n\n157\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:21.950\nAnd I'm also gonna create another button\nwith a class of stop and button and stop.\n\n158\n00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.688\nSo these are the only two interactions\nthat I'm gonna have for now and\n\n159\n00:09:26.688 --> 00:09:28.738\nactually our layout is done.\n\n160\n00:09:28.738 --> 00:09:33.723\nNow by segmenting this up,\nnotice that these classes actually don't\n\n161\n00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:37.860\nmean much to me now, but\nlike display and controls.\n\n162\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.326\nBy segmenting those up, I now have\nthe ability to say well the controls\n\n163\n00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:44.458\nare gonna look like this,\nthe display is gonna look like this.\n\n164\n00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:47.620\nAnd, I have kind of a namespace, right?\n\n165\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:53.080\nIf I had another minutes over here, Right,\n\n166\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:59.250\nthen what would I have, well, I could look\ninside of display and find its minutes.\n\n167\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.440\nBut I could also look for\nminutes on other parts of the application\n\n168\n00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.790\nwithout having that\ncollision that can occur.\n\n169\n00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.280\nBut we don't need that,\nit's no good for us.\n\n170\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.610\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo a little bit of planning, so\n\n171\n00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.240\nwe need data, and\nmaybe some initial variable declarations.\n\n172\n00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.420\nWe also need to cache the DOM.\n\n173\n00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.390\nYou will see a very kind of repetitive\nnature in my thought process.\n\n174\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.020\nAnd it's what works for me,\nmaybe it's not what works for you.\n\n175\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.970\nI find that boiling this down\nto set of these minor little\n\n176\n00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.350\nnibbles that I need to take care of\nallows me to be incredibly productive\n\n177\n00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.270\neven though it is somewhat\nrepetitive at times.\n\n178\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.760\nNow as your application grows,\nyou might have to break outside of this.\n\n179\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.795\nBut I'm gonna cache the DOM, and\nthen I'm gonna add listeners.\n\n180\n00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:59.360\nAnd finally the rest of it is gonna\nbe all my function definitions.\n\n181\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:06.558\nAnd I'm gonna have some\ninitialization all right?\n\n182\n00:11:06.558 --> 00:11:10.760\nSo, data and variables, lets think\nabout what kind of data we need.\n\n183\n00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.330\nSo there's two ways to go about this.\n\n184\n00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.540\nI can keep track of seconds and\nminutes separately.\n\n185\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.370\nSo, I could count down the minutes, and\n\n186\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.580\nthen I have all this decision\nmaking that I have to do.\n\n187\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.470\nBut really if I think about this really,\nreally really hard,\n\n188\n00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.130\nthen minutes are actually just\na different unit for seconds.\n\n189\n00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.430\nI can take five minutes, and\nturn that into 300 seconds.\n\n190\n00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.400\nSo if I have five minutes and\nfive seconds, that's actually 305 seconds.\n\n191\n00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.450\nDid I do that math right?\n\n192\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.140\nYeah, I think I did.\n\n193\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.550\nSo, if that's the case, then really I only\nneed to keep track of one piece of data,\n\n194\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.120\nand that's actually the number of seconds.\n\n195\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.210\nSo, what do I need to do?\n\n196\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.880\nI need a conversion factor.\n\n197\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:12:00.470\nThat is a perfect time For a constant.\n\n198\n00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.580\nRight, I don't want to\naccidentally reassign seconds and\n\n199\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.890\nminutes to anything else.\n\n200\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.750\nSo, I'm gonna make that a constant.\n\n201\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.020\nNow, what else do we have here?\n\n202\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.080\nWell, I know that if I think about\na timer it kinda ticks away, right?\n\n203\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.810\nOkay what else do we need?\n\n204\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:23.660\nI don't know if I need that ticker yet.\n\n205\n00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.440\nBut, I do need a way\nto keep track of time,\n\n206\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.360\nand I'm gonna say time left,\nat that number of seconds that is left.\n\n207\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.780\n305 seconds would be 5 minutes and 5\nseconds and that's going to be, well let's\n\n208\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:42.980\nsay 25 times the seconds and\nminutes plus zero.\n\n209\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.232\nNow the zero's not really important but\nthat would be minutes\n\n210\n00:12:50.156 --> 00:12:55.020\nAs seconds plus the seconds.\n\n211\n00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.460\nRight so I've converted whatever\nminutes there are 25 And\n\n212\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.100\nconverted those to seconds.\n\n213\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.080\nAnd for\nnow that may be all the data that I need.\n\n214\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.210\nWe have some decision making but\nwe should probably go ahead and\n\n215\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.000\nmaybe move forward in our application.\n\n216\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.110\nWhat you will find is I may have\nto come back and add some data or\n\n217\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.030\nvariables as I need them but that's okay.\n\n218\n00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:22.850\nSince I had them segmented up I still have\nsome organization that allows me to go,\n\n219\n00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:23.810\nwhere did I name add data?\n\n220\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.080\nYeah the first thing.\n\n221\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.540\nSo, I need to Cache the DOM.\n\n222\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.310\nWell I don't want any\naccidental reassignment,\n\n223\n00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.810\nso what DOM elements do I need to cache?\n\n224\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.565\nWell I actually need display minutes,\ndisplay seconds,\n\n225\n00:13:38.565 --> 00:13:43.620\nthe display the control start and\ncontrol stop.\n\n226\n00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.839\nSo okay, I'm just gonna get display and\n\n227\n00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:52.010\nthen document.query selector and\n\n228\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.730\njust as a reminder there is another\nway to make this selection.\n\n229\n00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.270\nSo, this is a class so\nI'm gonna use the class selector\n\n230\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.930\nI could use get elements by class name and\nthen find the first one, right?\n\n231\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.080\nBecause that will give me a collection.\n\n232\n00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.150\nBut since I'm saying query\nselector with no all,\n\n233\n00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.580\nI'm guaranteed to get\nthe first one on the page.\n\n234\n00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.750\nAnd don't call this class.\n\n235\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.270\nActually, call it\nthe class that it is named.\n\n236\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:22.298\nAnd I'm gonna say controls\ndocument.querySelector,\n\n237\n00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.361\nAnd .controls.\n\n238\n00:14:27.361 --> 00:14:32.331\nAll right, now some people who\nare really versed in CSS may be\n\n239\n00:14:32.331 --> 00:14:35.857\nscreaming at the television a little bit.\n\n240\n00:14:35.857 --> 00:14:40.516\nOr your screen or your web app, you know\nyour web interface keep in mind this is\n\n241\n00:14:40.516 --> 00:14:43.669\nabout learning,\nthis is about thought processes,\n\n242\n00:14:43.669 --> 00:14:47.460\nnot necessarily always\nabout minor best practices.\n\n243\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.840\nAgain, there's a multitude\nof ways to do this.\n\n244\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.110\nFind your way.\n\n245\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.270\nNow, if I need the start button,\nwhere am I going to find that?\n\n246\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.269\nWell, I'm actually going\nto find that in controls.\n\n247\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.460\nAnd I want the thing with the class\nof start and stop button.\n\n248\n00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.080\nThat is going to be in controls as well.\n\n249\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.080\nAnd notice I'm no longer\nsearching the entire document,\n\n250\n00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.450\nI'm sequestering my search to\njust the controls portion.\n\n251\n00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:23.830\nAnd for me that helps my like\nthe segmenting of individual pieces and\n\n252\n00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.230\nI have my stop button.\n\n253\n00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.120\nNow, what about the display?\n\n254\n00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.364\nWell, I need the minutes and that's gonna\n\n255\n00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:38.193\nbe in display.querySelector.minutes, and\n\n256\n00:15:38.193 --> 00:15:45.638\nthen const seconds equals\ndisplay queryselector seconds.\n\n257\n00:15:45.638 --> 00:15:48.184\nAll right so\nthat's a lot of Dom cashing but\n\n258\n00:15:48.184 --> 00:15:50.743\nI don't want to do this\nlook up every time.\n\n259\n00:15:50.743 --> 00:15:54.035\nBecause what will happen is,\nif I do this dynamically,\n\n260\n00:15:54.035 --> 00:15:58.990\nevery time I click the button I have\nto look for minutes and seconds.\n\n261\n00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.389\nWell- This will search\nthe entire document.\n\n262\n00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:04.775\nWhich is not a huge deal here,\nbut if I have a blog or\n\n263\n00:16:04.775 --> 00:16:08.163\na social media application\nthat I'm working on or\n\n264\n00:16:08.163 --> 00:16:13.590\nsomething like a corporate application\nwere their managing assets.\n\n265\n00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.750\nThat may cause a significant slow down.\n\n266\n00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:20.160\nSo if you can do not\ndynamically search the Dom.\n\n267\n00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.130\nBecause it's just helpful\nit keeps thinks static.\n\n268\n00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.270\nWith that in mind, there are times\nwhere there's no way around it.\n\n269\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:31.660\nYou gotta search the dom dynamically, as\nlong as you're not getting crazy with it.\n\n270\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.430\nNow, what about listeners?\n\n271\n00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.330\nWhat listeners do I need?\n\n272\n00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.240\nWhat's the only things that\nI'm gonna interact with?\n\n273\n00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.120\nWell, my start and my stop button,\nthat's my clicks, right?\n\n274\n00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:49.322\nSo, start Button.addEventListener and\n\n275\n00:16:49.322 --> 00:16:55.530\nI'm gonna listen for a click,\nand what is my start button.\n\n276\n00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.950\nWell, its actually going\nthrough run start, right?\n\n277\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.420\nIts going to start up the application.\n\n278\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.280\nAnd then stopButton is\ngoing to addEventListener.\n\n279\n00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:08.790\nAnd what is it going to do?\n\n280\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.940\nWell, it's going to stop.\n\n281\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.540\nAnd right now I will have those wired up,\nbut this is gonna fail because start and\n\n282\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.780\nstop are not defined.\n\n283\n00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:21.590\nSo what I find myself doing,\nis just making empty functions\n\n284\n00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.930\nbecause I don't wanna stop my\nthought process on this checklist.\n\n285\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.070\nBut I wanna fill these in so I no longer\nhave those errors that will pop up and\n\n286\n00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.190\ngo, start is not defined.\n\n287\n00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.430\nYou're like, I know,\nI'll figure it out later.\n\n288\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.240\nAnd then, let's add some white space here.\n\n289\n00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:39.730\nSo, here we go.\n\n290\n00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.120\nWhat about initialization?\n\n291\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.740\nWhat do I need to do?\n\n292\n00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.280\nWell I've cached the dom,\nI've added my listeners.\n\n293\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.490\nI need to render one time.\n\n294\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.320\nAnd what is that render gonna do?\n\n295\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.950\nWell, I think that's probably\nthe first thing we need to tackle.\n\n296\n00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.439\nSo we're gonna make this render function.\n\n297\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.100\nAnd if everything is good,\nwe can refresh, and unexpected token.\n\n298\n00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.270\nRender, you\n\n299\n00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.860\nactually have to use appropriate\nsyntax with the function keyword.\n\n300\n00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.390\nGets me sometimes, sometimes.\n\n301\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.400\nSo if I refresh, there's nothing there.\n\n302\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.652\nAnd I'm gonna zoom these in.\n\n303\n00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:23.640\nThere we are,and notice I have the colon\nbut I have no minutes and seconds.\n\n304\n00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.637\nAnd that's because the first\nrender has not occurred, right?\n\n305\n00:18:26.637 --> 00:18:29.650\nSo we need to do this so that we\nhave an appropriate initialization.\n\n306\n00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.680\nSo what does render do?\n\n307\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:39.260\nWell, if I have time left, if I can\nsomehow pull away the minutes part.\n\n308\n00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.810\nAnd then pull away the seconds part.\n\n309\n00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.540\nI can then update minutes and\nseconds with the respective values.\n\n310\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.460\nNow if you're like well,\n\n311\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.490\nwhy are you pulling them apart if\nyou're gonna keep them together?\n\n312\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.000\nAnd this time left,\nas just a count of seconds,\n\n313\n00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.120\nmakes some of our other logic easier,\nnot necessarily the render as easy.\n\n314\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.440\nNow the render's still fairly easy.\n\n315\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.480\nSo if I want to,\nI can get the minutes left.\n\n316\n00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.720\nAnd what is that?\n\n317\n00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.249\nThat's gonna be the time left.\n\n318\n00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:14.540\nAnd if I divide by minutes or\n\n319\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.089\na seconds in minutes.\n\n320\n00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.030\nWhat did I get?\nSeconds and minutes, okay?\n\n321\n00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.720\nIs that gonna give me\nthe number of minutes?\n\n322\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.510\nSo if I divide by the seconds and\nminutes, so if I divide by 60,\n\n323\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.530\nthat should give me the number of minutes.\n\n324\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:40.400\nAnd then if I want secondsLeft,\nIt is the timeLeft percent.\n\n325\n00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.370\nWhat is percent?\n\n326\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.240\nThat's what's remaining, the remaining\noperator, also known as modulus.\n\n327\n00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.610\nBut if I ever want the whole number that's\nremaining, I want to divide it up into\n\n328\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:55.200\nequal division, and then whatever's left\nover, I can use the modulus operator and\n\n329\n00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.610\nI can mod seconds and minutes also.\n\n330\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.460\nSo, I'm pulling it out into the hole and\nthe remaining.\n\n331\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:12.864\nAnd then, the render is going\nto say minutes.textContent\n\n332\n00:20:12.864 --> 00:20:16.630\n= minutesLeft.\n\n333\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:23.000\nAnd then seconds,\ntextContent = secondsLeft.\n\n334\n00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.570\nAll right.\n\n335\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.508\nIf we've done it right,\nwe should see 25 : 00.\n\n336\n00:20:26.508 --> 00:20:27.846\nLet's go check it out.\n\n337\n00:20:27.846 --> 00:20:34.629\nIf we refresh, It's close, it's close.\n\n338\n00:20:34.629 --> 00:20:36.480\nI got 25 : 0.\n\n339\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.880\nI wonder if, I'm getting some weird stuff.\n\n340\n00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.810\nSo I'm actually gonna print out,\nthese two.\n\n341\n00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.210\nThat is not how you spell console.\n\n342\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.110\n&gt;&gt; That's not even a word.\n\n343\n00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not even a word.\n\n344\n00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.100\nThat is not a word.\n\n345\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.660\nSo I'm going to print\nout these two values,\n\n346\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.420\njust to make sure everything\nis on the up and up.\n\n347\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.130\nNow I do have 25 and 0, 0.\n\n348\n00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:01.007\nNow, I know that this is an even,\n\n349\n00:21:01.007 --> 00:21:06.590\nwhat if I change this to 24 and 59.\n\n350\n00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:11.003\nI'm trying to see the problems that\nI'm going to run into, because okay,\n\n351\n00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:15.138\nI'm dividing, but JavaScript should\ndo floating point division and\n\n352\n00:21:15.138 --> 00:21:19.810\nnot give me whole numbers like that so\neasily so I should be careful.\n\n353\n00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:20.730\nSo I refresh.\n\n354\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.310\nThat's a weird time remaining there.\n\n355\n00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.170\nThat's not what I want.\n\n356\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.930\nI actually want just the first part,\nthe thing before the decimal.\n\n357\n00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.980\nI want to bring this down to zero.\n\n358\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.200\nSo how do I do that?\n\n359\n00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.990\nPart of JavaScript,\n\n360\n00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:41.210\nyou have this math module that\nhas some common math functions.\n\n361\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.240\nAnd I'm gonna take the floor.\n\n362\n00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.110\nAnd what the floor does is\nessentially [SOUND] lop\n\n363\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.379\noff the decimal portion of\na floating point number.\n\n364\n00:21:50.379 --> 00:21:53.980\nSo if we've done that correctly,\nwe have 24 and 59.\n\n365\n00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.000\nBut I also have another issue\nthat cropped up, as we just saw.\n\n366\n00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.168\nIf I go back to 00\n[SOUND] I don't have 00,\n\n367\n00:22:04.168 --> 00:22:08.260\nI wonder what if I make it in 7 seconds,\n\n368\n00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.855\nI bet that'll, that'll probably fix it.\n\n369\n00:22:12.855 --> 00:22:15.520\nAnd notice there is ambiguity here, right?\n\n370\n00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.650\nIs it 25 minutes and 70 seconds?\n\n371\n00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.480\nWhy isn't that 26 minutes and 10 seconds?\n\n372\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.100\nAnything less than ten, nine and\n\n373\n00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.330\nbelow, will not have that padding.\n\n374\n00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.490\nIt won't be padded by a zero.\n\n375\n00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.780\nSo we should probably go ahead and\nfix that before we get into\n\n376\n00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.620\nadding more logic because now\nwould be a good time to fix it.\n\n377\n00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.140\n&gt;&gt; Now is that like a built-in\nfeature that we can fix this with or\n\n378\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.870\nare we gonna have to build that padding,\nto say, I want a zero before it.\n\n379\n00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.570\nOnce you get to nine, add a zero to\nthe beginning to this, and work that out.\n\n380\n00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:51.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, Daniel, I'm here to tell you,\nthis is all up to us.\n\n381\n00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.950\nThere are a couple of ways\nto make these fixed length.\n\n382\n00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.100\nI find them to be weird to work with,\n\n383\n00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.760\nso I'm actually going to\n&gt;&gt; And you still have to build logic.\n\n384\n00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.668\nSo let's just build our own, right?\n\n385\n00:23:03.668 --> 00:23:07.660\nAll right, so we need to add\na function to help with our render.\n\n386\n00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.280\nWe could do all of this\nlogic inside a render, but\n\n387\n00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.860\nwhat if I want to use that\npadding somewhere else?\n\n388\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.290\nWhen I stop and restart,\n\n389\n00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:18.500\nwhat if I I forgot,\nit needs to somethings not working right.\n\n390\n00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.920\nSo we're gonna build this\nas a separate function.\n\n391\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.430\nAnd I'm gonna call this pad.\n\n392\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:30.510\nAnd all it's expecting is a number and\nit's gonna return something.\n\n393\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:34.970\nNow I know in the context of\nminutes left and seconds left.\n\n394\n00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:35.610\nThese are numbers.\n\n395\n00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.750\nBut when I put them into\nthe dump they become strings.\n\n396\n00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.580\nSo it's okay.\n\n397\n00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.880\nIf I make them stings during this portion.\n\n398\n00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.549\nAnd for padding, if you're trying\nto put two characters together,\n\n399\n00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:50.720\nputting a zero in front of\na number doesn't actually work.\n\n400\n00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.596\nAnd can actually cause some weirdness\nin some browser implementations.\n\n401\n00:23:54.596 --> 00:23:58.683\nIf this means, if I'm not mistaken,\nin some, don't quote me on this,\n\n402\n00:23:58.683 --> 00:24:00.363\nI'm recalling from memory.\n\n403\n00:24:00.363 --> 00:24:05.017\nAnd some browsers implementations this\nmeans octal, so in the octal base instead\n\n404\n00:24:05.017 --> 00:24:10.090\nof decimal, so this would be not the\nnumber seven as you would expect it to be.\n\n405\n00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.228\nIf we go and refresh,\nyou'll notice this browser implementation.\n\n406\n00:24:13.228 --> 00:24:16.772\nI think, they try to make that where you\nhave to do a little bit more than just put\n\n407\n00:24:16.772 --> 00:24:18.840\na number in front it, or\na zero in front of it.\n\n408\n00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.807\nBut, it does not persist\nbecause the zero seven and\n\n409\n00:24:21.807 --> 00:24:25.050\nthe number seven as numbers\nare exactly the same thing.\n\n410\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.370\nSo, how are we gonna fix that?\n\n411\n00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.390\nWell if the number that\nwe're given in pad,\n\n412\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.070\nwe're just thinking about pad,\nwhat do we want to do?\n\n413\n00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.190\nWell, if the number is less than 10,\nwe wanna do something.\n\n414\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.090\nOtherwise, we wanna do something else.\n\n415\n00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.660\nRight?\n\n416\n00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.539\nSo, this is our pad function.\n\n417\n00:24:46.539 --> 00:24:50.190\nWell if it's less than 10,\nI want to have it spit out.\n\n418\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:54.630\nAgain, we have to use strings,\ncuz we don't have any other options.\n\n419\n00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:58.004\nI could use a string like this.\n\n420\n00:24:58.004 --> 00:25:04.770\nNotice that 0 plus,\nI'm appending a 0 to the front of it.\n\n421\n00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.660\nYou know, it's not immediately\nclear what's going on here.\n\n422\n00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.700\nSo I'm gonna use some new ES 6 features.\n\n423\n00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.315\nSo a new version of JavaScript, and\n\n424\n00:25:14.315 --> 00:25:19.202\nI'm gonna say 0 Num.\n\n425\n00:25:19.202 --> 00:25:22.230\nAnd be very, very careful here,\nthese are back ticks.\n\n426\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.230\nThese are right below\nthe ESC key on your keyboard.\n\n427\n00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.740\nIt has the little tilde on it also.\n\n428\n00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.870\nSo what this will do is\ntake the value of num and\n\n429\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.310\nreplace this entire expression\nwith whatever comes in, okay?\n\n430\n00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.150\nWhat do I want if it's not less than 10?\n\n431\n00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:43.180\nWell, we just saw if it's not\nless than 10, everything is good.\n\n432\n00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.960\nSo I just wanna return num.\n\n433\n00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:50.820\nOkay, so don't worry about changing it,\nright, giving me a new value.\n\n434\n00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.640\nIf it's not less than ten,\njust spit it back out.\n\n435\n00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.670\nSo where are we gonna use this?\n\n436\n00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.099\nI'm going to pad, or our spotlight search.\n\n437\n00:26:00.099 --> 00:26:01.160\nAlso works.\n\n438\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.430\nI'm going to pad minutesLeft and\nsecondsLeft.\n\n439\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.980\nAnd I'm doing this in anticipation,\nbecause I want this uniformity.\n\n440\n00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.310\nI'll always want to get\na padded number to the left.\n\n441\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.880\nIf you decide that once minutes get to\nnine you no longer need that digit,\n\n442\n00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.650\njust leave off the pad.\n\n443\n00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.046\nIf I refresh, I now have 25:07.\n\n444\n00:26:22.046 --> 00:26:24.770\nWe're yeah, yeah.\n\n445\n00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.880\nSo, our pad function is\nhelping with our render.\n\n446\n00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.630\nAnd this is just we have\na single responsibility.\n\n447\n00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.760\nI don't render it to\nalso be padding numbers.\n\n448\n00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.690\nI want it to render.\n\n449\n00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.380\nThat's all I want it to do.\n\n450\n00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.980\nNow here's where it gets a little tricky.\n\n451\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:45.610\nI need to start up this\nactual like the timer, right?\n\n452\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:51.250\nSo, I think we have enough time to\nget this timer at least started.\n\n453\n00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.040\nBut Daniel, I'm foreseeing this,\n\n454\n00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.600\nis probably going to have to\ncome back to finish this up.\n\n455\n00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.270\nThere's a little thought process in here.\n\n456\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.550\nSo, what do we want to do when we start?\n\n457\n00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.020\nWell, if you think about a watch,\nit ticks, right?\n\n458\n00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.410\nA timer ticks, one second.\n\n459\n00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.150\nOne second, one second,\nand then it changes state.\n\n460\n00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:08.730\nWhat is it doing?\n\n461\n00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:14.620\nIt's changing either the time or how\nmuch time is left, after some increment.\n\n462\n00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.470\nWell, in other languages, normally, what\nyou would do is have like a while loop or\n\n463\n00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.210\na for loop that runs forever.\n\n464\n00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:24.030\nAnd then it just sleeps at the end for\na second and then reruns the loop.\n\n465\n00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.370\nWhen JavaScript,\nbecause it's asynchronous and\n\n466\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.410\nit has some weird nuances, don't do that.\n\n467\n00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.490\nYou do an infinite while loop,\nand you'll lock up your browser.\n\n468\n00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.440\nNot that I've done that,\nbut I've done that.\n\n469\n00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.360\nDon't do that.\n\n470\n00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.485\nSo that's important.\n\n471\n00:27:39.485 --> 00:27:43.560\nSo we wanna set up this timer, and\nstart is just gonna be an entry point.\n\n472\n00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.000\nWe'll actually see that we\nneed to run something else.\n\n473\n00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.870\nSo, how are we gonna do that?\n\n474\n00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:55.243\nTimer equals, well,\nnotice I'm using a variable here, right?\n\n475\n00:27:55.243 --> 00:27:57.940\nI don't have a variable for timer up here.\n\n476\n00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.810\nI should probably go ahead and\nput that in there.\n\n477\n00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:02.336\nAnd it is going to change.\n\n478\n00:28:02.336 --> 00:28:04.120\nSo I'm going to use this let binding.\n\n479\n00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.330\nNotice I'm not assigning it.\n\n480\n00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.400\nI couldn't use const here\nif I did not assign it.\n\n481\n00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.468\nI have to use let.\n\n482\n00:28:09.468 --> 00:28:12.221\nAnd what's going to happen is\nthis is going to be assigned,\n\n483\n00:28:12.221 --> 00:28:14.600\nkind of the watch mechanism for\nrunning our timer.\n\n484\n00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.130\nAnd timer is going to set the interval.\n\n485\n00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:26.970\nAnd what setInterval does is run some\nfunction every so many milliseconds.\n\n486\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.139\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n487\n00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.748\nWhat function do we want?\n\n488\n00:28:30.748 --> 00:28:32.980\nWe're actually gonna make\na function called tick.\n\n489\n00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.960\nIt's just gonna tick, tick, tick, tick.\n\n490\n00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:41.730\nAnd I want to run a thousand\nmilliseconds which is one second.\n\n491\n00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.230\nAs it stands, this will break.\n\n492\n00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.010\nIt's broke.\n\n493\n00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.000\nThere is no tick function.\n\n494\n00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.390\nAnd what do we want to do?\n\n495\n00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.390\nLet's make that tick function,\nand let's just observe.\n\n496\n00:28:57.318 --> 00:29:00.170\nYeah let's just observe how it works.\n\n497\n00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.770\nSo as it stands, start will be run\nwhen I click the Start button.\n\n498\n00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.438\nSo if I refresh.\n\n499\n00:29:08.438 --> 00:29:12.590\nStart here, here.\n\n500\n00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.650\nNotice I'm getting\na print out every second.\n\n501\n00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:18.940\nSo the setInterval is meant for\nthings like this.\n\n502\n00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.230\nSo I've seen people use this for\nanimations.\n\n503\n00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.370\nThere are other ways to handle animations.\n\n504\n00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:27.227\nAnd there is also another function called\nsetTimeout that will only run once.\n\n505\n00:29:27.227 --> 00:29:31.110\nAs it stands though,\nthis will run forever as I refresh.\n\n506\n00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:35.280\nMmm, what do we want to do with tick?\n\n507\n00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:40.580\nWell, what should happen every\ntick of the clock, right?\n\n508\n00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.210\nHow much time should I have left?\n\n509\n00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.041\nI should have one second less left.\n\n510\n00:29:46.041 --> 00:29:50.074\nSo timeLeft -= 1 and\n\n511\n00:29:50.074 --> 00:29:54.970\nthen I should re-render.\n\n512\n00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.505\nAnd I'm gonna render back out.\n\n513\n00:29:57.505 --> 00:29:59.550\nSo let's go see if it works.\n\n514\n00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:03.038\nStart Ha-ha.\n\n515\n00:30:03.038 --> 00:30:06.935\nLet's keep watching, let's keep watching.\n\n516\n00:30:06.935 --> 00:30:09.920\nSo that's all right, it's working.\n\n517\n00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.025\nAnd now, if I click start again,\nand a bunch of other times.\n\n518\n00:30:14.025 --> 00:30:15.385\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It goes crazy.\n\n519\n00:30:15.385 --> 00:30:16.711\n&gt;&gt; That is not good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:30:16.711 --> 00:30:17.812\n&gt;&gt; Because I just,\n\n521\n00:30:17.812 --> 00:30:23.410\nmy breaks are going to be long compared to\nmy 25 minutes for my Pomodoro technique.\n\n522\n00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:27.070\n&gt;&gt; So it's aggregating those one\nsecond intervals that you set up.\n\n523\n00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n524\n00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.790\nSo they're running every one second,\nbut now there's 30 of them.\n\n525\n00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Running really fast.\n\n526\n00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.120\nWell, that is a problem.\n\n527\n00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.910\nThis is known as, kind of, it's not really\nan error but it's unexpected, right?\n\n528\n00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.931\nIf you didn't see this during your\ncreation of your application and\n\n529\n00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:41.784\nyou sent this out.\n\n530\n00:30:41.784 --> 00:30:44.350\nAnd people were like, start,\nstart, start, start, start.\n\n531\n00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.660\nWell, that is a problem.\n\n532\n00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.000\nBut you know, Daniel,\n\n533\n00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.950\nI don't know if we quite have\ntime to fix this in this episode.\n\n534\n00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's just too darn bad.\n\n535\n00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.500\nCuz that is, it's interesting.\n\n536\n00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.620\nApparently our little API here,\n\n537\n00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.970\nits concept of time is\nnot exactly what ours is.\n\n538\n00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:59.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n539\n00:30:59.492 --> 00:31:02.587\n&gt;&gt; So we're definitely going to\nneed to do some finagling and\n\n540\n00:31:02.587 --> 00:31:05.160\nmake it work the way\nthat we need it to work.\n\n541\n00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.280\nBut as you said, looking at that clock,\nthat clock is well out of time for\n\n542\n00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:08.820\nthis episode.\n\n543\n00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.770\nSo we'll have to come back for\na part two, and\n\n544\n00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:16.170\nwatch Justin finish making this\nthing work as expected, as needed.\n\n545\n00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.500\nSo Justin,\nI look forward to seeing you there.\n\n546\n00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.250\nHopefully, our good audience will\njoin us in that endeavor as well.\n\n547\n00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.140\nBut like we said,\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n548\n00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.320\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n549\n00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.500\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n550\n00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.440\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n551\n00:31:34.613 --> 00:31:37.721\n[MUSIC]\n\n552\n00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:41.165\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.347\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:14.568\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:17.150\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.680\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.660\nwe are back with more on our\nIntro to Web Development series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.490\nAnd coming back with the part 2,\nkinda left you guys hanging,\n\n9\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.250\nwhen it came to our little timer\napp that we were creating.\n\n10\n00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.800\nOf course, joining us back in the studio,\nyet again, our good friend Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.490\nJustin Dennison.\n\n12\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.370\nJustin, welcome back my man,\nhow goes it, today?\n\n13\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.910\n&gt;&gt; It goes well,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.550\nHow are you today, Dan?\n\n15\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.560\n&gt;&gt; I can't complain, thank you.\n\n16\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.094\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n17\n00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:41.171\nI'm surprised you're still doing well\nafter that cliffhanger from episode 1.\n\n18\n00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:42.982\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You haven't checked that out,\n\n19\n00:00:42.982 --> 00:00:45.570\nI would definitely go back and\ncheck out episode 1.\n\n20\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.865\nWhere we had some weirdness\ngo on with our timer.\n\n21\n00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.972\nAnd just as a review,\nwe should probably just go ahead and\n\n22\n00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:55.940\njump right back into our application and\nsee what's actually going on.\n\n23\n00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.035\nAll right, what is happening?\n\n24\n00:00:58.035 --> 00:00:59.260\nSomething's broke and\n\n25\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.150\nwe still do have a few other\nfeatures that we need to implement.\n\n26\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.255\nSo, here we go.\n\n27\n00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:07.370\nJust as a reminder,\nour timer's working, it's great.\n\n28\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.618\nSomebody clicked it a bunch of times and\nnow, I got weirdness, right?\n\n29\n00:01:12.618 --> 00:01:13.554\nThat's no good.\n\n30\n00:01:13.554 --> 00:01:14.741\nAnd how am I gonna fix that?\n\n31\n00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:23.260\nI don't know but I now know this is part\nof what operation, the Start button click.\n\n32\n00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.680\nIf it's part of the start button click,\n\n33\n00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.350\nmy first kinda breadcrumb that I'm\ngonna look for is the Start function.\n\n34\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.130\nNow that I have this organization pattern\nthat I've been going over and over and\n\n35\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.070\nover and over, I don't have to go\nlooking all over the place going,\n\n36\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.580\nI wonder where that's happening?\n\n37\n00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.240\nSo, let's hop back into\nour application here.\n\n38\n00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.570\nAnd when I click the Start button,\nit runs start.\n\n39\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.900\nNow, you'll notice that I said\ntimer = setInterval tick, right?\n\n40\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.630\nAnd tick is the function that is counting\ndown 1 second and re-rendering the timer.\n\n41\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.330\nSo, let's take a look at timer,\nwe also have a let statement up here.\n\n42\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.270\nLet's look at what timer is before and\nafter the setInterval.\n\n43\n00:02:11.177 --> 00:02:14.213\nSo I'm gonna log a timer and\njust as a quick aside,\n\n44\n00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:18.987\neventually we will dive into better\ndebugging tools but I think it's good just\n\n45\n00:02:18.987 --> 00:02:23.904\nto have something simple to lean on when\nyou're first starting this Just seek and\n\n46\n00:02:23.904 --> 00:02:27.290\nso okay,\nI need to inspect this really quick.\n\n47\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.940\nSo I'm refreshing and\nI'm going to start and\n\n48\n00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.500\nnotice when I have this first print\nstatement, timer is undefined.\n\n49\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.450\nWhen I get this next print statement,\ntimer has been assigned to one,and that's\n\n50\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:47.080\nbecause set interval will return some\ntruthie value, it's okay, so timer.\n\n51\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.320\nTimer is undefined which is falsey but\nset interval will give me a truth value.\n\n52\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.110\nMaybe it's 1, maybe it's 42, maybe it's\n67 but it's something that's non 0.\n\n53\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.710\nAnd since it's non 0 I can use that\nas a decision making process for\n\n54\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.760\nthis start function to\nguard against shenanigans.\n\n55\n00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.270\nAll right, now how am I gonna do that,\nI wanna say if.\n\n56\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.150\nTimer, and actually I wanna say if\nthere is not already a timer running.\n\n57\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.900\nI want to start one.\n\n58\n00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:27.868\nAnd that is the only time, I want to\nset interval and run [INAUDIBLE] And\n\n59\n00:03:27.868 --> 00:03:32.146\nwhat that's gonna do is keep me from\nactually spawning a bunch of timers,\n\n60\n00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:34.630\nthat'll just do all that weird behavior.\n\n61\n00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.790\nAnd let's see if that\nworks to our advantage.\n\n62\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.840\nIf we refresh, and\nI'll click Start, we now have that.\n\n63\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.370\nIt's still just a second along.\n\n64\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.500\nThis is kind of a weird syntax.\n\n65\n00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.510\nThis is,\ndoes not work in a lot of other languages.\n\n66\n00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.042\nThis is leveraging some of that truthy,\nfalsey JavaScript behavior.\n\n67\n00:03:58.042 --> 00:03:59.980\nSo if there is not already a timer.\n\n68\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.340\nThat's how I read it,\nI don't care if it's, if it's one,\n\n69\n00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.490\n42 If it doesn't exist, it's one of\nthose falsey values, then set it.\n\n70\n00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.680\nOtherwise, just keep on\ngoing about your way, right.\n\n71\n00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.640\nIt actually skips that if statement,\nruns through the function, and\n\n72\n00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.180\nnothing else occurs.\n\n73\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.940\nThat's good.\n\n74\n00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.170\nNow we have a timer that works.\n\n75\n00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.840\nBut if I click stop Well,\nstop does not work.\n\n76\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.980\nSo, the way I have this set up though,\n\n77\n00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.300\nI just have to worry about\nimplementing the stop function.\n\n78\n00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.250\nLet's see here.\n\n79\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.680\nWhat do I need to do?\n\n80\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:46.530\nIf I think about this, I need to some\nhow figure out how to stop that timer.\n\n81\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.010\nSo, if I clear the interval,\nnow this is a built in function and\n\n82\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.620\nthe whole goal is to get rid of those set\ninterval things that are running forever.\n\n83\n00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.780\nI want to clear interval timer and\n\n84\n00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.020\nnotice now that's why I\nneeded this global variable.\n\n85\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.500\nI needed to access this because,\nbelieve it or\n\n86\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.960\nnot If I remove this, the set\ninterval will still start the timer.\n\n87\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.240\nHowever, there's no way to\never stop it prgrammatically,\n\n88\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.070\nbecause I don't have a reference to it.\n\n89\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.880\nSo it's important to have a reference\nto it, so I can clear it.\n\n90\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.030\nNow clear interval,\nthis one wipes away the set interval.\n\n91\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.000\nSo, if I clear the interval timer and\nI refresh, Well,\n\n92\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.930\nlet's start it up again, see how it works.\n\n93\n00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.210\nSo I'm counting down, I stop.\n\n94\n00:05:32.923 --> 00:05:35.920\nAnd now I wanna start on now.\n\n95\n00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.040\nNow I run into another problem.\n\n96\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.400\nBut, where is that?\n\n97\n00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.140\n&gt;&gt; It's like every fix that you've\nemployed just breaks something else.\n\n98\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.490\nYou're constantly running down problems.\n\n99\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, but notice because I'm doing\nthis, what is kind of an atomic change,\n\n100\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.550\nvery small changes\n&gt;&gt; I dont have to be overwhelmed with,\n\n101\n00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.330\nI dont know where that broke, right.\n\n102\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.690\nI fixed Start and\n\n103\n00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.150\nthen I moved on to Stop and\nwhen I made Stop word, Start broke again.\n\n104\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.210\nSo now we have to problem solve a little\nbit, we have to reason, I have Stop,\n\n105\n00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.020\nwhich is clearing the interval, But here,\n\n106\n00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.130\nstart is not, it doesn't set a new\none if timer already exists.\n\n107\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.260\nAnd what timer existing means is,\n\n108\n00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.650\nthe variable timer has\na truthy value in it, right?\n\n109\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.490\nSo if I, console.log.\n\n110\n00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.500\nI'm gonna put those back.\n\n111\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.000\nAnd I look here.\n\n112\n00:06:31.563 --> 00:06:38.580\nOkay, and then if I now refresh,\nI'm going to start.\n\n113\n00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.890\nNotice I have undefined\nin one when I start.\n\n114\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.880\nI'm going to stop.\n\n115\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.000\nAnd when I click start again,\nnotice one is still assigned to timer.\n\n116\n00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.830\nSo that timer variable still has\nreference to A truthy value.\n\n117\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.070\nSo as far as JavaScript is\nconcerned this if statement\n\n118\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.260\nstill evaluates to hey timer already\nexists, we shouldn't be doing this.\n\n119\n00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.440\nSo how can I fix that?\n\n120\n00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.720\nSo there's several ways and\nwhat I'm going to do is\n\n121\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.740\nJust say timer = undefined,\nbecause that's what it was originally.\n\n122\n00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.840\nAnd I can do that.\n\n123\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.740\nMaybe that's not the best way, but\nthis is part of a thought process, right?\n\n124\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.810\nWhen I stop, I wanna clear the timer,\n\n125\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.820\nand reset the timer variable\nto what it was before Right?\n\n126\n00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.310\nAnd that way, the start function,\nas I've implemented it, still works.\n\n127\n00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.810\nBut we're gonna take a quick aside and\nsee if this works out in our favor.\n\n128\n00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.700\nSo if we refresh and\nI click Start, all right.\n\n129\n00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.860\nIf I click Stop, okay.\n\n130\n00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.647\nStart, and now that's coming back But,\n\n131\n00:07:47.647 --> 00:07:51.702\nis there anything special about undefined?\n\n132\n00:07:51.702 --> 00:07:55.912\nAs a new web developer, you're like,\nok, well I've reproduced,\n\n133\n00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:59.700\nI got it to work, now I need to\nfigure out, why does this work?\n\n134\n00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.438\nSo, I'm a big proponent of try it out.\n\n135\n00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:05.300\nI said undefined is a false E-value.\n\n136\n00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.530\nWhat about other false E-values?\n\n137\n00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.220\nIf I set timer to zero,\ndoes it still work?\n\n138\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.250\nWell, let's see.\n\n139\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.474\nI start, I stop.\n\n140\n00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:15.830\nI start again and it in fact still works.\n\n141\n00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.990\nWhat about other false E-values like null,\nright?\n\n142\n00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.540\nI'm de-referencing timer from\nthe from the number one,\n\n143\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.870\nand the number one's coming\nout of the set interval.\n\n144\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.370\nSet interval is returning\nsome truthy value.\n\n145\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.400\nAnd if I refresh, I start, and I stop,\n\n146\n00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.550\nand I start again, notice it still runs.\n\n147\n00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.426\nSo there's nothing particular about\nthe falsely value that you choose,\n\n148\n00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:47.006\nit's just I'll be referencing from this\ntruthiness that is spit out by said timer,\n\n149\n00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:48.990\nor set interval, excuse me.\n\n150\n00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.540\nSo now we have this timer function, right.\n\n151\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.990\nAnd I'm just gonna keep\nthis as undefined just for\n\n152\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.270\nclarity because originally when we\nload the page timer is undefined.\n\n153\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.450\nAnd then when we click start,\ntimer is defined.\n\n154\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.645\nAnd when we click stop, we wanna make\ntimer undefined so our start works again.\n\n155\n00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:08.940\nNotice I have some circular logic there.\n\n156\n00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.600\nBut let's role play a little bit.\n\n157\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.930\nI have the start and the stop.\n\n158\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:18.460\nWell, I had a code review with my client,\nmy boss.\n\n159\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.990\nAnd we really want to be\nable to reset to 25 minutes\n\n160\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.540\njust in case something goes wrong, right.\n\n161\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.770\nYou get distracted,\nyou haven't had your 25 minutes of work or\n\n162\n00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.560\nyou start it and\nsomeone calls you into a meeting.\n\n163\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.890\nI need to be able to reset to 25 minutes.\n\n164\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:38.060\nOkay, all right, so\nlet's have a reset button, right.\n\n165\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.270\nI could just refresh, but\nI wanna reset button.\n\n166\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.190\nRefreshing is so passe.\n\n167\n00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.030\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n168\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.990\nWell if I think about this I need to\nfirst add the button to the interface.\n\n169\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.500\nSince I already have these buttons,\nI'm gonna follow the same logic.\n\n170\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.590\nAnd do I put the start, or excuse me, the\nreset between start and stop, after stop?\n\n171\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.740\nWell, you gotta commit sometime.\n\n172\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.930\nSo here's reset and button,\nand I'm gonna say reset.\n\n173\n00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.710\nAnd now I'm adding a feature.\n\n174\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:18.340\nBut because my code is organized, well,\nI can just go from top to bottom.\n\n175\n00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.850\nDo I need any other data or\nvariables to find?\n\n176\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.580\nI don't think so.\n\n177\n00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.930\nMaybe I will later.\n\n178\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.750\nDo I need a new reference to a button,\nlike a cache to the dom?\n\n179\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.430\nWell actually, I do.\n\n180\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.910\nI need a reset button.\n\n181\n00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.040\nAnd that is part of the controls.\n\n182\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.490\nAnd I'm going to say querySelector and\n\n183\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:43.240\ndo some craziness there, and\nthen look for the reset button.\n\n184\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:50.190\nOkay, now,\ndo I need it to respond to a click?\n\n185\n00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.180\nProbably so, right, how else am I\ngoing to reset if it's not clickable.\n\n186\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.990\nWhat's the point of having a button\nif it doesn't do anything.\n\n187\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.290\nWhich is kind of the weird\nthing that throws people off.\n\n188\n00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.730\nWhen you make a HTML button, you're like\nhey look, it doesn't do anything really.\n\n189\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.220\nUnless you make it part of a form,\n\n190\n00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.200\nand then you have to know\nhow to handle HTML forms.\n\n191\n00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.790\nWe just want this\na simple web application.\n\n192\n00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.703\nSo I'm gonna say\nresetButton.addEventListener.\n\n193\n00:11:18.938 --> 00:11:20.800\nAnd I'm gonna say reset.\n\n194\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.330\nAnd again,\nI've been asked to add a feature but\n\n195\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.580\nnow I have little bitty\nsnippets that I can follow.\n\n196\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.550\nLittle bread crumbs that I can figure\nout where I'm I supposed to go?\n\n197\n00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.830\nWell, render that shouldn't change.\n\n198\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.980\nStart, tick, stop.\n\n199\n00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.205\nThat shouldn't change.\n\n200\n00:11:37.205 --> 00:11:41.500\nPad, all I need to do is add the reset.\n\n201\n00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:49.220\nAnd you should actually use\nthe function keyword, To reset.\n\n202\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.290\nAnd what is reset going to do?\n\n203\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.140\nHm.\n\n204\n00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.889\nI need to reset back to 25 minutes.\n\n205\n00:11:55.889 --> 00:12:01.130\nOkay, well, hm.\n\n206\n00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.293\nTime left starts here.\n\n207\n00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:12.440\nIt's almost, like I need to\nremember where I started, right.\n\n208\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.770\n&gt;&gt; Would you create a variable that\nholds that value inside of it so\n\n209\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.590\nyou can recall that?\n\n210\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.220\nOr what would be the best methodology?\n\n211\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.450\n&gt;&gt; Daniel, it's like you're reading my\nmind and it's kind of freaking me out.\n\n212\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.365\nSo, you're absolutely correct.\n\n213\n00:12:22.365 --> 00:12:25.560\nNow there's a multitude of\nways to handle this but\n\n214\n00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.410\nif you think about it, probably the best\nway is to hold a value called old time.\n\n215\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:35.140\nAnd when you reset you're going\nto reset to the old time and\n\n216\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.580\nthis is in preparation to, well,\npeople are asking me for new features.\n\n217\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.510\nWhat if they want me to be\nable to set the time, right?\n\n218\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.390\nIn Pomadora,\nwe actually need different times and\n\n219\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.690\nmaybe I'm just building a standard\ntimer where someone needs,\n\n220\n00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.780\nI need a 3 minute timer, I need a 5\nminute timer, I need a 25 minute timer.\n\n221\n00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.480\nSo, you're absolutely right,\nDaniel, oldTime.\n\n222\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.040\nAnd we're just gonna leave\nthat undefined for now.\n\n223\n00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.760\nSo let's think about this.\n\n224\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.660\nOld time, when should it be initialized?\n\n225\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.290\nWhen should it be set to a value?\n\n226\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:17.450\nI could put it in the reset,\nI could put it in stop.\n\n227\n00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:22.950\nBut I think it makes the most\nsense before I start the timer\n\n228\n00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:29.497\nwhich is modifying time left,\nmaybe I'd say oldTime = timeLeft.\n\n229\n00:13:29.497 --> 00:13:32.520\nAnd I'm just saying hey\nold time is the time left.\n\n230\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.290\nAnd since this is a primitive\nvalue i should have\n\n231\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.100\nthe values stored without being modified.\n\n232\n00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.830\nIf this was an object you may get some\nweird behavior, so do keep that in mind.\n\n233\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.120\nAnd then what about reset?\n\n234\n00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.840\nWhat do I wanna do on reset?\n\n235\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.510\nWell I want to say, timeLeft\n\n236\n00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.730\n= oldTime and rerender.\n\n237\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:59.050\nSo if I've done that correctly it should,\neverything should work perfectly.\n\n238\n00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.348\nNow we will notice there's\nsome weirdness going on.\n\n239\n00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:08.209\nSo I'm gonna start,\nI'm gonna reset, reset.\n\n240\n00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.860\nDo you want the timer to\nautomatically start back up?\n\n241\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.530\nThat's a decision.\n\n242\n00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.860\nI asked my boss and he said no,\n\n243\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.060\nwhen you reset you have\nthe option to start it again.\n\n244\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:28.880\nOkay, well I could clear the interval and\nset timer equal to undefined.\n\n245\n00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.759\nBut because I've made this a single\nkind of responsibility for\n\n246\n00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:36.990\neach of these functions, I can say stop.\n\n247\n00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.970\nI can actually call that\nfunction inside of reset,\n\n248\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.720\nand it says set the old time,\nstop the timer, book.\n\n249\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.460\nIt's good.\nRe-render.\n\n250\n00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.900\nSo let's see if it works.\n\n251\n00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.969\nSo start, reset.\n\n252\n00:14:49.969 --> 00:14:51.716\nStart.\n\n253\n00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:52.842\nReset.\n\n254\n00:14:52.842 --> 00:14:55.420\nWe've added that feature.\n\n255\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:01.440\nBut you know I wonder,\nwhat happens if I, no.\n\n256\n00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.240\n&gt;&gt; You done broke it.\n\n257\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.520\n&gt;&gt; Done gone and broke it.\n\n258\n00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.910\nSo there's an unforeseen, what if someone\nclicks reset on page load, right?\n\n259\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.090\nYour timer hasn't been running yet.\n\n260\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:17.720\nWell it's NaN because old time hasn't been\nset until start is initially clicked.\n\n261\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.300\nSo we have to guard against that.\n\n262\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.320\nNow there are several ways.\n\n263\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.180\nI tend to go with simple conditional\nlogic if it's not crazy, right.\n\n264\n00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.760\nTechnically, there's no errors\nother than our run time error,\n\n265\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.180\nbecause I try to take a non number and do\nnumber stuff with it, and what did I get?\n\n266\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.926\nWell, not a number,\nI mean that's obvious there, NaN.\n\n267\n00:15:35.926 --> 00:15:38.400\nSo for reset, what do I want to do?\n\n268\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.166\nI want to guard against\nresetting to NaN values.\n\n269\n00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:48.332\nSo before I do that if there\nis not an oldTime set,\n\n270\n00:15:48.332 --> 00:15:53.624\nright, if oldTime has not\nbeen set which means you\n\n271\n00:15:53.624 --> 00:16:00.179\nhave not clicked the Start button,\nthen I just wanna return.\n\n272\n00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:03.179\nI wanna jump out of that function,\nnothing else happens.\n\n273\n00:16:03.179 --> 00:16:05.970\nOkay, well,\nwe should probably do some more testing.\n\n274\n00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:11.100\nSo if I click Reset, notice I now\nno longer have that runtime error.\n\n275\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:11.915\nDoes Start still work?\n\n276\n00:16:11.915 --> 00:16:14.870\nIf it does, does Reset work otherwise?\n\n277\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.910\nIt does, does Stop?\n\n278\n00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.479\nWhat if I refresh and hit Stop?\n\n279\n00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.480\nStart, it's good to go,\nit's wonderful, I love it.\n\n280\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.851\nSo, we have all of these pieces together.\n\n281\n00:16:30.851 --> 00:16:36.120\nWe've started kinda organizing\nthis almost in an object, right?\n\n282\n00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.650\nNow, what I'm gonna do is start\nthis refactoring process,\n\n283\n00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.112\nbecause you never know.\n\n284\n00:16:41.112 --> 00:16:44.316\nThere might be other\nfeatures that we want, but\n\n285\n00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:48.200\nit's probably best I have\nthis core set of features.\n\n286\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.160\nI want to do a refactor before I\nsubmit it again for a code review, for\n\n287\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.430\nlike a future request.\n\n288\n00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.710\nAnd that's maybe for a little bit of\nclean up, If we're looking around.\n\n289\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:02.560\nAnd this time,\nwe're actually gonna utilize ES6 classes.\n\n290\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.860\nWhich behind the scenes, give us\nobjects just like the object literal.\n\n291\n00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.560\nBut what it allows me to do, is with\nclasses, I can construct a bunch of them.\n\n292\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.540\nAnd with a bunch of them, I can set it up\nto where, I have timers everywhere, right?\n\n293\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:22.170\nMaybe I need to have timers that keep pace\nwith different things that I'm doing.\n\n294\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.100\nAnd, okay, so\nlet's start with this refactor.\n\n295\n00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:32.940\nSo I have all of my pieces here,\nand I'm gonna start with class.\n\n296\n00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.360\nAnd let's just call this a timer.\n\n297\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.750\nAnd I need a constructor function.\n\n298\n00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.230\nAnd this is how is my\ntimer going to be set up.\n\n299\n00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.620\nWhat things do I need to do?\n\n300\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.870\nAnd I know this, it does take an argument\n\n301\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.310\nof the element that it resides within,\nrigh?\n\n302\n00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.210\nAnd what do I mean?\n\n303\n00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.580\nI haven't used it here so much.\n\n304\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.420\nBut we wanna make it to\nwhere I can give it an ID.\n\n305\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.340\nAnd as long as this mark up exists\nwith this ID and this structure,\n\n306\n00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.290\nI can get multiple independent\ntimers using the class syntax.\n\n307\n00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.960\nSo, what do I need to do?\n\n308\n00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.980\nI need to say this.element,\nso this.element means for\n\n309\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.540\nthe object created from this class,\nit's gonna be set to this.element.\n\n310\n00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.690\nOr, excuse me,\n\n311\n00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.870\nthe element that's passed in will be\nthe property element on the object.\n\n312\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.820\nSo, let's see how that\nworks just real quick.\n\n313\n00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.470\nAnd new Timer, and\nwhat's the ID here, what's timer?\n\n314\n00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.150\nSo I'm going to say #timer, and\n\n315\n00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.491\nI'm putting #timer because I know I'm\ngoing to use a DOM selector there.\n\n316\n00:18:42.491 --> 00:18:46.505\nBecause I'm gonna set that up,\nand we should be good to go.\n\n317\n00:18:46.505 --> 00:18:50.440\nSo let's see here, and\nnotice I have a Timer object.\n\n318\n00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.090\nAnd notice,\nit's not called an object anymore,\n\n319\n00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.350\nit's actually a specific\nobject called Timer.\n\n320\n00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.933\nSo I have that set up,\nnow what do I wanna do?\n\n321\n00:19:00.933 --> 00:19:05.735\nI want to cache the Dom,\n\n322\n00:19:05.735 --> 00:19:10.810\nI want to addListeners.\n\n323\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.700\nAnd I want to render the very first time.\n\n324\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.310\nNow, because I'm using a class,\nI do not have to worry about commas here.\n\n325\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:23.063\nActually, that will cause an error,\nbut I'm gonna create cacheDom.\n\n326\n00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:31.040\nI'm gonna create addListeners, and\nI'm gonna make my render function here.\n\n327\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.430\nNow, this is very similar\nto creating the object,\n\n328\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.220\nexcept I can use this class\nas kind of a cookie cutter.\n\n329\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.220\nA template to reproducibly make these,\nover, and over and over again.\n\n330\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:47.820\nSo if I want to cache the DOM, well\nlet's see, I need all of these things.\n\n331\n00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:54.110\nAnd what we'll find is this is\ngonna get a little iffy here.\n\n332\n00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.900\nI need to attach this display, all right,\n\n333\n00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:04.070\nto this object, To this display.\n\n334\n00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:09.590\nBut I have to be careful, I don't want to\nsearch the entire document for display.\n\n335\n00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.235\nI actually want to search\nthe root of this for, more or\n\n336\n00:20:14.235 --> 00:20:18.169\nless a better word,\na component or a module.\n\n337\n00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:20.910\nI wanna search just within this context.\n\n338\n00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.840\nSo how am I gonna do that?\n\n339\n00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.270\nWell, Not with a bunch of spaces in there.\n\n340\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:32.435\nI wanna say document.querySelector, And,\n\n341\n00:20:32.435 --> 00:20:37.478\nwell, I've already constructed,\nthat's part of the construction, right?\n\n342\n00:20:37.478 --> 00:20:41.525\nI pass in that element\nthat should be the root.\n\n343\n00:20:41.525 --> 00:20:44.060\nSo I'm gonna say this.element.\n\n344\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:50.510\nAnd let's see how this plays out by\nsaying this.rootElement.querySelector.\n\n345\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.257\nSo, let's go Refresh, and\nnotice that I have the display and\n\n346\n00:20:55.257 --> 00:20:57.280\nit's highlighted here.\n\n347\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.840\nAnd I have the rootElement, which is\nthe entire timer in and of itself.\n\n348\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.080\nSo now I've kind of encapsulated, started\nto encapsulate that as I did before.\n\n349\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.871\nSo this cacheDom, pretty much the rest of\nthis is going to be the same except for\n\n350\n00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:13.890\ncontrols.\n\n351\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:19.250\nSo just in the sake of being expedient,\n\n352\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.340\nI'm going to paste.\n\n353\n00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:27.130\nI'm gonna grab all these const's,\nThat's kind of a hard word to say.\n\n354\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:34.171\nAnd then this should be this.rootElement,\n\n355\n00:21:34.171 --> 00:21:38.372\nand this will be this.display, And\n\n356\n00:21:38.372 --> 00:21:44.904\nall of these controls,\nnot that control, not that one.\n\n357\n00:21:44.904 --> 00:21:47.601\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah gotta be careful with that\n\n358\n00:21:47.601 --> 00:21:50.005\nshortcut, to select a bunch of things.\n\n359\n00:21:50.005 --> 00:21:51.589\nBecause you'll get\na little carried away and\n\n360\n00:21:51.589 --> 00:21:54.050\nstart selecting things you don't mean to.\n\n361\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:58.550\nSo, if I have all these cached now,\nthese are contained within that object.\n\n362\n00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.570\nBased on the root element,\nand this is timer.\n\n363\n00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.900\nSo, let's refresh,\nsee what that looks like.\n\n364\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.292\nWe're starting to build that up for us.\n\n365\n00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:10.020\nNow, addListeners, what do I want to do?\n\n366\n00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.151\nI wanna say\n\n367\n00:22:12.151 --> 00:22:21.580\nthis.startButton.addEventListener, and,\nfor\n\n368\n00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:27.010\na click I want to say this,\nwell I could just say start here.\n\n369\n00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.320\nBut what I'm going to find is I\nneed to keep that all bundled up.\n\n370\n00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.420\nI don't want that to be\nglobally named space, and\n\n371\n00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.890\nthen I know that I want the context of\nthis object to be available within start.\n\n372\n00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:45.366\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nbind the function start,\n\n373\n00:22:45.366 --> 00:22:49.227\nand then stopbutton.addEventListener.\n\n374\n00:22:53.757 --> 00:22:57.463\nThere we go, lot of typing, lot of typing.\n\n375\n00:22:57.463 --> 00:23:03.586\nAnd then, finally, the resetButton and\nthen addEventListener.\n\n376\n00:23:03.586 --> 00:23:08.467\nAnd I find that I'm almost as fast\nof a typer as I am a copy paster.\n\n377\n00:23:08.467 --> 00:23:14.818\nSo there we go, and bind, so\nnow I've set up the addEventListeners,\n\n378\n00:23:14.818 --> 00:23:19.980\nand what we're gonna find is, it's broke.\n\n379\n00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.990\n&gt;&gt; You broke it again.\n\n380\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.030\n&gt;&gt; Why did I break it?\n\n381\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:27.049\nWell, Start, Stop and\nReset are not part of this class,\n\n382\n00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:31.127\nso I'm gonna go ahead and\nmake Start, Stop and\n\n383\n00:23:31.127 --> 00:23:35.871\nReset Refresh, and\n\n384\n00:23:35.871 --> 00:23:39.100\nthere where we go, and\nnotice, this is still good.\n\n385\n00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:45.910\nThis is still displaying because\nthe old code is still displaying that.\n\n386\n00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:50.660\nNow, let's go ahead and add this render.\n\n387\n00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.999\nWhat are we rendering to?\n\n388\n00:23:52.999 --> 00:23:58.195\nWell the render is more or less\nthe exact same thing that we had here.\n\n389\n00:23:58.195 --> 00:24:04.729\nExcept notice we don't have a time left\nI'm going to have to figure that out.\n\n390\n00:24:04.729 --> 00:24:10.265\nSo I'm actually just going\nto grab all of this and\n\n391\n00:24:10.265 --> 00:24:15.395\npaste and\nthen time left should be part of this\n\n392\n00:24:15.395 --> 00:24:20.810\nobject time left should\nbe part of this object.\n\n393\n00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.355\nAnd then I don't need this here for\nminutes left, seconds left,\n\n394\n00:24:26.355 --> 00:24:30.620\ncuz those are computed each\ntime render is called.\n\n395\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.748\nBut this.minutes and this.seconds\nshould be, should have the this cuz\n\n396\n00:24:35.748 --> 00:24:41.879\nthey're specific to this module, to this\nsmall little application we're building.\n\n397\n00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:43.550\nOkay.\n\n398\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.180\nI know that we're gonna need pads,\nam go ahead and\n\n399\n00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:52.000\ngrab pad, the inner part of pad here.\n\n400\n00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.390\nSo copy, and I need to add pad.\n\n401\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:25:02.380\nAnd again the ultimate goal here\nis to have this modularity.\n\n402\n00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.850\nI can move this around and\n\n403\n00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.600\ncreate new timer applications\nin the context of other ones.\n\n404\n00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.560\nLet's see how this works.\n\n405\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.440\nRefresh.\n\n406\n00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.610\nIt's broke.\n\n407\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.490\nAnd why is it broke?\n\n408\n00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.460\nWell, I used some constants and\n\n409\n00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.069\nsome things here that are outside\nthe scope of this class.\n\n410\n00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.690\nAnd this class is getting instantiated.\n\n411\n00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.855\nI'm creating an object before\nthe constant is there.\n\n412\n00:25:25.855 --> 00:25:33.410\nAll right, well, it would almost be\nnice if I could give the root element,\n\n413\n00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.910\nthe minutes and the seconds,\nkind of a fun construction.\n\n414\n00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.630\nAnd I could get time left, alt time and\n\n415\n00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:45.350\ntimer, well time left needs to be\ncomputed as we construct this object.\n\n416\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:50.150\nSo I'm going to create const seconds and\nminutes.\n\n417\n00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.734\nI'm gonna bring this up here,\nand well, hm.\n\n418\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.850\nLet's just put this inside of the\nconstructor, we just need this for now.\n\n419\n00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:07.920\nAnd actually,\nlet's make this part of the object, right.\n\n420\n00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.340\nNow, keep in mind because this is now\npart of an object, I can reassign this,\n\n421\n00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.060\npeople can mess with this and\nmess things up.\n\n422\n00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:20.548\nBut also, I want to compute time left.\n\n423\n00:26:20.548 --> 00:26:27.010\nKind of institute as\nthings are constructed.\n\n424\n00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.730\nSo instead of let time left,\nI'm gonna say this.timeleft.\n\n425\n00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.250\nAnd instead of 25,\n\n426\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.809\nI'm gonna have the constructor take\nminutes and seconds as arguments.\n\n427\n00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.300\nAnd I'm gonna default minutes to 25 and\nI'm gonna default seconds to 00.\n\n428\n00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.530\nThese are new features in JavaScript that\nkind of help us clean up some of these.\n\n429\n00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:53.820\nAnd I'm going to say minutes and seconds.\n\n430\n00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.650\nSo refresh.\n\n431\n00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.760\nOctal literals are not up, yep, see.\n\n432\n00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.480\nI told you, you gotta be\ncareful with those 00's there.\n\n433\n00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.880\nSeconds and\nminutes not defined, new timer.\n\n434\n00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.800\nNow because I have seconds and minutes,\nif you come down here notice seconds and\n\n435\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.830\nminutes is not being\nused off of the object.\n\n436\n00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.300\nSince I have attached it to the object.\n\n437\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.290\nI'm going to add that as a property and\nI have it somewhere else here.\n\n438\n00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.780\nLine four ha-ha.\n\n439\n00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.820\nNotice since I attached\nit to the property here.\n\n440\n00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.890\nI still have to reference it with this\ninside of this constructor function so\n\n441\n00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.870\nif we refresh okay.\n\n442\n00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:42.340\nIf anything is good we should be able to\ncome in out the remainder of this and\n\n443\n00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.550\nsee if things work.\n\n444\n00:27:45.255 --> 00:27:47.310\nPad is not defined and why is that?\n\n445\n00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.650\nWell because I am not using\npad from the outside but\n\n446\n00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:56.780\ninstead from the inside of the class.\n\n447\n00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.820\nSo this pad right here not the outer pad.\n\n448\n00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.020\nSo if I refresh, aha.\n\n449\n00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.170\nNow we're getting somewhere.\n\n450\n00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.690\nWe got a couple other things to do for\n\n451\n00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:10.930\nthis refactor to be done and\nthat's start, stop and reset.\n\n452\n00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:11.960\nWell, what does start do?\n\n453\n00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:19.930\nWell, if there is not a timer.\n\n454\n00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.860\nRight, and let's rename timer, right?\n\n455\n00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.020\nI have a timer that has a timer in it and\nit's kinda confusing.\n\n456\n00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.990\nLet's call it a ticker.\n\n457\n00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.214\nRight, tick, tick, tick, tick.\n\n458\n00:28:28.214 --> 00:28:34.113\nThen, this.ticker = setInterval\n\n459\n00:28:34.113 --> 00:28:39.570\nof this.tick for every 1000 milliseconds.\n\n460\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:45.480\nAnd because I've changed ticker\nI need to make sure that I have,\n\n461\n00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.170\nlooks like I'm good to\ngo up until this point.\n\n462\n00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:48.900\nMake sure.\n\n463\n00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.000\nYep.\n\n464\n00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.840\n&gt;&gt; You didn't do that thing you\nnormally do where it breaks.\n\n465\n00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.628\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well.\n\n466\n00:28:53.628 --> 00:28:54.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n467\n00:28:54.714 --> 00:28:56.885\n&gt;&gt; You have a strong\nassertion there Daniel.\n\n468\n00:28:56.885 --> 00:28:58.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am refreshing and\n\n469\n00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.040\nit is not broken\n&gt;&gt; We're proud of you.\n\n470\n00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:01.720\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n471\n00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.538\nI am proud of me as also.\n\n472\n00:29:03.538 --> 00:29:08.531\nSo because of this.tick if I actually\nclick the Start button it would be\n\n473\n00:29:08.531 --> 00:29:09.622\nbroken, but.\n\n474\n00:29:11.945 --> 00:29:16.667\nSo this.start looks good and\nevent listeners and\n\n475\n00:29:16.667 --> 00:29:19.930\nthen we should be good, right?\n\n476\n00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:20.960\nSo stop.\n\n477\n00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400\nWell what was stop?\n\n478\n00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:29.000\nStop was just clear the interval and\nthen set the ticker to nothing.\n\n479\n00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.198\nSo stop if, actually I want to say\n\n480\n00:29:34.198 --> 00:29:39.399\nclear interval this.ticker and\n\n481\n00:29:39.399 --> 00:29:44.060\nthis.ticker = undefined.\n\n482\n00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.120\nAnd we'll talk about this in\nthe context of an object.\n\n483\n00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.620\nI don't know if this is the greatest thing\nto do when you're bundling up properties\n\n484\n00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.800\nin an object.\n\n485\n00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.520\nAnd then what does reset do?\n\n486\n00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.190\nWell, we already have reset done here.\n\n487\n00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.570\nWe don't have to rethink the algorithm.\n\n488\n00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:04.880\nWe need to return timeLeft equals oldTime\nwe get that old time thing, right?\n\n489\n00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.764\nIf we're starting this oldTime equals\n\n490\n00:30:09.764 --> 00:30:16.570\nthis.timeLeft, And that looks good.\n\n491\n00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.390\nThat looks good.\n\n492\n00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:23.576\nAnd then here in reset, we wanna say,\n\n493\n00:30:23.576 --> 00:30:28.468\nthis.timeLeft = this.oldTime but\n\n494\n00:30:28.468 --> 00:30:33.203\nif there is not an oldTime property,\n\n495\n00:30:33.203 --> 00:30:39.555\nthen I want to return And I wanna stop,\n\n496\n00:30:39.555 --> 00:30:45.579\nmake sure you call this.stop because it\nis now part of the class and this.render.\n\n497\n00:30:47.112 --> 00:30:52.322\nAll right, so okay, let's go refresh and\n\n498\n00:30:52.322 --> 00:30:57.400\nif we click start It's kind of weird.\n\n499\n00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.240\nDaniel.\n\n500\n00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.580\nIt's not starting, but this looks\nexactly like all the other ones.\n\n501\n00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.300\nExcept I'm missing something.\n\n502\n00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.430\nI have know that this tick.\n\n503\n00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.060\nThere's no tick inside of here.\n\n504\n00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:19.550\nI need to add a tick method\nthis.timeLeft is minus equals 1.\n\n505\n00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.170\nAnd then this.render.\n\n506\n00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.720\nIf I refresh looks good.\n\n507\n00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.600\nThis.render is not a function.\n\n508\n00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.430\nWell, that's odd, why would that occur?\n\n509\n00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.780\n&gt;&gt; Because it's not a function.\n\n510\n00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Well Daniel,\nyou're absolutely on top of it my man.\n\n511\n00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.170\n&gt;&gt; So you haven't created a function,\nright?\n\n512\n00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.960\nOr you haven't defined it as a function?\n\n513\n00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n514\n00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.155\nAnd part of that is,\nif we look at where this references,\n\n515\n00:31:45.155 --> 00:31:48.440\nthis.render inside of tick why is\nit not a function inside of tick?\n\n516\n00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.740\nIt works everywhere else.\n\n517\n00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.264\nThe initial render works.\n\n518\n00:31:51.264 --> 00:31:56.188\nAnd that's because of the context\nthat we're calling tick,\n\n519\n00:31:56.188 --> 00:32:02.247\nsetInterval is actually a function on\nthe window object of the browser And,\n\n520\n00:32:02.247 --> 00:32:08.424\nbecause it is when it runs this function,\nit keeps the context of the window.\n\n521\n00:32:08.424 --> 00:32:12.430\nSo just remember I told you, you got\nto be careful about the this context.\n\n522\n00:32:15.303 --> 00:32:19.830\nSo, if I refresh and notice I just\nget a bunch of shenanigans there.\n\n523\n00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.135\nI click start, notice it says Window,\nWindow, Window.\n\n524\n00:32:23.135 --> 00:32:27.682\nAnd that's that kinda global thing\nthat controls all of the browser, but\n\n525\n00:32:27.682 --> 00:32:31.880\nwe don't want it to be Window,\nwe want it to be this object, right?\n\n526\n00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.170\nHow do we change that?\n\n527\n00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:39.135\nAgain, that's one of those times\nwhere I want to bind the this context\n\n528\n00:32:39.135 --> 00:32:41.416\nfrom start to the tic function.\n\n529\n00:32:41.416 --> 00:32:45.250\nAnd if we've done it right,\ncross your fingers Daniel.\n\n530\n00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.950\n&gt;&gt; They are sufficiently crossed.\n\n531\n00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:49.150\n&gt;&gt; And we now have a timer.\n\n532\n00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.650\nAnd because I've put this in a class and\n\n533\n00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:57.350\nmade these relative references\nwithin the class, this cache DOM,\n\n534\n00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:02.610\nI can construct a bunch\nof these just like this.\n\n535\n00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.680\nIs that the div, yeah, boom.\n\n536\n00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.112\nAnd this is timer2.\n\n537\n00:33:06.112 --> 00:33:09.131\nAnd in my app,\n\n538\n00:33:09.131 --> 00:33:14.669\nI'm going to say new Timer\n\n539\n00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:19.490\n('#timer2').\n\n540\n00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:23.102\nAnd, if I've done this right,\nI have a timer here and\n\n541\n00:33:23.102 --> 00:33:25.118\nI have a separate timer here.\n\n542\n00:33:25.118 --> 00:33:28.540\nAnd if I reset this timer,\nthe other one is unaffected.\n\n543\n00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.200\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n544\n00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now if I hadn't done that and\nI had all those global variables,\n\n545\n00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.830\nyou're gonna have, like if it's timer1\ndo this, if it's timer2 do this.\n\n546\n00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.900\nBut notice,\nI get the reproducibility of this code for\n\n547\n00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.010\nfree if I organize it appropriately.\n\n548\n00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.760\nNow, is this a bunch of code?\n\n549\n00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.620\nSure, you would think timers\nwould be a little easier to\n\n550\n00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.990\nimplement than they actually are.\n\n551\n00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.640\nIs this a robust timer?\n\n552\n00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.810\nI don't know, could be iffy.\n\n553\n00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:03.849\nBut maybe seeing some of those edge cases\nwould be best left to another episode.\n\n554\n00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:06.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah cuz it's\ndefinitely working.\n\n555\n00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.660\nIt's doing as we expected.\n\n556\n00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.080\nAnd we get to reuse our code over and\nover again, as you've shown us as well.\n\n557\n00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.470\nSetting up that structure so\nthat we can do that.\n\n558\n00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:17.250\nMaking sure everything's not a global\nvariable so that we don't have to go okay,\n\n559\n00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:21.150\nlet's find all the places I put tic and\nput tic2, and all that.\n\n560\n00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.469\nThat's no fun for anyone.\n\n561\n00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:24.110\nSo Justin, very cool,\n\n562\n00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:29.080\nis there anything else that we\nneed to dive into on said topic?\n\n563\n00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.995\n&gt;&gt; Well as I said there's a few other\nthings that I wanna touch on but\n\n564\n00:34:32.995 --> 00:34:34.602\nthis has been a lot right?\n\n565\n00:34:34.602 --> 00:34:37.905\nLike are you using ES6 classes and\nall this other stuff and\n\n566\n00:34:37.905 --> 00:34:39.800\nyou moved a bunch of code around.\n\n567\n00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.370\nAnd I got scared and I kinda took a nap.\n\n568\n00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.660\nIt's all good,\nI think it's best left to maybe next time.\n\n569\n00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, well everybody out there\nchew your food sufficiently, swallow,\n\n570\n00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.580\ndigest, take it in so\nthat you can understand these things.\n\n571\n00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.530\nTake your time, walk through these\nconcepts that Justin has shown us so\n\n572\n00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.150\nthat you really understand them and\nyou grasp them very well.\n\n573\n00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.680\nThat's gonna help you\ndown the road as a coder.\n\n574\n00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.020\nThat being said Justin,\nwe thank you for joining us.\n\n575\n00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.570\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n576\n00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.020\nBut it does look like it is time for\nus to sign off.\n\n577\n00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.600\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n578\n00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n579\n00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.688\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n580\n00:35:12.688 --> 00:35:20.283\n[MUSIC]\n\n581\n00:35:20.283 --> 00:35:23.018\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

back with more on our\nintro to web development series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.380\nAnd coming back for our Part 3 on building\na cool little timer function inside of\n\n10\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.560\na web API, is our good friend, Mr.\nJustin Dennison.\n\n11\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.320\nJustin, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.940\n&gt;&gt;

here.\n\n18\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.882\nYeah, we are, we are.\n\n19\n00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:42.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Part 3 of building this timer.\n\n20\n00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.920\nWell, I showed this off, I was like,\nI need people to review this.\n\n21\n00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.490\nAnd they came back to\nme with a few nuances.\n\n22\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.630\nThey're like, I don't know.\n\n23\n00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.400\nAnd part of that is, well,\nwe had an unexpected run time.\n\n24\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.380\nKind of issue, and\nwe'll see that in just a moment.\n\n25\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.290\nAlso, they didn't like putting\nlike 30 timers on the page and\n\n26\n00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.310\nstarting them independently.\n\n27\n00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.900\nIt's really weird.\n\n28\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.160\nI don't know why they don't like that.\n\n29\n00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.720\nI like it.\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like the best API ever.\n\n30\n00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like look at this.\n\n31\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.445\nThis is amazing.\n\n32\n00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:13.370\n[INAUDIBLE] but\nyou have to appease either your boss or\n\n33\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.670\nyour customer, so we're gonna fix that.\n\n34\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.880\nAnd this one may not be quite\nas lengthy as the other ones but\n\n35\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.180\nthere is some good content right here.\n\n36\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.730\nSo, I suspect that we should\nprobably go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.980\ndive in and see what's going on here.\n\n38\n00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.290\nWell, first of, I should probably remedied\nthat a couple of timers on the page, so\n\n39\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.290\nI'm just gonna delete this and\nI also need to go and delete\n\n40\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.230\nan additional portion of the JavaScript\nand that was creating the new timer.\n\n41\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.070\nAnd I'm gonna clean up all of this code.\n\n42\n00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.600\nIt's probably not the best\nidea to have commented code.\n\n43\n00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.480\nJust kind of hanging out.\n\n44\n00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.810\nYou'll have it from time to time but\neventually you do wanna clean it up.\n\n45\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.770\nSo, I've done that clean up.\n\n46\n00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.070\nI am gonna leave this log here just,\nso I can inspect, but\n\n47\n00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.370\nI will eventually remove that aswell and\njust construct the timer.\n\n48\n00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.580\nNow, if we take this timer,\n\n49\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.820\nnotice in our constructor function we have\nset defaults for minutes and seconds.\n\n50\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.390\nI'm actually going to override those\ndefaults during construction of the timer.\n\n51\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.750\nSo, we can see, and\nwe're gonna have some weirdness here, so\n\n52\n00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.630\nI'm gonna say all right, zero minutes and\nlet's just go with five seconds.\n\n53\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.645\nAnd if we hop over into our browser, and\nwe refresh and I have to zoom in here.\n\n54\n00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:32.028\nAnd we click Start, well 0, 2,\n\n55\n00:02:32.028 --> 00:02:36.800\n1, 0 and that's not good.\n\n56\n00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.010\nI now have times that\nare non sensical in nature.\n\n57\n00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.030\nSo, how are we gonna fix that?\n\n58\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.340\nWell, I know I started the timer when I\nhit zero for both minutes and seconds.\n\n59\n00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.910\nWell, I wanna do something, all right.\n\n60\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.880\nWhere is gonna do a curl?\n\n61\n00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.060\nWhich one of this functions\nis going to affected by that?\n\n62\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.680\nAnd if I'm counting down,\n\n63\n00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.890\nyou'll notice tick is actually\ndoing the countdown, right.\n\n64\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.680\nSo, it would be nice if I could\ncheck to see Is time left 0?\n\n65\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.518\nCuz if it is the count down time is done.\n\n66\n00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:18.830\nSo if(this.timeLeft === 0) and\n\n67\n00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.360\nnotice I'm using triple equals here,\nI'm not using double equals.\n\n68\n00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.600\nI don't want any time corrosion.\n\n69\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.370\nI wanna make sure this is still a number.\n\n70\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.150\nCuz otherwise I wanna get and such.\n\n71\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.140\nSo, when the time left is 0,\nwhat do I wanna do?\n\n72\n00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.870\nWell, in fact, I wanna stop.\n\n73\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.020\nSo, this.stop, and\nis there anything else that I need to do?\n\n74\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.620\nThere is only one way to find out and\nthat is to test it.\n\n75\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.745\nSo, if I refresh and I click start.\n\n76\n00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:56.887\n4,3,2,1 and\n\n77\n00:03:56.887 --> 00:04:01.260\nwe have an overrun.\n\n78\n00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.290\nHow did that happen?\n\n79\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.000\nWell, if I look, this if statement and\n\n80\n00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.050\nthis is a common issue\nthat people encounter.\n\n81\n00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.340\nIt did stop, but it stopped a little too\nlate and that's because I added an if.\n\n82\n00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.230\nI said stop but because this second\nportion is not wrapped in an else or\n\n83\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.730\nthere's no other way that's\nkind of stopping this\n\n84\n00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.590\ntime that left in this render,\nactually runs one more time.\n\n85\n00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.810\nWell, how do I make that to that not so?\n\n86\n00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.240\nAnd probably the easiest way is\nto add an else statement and\n\n87\n00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.020\nmove this inside of the else, right?\n\n88\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.260\nSo that would change\nkind of how tick works.\n\n89\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.100\nIf there's no time left stop, otherwise go\nahead and count down and render, right.\n\n90\n00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.460\nNow let's see if that solves our problem.\n\n91\n00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.984\nIf I refresh and I click start, and\n\n92\n00:04:54.984 --> 00:04:58.109\nthere's 3,2,1.\n\n93\n00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:01.193\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n94\n00:05:01.193 --> 00:05:03.990\nSo if I reset I can count down again.\n\n95\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.310\nLet's make sure that reset\ndoesn't do some craziness here.\n\n96\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.520\nAnd, we have fixed that kind\nof runtime error, right?\n\n97\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.450\nSo, we now have a timer that counts\ndown from the constructed time.\n\n98\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.060\nIt's not quite the Pomodoro timer\nthat was originally requested.\n\n99\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.470\nIt is the idea, right?\n\n100\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.600\nIt's kind of the most basic\nidea of the Pomodoro timer.\n\n101\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.320\nBut, I had another issue.\n\n102\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.290\nSeveral people were like,\nit's kinda plain.\n\n103\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.540\nI would like for\nit to not be as plain as it is.\n\n104\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.660\nAnd I was like, I don't know if you\nwant me trying to make it pretty but\n\n105\n00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.140\nas part of web development you do\nneed to add some niceties, right?\n\n106\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.470\nAnd what you'll find is I have\nsome styling based on 100% view.\n\n107\n00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.110\nWe are currently at, I think,\nyeah, like 400% or 500%.\n\n108\n00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.120\nSo, as we do this styling\nwe're gonna have to zoom out.\n\n109\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.770\nAnd make this nice but\nit's important to know, after\n\n110\n00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.750\nyou get the functionality this is how I\ngo about developing a web application.\n\n111\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.190\nAfter you get the functionality, maybe you\nwant to, make it, a little bit prettier.\n\n112\n00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.840\nSo we'll set that up,\nwe'll get our CSS setup and\n\n113\n00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.100\nthen I'll give you some challenges.\n\n114\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.500\nMaybe you should undertake this,\nI'm getting tired.\n\n115\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.320\nIt's probably time for\nme to hand this off to someone else.\n\n116\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.140\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n117\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.650\nAnd we have our index.html, our app.js.\n\n118\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.920\nAnd in fact, CSS is typically\ncontained in some other file,\n\n119\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.180\nnamely I've named mine,\na great deal main.css.\n\n120\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.900\nThere are several conventions.\n\n121\n00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.620\nI've seen styles.css or at.css or\n\n122\n00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.540\nhaven't really seen index, haven't really\nnailed down, I typically go with main but\n\n123\n00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.640\nchoose something that makes\nsense to you and stick with it.\n\n124\n00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.200\nKeep it consistent, that's important.\n\n125\n00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.870\nNow, before we move on, I always like to\nput Just something that is in your face,\n\n126\n00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.980\noutlandish so I can check to see if\nthe CSS is being loaded on the page.\n\n127\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:16.040\nAnd I'm gonna go with background color\nof the body is, well, chartreuse, right?\n\n128\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.520\nIn your face crazy color.\n\n129\n00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.450\n&gt;&gt; Kinda hard to miss.\n\n130\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.000\n&gt;&gt; It is, and\nyou'll notice if you're using Adam,\n\n131\n00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.660\nI have this plug-in\n&gt;&gt; That actually\n\n132\n00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.730\nshows me the color as I type color\nnames and hex codes, is helpful to me.\n\n133\n00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.190\nDefinitely check on the add-ons plugins.\n\n134\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.850\nThis is why I like rich text editors,\nso definitely check that out.\n\n135\n00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.200\nAnd then in index.htlm\ntypically the css is\n\n136\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.120\nloaded as one of the first\nthings on the page.\n\n137\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.320\n&gt;&gt; At the very top, within the head tag,\nI'm gonna type link and hit Tab.\n\n138\n00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.850\nNow this works in Atom, Sublime, Visual\nStudio Code, some of those other editors.\n\n139\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.016\nAnd notice that the link says,\nrel style sheet.\n\n140\n00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:55.920\nSo that's kinda like the type.\n\n141\n00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.756\nAnd then href.\n\n142\n00:07:57.756 --> 00:07:58.915\nWhere is it located?\n\n143\n00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:01.584\nHere's the weird link.\n\n144\n00:08:01.584 --> 00:08:04.150\nYou think of hyperlinks.\n\n145\n00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.810\nBut actually, a link is linking\nanother file to this file.\n\n146\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.730\nSo you're kind of joining\nthose files together.\n\n147\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.870\nAnd I'm just going to not override link.\n\n148\n00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.020\nBut, instead, say main.css.\n\n149\n00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.290\nAnd if we've done this right.\n\n150\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.970\nWell, we will see.\n\n151\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.100\nHm, we got some issues here.\n\n152\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.050\nWe should have a body of chartreuse.\n\n153\n00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.990\nWhy is it not chartreuse?\n\n154\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.030\nAnd in the Chrome dev tools.\n\n155\n00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.880\nIf you ever have CSS misbehaving or\nJavaScript misbehaving.\n\n156\n00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.310\nYou come over to the network tab.\n\n157\n00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.590\nAnd you see, okay.\n\n158\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.340\nWell, let's see here.\n\n159\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.085\nFinished, status.\n\n160\n00:08:44.662 --> 00:08:46.124\nI have these loaded.\n\n161\n00:08:46.124 --> 00:08:51.260\nIf I refresh,\neverything looks to have been loaded.\n\n162\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.960\nAnd background color, chartreuse.\n\n163\n00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.990\nSo what's going on?\n\n164\n00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.950\nWe've got to do a little\nbit of debugging here.\n\n165\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.820\nSo I have main.css.\n\n166\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.520\nThere it is.\n\n167\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.180\nBut why is it not rendering?\n\n168\n00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.680\nWhy is it.\n\n169\n00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.800\nThat's kind of odd.\n\n170\n00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.470\nAnd so\nwe need to do some additional inspection.\n\n171\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:17.090\nIf I click on main.css, there's my\nbackground color that is showing.\n\n172\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.430\nMaybe I misspelled chartreuse.\n\n173\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.230\nMaybe the plugin is lying to me.\n\n174\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.000\nSo let's try something else, red.\n\n175\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.560\nBackground color red.\n\n176\n00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.400\nAnd, hm.\n\n177\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.960\nWell, in fact, what we would think is,\nthese are in strings, right?\n\n178\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.640\nIn CSS.\n\n179\n00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.290\nBut in CSS, they are just plain text.\n\n180\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.006\nI don't wrap them in strings.\n\n181\n00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:47.860\nAnd if I do that, that is a common\nerror I see with these CSS colors.\n\n182\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.328\nPeople will put these with quotes around,\nbecause you've been so used to JavaScript.\n\n183\n00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:54.160\nAnd you're like.\n\n184\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.460\nWell, obviously,\na word like that needs to be in quotes.\n\n185\n00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.150\nPut it in quotes.\n\n186\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.730\nGuess what?\nIt doesn't work.\n\n187\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.700\nBut now we know for\ncertain that our CSS is linked.\n\n188\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.400\nAnd we can apply our styling.\n\n189\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.490\nSo we're good to go.\n\n190\n00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:12.960\nBe very careful about the syntax\ndifferences between CSS and JavaScript.\n\n191\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.960\nBecause there are curly braces and\nsemicolons and colons.\n\n192\n00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.670\nYou're like, they're kind of the same.\n\n193\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.850\nThey are, but they're not all the same.\n\n194\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.640\n&gt;&gt; Justin, I would assume this\nis something that probably\n\n195\n00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.530\nhappens quite a bit.\n\n196\n00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:28.590\nBecause, like you said, you're dealing\nwith multiple different languages.\n\n197\n00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.906\nAnd you get used to doing.\n\n198\n00:10:29.906 --> 00:10:33.320\nYou're probably going to be working in\nJavaScript more often than you are so\n\n199\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.600\nmuch HTML or CSS.\n\n200\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.110\nSo you think, yeah.\n\n201\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.710\nI'm just going to crank this out.\n\n202\n00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.610\nAnd then you're staring at a screen for\nsix hours going, why?\n\n203\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.374\nWhy isn't this working?\n\n204\n00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:42.060\nYeah.\n\n205\n00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.628\nAnd then you go, yeah, that's right.\n\n206\n00:10:43.628 --> 00:10:44.520\nIt's HTML.\nYeah.\n\n207\n00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.242\nIs that something that does happen a lot?\n\n208\n00:10:46.242 --> 00:10:47.180\n[INAUDIBLE]?\n\n209\n00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.018\n&gt;&gt; It does happen.\n\n210\n00:10:48.018 --> 00:10:52.580\nAnd I will say, in web development,\nyou kind of have your bent, right?\n\n211\n00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.574\nThere are people who\nare designer developers.\n\n212\n00:10:55.574 --> 00:10:57.703\nThey will build nice pretty UIs.\n\n213\n00:10:57.703 --> 00:10:59.956\nAnd then there are people like me.\n\n214\n00:10:59.956 --> 00:11:02.540\nWho, their focus is function over form.\n\n215\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.793\nI'm not going to try to hide that.\n\n216\n00:11:04.793 --> 00:11:09.553\nI can make things look, if I'm giving\na mock up, how they're supposed to.\n\n217\n00:11:09.553 --> 00:11:13.420\nBut coming up with the ideas\nstraight out of my head.\n\n218\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.002\nSadly, I let that part of my brain\nkind of atrophy over the few years.\n\n219\n00:11:17.002 --> 00:11:19.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I need to work on that.\n\n220\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.860\nSo these things do happen.\n\n221\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.330\nAnd you'll find you gravitate\ntoward a certain subsection.\n\n222\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.400\nI know people who really enjoy CSS.\n\n223\n00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.570\nAnd they do a great deal of that.\n\n224\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.160\nBut they don't necessarily\ndo a lot of JavaScript.\n\n225\n00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.800\nOther than the minor\ninteractions that they want.\n\n226\n00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.550\nI know people who really love JavaScript.\n\n227\n00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.960\nAnd maybe they don't\ngravitate towards CSS.\n\n228\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.290\nAnd there are people who enjoy both.\n\n229\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.410\nAnd if that's your goal,\nthen definitely try that out.\n\n230\n00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.670\n&gt;&gt; But when it comes to art,\nI would always say to.\n\n231\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.430\nIf you're not the artist, per se.\n\n232\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.980\nYou don't have that design.\n\n233\n00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.300\nThat stylistic part of\nyour brain is atrophied,\n\n234\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.680\nlike Justin,\n&gt;&gt; To come up with\n\n235\n00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.978\nsomething that looks good\nthat you do on everything.\n\n236\n00:11:56.978 --> 00:11:58.710\nYeah.\nAnd go, well at least it looks pretty.\n\n237\n00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.270\nAnd someone that's\na designer can change it.\n\n238\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.290\nIt doesn't look so vanilla.\n\n239\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n240\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.537\nAnd I'm going to use some pretty in\nyour face colors just to accentuate some\n\n241\n00:12:07.537 --> 00:12:08.040\nthings.\n\n242\n00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.560\nI don't know if I would\nnecessarily deploy this.\n\n243\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.032\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to\nsee his personal site.\n\n244\n00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:14.432\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just a bunch of giffys.\n\n245\n00:12:14.432 --> 00:12:15.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, blinking.\nYeah, it's never. [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.980\n&gt;&gt; No it's not.\n\n247\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.455\nJust so we're clear.\n\n248\n00:12:18.455 --> 00:12:20.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n249\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.510\nget the CSS kind of banged out.\n\n250\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.150\nAnd see how that changes our look.\n\n251\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.860\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that.\n\n252\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.240\nSo I'm actually going to\nkeep the background color.\n\n253\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.230\nBut instead of chartreuse,\nI'm gonna use rgba.\n\n254\n00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.640\nWhich is a function in CSS where\nI can denote the red, green,\n\n255\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.280\nblue, and the alpha channel.\n\n256\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.170\nSo essentially.\n\n257\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.970\nthe opacity.\n\n258\n00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.600\nAnd I'm going to set that to 0.7.\n\n259\n00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.510\nThat runs from 0 to 1.\n\n260\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.520\nThese other numbers run from 0 to 255.\n\n261\n00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.040\nBecause you get 256 variations.\n\n262\n00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.790\nOr kind of like intensity values for\nred, green, and blue.\n\n263\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.730\nThere are other ways to define colors.\n\n264\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.510\nBut notice,\n\n265\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.680\nI now have this kind of interesting\ncharcoal gray color for the background.\n\n266\n00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.180\nLet's go ahead and look at this container.\n\n267\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.870\nSo within the HTML, I have this\n\n268\n00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:17.080\ncontainer div that has everything\nelse contained within it.\n\n269\n00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:22.570\nI'm going to use this container div\njust to set up some basic arrangement.\n\n270\n00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:28.960\nI am using a new positioning or\ndisplay type called flex for Flexbox.\n\n271\n00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.020\nIt's something I've been\nplaying around with.\n\n272\n00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.300\nDo realize that not all browsers\nhave full implementations for this.\n\n273\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.080\nSo your mileage may vary.\n\n274\n00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.380\nDefinitely need to use\nan up-to-date browser.\n\n275\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.165\nSo I'm going to put display flex.\n\n276\n00:13:40.165 --> 00:13:42.490\nAnd I want all of\nthe items to be centered.\n\n277\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:51.750\nAnd I want the content within\nthis item to also be centered.\n\n278\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.020\nThis seems redundant.\n\n279\n00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.700\nBut it helps make sure everything\nis centered within the container.\n\n280\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.510\nAnd then, beyond that,\nI'm gonna select the #timer.\n\n281\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.880\nAlso make it a flexbox parent.\n\n282\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.475\nOr what contains flex type things.\n\n283\n00:14:07.475 --> 00:14:09.720\nAnd flex is short for flexible.\n\n284\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.400\nIt will help rearrange and shrink and\ngrow if you spend the time.\n\n285\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.860\nI'm going to keep the width to auto.\n\n286\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.570\nAlign items is also\ngoing to be center here.\n\n287\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.655\nMy minimum height.\n\n288\n00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:30.118\nSo I don't want my height to ever squash\nbelow this level, is going to be 20 m.\n\n289\n00:14:30.118 --> 00:14:34.600\nAnd background color for the timer.\n\n290\n00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.590\nThe actual timer object is.\n\n291\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.010\nAnd I always like colors like this.\n\n292\n00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.440\nBecause you're like,\nwhy is that a default css color?\n\n293\n00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.630\nLightsalmon.\n\n294\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.310\nIt works well with the charcoal grey,\nI think.\n\n295\n00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:47.430\n&gt;&gt; But very soft.\n\n296\n00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.240\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n297\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.500\nAnd then I'm going to also justify\nthe content here as a center.\n\n298\n00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:54.910\nMaybe, if I can spell center.\n\n299\n00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.700\nAnd then flex direction.\n\n300\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.772\nI'm going to make that columns.\n\n301\n00:14:59.772 --> 00:15:04.380\nSo I actually don't want the things\nwithin it to run from side to side.\n\n302\n00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.660\nI want them to run up and down.\n\n303\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.930\nSo I can change how those run.\n\n304\n00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.860\nDespite the index.html kind of\nhaving this default behavior\n\n305\n00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.150\nof running from side to side.\n\n306\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.403\nWithin that, I do want to.\n\n307\n00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.560\nModify the display, right?\n\n308\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.660\nThe display is what contains minutes and\nseconds within it.\n\n309\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.534\nAnd then display Is also going to be.\n\n310\n00:15:34.336 --> 00:15:37.460\nA flex type, if I can spell.\n\n311\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.650\nAnd then the font size.\n\n312\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.320\nI want to make the font size really huge.\n\n313\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.940\nBecause I want the timer in your face.\n\n314\n00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.960\n&gt;&gt; Can you make it look\nlike the Star Trek timer?\n\n315\n00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.569\nThat'd be awesome.\n\n316\n00:15:46.569 --> 00:15:48.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; MIght need some custom fonts for\n\n317\n00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:48.880\nthat, Daniel.\n\n318\n00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Might need a few of those, yeah.\n\n319\n00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.774\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm also going to\njustify the content and align items.\n\n320\n00:15:54.774 --> 00:15:57.629\nNow this is, just to be very transparent.\n\n321\n00:15:57.629 --> 00:16:02.208\nThere are multitudes of ways\nto accomplish the same look.\n\n322\n00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:04.402\nProbably with the reduction of code.\n\n323\n00:16:04.402 --> 00:16:09.550\nI'm really good in reducing\nthe amount of code that in my JS.\n\n324\n00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:16.510\nBut sometimes, I like to be more kind\nof specific even though I see these\n\n325\n00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.890\nline items and just by content, we keep\nseeing that over and over and over again.\n\n326\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.510\nAnd there are better ways to do this.\n\n327\n00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.280\nBut I'm chunking this\nindividually just to be\n\n328\n00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.490\nvery forthcoming with this\nis what we're doing now.\n\n329\n00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.800\nThis is what we're doing now.\n\n330\n00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.530\nInstead of using complex CSS selectors.\n\n331\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:37.420\nAnd then within the controls,\nwhat do I want to do?\n\n332\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.868\nWell first off I'm gonna move that up\nthere, and I also want display a flex,\n\n333\n00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:46.641\nI want justify-content, and\nnow I want space-around.\n\n334\n00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:51.167\nSpace-around will actually kinda divvy\nup the space around the elements\n\n335\n00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:53.430\ncontained within the controls div.\n\n336\n00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:01.290\nI wanna align the items as a whole\nto the center and then flex wrap.\n\n337\n00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:08.149\nI want to wrap them if the container\nkinda shrinks and expands.\n\n338\n00:17:08.149 --> 00:17:11.686\nAnd then finally our .button.\n\n339\n00:17:13.844 --> 00:17:20.962\nSo our .button I want a width of 4em which\nis based on the default font pixels size,\n\n340\n00:17:20.962 --> 00:17:25.350\nthe default pixel size of your size for\nthe screen.\n\n341\n00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:27.800\nI said size like four times.\n\n342\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.740\nLet's let's go back and\ntalk about that again.\n\n343\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.875\n&gt;&gt; Genius the source.\n\n344\n00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:34.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right the size which is the size in\n\n345\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.570\nsome more sciences.\n\n346\n00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:42.340\nSo is based on root element fun\npixel size if I'm not mistaken and\n\n347\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.990\njust to be absolutely sure\nlet's check the documentation.\n\n348\n00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.343\nI'm always big fun of documentation.\n\n349\n00:17:48.343 --> 00:17:49.290\nSo M.\n\n350\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:49.790\nMDN.\n\n351\n00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.830\nAnd not the M tag, but\ninstead font size might get us there.\n\n352\n00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.712\nBut I actually saw another one.\n\n353\n00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:03.100\nA-ha, here we go, Ems.\n\n354\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.130\nAnother way of setting\nfont sizes is with values.\n\n355\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.310\nThe size of an value is dynamic when\ndefining the font size property.\n\n356\n00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.430\nIf you haven't seen the font-size anywhere\nin the page then its the browser's default\n\n357\n00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.662\nwhich is often 16 pixels,\nnotice this often.\n\n358\n00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:18.855\nSo 1em would be 16 pixels.\n\n359\n00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:21.370\n2ems would be 32.\n\n360\n00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:26.980\nIf I wanted 24,\nI would get well kinda like 1.5, right?\n\n361\n00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.960\nSo, that would be 1em and half another.\n\n362\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.690\nAnd so I can get this dynamic settings\nbased on the default size of the browser.\n\n363\n00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.010\nWhy is it good to you to\nuse these relative units?\n\n364\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.900\nWell, if I put this in the mobile phone,\n\n365\n00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:44.170\nthe default pixel size maybe different\nthan a browser that's on a desktop.\n\n366\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.130\nSo keep that in mind and I was right,\n\n367\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.185\nthough I explained it very\npoorly the first pass around.\n\n368\n00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:57.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then I also want font-size 4em.\n\n369\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:03.580\nI want those fonts inside of those\nbuttons are very large also.\n\n370\n00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.270\nI want just a little bit of\nmargin around those borders so\n\n371\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.730\nthey don't stack next to each other.\n\n372\n00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:20.190\nFont-family, Helvetica Neue.\n\n373\n00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.530\nAnd I'm gonna create a backup of Serif.\n\n374\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.400\nAny time you're defining a font-family,\n\n375\n00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.930\nyou should always have at least\none backup, preferably two.\n\n376\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.590\nSo this would be the first preference and\nthen the secondary.\n\n377\n00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.330\nAnd then you could have a third.\n\n378\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.460\nThe reason being is Helvetica Neue,\nI think originated on OSX.\n\n379\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.240\nI think it has then since propagated.\n\n380\n00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.750\nBut is not guaranteed to\nbe within a system font.\n\n381\n00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.770\nAnd then the appearance, which is going\nto help with removing some of that weird\n\n382\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:53.410\nbutton that default giant button\nthat's gonna remove the box shadow.\n\n383\n00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.600\nAnd I'm going to remove the border.\n\n384\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.410\nI like this flat button UI.\n\n385\n00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.580\nAnd the border radius,\nI'm gonna set that to zero and\n\n386\n00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.910\nthen the background color well I'm\ngonna set that to light yellow.\n\n387\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:18.610\nSo a very in your face timer that way you\ncan't forget that timing is occurring.\n\n388\n00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.240\nSo if we've done this correctly\nwe have a giant timer.\n\n389\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.490\nNotice that since we're at 500% and\n\n390\n00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.800\nwe've set this to standard 100%\nzoom we got some weirdness.\n\n391\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.250\nSo let's zoom that out, And\n\n392\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.850\nnow we actually have\na somewhat nice looking timer.\n\n393\n00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.710\nI think it's nice looking.\n\n394\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.257\nWe all have different opinions.\n\n395\n00:20:37.257 --> 00:20:40.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's that whole\nterm subjectivism, right?\n\n396\n00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is subjective, obviously.\n\n397\n00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.110\nI think it looks nice.\n\n398\n00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:49.600\nIt definitely has a more stylistic\nlook to it than what we had previously\n\n399\n00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.090\nwhich was very 1995-ish.\n\n400\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:51.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n401\n00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.700\nI can understand why people\nwould want to see something\n\n402\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.548\nthat seems more modern to them.\n\n403\n00:20:56.548 --> 00:21:00.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so I like the look\nof it if we get down to 100%,\n\n404\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.610\nyou actually notice that these buttons\nkind of start wrapping around, and\n\n405\n00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:08.720\nif we get down on to a mobile view,\nthen we have kind of,\n\n406\n00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.930\nI could probably make this a little\nbigger, but it stacks in a column, so\n\n407\n00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.440\nI could use it on a mobile phone.\n\n408\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.570\nSo that's a targeting those mobile\nplatforms cuz a lot of us actually\n\n409\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.190\nbrowse the Internet on a phone.\n\n410\n00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.050\n&gt;&gt; I don't think my wife touches her\ncomputer hardly through out the day.\n\n411\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.940\nShe's all her surfing on her phone,\njust about.\n\n412\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.530\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nSo\n\n413\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:32.720\nI think we're at a good stopping point but\nI have a few challenges for you.\n\n414\n00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.170\nIf you so decide to undertake them.\n\n415\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.960\nActually let's see if you\ncould add the ability to have\n\n416\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.980\na five minute break, right?\n\n417\n00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.050\nInstead of always being 25 minutes.\n\n418\n00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.296\nHow would you change this to go 25, 5?\n\n419\n00:21:44.296 --> 00:21:49.160\nOnce you get that,\nthen you can start counting the breaks.\n\n420\n00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.470\nAfter you're able to count the breaks,\n\n421\n00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.749\nafter every third break instead of a 5\nminute break, make a 15 minute break.\n\n422\n00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.330\nSo there's a couple of things to take\naway that I haven't shown you but\n\n423\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.940\nwould definitely behoove\nyou to try to undertake,\n\n424\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.730\nkind of expand your mind a little bit.\n\n425\n00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.500\nAnd don't be afraid to break things.\n\n426\n00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.590\nIt's totally okay if\nyou're like this is broke.\n\n427\n00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.140\nStart over.\nI can't tell you how many\n\n428\n00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:12.940\ntimes I've started over.\n\n429\n00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:18.140\nThe very first program I ever wrote was a\ncalculator and the C programming language.\n\n430\n00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:18.880\nI rewrote it 4 times.\n\n431\n00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.700\nCuz the first three times I\nwould hit things like 3+2 is 29.\n\n432\n00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.730\nThat's not right.\n\n433\n00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:30.350\nSo I messed up a bunch and\nit was incredibly frustrating,\n\n434\n00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:35.100\nbut the ability to persist\nwill definitely take you far.\n\n435\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:40.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always find myself writing the\ncode for something cuz I write in bash And\n\n436\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.130\na little bit in other languages and\nI think this is gonna be beautiful,\n\n437\n00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.490\nthis is gonna be fantastic and\nit's not working.\n\n438\n00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:47.960\nWhy is it not working?\n\n439\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:54.370\nAnd I'll open up another tab in Atom and\njust make a basic function go,\n\n440\n00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.070\nwalk through my logic,\nsee why that's breaking down and\n\n441\n00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.870\ngo okay I see where the problem is\nthen I go and I fix my actual code.\n\n442\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.980\nSo I tend to rewrite it as well,\njust in a different way.\n\n443\n00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.620\nYeah that's not a lot of fun and\ndefinitely gets you the experience and\n\n444\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.560\nto recognize where your\nproblems are gonna lie.\n\n445\n00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.950\n&gt;&gt; And I think the big issue is a lot of\npeople are like well that's slow going,\n\n446\n00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.320\nand it is to begin with.\n\n447\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:23.240\nBut as you develop experience, I will\ntell you a single year of doing that,\n\n448\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.960\nlet's just say an hour a day.\n\n449\n00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.500\nYou will find a significant difference\nhow quickly you can attack and\n\n450\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.680\nimplement a solution versus a year prior.\n\n451\n00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.000\nSo, a year prior like know\nhow to make a variable.\n\n452\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then, a year later,\n\n453\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.890\nyou'll like, I got this.\n\n454\n00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.210\nSo, definitely persist,\n\n455\n00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.190\nbe diligent, and look at those details,\nand use your tools, right.\n\n456\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, Justin, well, looks like\nwe've rounded out this little mini series\n\n457\n00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.140\nthat we have going here\nwith building our timer.\n\n458\n00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.324\nBut it was time well spent,\nright, to not make a pun, but-\n\n459\n00:23:59.324 --> 00:24:00.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.680\n&gt;&gt; That being said,\n\n461\n00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.070\nwe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n462\n00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.290\nJustin, thanks for joining us today.\n\n463\n00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.300\nBut it looks like it is that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n464\n00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.960\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n465\n00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.843\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n466\n00:24:10.843 --> 00:24:17.025\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n467\n00:24:17.025 --> 00:24:19.855\n[MUSIC]\n\n468\n00:24:19.855 --> 00:24:25.640\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV\n\n",

--> 00:00:06.724\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:08.448\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:10.500\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.560\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.643\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:19.029\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n10\n00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.246\nwe are back with more on our\nintro to web development series.\n\n11\n00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:25.870\nAnother one of our wonderful\nlets build it type of shows.\n\n12\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.660\nAnd joining us in the studio to\nshow us what we're gonna build,\n\n13\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.970\nour good friend Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n14\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.540\nWelcome sir, how's it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.410\n&gt;&gt; It's going well Daniel.\n\n16\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.040\nHow are you today?\n\n17\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.060\n&gt;&gt; I'm fantastic, thank you.\n\n18\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.740\n&gt;&gt; That's always good to hear.\n\n19\n00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm big proponent of a,\nthe let's build a.\n\n20\n00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.060\nI like the let's build, those shows.\n\n21\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.380\nAnd typically in this intro applications,\nthey're.\n\n22\n00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.140\nThey're small.\n\n23\n00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.470\nThey're not overly complex.\n\n24\n00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.180\nWell, they actually end up being\nmore complex than one would think.\n\n25\n00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.290\nYou're like this is easy.\n\n26\n00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:53.852\nIt's not actually easy as I anticipated.\n\n27\n00:00:53.852 --> 00:00:55.109\n&gt;&gt; Well logic involved.\n\n28\n00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:55.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.600\n&gt;&gt; And thinking my brain hurts.\n\n30\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.840\nSo today we're actually\ngonna build hangman.\n\n31\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.800\nNow, part of the reason of why we're gonna\ndo this number one I think everybody or\n\n32\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.870\nmost people have played hangman or\nsome version of this in their life.\n\n33\n00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.720\nBut also we need to know,\nwe've been doing a lot of point and\n\n34\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.220\nclick events, event handling.\n\n35\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.390\nBut we wanna be able to handle\nkeyboard events, right.\n\n36\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.330\nI wanna be able to hit numbers and\nletters and see those actually respond,\n\n37\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.390\nbe the input that people have for\na particular web application.\n\n38\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.760\nAnd I've used web applications where\nthere's a bunch of keyboard shortcuts,\n\n39\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.590\nthat you can navigate through the webpage.\n\n40\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.250\nSometimes those are nice.\n\n41\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.980\nSometimes they're I'm trying like\nprint and somehow I accidentally\n\n42\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.270\nlike went back four pages and\nselected yes and some sort of it.\n\n43\n00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.620\nAnd I'm like that was unforeseen.\n\n44\n00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.160\nBut, our goal is to\nhandle keyboard events.\n\n45\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.660\nAnd so I think we need to go ahead and\nstart building hangman.\n\n46\n00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.330\nAnd let's just see how complex it gets.\n\n47\n00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.539\nSo I gonna go ahead and\ndive down in the editor here.\n\n48\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.700\nAnd so our editor's open, our browser's\nopen but we do need to set up a project\n\n49\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.260\nfolder and let's go ahead and\nmake a new folder for hangman.\n\n50\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.060\nAnd I'm going to open\nthat folder in my editor.\n\n51\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.090\nSo add project folder, and\nfind the hang man folder.\n\n52\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.710\nHere we are.\n\n53\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.533\nAnd within that folder, I'm going to add\nour kind of standards here, index.html.\n\n54\n00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:31.510\nMake sure you get those file extensions\nright in your rich text editors.\n\n55\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.280\nIf you don't then,\nsome of your syntax highlighting and\n\n56\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.139\nthose helpful tools that you find that\nare available will not always work.\n\n57\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.613\nSo we have index.html.\n\n58\n00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:46.298\nWe have app.js and I'm going to ahead and\nadd a main.css because\n\n59\n00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:51.084\nsometimes I have to use styling to\nhelp me see things on the screen.\n\n60\n00:02:51.084 --> 00:02:53.597\nBecause [INAUDIBLE] net is outlined and\n\n61\n00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:58.530\nkind of arranged in a manner that\nIs useful to the application.\n\n62\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.340\nSo I have these three files,\nwe're good to go.\n\n63\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.995\nLet's go ahead and add our HTML,\nso HTML enter, and Hangman.\n\n64\n00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:11.246\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\nlink up our main.css and\n\n65\n00:03:11.246 --> 00:03:15.914\nat the bottom right before\nthe end of our body.\n\n66\n00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:21.086\nAdd our app.js, now in app.js,\njust to make sure\n\n67\n00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:27.118\neverything is working and\nhooked up, let's say working.\n\n68\n00:03:27.118 --> 00:03:31.637\nAnd in main.css,\nlet's just add one of those weird,\n\n69\n00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:38.526\ncrazy styles such as background-color of\ntomato, which is actually a CSS color.\n\n70\n00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:44.144\nI have this weird fixation with the odd\npredefined CSS colors like tomato,\n\n71\n00:03:44.144 --> 00:03:47.097\nsalmon, light salmon, chartreuse.\n\n72\n00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:48.717\nI do love them.\n\n73\n00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:53.164\nSo if we have this all worked up\nwhen we open this blank index.html.\n\n74\n00:03:53.164 --> 00:03:54.354\nBlank, right?\n\n75\n00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:55.595\nIt's not gonna show\nanything on the screen.\n\n76\n00:03:55.595 --> 00:04:01.464\nThen we wanna make sure all of those files\nare good to go before we dive into our\n\n77\n00:04:01.464 --> 00:04:07.780\napplication process because if we\ndon't we may overlook something.\n\n78\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.590\nAnd when we overlook, sometimes you\nget really frustrated because you're\n\n79\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.050\nlike I didn't actually include my ab.js\nand my application's not working, or.\n\n80\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.610\nI didn't include my CSS file and\nnone of my styling's working.\n\n81\n00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.410\nNow that is a pretty intense red.\n\n82\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.320\nWe will probably remove that very shortly.\n\n83\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.550\nBut, I do want to open the Chrome depth\ntools and I can get there through\n\n84\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.730\nMore Tools, Developer Tools,\nI can also right click and inspect.\n\n85\n00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.000\nBut, I tend to like keyboard shortcuts,\nbecause I use them very often.\n\n86\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.270\nAnd on Mac, it's Alt-Cmd-I.\n\n87\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.750\nTypically, we're in the console.\n\n88\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.650\nAnd notice it says, working.\n\n89\n00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.150\nThat's good.\n\n90\n00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.570\nBut, if I want to make sure\nthat all of these are loading.\n\n91\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.700\nIf I come to the Network tab,\nand I hit refresh.\n\n92\n00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.864\nYou'll notice the three files are,\nin fact, listed index.html,\n\n93\n00:05:02.864 --> 00:05:05.910\nmain.css and app.js.\n\n94\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.370\nAnd since they're listed,\nit has made that request.\n\n95\n00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.680\nNotice we're loading these\nfrom the local file system.\n\n96\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.940\nAs we build more complex things\nthat maybe reach out and\n\n97\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.920\ngrab resources from other places.\n\n98\n00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.120\nThis will actually take longer than three\nand one milliseconds because you have to,\n\n99\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.170\nactually have to make a network request,\ngo out on the internet and get those back.\n\n100\n00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.980\nBut, it looks like were good to go so\n\n101\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.800\nno better time than\nthe present to get started.\n\n102\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.670\nI am gonna remove the tomato thing though.\n\n103\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.519\nI'm just going leave that as white.\n\n104\n00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.780\nAnd that way it's not crazy.\n\n105\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.380\nAlright.\n&gt;&gt; Bull, seeing red?\n\n106\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWoo.\n\n107\n00:05:45.494 --> 00:05:47.620\nAlright, so what do we need to do?\n\n108\n00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.740\nI like to start with my layout first,\nand kind of plan what I'm going to do.\n\n109\n00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.860\nSo, if we remember Hangman,\nwe're given spaces\n\n110\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.310\nand we guess letters and\nthen after so many guesses.\n\n111\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.540\nRight.\nWe're not going to draw all the depiction\n\n112\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.965\nof the gallows and such.\n\n113\n00:06:08.965 --> 00:06:11.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But essentially, we have so\n\n114\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.700\nmany guesses.\n\n115\n00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.640\nAnd then after that number of guesses,\nyou lose.\n\n116\n00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.090\nOr if you guess the word, you're correct.\n\n117\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.410\nThere's various names\nif this game goes by.\n\n118\n00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.950\nAnd we're going to reduce this not to,\nto draw in the picture.\n\n119\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.620\nBut what is the core idea, right?\n\n120\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.460\nYou get guesses and you get a random word,\nand you get spaces.\n\n121\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.850\nAnd when you guess a letter correct.\n\n122\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.080\nWell, it shows the letter.\n\n123\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.150\nAnd when you do not guess correctly,\nit counts against you.\n\n124\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150\nAll right,\nnow I know that seems like a lot.\n\n125\n00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.550\nBut it boils down a great deal\nfrom what you had to worry about.\n\n126\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.486\nTypically someone is making\nup the word for you,\n\n127\n00:06:47.486 --> 00:06:51.718\nbut we're going to have to figure out\na way for the computer to do that.\n\n128\n00:06:51.718 --> 00:06:55.454\nSo, that may be our first undertaking,\nforewarning,\n\n129\n00:06:55.454 --> 00:06:59.640\nthere may be a little bit\nof math involved in that.\n\n130\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.810\nBut it will be okay,\nwe'll work through it line by line, and\n\n131\n00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.400\nit's not too horrible once you kind\nof break it down one at a time.\n\n132\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.460\nSo, if we hop back in here and\nthink about our layout,\n\n133\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.800\nwhat do we want our layout to be?\n\n134\n00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.350\nWell, I always start.\n\n135\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.310\nWith some kind of containing element.\n\n136\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.920\nNow I may have a container on the outside\nof that for styling purposes, but for\n\n137\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.500\nnow this is just the app.\n\n138\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.212\nAnd I can call this app,\n\n139\n00:07:31.212 --> 00:07:35.450\nI can call this hangman, or\nI could say, guess the word.\n\n140\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.200\nWe should use appropriate CSS\ntitling here, so guess the word.\n\n141\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.470\nWe could do that but\nI'm just gonna say app\n\n142\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.350\nbecause this is a convention you\nwill see in other frameworks so\n\n143\n00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.570\nit's nice to be used to this and\nsee where this idea originates from.\n\n144\n00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.413\nSo within that div what do I want?\n\n145\n00:07:53.413 --> 00:07:58.743\nI want two sections, and\nI want a section for\n\n146\n00:07:58.743 --> 00:08:02.350\nletters and I want a section.\n\n147\n00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.087\nFour guesses, and that's all I need right,\n\n148\n00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:10.700\nnow what do I mean by letters?\n\n149\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.605\nThat's gonna be the space that\nrepresent the letters of the words\n\n150\n00:08:14.605 --> 00:08:19.078\nthat you're trying to guess, and\nthe guesses is gonna give you feedback on\n\n151\n00:08:19.078 --> 00:08:21.776\nhow many guesses have\nyou made at this point.\n\n152\n00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:26.480\nNotice that this is very\nsparse as far as layout and\n\n153\n00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.633\nHTML, because most of this\nhas to be dynamic, right?\n\n154\n00:08:31.633 --> 00:08:37.904\nNumber of letters is going to be dependent\non, in fact, the word that we did,\n\n155\n00:08:37.904 --> 00:08:44.140\nor we randomly choose to split up\ninto spaces, but also the guesses.\n\n156\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.510\nWell the guesses have to be\nupdated fairly regularly.\n\n157\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.675\nAnd we could type a few things out and\nput a span there.\n\n158\n00:08:50.675 --> 00:08:54.290\nBut maybe we'll just make\nthat completely dynamic.\n\n159\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.970\nSo there's not a lot of html,\n\n160\n00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.520\nbut that means that our JavaScript's\ngonna have to pick up the slack.\n\n161\n00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.430\nSo if we think about our\nJavaScript well a JavaScript is\n\n162\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.457\nsame kind of thought\nprocesses as has always been.\n\n163\n00:09:09.457 --> 00:09:13.377\nLet's see, well there is a few\nthings that I need to know,\n\n164\n00:09:13.377 --> 00:09:17.700\nnumber one like the maximum number\nof guesses that someone would\n\n165\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.361\nbe allowed,so I'm say MAX_GUESSES and\nlet's just set that at 3.\n\n166\n00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:28.187\nNow, notice I used a const, and I used\nuppercase all throughout the word and\n\n167\n00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:32.102\nunderscores, and\nthat's a naming convention for\n\n168\n00:09:32.102 --> 00:09:35.940\nconstants that some people\nuse that you will see.\n\n169\n00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.000\nNot everybody uses those, but you should\nbe aware that, typically what this means\n\n170\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.660\nwhen it's named like this, all uppercase\nwith underscores, is there should be\n\n171\n00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.970\nan unchanged value that is used as like\na placeholder for some other value.\n\n172\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.970\nIf I put three throughout my application,\nwe'll that's really hard to reason about.\n\n173\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.020\nBut now, if everywhere I needed three and\n\n174\n00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.500\nit was representative of a max number\nof guesses, this reads a lot better.\n\n175\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.571\nSo don't hard code values if you can,\n\n176\n00:10:01.571 --> 00:10:04.429\nstore them in a variable\nthat has a meaningful name.\n\n177\n00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:05.530\nWhat else do we want?\n\n178\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:12.844\nWell for now,\nlet's just create a list of words.\n\n179\n00:10:12.844 --> 00:10:19.991\nOkay, so words, let's start with acres,\n\n180\n00:10:19.991 --> 00:10:25.220\nexist, mission, and carrot.\n\n181\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.500\nSo, right now our hangman is\ngonna be really easy to gain\n\n182\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.490\nbecause we only have four words right.\n\n183\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.071\n&gt;&gt; They are not the most complex\nwords on the planet, either-\n\n184\n00:10:33.071 --> 00:10:34.870\n&gt;&gt; No, no they are not.\n\n185\n00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.560\nSo, right, R-S-T-L-N-E.\n\n186\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.244\nSo, always go with R-S-T-L-N-E.\n\n187\n00:10:39.244 --> 00:10:41.435\nBut, we only get three guess, so\n\n188\n00:10:41.435 --> 00:10:47.132\nreducing the number of guessing can\nincrease kinda the difficulty level here.\n\n189\n00:10:47.132 --> 00:10:50.446\nAnd then,\nwe need to keep count of how many\n\n190\n00:10:50.446 --> 00:10:54.443\nguesses people have kind of undertaken,\nright?\n\n191\n00:10:54.443 --> 00:10:57.350\nSo guessCount is 0, right?\n\n192\n00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.600\nWhen the application starts,\nyou have made no guesses right now.\n\n193\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.938\nSo we'll start that at 0 that's\nour initialization stage.\n\n194\n00:11:04.938 --> 00:11:13.410\nAnd then we need to also get a random word\non page load, from this list of words.\n\n195\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.930\nSo, we could do a lot of\nlogic right here at the top,\n\n196\n00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:24.420\nbut we're already in the point of\nmaybe needing a function, right?\n\n197\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.193\nI'm grabbing to that array and\nI return a random value from that array.\n\n198\n00:11:28.193 --> 00:11:33.019\nAnd then, well we'll come back\nto what we need to do next,\n\n199\n00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:37.350\nlet's go ahead and\nget that random word function.\n\n200\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:44.283\nSo function getRandomWord,\nAnd that takes a wordList or\n\n201\n00:11:44.283 --> 00:11:49.217\nin JavaScript,\na more apt name would be a wordArray.\n\n202\n00:11:49.217 --> 00:11:53.430\nAnd notice I put words here, but\nthis is in fact a wordArray.\n\n203\n00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.190\nAnd how do we get the random,\nlike a random word out of that?\n\n204\n00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.000\nWell, I need a random index, right?\n\n205\n00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.608\nSo if I could generate some\nnumber between 0 and 3,\n\n206\n00:12:06.608 --> 00:12:11.970\nthen I can just use that number\nto grab a word and return them.\n\n207\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:12.979\nSo how do I make a randomIndex?\n\n208\n00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:19.860\nSo randomIndex, well, lets see,\nlets think about this.\n\n209\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.485\nIn JavaScript I am able to generate\na number between 0 and 1 that is fairly\n\n210\n00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:31.942\nrandom, sudo random, lets just be\ncompletely clear, it's not truly random.\n\n211\n00:12:31.942 --> 00:12:39.140\nIf I type math.random,\nWell what does that give us?\n\n212\n00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.720\nLet's just make sure we\nknow what's going on there.\n\n213\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.940\nYou've got to spell console right and\nrandomIndex.\n\n214\n00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:52.413\nNotice, I'm not actually using word array,\nI'm just going to refresh the page and\n\n215\n00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:56.731\nhave this output a couple of times\nbecause it's being used here and\n\n216\n00:12:56.731 --> 00:13:01.074\nif I refresh, there's a 0.5 let\nme zoom in on that a little bit.\n\n217\n00:13:01.074 --> 00:13:06.847\nSo 0.5 and some other stuff,\nif I refresh again, 0.53, 0.08,\n\n218\n00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:13.700\nso it's a number, including 0,\nI can get 0, up to 1, but not including 1.\n\n219\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.360\nWell that doesn't help us right?\n\n220\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:23.832\n0, 1, 2, 3 I actually need between 0 and\n3, with three included,\n\n221\n00:13:23.832 --> 00:13:28.489\nor I could think about it as 0 and\n4, 4 not included.\n\n222\n00:13:28.489 --> 00:13:33.300\nAnd if 4 is not included, that kind of\nsets the same interval as math.random.\n\n223\n00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.878\nSo it's almost if I could stretch\nthat math.random across 0 to 4,\n\n224\n00:13:38.878 --> 00:13:42.736\nthen I would have maybe\na better number to go by.\n\n225\n00:13:42.736 --> 00:13:44.860\nWell I know that word array,\n\n226\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.830\nthere's like a property about arrays\nthat may give me what I need.\n\n227\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.406\nLength would actually give me 4 here, so\n\n228\n00:13:55.406 --> 00:14:00.628\nI wonder if I say times\nwordArray.length would that work?\n\n229\n00:14:02.046 --> 00:14:07.807\nSo if we refresh there's 3.86, 0.62,\n\n230\n00:14:07.807 --> 00:14:12.309\n3.8, 2.3, 3.3, 3.1.\n\n231\n00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:17.709\nOkay, well I'm getting\nnumbers between 0 and\n\n232\n00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:21.626\n4 but indexes are whole numbers.\n\n233\n00:14:21.626 --> 00:14:25.760\nI actually need just the thing\nbefore the decimal, all right?\n\n234\n00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.210\nSo if I refresh I need\njust the 1 not the 1.5216,\n\n235\n00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.945\nthe 3, not the 3.05.\n\n236\n00:14:33.945 --> 00:14:36.753\nI need 0 in this case, how do I get that?\n\n237\n00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:41.477\nWell I really don't know, now would be\na good time to dive into the documentation\n\n238\n00:14:41.477 --> 00:14:45.644\nfor some other math functions that\nmight be available in JavaScript and\n\n239\n00:14:45.644 --> 00:14:49.550\nthis is a common occurrence when\nI'm building web applications.\n\n240\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:54.060\nI wanna say JavaScript math MDM.\n\n241\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.201\nIf you can figure out the appropriate\nincantation to speak into,\n\n242\n00:14:57.201 --> 00:15:01.960\nyour favorite search engine, mine I just\ntypically use Google cuz I'm in Chrome.\n\n243\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.157\nThen you'll find fairly quickly\nthe information that you need.\n\n244\n00:15:06.157 --> 00:15:10.772\nBut if I scroll down through here,\nhere's some functions that are available\n\n245\n00:15:10.772 --> 00:15:15.700\ninside of math., it's a module,\na top-level kind of name space.\n\n246\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.388\nI don't think we need any sine,\ncosine, tangent, so cube root,\n\n247\n00:15:20.388 --> 00:15:25.694\nno ceiling returns the smallest integer\ngreater than or equal to a number.\n\n248\n00:15:25.694 --> 00:15:29.190\nWe're getting close that would actually,\nkind of, round up, right?\n\n249\n00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.430\nI would instead of at 3.05 I would get 4.\n\n250\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:37.383\nI want the opposite of that,\nso, I keep looking exponent,\n\n251\n00:15:37.383 --> 00:15:42.652\nno floor returns the large integer\nof less or equal to a number.\n\n252\n00:15:42.652 --> 00:15:43.980\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like the opposite.\n\n253\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.493\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like the opposite of floor,\nexcuse me, ceiling.\n\n254\n00:15:46.493 --> 00:15:47.398\n&gt;&gt; Of ceiling, yeah.\n\n255\n00:15:47.398 --> 00:15:49.219\n&gt;&gt; Ceiling, floor, okay.\n\n256\n00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:53.811\nSo if I take this expression and\nI say map.floor, and\n\n257\n00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:59.728\nI wrap all that in map.floor I wonder\nif I am going to get a random index\n\n258\n00:15:59.728 --> 00:16:06.290\nthat would give me some number\nbetween zero, one, two, and three.\n\n259\n00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.090\nWell, there is only one way to find out.\n\n260\n00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.430\nZero, three, two, zero,\ntwo, two, three, zero.\n\n261\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.880\nSo I am now getting an appropriate index.\n\n262\n00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.040\nI just refreshed like 35 times.\n\n263\n00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.550\nI was getting pretty crazy on that.\n\n264\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.553\nSo just in case you blinked,\nyou missed about 30 of them.\n\n265\n00:16:25.553 --> 00:16:28.050\nSo [COUGH] I'm getting whole numbers now.\n\n266\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.660\nNow I can use that to\nselect a random word.\n\n267\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:36.600\nOkay, let's see if I in fact\nam selecting a random word.\n\n268\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.471\nSo const randomWord,\nand this randomWord and\n\n269\n00:16:40.471 --> 00:16:46.240\nthis randomWord are different because\nthis is inside of a function.\n\n270\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.652\nSo it is scoped to the function.\n\n271\n00:16:47.652 --> 00:16:52.348\nI am doubly making sure that it is scoped\nto the function cuz I'm using const, and\n\n272\n00:16:52.348 --> 00:16:53.810\nconst is blocked scope.\n\n273\n00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.910\nSo between curly braces, it does not\nexist outside of those curly braces.\n\n274\n00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.020\nSo I'm gonna say wordArray.\n\n275\n00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.900\nAnd then randomIndex.\n\n276\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.484\nSo there's our randomIndex, and,\nor excuse me, our randomWord, and\n\n277\n00:17:08.484 --> 00:17:11.870\nlet's see, a bunch of periods in there.\n\n278\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:15.110\nLet's see what this randomWord is.\n\n279\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:20.710\nSo if I refresh, there's carrot, exist,\ncarrot, acres, carrot, carrot, mission.\n\n280\n00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:25.810\nIt's not perfect, but why would that\nbe giving me carrot more often?\n\n281\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.680\nRemember, I'm just getting a distribution.\n\n282\n00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.430\nWith a word list that is four in length,\nI'm bound to get the same word over and\n\n283\n00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.920\nover and over again.\n\n284\n00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.130\nSo as a thought process, how could I\nmake this a more robust application?\n\n285\n00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.230\n&gt;&gt; Could you sell it too?\n\n286\n00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.120\nIf you've already had carrots,\ndon't use that anywhere.\n\n287\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.790\nKinda like set it off to the side\n&gt;&gt; You're crazy, Daniel.\n\n288\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.690\nYou're crazy.\n\n289\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.335\nDaniel is, he's in my brain.\n\n290\n00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:50.857\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's in my brain, and\n\n291\n00:17:50.857 --> 00:17:52.614\nit kinda scares me.\n\n292\n00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:53.560\nKinda scares me.\n\n293\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.928\nThat is absolutely one way-\n&gt;&gt; By the way, you need milk\n\n294\n00:17:55.928 --> 00:17:57.379\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:17:57.379 --> 00:17:58.911\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right, that's right.\n\n296\n00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:02.136\nI was like I do need milk.\n\n297\n00:18:02.136 --> 00:18:06.270\nSo I couldn't look in,\nhey I don't want to do this if\n\n298\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.170\nthe next word that I'm getting\nis the old word that I just had.\n\n299\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.402\nOr another simple way is,\nI could just make that word list giant.\n\n300\n00:18:14.402 --> 00:18:18.280\nRight, and if I make the word list giant\nthen the individual probabilities of\n\n301\n00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.960\nchoosing a word one after the other,\nof the same word, goes down significantly.\n\n302\n00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.700\nSo since we're using four, for\n\n303\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.750\nnow we're gonna leave it that way, it'll\nmake testing easier, more predictable.\n\n304\n00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.170\nBut that is something we need to\nkeep in mind as we further develop\n\n305\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:32.910\nthis application.\n\n306\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:39.595\nSo if I look back inside my\neditor here and randomWord,\n\n307\n00:18:39.595 --> 00:18:44.140\nrandomIndex, but this function's\nnot actually giving me a value out.\n\n308\n00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.845\nI need to return randomWord.\n\n309\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.640\nAnd now whatever was here\n\n310\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.378\nhas been assigned to this variable\nthat's in more of a global scope, right?\n\n311\n00:18:55.378 --> 00:18:58.280\nSo, good deal.\n\n312\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.960\nNow, what do we wanna do?\n\n313\n00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.000\nWell, I have this string,\nbut it would almost be nice.\n\n314\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.570\nI know for a fact, it would be nice\nif these were individual letters,\n\n315\n00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.550\nand I had some property for that letter of\nwhether it should be hidden or not, right?\n\n316\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.150\nWhether I have gotten it correct or not.\n\n317\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.720\nSo, I'm gonna use a word called state.\n\n318\n00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.490\nNow, state is, well,\n\n319\n00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.880\nit's kinda like where's your\napplication at in this point in time?\n\n320\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.270\nSo, I'm gonna take randomWord,\nI'm gonna split it.\n\n321\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.680\nAnd after I split it, I'm going to\nmap over those individual elements.\n\n322\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.180\nSo when I split, I'm gonna get A,\nC, R, E, S as an array.\n\n323\n00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:54.630\nAnd for each letter,\nI want to return an object.\n\n324\n00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.342\nAnd what is the object going to give me?\n\n325\n00:19:56.342 --> 00:20:02.528\nIt's going to give me a hidden property\nthat I'm going to say is true.\n\n326\n00:20:02.528 --> 00:20:09.150\nAnd the letter, that is going to\nbe corresponding to the letter.\n\n327\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.463\nNow [SOUND] that was some\ncraziness right there.\n\n328\n00:20:12.463 --> 00:20:14.793\nLet's actually take a look\nat what is held in state.\n\n329\n00:20:14.793 --> 00:20:19.450\nAnd we're actually gonna clean this up\na little bit using some new ES6 features.\n\n330\n00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.836\nBut I think we'll make it\na little more readable.\n\n331\n00:20:21.836 --> 00:20:28.530\nSo console.log, and state.\n\n332\n00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:34.298\nAnd if we refresh,\nwe now have an array of objects where A,\n\n333\n00:20:34.298 --> 00:20:41.850\nC, R E but notice they should all\nbe hidden on page load, right?\n\n334\n00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.680\nYou haven't guessed anything,\nthere's no way that I can say yeah,\n\n335\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.930\nyou have this letter,\nit should be revealed.\n\n336\n00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.450\nSo we're gonna say they're\nall hidden by default.\n\n337\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.625\nLet's as we're doing this, this is one of\nthose times where I'm not gonna wait to\n\n338\n00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:56.660\nre-factor this little bit\nafter I know it works.\n\n339\n00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.580\nI want to clean this up a little bit.\n\n340\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.848\nSo instead of split,\nI wanna take this random word and\n\n341\n00:21:03.848 --> 00:21:10.720\nuse the spread operator, And here we go.\n\n342\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.290\nAnd now that I just wanna\nreturn hidden true and\n\n343\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.650\nletter, I can provide some shorthand here,\nand just remove letter,\n\n344\n00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.120\nso letter will actually correspond\nto the value in letter.\n\n345\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.680\nIt will do that in naming for me.\n\n346\n00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.290\nAnd finally,\nif I wanna return this object,\n\n347\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:33.710\nif I'm not mistaken,\nI should be able to get rid of this here.\n\n348\n00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:39.960\nAnd remove this here.\n\n349\n00:21:45.068 --> 00:21:47.640\nWhoa, and add a parentheses.\n\n350\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.731\nAnd if I add parentheses, notice I\nhave another set of parentheses here?\n\n351\n00:21:53.731 --> 00:21:55.975\nI should be able to\nreturn this as an object.\n\n352\n00:21:55.975 --> 00:22:02.454\n[SOUND] And clean this up a little more.\n\n353\n00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:03.720\nSo there we go.\n\n354\n00:22:06.604 --> 00:22:09.010\nLet's see if that worked for us.\n\n355\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.789\nI think it's a little, little neater,\nlittle easier to read.\n\n356\n00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:15.640\nAnd in fact, it does clean that up.\n\n357\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.710\nYou can still break this to the next line.\n\n358\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.523\nAnd it will operate on\nthis spread out array.\n\n359\n00:22:21.523 --> 00:22:25.560\nAnd so I am taking the randomWord, and\ngenerating an object for each letter\n\n360\n00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.480\nwithin it that will have the letter\nvalue and whether it is hidden or not.\n\n361\n00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.850\nAnd we are going to use this for\ndecision making later on, so\n\n362\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.500\nI have kind of done some of that\nthought process up front, alright?\n\n363\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.570\nI need to know whether it's hidden or not.\n\n364\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.470\nAnd I need to know what letter it is.\n\n365\n00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.670\nSo for each letter, I need to\nhave a combination of properties.\n\n366\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.880\nI need to have an object, right?\n\n367\n00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.950\nA value for hidden or not,\nand the actual letter itself.\n\n368\n00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.610\nSo there's our initial state.\n\n369\n00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.140\nThis state will change depending\non what the random word is.\n\n370\n00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.970\nWell that's good to know.\n\n371\n00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:03.540\nWell, after we've done this initial setup,\nwhat else do we need to do?\n\n372\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.680\nThis is our data and variables.\n\n373\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.680\nSo let's remind ourselves of what this is.\n\n374\n00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.330\nData and variables.\n\n375\n00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.074\nNext, I need to cache the DOM.\n\n376\n00:23:16.074 --> 00:23:18.970\nGotta spell cache right.\n\n377\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.240\nAnd what am I gonna have in the DOM?\n\n378\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.075\nWell I need the app, and\n\n379\n00:23:25.075 --> 00:23:30.227\nthat's document.querySelector.\n\n380\n00:23:30.227 --> 00:23:33.490\nAnd this is in preparation for,\n\n381\n00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:38.085\nI always need to select just\nthe part I'm interested in.\n\n382\n00:23:38.085 --> 00:23:43.960\nCuz it's good to know just this individual\npiece is our entire application,\n\n383\n00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.080\nand that way I get that\nmodularity that I'm looking for.\n\n384\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.320\nBut we may find some difficulties\nwith that, we'll see.\n\n385\n00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.277\nAnd then I need the guessesOutput.\n\n386\n00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.618\nAnd that is within the app.\n\n387\n00:23:58.618 --> 00:24:02.734\nLook for Is it guesses?\n\n388\n00:24:02.734 --> 00:24:04.416\nI can't remember.\n\n389\n00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:07.230\nIf I can't remember,\nI'll just go back and look.\n\n390\n00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.250\nIt is.\n\n391\n00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:16.340\nAnd then I will use some\nmagic to quickly get those.\n\n392\n00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.660\nSo I now have the DOM cache, and\nlet's add a little bit of space down here,\n\n393\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.460\nso I can not have that\nweird overscroll stuff.\n\n394\n00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.270\nSo now I have the app, the guesses output,\n\n395\n00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.725\nthe letters output,\nnow I need to add EventListeners.\n\n396\n00:24:33.725 --> 00:24:38.027\nAnd here's where it gets weird.\n\n397\n00:24:38.027 --> 00:24:41.490\nWhat am I gonna listen to?\n\n398\n00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:43.080\nWhat's actually gonna\nbe doing the listening?\n\n399\n00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.150\nWhat events am I gonna be listening to?\n\n400\n00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.140\nAnd typically I would have a button here.\n\n401\n00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.745\nI would listen for a click or\ndouble-click or a hover over.\n\n402\n00:24:51.745 --> 00:24:55.832\nWell, I wanna listen to KeyboardEvents and\n\n403\n00:24:55.832 --> 00:25:01.000\nI know those have a KeyDown,\na KeyPress, a KeyUp.\n\n404\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.420\nI can listen to a bunch\nof KeyboardEvents and\n\n405\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.040\nlet's go take a look of\nwhere I could find those.\n\n406\n00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.660\nIf I don't remember.\n\n407\n00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.710\nSo if I go events javascript mdn\n\n408\n00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.940\nand event reference, and what are some\nevents that I can listen for?\n\n409\n00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:25.550\nOkay, here's transition events,\nforum events, view events.\n\n410\n00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.848\nHere we go, KeyboardEvents.\n\n411\n00:25:27.848 --> 00:25:32.050\nKeyDown, KeyPress, KeyUp.\n\n412\n00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.595\nWhat is the difference between these?\n\n413\n00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:36.200\nLet's zoom in just a little bit.\n\n414\n00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.500\nKeyDown, any key is pressed.\n\n415\n00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:44.810\nKeyPress, any key except Shift, Function,\nCaps Lock, is in pressed position.\n\n416\n00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.250\nSo if I hold down a key,\nthis will actually rapid fire, right?\n\n417\n00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:53.340\nSo if I was building kind of\nan RPG game or something.\n\n418\n00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.470\nIf I needed rapid fire,\nthese would be different events.\n\n419\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:02.150\nBut notice this is except\nShift Function key in Caps Locks and\n\n420\n00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.650\nthen KeyUp is the actual release state.\n\n421\n00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:09.610\nSo a full what we think of as a KeyPress\nis actually a down and up motion.\n\n422\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:11.550\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n423\n00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.300\nKeyDown is down.\n\n424\n00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.148\nKeyUp is up.\n\n425\n00:26:15.148 --> 00:26:18.530\nAnd then KeyPress is, you can hold it\ndown and it will continue to fire.\n\n426\n00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.890\nSo I'm gonna listen for KeyDown.\n\n427\n00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.895\nAnd let's see how these events work out.\n\n428\n00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.320\nSo I think app is probably the best way.\n\n429\n00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.270\nWhat do you think, Daniel?\n\n430\n00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:33.150\nYou think app is the best thing\nto listen to the KeyPress events.\n\n431\n00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.967\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with no.\n\n432\n00:26:34.967 --> 00:26:36.090\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n433\n00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.360\nWe'll see if Daniel's right.\n\n434\n00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.770\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n435\n00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:39.560\n&gt;&gt; That's funny.\n\n436\n00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.717\nMe either.\n\n437\n00:26:40.717 --> 00:26:42.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're going to find out, right?\n\n438\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're going to find out and\n\n439\n00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.400\npart of this is sometimes you're\njust taking a guess, right?\n\n440\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.639\n&gt;&gt; Throwing it at the wall and\nsee what sticks?\n\n441\n00:26:48.639 --> 00:26:50.360\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that one works.\n\n442\n00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.630\nSo I wanna look at KeyPress,\nactually KeyDown.\n\n443\n00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:59.771\nRight, I don't wanna accidentally\nguess a bunch of times [SOUND] I lost.\n\n444\n00:26:59.771 --> 00:27:05.140\nSo KeyDown and what are we gonna do,\nwe're actually gonna guess.\n\n445\n00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:09.930\nRight now, this function doesn't exist and\nwould break.\n\n446\n00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.410\nBut I'm going to accept\nthe event as an argument.\n\n447\n00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.970\nWe don't necessarily always need this.\n\n448\n00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.420\nAnd maybe I'll just be more transparent.\n\n449\n00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:25.270\nIt is the event object and we're just\ngonna console.log the event object.\n\n450\n00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:33.379\nAnd if we refresh, and\nyou actually have to click over here.\n\n451\n00:27:33.379 --> 00:27:40.720\nWell, hm, I'm pressing keys,\nbut it's not firing.\n\n452\n00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.363\nWhy is it?\n\n453\n00:27:41.363 --> 00:27:44.700\nHm, that's odd.\n\n454\n00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.300\nWell, maybe the app is not the best\nthing to listen to the event.\n\n455\n00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.510\nSo how can we fix that?\n\n456\n00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.090\nThe window is global everywhere.\n\n457\n00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.420\nIt can listen to all kinds of things.\n\n458\n00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:03.970\nSo I can now listen everywhere.\n\n459\n00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.510\nWhat does this mean, though?\n\n460\n00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.180\nIn some previous projects, we've been\nable to duplicate this all over the page.\n\n461\n00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:14.670\nThis limits us a little bit,\ncuz we have to use the Window to listen.\n\n462\n00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.291\nWe're limited to a single instance\nof this game on the page.\n\n463\n00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:23.500\nAnd that's because the window would be\nlistening for everything over and over and\n\n464\n00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.200\nover again.\n\n465\n00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.240\nBut that does not preclude us from\nthat refactor, making it nice and\n\n466\n00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.220\ntidy and readable.\n\n467\n00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.450\nSo if we ever want to go add features,\nor maybe we add an ability to, for\n\n468\n00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:39.560\nanother kind of overall object to listen,\nand that can be part of our setup.\n\n469\n00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.170\nSo if we look, I'm gonna refresh\njust to clean this up a little bit.\n\n470\n00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.297\nI hit the key a,\n\n471\n00:28:44.297 --> 00:28:48.868\nand notice this KeyboardEvent\ngives me all kinds of information.\n\n472\n00:28:48.868 --> 00:28:50.770\nWas the Alt key held?\n\n473\n00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.180\nNo.\n\n474\n00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.960\nWhat is the code key a?\n\n475\n00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.750\nWhat is the key a?\n\n476\n00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.510\nWhat is the keyCode 65.\n\n477\n00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:03.570\nNow today it's probably easier\njust to compare this with,\n\n478\n00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.980\nwell, what we have in the letters array,\nin the state.\n\n479\n00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.620\nSo how are we gonna do this when we guess?\n\n480\n00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.743\nLet's think through this.\n\n481\n00:29:13.743 --> 00:29:18.910\nHm, I think I'm just going\nto leave that blank.\n\n482\n00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.099\nLet's figure out the other part.\n\n483\n00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:22.400\nWe'll just come back to that.\n\n484\n00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.685\nI know, I like drama, Daniel.\n\n485\n00:29:23.685 --> 00:29:24.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like drama.\n\n486\n00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.720\nYou should have seen it.\n\n487\n00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.368\nAnd Daniel was like, what, what?\n\n488\n00:29:28.368 --> 00:29:29.703\nSo leave me hanging, bro.\n\n489\n00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:30.800\nNo.\n\n490\n00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.680\nSo we had our EventListeners.\n\n491\n00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.180\nAnd then we need that first render, right?\n\n492\n00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.770\nWhat are we going to render to the page?\n\n493\n00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.890\nAnd render doesn't exist.\n\n494\n00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:46.490\nSo we should make that, A function.\n\n495\n00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:47.839\nNow what is render gonna do?\n\n496\n00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:54.020\nWell, first off, every time it renders,\nit's going to clear the letter's output.\n\n497\n00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.658\nAnd that's because part of an animation,\nwhat they're actually doing when they\n\n498\n00:29:57.658 --> 00:30:01.471\nanimate frames, is they clear and repaint,\nclear and repaint, clear and repaint.\n\n499\n00:30:01.471 --> 00:30:04.926\nAnd if you can do that fast enough,\nyour eyes can't perceive that that's\n\n500\n00:30:04.926 --> 00:30:08.090\nhappening and it looks like,\nit just changed.\n\n501\n00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.589\nOr you have this, if there's something\nmoving across the screen like a flip book,\n\n502\n00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.340\nthen it's persistence of vision,\nI think it's called, and\n\n503\n00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.280\nyour eye will say, hey, that's moving.\n\n504\n00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.560\nAnd that's how you get tricked\ninto thinking things are animated.\n\n505\n00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.229\nA bunch of still images,\nplayed really fast in front of you.\n\n506\n00:30:24.229 --> 00:30:26.600\nSo what is render going to do?\n\n507\n00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.390\nIt's going to take the letters output and\nthe interHTML.\n\n508\n00:30:33.494 --> 00:30:35.810\nLet's just clear it out.\n\n509\n00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.820\nAnd then we want to make it again.\n\n510\n00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.070\nAnd how is that going to work?\n\n511\n00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:45.890\nSo for the state, I'm going to\nrun through each of the elements.\n\n512\n00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:53.010\nAnd for each piece of state,\nI'm using those fat arrow functions\n\n513\n00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:58.620\njust because I think they're nice and\nthey work in this context.\n\n514\n00:31:00.061 --> 00:31:02.310\nThis is where it gets a little heady.\n\n515\n00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.914\nI wanna create a box, and what is the box?\n\n516\n00:31:04.914 --> 00:31:10.420\nI'm gonna use a new function that\nwe haven't seen in a little while.\n\n517\n00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.010\nAnd it is just going to create a div.\n\n518\n00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.880\nThat div is going to be a holder for\nan individual piece of state.\n\n519\n00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.820\nWhat is the piece of state?\n\n520\n00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.630\nIt's a letter with whether it\nshould be displayed or not.\n\n521\n00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:29.950\nWithin that box I'm going to say\nbox.classlist.add the class of box.\n\n522\n00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.425\nThat is not how you spell box.\n\n523\n00:31:32.425 --> 00:31:34.917\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Box.\n\n524\n00:31:34.917 --> 00:31:40.200\nAnd then I'm going to create a text node.\n\n525\n00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.690\nBut I'm not gonna use the text node.\n\n526\n00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.580\nI'm actually gonna create another\ndiv that stays inside of this div.\n\n527\n00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.229\nSo I want the box to show,\nbecause that's gonna be like hey,\n\n528\n00:31:48.229 --> 00:31:50.317\nthere's actually a letter here.\n\n529\n00:31:50.317 --> 00:31:56.409\nBut inside of that I want it to be\nhidden when someone hasn't guessed that.\n\n530\n00:31:56.409 --> 00:32:03.384\nSo I'm gonna create another div,\nMaybe That goes inside of there.\n\n531\n00:32:03.384 --> 00:32:04.753\nAnd notice I'm doing this dynamically.\n\n532\n00:32:04.753 --> 00:32:11.268\nI don't have any markup in my\nHTML that would produce this.\n\n533\n00:32:11.268 --> 00:32:16.819\nAnd the text is gonna have a textContent,\n\n534\n00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:20.540\nOf piece.letter.\n\n535\n00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:24.353\nAnd that comes from the fact that,\nwithin our state,\n\n536\n00:32:24.353 --> 00:32:27.841\nwe said letter corresponds\nto the value letter.\n\n537\n00:32:27.841 --> 00:32:32.260\nRight, so the letter property of this\nobject is the actual letter for the word.\n\n538\n00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.409\nAnd let's see here,\n\n539\n00:32:37.409 --> 00:32:43.119\nI need to also text.style.display.\n\n540\n00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:47.280\nAnd I wanna add a new operator in here,\nthis is called the ternary operator.\n\n541\n00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.068\nIt's nice for\nlittle quick conditional assignments.\n\n542\n00:32:51.068 --> 00:32:55.766\nAnd I'm gonna ask the question,\nis the piece supposed to be hidden,\n\n543\n00:32:55.766 --> 00:32:56.900\nquestion mark?\n\n544\n00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:00.154\nIf it is, what should I do?\n\n545\n00:33:02.456 --> 00:33:05.870\nI wanna assign the value\nof none to display.\n\n546\n00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:10.860\nIf it's not,\nthen I'm gonna say inline-block, okay?\n\n547\n00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:20.000\nSo I'm asking a question,\nif the question is true, then none.\n\n548\n00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.660\nSo if it is hidden, otherwise, display.\n\n549\n00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.590\nNow this is some weird syntax,\n\n550\n00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:29.161\nI will actually show this with\nan if else in just a moment.\n\n551\n00:33:29.161 --> 00:33:33.677\nBut I wanted to show you that these quick\nlittle assignments that just have a simple\n\n552\n00:33:33.677 --> 00:33:37.230\ncondition can definitely be\nuseful with the ternary operator.\n\n553\n00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.160\nAnd then, finally, what do I wanna do?\n\n554\n00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.210\nbox.append, I wanna put\nthe text div inside of the box.\n\n555\n00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:50.510\nAnd lettersOutput,\nI want to append this as a child.\n\n556\n00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.400\nSo for the lettersOutput portion,\nI want each of the boxes in there.\n\n557\n00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:02.710\nAnd finally, outside of that,\nguessesOutput.\n\n558\n00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.180\nI want the text content to be, and\n\n559\n00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:12.680\nI wanna use back ticks here just to\nhelp with some basic templating.\n\n560\n00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:18.147\nAnd I'm gonna say guesses:,\n\n561\n00:34:18.147 --> 00:34:22.145\nand then guessCount.\n\n562\n00:34:22.145 --> 00:34:26.946\nSo whatever the guessCount\nis at this render stage\n\n563\n00:34:26.946 --> 00:34:31.900\nwill actually be replaced\nthere of MAX_GUESSES.\n\n564\n00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.040\nSo I'll just update it as\nplain text within that.\n\n565\n00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.670\nCould we wrap that in a div or\nstyle it otherwise?\n\n566\n00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.314\nSure, but for now we're just\ngonna have some basic output.\n\n567\n00:34:41.314 --> 00:34:42.549\nLet's go see how that looks.\n\n568\n00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.660\nAnd it doesn't look like it worked.\n\n569\n00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.524\nHm, why didn't it work?\n\n570\n00:34:48.524 --> 00:34:49.647\nLet's go make sure.\n\n571\n00:34:51.344 --> 00:34:54.160\nWell, in fact, it did work.\n\n572\n00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:59.620\nBut all of those letters are hidden and\nthis containing box\n\n573\n00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:04.210\ndoesn't have any styling yet so\nthey all stack on top of each other.\n\n574\n00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.840\nSo we will have to add\na little bit of styling to\n\n575\n00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.670\nhelp with the development process.\n\n576\n00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:14.140\nAnd this could be your final styling or\nmaybe it's just something you need for\n\n577\n00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.495\nnow to help visualize what's going on.\n\n578\n00:35:16.495 --> 00:35:20.187\nBut Daniel, I think that might be a little\nlonger of an undertaking than we currently\n\n579\n00:35:20.187 --> 00:35:20.878\nhave time for.\n\n580\n00:35:20.878 --> 00:35:23.543\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we've [LAUGH] gone a little\novertime on this episode, but\n\n581\n00:35:23.543 --> 00:35:25.448\nwe had to find a good stopping spot for\nthat.\n\n582\n00:35:25.448 --> 00:35:29.187\nCuz this is, like we said,\nit seems simple when you start off.\n\n583\n00:35:29.187 --> 00:35:31.811\nBut once you dive into this\nthing you're going, man,\n\n584\n00:35:31.811 --> 00:35:35.750\nthere's a lot of stuff we gotta do to\njust make this little hangman game.\n\n585\n00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.010\nSo, that being said, we're gonna\nhave to do ourselves a part two.\n\n586\n00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.640\nHopefully you guys are on the edge of\nyour seat going, I have got to see that.\n\n587\n00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.840\nI've gotta see the culmination,\nall the cool stuff that Justin's gonna do\n\n588\n00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.040\ninside of this app to make it work and\nlook correct.\n\n589\n00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.240\nAnd then you'll learn things on top of\nthat so that you can do that as well.\n\n590\n00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.710\nJustin, so\nit looks like we're gonna do that,\n\n591\n00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.230\nwe'll look forward to seeing you there.\n\n592\n00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.840\nHopefully we'll see our\naudience members there as well.\n\n593\n00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.280\nBut as for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n594\n00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.160\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n595\n00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.110\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n596\n00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.111\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see

00:00:16.581\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:18.666\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:23.360\nin today's episode we are back with more\non our intro to web development series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.590\nAnd coming back with a part two\non building our hangman game\n\n10\n00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.260\nis our good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n11\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.870\nJustin, welcome back, man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.590\n&gt;&gt; It's going well,\nhow are you today, Dan?\n\n13\n00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.920\n&gt;&gt; I am great, thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.720\n&gt;&gt; I like-\n&gt;&gt; Ready for more hangman.\n\n15\n00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, all right,\nI love to hear great.\n\n16\n00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.370\nYeah, we left off after some, whew,\n\n17\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.580\nman, I was, my brain hurt a little\nbit after explaining this.\n\n18\n00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.064\nSo if you haven't seen episode one,\ndefinitely go check it out cuz-\n\n19\n00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:48.093\n&gt;&gt; It gave me the vapors.\n\n20\n00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:50.391\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was like [SOUND].\n\n21\n00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:53.589\nSo definitely go check that out because,\nwell,\n\n22\n00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.450\nthere's some crucial thought processes\nthat I hope I conveyed fairly well to you.\n\n23\n00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.060\nAnd it's not, I mean,\nI know the language fairly well.\n\n24\n00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.840\nI've done this for a while.\n\n25\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.490\nDo keep in mind it's not always gonna\nbe as quick and fast as you've seen.\n\n26\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.230\nBut I tried to emulate, like I'm looking\nup information on the documentation.\n\n27\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.250\nI'm trying to reason through it.\n\n28\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.630\nI'm taking it piece by piece, right?\n\n29\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.800\nI'm taking those small\nbites instead of going,\n\n30\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.480\nI'm gonna roll this pizza up and\nshove it in my mouth, right?\n\n31\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.530\nI'm eating a piece at a time.\n\n32\n00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.710\nSo we started there, and we left off\nafter finishing the render function.\n\n33\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.240\nAnd the render function, well,\nit was being a little weird, right?\n\n34\n00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.910\nSo maybe, maybe now is a good time to,\n\n35\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.253\nwe should probably gonna\ndo a little bit of CSS.\n\n36\n00:01:36.253 --> 00:01:39.650\nBecause it's gonna make our\ndevelopment process a little easier.\n\n37\n00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.461\nSo lets go ahead and hop back in here.\n\n38\n00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:45.170\nI do have a little bit of CSS for\nus, it's not the most beautiful.\n\n39\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.309\nIt is more about trying to\nreason through what's going on.\n\n40\n00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.380\nAnd I'm actually gonna change\nthe background color to beige.\n\n41\n00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.453\nWe're in our main.css here.\n\n42\n00:01:55.453 --> 00:01:58.841\nWe're doing a little bit of styling\nbecause as we saw last time,\n\n43\n00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:02.780\njust to refresh,\nthe background color will be different.\n\n44\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.600\nThis does output the letters\nas we anticipate, but\n\n45\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.160\nthey're all stacked on top of each other.\n\n46\n00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.200\nAnd well, that's because this outside box\ndoesn't have any dimension divs by default\n\n47\n00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.640\nas 0 width, 0 height.\n\n48\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.750\nIf I'm not mistaken we should,\nwell, we gotta keep me honest.\n\n49\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.150\nSometimes I say things, and I'm like,\nwell, I don't know if that's quite true.\n\n50\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.298\nAnd in this context, I do have a width,\nbut I do not have a heighth.\n\n51\n00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:33.460\nSo they kinda squish on top of each other,\nand we don't want that.\n\n52\n00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.430\nWe want to be able to see\nthe individual letters.\n\n53\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.820\nSo let's go fix that, and before I fix\nthat, let me drag this back down here.\n\n54\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.450\nThere we go, so let's fix that.\n\n55\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.862\nWe know that the guesses portion\nof this application needs,\n\n56\n00:02:48.862 --> 00:02:50.910\nwell, it needs a little bit of styling.\n\n57\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.440\nI'm gonna say the width is\n100% of what are view port is.\n\n58\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.529\nRight, I have it 100%.\n\n59\n00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:01.770\nAnd the display,\nI'm using that flexbox thing again.\n\n60\n00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.157\nIf you don't have a newer browser,\nyour mileage may vary.\n\n61\n00:03:05.157 --> 00:03:07.182\nThis may not work out for you.\n\n62\n00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:12.440\nBut I do like flexbox because it makes,\nso many things so much easier.\n\n63\n00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.624\nAnd I wanna create a border\nthat is solid red.\n\n64\n00:03:15.624 --> 00:03:20.940\nAnd this is more for me to see the\nparticular areas that I'm developing in.\n\n65\n00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.827\nI have the guesses output, and\nthen I have the actual letters output.\n\n66\n00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:26.980\nAnd I wanna separate those with a border.\n\n67\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.070\nSo I'm making those\nkind of in your face so\n\n68\n00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.980\nwe can see that\nthe differences between those.\n\n69\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.640\nAnd then I'm gonna justify\nthe content to the center.\n\n70\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.760\nAnd that should be it for guesses.\n\n71\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.450\nNow what about the letters output?\n\n72\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.500\nWell, let's see here,\ngot .letters, width: 100%,\n\n73\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.500\nalso the full width of the container.\n\n74\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.170\nAnd the height is going to be,\nwell, I wanted 300 pixels, but\n\n75\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.780\nlet's assume 16 pixel size.\n\n76\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.280\nWhat is 300 divided by 16?\n\n77\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.730\nEh, it's close to 15, 16,\nsomewhere around there?\n\n78\n00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.629\nWell, actually it's about 18, I think.\n\n79\n00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.520\nSo we're gonna guess,\nit doesn't have to be exact.\n\n80\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.415\nSo I want the height to be 18em,\n\n81\n00:04:10.415 --> 00:04:13.687\nwhich is based on the default\npixel size of your browser.\n\n82\n00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:16.352\nAnd then that way, if your browser\nchanges its default pixel size,\n\n83\n00:04:16.352 --> 00:04:18.670\nthat will scale appropriately.\n\n84\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.922\nAnd then the border for this one is\ngoing to be 3px, solid and green.\n\n85\n00:04:24.922 --> 00:04:28.180\nWhew, these are going\nto work well together.\n\n86\n00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.776\nAnd I also want this to\nbe a flexbox container.\n\n87\n00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:38.856\nAnd I'm gonna align the items\nin this one to the center and\n\n88\n00:04:38.856 --> 00:04:42.520\njustify the content to the center also.\n\n89\n00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.810\nNow comes the fun part.\n\n90\n00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.630\nWe created these elements\nthat have a class of box.\n\n91\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.230\nWhat I want is a defined kind of box\nshape that inside I can display or\n\n92\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.537\nshut off whatever's inside of those.\n\n93\n00:04:55.537 --> 00:04:57.073\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n94\n00:04:57.073 --> 00:05:01.764\nI'm gonna create this box element,\nand let's see here, there we go.\n\n95\n00:05:01.764 --> 00:05:05.420\nWe got some way to keep that\nover-scroll from happening.\n\n96\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.932\nAnd I'm gonna have a width of 50px.\n\n97\n00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:14.258\nNow 50px is about 3ems, so\nwe should use those as sizes,\n\n98\n00:05:14.258 --> 00:05:17.680\nthose relative units, when we can.\n\n99\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.930\nNow if you're using pixels, and\nyou can reason about pixels, by all means.\n\n100\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.707\nWe're learning here, right?\n\n101\n00:05:21.707 --> 00:05:24.190\nIt's not a full deployment.\n\n102\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.220\nAnd then also I'm gonna have 3em height.\n\n103\n00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.969\nAnd my border is going to be\na 1px solid black border.\n\n104\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.980\nAnd I'm gonna have this\nas a flex container also.\n\n105\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.010\nAnd that's because I want to center\nthe letters inside of this box.\n\n106\n00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.027\nI don't want them to be in\nupper left-hand corner,\n\n107\n00:05:47.027 --> 00:05:49.300\nlower right-hand corner,\nany of those things.\n\n108\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.685\nSo I'm gonna make sure that things\nare centered appropriately.\n\n109\n00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:55.432\nAnd I wanna have a text-transform.\n\n110\n00:05:55.432 --> 00:06:00.281\nSo text-transform is interesting because,\nin CSS, I can force all\n\n111\n00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:05.223\nthe text to be capitalized, or\ntake up the full width, or lowercase.\n\n112\n00:06:05.223 --> 00:06:09.311\nI'm actually gonna say uppercase\nbecause whatever's inside of that,\n\n113\n00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:11.329\nI want it to be uppercase in nature.\n\n114\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.832\nAnd then align-items: center and\njustify-content: center.\n\n115\n00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:23.690\nAnd there we go, so\nlet's see what happens.\n\n116\n00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.300\nLet's see how that changes.\n\n117\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.300\nAnd now I actually have something that\nis starting to look a little bit like\n\n118\n00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.400\na game, right?\n\n119\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.200\nHow many letters do I have to guess now?\n\n120\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.740\nNow that I have the boxes,\nI can go one, two, three, four, five.\n\n121\n00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.300\nOkay, this is gonna make\nour development process\n\n122\n00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.570\na little bit easier to reason about.\n\n123\n00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.870\nThough it does look small on the screen,\nso I am gonna zoom in just a little bit.\n\n124\n00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.250\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait to see you\ncode Vanna White into this.\n\n125\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.341\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whoo, yeah, that maybe another whole\n\n126\n00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:56.491\nother series [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] 12 episodes long.\n\n127\n00:06:56.491 --> 00:06:59.186\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so let's take a look.\n\n128\n00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:00.300\nThere's our render.\n\n129\n00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.610\nBut now that our render's done, hm,\nwe need to get back and look at guess.\n\n130\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.196\nBecause guess is gonna kinda\ndetermine how this render changes.\n\n131\n00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:13.418\nWe're gonna call render after\nour guess has changed any state.\n\n132\n00:07:13.418 --> 00:07:17.780\nAnd remember, state is just,\nis it hidden or not and what letter is it?\n\n133\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.450\nBut guess is going to offer that\nbased on the event that has occurred,\n\n134\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.250\nthe keyboard event.\n\n135\n00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.280\nAnd so the first thing we need to do,\nwe actually need the event inside of this\n\n136\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.980\nguess function, event.key.\n\n137\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.250\nBut we should probably put\nthat in a variable and\n\n138\n00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.610\nnot just type random things here.\n\n139\n00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.397\nSo I'm gonna grab the key\nproperty from the event.\n\n140\n00:07:41.397 --> 00:07:45.040\nAnd I'm using this guess\nfunction as a keyboard event.\n\n141\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.269\nIf this was a click event, right,\nI hooked up guess to another event type,\n\n142\n00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.927\n[SOUND] this might not work quite well.\n\n143\n00:07:52.927 --> 00:07:57.536\nBut let's see, hm, what do I need to do?\n\n144\n00:07:57.536 --> 00:08:04.010\nWell, I need to run through every piece\nof state, each one of those letters And\n\n145\n00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:09.619\ndetermine does this key match\nthe letter that is stored right here?\n\n146\n00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:15.820\nIf it is, I want to change it from hidden,\ntrue to hidden and false.\n\n147\n00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.410\nI want to unhide it effectively.\n\n148\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:24.350\nSo, let's see here, state.forEach.\n\n149\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:29.692\nAnd for each piece of state,\nWhat do I want to do?\n\n150\n00:08:29.692 --> 00:08:32.014\nI'm a big fan of the arrow functions.\n\n151\n00:08:32.014 --> 00:08:37.049\nCan't do this with a normal function,\nbut I do like the arrow ones.\n\n152\n00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:41.143\nSo for each piece of state,\n\n153\n00:08:41.143 --> 00:08:46.309\nif piece.letter === the key.\n\n154\n00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:52.038\nI want the piece.hidden to be false.\n\n155\n00:08:53.515 --> 00:08:55.477\nThat's actually all I need to do.\n\n156\n00:08:55.477 --> 00:09:00.238\nRight at the end of guess,\nI want to re-render.\n\n157\n00:09:00.238 --> 00:09:02.529\nLet's see how this works out.\n\n158\n00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:07.243\nOkay, so if I refresh, ooh,\n\n159\n00:09:07.243 --> 00:09:11.210\nso maybe this is carrot.\n\n160\n00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.781\nAll right, so we have kind of\nour basic working version, but\n\n161\n00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:24.248\nas it stands, I can never lose,\never, ever, ever, ever, ever.\n\n162\n00:09:24.248 --> 00:09:25.828\nSo, well what do we need to do?\n\n163\n00:09:25.828 --> 00:09:31.509\nEvery time we guess before we render,\nmaybe,\n\n164\n00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:37.511\nWe should check to see if we've won or\nnot, right?\n\n165\n00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:38.420\nSo did I win?\n\n166\n00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:46.490\nAnd during the win process part of that\nis, how many guesses have you taken?\n\n167\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.571\nHow many guesses do you have left?\n\n168\n00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:50.061\nHave you gotten all the letters?\n\n169\n00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:51.524\nAre they all true?\n\n170\n00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:58.727\nSo I'm actually gonna say for\neach one, check for the win, okay?\n\n171\n00:10:01.132 --> 00:10:06.587\nNow, also I need to\nincrement guesses every\n\n172\n00:10:06.587 --> 00:10:11.900\ntime I guess,\nonly if I do not have a match.\n\n173\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.550\nSo how could I do that?\n\n174\n00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.940\nWell, let match, and\nI'm just gonna leave that undefined\n\n175\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.690\nand if I match, then I'm gonna say hey,\n\n176\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.110\nthere has been a match, so\nI have matched something.\n\n177\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:39.186\nIf there was not a match,\nlike right here if I never get to this,\n\n178\n00:10:39.186 --> 00:10:45.875\nI have typed a letter then I have\nto increase guessCount by 1.\n\n179\n00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:49.187\nNow let's go back through this\nI grab the key, I say hey,\n\n180\n00:10:49.187 --> 00:10:52.340\nI'm gonna create a variable called match.\n\n181\n00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.060\nIt's going to be true if there is a match.\n\n182\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.611\nAnd then otherwise it's going to be\nundefined, which will be false by nature,\n\n183\n00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:01.310\nso I can use that for decision making.\n\n184\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:06.891\nFor each piece of state, in this case\na letter and its associated hidden value,\n\n185\n00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:12.330\nif the letter matches the key, then\nunhide that letter and there was a match.\n\n186\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.110\nIf there is not a match, so\n\n187\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.780\nif I ever hit this inner part,\nthis will actually skip and not increment.\n\n188\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.670\nI don't wanna count the guesses against me\nif I actually got a letter correct, right?\n\n189\n00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.496\nSo then I'm going to\nincrement the guessCount,\n\n190\n00:11:28.496 --> 00:11:32.930\ncheck to see if I've won,\nand then render right.\n\n191\n00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:39.464\nNow check win, it's kinda hard to name\nthose checkWinOrLose maybe is a better\n\n192\n00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:46.100\none because it's seeing is this the end\nof the game have you won, have you lost?\n\n193\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.358\nAnd, let's just write\nan empty that does nothing.\n\n194\n00:11:50.358 --> 00:11:53.235\nJust so we can move on.\n\n195\n00:11:53.235 --> 00:11:55.801\nSo, here's our checkWinOrLose and\n\n196\n00:11:55.801 --> 00:11:59.703\nlet's see if guessCount\nupdates if I get things wrong.\n\n197\n00:11:59.703 --> 00:12:04.931\nSo, I'm gonna, and notice here I now have\nstarted updating that but right now I\n\n198\n00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:08.496\ncan just guess forever and ever and ever-\n&gt;&gt; As many times as you feel like.\n\n199\n00:12:08.496 --> 00:12:12.697\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm never gonna win or lose or-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n200\n00:12:12.697 --> 00:12:16.777\nwe just gotta put some fences around that\narea because like you said we just go buck\n\n201\n00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:20.282\nwild and have as many guesses as\nyou feel like, you're up to 116.\n\n202\n00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:20.795\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n203\n00:12:20.795 --> 00:12:22.965\n&gt;&gt; I actually just raked my hand across\n\n204\n00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:24.043\nthe keyboard.\nAnd I was like,\n\n205\n00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:26.145\nI don't know what this word is.\n&gt;&gt; And you found the word.\n\n206\n00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:27.133\n&gt;&gt; I did, I did but\n\n207\n00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:32.015\nwith unlimited guesses I could always win.\nBut I'm not actually confirmed that I win.\n\n208\n00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.839\nSo, let's see here checkWinOrLose,\nwhat does it gonna do?\n\n209\n00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:48.164\nIf the number of guesses,\nis greater than or\n\n210\n00:12:48.164 --> 00:12:51.406\nequal to the MAX_GUESSES.\n\n211\n00:12:51.406 --> 00:12:55.633\nAnd we're gonna use an alert here just as\npart of the development process we will\n\n212\n00:12:55.633 --> 00:12:58.472\ngo back and\nchange this cuz I don't like having alerts\n\n213\n00:12:58.472 --> 00:13:01.206\nthose pop ups that just bing,\nbing, bing, bing.\n\n214\n00:13:01.206 --> 00:13:03.639\n&gt;&gt; Very annoying\n&gt;&gt; Yeah incredibly annoying actually most\n\n215\n00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:06.424\nbrowsers allow you to ignore those\nif a site does those a bunch.\n\n216\n00:13:06.424 --> 00:13:08.670\nSo we're gonna use those for\ndevelopment purposes.\n\n217\n00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.850\nWe will go back and change those.\n\n218\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:18.628\nSo what do I wanna do if the guessCount\nis greater than or equal to MAX_GUESSES?\n\n219\n00:13:21.274 --> 00:13:24.146\nYou did not win.\n\n220\n00:13:24.146 --> 00:13:29.970\nI don't wanna commit to you lose but\nyou didn't win, right?\n\n221\n00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.606\nI mean, we should be nice.\n\n222\n00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:32.540\n&gt;&gt; Semantics.\n\n223\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.357\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n224\n00:13:33.357 --> 00:13:35.182\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but\n\n225\n00:13:35.182 --> 00:13:39.781\nif we don't get this we\nneed some further checks,\n\n226\n00:13:39.781 --> 00:13:44.990\nso, I need to see if all\nthe letters are shown, right?\n\n227\n00:13:46.182 --> 00:13:50.670\nSo allShown, and how are we gonna do that?\n\n228\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.921\nWell we're gonna use\nan array method onState.\n\n229\n00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:58.990\nSo for\nthe state I'm going to transform and for\n\n230\n00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.590\neach piece I want just\nthe piece.hidden property.\n\n231\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:11.951\nAnd actually let's just\nsee what that is doing.\n\n232\n00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:15.606\nSo if I refresh and I go to console and\nI come over here and\n\n233\n00:14:15.606 --> 00:14:20.854\nI click notice it is false, true, true,\ntrue, true so these are still hidden\n\n234\n00:14:20.854 --> 00:14:25.730\nI have guessed notice it didn't count\nagainst me because I got it right.\n\n235\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.470\nWhat if I well I'm-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If you pick one that's.\n\n236\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.460\n&gt;&gt; If I pick one it still increments but\nit doesn't change this.\n\n237\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:38.058\nSo I'm now checking to see is it hidden or\nnot for all of the letters?\n\n238\n00:14:38.058 --> 00:14:42.472\nOkay now that I have this array I can\nactually do what's called a reduction\n\n239\n00:14:42.472 --> 00:14:43.264\noperation.\n\n240\n00:14:43.264 --> 00:14:48.095\nIf I wanted to distill down\nwhether in general I have won or\n\n241\n00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:51.830\nnot, if all of these\nwere false I would win.\n\n242\n00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:57.529\nIf that is not the case then I would\nlose right or I have not won yet\n\n243\n00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:59.937\nuntil I've passed the guesses.\n\n244\n00:14:59.937 --> 00:15:03.248\nSo, I wanna check to see\nif all of these are falses.\n\n245\n00:15:03.248 --> 00:15:08.299\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nJustin why would you do that instead\n\n246\n00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:13.794\nof just checking to see\nif guesses equals 3?\n\n247\n00:15:13.794 --> 00:15:15.058\n&gt;&gt; Why would I check for\n\n248\n00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:19.400\neach one of these letters instead\nof seeing if guesses is equal to 3?\n\n249\n00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.820\nSo, if guesses is equal to 3,\nI didn't win.\n\n250\n00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.165\nHe's thinking he's in my head it's\nstill scaring me a little bit.\n\n251\n00:15:27.165 --> 00:15:31.720\nHe's thinking he's in my head it's\nstill scaring me a little bit.\n\n252\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.822\nSo it's kind of a disjoint process\nI actually have two kind of end\n\n253\n00:15:34.822 --> 00:15:35.692\nstates, right?\n\n254\n00:15:35.692 --> 00:15:40.160\nHe's thinking he's in my head it's\nstill scaring me a little bit.\n\n255\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.542\nHe's thinking he's in my head it's\nstill scaring me a little bit.\n\n256\n00:15:44.542 --> 00:15:48.338\nWell, I choose\n\n257\n00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:53.886\nthe reduction word For\n\n258\n00:15:53.886 --> 00:16:00.604\na very particular reason.\n\n259\n00:16:00.604 --> 00:16:03.930\nThere is a reduce,\nwhere I can take an array, and\n\n260\n00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.945\nkind of smash that down\ninto a single value.\n\n261\n00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:11.100\nAnd I'm gonna do that by taking the first,\nand the second.\n\n262\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.670\nOr better yet, let's call this\nthe current value, and the next value.\n\n263\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.819\nAnd that is going to give me current and\nnext.\n\n264\n00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:24.670\nAnd we're gonna start with true.\n\n265\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.240\nNow reduce takes a function on\nhow to combine values, pair wise.\n\n266\n00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.645\nSo if I go back here it would\nstart with false and true.\n\n267\n00:16:32.645 --> 00:16:37.230\nBut notice, I'm assuming that\nI start with the first one.\n\n268\n00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.140\nWell really I need to\ngive it a seed value.\n\n269\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.390\nSo I'm gonna start with a true over here,\ntrue and false.\n\n270\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.920\nWell, what is true and false?\n\n271\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.980\nWell, it is false.\n\n272\n00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:53.130\nSo let's see how this allShown works.\n\n273\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.666\nNow it is no longer an array, but\ninstead a single true false value.\n\n274\n00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:02.495\nUh-oh.\n\n275\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.320\nSemi colon here.\n\n276\n00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.130\nCan't chain operators with semi\ncolons at the ends of lines.\n\n277\n00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Gets you every time.\n\n278\n00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.363\n&gt;&gt; It'll wreck your life, wreck your life.\n\n279\n00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.016\nLet's see.\n\n280\n00:17:12.016 --> 00:17:12.652\nTrue.\n\n281\n00:17:14.278 --> 00:17:16.220\nSo you did not win.\n\n282\n00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.350\nThat's annoying.\n\n283\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:21.525\nBut notice,\nthat's not quiet what I wanted, right?\n\n284\n00:17:21.525 --> 00:17:27.730\nAllShown, should this be true\nif they're still all hidden?\n\n285\n00:17:30.106 --> 00:17:32.260\nI don't think so.\n\n286\n00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.970\nSo, what do we need to do?\n\n287\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.920\nHow can we change that?\n\n288\n00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:48.160\nWell, I think maybe we just change this.\n\n289\n00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.570\nRight, I just say not that.\n\n290\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:55.980\nI could change this function, but\nit is not whatever I've written here.\n\n291\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.190\nAnd there's multiple ways to do that.\n\n292\n00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:03.350\nAnd you'll also notice now that I've hit\na state to where every time I hit a key,\n\n293\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.210\nit pops up.\n\n294\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.860\nThat's annoying.\n\n295\n00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:14.440\nSo if we refresh, and I hit a key,\nI still got some weirdness going on here.\n\n296\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.130\nSo we probably need to think\nabout that a little bit more.\n\n297\n00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:24.320\nSo I map over each of the states, for each\npiece of the state I grab out the hidden.\n\n298\n00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.100\nI'm going to reduce that\nby taking the current and\n\n299\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.520\nthe next and I want to and those.\n\n300\n00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.897\nSo the only time that should be\ntrue is if they're all true.\n\n301\n00:18:39.355 --> 00:18:41.919\nSo, hm?\n\n302\n00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:46.190\nNotice there's a weird semantic here.\n\n303\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.740\nI said hidden as the property.\n\n304\n00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.140\nWell, I'm showing hidden.\n\n305\n00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.650\nWhat is this value?\n\n306\n00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.572\nShould it be if it represents\nwhether it's showing or not?\n\n307\n00:18:58.572 --> 00:19:01.550\nIt should in fact be\nthe opposite of hidden.\n\n308\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.730\nSo I'm gonna take the opposite\nof hidden and map through that.\n\n309\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.998\nAnd now we're gonna get- We're going\nto have to fix that real fast, Daniel.\n\n310\n00:19:08.998 --> 00:19:10.425\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n311\n00:19:10.425 --> 00:19:11.635\n&gt;&gt; So allShown?\n\n312\n00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:13.135\nNope, allShown?\n\n313\n00:19:13.135 --> 00:19:16.534\nNope.\n\n314\n00:19:16.534 --> 00:19:19.160\nAnd allShown now is true.\n\n315\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:24.423\nSo notice this tiny single character\ncauses me some weird logic error.\n\n316\n00:19:24.423 --> 00:19:26.225\nThat's kinda weird.\n\n317\n00:19:26.225 --> 00:19:27.970\nWhy is that working?\n\n318\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.310\nAnd this is a common thing\nthat people will do,\n\n319\n00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.070\nmake sure you're thinking in the context\nof how you name this properties.\n\n320\n00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.470\nSo hidden is true if it is hidden.\n\n321\n00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:43.900\nI wanna know if it's shown, right?\n\n322\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.290\nThen I need to reverse that\nto answer my question.\n\n323\n00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.270\nNow this is not the only way to do it but\n\n324\n00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.398\nthat is the most reproducible way that\nI've found that's easy to reason about.\n\n325\n00:19:55.398 --> 00:20:01.088\nSo now, if(allShown), well for\n\n326\n00:20:01.088 --> 00:20:06.783\nallShown, what should we do here?\n\n327\n00:20:06.783 --> 00:20:13.550\nProbably just alert('You win'), right?\n\n328\n00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.740\nSo we check win or lose.\n\n329\n00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.810\nIf the guessCount is greater than or\nequal to the max guesses, you do not win.\n\n330\n00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.350\nIf they're allShown,\n\n331\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.420\nwhich assumes that we are not past\nthe guessCount, then we do win.\n\n332\n00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.540\nWhat happens if neither\none of those are true?\n\n333\n00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.350\nWell, the game hasn't ended.\n\n334\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.120\nSo okay, let's see if this works out.\n\n335\n00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.162\nI think Daniel is like, I don't know.\n\n336\n00:20:37.162 --> 00:20:38.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n337\n00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:44.950\nSo if I refresh a c, an a,\nan r, an o, and a t, I win.\n\n338\n00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:45.810\nSo that works.\n\n339\n00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.170\nRight?\nI notice it renders after the last one,\n\n340\n00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.830\nand we can switch some things\naround to change that.\n\n341\n00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.980\nBut let's refresh.\n\n342\n00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.735\nWe are going to fix that very soon.\n\n343\n00:20:57.735 --> 00:21:00.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can see just\nthe look in his eyes and\n\n344\n00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.560\nsee that pop up come up and\nhe's like I'm getting mad.\n\n345\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.300\n&gt;&gt; You know it's funny\nI've done this to myself.\n\n346\n00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.513\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you did.\n\n347\n00:21:08.513 --> 00:21:09.671\n&gt;&gt; And it still agitates me.\n\n348\n00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:10.256\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n349\n00:21:10.256 --> 00:21:13.600\nthat should give you an idea of how\nagitating it can be to users if you're\n\n350\n00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.760\nlike I'm just gonna put\npop ups everywhere.\n\n351\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.150\nRight, there's good ways to do what\nare called modals, which are nice,\n\n352\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.150\nkinda like little fall over and\nthey disappear versus the bing.\n\n353\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.410\nSo also these are attached to keyboard\nevents, and that condition is true\n\n354\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.630\nafter the number of guesses have\nbeen exceeded or after you've won.\n\n355\n00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.070\nSo every time you hit a key, well,\n\n356\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.340\nit keeps-\n&gt;&gt; Popping up.\n\n357\n00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.366\n&gt;&gt; It keeps popping up.\n\n358\n00:21:36.366 --> 00:21:39.930\nSo, let's see here.\n\n359\n00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.381\nI'm just going to guess, you did not win.\n\n360\n00:21:42.381 --> 00:21:45.250\nAnd notice I've said guess\nis three out of three.\n\n361\n00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:51.170\nWhat if, I think this is mission.\n\n362\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.460\nI tried to refresh and it won't let me,\nyou gotta hit the refresh button.\n\n363\n00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.800\nWe will fix that.\n\n364\n00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.670\nSo, this is acres, I think.\n\n365\n00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.142\nSo, I'm going to guess a bunch of times.\n\n366\n00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:14.040\nThat actually did not record the guesses.\n\n367\n00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.930\nI was hitting the wrong keys there.\n\n368\n00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:16.588\nThat was interesting.\n\n369\n00:22:18.635 --> 00:22:20.302\nOkay, it's working now.\n\n370\n00:22:23.221 --> 00:22:27.500\nKinda, all right real quick we're\ngonna fix that before we move on.\n\n371\n00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:32.530\nWhat do I wanna do if you've either won or\nlost, right?\n\n372\n00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.130\nEither one of these\nconditions has been true.\n\n373\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.380\nI want to remove the event listener so\n\n374\n00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.150\npeople can actually get back\nthe keyboard control for the site.\n\n375\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.929\nSo I'm wanna say\nwindow.removeEventListener.\n\n376\n00:22:41.929 --> 00:22:47.470\nSo just like you can add,\nyou can remove event listener on keypress.\n\n377\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.330\nBut you still have to tell it what to\nremove because event listeners can\n\n378\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.970\nactually queue up a bunch of different\nfunctions for the same event.\n\n379\n00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:55.880\nAnd this should be key down.\n\n380\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.230\nSo I have to tell it what function\nto remove from that queue of\n\n381\n00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.650\nthings to fire off.\n\n382\n00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.290\nAnd I'm gonna grab this same thing here.\n\n383\n00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:07.890\nAnd boom.\n\n384\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:13.390\nSo if we refresh that,\nwe should not have that behavior anymore.\n\n385\n00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.127\nAnd there's a, and then if I hit e.\n\n386\n00:23:16.127 --> 00:23:18.191\nSo I've already guessed e.\n\n387\n00:23:21.175 --> 00:23:23.092\nT, so I did not win.\n\n388\n00:23:23.092 --> 00:23:25.578\nAnd then I can no longer type.\n\n389\n00:23:25.578 --> 00:23:30.436\nSo, Daniel, I think this actually\nmight work in our decision making\n\n390\n00:23:30.436 --> 00:23:33.380\nprocess of whether we win or not, right?\n\n391\n00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.040\n&gt;&gt; It seems to be doing exactly\nwhat we expect it to do anyway.\n\n392\n00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.593\n&gt;&gt; Right, now here's a common\nerror that I see people have.\n\n393\n00:23:40.593 --> 00:23:43.168\nThey'll take this and\nthey'll move it below.\n\n394\n00:23:43.168 --> 00:23:47.115\nAnd now, I may not quite get the outcome,\nI may get an extra guess and\n\n395\n00:23:47.115 --> 00:23:48.651\nit'll tell me I've won.\n\n396\n00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:51.400\nBut then shenanigans, right?\n\n397\n00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, I have to be careful there.\n\n398\n00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.940\nAnd this checking, win or lose,\nthis is sometimes an issue in games.\n\n399\n00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.710\nSo, let's go back through.\n\n400\n00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:06.770\nAnd I think we have a fully\nfunctioning version of Hangman, right?\n\n401\n00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.502\nLet's refresh.\n\n402\n00:24:09.911 --> 00:24:13.641\nI didn't win, okay.\n\n403\n00:24:13.641 --> 00:24:14.654\nI didn't win.\n\n404\n00:24:14.654 --> 00:24:16.470\nAnd now let's really try.\n\n405\n00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.850\nDaniel, I need a letter.\n\n406\n00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.838\n&gt;&gt; I'll take J.\n\n407\n00:24:19.838 --> 00:24:20.895\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n408\n00:24:20.895 --> 00:24:23.080\nE\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n409\n00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.238\n&gt;&gt; R\n&gt;&gt; It's carrot.\n\n410\n00:24:26.238 --> 00:24:28.140\n&gt;&gt; It's carrot.\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n411\n00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.670\n&gt;&gt; And I do win.\n\n412\n00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:34.870\nNow, you know Daniel, that alert thing,\nthat bothers me a great deal.\n\n413\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.500\nBut I'm not sure we have the time to\ngo back and change that and do our\n\n414\n00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.890\nlittle bit of refactoring that we need to\nso that we have a nice user interface.\n\n415\n00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.640\nMaybe that would be best\nleft to another episode?\n\n416\n00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthis is a good stopping spot, right?\n\n417\n00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.220\nWe've got the functionality\nas we want it to do.\n\n418\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.390\nAnd now we go back and do that\nrefactoring, make it look a little nicer,\n\n419\n00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.760\nmake it work a little nicer.\n\n420\n00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.335\nGet rid of the things that trigger\nhim into an outrageous rage.\n\n421\n00:24:57.335 --> 00:24:57.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n422\n00:24:57.955 --> 00:24:59.723\nwant to start stabbing his keyboard.\n\n423\n00:24:59.723 --> 00:25:03.042\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There is a glimmer of just fiery,\n\n424\n00:25:03.042 --> 00:25:04.384\nburning rage.\n\n425\n00:25:04.384 --> 00:25:05.247\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n426\n00:25:05.247 --> 00:25:07.520\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna get it.\n\n427\n00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Justin,\nlooking forward to that.\n\n428\n00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.080\nWe'll make that happen in a part three.\n\n429\n00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.350\nHopefully, you'll join us there.\n\n430\n00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:16.050\nBut as for this episode, Justin is right,\nwe've run out of time for this one.\n\n431\n00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.220\nSo we're gonna sign off.\n\n432\n00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.740\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n433\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Denison.\n\n434\n00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.165\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n435\n00:25:23.165

00:00:12.340\nYou're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.015\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:16.703\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:18.196\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:22.290\nin today's episode we are back with more\non our Intro to Wed Development series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.890\nComing back with another part on\nbuilding our Hangman application.\n\n9\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.740\nVery fun so far.\n\n10\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.660\nWe've got some cleaning up to do and\nsome other things we want to talk about.\n\n11\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.020\nSo, joining us yet again in the studio\nis our good friend, Mr Justin Denison.\n\n12\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.030\nJustin, welcome back sir.\n\n13\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.640\nI'm glad to have you today.\n\n14\n00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.380\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for those kind words, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.100\nI'm glad to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.140\nHow are you today?\n\n17\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.090\n&gt;&gt; I'm very well, thank you.\n\n18\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.615\n&gt;&gt; That's always good to hear.\n\n19\n00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:46.030\nYeah, we've seen Hangman kind of\nstart its progression down the road.\n\n20\n00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.170\nAnd there's a few things we wanna do,\n\n21\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.690\nbut before we do I think it's\nnow a good time for a refactor.\n\n22\n00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.550\nAnd there's a couple of things that we\nwill have to change during this refactor,\n\n23\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.930\njust to get everything kind\nof bundled up together.\n\n24\n00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.720\nSo, I think it's no better time\nthan now just to jump back in.\n\n25\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.820\nRight now,\nas it stands I can type letters.\n\n26\n00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.840\nOn this Window, as long as this Window\nis in focus, and I can play hangman.\n\n27\n00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.090\nSo, if I hop back over I have all of this\ninformation kind of globally set, right?\n\n28\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.980\nWell, I don't want that.\n\n29\n00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.960\nI want that to be, well, kinda\nencapsulated, kinda modular in nature.\n\n30\n00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.380\nAnd we could do this a couple of ways.\n\n31\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.800\nWe could build a class or\nwe could build an object.\n\n32\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.370\nAnd today, we've seen in previous\nepisodes, if you haven't seen that,\n\n33\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.370\ndefinitely go check those out.\n\n34\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.660\nWe've done it with an object,\nwe've done it with a class.\n\n35\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.360\nI'm gonna hop back into\nthe object paradigm just for fun.\n\n36\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.290\nSo, I'm gonna say, Let's say here,\nWe have our empty object.\n\n37\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.470\nSo, we need to bring all of our data here,\nand this refractor as we do this,\n\n38\n00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.680\nwe don't also get a fully functioning\napplication until everything's fixed.\n\n39\n00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.690\nAnd that can be an incredibly frustrating\npart of this, but just keep persisting.\n\n40\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.167\nYou will get there, and let's see here\nI've got MAX_GUESSES: and that will be 3.\n\n41\n00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:12.022\nNow, remember because this is part of\nan object now I can no longer keep that\n\n42\n00:02:12.022 --> 00:02:15.270\nstatic binding that const\nkind of help goes away.\n\n43\n00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.520\nSo, we do give up some niceties but this\nallows us to move this around together.\n\n44\n00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.190\nLets go ahead and make words.\n\n45\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.240\nAnd I'm just gonna copy and paste those.\n\n46\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.380\nThere's no sense in retyping those.\n\n47\n00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.760\nAnd these words that's a point of\ninterest, I've hard coded this.\n\n48\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.620\nThis would be a good time where\nmaybe you build some kinda service\n\n49\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.220\nwhere there's a file that just\nhas this on a server somewhere.\n\n50\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.150\nAnd then,\nif you can make calls to that service.\n\n51\n00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.810\nWell, that would be helpful.\n\n52\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.977\nI think it's a little beyond\nthe scope of what we're doing today.\n\n53\n00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:52.663\nBut do keep in mind that\nis one way to remedy that '\n\n54\n00:02:52.663 --> 00:02:55.940\nI got carrot four times in a row\nwhen I was refreshing the page.\n\n55\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.540\nI just need to make that word list bigger.\n\n56\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.640\nOr, as Daniel has suggested, we could\njust keep track of the previous word and\n\n57\n00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.870\njust make sure we don't get\nthe same one in a row each time.\n\n58\n00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.900\nAnd then, guessCount, that is going\nto start at 0, and then randomWord.\n\n59\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.260\nNotice how randomWord is kinda dynamic,\nand so is state?\n\n60\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.350\nSo, we're not gonna be able to\nset those initially, right?\n\n61\n00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.500\nWe need some other things to come\ninto play before those can be set.\n\n62\n00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.346\nSo.\nthese are the only static sets of data\n\n63\n00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:29.577\nthat I can have.\n\n64\n00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:30.814\nSo, we're gonna stop there.\n\n65\n00:03:30.814 --> 00:03:35.486\nAnd following,\nkind of our same paradigm here.\n\n66\n00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:37.390\nI'm gonna have an init.\n\n67\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.020\nAnd notice,\n\n68\n00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.850\nI've written this a little bit differently\nthan other times I've written objects.\n\n69\n00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.500\nAnd that's because I'm using\nthe new ES6 shorthand.\n\n70\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.350\nWe don't have to say init is a function,\nyou got to spell function,\n\n71\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.990\nright, that's important.\n\n72\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.260\nBut instead, I'm gonna say this\nis a method on this object.\n\n73\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.700\nSo I can short hand it,\nvery similar to classes and\n\n74\n00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.400\nthere's a reason that those kinda\ncame into play at the same time.\n\n75\n00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.240\nSo I have init, I have cacheDom, I have\n\n76\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.040\naddListeners and\nyou'll notice this is the same pattern,\n\n77\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.320\nI'm following this pattern over and\nover and over again.\n\n78\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.100\nThat's really drawing in into my brain.\n\n79\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.980\nSo, I don't have to think about this and\nmaybe eventually\n\n80\n00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.020\nI can employ this pattern from the very\nbeginning and start that chunking out.\n\n81\n00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.920\nMaybe not always impossible to do that,\nI can do, as I said before,\n\n82\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.160\ngo with make it work, and then re-factor.\n\n83\n00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.220\nAnd then, I have a render.\n\n84\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.420\nAnd I also know that I need\na few other functions here.\n\n85\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.700\nI need guess, check win or\nlose, and get random word.\n\n86\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.372\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n87\n00:04:50.372 --> 00:04:55.654\nsay guess checkInOrLose, and\n\n88\n00:04:55.654 --> 00:05:00.945\ngetRandomWord, there we go.\n\n89\n00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:07.420\nSo now, I have all of these kind\nof chunked up into my application.\n\n90\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.280\nAnd well, let's see,\nwhat do we wanna do in init?\n\n91\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.114\nI wanna say, this.cacheDom();\n\n92\n00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:21.280\nthis.addListeners(); this.render.\n\n93\n00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.350\nBut, this is where it gets a little weird.\n\n94\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.550\nThis is one of those applications that\nhave broken this pattern a little bit.\n\n95\n00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.570\nI have to be able to think about this.\n\n96\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.160\nI have these couple of\npieces of information.\n\n97\n00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.530\nBut, I need to be set before I can\ncacheDom, addlisteners or render reliably.\n\n98\n00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.590\nSo within a nit,\nI'm going to change this a little bit.\n\n99\n00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.389\nI'm gonna say this.randomWord =\n\n100\n00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:53.600\nthis.getrandomword for this.words.\n\n101\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.010\nSo.\nit's very similar to\n\n102\n00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.770\nthe line 22 statement, but I'm using\na randomWord inside of the object.\n\n103\n00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.530\nAnd I'm passing the object's\nproperty of words, so\n\n104\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.860\nnow random word is assigned there.\n\n105\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.590\nAnd I'm going to say state is ...,\n\n106\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.210\nI'm gonna spread those\napart this.randomWord.\n\n107\n00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:27.369\nAnd then, I'm gonna copy the rest of this\njust to keep things expeditious in nature.\n\n108\n00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.278\nAnd here we go.\n\n109\n00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:33.910\nSo, we paste and\nI think everything's good.\n\n110\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.420\nWhat I'm actually gonna do is go ahead and\nsay, hangman.init and\n\n111\n00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.708\nlet's just see what hangman.\n\n112\n00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:46.770\nUh-oh, cannot read property symbol\niterator of this dot state,\n\n113\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.770\nthis dot random word,\nand why did that occur.\n\n114\n00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.330\nWell, guess what this.randomWord\nis currently assigned to.\n\n115\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.700\nWell, getRandomWord is not defined in this\nobject, so I need to fix that real quick.\n\n116\n00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.715\nSo, I'm just gonna go down here and\ngrab the inner part of getRandomWord.\n\n117\n00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:09.966\nAnd go ahead and\nfill that in because that is necessary for\n\n118\n00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:11.790\nthis initialization to occur.\n\n119\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.760\nAnd wordArray.\n\n120\n00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.575\nThere we are.\n\n121\n00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:22.845\nAnd then, I'm gonna refresh, and\n\n122\n00:07:22.845 --> 00:07:28.770\nnow I can go back to my console and\njust look at, there we go.\n\n123\n00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.260\nOkay, so notice that randomWord\nis assigned to mission.\n\n124\n00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:39.770\nAnd if I look at state, state is that\nmi -with whether it's hidden or not.\n\n125\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.450\nSo, that set up has\noccurred it's working well.\n\n126\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.779\nNow, we need to cache the dome.\n\n127\n00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.941\nSo, that's very similar to here.\n\n128\n00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:55.391\nAnd I'm actually going to just copy that,\nput this in cacheDom and\n\n129\n00:07:55.391 --> 00:08:01.263\nthen paste and all of these consts\nJust gonna add this to it but\n\n130\n00:08:01.263 --> 00:08:07.850\nI have to go back and\nadd this.app, this.app right here.\n\n131\n00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.400\nSo if we go back and refresh and\n\n132\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.250\nlook at hangman again and\nwe drop that down, notice that.\n\n133\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.650\nWhere is it, there we go.\n\n134\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.630\nThere's app and there's our guessesOutput,\nand then there's our lettersOutput.\n\n135\n00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.270\nWe're good to go.\n\n136\n00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.070\nNow I want to add listeners.\n\n137\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.020\nNow here's where some of these\nchanges are gonna be made.\n\n138\n00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.353\nI wanna make sure that this works,\nbut right now,\n\n139\n00:08:32.353 --> 00:08:36.374\nI'm listening to the entire window, which\nmeans I can't have multiple instances.\n\n140\n00:08:36.374 --> 00:08:41.864\nI'm kind of polluting the Global NameSpace\nagain by attaching things to the window.\n\n141\n00:08:41.864 --> 00:08:43.831\nSo we got to figure out a way to fix it.\n\n142\n00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:48.073\nBut for now, we're gonna leave it be and\nthere we go.\n\n143\n00:08:48.073 --> 00:08:49.200\nAnd then what is render?\n\n144\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.900\nWell render is this junk right here and\n\n145\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.100\nI have to grab all of that.\n\n146\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.142\nAnd we have to add a lot of these, right?\n\n147\n00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:03.997\nI'm talking about this Hangman game.\n\n148\n00:09:05.741 --> 00:09:09.639\nSo render, Looks good,\n\n149\n00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:14.765\nexcept lettersOutput has to be this and\nthen the state is part of this object.\n\n150\n00:09:14.765 --> 00:09:17.220\nIt's specific to this object.\n\n151\n00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.851\nAnd then that looks good, that looks good.\n\n152\n00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:24.873\nNeed a this there and a this there,\n\n153\n00:09:24.873 --> 00:09:29.182\na this there and I think a this there.\n\n154\n00:09:29.182 --> 00:09:31.710\nSo, let's go see if that works.\n\n155\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.180\nNothing has broken.\n\n156\n00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.390\nOkay, so if we have that correct we should\nbe able to start commenting out this.\n\n157\n00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.698\nBut let's go ahead and\nfinish up with guess checkWinOrLose.\n\n158\n00:09:45.698 --> 00:09:50.970\nSo guess is gonna grab all\nof the innards of guess and\n\n159\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.480\ngo to the actual guess method.\n\n160\n00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.800\nAnd make sure you pass the event because\nthis is part of the event handler.\n\n161\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.820\nAnd I'm going to say for\nthis state, this guessCount\n\n162\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:11.420\nand this object's checkWinOrLose,\nand then this .render.\n\n163\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.260\nOkay let's go see if that's broken.\n\n164\n00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.720\nI refresh,\neverything's still looking good.\n\n165\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.280\nNotice I'm checking periodically\njust to see if I'm getting errors.\n\n166\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.490\nIf I'm not getting errors I'm good to go.\n\n167\n00:10:22.932 --> 00:10:28.370\nNow checkWinOrLose I also want to move\nthat into the object and here we go.\n\n168\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.560\nSo there's checkWinOrLose.\n\n169\n00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.030\nAnd there we go.\n\n170\n00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:39.110\nJust getting a little bewildered there for\na minute, Daniel.\n\n171\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.687\nAnd then I need this.guessCount,\n\n172\n00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:47.900\nthis.MAX_GUESSES, and I think that's it.\n\n173\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.917\nWe're good to go.\n\n174\n00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:53.002\nUp into this point, I should be able\nto comment out everything else.\n\n175\n00:10:53.002 --> 00:10:56.810\nAnd don't forget that you have to\ninitialize this application like I do\n\n176\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:57.322\nit here.\n\n177\n00:10:57.322 --> 00:11:03.448\nSo I'm going to comment that out,\nrefresh, guess is not defined.\n\n178\n00:11:03.448 --> 00:11:09.702\nIf I use my dev tools to help\nme find that error, there it is.\n\n179\n00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:10.820\nWhoopsy daisy.\n\n180\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.840\n&gt;&gt; A little crazy.\n\n181\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it went a little crazy.\n\n182\n00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.810\nSo, I need to go find everywhere I\nhave attached an event listener.\n\n183\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.280\nI need this type of guest.\n\n184\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.912\nNow, I have to be careful because inside\nof guess I'm using the this keyword.\n\n185\n00:11:26.912 --> 00:11:31.804\nBecause I'm using the this keyword it\nactually refers to the object that\n\n186\n00:11:31.804 --> 00:11:33.740\nthe event originates from.\n\n187\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.940\nSo I have to bind [SOUND] to\nthe context of this object,\n\n188\n00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.720\nthis hangman object,\nall together and pass that through.\n\n189\n00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.110\nSo I'm kind of pushing that information.\n\n190\n00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.030\nI'm changing what this means\ninside of guess by binding.\n\n191\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.634\nAnd then I also need to say this.guess,\n\n192\n00:11:52.634 --> 00:11:58.151\nbecause it's this object's\nguess method and this.guess.\n\n193\n00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:01.871\nSo if I refresh,\nI think I'm good to go here.\n\n194\n00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:06.673\nSo let's go check it out,\nstate is not defined,\n\n195\n00:12:06.673 --> 00:12:10.910\naha, I forgot [INAUDIBLE] in the refactor.\n\n196\n00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.410\nIt happens.\n\n197\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.200\nAnd I'm looking for\nthis state, this object state.\n\n198\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.030\nThat should actually do it for us.\n\n199\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:26.140\nI say that, and it looks like our hangman\ngame is finally back to working condition.\n\n200\n00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:26.772\nThat's good.\n\n201\n00:12:26.772 --> 00:12:30.472\nAnd now I have this kind of bundled up and\nI can just move it around.\n\n202\n00:12:30.472 --> 00:12:35.043\nAs long as I have this object,\nwhich looks very complicated.\n\n203\n00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:39.009\nBut if I wrap it up that's all\nyou would necessarily see.\n\n204\n00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:43.110\nI can minimize that and\njust put it in a file in and of itself.\n\n205\n00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.770\nAnd then I can just call init\nwhenever init is appropriate.\n\n206\n00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.820\nI don't have to initialize the game right\noff the bat, and that's what's important.\n\n207\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.170\nAnd then in index,\nI need that right there.\n\n208\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.680\nAnd so now, I'm always going\nto be referring to the app.\n\n209\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.710\nI could refactor this further,\nto where I could pass the id and\n\n210\n00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:05.390\nhave multiple instances\nof the application.\n\n211\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.460\nIf you want to see something like that,\n\n212\n00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.480\ndefinitely check out some\nprevious videos in the series.\n\n213\n00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.750\nAlways good to know those things.\n\n214\n00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.580\nBut there is one final thing\nthat I want to change.\n\n215\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.420\nBecause it almost puts me\ninto a fiery fit of rage.\n\n216\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.950\n&gt;&gt; You're going to put\na dragon in the background.\n\n217\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.402\n&gt;&gt; That would actually be pretty awesome.\n\n218\n00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:25.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I feel like you're overselling it,\n\n219\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.160\nyou're overselling it a little bit.\n\n220\n00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:34.830\nIf we look what happens when I win or\nwhen I lose?\n\n221\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.237\n&gt;&gt; You get those lovely\nalert boxes that pop up.\n\n222\n00:13:37.237 --> 00:13:38.072\nI do.\n\n223\n00:13:38.072 --> 00:13:39.123\n&gt;&gt; He loves them.\n\n224\n00:13:39.123 --> 00:13:40.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I put them there and\n\n225\n00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.721\nthey still make me grit my teeth\na little bit when they would pop up.\n\n226\n00:13:45.721 --> 00:13:47.760\nDaniel found it hilarious, I did not.\n\n227\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.640\n&gt;&gt; It was a good time for me.\n\n228\n00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.270\n&gt;&gt; Also, there's other thing, this isn't\nquite separated from the global namespace.\n\n229\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.500\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nhow we can fix that.\n\n230\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:04.937\nSo first, I say we figure out how\nto get this alert to go away.\n\n231\n00:14:04.937 --> 00:14:11.073\nAnd part of that is maybe\nI add an additional\n\n232\n00:14:11.073 --> 00:14:17.385\nsection here that has\nthe class of message.\n\n233\n00:14:17.385 --> 00:14:22.348\nSo now I'm gonna use this as just\na message, and I need to add some CSS so\n\n234\n00:14:22.348 --> 00:14:24.633\nthis displays appropriately.\n\n235\n00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:26.350\nSo there are my guesses.\n\n236\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.790\nI'm gonna keep guesses.\n\n237\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.870\nI'm just gonna copy and paste,\nagain this is on the fly.\n\n238\n00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.449\nI'm just trying to work\nthrough this a little bit.\n\n239\n00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:40.011\nAnd for guesses,\nI'm gonna change this border to black.\n\n240\n00:14:40.011 --> 00:14:47.586\nBut I'm going to change the background\ncolor to, I think, light green.\n\n241\n00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:48.871\nYeah, there we go.\n\n242\n00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:52.080\nAnd if we refresh there\nare those pop ups again.\n\n243\n00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.680\nWe're gonna fix that.\n\n244\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:00.410\nSo there's that light green and I don't\nknow, we'll have to be careful of that.\n\n245\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.110\nI actually want to have\nthis display of none.\n\n246\n00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.813\nI don't want it to be there until\nI've either won or I've lost.\n\n247\n00:15:07.813 --> 00:15:10.178\nSo I'm kinda gonna turn that on.\n\n248\n00:15:10.178 --> 00:15:12.820\nAnd it's gonna pop up only\nwhen those conditions are met.\n\n249\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.350\nKind of like an alert that you would see,\nat the top of some websites.\n\n250\n00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:24.320\nSo if I refresh, hm, well, you actually\nhave to use the appropriate classes.\n\n251\n00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.544\nSo instead of guesses,\nthis should be message.\n\n252\n00:15:28.544 --> 00:15:32.594\nAnd so refresh, and\nnow I'm back to everything appears normal.\n\n253\n00:15:32.594 --> 00:15:36.570\nBut if I inspect in the elements,\nI do have this.\n\n254\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.664\nIt is hidden though by\nsetting display of none.\n\n255\n00:15:39.664 --> 00:15:44.317\nNow because I've added a new\nportion of the layout,\n\n256\n00:15:44.317 --> 00:15:48.876\nI have to change,\nwell you guessed it, cacheDom.\n\n257\n00:15:48.876 --> 00:15:51.864\nBecause I already have\nthis all put together.\n\n258\n00:15:51.864 --> 00:15:58.168\nThat's easy to do, so this.message\noutput = this.app.querySelector\n\n259\n00:16:00.824 --> 00:16:07.730\nMessage, okay so I now have that section\nand then what would I want to do with it?\n\n260\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.698\nWe're gonna use this message output\nportion to actually output the message\n\n261\n00:16:11.698 --> 00:16:13.630\ninstead of those pesky alert boxes.\n\n262\n00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.230\nSo if we look down and\nwe see alert, you did not win.\n\n263\n00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.630\nAlert you won or you win, right?\n\n264\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:26.760\nWell, I could just make code\ninside of this that would do,\n\n265\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:32.240\nsetting it to a display that is\nappropriate, but also setting the message.\n\n266\n00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.610\nBut I know that each time I'm going to be\nsetting the display to something visible.\n\n267\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.180\nAnd I'm going to be setting to a message.\n\n268\n00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.566\nWell, that's a very repetitive in\nnature and in my mind I'm like,\n\n269\n00:16:43.566 --> 00:16:46.580\nthat's probably a good separate function.\n\n270\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.600\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd a method here of showMessage.\n\n271\n00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.086\nAnd what does showMessage going to do?\n\n272\n00:16:54.086 --> 00:17:01.867\nIt's gonna take this\nmessageOutput.style.display and\n\n273\n00:17:01.867 --> 00:17:03.893\nset it to flex.\n\n274\n00:17:03.893 --> 00:17:05.270\nWe're using flexbox here.\n\n275\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.581\nAgain, just as reminder,\n\n276\n00:17:06.581 --> 00:17:09.603\nmileage may vary depending on\nthe browser that you're using.\n\n277\n00:17:09.603 --> 00:17:15.996\nAnd then also this\nmessageOutput.textContent =.\n\n278\n00:17:15.996 --> 00:17:17.933\nWell, what are we gonna put there?\n\n279\n00:17:17.933 --> 00:17:21.037\nWell, I'm actually going\nto pass a message in.\n\n280\n00:17:21.037 --> 00:17:24.635\nAnd it's gotta follow a very similar\nlayout as the alert did, right?\n\n281\n00:17:24.635 --> 00:17:27.790\nI just pass a message in here,\nand a message in here.\n\n282\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.062\nAnd these are the exact same functions.\n\n283\n00:17:30.062 --> 00:17:31.487\nSo, that gives me an idea.\n\n284\n00:17:31.487 --> 00:17:36.258\nMaybe I can just create\na function that is general enough\n\n285\n00:17:36.258 --> 00:17:39.220\nto get done what I need to get done.\n\n286\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.850\nSo, I'm gonna set that to message.\n\n287\n00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.422\nAnd be very careful, this message\nwill set it to anything you want.\n\n288\n00:17:43.422 --> 00:17:47.037\nYou can pass at anything is\nthis will turn to a string.\n\n289\n00:17:47.037 --> 00:17:51.160\nSo if you accidentally pass in a object\nas a message, it'll just say object.\n\n290\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.631\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n291\n00:17:52.631 --> 00:18:00.600\nAnd as a result, I can change this to\nthis.showMessage and this.showMessage.\n\n292\n00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.900\nAnd we should probably test\nthat to see if it works out.\n\n293\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.230\nAll right, everything looks good.\n\n294\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.360\nI have no errors here, and I did not win.\n\n295\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:10.960\nHey.\n\n296\n00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.144\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n297\n00:18:12.144 --> 00:18:13.630\nWhat about if I do win?\n\n298\n00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.970\n&gt;&gt; I think it's carrot.\n\n299\n00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.151\n&gt;&gt; I tried carrot.\nThat was my first one.\n\n300\n00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:19.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You win.\n\n301\n00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.790\nSo now I have this little message alert\noutput and it's not nearly as agitating.\n\n302\n00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.920\nThere's one final change that I want to\nmake and that's, I don't want this to list\n\n303\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.650\ninto the entire window because I want this\nto be independent of the window itself.\n\n304\n00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.380\nI want it to be kind of encapsulated\nwithin the little bit of layout and\n\n305\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.390\nthis JavaScript that work together.\n\n306\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.750\nSo, I use window for the event listeners.\n\n307\n00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:49.665\nAnd that's because if we think back,\nI couldn't get it to listen to keyboard or\n\n308\n00:18:49.665 --> 00:18:53.579\nkey presses as if I used anything else but\nthe window.\n\n309\n00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:57.667\nWell, I did a little bit of research.\n\n310\n00:18:57.667 --> 00:19:01.127\nI showed this to some compatriots and\ncomrades and they're like,\n\n311\n00:19:01.127 --> 00:19:03.440\nthat's kind of annoying.\n\n312\n00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.882\nOur boss is like,\nno can't have it on the window object.\n\n313\n00:19:05.882 --> 00:19:12.180\nSo, did some research and\nI found out that if you take this app,\n\n314\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:19.150\nwhich is the containing div and I set\na property called tabindex to something.\n\n315\n00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.620\nAll right, and realistically this\nshould be part of your construction.\n\n316\n00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.460\nYou should pass this is as an object\nconstruction because you want\n\n317\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.970\nthem all to be one.\n\n318\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.940\nThis allows you to focus on that div,\nlike you would on an input box.\n\n319\n00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.030\nRight, I click on the input box.\n\n320\n00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.400\nYou get that nice little ring around it.\n\n321\n00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.030\nYou are focused.\n\n322\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.830\nYou can type within it.\n\n323\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:37.990\nAnd you type text.\n\n324\n00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:41.790\nIf you set the tabindex,\nthat allows you to focus on that div.\n\n325\n00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.828\nWell now I can say,\nthis.app.AddEventListener.\n\n326\n00:19:47.828 --> 00:19:53.184\nAnd likewise,\nthis.app.removeEventListener.\n\n327\n00:19:53.184 --> 00:20:00.214\nSo if I refresh, if I click, notice I\nhave this nice little highlighted and\n\n328\n00:20:00.214 --> 00:20:06.035\nif I start typing things it still\nbehaves exactly as I expect.\n\n329\n00:20:06.035 --> 00:20:09.860\nAnd if you want this to go away\nthat little highlight, right?\n\n330\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.578\nYou don't it to be known that\nyou're using the tabindex there.\n\n331\n00:20:13.578 --> 00:20:15.120\nYou can remove it with CSS.\n\n332\n00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.040\nAnd maybe that's a challenge for you.\n\n333\n00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.530\nSo, a couple of takeaways.\n\n334\n00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.900\nWe've actually now completely\nencapsulated this.\n\n335\n00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.410\nThe window object is no longer required\nin order to listen to key presses.\n\n336\n00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.618\nAnd that's really, really nice.\n\n337\n00:20:30.618 --> 00:20:31.810\nWhat could you do from here?\n\n338\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.380\nWhat could you kinda make this better?\n\n339\n00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.307\nFigure out a way to\nmake this a giant list.\n\n340\n00:20:37.307 --> 00:20:41.701\nAnd I challenge you further to don't just\ncopy and paste a giant list in there.\n\n341\n00:20:41.701 --> 00:20:44.844\nSee if you can do it programmatically\nto where if the list changes,\n\n342\n00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:47.214\nthen your application\ncan respond accordingly.\n\n343\n00:20:47.214 --> 00:20:49.620\nYou don't have to copy and\npaste each time something changes.\n\n344\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.420\nAlso, see if you can make it to\nwhere you can have two instances\n\n345\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.710\nof Hangman that behave\nindependently on the page,\n\n346\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:59.780\nas you've seen in some\nof the previous videos.\n\n347\n00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.370\nIf you haven't checked those out,\ndefinitely go check those out.\n\n348\n00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.727\nAnd I think that'll help you instill,\n\n349\n00:21:04.727 --> 00:21:07.415\nthis is how this is all\nstarting to work together.\n\n350\n00:21:07.415 --> 00:21:11.214\nSo, Daniel, I think that actually\ngets us to a good stopping point,\n\n351\n00:21:11.214 --> 00:21:13.220\nkind of a holistic approach.\n\n352\n00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.686\nIt's not a final polished shippable\nversion but it's pretty close.\n\n353\n00:21:17.686 --> 00:21:18.759\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's definitely close.\n\n354\n00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:20.376\nWe got great functionality.\n\n355\n00:21:20.376 --> 00:21:23.027\nThe user interface is a whole lot easier.\n\n356\n00:21:23.027 --> 00:21:25.660\nDoesn't make people as\nangry as they once did.\n\n357\n00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.820\nSo that's always nice, right?\n\n358\n00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.760\nWe don't want our users shooting\nthe screen or beating their computers with\n\n359\n00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.280\nclaw hammers because our alert\nboxes are driving them insane.\n\n360\n00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.278\nI'm speaking specifically of Justin.\n\n361\n00:21:34.278 --> 00:21:35.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.020\n&gt;&gt; Now Daniel,\n\n363\n00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.070\ndon't act like you never,\nyou never felt like wow,\n\n364\n00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.140\nI can just envision my hand\ngoing through this screen.\n\n365\n00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.820\nAnd not have to worry about it anymore.\n\n366\n00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.640\n&gt;&gt; Well if you haven't when you try\nto start doing this kind of thing,\n\n367\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.550\nyou surely will.\n\n368\n00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:53.160\nThat being said it looks like you did\na great job of walking us through.\n\n369\n00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.250\nYeah Hang Man is a simplistic\ntype of game, something easy,\n\n370\n00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.010\nthat you would think, yeah we're going\nto make this little simple game.\n\n371\n00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.380\nBut as you saw,\nit took a lot of logical out thinking and\n\n372\n00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.900\nmethodology to go through and\nmake it work and\n\n373\n00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.990\nreact in the way in which you would think\nsomeone would want it to work and react.\n\n374\n00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.380\nSo there's a little more to it.\n\n375\n00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.130\nAnd Justin did a fine job\nof explaining those things.\n\n376\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.898\nA lot of complexity going on in there.\n\n377\n00:22:15.898 --> 00:22:22.271\n[LAUGH] There was a few lines of code\nto get the final product out to market.\n\n378\n00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:24.216\nThat being said,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n379\n00:22:24.216 --> 00:22:25.276\nWe do thank you for joining us.\n\n380\n00:22:25.276 --> 00:22:26.805\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n381\n00:22:26.805 --> 00:22:30.275\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n382\n00:22:30.275

00:00:08.442\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:12.456\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:14.318\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:17.080\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.790\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand, in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.990\nwe are back with more on our\nIntro To Web Cevelopment.\n\n9\n00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.900\nAnother one of our wonderful\nLet's Build It episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.520\nJoining me today to explain what it\nis exactly we're gonna build and\n\n11\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.430\nhow we're gonna do that very thing,\nour good friend Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n12\n00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.190\nJustin, welcome back, man, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.110\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, thanks for\nhaving me back, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.730\nHow are you today?\n\n15\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, thanks.\n\n16\n00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.980\n&gt;&gt; That's always good to know.\n\n17\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.930\nYeah, The Build It series is always fun.\n\n18\n00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.770\nNot necessarily the most deployable,\npractical, production type code.\n\n19\n00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.617\nBut, it is a good learning experience,\nand, if nothing else,\n\n20\n00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:51.385\nyou learn these little tidbits\nthat you store away for later.\n\n21\n00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.800\nAnd you go, yeah,\nI'm gonna remember that next time.\n\n22\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.280\nSo, what are we going to build?\n\n23\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.852\nWell, I've always wondered, if I mapped\nnotes of a piano to a keyboard and\n\n24\n00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:07.999\nthen typed like Shakespeare,\nwould that make appropriate sounds?\n\n25\n00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:12.011\nI actually saw a gentleman map\nthe notes to zero through nine,\n\n26\n00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:15.340\nand then just play the first\nthousand digits of pi.\n\n27\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.270\nI know that sounds super nerdy,\nbut it actually made music.\n\n28\n00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.430\nAnd I was like, that's crazy,\nI wanna try something like that.\n\n29\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.060\nAnd in that vein,\nwe're gonna make a piano, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.070\nSo I use air quotes,\nbecause it's not a full piano,\n\n31\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.690\nI don't have several octaves of notes,\nor even flats or sharps.\n\n32\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.390\nBut we're gonna map our\nkeyboard to sounds.\n\n33\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.640\nAnd the whole purpose is,\n\n34\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.480\nwe need to know a little more about\nhandling some key press events.\n\n35\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.450\nWe also need to look at using HTML\nto help us make these decisions,\n\n36\n00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.340\nto simplify some of these\nevent based decisions.\n\n37\n00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.100\nAnd we'll actually see some\nCSS transitions that give\n\n38\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.859\nus some subtle feedback about\nhow things are working.\n\n39\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.110\nBut, I think there's no better\ntime than now to get started.\n\n40\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.676\nThis may take a little while,\nso we'll see how it goes.\n\n41\n00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:10.810\nSo, I'm in Chrome, I got my atom open, but\n\n42\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.220\nI need to make a folder to\nhold all of this stuff.\n\n43\n00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.780\nSo, I have a new folder and\nlets just call it piano.\n\n44\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.230\nAnd I'm gonna hop into Atom,\nand open that.\n\n45\n00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.230\nBecause I need to make a few files.\n\n46\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.940\nSo, let's add a project folder and\n\n47\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.930\nhop in to piano, and\nthere's nothing in there.\n\n48\n00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.720\nNow, we need three files, I will tell\nyou this piano thing doesn't really,\n\n49\n00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.720\nunless it has some visual aspects to it.\n\n50\n00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.950\nIt doesn't have great appeal,\nyou're like that's nice.\n\n51\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.390\nYou're playing random sounds as I tap\nbuttons on my keyboard, I don't like this.\n\n52\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.240\nSo we will go ahead and add some CSS\nfairly soon and, again, just to help\n\n53\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.570\nus for the development process, to help us\nvisualize what it is that we're building?\n\n54\n00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.500\nSo, I need a couple of files,\nI need an index or three files,\n\n55\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.646\na couple insinuates two.\n\n56\n00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:11.710\nI need main.css, and, as always,\nI'm going with app.js.\n\n57\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.730\nNow, I can name these anything I want.\n\n58\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.621\nI'm just using some conventions that I\nuse from time to time to keep things\n\n59\n00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:18.390\nconsistent.\n\n60\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.879\nLike app.js, when we're done,\nwe could rename it to piano.js and\n\n61\n00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.090\nthat would make sense.\n\n62\n00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.380\nSo, I'm also gonna open this up.\n\n63\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.150\nBefore I do, we always need to test,\nis this working.\n\n64\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.480\nThat is not how you spell working.\n\n65\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.480\nAnd CSS body is going\nhave a background color.\n\n66\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.580\nAnd I'm gonna use a hex code, and I'm not\nsure what this hex code is gonna produce.\n\n67\n00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.152\nSo, we just gonna kinda,\nLean on the keyboard here.\n\n68\n00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:58.520\nThat's too many, there we go,\n[LAUGH] too many.\n\n69\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.690\nAnd notice, I'm using a plugin in\nAtom that will let me go ahead and\n\n70\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.600\nknow this is gonna be\na kind of a hot purple.\n\n71\n00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.797\nSo this is just a test to make\nsure my CSS is on the page.\n\n72\n00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:13.148\nAnd let's get our HTML started, and\n\n73\n00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:20.404\nPiano, link up our main.css and\nour script tag.\n\n74\n00:04:20.404 --> 00:04:25.810\nSo our src='app,js', now a quick aside,\n\n75\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.800\nI actually almost did\na common mistake that\n\n76\n00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.970\nI've seen people do before, scr.\n\n77\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.449\nWe're gonna leave it like that and\nsee what happens.\n\n78\n00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:45.760\nSo, I'm gonna open my index.HTML and\nI gotta find it.\n\n79\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.800\nWhere you at?\n\n80\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.400\nThere we go, so, index.HTML, and\nI open, we gotta change that soon.\n\n81\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.860\nSo the CSS came onto the page, but notice,\nI don't have working printed here.\n\n82\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.570\nSo when people start initially,\nhere's what they do.\n\n83\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.450\nThere's something wrong in my app.js.\n\n84\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.263\nWell, I have the ;, I have the .log,\nand, it's fairly simple,\n\n85\n00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:14.555\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n86\n00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:17.645\nAnd it's made worse whenever you just\nstart coding and coding and coding and\n\n87\n00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:19.923\nyou don't test often and\nmake sure that it's wired up.\n\n88\n00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:23.770\nAnd then they'll go,\nwell is it on the page?\n\n89\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.109\nYeah, it's on the page and\nthey'll look by that really soon,\n\n90\n00:05:29.109 --> 00:05:32.649\nbut notice this should be src for source.\n\n91\n00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:35.762\nThis is a really hard thing to\ntrack down if, for instance,\n\n92\n00:05:35.762 --> 00:05:40.020\nyou call someone over and ask for help,\nwhich you should if you're kinda stuck.\n\n93\n00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.585\nI've had people say,\nI don't know why this isn't working.\n\n94\n00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:47.430\n&gt;&gt; Well our brain kinda like sees it\nas correct, even though it's incorrect.\n\n95\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, it's kind of like\nwhen you read your own papers or\n\n96\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.890\nyour own writing, you're like,\nyeah that sounds great.\n\n97\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.060\nSomeone else reads it out loud to you,\n\n98\n00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.930\nthat sounds bad,\nlike that's what you wrote.\n\n99\n00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.637\nCuz our brains will say this\nis what it's supposed to be.\n\n100\n00:05:59.637 --> 00:06:03.342\n&gt;&gt; You ever see those sentences where you\ncan read them even though only the first\n\n101\n00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:05.680\nand last letter actually\nmake sense [INAUDIBLE].\n\n102\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.750\nBut you can actually read\nthe sentences and see everything.\n\n103\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.756\nEven though it's not\ncorrect spelling at all.\n\n104\n00:06:09.756 --> 00:06:10.908\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:11.498\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n106\n00:06:11.498 --> 00:06:13.340\nso, we have to be careful with our minds,\nand\n\n107\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.800\nsince this is text based,\nwe have to very careful about details.\n\n108\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.768\nNow, if we always check\nto make sure our CSS and\n\n109\n00:06:21.768 --> 00:06:27.100\nour 'app.js' are on the page and working\nbefore we worry about anything else.\n\n110\n00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.530\nWe can find this error\nsignificantly easier.\n\n111\n00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.700\nThen we would if,\nI just built the whole application.\n\n112\n00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.780\nLet me refresh,\ndoesn't work, that's weird.\n\n113\n00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.220\nAnd then you start putting in\nconsole.logs and they don't work,\n\n114\n00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.680\nand you get really frustrated.\n\n115\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.630\nAnd I've had people tell me\nthey've spent three, four,\n\n116\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.820\nfive hours trying to hunt\nsomething like this down.\n\n117\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.150\nAnd, even for me, there's been\ntimes where, hey, I need your help.\n\n118\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.350\nI go and look, I don't know, and\nit's taken me about 20, 30 minutes.\n\n119\n00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.510\nSo be very, very careful there,\nthat was kind of a weird aside.\n\n120\n00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.180\nBut a very important one to\nalleviate some frustration, and\n\n121\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.500\nnotice we now have working.\n\n122\n00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.410\nSo, immediately, what I'm gonna do,\nis remove this really intense color.\n\n123\n00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.690\n&gt;&gt; The giant purple nightmare?\n\n124\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] Giant purple nightmare.\n\n125\n00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:19.394\n[SOUND] And\nthen let's get our layout started.\n\n126\n00:07:19.394 --> 00:07:23.123\nWhat we're gonna do is, we're gonna\nworry about one key of a piano, and\n\n127\n00:07:23.123 --> 00:07:24.480\nkind of get that working.\n\n128\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.210\nAnd then extend that beyond to other keys.\n\n129\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:36.790\nSo, as always, we need div with an app,\nand within that,\n\n130\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:42.040\nI want the case within this application,\nright?\n\n131\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.472\nThe outside of the piano,\n\n132\n00:07:43.472 --> 00:07:46.930\nyou can think of it more as\na keyboard like an electronic panel.\n\n133\n00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.516\nI wanna have case, and then within that,\n\n134\n00:07:50.516 --> 00:07:55.233\nI’m gonna have divs that\nrepresent keys with labels.\n\n135\n00:07:55.233 --> 00:08:00.641\nSo, I need a div with a key And\nthen div with a key-label,\n\n136\n00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:05.622\nand within that key I'm\ngoing to just say capital A.\n\n137\n00:08:05.622 --> 00:08:10.550\nAnd that's because this key is going\nto map to capital A on the keyboard.\n\n138\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.730\nNow in this one, we're always going\nto have capital letters, so when you\n\n139\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.460\nplay your piano you have to have caps lock\non or hold shift, so keep that in mind.\n\n140\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.010\nLower case a, capital A, are different,\nand that's why I put the labels on here.\n\n141\n00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.370\nAnd then also, well,\nwhen you hit a key on a piano,\n\n142\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.420\nyou need the audio, well,\nhow do you make audio?\n\n143\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.000\nThere are ways to generate\naudio tones using JavaScript,\n\n144\n00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.445\njust pure JavaScript,\nthey are not trivial in nature.\n\n145\n00:08:40.445 --> 00:08:44.894\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; By the way, what would be better is if\n\n146\n00:08:44.894 --> 00:08:51.040\nwe just had some WAV files or MP3 files\ninside of here so we could use those?\n\n147\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.980\nDefinitely go and find the,\nI'm gonna leave this open for\n\n148\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.404\nyou to go find the sound right.\n\n149\n00:08:55.404 --> 00:09:00.060\nYou could even make the, remember those\nold toys where you hit the cow says moo?\n\n150\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.235\nYou could go find things and\nmap those as well.\n\n151\n00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:07.023\nBut I have sounds already\nkind of div it out, and\n\n152\n00:09:07.023 --> 00:09:11.287\nI'm just gonna drag that\nfolder into my project, and\n\n153\n00:09:11.287 --> 00:09:17.750\nwithin I have a.wave which is the node a,\nb wave which is node b so on and so forth.\n\n154\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.060\nAnd within that I'm going to say audio,\nand\n\n155\n00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.946\nnotice it has an src and\nI'm gonna say sounds/a.wav, and\n\n156\n00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:33.040\nI had to put sound/\nbecause from index.html,\n\n157\n00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.190\nI have to go inside the sounds\nfolder to find the A key, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.890\nSo, I have our initial key setup here,\nLet's go see what it looks like.\n\n159\n00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:49.690\nI have the letter A on the page,\nlooks nothing like a piano.\n\n160\n00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.450\nSo let's take a quick aside and\ndo a little bit of styling so\n\n161\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.160\nwe can actually see how\nthis is gonna play out.\n\n162\n00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.590\nSo within my main.css,\nI'm gonna style the app.\n\n163\n00:10:07.118 --> 00:10:14.137\nAnd that's gonna be display: flex,\njustify-content: center,\n\n164\n00:10:14.137 --> 00:10:19.710\nand align-items: center,\nand height of 600px.\n\n165\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.800\nAnd then within the that, the case is\ngoing to be the full width of its parent,\n\n166\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.200\nhowever big that is, so 100%,\nthe height is going to be 400 pixels.\n\n167\n00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.020\nAnd I'm using pixels here,\njust because it made sense\n\n168\n00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.510\nwhen I constructed this to reason about,\nI didn't have to do conversions.\n\n169\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.590\nYou could go back and change these to\nem's, or rems, which are relative units,\n\n170\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.000\nyou should do that after things\nare all kind of tidied up.\n\n171\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.970\nAnd then we're gonna make that black,\nand then the display for\n\n172\n00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.631\nthis is also going to be flex,\nalign-items center.\n\n173\n00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:04.660\nJustify-content also center,\n\n174\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.520\nso there's our case,\nand then we need a key.\n\n175\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.900\nSo if we look back at our index.html,\nwe have a class of key, so we're\n\n176\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.915\ngonna use the white keys on the piano,\nand so I'm gonna make a key.\n\n177\n00:11:21.565 --> 00:11:25.365\nAnd let me add some comments down here,\n\n178\n00:11:25.365 --> 00:11:28.555\nso we don't have overscroll, so\nwithin that key, what do we want?\n\n179\n00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:34.456\nWe want a width of 100 pixels, and\nour key is gonna be 100 pixels wide.\n\n180\n00:11:34.456 --> 00:11:40.136\nOur height, is gonna be 400 pixels, so\nessentially the height of this element,\n\n181\n00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:43.020\nand you may have to\ntweak that a little bit.\n\n182\n00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.960\nAnd then,\nthis display is also gonna be flex,\n\n183\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.320\nwhich means I'm gonna center\nthat label within it.\n\n184\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.746\nAnd line items, center, nope, I lied.\n\n185\n00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:03.456\nAlign-items: flex-end and\n\n186\n00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:09.111\nalign-self so\naligning the key itself to flex-end,\n\n187\n00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:16.710\nand finally background-color is white.\n\n188\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:21.090\nBorder of one pixel solid, light grey,\n\n189\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.480\nand then we'll come back and\nadd some nice little pieces there.\n\n190\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.978\nI have to keep all these in order, this is\na lot of styling Daniel, a lot of styling.\n\n191\n00:12:33.978 --> 00:12:34.536\n&gt;&gt; You're.\n\n192\n00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:36.470\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; How much you love to style.\n\n193\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:42.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit is a love hate relationship sometimes.\n\n194\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.860\n&gt;&gt; You love to hate it?\n\n195\n00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.170\nSo my key label, What do I want?\n\n196\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:51.041\nI want a border radius, of 100%,\nthat's going to make it a circle,\n\n197\n00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:56.239\nthat dive is going to become\na circle instead of a box.\n\n198\n00:12:56.239 --> 00:12:57.325\nDon't do that.\n\n199\n00:12:57.325 --> 00:13:03.179\nBackground-color, rgba(200,\n\n200\n00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:07.434\n200, 200, 0.3)\n\n201\n00:13:07.434 --> 00:13:12.233\nkinda a semi transparent gray.\n\n202\n00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:16.120\nAnd then the color is gonna be rgba.\n\n203\n00:13:18.467 --> 00:13:24.100\nOf 30, 30, 30, and\nI'm going to not put in the transparency.\n\n204\n00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.620\nSo that'll be full opacity,\nit'll be fully opaque.\n\n205\n00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:35.036\nAnd then width, width 50 pixels, height,\n\n206\n00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:40.120\n50 pixels display, and this is so\n\n207\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:45.154\nI can have text content centered,\nalign itself,\n\n208\n00:13:45.154 --> 00:13:48.427\ncenter, align items.\n\n209\n00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:55.401\nCenter, align content.\n\n210\n00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:02.689\nCenter and then finally,\njustify-content, center.\n\n211\n00:14:02.689 --> 00:14:07.090\n&gt;&gt; Now this a little a bit of [INAUDIBLE],\nthis is overdone a little bit.\n\n212\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:11.070\nBut admittedly so,\nI had some weird issues where my\n\n213\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.060\ntext would do weird things if\nI didn't set all of these.\n\n214\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.180\nSo I'm open to hearing some ideas.\n\n215\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.920\n&gt;&gt; It is good practice at the very least.\n\n216\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it is good, I'm centering\neverything, everything is centered.\n\n217\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:28.190\nSo we should be good,\nlet's go see what it looks like now.\n\n218\n00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:33.580\nRefresh, and\nnow I have this semi-centered,\n\n219\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.960\nso it looks like I might\nhave a whoopsy-daisy here.\n\n220\n00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.860\nBut we'll worry about that later,\nI'm just gonna leave that here, but\n\n221\n00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.570\nnow I have a single key on my piano,\nit's centered.\n\n222\n00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.160\nAs I add more keys, they'll kind of\nspread out as I have the styling set up.\n\n223\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.850\n&gt;&gt; Like you said, it's more important to\nget it functional first than it is to\n\n224\n00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.640\n&gt;&gt; Worry about the styling, and\n\n225\n00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.690\nmake sure it looks pretty.\n\n226\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's my thought process,\nit's not shared by everybody.\n\n227\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.660\nSo keep that in mind if you're\none of those that's like,\n\n228\n00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.910\nI want it to look good\nbefore if does anything.\n\n229\n00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.850\nThat's completely up to you, but\n\n230\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.850\nif it looks good and\nit doesn't do anything, I don't know.\n\n231\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.680\nIt would be hard for me to use it, so.\n\n232\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.000\n&gt;&gt; I have subjective opinion on that,\nI have bias, and mentally so.\n\n233\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.182\nNow that we've got through that styling,\nwhat do we want to do?\n\n234\n00:15:13.182 --> 00:15:16.720\nWe wanna grab a reference to these keys,\nand when I type the letter a,\n\n235\n00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.150\nI want to play.\n\n236\n00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:25.330\nSo we're gonna start by, as we always do,\nkind of getting our ideas flushed out.\n\n237\n00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:31.110\nDo I need any data or variables, well,\n\n238\n00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:36.000\nthis is one of the few projects where I\ndon't need additional data or variables at\n\n239\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.100\ncurrent time, as I'm starting, I don't\nneed to keep a kind of track like score or\n\n240\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.140\nthe number of guesses or anything\nlike that or the count or the time.\n\n241\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:51.201\nSo, I'm just going to\nkeep a note of none for\n\n242\n00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:56.401\nnow, do I need to grab\na reference to the DOM?\n\n243\n00:15:56.401 --> 00:16:03.413\nWell Yeah, I actually need the keys and\nI may need the audio element.\n\n244\n00:16:03.413 --> 00:16:07.148\nSo let's go, keys and\n\n245\n00:16:07.148 --> 00:16:16.036\nthen document.querySelector of ('.keys').\n\n246\n00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:20.407\nSo, we have one key here.\n\n247\n00:16:20.407 --> 00:16:23.830\nAnd, but why did I name this plural?\n\n248\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.890\nWell, really I know that I'm gonna\nhave multiple keys in the future.\n\n249\n00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.711\nI'm gonna worry about the one for now.\n\n250\n00:16:28.711 --> 00:16:31.190\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nget those as a collection.\n\n251\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.960\nSo I'm gonna have a collection\nthat is just one thing.\n\n252\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.330\nSo let's console.log and\nsee what keys represents.\n\n253\n00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.900\nKeep going the wrong way.\n\n254\n00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.494\nAnd if I pull this back over,\nnotice I have the square brackets.\n\n255\n00:16:44.494 --> 00:16:46.687\nLooks like an array, but\nit's in fact a node list,\n\n256\n00:16:46.687 --> 00:16:50.010\nwe have to keep in mind those\nare a little bit different than arrays.\n\n257\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.990\nI don't have quite all of the methods\nthat we may be used to for a collection.\n\n258\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.190\nSo I have those keys.\n\n259\n00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.230\nNow what do I need to do.\n\n260\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.190\nWell I should probably go ahead and\ncache the app.\n\n261\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.450\nYou never know when I'm gonna need that.\n\n262\n00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:03.940\nAnd I can always come back and\nremove that.\n\n263\n00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:10.372\nSo querySelector and the app.\n\n264\n00:17:10.372 --> 00:17:17.483\nAnd well, I think that's all of\nthe caching of the DOM that I need.\n\n265\n00:17:17.483 --> 00:17:19.030\nWhat about Add Event Listeners?\n\n266\n00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.771\nWell what do I want to\nadd an even listener to?\n\n267\n00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:31.214\nFor each one of the keys, when I click,\n\n268\n00:17:31.214 --> 00:17:36.250\ndo I want to have the keys?\n\n269\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.040\nOr do I want to listen to something else?\n\n270\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.780\nWell in this case, we're gonna go back and\nif I'm listening for key press,\n\n271\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.110\nthe easiest way is to listen\non the window object.\n\n272\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.860\nWe will change this at a later time,\naddEventListener,\n\n273\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.970\nand I want to listen for keydown.\n\n274\n00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.460\nAnd what do I wanna do?\n\n275\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.380\nI wanna play a note, right?\n\n276\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.150\nSo if I hit A, I wanna play\na note associated with the A key.\n\n277\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.917\nAnd because I have that function,\nI should probably go ahead and\n\n278\n00:18:07.917 --> 00:18:09.951\nwrite that function, playNote.\n\n279\n00:18:09.951 --> 00:18:12.260\nAnd it's going to be given an event.\n\n280\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:18.830\nAnd we're gonna make sure that that's\nall wired up before we move forward.\n\n281\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.584\nSo if I refresh and I hit A.\n\n282\n00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:28.144\nOkay, so I have a keyboard event but\n\n283\n00:18:28.144 --> 00:18:32.102\nnotice I have the lowercase a.\n\n284\n00:18:32.102 --> 00:18:34.583\nThat's fine.\n\n285\n00:18:34.583 --> 00:18:36.018\nB, not over here.\n\n286\n00:18:36.018 --> 00:18:37.350\nIt has to be in the window.\n\n287\n00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.925\nSo I have all these keyboard events.\n\n288\n00:18:39.925 --> 00:18:41.460\nBut now I've run into a problem.\n\n289\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.714\nHow am I going to figure out\nwhat note I'm going to play?\n\n290\n00:18:51.555 --> 00:18:54.330\nIf we look through,\nnotice that A has a key code.\n\n291\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.390\nSo a key code is actually\nmapped to each one of the keys,\n\n292\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.410\nthey're assigned a numerical\nvalue when you type them.\n\n293\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.330\nI could look at key, but I'm actually\ngoing to use the key code because\n\n294\n00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.710\nI'm gonna do a little bit of magic so\nto speak.\n\n295\n00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.370\nBecause what I want to happen is,\nwhen I hit the a, I want this a key\n\n296\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:20.390\nto highlight to let you know that's\nthe key that you're playing, but\n\n297\n00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:25.230\nI also want to play audio\nassociated with that key.\n\n298\n00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.020\nSo how would I go about doing that?\n\n299\n00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:33.755\nWell, hm, let's grab the key code and\n\n300\n00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:39.181\nI think I can use some destructuring here.\n\n301\n00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:43.511\nThis is one of those new ES6 features, so\nI can pull that out of the object without\n\n302\n00:19:43.511 --> 00:19:46.777\nsaying dot, so then I can pull\nout a bunch of them at one time.\n\n303\n00:19:46.777 --> 00:19:51.650\nSo I have the key code,\nnow I need to grab the audio element,\n\n304\n00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.562\nand the actual key that\nI'm interacting with.\n\n305\n00:19:59.255 --> 00:20:02.316\nThis is one of those times\nwhere it maybe advantageous\n\n306\n00:20:02.316 --> 00:20:04.160\nto add custom HTML attributes.\n\n307\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:11.520\nTo our application so I can now have some\nideas, some bread crumbs to follow and\n\n308\n00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.299\nwe can do that by adding\ndata- in front of them.\n\n309\n00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:19.968\nIf I put data- then I can add\nany attributes I want and\n\n310\n00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:24.320\nto put it in perspective\nif I do data-keycode and\n\n311\n00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.161\nthis is the A,\nI wanna map this to the A key.\n\n312\n00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:34.514\nSo this key as a whole is\ngoing to be mapped to 65.\n\n313\n00:20:34.514 --> 00:20:38.330\nSo data-keycode is 65.\n\n314\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:43.486\nLikewise, when I tap A,\nI want to play the A note.\n\n315\n00:20:43.486 --> 00:20:46.988\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n316\n00:20:46.988 --> 00:20:51.943\nData-key, or I could even say node but\nI'm keeping these so\n\n317\n00:20:51.943 --> 00:20:56.130\nI know they're paired together,\nof 65 as well.\n\n318\n00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:02.015\nSo I now have this collection,\nthis pairing between the key.\n\n319\n00:21:02.015 --> 00:21:04.683\nThat I'm going to highlight and\nshow that I'm playing and\n\n320\n00:21:04.683 --> 00:21:06.269\nthe audio that should be playing.\n\n321\n00:21:07.745 --> 00:21:13.378\nSo all right, let's see if we\ncan use that to our advantage.\n\n322\n00:21:13.378 --> 00:21:16.080\nI need to grab this key and\nI need to grab this key.\n\n323\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.400\nEvery time I hit a key down.\n\n324\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.730\nOkay, so what is our element?\n\n325\n00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.440\nThis is one of the few times where\nit's really hard for me to I don't\n\n326\n00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.900\nknow what I'm actually going\nto need until I press the key.\n\n327\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.690\nSo I have to do a dom search dynamically.\n\n328\n00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.170\nI can't cache this very easily.\n\n329\n00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.550\nSo document.querySelector, and\n\n330\n00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:44.080\nI'm gonna use a more complex query\nto select that particular key.\n\n331\n00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.940\nAnd as a result I'm wanna use bactiks\nbecause I need this key code for\n\n332\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.560\nthis selection process.\n\n333\n00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.550\nI want something that\nhas the class of key and\n\n334\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:57.380\nif I put square brackets i can look for\nattributes like source, href,\n\n335\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:03.580\nstyle and in this case, data, data-.\n\n336\n00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.440\nSo, if I'm looking for data-keycode=,\nand then we have to put\n\n337\n00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.910\nquotes, because if you notice\nin Index.HTML, this is a string.\n\n338\n00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.230\nSo, I have to keep that a string inside,\nI have to follow that format.\n\n339\n00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.604\nAnd then what do I want, I want,\n\n340\n00:22:24.604 --> 00:22:29.311\nkeycode, keycode, there we go.\n\n341\n00:22:29.311 --> 00:22:35.880\nSo let's see if that actually gives\nme the element that I'm expecting.\n\n342\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:44.340\nSo refresh backspace here, so\nI'm gonna, I hit E, nothing.\n\n343\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:51.583\nD, nothing if I hit A, hey I have the div\nthat's associated with the A keycode.\n\n344\n00:22:51.583 --> 00:22:57.477\nOkay, now I've added some attributes to my\nHTML that have helped me query the DOM for\n\n345\n00:22:57.477 --> 00:22:59.510\nthe thing I need.\n\n346\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.100\nAnd if you put data dash, you can\nput any amounts of attributes here.\n\n347\n00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:07.070\nWith that said, keep in mind,\ndont store sensitive information.\n\n348\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.185\nI've seen a couple of places that,\npassword.\n\n349\n00:23:10.185 --> 00:23:13.153\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're are like well this users\n\n350\n00:23:13.153 --> 00:23:18.395\npassword or maybe its a hidden token that\nyou don't want to be easily inspectable.\n\n351\n00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:21.966\nDon't do things that may\nbe security concerns but,\n\n352\n00:23:21.966 --> 00:23:25.430\nthis is a very valid thing you can do,\nokay.\n\n353\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:26.580\nSo, we can use that to select.\n\n354\n00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.470\nWhat else do we need?\n\n355\n00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.414\nWe actually need\nthe associated audio file.\n\n356\n00:23:30.414 --> 00:23:35.637\nOkay, with that said, let's say,\n\n357\n00:23:35.637 --> 00:23:41.880\nconst audio = document.querySelector.\n\n358\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.650\nAnd I'm counting on these being unique,\nright?\n\n359\n00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.850\nSo there's kind of an assumption there,\nthese are unique.\n\n360\n00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:52.950\nAnd I'm looking for the audio element,\nthat has the data-key.\n\n361\n00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.506\nAnd we need to make\nthese back ticks because\n\n362\n00:23:55.506 --> 00:23:56.723\notherwise-\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna work.\n\n363\n00:23:56.723 --> 00:24:00.074\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be a rough day.\n\n364\n00:24:00.074 --> 00:24:04.395\nAgain, these new EAS 6 features,\nthey are handy from time to time.\n\n365\n00:24:04.395 --> 00:24:07.460\nSo let me put a comment down here so\nwe can.\n\n366\n00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.580\nI'm staring down the bottom of my screen.\n\n367\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:17.140\nAnd I want the data-key to be\nequal to also the keyCode, right?\n\n368\n00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.537\nSo now I have this kind\nof pairing from the DOM.\n\n369\n00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.860\nFor very large applications this may not\nbe practical, just keep that in mind.\n\n370\n00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.122\nBut for these smaller applications,\nsmaller widgets,\n\n371\n00:24:30.122 --> 00:24:32.705\nI'm getting exactly what I want.\n\n372\n00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:38.000\nAnd let's console.log(audio), okay?\n\n373\n00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.898\nSo if I refresh, and I say E,\nsomething went wrong.\n\n374\n00:24:44.898 --> 00:24:48.304\nIt's no good, so what happened?\n\n375\n00:24:48.304 --> 00:24:54.960\nDocument': 'audio[data-key\nis not a valid selector.\n\n376\n00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.290\nHm, what did I do?\n\n377\n00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:01.214\nWell, if you compare these two,\ndata-keycode.\n\n378\n00:25:01.214 --> 00:25:04.320\nThere're some quotes.\n\n379\n00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.470\nThere are no quotes here.\n\n380\n00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.770\nAnd so it's looking for a number,\nwhen in fact it should be string.\n\n381\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.633\nSo be very careful about that.\n\n382\n00:25:13.633 --> 00:25:19.470\nBut at least it threw an explicit error\ninstead of just going, it doesn't work.\n\n383\n00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.920\nSo that's nice,\nlet's go see if it works now.\n\n384\n00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:27.260\nSo if I hit E, null, D, null,\nA, hey, there's the audio.\n\n385\n00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:32.290\nSo as you can see, when you hit keys\nthat don't correspond to audio, well,\n\n386\n00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.040\nI like to test that.\n\n387\n00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.220\nAnd, well, let's just see what happens if\nI try to play audio, and I hit those keys.\n\n388\n00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.346\nSo let's hop back over,\nremove this console.log(audio);.\n\n389\n00:25:44.346 --> 00:25:48.940\nAnd say audio.play( );, and refresh.\n\n390\n00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.745\nLet's see if our sound plays.\n\n391\n00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:54.790\n[SOUND] And it does,\nnotice that it's kind of a longer note.\n\n392\n00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.510\nBut if I hit E, right,\nthat's not associated with anything.\n\n393\n00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:04.250\nSo audio is undefined, it's null, and\n.play isn't meaningful in any context.\n\n394\n00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.180\nSo how do we guard against that?\n\n395\n00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.240\nWell, let's remove that.\n\n396\n00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.580\nAnd say, if there is not audio, right?\n\n397\n00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.130\nIf there's not audio associated with that,\nthen I'm going to return.\n\n398\n00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.100\nAnd we will actually do a refractor,\n\n399\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.050\nbecause I don't certainly like\ndoing this return all the time.\n\n400\n00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.840\nThere is a way to not use a return\nto skip out on the function early.\n\n401\n00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.960\nBut for now I think this is a good guard.\n\n402\n00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.610\nSo let see if we can keep it from erroring\nout, cuz it's never good to error out.\n\n403\n00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.960\nSo if I refresh and I hit E,\nI'm hitting on the keyboard.\n\n404\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.976\nAnd it looks like I have, wait for it.\n\n405\n00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:45.990\nYeah, there, Justin,\nyou've gotta put the playback.\n\n406\n00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.170\nThat's important, don't overlook that.\n\n407\n00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.310\nSo everything's good,\n[SOUND] but then A still works.\n\n408\n00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:56.116\nWe're starting to get this,\nwe've got the beginnings of a piano.\n\n409\n00:26:56.116 --> 00:26:59.790\nBut you know, Daniel, there's a few\nother things that I need to get done.\n\n410\n00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.993\nI just don't think we have\ntime in this episode.\n\n411\n00:27:01.993 --> 00:27:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think that, seeing how\nlong it took us to get this far, that\n\n412\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.770\nwe're gonna be able to finish it up in the\nnext 17 seconds that we have on the clock.\n\n413\n00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.170\nSo, looks like we're\nheaded down the path for\n\n414\n00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:15.690\nanother part two, as we typically do in\nthese Let's Build It series parts [LAUGH].\n\n415\n00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.490\nSo that being said,\nlet's go ahead and close down.\n\n416\n00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.080\nThanks Justin, for\ngetting us to where we're at.\n\n417\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.470\nThank you guys for watching us,\nsigning off for ITProTV.\n\n418\n00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.470\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n419\n00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison,\nand we'll see you next time.\n\n420\n00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:33.960\n[MUSIC]\n\n421\n00:27:33.960 -->

00:00:18.200\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.950\nin today’s episode we are back\nwith intro to web developments.\n\n7\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.860\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio\nyet again to continue building our cool\n\n8\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.050\nlittle piano web app is our good friend,\nMr. Justin Dennison.\n\n9\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.090\nJustin, welcome back, my man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.380\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, how are you, Daniel?\n\n11\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.720\n&gt;&gt;

my hand.\n\n14\n00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.150\n&gt;&gt; You doing good?\n\n15\n00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.669\nI'm doing fine.\n\n16\n00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:42.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\n\n17\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.730\nSo, luckily we don't\nhave to worry about that.\n\n18\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.990\nBut we did run into some problems\non our piano web app in part one.\n\n19\n00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.440\nIf you haven't checked that out,\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n20\n00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.060\nWe need to further expand this.\n\n21\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.550\nWe got one key that plays one note.\n\n22\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.800\nAnd I don't know about you,\nbut that doesn't make a piano.\n\n23\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.320\nKeep in mind we're not\nmaking a full scale piano.\n\n24\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.940\nSo we have to keep that kind of an issue.\n\n25\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.540\nSo let's go ahead and\nhop back in to our browser and editor so\n\n26\n00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.250\nwe can see where we stand.\n\n27\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.220\nSo if we stand here [SOUND] All right,\nnote plays, beautiful, it's beautiful.\n\n28\n00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.510\nAnd but I have one A key,\nall right, I can play one note.\n\n29\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.430\nAnd right now, all that's doing\nis it's playing if there's audio,\n\n30\n00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.220\notherwise it's just not doing anything.\n\n31\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.170\nSo there's a little more to work on here.\n\n32\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.350\nAnd I think the best thing is\nto start by adding those keys.\n\n33\n00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.840\nSo I'm gonna leverage my editor here and\ngo duplicate,\n\n34\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.060\nduplicate, duplicate,\nduplicate, duplicate.\n\n35\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.470\nThat might be enough.\n\n36\n00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.430\nAnd now I just have to\nchange a little bit.\n\n37\n00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.000\nSo from A I'm going to go S,\nand what is the key code here?\n\n38\n00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.180\nI have these written down.\n\n39\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.920\nI'll show you, you could always print out\nthe events and then just map those, but\n\n40\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.430\nI have those written down, so\nI can make this expeditious in nature.\n\n41\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.870\nAnd then D is 68, let's go ahead and\nchange that label.\n\n42\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.170\nAnd then what do we have for F?\n\n43\n00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.970\nThat is 70?\n\n44\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.030\nI don't know who came up\nwith these key codes.\n\n45\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.990\nI'm sure there's a reason for\nwhy the numbers are what they are.\n\n46\n00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.050\nAnd then I actually hopped over to\nh just because I didn't want to\n\n47\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.790\nbe running over into the semicolon\njust to keep it letters.\n\n48\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.710\nSo h is 72.\n\n49\n00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.860\nAnd then j is 74.\n\n50\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.460\nAnd then I need one more.\n\n51\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.960\nSo if you don't know what I'm doing here,\nas I highlight this block,\n\n52\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.810\nif I hold shift command, and d or\n\n53\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.005\nshift control d on Windows machines, it\nwill duplicate that entire block of code.\n\n54\n00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:55.740\n[NOISE] Boom, there we go.\n\n55\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.422\nSo what do I need after j?\n\n56\n00:02:57.422 --> 00:02:59.534\nAnd that is k.\n\n57\n00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.409\nAnd that is keycode 75.\n\n58\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.850\nSo likewise I need to\nduplicate the audio tags.\n\n59\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.680\nSo I have a total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n60\n00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.720\nSo I need six more of these.\n\n61\n00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.720\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n62\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.680\nAnd I'm gonna have this be a,\nb, c, d, e, and\n\n63\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.800\ng, and those all correspond to\nWAV files in my sound folder.\n\n64\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.950\nThose are whole notes, no halves,\nflats, anything of that nature.\n\n65\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.260\nSharps, halves, sharps.\n\n66\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.795\nNo sharps or flats, there we go.\n\n67\n00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:42.820\nAnd then correspondingly I need to get 83,\n58, 70, 72, 74.\n\n68\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.180\nSo 83, 68, 70, 72.\n\n69\n00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:54.864\n74 and 75.\n\n70\n00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.673\nBut now that we have the setup we made\nit for one key, we might get lucky and\n\n71\n00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:02.857\nthese just work.\n\n72\n00:04:02.857 --> 00:04:05.329\nSo let's go try it out here.\n\n73\n00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:11.062\n[MUSIC]\n\n74\n00:04:11.062 --> 00:04:12.563\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:14.660\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what, ship that.\n\n76\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.000\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nThis is done.\n\n77\n00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.120\n&gt;&gt; Yup, it's done.\n\n78\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.340\nSo now I have the keys, right?\n\n79\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.840\nBut there's a couple of things.\n\n80\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.720\nNumber one,\nI don't know what key I'm playing.\n\n81\n00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.302\nNumber two,\nI'm just gonna hit a really quickly.\n\n82\n00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:32.886\n[SOUND] So unlike a piano, if I let\noff the key and hit it very quickly,\n\n83\n00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:34.749\nI can't change the tempo.\n\n84\n00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:37.350\nSo we need to remedy\na couple of things here.\n\n85\n00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.440\nSo first off I need to\nremedy that I can play.\n\n86\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.660\nIf I hit A a bunch of times,\nit will start over.\n\n87\n00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.890\nAnd that's because in audio\nelements you have a duration.\n\n88\n00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.410\nRight?\n\n89\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.120\nIt lasts some amount of time.\n\n90\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.570\nAnd if it's still playing,\nit will not start over.\n\n91\n00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.710\nIt won't play again.\n\n92\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.240\nSo we're gonna remedy that.\n\n93\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.510\nAlso I need to know what key I'm pressing.\n\n94\n00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.450\nAnd we're gonna use a little bit of CSS\nand JavaScript combined to make that work.\n\n95\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.250\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n96\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.670\nworry about that current that playing and\nseeing how things are going.\n\n97\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.580\nSo if I actually console.logged\nthis audio element out.\n\n98\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.400\nAnd for now, I'm gonna turn off the sound,\njust so we can\n\n99\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.720\nsee this without worrying about\nsound playing everywhere.\n\n100\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.590\nSo if I refresh and I hit A,\nthere's that audio element but\n\n101\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.320\nit only shows me that Dom node.\n\n102\n00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.940\nI want a little more\ninformation about audio.\n\n103\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.520\nSo if I refresh, I change the DIR so\nI can pull those attributes apart.\n\n104\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.640\nAnd if I scroll down,\nnotice there's a current time.\n\n105\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.020\nCurrent time is where long the sound\nthe play has progressed to.\n\n106\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.730\nWell when it starts out if I refresh,\n\n107\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.450\nif it starts out, well I don't have any\nway to print it out, this starts at 0.\n\n108\n00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.950\nI want it to go back to\n0 if I press it again.\n\n109\n00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.030\nSo any time I wanna play the audio,\n\n110\n00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.249\nwell I wanna say audio.currentTime = 0.\n\n111\n00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.223\nAnd if I refresh, and\n\n112\n00:06:15.223 --> 00:06:20.189\nlet's turn back on our sound here.\n\n113\n00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.979\n[MUSIC]\n\n114\n00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.189\nSo now I have the ability\nto quickly hit notes and\n\n115\n00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:28.210\nchange the tempo by how quickly\nI'm typing on my keyboard.\n\n116\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.290\nSo we've solved one problem.\n\n117\n00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.870\nNow a second problem is I don't know\nwhat keys I'm gonna need, right?\n\n118\n00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.270\nI have labels but if I hit s, well it's b,\n\n119\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.590\nbut I'm not real sure that I'm\nhitting s or what's still playing.\n\n120\n00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.100\nSo we need to combine that with, and\nyou'll notice we have this element\n\n121\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.950\nthat should be a hint that we're\ngonna use that in some capacity.\n\n122\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.260\nWell, what do I wanna do?\n\n123\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.710\nI want to add a class that will\nchange the outline a little bit.\n\n124\n00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.070\nRight, it is currently active,\nit is currently playing.\n\n125\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.920\nSo let's go add that class, and\nit's not gonna be added by default but\n\n126\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.850\nit is going to be added,\nkind of at runtime.\n\n127\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.910\nSo, okay, playing.\n\n128\n00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.940\nWhat do we have for playing?\n\n129\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.320\nI'm gonna say the class playing.\n\n130\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.600\nAnd all it's gonna be is a border\nof three pixels solid yellow.\n\n131\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.500\nNow yellow is not something that\nwould be good to splash everywhere.\n\n132\n00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.830\nBut for highlighting, right,\nit kinda jumps out at you.\n\n133\n00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.420\nAnd if this works out, we should be good.\n\n134\n00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.410\nBut as it stands, playing as my\nCSS is not anywhere on my page.\n\n135\n00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.860\nSo how am I gonna fix that?\n\n136\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.220\nWell with this element,\nI can add the class dynamically and\n\n137\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.030\nwe'll get that highlighting.\n\n138\n00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.064\nSo let's see here, what do I wanna do?\n\n139\n00:07:53.064 --> 00:08:00.347\nI wanna say element.class, I don't know\nhow to get a hold of that class thing.\n\n140\n00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:01.573\nHow do I add a class?\n\n141\n00:08:01.573 --> 00:08:06.468\nSo I'm gonna console.dir() Element and\nI'm gonna turn off\n\n142\n00:08:06.468 --> 00:08:12.530\nthe sound just temporarily,\nbecause we wanna see what the div is.\n\n143\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.373\nAnd look, there's a classList,\nand if we look at classList,\n\n144\n00:08:17.373 --> 00:08:19.140\nit has the class of key.\n\n145\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.550\nOkay, so we actually want to\nadd to the classList there.\n\n146\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.600\nAnd what ways can I do that?\n\n147\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.810\nIf I look at the prototype,\nthis __proto, there's an add.\n\n148\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:35.050\nWhoop, and\nI jumped down here way at the bottom.\n\n149\n00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:41.050\nThere we go, there's an add method,\na remove method.\n\n150\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.310\nThese two methods are for adding and\nremoving classes to the list,\n\n151\n00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.580\nwhich will dynamically kind\nof update the classes and\n\n152\n00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.320\nstyling therefore based on\nclasses of the DOM element.\n\n153\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.239\nSo let's first just worry about\nadding the class dynamically,\n\n154\n00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:01.207\nso element.classList.add.\n\n155\n00:09:03.578 --> 00:09:06.580\nAnd what class do we want to add, play.\n\n156\n00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.730\nSo let's see how that works out for us.\n\n157\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:17.421\nSo I refresh, and notice it does\nhighlight very subtly, but it's staying.\n\n158\n00:09:17.421 --> 00:09:22.368\nAnd also, it would almost be nice if it\nwould kind of instead of just [SOUND],\n\n159\n00:09:22.368 --> 00:09:25.360\nin your face,\nif it kind of faded in, right?\n\n160\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.157\nIt transitioned in.\n\n161\n00:09:28.157 --> 00:09:30.270\n&gt;&gt; So you get nothing for\nfree with this programming stuff, do you?\n\n162\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you get nothing for free,\nso how are we gonna do that?\n\n163\n00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.220\nWell, what we're actually gonna do is\ncome back and change the key class\n\n164\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.740\nusing a little bit of CSS,\nusing some CSS animation magic.\n\n165\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.230\nAnd we're gonna add to the key\nclass a transition property.\n\n166\n00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.076\nAnd we want to listen for\nall transitions, and\n\n167\n00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:58.495\nthe transitions are going\nto take 0.7 seconds, right?\n\n168\n00:09:58.495 --> 00:10:02.274\nThey're gonna take not 0.7, but 0.07.\n\n169\n00:10:02.274 --> 00:10:06.465\nIt's just real tiny, and\nany time the state changes,\n\n170\n00:10:06.465 --> 00:10:10.330\nright, how it looks, anything that can be\nanimated will transition through that.\n\n171\n00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.157\nSo, let's see how that has changed.\n\n172\n00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:19.490\nAnd notice,\nlet me zoom in here just a little bit.\n\n173\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.930\nI'm gonna close out, and\nif I hit F, it's real subtle.\n\n174\n00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.680\nOkay, so it just kinda fades in,\nand there's not quite a start.\n\n175\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.430\nNow you can play with these timings, and\n\n176\n00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.019\njust to show you, just to accentuate,\nI will change this to 0.7.\n\n177\n00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.740\nAnd notice, it comes in over 0.7 seconds.\n\n178\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.160\nBut I'm now left with\nevery time I hit A or S or\n\n179\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.770\nD, well, I can't remove the class,\nI need some way to do that.\n\n180\n00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.150\nNow we could say,\nset time out or set an interval.\n\n181\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.940\nOr just have a loop that runs\nall the time and checks and\n\n182\n00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.800\nremoves those if they're there.\n\n183\n00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.980\nBut getting the timing\nright on that is difficult.\n\n184\n00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.300\nSo what do we wanna do?\n\n185\n00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.580\nNotice we have the keys here,\nthere is an on transition end event,\n\n186\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:14.640\ntransition end is once this comes\nfully into playing state, it's active.\n\n187\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.150\nI can then run another function\nat the end of that event.\n\n188\n00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.710\nSo, let's see how this works out.\n\n189\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.089\nSo, I'm gonna say keys,\nand I need to do it for\n\n190\n00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:27.160\nall of the keys that are on the page.\n\n191\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.723\nSo for each key, I'm gonna say\n\n192\n00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:36.775\nkey.addEventListener to transitionend,\nokay?\n\n193\n00:11:36.775 --> 00:11:40.672\nSo how are we going to,\n\n194\n00:11:40.672 --> 00:11:45.084\nwe're gonna removePlaying.\n\n195\n00:11:45.084 --> 00:11:46.926\nSo, for each of the keys,\nI've added an EventListener,\n\n196\n00:11:46.926 --> 00:11:48.176\nI'm listening to the transitionend.\n\n197\n00:11:48.176 --> 00:11:51.590\nAnd this will break,\nunless I add removePlaying.\n\n198\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:00.430\nAnd that's gonna take the event,\njust to show you transitionend, or\n\n199\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:06.490\nexcuse me, not transitionend,\nI want to see the event, okay?\n\n200\n00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:11.712\nSo if I refresh, and I hit A, A, notice,\n\n201\n00:12:11.712 --> 00:12:15.160\nwow, I got a lot of output there.\n\n202\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.720\nAnd why is that?\n\n203\n00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.241\nBecause each one of the border bottom\nwidth, the border right width,\n\n204\n00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:25.926\nthe border left color, top color,\nthey are all transitioning at once.\n\n205\n00:12:25.926 --> 00:12:29.852\nSo, hm,\nI get a bunch of events really quickly for\n\n206\n00:12:29.852 --> 00:12:36.070\nthe A key as soon as that fully gets\napplied to all of the border sides.\n\n207\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.100\nOkay, but it is all a transitionend event.\n\n208\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.780\nHow would I know that I can listen\nto these transitions as events?\n\n209\n00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.990\nSo if we look up events in MDM, so\n\n210\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.880\nI can go to event reference and look,\nokay, resource events, network events,\n\n211\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.670\nfocus events, CSS animation events,\nCSS transition events.\n\n212\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.526\nCSS transition has actually started,\ntransition has completed,\n\n213\n00:13:03.526 --> 00:13:06.830\nit has begun running.\n\n214\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.810\nLet's look at what a CSS transition is.\n\n215\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.580\nNotice it says this is\nan experimental technology.\n\n216\n00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:18.000\nIf we scroll down,\nwe see that we're good in Chrome and\n\n217\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.250\nFirefox, and to some extent,\nparts of Internet Explorer.\n\n218\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.320\nBut do keep in mind, this may change.\n\n219\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.930\nSo this is only one way to do it.\n\n220\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:32.790\nBut it is a little cleaner way,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n221\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:37.230\nMileage may vary on this, but\nit is handy, it is handy.\n\n222\n00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.380\nSo what do we wanna do?\n\n223\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.369\nWhen we removePlaying, well,\nwe want the element, right, the target.\n\n224\n00:13:43.369 --> 00:13:44.996\nAnd we just wanna removePlaying,\n\n225\n00:13:44.996 --> 00:13:48.700\nwe wanna then take it back\noff after that 0.07 seconds.\n\n226\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.973\nAnd I need to make sure that\nI've changed this to 0.07,\n\n227\n00:13:51.973 --> 00:13:56.190\ncuz otherwise,\nthose will take a long time to transition.\n\n228\n00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:01.080\nSo let's say target, and I'm gonna use\ndestructuring, and what is the target?\n\n229\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.000\nWell, the target is the element that\nthe event kind of originated from,\n\n230\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.700\nthe event target.\n\n231\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.750\nAnd we're just gonna pull\nthat out of event, and\n\n232\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.810\nlet's console that log, the target.\n\n233\n00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.250\nSo if I refresh and\nI'm gonna hit the A key, and\n\n234\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.627\nnotice it is the A key that\nspawns all of these events.\n\n235\n00:14:22.627 --> 00:14:28.340\nOkay, well, hm,\nwhat do we wanna do at that point?\n\n236\n00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:36.638\nWe wanna say\ntarget.classList.remove(\"playing\") and\n\n237\n00:14:36.638 --> 00:14:38.050\nrefresh.\n\n238\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.937\nAnd now, if I turn the sound back on,\n\n239\n00:14:43.937 --> 00:14:46.147\n[MUSIC]\n\n240\n00:14:46.147 --> 00:14:47.603\nI never said I could play the piano.\n\n241\n00:14:47.603 --> 00:14:50.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's an important thing to remember.\n\n242\n00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.305\nNever said I could play the piano.\n\n243\n00:14:51.305 --> 00:14:55.790\n&gt;&gt; Now it's working as far as the yellow\nhighlighting is happening, but\n\n244\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.708\nit's doing it really quickly.\n\n245\n00:14:56.708 --> 00:14:59.994\nI noticed that when you pressed all the\nkeys, it was like as soon as you pressed\n\n246\n00:14:59.994 --> 00:15:02.844\nanother key, that was lighting up,\nand the other was going away.\n\n247\n00:15:02.844 --> 00:15:05.417\nAnd to me, it seems very unnatural,\n\n248\n00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:09.070\nalmost like it should fade\nout as you move through.\n\n249\n00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.721\n&gt;&gt; So part of that is, is I'm setting\nthe transition speed to a very,\n\n250\n00:15:12.721 --> 00:15:14.951\nvery small increment, so it's [SOUND].\n\n251\n00:15:14.951 --> 00:15:16.470\nIt still transitions.\n\n252\n00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:21.902\nLet's actually change that to 0.7 seconds,\nwhich is almost an entire second.\n\n253\n00:15:21.902 --> 00:15:25.160\nI'm gonna turn off the sound, just so\nwe don't have dootdootdoot in my face.\n\n254\n00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.267\nYou have to refresh, and\nnotice it kind of pulses, right?\n\n255\n00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.030\nSo you can tweak those timings\nusing the CSS property here and\n\n256\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.890\nget a good fit for you.\n\n257\n00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:43.771\nIf it's going too fast, then [CROSSTALK],\nif it's going too slow, bump it down.\n\n258\n00:15:43.771 --> 00:15:48.541\nThe general rule of thumb is,\ndon't make them really long, right?\n\n259\n00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:49.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] 17 seconds.\n\n260\n00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:52.051\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 17 seconds, and\n\n261\n00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:57.088\nif I refresh, It's going.\n\n262\n00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:58.055\n&gt;&gt; It's happening.\n\n263\n00:15:58.055 --> 00:15:59.478\n&gt;&gt; It's happening.\n&gt;&gt; It's transitioning.\n\n264\n00:15:59.478 --> 00:16:00.251\n&gt;&gt; It's transitioning.\n\n265\n00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.463\n[CROSSTALK] 17 seconds.\n\n266\n00:16:01.463 --> 00:16:03.410\n&gt;&gt; Over 17 seconds.\n\n267\n00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.708\nThat's not a good user experience,\nso don't do that.\n\n268\n00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:12.038\nSo I'm gonna set this back to 0.07s and\n\n269\n00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:15.535\nlet's kind of look back through.\n\n270\n00:16:15.535 --> 00:16:16.671\nWhat do we have here?\n\n271\n00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:19.392\nWhat if I hit E?\n\n272\n00:16:19.392 --> 00:16:22.634\nOkay, well, that's fine.\n\n273\n00:16:22.634 --> 00:16:24.496\nI'm good to go.\n\n274\n00:16:24.496 --> 00:16:30.734\nBut if I look, have to be careful.\n\n275\n00:16:30.734 --> 00:16:32.478\nLet's think this through.\n\n276\n00:16:32.478 --> 00:16:35.488\nI have the element, class list.\n\n277\n00:16:35.488 --> 00:16:39.191\nIf I hit E, do I have a key code?\n\n278\n00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:43.754\nYeah, class list will still be\nokay because the element is still,\n\n279\n00:16:43.754 --> 00:16:46.930\nI can still possibly get an element.\n\n280\n00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:52.160\nLet's make sure I'm not getting\nsome weird behavior here.\n\n281\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.490\nSo element and\nthen console.log(element.class list).\n\n282\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.710\nSo refresh and then A,\nokay there's what I expect, and\n\n283\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:10.020\nif I hit E, well,\nwhy is it not getting there?\n\n284\n00:17:11.205 --> 00:17:15.355\nCuz I kind of blocked against that\nright here with the audio element.\n\n285\n00:17:15.355 --> 00:17:19.779\nI'm saying if there is not an audio\nelement that also has this key code,\n\n286\n00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:24.518\nwhich the corresponding element tag\nwould have the key code, then return.\n\n287\n00:17:24.518 --> 00:17:28.029\nBut that's not immediately obvious and\nprobably a better thing would to be\n\n288\n00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:31.430\nexplicit about that,\neven though it's not necessary here.\n\n289\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:38.397\nSo if I remove this audio portion,\nyou can see we're good.\n\n290\n00:17:38.397 --> 00:17:41.590\n[SOUND] Cannot read\nproperly classlist of null.\n\n291\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.880\nSo that may crop up.\n\n292\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.280\nSo you should be explicit about\nthose things and as a result,\n\n293\n00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.900\nI'm going to add that explicitness,\njust to make sure\n\n294\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:58.400\nif there is not an element,\nthen I also want to return.\n\n295\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.340\nCuz maybe there's some edge\ncase that I haven't thought of,\n\n296\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:07.120\nwhere the audio will be available, but the\nelement that I'm trying to show as the key\n\n297\n00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.830\nwill not be available, and would cause\nan error, and maybe it'll just break.\n\n298\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:17.090\nSo I like being explicit over\nkinda just yeah, that's good.\n\n299\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.067\nSo we have our piano done.\n\n300\n00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:24.730\nOur piano is actually not as complex\nas I saw in our other projects, but\n\n301\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:29.580\nwe didn't learn some new things\nthat we haven't seen before.\n\n302\n00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.284\nRemind ourselves of some new syntax,\n\n303\n00:18:32.284 --> 00:18:37.352\nnew ways of creating the DOM that\nare dynamic, but also looking at how we\n\n304\n00:18:37.352 --> 00:18:43.200\ncan use events to manage some of this\ntiming between things happening, right?.\n\n305\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.184\nI transition, I play the music,\nI come back and it's all good.\n\n306\n00:18:48.184 --> 00:18:53.260\nNow, the last thing we wanna do is,\nwell, I need some clean up.\n\n307\n00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.380\nI need to refactor this.\n\n308\n00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.430\nI need to get this all cleaned up here.\n\n309\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.840\nAnd if I look, notice that it\nis tightly coupled to my html.\n\n310\n00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.610\nThere's no way that I can get around\nnot having a structure available piano.\n\n311\n00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.501\nI could rewrite this to where this\nis all dynamically generated.\n\n312\n00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:16.970\nI don't know if I would do that initially,\nbecause it might get a little wierd.\n\n313\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.110\nBut we are gonna do a quick refactor and\n\n314\n00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.730\nthen I think that'll bundle\nup our piano real nice.\n\n315\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.458\nSo let's say class piano.\n\n316\n00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:32.170\nWe're gonna use class this time\njust because I feel like it.\n\n317\n00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.350\nAnd then within that constructor,\nwhat do I want.\n\n318\n00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.910\nNot construction,\nthat is totally different.\n\n319\n00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:45.780\nSo the constructor, well, the element is\nsomething that needs top be passed in.\n\n320\n00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.660\nDo I need any additional\ninformation inside of here?\n\n321\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.645\nNot really, but you'll notice,\n\n322\n00:19:51.645 --> 00:19:54.935\nI'm searching the entire\ndocument in a bunch of places.\n\n323\n00:19:54.935 --> 00:19:56.630\nAnd I'm doing some other stuff here.\n\n324\n00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.688\nWell, gotta be careful there.\n\n325\n00:20:00.688 --> 00:20:02.460\nWe're gonna change that.\n\n326\n00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.062\nSo the constructor, this.el = el, and\n\n327\n00:20:07.062 --> 00:20:11.274\nthen I wanna say this.cache the DOM.\n\n328\n00:20:11.274 --> 00:20:13.384\nI don't know why it capitalizes that.\n\n329\n00:20:15.044 --> 00:20:20.163\nThis.addListener And\n\n330\n00:20:20.163 --> 00:20:25.619\nthis.render the first time, okay?\n\n331\n00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:26.700\nNow, do I need this render?\n\n332\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.434\nI'm just following the same,\nI don't have render anywhere in here.\n\n333\n00:20:31.434 --> 00:20:33.163\nSo I don't like the other places,\n\n334\n00:20:33.163 --> 00:20:37.630\nI don't need that render state cuz I'm\nnot dynamically generating anything.\n\n335\n00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:42.930\nIt's just associated with cacheDom and\naddEventListener.\n\n336\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.040\nAnd I've already had all\nof my dynamic content.\n\n337\n00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.970\nAnd I'm using CSS to make those changes.\n\n338\n00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.270\nSo I don't need render here, so\nthe pattern doesn't always work.\n\n339\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.780\nSometimes you have to make\nan appropriate decision.\n\n340\n00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.280\nDo I need this or not?\n\n341\n00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.470\nSo, what is cacheDom?\n\n342\n00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:03.930\nSo cacheDom, and don't put a comma there,\n\n343\n00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.740\nunlike objects, that'll wreck\nyour life and then addListeners.\n\n344\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.720\nOkay, in cache the Dom, what do I want?\n\n345\n00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.900\nI want the keys and\nthis app portion and then paste,\n\n346\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.790\nbut then app, well, I want that to be,\nmaybe I want 30 pianos on a page.\n\n347\n00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.650\nOr I just want it to be bundled up so\nI can tidily put this all together.\n\n348\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.320\nAnd this is not dependent\non a particular ID,\n\n349\n00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.574\njust on the structure within that ID,\nso this.el.\n\n350\n00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.520\nAnd that would come from this constructor.\n\n351\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:46.130\nAnd then also keys where the keys\nare going to be in the application so\n\n352\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:51.560\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nchange that to querySelector or\n\n353\n00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.960\nof the app withing the application\nnot the entire document.\n\n354\n00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.830\nSo we have those, and\nwe want to attach those to the class.\n\n355\n00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.987\nSo this dot, and boom.\n\n356\n00:22:02.987 --> 00:22:06.749\nAnd then I need to add a this here,\njust so\n\n357\n00:22:06.749 --> 00:22:10.870\neverything's nice and self referential.\n\n358\n00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.730\nAnd then add listeners.\n\n359\n00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.978\nWell, that window thing\nkind of bothers me.\n\n360\n00:22:15.978 --> 00:22:20.675\nWe're gonna get it to work, and\nthen we're gonna make some changes, so\n\n361\n00:22:20.675 --> 00:22:22.701\nthe listeners well, window.\n\n362\n00:22:22.701 --> 00:22:28.820\nI'm just gonna, here we go,\ncopy and paste.\n\n363\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.220\nAnd then for\nkeys I actually need this.keys and\n\n364\n00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.400\nI'm going to bring this down.\n\n365\n00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.560\nAnd then this will be this.removePlaying.\n\n366\n00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.440\nAnd this.play but\nnotice these are now inside of the,\n\n367\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.710\na class which will create an object.\n\n368\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:51.080\nSo, I need to bind the current context\nof this because this are event handlers.\n\n369\n00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.248\nYou've seen this several times in another\nprojects, definitely get back and\n\n370\n00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:54.970\ncheck those out.\n\n371\n00:22:54.970 --> 00:23:00.451\nTry to wrap your mind around that\n'cuz it can be a little tricky.\n\n372\n00:23:00.451 --> 00:23:08.211\nAnd then I need to add removePlaying and,\nplayNote.\n\n373\n00:23:08.211 --> 00:23:10.931\nOkay, that takes an event.\n\n374\n00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:16.204\nAnd playNote, Also takes an event.\n\n375\n00:23:17.781 --> 00:23:21.667\nSo I'm just gonna grab\nthe inner part of this.\n\n376\n00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:26.407\nCopy, And paste.\n\n377\n00:23:26.407 --> 00:23:28.917\nGotta make sure you put it\nin the right spot here.\n\n378\n00:23:28.917 --> 00:23:30.410\nAnd then target.\n\n379\n00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.930\nI actually don't need a this anywhere\nin here because I'm using the event to\n\n380\n00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.440\nfigure out what I need to interact with.\n\n381\n00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:41.650\nSo this is disjoint from this\nobject other than being in method\n\n382\n00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.100\nbundled up together with it.\n\n383\n00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.537\nAnd then playNote.\n\n384\n00:23:44.537 --> 00:23:49.596\nWell, I need to grab all the playNotes,\nall of that inner part,\n\n385\n00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:54.654\nand also I am utilizing the event\nobject as a way to look through,\n\n386\n00:23:54.654 --> 00:24:00.010\nselect, except there's one\nexception I wanna change.\n\n387\n00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.580\nI'm searching the entire document for\nthis.\n\n388\n00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:06.640\nThis may be quicker, more performant in\nthe long term, if instead of searching\n\n389\n00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.420\nthe entire document,\nI search within this application.\n\n390\n00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:16.550\nSo instead of document I can\nsay this.app and this.app and\n\n391\n00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.920\nthen I can search inside of that div\nthat contains all of my other markup.\n\n392\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.750\nSo, if we've done this right Daniel,\nthis should work.\n\n393\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.452\nShould is a very important key\nword in a lot of the things I do.\n\n394\n00:24:28.452 --> 00:24:29.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that gonna work?\n\n395\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.016\nIt should.\n\n396\n00:24:31.016 --> 00:24:32.610\nIt should work.\n\n397\n00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:33.404\n&gt;&gt; I have faith in you Justin.\n\n398\n00:24:33.404 --> 00:24:35.290\nI believe that it will actually work.\n\n399\n00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.030\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna create a new piano.\n\n400\n00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.220\n&gt;&gt; Don't you dare let me down.\n\n401\n00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.450\n&gt;&gt; No pressure.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.050\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna create a new piano and\n\n403\n00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.660\nthe only argument to my\nconstructor is in fact,\n\n404\n00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.170\nthe element that\nthe application lives within.\n\n405\n00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:53.300\nSo now I can construct a bunch of pianos,\nand have them other places.\n\n406\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.860\nThere is a couple things we need to fix,\nthat that's not quite the case,\n\n407\n00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.230\nbut let's see if it works.\n\n408\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.350\nWe've only made a few changes.\n\n409\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.193\nWe refresh, and I need a,\n\n410\n00:25:04.193 --> 00:25:08.233\n[MUSIC]\n\n411\n00:25:08.233 --> 00:25:09.780\nAnd it looks like we're all good.\n\n412\n00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.430\nWe have that refractor.\n\n413\n00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.825\nNow Daniel, there's a few more\nthings that we wanna do but\n\n414\n00:25:14.825 --> 00:25:17.885\nI'm not sure we quite have\nthe time in this episode.\n\n415\n00:25:17.885 --> 00:25:22.120\nIt may not be a lengthy portion but\nI think it's longer than we have here.\n\n416\n00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well not a problem.\n\n417\n00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.370\nWe will definitely move on to\na part 3B culmination if you will,\n\n418\n00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.420\nof all these lovely little things\nthat Justin is trying to teach us.\n\n419\n00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:31.970\nThat being said,\n\n420\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:35.650\nis there anything else we need to add to\nthis episode before we close the show?\n\n421\n00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.940\n&gt;&gt; I think that will be it.\n\n422\n00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.089\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthank you for joining us today.\n\n423\n00:25:39.089 --> 00:25:40.019\nWe thank Justin for\n\n424\n00:25:40.019 --> 00:25:44.240\nteaching us all these grand things that\nwe can use inside of our own web apps.\n\n425\n00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.400\nLet's gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV,\n\n426\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.770\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n427\n00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:49.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n428\n00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.150\n&gt;&gt; We'll see ya next time.\n\n429\n00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.159\n[MUSIC]\n\n430\n00:25:58.159 --> 00:26:00.100\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

It goes well, thank you for\nhaving me back Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.150\nHow are you today?\n\n13\n00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.310\n&gt;&gt; I cannot complain, thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.790\n&gt;&gt; That's always good, it would be really\nawkward if one day you just went, well,\n\n15\n00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.390\nlet me tell you.\n\n16\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me tell you.\n\n17\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.585\n&gt;&gt; How much time you got buddy?\n\n18\n00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:43.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Been a rough day.\n\n19\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.350\n&gt;&gt; We're about to get into it.\n\n20\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.130\n&gt;&gt; But we started on this piano\napplication and for all intents and\n\n21\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.780\npurposes, we're pretty close to done.\n\n22\n00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.738\nBut there's a few things that,\nI did a code review with my boss.\n\n23\n00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:57.080\nAgain, I'm role-playing here,\nthis is something you may actually hear.\n\n24\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.320\nYou still have things\nattached to the global scope,\n\n25\n00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.930\nI have Window listening for\nthe key presses and I don't want that.\n\n26\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.960\nI wanna be able to move this around and\nits self-contained.\n\n27\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.120\nWell, we probably need to fix that and\nI think that'll tidy it up but\n\n28\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.640\nwe definitely gotta make that work.\n\n29\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.850\nSo let's go ahead and drive in.\n\n30\n00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.600\nLet's remind ourselves of where we are,\n\n31\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.140\ngot all of our code\nencapsulated in a class.\n\n32\n00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.290\nAnd then our class is being\ninstantiated right here on line 41.\n\n33\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.700\nNotice I don't have to sign\nthat to a variable because,\n\n34\n00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.330\nwell, I'm just creating\nan instance of the application.\n\n35\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.720\nIn addition to my boss, as odd as it\nsounds, he's like, I don't want to.\n\n36\n00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.560\nCompleting the global scope,\ncuz I want multiple pianos.\n\n37\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.430\nI wanna be able to match different\nsounds,to different keys.\n\n38\n00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.070\nKind of there is tutorial organs,\nright [SOUND] like so.\n\n39\n00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.730\n&gt;&gt; You like the pianist for yes [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, men that, so\n\n40\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.730\nwe need to fix those issues, and\nwhere is that global scope name?\n\n41\n00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.340\nKind of that name pollution coming from.\n\n42\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.019\nLet's look back through our code here, and\n\n43\n00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:09.339\nthere's a window [SOUND] let's see here,\nI think that's it, right?\n\n44\n00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:13.470\nSo there's my window, so\nhow are we gonna fix that?\n\n45\n00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.880\nWell, let's go back and remind\nourselves a little bit what's going on.\n\n46\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.000\nNow I have my sound turned off, but if you\ncan see the keypresses are being locked.\n\n47\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.510\nWell, you're like for\n\n48\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.650\nthe window instead of listening to the\nwindow let's just change this to this.app.\n\n49\n00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.430\nOkay, that make sense because I\nwanna listen to the application.\n\n50\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.879\nThe occasion should listen for\nkey presses, but\n\n51\n00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.183\nif I do that and I refresh notice\nI no longer have key presses.\n\n52\n00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:45.242\nI'm wrecking my hand across the keyboard,\nthat's how I play piano by the way,\n\n53\n00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:48.105\nI just wreck my hand across\nthe keyboard as such.\n\n54\n00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:52.545\nBut it's not working,\nhow are we gonna fix this?\n\n55\n00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:57.708\nWell, if we change, when we make this app,\n\n56\n00:02:57.708 --> 00:03:01.210\nright, this .app is document\naqueous selector for the element.\n\n57\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.640\nIf we change a property, now I know\nthis is adding some weirdness here,\n\n58\n00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.490\nwe're gonna see if this works.\n\n59\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.260\nAnd we're gonna pull this out into\na different Method just because we wanna\n\n60\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.850\nkeep these concerns separated.\n\n61\n00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.490\nWe can say this this.app.tabIndex = 1,\nokay.\n\n62\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.341\nSo now if I go back and refresh, if I If I\nclick, notice I have this highlight\n\n63\n00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:32.197\nI'm now focused on this cuz I have added\nthat attribute to the DOM element.\n\n64\n00:03:32.197 --> 00:03:38.930\nI have have my piano back and I remove\nthe reliance on that global window object.\n\n65\n00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.470\nThat's good to know but\nnow I have another problem cache dom?\n\n66\n00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.947\nWell it's doing something else\nbesides just caching dom,\n\n67\n00:03:47.947 --> 00:03:50.900\nit's modifying the application.\n\n68\n00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.490\nThis is one line, but this is the thought\nprocess that you should go through.\n\n69\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.160\nI want to add a method called add focus,\nthat's probably a good name,\n\n70\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.190\na very descriptive name,\nthat's what it's going to allow us to do.\n\n71\n00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.097\nAnd I'm gonna grab this line and\n\n72\n00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:11.931\nput it here, now-\n&gt;&gt; I like what you've done there.\n\n73\n00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:16.371\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't do that apparently,\nI'm just gonna retype that because\n\n74\n00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:20.130\napparently my copy paste\nis doing some crazy stuff.\n\n75\n00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.280\nSo this .app.tabIndex is equal to 1.\n\n76\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.700\nAll right, so now that I have addFocus,\nthis should happen after cacheDon.\n\n77\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.420\nBut before addListeners, that's part of\nconstruction of the piano application.\n\n78\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.616\nRight on the screen, but\ntake this and say, this to addFocus.\n\n79\n00:04:43.372 --> 00:04:43.970\nThere we go.\n\n80\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.680\nNow in all intents and purposes,\nif you had that one line in cacheDom for\n\n81\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.370\na small application like this,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n82\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.870\nBut you should get into\nthe process of thinking, well,\n\n83\n00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.930\ncaching dom is doing only that,\nit is caching the dom.\n\n84\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.030\nAdding listeners to addListeners or\naddEventListeners or Ad handlers,\n\n85\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.520\nwhatever you wanna call this method,\nshould do just those things.\n\n86\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.110\nIt's called the single\nresponsibility principle and\n\n87\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.920\nit helps with keeping things straight,\nif you need to go make changes, right?\n\n88\n00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.570\nIf this focus doesn't work\nout I don't have to remember,\n\n89\n00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.880\nsix months' down the road,\nwhere did I put that?\n\n90\n00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.300\nIs that in cacheDom addEventListeners?\n\n91\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.710\nAnd then I've seen worse things where\npeople will add stuff like that inside\n\n92\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.920\nof playNote,\nwhich will happen all the time.\n\n93\n00:05:28.985 --> 00:05:32.775\nDefinitely pull those out in\nseparate methods or functions,\n\n94\n00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:35.995\ndepending on how you structure your\napplication, so you don't have to think.\n\n95\n00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:38.485\nLet's go make sure that that works.\n\n96\n00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:40.775\nBoom boom, and there we go.\n\n97\n00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:42.685\nNow I have my sound turned off just so\n\n98\n00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:46.860\nwe don't have reverberation as I\nrake my hand across this keyboard.\n\n99\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.690\nBut our final test,\nif we duplicate the markup and\n\n100\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.200\nwe instantiate another piano,\ncan we get two pianos on a screen?\n\n101\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.820\nThat helps us test whether we have\nencapsulated this appropriately\n\n102\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.070\nto move it between projects.\n\n103\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.782\nLet's see, so I have all of this is good.\n\n104\n00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.020\nI'm gonna create another piano.\n\n105\n00:06:10.713 --> 00:06:14.490\nAnd that is not how you\nspell any of those.\n\n106\n00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.639\n&gt;&gt; Justin's trying to create his\nown new features in EL6 [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just putting [SOUND] so,\n\n108\n00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:23.416\nI have that, it's not gonna work.\n\n109\n00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.560\nIt's broke and why is that?\n\n110\n00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.480\nI'm trying to unstantiate a piano that\ndoesn't have the required markup.\n\n111\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.640\nSo, I'm gonna hop in to my Index.HTML and\n\n112\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.250\nI'm just gonna grab this entire\nchunk here and why is that?\n\n113\n00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.154\nBecause this is encapsulated, all of this\nis necessary for the app and effectively,\n\n114\n00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:48.320\nthis div is the beginning and\nend of the module or the application.\n\n115\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.850\nIt's the beginning and end point,\nit's where I can grab everything, so\n\n116\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.590\nI'm gonna copy and I'm gonna paste.\n\n117\n00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.410\nThe paste work, thank goodness and\nthen two, right?\n\n118\n00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.890\nSo there's the ID for the new app and\nI'm instantiating a second one.\n\n119\n00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.720\nWe're going to cross our fingers, Daniel.\n\n120\n00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.670\nHopefully this works and then I can submit\nthis to my boss and we'll be good to go.\n\n121\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.710\nSo I refresh and we have a problem.\n\n122\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.800\nWhat is that problem?\n\n123\n00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.500\nWell, let's go look at elements and\nif we look here.\n\n124\n00:07:22.712 --> 00:07:26.213\n[SOUND] What happened?\n\n125\n00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:32.366\nWell, if we go into our CSS, notice\nI'm styling just for this application.\n\n126\n00:07:32.366 --> 00:07:34.990\nNow we're using an ID,\nthere is not a lot we can do there,\n\n127\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.184\nthis is a little bit of duplication\nof code, you shouldn't do this.\n\n128\n00:07:38.184 --> 00:07:44.188\nBut I'm gonna test to see if this\nis modular, so I'm going to paste,\n\n129\n00:07:44.188 --> 00:07:48.860\nadd a two, cross your fingers,\ncross your fingers.\n\n130\n00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:54.870\nAnd it's down there, we got something\ndown there, what's going on?\n\n131\n00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.180\nWhy's it doing that?\n\n132\n00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:04.000\nLet's see here, My copy and\npaste did some weird stuff.\n\n133\n00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.080\nIt didn't actually give me\nanything that was folded up, so\n\n134\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.100\nI have a single open div and nothing else.\n\n135\n00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.050\n&gt;&gt; Nothing in it [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n136\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.540\nbe careful of copy paste.this\nis why I'm a big proponent of\n\n137\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.300\nbe careful when you copy and paste\nbecause this can propagate errors, right?\n\n138\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.050\nYou should type, keep things, I mean\nlittle small segments you'll be all right.\n\n139\n00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.340\nBut large swats, I thought I had\neverything that I needed for\n\n140\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.360\nthe application and I was like, man.\n\n141\n00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.830\nI haven't seen this before\nbecause of experience.\n\n142\n00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.620\nThis could've taken me one, two, three\nhours because I just assumed that copy and\n\n143\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.620\npaste work, so,\nbe very careful About the copy pasta.\n\n144\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.970\nSo, I'm gonna copy,\nI've selected the whole block.\n\n145\n00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:55.670\nLet's see if it works and there is app and\nI'm gonna add a two here.\n\n146\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.960\nSave and refresh and\nnow I do have two pianos,\n\n147\n00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.370\nthere's my first one\n&gt;&gt; And if I focused on the next one,\n\n148\n00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:08.910\nthat one works and let see if we can get\nthe sound going up here, there we go.\n\n149\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.974\n[MUSIC]\n\n150\n00:09:11.974 --> 00:09:16.240\nNotice these are not highlighting but\nnow if I select this.\n\n151\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.593\n[MUSIC]\nThere we go,\n\n152\n00:09:17.593 --> 00:09:23.460\nI've properly encapsulated this into\na class I can move this between projects.\n\n153\n00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.640\nThe only dependencies that I have are kind\nof these three pieces of the component.\n\n154\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.180\nThe CSS for the component, the app.js.\n\n155\n00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.840\nAnd what I mean by component,\nthis chunk of functionality, the styling,\n\n156\n00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.138\nthe layout, and the actual behavior.\n\n157\n00:09:38.138 --> 00:09:43.620\nso the app.js, the main CSS,\nand this little bit of\n\n158\n00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:49.050\nindex sort HTML all bundle together\nit can go anywhere you needed now.\n\n159\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:54.170\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, it very much is, and\n\n164\n00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.363\nyou'll notice if you start doing\nsome reading about web development.\n\n165\n00:10:07.363 --> 00:10:10.817\nYou'll see there's some\nNeuroWeb frameworks have taken\n\n166\n00:10:10.817 --> 00:10:15.780\ndifferent routes on how to make sure all\nof these are always bundled together.\n\n167\n00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.060\nBecause they do have an interplay but\nDaniel,\n\n168\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.550\nI think this is actually\ngoing to make my boss happy.\n\n169\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.890\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, we've made the piano,\nit works great, you type in the thing.\n\n170\n00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.090\nThe keys light up with\nthe appropriate sound and\n\n171\n00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.470\nnow we're able to make that more modular.\n\n172\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.530\nIf I want to create another one,\nit's pretty simple to do so.\n\n173\n00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.510\nA little bit of copying and pasting,\ncarefully as it were, right?\n\n174\n00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.750\nAnd then you can make that happen,\njust a little bit of code change there.\n\n175\n00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.150\nNothing too fancy about that.\n\n176\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.240\nAnything else that we need to talk about\nwhen it comes to our little app here?\n\n177\n00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, I do have a challenge,\nDaniel, a challenge.\n\n178\n00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.270\n&gt;&gt; Challenge.\n\n179\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:53.360\n&gt;&gt; I have not provided the notes for\nthe piano, see if you can go find them.\n\n180\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.960\nSee if you can be resourceful as part\nof your web development practice.\n\n181\n00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.380\nAnd see if you can pull in, it doesn't\nhave to be notes maybe it could be\n\n182\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.540\nanimal sounds or drum beats or\nanything of that nature.\n\n183\n00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.650\nIt doesn't have to be\na piano make it your own, so\n\n184\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.520\nI've intentionally left that out because\nI would like to see what you can do.\n\n185\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.950\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, well,\nthat wraps up our piano web app.\n\n186\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.200\nHopefully, you've learned a lot through\nthe little mini series that we created\n\n187\n00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.240\ninside of our series here\nto create that web app.\n\n188\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.940\nVery cool stuff and being able to work\nwith those Key Board Events, that is\n\n189\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.320\nsomething you should've taken away from\nthis, and a lot of other things as well.\n\n190\n00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.780\nEspecially when it comes to\nmaking sure you apply changes\n\n191\n00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.250\nto each part of the app itself.\n\n192\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.020\nThat being said, Justin,\nthanks for joining us, but\n\n193\n00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.860\nit looks like we've come to\nthe end of our little show here.\n\n194\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.080\nWe thank you guys for watching,\nso signing off for ITProTV.\n\n195\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.701\nI've been you host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n196\n00:11:45.701 --> 00:11:46.813\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n197\n00:11:46.813 --> 00:11:49.396\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n198\n00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:55.890\n[MUSIC]\n\n199\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.422\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
