DevPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.544\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:21.985\nwe're continuing on in our Intro\nto WordPress Development series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:22.821\nThat was a mouthful,\n\n6\n00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:25.431\nhow's a little afraid that I wasn't\ngonna get that out this time.\n\n7\n00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:28.498\nAnd we're gonna be looking at\ncreating a settings page, and\n\n8\n00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:30.915\nwell I'm kind of intrigued\nat what that means.\n\n9\n00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:34.994\nAnd luckily we have someone that knows all\nabout it, the man, the myth, the legend,\n\n10\n00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:35.913\nMr. Frank Corso.\n\n11\n00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:36.880\nHow are you doing today, Frank?\n\n12\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.442\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:38.310\nHow are you doing today?\n\n14\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.868\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Frank, and\nwell creating a settings page,right?\n\n15\n00:00:41.868 --> 00:00:44.654\nWe're setting up,\nwhat are we going to talk about?\n\n16\n00:00:44.654 --> 00:00:46.417\nBut really, I'm kind of interested.\n\n17\n00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:49.540\nWhy would I create a settings page?\n\n18\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.460\nWhat is a settings page?\n\n19\n00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.390\nCan you give us some background of why we\nwould do anything with a settings page?\n\n20\n00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure,\nwith settings page is a very general term.\n\n21\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.810\nIt can mean a lot of different things.\n\n22\n00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.390\nWithin WordPress, there's probably\ngonna be a time that you want\n\n23\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.960\nto have a setting or\noption that a user can go in and change.\n\n24\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.932\nSo for example, maybe you have a WordPress\ntheme, and you want it then be able to go\n\n25\n00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:13.170\nin and change the site name, or\nchange the layout on a navigation.\n\n26\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.870\nOr maybe you had a plugin,\nmaybe you have a store, and\n\n27\n00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.719\nyou want them to be able to go in and\nchange what tax code they're following.\n\n28\n00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.697\nOr the decimal places, or\nwhat currency you're accepting in.\n\n29\n00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:27.297\nIf you have may be a quiz plugin, maybe\nyou want them to be able to go in and\n\n30\n00:01:27.297 --> 00:01:29.420\ncreate the questions for the quiz.\n\n31\n00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.020\nSo these are all different pages\nthat you'd want to create within\n\n32\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.410\nthe WordPress admin.\n\n33\n00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.552\nSo let's jump to the laptop screen,\nand we'll take a look here.\n\n34\n00:01:36.552 --> 00:01:40.210\nWithin WordPress, these different\nmenus that already come in by default.\n\n35\n00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.190\nSo you have some of the menus\nwe've interacted with before,\n\n36\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.610\nsuch as the Post and the Pages,\nthe Appearance, the Plugins.\n\n37\n00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.730\nThese are all different\nmenus that are by default.\n\n38\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.430\nYou can create your own menu and\nthen have different pages within it, or\n\n39\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.589\nyou can create your own page in\nany of these existing menus.\n\n40\n00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.140\nSo to get started we're gonna create\nour very first settings page and\n\n41\n00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.680\nwe're going to put it\nwithin the settings menu.\n\n42\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.796\nThis is a good practice if you have\na very small, simple settings page and\n\n43\n00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:08.818\na simple plugin.\n\n44\n00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:12.087\nSo maybe you have a custom site\nyou're building for a client and\n\n45\n00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:13.887\nit only has a couple small tweaks.\n\n46\n00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:16.154\nYou would create a settings\npage within the settings menu.\n\n47\n00:02:16.154 --> 00:02:19.703\nAnd that way it's not taking up the amin\nmenu area, especially when you have\n\n48\n00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:23.770\nseveral other plugins this side here, can\nend up having 20 to 30 different icons.\n\n49\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.682\nSo you wanna try to limit the amount\nof icons that you have there, so\n\n50\n00:02:26.682 --> 00:02:28.568\nit's not quite as confusing to navigate.\n\n51\n00:02:28.568 --> 00:02:30.892\nSo we're gonna get started\nwith the Settings menu, and\n\n52\n00:02:30.892 --> 00:02:33.280\nwe're gonna create a page there.\n\n53\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.693\nSo we're gonna hop over to,\nLet me zoom out just a little bit.\n\n54\n00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:44.507\nSo the function to do that\nis called add options page.\n\n55\n00:02:44.507 --> 00:02:46.272\nSo we're gonna hop over.\n\n56\n00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:50.369\nAnd lmost all the functions we're gonna\nuse today has these similar parameters\n\n57\n00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:51.236\nthat they take.\n\n58\n00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:56.206\nSo a lot of these have page title, menu\ntitle, capability, slug and functions.\n\n59\n00:02:56.206 --> 00:03:04.400\nAnd what these boil down to is,\nback on the menu, What does it say here?\n\n60\n00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.010\nAnd then who's allowed to click on it, and\nthen when it opens, what gets displayed.\n\n61\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.840\nThose are what those\nparameters boil down to.\n\n62\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.620\nSo over here, the page title is the text\nto be displayed in the title tag.\n\n63\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.070\nAnd then the menu title would be displayed\nfor, oop, actually within the menu.\n\n64\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.140\nAnd I will touch on capabilities\nin just a moment, but\n\n65\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.299\nthen the slug when we go to any of these\npages, so we'll open up the reading page.\n\n66\n00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.717\nThe slug usually defines what\nis up in the menu bar and\n\n67\n00:03:35.717 --> 00:03:40.780\nhow's that page referenced within\nall the other scope of WordPress.\n\n68\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.936\nSo this is sort of like the ID\nof the page we're creating.\n\n69\n00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:44.985\nI'm gonna use these quite\na bit going forward,\n\n70\n00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:47.507\nso if that doesn't quite make sense yet\nwe'll get there.\n\n71\n00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:51.049\nBut think of it more of the ID\nof the page we're creating.\n\n72\n00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:51.664\n&gt;&gt; Frank-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n73\n00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.601\n&gt;&gt; Let me jump in here real quick.\n\n74\n00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:55.825\nSo we're in the WordPress here Codex.\n\n75\n00:03:55.825 --> 00:04:00.663\nAnd you just looked up a function add,\nwhat is it, add options page?\n\n76\n00:04:00.663 --> 00:04:03.025\nAnd that's it, right?\n\n77\n00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:06.925\nSo we're gonna write code that will\nadd something to our menu dynamically.\n\n78\n00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:10.521\nAnd that's ultimately what\nwe're doing right now, right?\n\n79\n00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:13.927\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nthere's several functions we'll be using.\n\n80\n00:04:13.927 --> 00:04:17.702\nBut add options page is the function we'll\nuse that creates that settings page in\n\n81\n00:04:17.702 --> 00:04:20.020\nthe settings menu that I referred to.\n\n82\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.437\nThere's almost every page here, I will go\nahead and bring up the list of functions.\n\n83\n00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:26.747\nWe're not gonna touch on\nall of these todays, but\n\n84\n00:04:26.747 --> 00:04:29.288\nall these different functions\non the right side here.\n\n85\n00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:33.240\nLet me scroll up just a little bit so you\ncan see all the different functions there.\n\n86\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.675\nThese are all different functions to\nadd some pages to the existing menu.\n\n87\n00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.487\nSo the one we're gonna look\nat is the add_options page.\n\n88\n00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:40.740\nThey almost all work the same for\nthe existing menus.\n\n89\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.534\nSo we're not gonna dive\ninto every single one.\n\n90\n00:04:42.534 --> 00:04:46.802\nBut the add_options, the very bottom\nthere, is the one we'll be looking at.\n\n91\n00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:47.934\nLet me scroll up just so here.\n\n92\n00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:50.580\nBut again, they all work the same.\n\n93\n00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.690\nIf you just search for,\nwhat is the title of this page?\n\n94\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.660\nThe Administration Menus, you'll get\na list of all the different functions that\n\n95\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.654\nyou can use to add settings\nthroughout the dashboard.\n\n96\n00:05:01.654 --> 00:05:04.440\nAnd e'll be using some of the functions\non the left to define our own\n\n97\n00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.380\nonce we finish the options page.\n\n98\n00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.108\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n99\n00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:10.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that clears it up,\nI was like all right, so\n\n100\n00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:14.164\nwe're writing code to add a page in order,\nI got it though, right?\n\n101\n00:05:14.164 --> 00:05:18.669\nWe're adding something to the page using\ncode, but then there's further things that\n\n102\n00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.250\nwe need to do after that from\nmy understanding, right?\n\n103\n00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nwe're just reviewing the parameters, so\n\n104\n00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.390\nwe get an understanding of how these work.\n\n105\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.637\nAnd then we're gonna look at\nan example of actually using this.\n\n106\n00:05:29.637 --> 00:05:32.863\nOkay, so the last part is the function.\n\n107\n00:05:32.863 --> 00:05:34.730\nAnd this is what we're about to build,\n\n108\n00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.005\nthis is what handles\nwhat actually gets shown.\n\n109\n00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:41.038\nSo how this works is we say, hey,\nwe have the system of hooks and\n\n110\n00:05:41.038 --> 00:05:44.470\nfilters that we've gone\nover multiple times.\n\n111\n00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.083\nAnd they go through and\nthey go, hey, we're looking for\n\n112\n00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:51.016\nthe admin menu right now, we're creating\nthe settings menu, do you have any pages?\n\n113\n00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:54.788\nAnd we use this function to go, hey,\nwe have a page, let's add our page in.\n\n114\n00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:57.880\nAnd so we pass a function to it,\nand that function will get called\n\n115\n00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.550\nwhenever that page loads, so that handles\nthe output of the contents of the page.\n\n116\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.453\nSo let's go ahead and work on an example.\n\n117\n00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:10.790\nSo before we had our intro-wp plugin that\nwe've been playing with last few episodes.\n\n118\n00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.180\nSo we're gonna use a little\nbit more room here today.\n\n119\n00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.506\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nremove the tree navigation there.\n\n120\n00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:17.655\nAnd I'm gonna scroll all\nthe way to the bottom,\n\n121\n00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:21.070\nI already commented out a lot\nof the ones we've used before.\n\n122\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:28.416\nAnd then we are going to, let's go ahead\nand just copy and paste this for now.\n\n123\n00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:36.733\nJust so we can, Make these new lines, so\n\n124\n00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:37.548\nit's a little easier to\nread here on the screen.\n\n125\n00:06:37.548 --> 00:06:40.820\nGo up just here.\n\n126\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.440\nOkay, so\nwe're just gonna call it something random.\n\n127\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.417\nSo we'll literally type\nin something random.\n\n128\n00:07:01.632 --> 00:07:05.047\nOkay, we'll go over capabilities in\njust a moment, so let me go ahead and\n\n129\n00:07:05.047 --> 00:07:06.600\ntype something in there for now.\n\n130\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.601\nSo this is our intro_wp_random_page.\n\n131\n00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:18.206\nSo the menu slug, this could be anything,\nbefore we've had slugs for\n\n132\n00:07:18.206 --> 00:07:22.437\nour custom post sites,\nwe had slugs for different taxonomies.\n\n133\n00:07:22.437 --> 00:07:25.774\nSo this is a similar concept,\nsimilar things you can put in here,\n\n134\n00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:27.230\nusually characters.\n\n135\n00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.620\nUsually a good description, and\n\n136\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.420\nsomething that would not be used again\nby another plug-in or another theme.\n\n137\n00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.020\nSo you wanna aim for, usually the name\nof your plugin like we've been doing.\n\n138\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.020\nPreviously we had,\nwhere's the product we had?\n\n139\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.130\nWe had, I thought we had something, yeah,\nwe had our FC underscore color, and\n\n140\n00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.500\nFC underscore tax type,\nthings along those lines.\n\n141\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.285\nSo you'd wanna do something similar\ndo define your slug as it's own,\n\n142\n00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:52.541\nso no one else might accidentally use it.\n\n143\n00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:55.552\nIf for what ever reason you had\nmaybe a product settings page, and\n\n144\n00:07:55.552 --> 00:07:57.633\nanother plug in had\na product settings page,\n\n145\n00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:01.659\nWordPress would either try to add both, or\nwould get confused or, It would get messy.\n\n146\n00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:05.283\nSo you want to word your slugs\nin a way that it's unique.\n\n147\n00:08:05.283 --> 00:08:07.880\nAnd then our function,\nwhich we'll define in just a moment.\n\n148\n00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.525\nBut we'll go ahead and\njust say FC, settings page.\n\n149\n00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:17.479\n[SOUND]\nOkay,\n\n150\n00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:22.230\nand since this is a callback, we're gonna\npass the string as the function name.\n\n151\n00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.330\nSo instead of putting it without the\nquotes, we're gonna have quotes around it.\n\n152\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.530\nAnd that way WordPress, later on, they'll\nuse a function to call that function,\n\n153\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.120\nthat requires the function\nas a string name.\n\n154\n00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:34.530\nAll ready, so, yes?\n\n155\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.840\n&gt;&gt; Now Frank, before we get too far ahead,\nI was thinking about that slug naming and\n\n156\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.520\nthings like that.\n\n157\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.490\nAre there a set of conventions\nthat we should follow that will\n\n158\n00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.900\nkind of minimize the pains?\n\n159\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.825\nObviously we wanna keep them I wanna\nmake sure that they're unique.\n\n160\n00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:49.870\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right, we shouldn't reuse those.\n\n161\n00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.500\nBut as far as are there disallowed\ncharacters or anything like that,\n\n162\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.610\nthat we need to be aware of?\n\n163\n00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.160\n&gt;&gt; Well this,\nsomething to think about is the slug\n\n164\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.120\nusually gets added into the URL index and\npeople could be linking to it.\n\n165\n00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.920\nSo you wanna have all of your characters\nfollow characters that could be in a URL.\n\n166\n00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.770\nThat's usually a good starting place and\nthen other functions,\n\n167\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.110\nthere'll be other functions that\nwe'll explore in just a few minutes.\n\n168\n00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.820\nThat people can add additional\npages to different slugs and\n\n169\n00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.550\ndifferent settings to\nthe slugs you define.\n\n170\n00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.940\nSo you want strings\nthat can be in URLs and\n\n171\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.280\nstrings that can be used as\nin different other functions.\n\n172\n00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.590\nSo almost every character is okay.\n\n173\n00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.040\nYou want it, the URL character, acceptable\ncharacters in URLs is the big one.\n\n174\n00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.690\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n175\n00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just making sure it\nwasn't one of those things where,\n\n176\n00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.850\nif you use an exclamation point and\nyou break all kinds, I'm just saying,\n\n177\n00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.255\nI don't think I use exclamation\npoints in URLs too much.\n\n178\n00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:39.930\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n179\n00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.540\n&gt;&gt; But there are ways.\n\n180\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.487\n[CROSSTALK] I didn't know if it\nwas disallowed character types or\n\n181\n00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:44.178\nsomething like that.\n\n182\n00:09:44.178 --> 00:09:46.598\n&gt;&gt; For the most part you wanna\nstick to just alpha numeric and\n\n183\n00:09:46.598 --> 00:09:48.170\nmaybe underscores like we did here.\n\n184\n00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.890\nAnd that's usually the best\npractice that most people use.\n\n185\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.950\nOkay, so I touched on\ncapabilities multiple times so\n\n186\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.390\nlet's take a look at\nactually what that is.\n\n187\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.150\nNow in a future episode we're gonna\nhave an entire episode about roles and\n\n188\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.410\ncapabilities and all this jargon\nthat I'm about to throw at you.\n\n189\n00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.630\nBut, WordPress boils\ndown to permission sets.\n\n190\n00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.780\nDepending on what frameworks you've\nplayed with before, or none of them.\n\n191\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.160\nOr even if you just had your phone or\nanything else,\n\n192\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.980\nyou've had permissions you've\nencountered before possibly.\n\n193\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.790\nAnd within WordPress it has roles and\ncapabilities.\n\n194\n00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.600\nRoles aren't really used anymore.\n\n195\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.810\nBut back when WordPress first got started,\nit had an administrator,\n\n196\n00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.300\na subscriber, an editor, and these roles\ndefined what you were allowed to do.\n\n197\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.160\nSo if you were an admin you could\ninstall plug-ins and themes and\n\n198\n00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.040\nmanipulate settings.\n\n199\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.560\nIf you were just a subscriber\nyou could only view content.\n\n200\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.380\nIf you were an author you could create\ncontent, but not adjust settings.\n\n201\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.610\nSo these were different roles that\nenabled different permissions.\n\n202\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.970\nAs WordPress grew,\n\n203\n00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.670\nit realized they needed a little bit\nmore granular level of permissions, so\n\n204\n00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.600\nyou could have any author that you wanna\ngive access to, modify the thing too.\n\n205\n00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.690\nOr maybe you have an editor and\n\n206\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.490\nthey need to edit some of\nthe settings to a certain plugin.\n\n207\n00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:03.030\nThese would be granular permissions that\nwere a bit beyond where role could enable\n\n208\n00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.400\nand that's where capabilities came in.\n\n209\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.120\nSo we're gonna scroll\ndown to an example here.\n\n210\n00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.080\nSo there's different capabilities.\n\n211\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.180\nAnd these capabilities define\nwhat a particular user could do.\n\n212\n00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.160\nFor example,\nby default an admin can activate plugins.\n\n213\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.080\nNow, by default, and author and\na subscriber cannot activate plugins.\n\n214\n00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.840\nBut we could say hey we want to\nallow this particular author,\n\n215\n00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.100\nor all authors, to activate plugins.\n\n216\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.940\nSo we can give this permission to others\npeople and other roles, and we can define\n\n217\n00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.140\nwhat roles and what capabilities\nare required to access our content.\n\n218\n00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.200\nSo we're gonna scroll down,\nwe're gonna look for manage_options.\n\n219\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.770\nThat's the one we'll be using, so\nwe can look for, hey, what setting,\n\n220\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.620\nor what capability,\nis unique to administrator.\n\n221\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:57.470\nBut maybe you want to have everyone but,\nso let's scroll down to.\n\n222\n00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.550\nDo a render right now, I'm going to\nshow here and scroll down one more.\n\n223\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:08.180\nSo this nice chart here, so\nyou can scroll through and\n\n224\n00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:12.370\nsay hey I want only administrators and\neditors to access my page.\n\n225\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.470\nOr I want everyone to access my page or\n\n226\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.060\nmaybe you want to define\nit to certain level.\n\n227\n00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.160\nThat is where you can come down to\nthis chart here and you can go,\n\n228\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.440\nI want super admins that's a whole\nother topic, we'll get to that.\n\n229\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.360\nBut for now, let's look at administrator,\neditor, author, contributor,\n\n230\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:26.990\nor subscriber.\n\n231\n00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.400\nMaybe we just want admins and\neditors to access of settings page.\n\n232\n00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.830\nSo we can scroll down and look for\n\n233\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:36.070\na setting that only has these two for\ncapability.\n\n234\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.470\nSo the ability to moderate comments,\nand that is only allowed by default.\n\n235\n00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.960\nBy administrators and editors.\n\n236\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.840\nSo we could copy this and\npaste it here and\n\n237\n00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.400\nnow the only people that could access our\npage would be administrators and editors.\n\n238\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.930\nIf we wanted maybe even authors we\ncould scroll down a little bit to maybe\n\n239\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.900\nthe ability to publish posts.\n\n240\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.720\nI'm gonna copy and paste that in,\nand now administrators, editors, and\n\n241\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.650\nauthors by default could access our page.\n\n242\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.150\nSo for now, yes, Justin?\n\n243\n00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:13.080\n&gt;&gt; So are capabilities\nessentially like permission sets?\n\n244\n00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.440\nCan we use them as permission sets, or are\nthere semantic meaning to publish posts.\n\n245\n00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.830\nWhen I think publish posts I\nwouldn't think that that's\n\n246\n00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.560\ndetermining the user set of\nroles that can access my page.\n\n247\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.460\nI would think, well I'm adding\nthe capability to publish posts.\n\n248\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.290\nMaybe I have that all backwards,\ncould you really nail that down for me?\n\n249\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it is a little confusing\nbecause how WordPress started and\n\n250\n00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.300\nthen how they've shifted.\n\n251\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.860\nSo the terms are a little bit looser\n\n252\n00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.380\nthan you might encounter\nwith other permission sets.\n\n253\n00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.620\nSo the capability is sort\nof just permission level.\n\n254\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.650\nSo, maybe if you were thinking back.\n\n255\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.070\nMaybe if you host websites or\nyou do some other application.\n\n256\n00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.900\nYou might have a permission\nthat you can say hey,\n\n257\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.530\nthis person can modify\nthe network settings.\n\n258\n00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.970\nIf you add settings in there,\n\n259\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:59.350\nor you do things there, then only\nthat person could make those changes.\n\n260\n00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.710\nWhere as with WordPress, they do that same\nthing, but these term's a little bit more,\n\n261\n00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:08.060\nsounds like they're more unique to a blog\nas opposed to actual permission levels.\n\n262\n00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.810\nBut in the current version of WordPress,\n\n263\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.730\nthese are a little bit looser\nthan what they appear to be.\n\n264\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.090\nSo published posts, the person with\nthat capability can publish posts.\n\n265\n00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.830\nBut there's also other settings,\npages, and plugins that look for that\n\n266\n00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.990\nparticular permission to enable them to\ngo to use those other plugins and themes.\n\n267\n00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.636\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n268\n00:14:28.636 --> 00:14:31.610\n&gt;&gt; Somewhat, I think it might become\nclearer as we start to build this out.\n\n269\n00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.410\nBut a follow up question, just because\nI think it's starting to make sense.\n\n270\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.530\nAll those permission sets on the bottom\nof that chart like upload files and\n\n271\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.060\npublish post and the remainder of those.\n\n272\n00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.290\nFrom the capability side,\nif we're using these as a permission\n\n273\n00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.350\nset it doesn't matter which one\nof those if I want super admin,\n\n274\n00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.610\nadmin, editors and authors to have access.\n\n275\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.900\nI just pick one of those\nIs that what I go with, or?\n\n276\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:54.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n277\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.230\nSo in the long run for what we're doing,\n\n278\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.330\nour customer code,\nyou can choose any of these.\n\n279\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.240\nThese aren't really specific,\nthese are almost so\n\n280\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.600\ngeneric they don't really mean\nanything to us right now.\n\n281\n00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.460\nSo we can do upload files,\nor publish posts,\n\n282\n00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.470\nor any of them that just matches\nthe roles we want to target.\n\n283\n00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.190\nAnd the reason why we can't target just a\nrole, like you may have looked at the role\n\n284\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.080\nand you said, well,\nI want editors to be able to do it,\n\n285\n00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.460\nso naturally, editor and administrator,\nthey'd be able to access.\n\n286\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.050\nBut it's because can define other roles.\n\n287\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.290\nSo maybe a plug in comes in and\nthey define a new role of a customer, or\n\n288\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.460\na shop owner, or\nmaybe a quiz owner or a teacher.\n\n289\n00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.830\nThese are new roles that eventually\nwe would be able to add.\n\n290\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.230\nAnd then when they add those, they add\ncertain permissions underneath those.\n\n291\n00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.610\nSo we target a permission that is\nmost likely to be used by the users\n\n292\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.020\nwe want accessing our page.\n\n293\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.650\nSo for example publish post\nis probably used more often\n\n294\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.650\nat a level of editing settings\nthan maybe upload files would be.\n\n295\n00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.150\nSo we try to target it that way.\n\n296\n00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.160\nThat's something you probably won't know\nuntil you really start playing with all\n\n297\n00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.666\nthe different options in code and roles.\n\n298\n00:15:55.666 --> 00:15:57.784\nBut for our case,\nusually just looking down,\n\n299\n00:15:57.784 --> 00:16:00.446\nfinding the one that applies\nto all the roles you want, and\n\n300\n00:16:00.446 --> 00:16:03.344\nthen just choosing any of them is\nusually a good place to start.\n\n301\n00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:07.914\nOkay, so this is the starting place with\nfull recognition that we may have to tweak\n\n302\n00:16:07.914 --> 00:16:11.043\nthis at a later time as our\nneeds could possibly change.\n\n303\n00:16:11.043 --> 00:16:13.950\nOr what we're trying to\nconvey may possibly change.\n\n304\n00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; As long as we're aware of that,\n\n305\n00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.270\nI'm good to go, so.\n\n306\n00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.050\nWe've got capabilities.\n\n307\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:19.865\nAt least started.\n\n308\n00:16:19.865 --> 00:16:21.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So where do we go from here?\n\n309\n00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.830\n&gt;&gt; And we'll have a full episode on\njust rows and capabilities and defining.\n\n310\n00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.970\nSo if that doesn't quite make sense yet,\nwe're gonna use it more today and\n\n311\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.910\nthen we'll also get to\nthat episode as well.\n\n312\n00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.950\nSo let's,\nnow we have our Add Options page.\n\n313\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.914\nSo we're just gonna go hop down and\njust define that function, just so\n\n314\n00:16:36.914 --> 00:16:38.733\nyou can see where that's at for right now.\n\n315\n00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:43.163\nSo we're at function,\n\n316\n00:16:43.163 --> 00:16:50.922\nwe're just gonna toss it here and there.\n\n317\n00:16:54.154 --> 00:16:57.649\nSo everything inside this function\nthis is what is called when\n\n318\n00:16:57.649 --> 00:17:00.360\nsomeone goes to view\nthe page we're defining.\n\n319\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.250\nSo if they were to click on our link in\nthe settings menu, it loads the page and\n\n320\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.750\nthen it calls this function.\n\n321\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.870\nSo this function should output\nsome HTML so that people can see.\n\n322\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.560\nIn our case, we're just gonna\nput a random header for now.\n\n323\n00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.340\nAnd then we'll get into\nmore advanced things later.\n\n324\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.410\nBut this could theoretically be where\nyou have all your forms, your fields.\n\n325\n00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.190\nMaybe some of your documentation, maybe\na way to interact with you or get in touch\n\n326\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.260\nwith you, maybe just things about general\nconcepts of your plug-in and your theme.\n\n327\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.910\nAnything that you want in pages\nwould be within this function, or\n\n328\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.310\nthe functions you attach to your add\noptions page or your menu functions.\n\n329\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.150\nSo, now that we have this function,\nand our content function,\n\n330\n00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.610\nthere's one other step we need to\ndo before this will actually work.\n\n331\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:50.710\nSo I'm gonna come up here and I'm gonna\ncopy and paste for just the moment.\n\n332\n00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.538\nAnd then I'll explain this out.\n\n333\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:57.070\nOoh.\n\n334\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.955\nIf I can spell.\n\n335\n00:17:57.955 --> 00:18:03.805\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n336\n00:18:08.933 --> 00:18:09.473\nSo before,\n\n337\n00:18:09.473 --> 00:18:11.903\nwe had the add option just\nkind of sitting in our file,\n\n338\n00:18:11.903 --> 00:18:14.711\nwhich means it will get called\nwhen the plug-in gets loaded,\n\n339\n00:18:14.711 --> 00:18:17.810\nwhen that file gets included\ninto the WordPress script.\n\n340\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.940\nAnd that's too early for\n\n341\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:24.440\nWordPress, because the menu isn't\ndefined until the hook of admin menu.\n\n342\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.220\nSo we've talked about menus before.\n\n343\n00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.380\nOr hooks before.\n\n344\n00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.020\nSo hooks get fired as\nWordPress is loading.\n\n345\n00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.130\nAnd there's a certain hook\ncalled the admin menu hook.\n\n346\n00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.970\nAnd that is when it calculates\nwhat gets shown in the admin menu.\n\n347\n00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:42.410\nSo if you were to call this\nadd_options_page before that hook,\n\n348\n00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.750\nit won't know where to\nput your settings page.\n\n349\n00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.020\nSo we have to have a hook of admin_menu,\nand a function that hooks into it.\n\n350\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.040\nAnd this is where you would place\nall of your menu functions.\n\n351\n00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.790\nSo if we had multiple pages, we could do\nthem multiple times within this function.\n\n352\n00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.430\nIf we had other menus we wanted to create,\nor\n\n353\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:05.020\nother places, we could create all that\nin this one function of fc_plugin_menu.\n\n354\n00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:10.070\nThe big takeaway is that whatever function\nyou're calling that ad options page or\n\n355\n00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.330\nad dashboard page, or your custom menu.\n\n356\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.750\nHas to be inside a function that\ngets called in the admin menu hook.\n\n357\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.310\nDoes that make sense?\n\n358\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:23.420\nAnd that's to appropriately manage\nthe life cycle of a WordPress application,\n\n359\n00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.270\nor however you would perceive that, right?\n\n360\n00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.840\nSo, I don't want this function to\nbe called and add this until, well,\n\n361\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:34.390\nthe appropriate time for this respective\nadmin menu to be modified, right?\n\n362\n00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.380\nAm I saying that right?\n\n363\n00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, some of the life\ncycle of WordPress, before Admin menu,\n\n364\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.920\nthere's maybe a couple other hooks or\nprocessors or phases like the init phase,\n\n365\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.070\nand plugins are getting loaded,\nthings are getting loaded,\n\n366\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.430\nat that point, WordPress isn't even\nthinking about that admin menu.\n\n367\n00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:52.090\nSo if you try to make call these functions\nright now, it'll go well that's nice,\n\n368\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.690\nwe're not paying attention\nto that right now.\n\n369\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.990\n&gt;&gt; And then nothing will happen, your menu\nwon't appear, your settings won't appear.\n\n370\n00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.840\nSo you want to wait until\nthe appropriate time in WordPress,\n\n371\n00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.130\nwhich is the admin menu.\n\n372\n00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.350\nAnd that's when they're going, hey,\nwhat menus are we looking for right now?\n\n373\n00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.650\nSo you're going,\nhey my setting page, right here.\n\n374\n00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.870\nSo that's the hook to aim for.\n\n375\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.740\nAll right, so let me double check.\n\n376\n00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.360\nWe have our admin menu,\nclient function options page.\n\n377\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.836\nSo this should Where\n\n378\n00:20:21.836 --> 00:20:27.800\nis our, So let's reload this page and see.\n\n379\n00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.480\nThere is our something random,\nand we're gonna open it, and\n\n380\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.740\nthere is our header that we added.\n\n381\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.810\nSo even though we've been\ntalking about this for awhile,\n\n382\n00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.980\ntheoretically this is only,\nwhat is this, 20 lines of code?\n\n383\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.970\nNot even 20 lines of code and we have a\nsettings page with a header already on it.\n\n384\n00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.010\nSo this is within the settings menu.\n\n385\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.160\nAnd like I said before,\nthere were other options here.\n\n386\n00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.690\nThe dashboard, the post, all these.\n\n387\n00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.510\nAnd you would use them as different\nfunctions to place the settings menu or\n\n388\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.710\nsettings page and\nany of these other dashboard menus.\n\n389\n00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.450\nNow, in our last few minutes I just wanted\nto show you the function you would use if\n\n390\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:01.750\nyou wanna create your own menu.\n\n391\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.050\nSo this menu, this page right here,\nI will just copy and\n\n392\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.390\npaste over these two real quick.\n\n393\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:16.310\nSince we're almost out of time we'll\ngo ahead and just drop those in.\n\n394\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.910\nSo these two functions here would be\nif you wanted to create your own menu.\n\n395\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.610\nSo up here maybe you wanted to\nhave some other menu down here.\n\n396\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.260\nIf you installed another plugin\nyou've probably seen this.\n\n397\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.790\nAnd you have so many settings and\n\n398\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.800\nso many different pages you wanna create,\nyou wanna create your own menu.\n\n399\n00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:38.185\nAnd that's where this\nadd_menu_page would come in.\n\n400\n00:21:38.185 --> 00:21:39.105\nAnd if you look,\n\n401\n00:21:39.105 --> 00:21:41.835\nthese are almost the same exact\nparameters we were playing with before.\n\n402\n00:21:41.835 --> 00:21:44.795\nWe have our page title,\nour menu title, our capability.\n\n403\n00:21:45.825 --> 00:21:48.045\nThis time though,\nthere's a few different ones.\n\n404\n00:21:48.045 --> 00:21:51.145\nSo let me scroll over just far\nenough that we can see them all.\n\n405\n00:21:51.145 --> 00:21:54.375\nWe have our menu slug.\n\n406\n00:21:56.125 --> 00:21:57.235\nBefore we had our page slug.\n\n407\n00:21:57.235 --> 00:21:59.310\nThat was the ID of the page itself.\n\n408\n00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.940\nWell now we have a menu slug.\n\n409\n00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.070\nSince we're creating our own menu, we're\nsaying hey, this is the ID of the menu,\n\n410\n00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.910\nand that is used to add\nother pages into that menu.\n\n411\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:12.290\nSomething to think about here is that\nonce you create this particular one,\n\n412\n00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.070\nyou'll probably never be able\nto change again, especially if\n\n413\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:19.130\nyou start adding sub-pages to this menu,\nas well as other plugin developers and\n\n414\n00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.450\ntheme developers could theoretically\nadd pages to your menu.\n\n415\n00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.600\nDepending on how your system is built.\n\n416\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.410\nIf you're releasing a plug-in\nthat other people could extend,\n\n417\n00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.300\nthey could be adding pages into your menu.\n\n418\n00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.000\nAnd at which point if\nyou were to change this,\n\n419\n00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.330\nyou would break everyone else's code.\n\n420\n00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.770\nSo that's something to think about.\n\n421\n00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.470\nWhatever you put there,\n\n422\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.430\nyou probably wanna make sure it's\nsomething that will always work.\n\n423\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.890\nNow the callable function is pretty\nmuch the same way this particular page,\n\n424\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.860\nthis menu what is the top-level page?\n\n425\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.050\nWhenever they click on the menu itself,\nyou can have a page get shown there.\n\n426\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.530\nWe'll work on that in just a moment.\n\n427\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.660\nBut these last two, the icon_url,\nif we look over here,\n\n428\n00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.680\neach of these menus have\nan icon next to it.\n\n429\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.700\nYou're gonna find your own icon for\nyour menu.\n\n430\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.070\nAnd the easiest way to do\nthat is with Dashicons.\n\n431\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:11.220\nSo I briefly mentioned Dashicons\nin a previous episode and\n\n432\n00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:15.740\nessentially these are all these cool\nicons that are built within WordPress.\n\n433\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:22.990\nSo we could randomly choose an icon which\nlet's do the eye, because that looks fun.\n\n434\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.140\nWe could copy and paste this.\n\n435\n00:23:29.057 --> 00:23:32.150\nAnd we could just drop that in and\nnow our menu would have that icon.\n\n436\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.870\nAnd then our last one.\n\n437\n00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.720\nYeah, let's go ahead and switch these out.\n\n438\n00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:42.354\nSo we can, My Menu.\n\n439\n00:23:51.304 --> 00:23:57.456\nWe're gonna do manage options.\n\n440\n00:23:57.456 --> 00:24:04.930\nAnd we'll do intro WP menu just for\nour menu.\n\n441\n00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.217\nWe'll leave that part blank just for\n\n442\n00:24:06.217 --> 00:24:08.630\nright now since we don't have\na function built for that.\n\n443\n00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.830\nNow the very last one is our position,\n\n444\n00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:14.690\nthis is where in what order\nyour menu should fit into.\n\n445\n00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.830\nSo if we hop back over here,\nall of these menus,\n\n446\n00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.960\nyou can add your menu in between\nany of these or at the end.\n\n447\n00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.700\nNow unless it has a certain reason\nthat it needs to be at very up high.\n\n448\n00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.020\nIf it's more of a collection\nof settings pages,\n\n449\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.000\nthat's probably not something that the\nuser will interact with every single day.\n\n450\n00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.660\nWhereas the post,\nthey might be blogging every single day.\n\n451\n00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.980\nThey might be creating different pages or\nmanipulating the media on a daily basis.\n\n452\n00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.110\nSo those are more important.\n\n453\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.970\nSo those are usually up higher.\n\n454\n00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:41.790\nSo it's something to think about.\n\n455\n00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.040\nTheoretically, you could put\nyour all the way at the top, but\n\n456\n00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.590\nit's not that important.\n\n457\n00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.050\nYour user probably wouldn't care for that.\n\n458\n00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.065\nSo we're gonna put it somewhere\nreally high, just to,\n\n459\n00:24:53.065 --> 00:24:58.506\nI can,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n460\n00:24:58.506 --> 00:25:01.740\nI have that same macro shenanigans\nI've had with the VS code.\n\n461\n00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.120\nWith me sometimes I'm like, one,\ntwo, that happened 4000 times.\n\n462\n00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n463\n00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.110\n&gt;&gt; What happened?\nCtrl-Z.\n\n464\n00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:11.030\nSo I understand your pain there, Frank.\n\n465\n00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.820\nSo if that happens to you, it's okay,\njust Ctrl-Z and try again.\n\n466\n00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.400\nI don't know why that does that, but every\nonce in a while it happens to me as well.\n\n467\n00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was interesting.\n\n468\n00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.430\nSo, we're gonna come up here,\n\n469\n00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:25.460\nwe're gonna uncomment, we're gonna\ncomment that out for right now.\n\n470\n00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.512\nDo I have?\n\n471\n00:25:26.512 --> 00:25:28.560\nNeed to put our function in there.\n\n472\n00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.640\nThere we go.\n\n473\n00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.280\nOkay, so this was the callback function,\n\n474\n00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.920\none that I had replaced with\njust an empty string for now.\n\n475\n00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.510\nSo now I just put our function in there.\n\n476\n00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.480\nAnd oop, let's not crash the site,\nshall we?\n\n477\n00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.800\nOkay, so I think we have all\nof our parameters filled in.\n\n478\n00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.070\nSo let's take a look,\nlet's refresh the page, and\n\n479\n00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.470\nlet's see if we can find our menu.\n\n480\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:59.870\nThere is my menu, and\nit has our eye that we put as the icon.\n\n481\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.810\nAnd if we were to click on it, the high\nlevel page is my random menu page.\n\n482\n00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.210\nNow usually if you're only\ncreating a single page,\n\n483\n00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.510\nyou probably don't wanna\nhave the entire menu.\n\n484\n00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.710\nYou probably wanna put it within\nthe settings or tools like we did before.\n\n485\n00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.570\nSo there's times where you probably\nwanna add another page to this menu.\n\n486\n00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.690\nAnd that is where the second\nfunction comes in.\n\n487\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.490\nAdd sub menu page.\n\n488\n00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.350\nThis page allows you to\nadd a sub page to any,\n\n489\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.840\nyou could use this to add it\nto any menu within WordPress.\n\n490\n00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.120\nBut they have these other default\nones you probably wanna use.\n\n491\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.900\nThis one's more commonly used when\nyou're defining your own menu.\n\n492\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:36.400\nSo this parent slug here\nis actually the menu.\n\n493\n00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.980\nSlug here.\n\n494\n00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.015\nSo it knows what menu to go under.\n\n495\n00:26:41.965 --> 00:26:45.169\nAnd then let's just add a random\npage title real quick, just so\n\n496\n00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:49.711\nwe can, Demo that before we go.\n\n497\n00:26:52.982 --> 00:26:55.286\nWe'll do manage options again.\n\n498\n00:27:02.647 --> 00:27:04.376\nI think I had these slides backwards.\n\n499\n00:27:08.038 --> 00:27:10.190\nMenu one goes over there\nnot the first one.\n\n500\n00:27:15.073 --> 00:27:17.500\nAnd I'll switch that in just a moment,\ngreat.\n\n501\n00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.020\nActually we'll just reuse this one.\n\n502\n00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:21.748\nJust to make it quick.\n\n503\n00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.383\nOkay.\nAnd let me double check on the order,\n\n504\n00:27:32.383 --> 00:27:34.330\nis at the parent, yeah.\n\n505\n00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:38.350\nIt's looking for the parent menu,\n\n506\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.870\nand okay, I had it right the first time.\n\n507\n00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.980\nThe problem with all these is they have\ndifferent orders on a lot of these so\n\n508\n00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.160\nyou just have to watch.\n\n509\n00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.150\nSo we'll just do intro,\nwp, menu, settings.\n\n510\n00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.420\nAlright, let's check that.\n\n511\n00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.960\nNow theoretically gonna scroll down.\n\n512\n00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.110\nAnd now we have a random page\nwithin our my menu menu.\n\n513\n00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.000\nSo just a recap on that.\n\n514\n00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.880\nYou have several different menu functions.\n\n515\n00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.260\nAnd then, depending on where you want it,\n\n516\n00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.200\ndepends on which menu\nfunction you would use.\n\n517\n00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.670\nIf you're using a default menu, you would\nfind a function such as add options page.\n\n518\n00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.630\nIf you're defining your own\nyou would use add_menu_page,\n\n519\n00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.990\nand then you'd use add_submenu_page\nto add pages to your menu.\n\n520\n00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.830\nAnd then you're gonna encounter\na variety of parameters.\n\n521\n00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.790\nYou're gonna encounter the page title or\nmenu title, that's the word or\n\n522\n00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.070\ntext that appears in the menu.\n\n523\n00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:36.740\nYou have your capabilities, which defines\nwho has permission to view your page.\n\n524\n00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.040\nYou're gonna have the menu slug,\nwhich defines the ID of the menu,\n\n525\n00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.880\nthat way you can define your menu and\nadd other pages to it.\n\n526\n00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.460\nAnd then you'll also have\nyour callback functionality,\n\n527\n00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.369\nand that's the function that handles\nwhat the contents of your page is.\n\n528\n00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.550\nDoes that all make sense, Justin?\n\n529\n00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.220\n&gt;&gt; I think I got it.\n\n530\n00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.550\nWe're adding a menu, then we add\nsub-menus by referencing that menu.\n\n531\n00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:01.160\nThese are meant to build some kind of\nthese hierarchical views that we see on\n\n532\n00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.490\nthis side menu.\n\n533\n00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.020\nHierarchical, that is the word of the day,\nI suppose.\n\n534\n00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.220\nSo I think I got it down.\n\n535\n00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.750\nAnd then the callbacks are effectively\nwhat is gonna render on the page.\n\n536\n00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.700\nI'm still getting used to the nested HTML,\nPHP\n\n537\n00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.940\nshenanigans that you pull sometimes Frank,\nbut it does look like we're coming along.\n\n538\n00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.130\nAdd I thought customizing WordPress would\nbe a little more difficult than it is,\n\n539\n00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:28.250\nbut it's seeming pretty straightforward,\nbut\n\n540\n00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.400\nwe've got a lot more\nthat we have to cover.\n\n541\n00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.490\nSo definitely stay tuned, but for\nthis episode, we're gonna head and\n\n542\n00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.320\nget out of here.\n\n543\n00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.164\nSo signing off for DevPro.TV,\nI've been your host Justin.\n\n544\n00:29:37.164 --> 00:29:38.083\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Frank Corso.\n\n545\n00:29:38.083 --> 00:29:39.802\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n546\n00:29:39.802 --> 00:29:45.405\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.945\nepisode of DevPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:18.371\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:20.840\nwe're continuing on with\nour WordPress development.\n\n6\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.370\nAnd in particular, we're going to be\nlooking at transients and options.\n\n7\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.800\nWell, those are some pretty loaded words,\nbut\n\n8\n00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.600\nluckily we have the man with the plan\nin the studio today, Mr. Frank Corso.\n\n9\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.780\nHow are you doing today Frank?\n\n10\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.070\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\nHow are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.480\n&gt;&gt; Am doing fantastic, Frank, now,\noptions and transients, outside of\n\n12\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.450\nthe realm of WordPress, those mean a bunch\nof different things to me, but what\n\n13\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.280\ndo we need to know to get started with\noptions and transients in the WordPress?\n\n14\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.480\n&gt;&gt; Well Justin,\nwhen it comes to options and transients,\n\n15\n00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.160\nwhat this is is us storing\ndata in the database.\n\n16\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.930\nSo I know there's probably many, many,\n\n17\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.520\nmany times you're going to wanna\nstore data in the database.\n\n18\n00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.170\nEverything from your theme settings,\nthe plugin settings,\n\n19\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.670\nmaybe you have a feed that you're\npulling in Twitter tweets, or\n\n20\n00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.560\nFacebook posts that you wanna display on\nyour website, and you wanna bring them in,\n\n21\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.930\nand put them in your website, and\nwanna store them in the database.\n\n22\n00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.930\nYou'll have maybe your settings for\nyour products.\n\n23\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.150\nThere's all different kinds of things\nyou'll wanna save in the database\n\n24\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.720\nthat's beyond just the custom post\ntype data that we've gone over so far.\n\n25\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.550\nThat's where options and\ntransients come in.\n\n26\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.260\nOptions is a way to store a variable or\ncollection of variables in data\n\n27\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.930\ninto the database, and transients are sort\nof like options, but they expire.\n\n28\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.330\nWe're going to go over examples for\n\n29\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.680\nboth of those in case you didn't\nquite catch the distinction there.\n\n30\n00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.650\nLet's jump to the laptop screen, and\n\n31\n00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.640\nthis is our settings page we\ncreated in the last episode.\n\n32\n00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.110\nWe created our My Menu,\n\n33\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.370\nand then we have a random page\nin it called My Random Settings.\n\n34\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.830\nAnd what we're going to do is add\na single field in a form here, and\n\n35\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.650\nwe want to save that into a database.\n\n36\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.770\nFor this particular one, we're gonna have\na setting field called favorite color and\n\n37\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.410\nthen we can put whatever\ncolor we want in there.\n\n38\n00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.580\nAnd theoretically, we can have that\ndisplayed somewhere on our website.\n\n39\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.400\nSo we're gonna hop over into our\n\n40\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.330\nrandom settings that we\ndefined In our last episode,\n\n41\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.242\nand what we are going to do is we are\ngoing to just drop in a random form here.\n\n42\n00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:25.466\nI'm just going\n\n43\n00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:33.128\nto add a form action.\n\n44\n00:02:33.128 --> 00:02:38.962\nEw and we're going\n\n45\n00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:44.430\nto label, just so\n\n46\n00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.270\nwe know what it is.\n\n47\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.885\nWe're going to hop over, and see,\nmake sure our field shows up, before we.\n\n48\n00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:54.553\nWoo!\n\n49\n00:02:54.553 --> 00:03:00.430\nRight, there is our favorite color film.\n\n50\n00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.710\nSo our goal is that we want our users to\nbe able to type in their favorite color,\n\n51\n00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.280\nand then we could use this somewhere on\nthe website, maybe as a short code that we\n\n52\n00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.420\nwanna ruin for, maybe we just\nwanna display it as a widget.\n\n53\n00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.670\nAny of those places, or anywhere else.\n\n54\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.570\nSo in this case, we're going to ignore\nany other practices that we might\n\n55\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.300\nwanna be worried about, right now we're\njust trying to worry about the options.\n\n56\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.350\nSo what we're gonna do is.\n\n57\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.513\nWe're gonna add a little bit\nof PHP in here that you may or\n\n58\n00:03:27.513 --> 00:03:28.994\nmay not have come across before.\n\n59\n00:03:28.994 --> 00:03:32.460\nWhat we're going to do is.\n\n60\n00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:43.780\n[NOISE] Also, down here.\n\n61\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.440\nAnd I'll explain this\npart in just a moment.\n\n62\n00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:08.930\nAnd Justin, before you mentioned\nnot liking PHP and HTML mixed.\n\n63\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.155\nYou'll really not care for that one.\n\n64\n00:04:10.155 --> 00:04:14.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that is one of things that.\n\n65\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.520\nI mean I understand the gist of it.\n\n66\n00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.470\nIt just takes me a little\nbit to wrap my mind around.\n\n67\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.560\nSo I was originally thinking\nthese options were just\n\n68\n00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.460\nthings that you would use to render UI but\nyou just said that I could use them for\n\n69\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.920\nshort codes or possibly other settings.\n\n70\n00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.380\nOr so they're not necessarily\nlimited to just representations of.\n\n71\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.120\nLike, I wanna choose a theme color or\nsome kinda theme base color and\n\n72\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.860\nthen everything renders around that.\n\n73\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.350\nThey can be used on options\nbased on other decision, right?\n\n74\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.850\nWhether you What menu names or\nother things of that nature, right?\n\n75\n00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes, precisesly.\n\n76\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.620\nSo if we take a step back for a moment and\ngo to one of these general setting pages\n\n77\n00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.370\nthat come with default WordPress,\nthis is all stored as options.\n\n78\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.820\nSo the site title,\n\n79\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.420\nthe tag line, the URLs, the admin email\naddress, the site language, time zone.\n\n80\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.700\nThese are all options as well.\n\n81\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.250\nAnd this is their settings page.\n\n82\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.970\nSo you can do pretty much any of this or\n\n83\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.880\nanything else you can think of\nthat gets displayed somewhere.\n\n84\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.520\nOr maybe there's an option for how many\nfooters you have or the order of your\n\n85\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.130\nnavigation or the colors,\ndifferent styles, maybe default func size.\n\n86\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.730\nAll those things could be settings or\noptions.\n\n87\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.410\nDepending on how many you have, there\nmight be other ways that we would handle\n\n88\n00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.510\nthis and we'll learn about\nthose in our future episodes.\n\n89\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.090\nBut for right now, almost any data you\nneed the user to be able to edit or modify\n\n90\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.480\nand you want stored in the database,\noptions are good a place to start.\n\n91\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.620\nDoes that sort of answer your question?\n\n92\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.760\nOkay.\nSo let's come back to our random page so\n\n93\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.440\nI can explain what I just typed here.\n\n94\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.840\nSo we'll just leave in a to do comment\nthere so we know what we're after.\n\n95\n00:05:49.324 --> 00:05:55.320\nSo what we put so far is we put\nsomething here called get option.\n\n96\n00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.650\nSo when it comes to options,\nwe need a way to get our option,\n\n97\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.100\nand save the option to the database.\n\n98\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.590\nAnd with WordPress, there's a few\ndifferent functions that come with this.\n\n99\n00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.520\nSo the first one that we're\nlooking at is get option.\n\n100\n00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.530\nSo let's go ahead and\njust take a peek at that documentation.\n\n101\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:21.060\nAnd, So we'll have get option.\n\n102\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.240\nAnd what it has is two parameters.\n\n103\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.630\nOne is a string and\nthen one is default parameter, so\n\n104\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.510\nthe first one,\nthe string is the name of the option.\n\n105\n00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.750\nSo in this case, it could be, or\nthink of if like the variable name for\n\n106\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.650\nthe value you're storing.\n\n107\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.920\nSo in this case,\nwe wanna store our favorite color.\n\n108\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.960\nSo we're calling our option\nname as favorite color,\n\n109\n00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.010\nand then we'll store the value\ninto the option favorite color.\n\n110\n00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.150\nAnd then whenever we get this,\nwe can pass a second parameter for\n\n111\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.070\nwhat the default is.\n\n112\n00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.850\nSo maybe right now we haven't\nactually saved in there.\n\n113\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.210\nSo WordPress will look for favorite color.\n\n114\n00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.290\nAnd it says hey, I can't find it so\nI'm gonna return false.\n\n115\n00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.900\nWell, maybe we want a default\nvalue to be in our box.\n\n116\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.170\nThe first time that users see this or\nanywhere else, maybe\n\n117\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.040\non the outside of the website or in a\nshortcode, if they haven't saved this yet.\n\n118\n00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.190\nWe probably want to default color or\nsomething along those lines.\n\n119\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.180\nSo we could say hey I want\nthe default to be blue.\n\n120\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.330\nAnd now, if any time WordPress is\nasked to find this favorite color and\n\n121\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.760\nit cannot find that option,\nit will return blue as the default color.\n\n122\n00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.700\nNow if we just left the parameter off,\nthen it would return false.\n\n123\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.930\nSo depending on what you're after and\nexactly what you're doing, if for example,\n\n124\n00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.290\nyou're setting an option for\n\n125\n00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.700\nhow many sidebars you want,\nmaybe you'd want to have it return false.\n\n126\n00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.290\nAnd then you can just check If it's true,\nhave this many sidebars and\n\n127\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.220\nif it's false, have that many.\n\n128\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.990\nIn this case, we want a default so\nwe'll say the default is blue.\n\n129\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.565\nSo and then what we do is we're\nstoring that into a variable color and\n\n130\n00:07:49.565 --> 00:07:52.151\nwe're putting that into\nthe input value field.\n\n131\n00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:56.261\nIf you're not quite familiar with HTML,\nif you haven't take any HTML course yet,\n\n132\n00:07:56.261 --> 00:08:00.080\nthen essentially, the value is what\ngets displayed inside the input box when\n\n133\n00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.565\nthis first page first loads.\n\n134\n00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:04.988\nSo if we go back over to our page here.\n\n135\n00:08:04.988 --> 00:08:06.607\nThe value would be default and\n\n136\n00:08:06.607 --> 00:08:09.919\nas page loads the value would\nbe what's in that box already.\n\n137\n00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.100\nSo let's take a look.\n\n138\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:16.597\nTheoretically now, we go back,\nour default should be shown as blue.\n\n139\n00:08:16.597 --> 00:08:20.260\nSo far, we have our default showing up,\nand we're retrieving the option.\n\n140\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.780\nNow we need to actually modify this and\nactually save it.\n\n141\n00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:30.054\nSo we're gonna add a save button here,\nso that's probably a good idea.\n\n142\n00:08:30.054 --> 00:08:31.923\nAnd up here what we're going to do.\n\n143\n00:08:43.472 --> 00:08:48.370\nAnd we are going to save\nthis into favorite color.\n\n144\n00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.568\nBy using the function update\noption being the transient one in\n\n145\n00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:58.208\nthere option one, to use there.\n\n146\n00:08:58.208 --> 00:08:59.757\nSo this one is update option.\n\n147\n00:08:59.757 --> 00:09:03.379\nSo what this will do, it'll look for\nthe favorite color option and\n\n148\n00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:05.326\nthen update it with your new value.\n\n149\n00:09:05.326 --> 00:09:09.714\nNow, if it didn't already exist,\nyou could use add option.\n\n150\n00:09:09.714 --> 00:09:13.584\nAnd this add option will allow you to add\nan option into the database if it does\n\n151\n00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:14.750\nnot exist.\n\n152\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.385\nHowever, the update option checks to see\nif it exists already, and if it doesn't,\n\n153\n00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:21.233\nthen it calls add option for you.\n\n154\n00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:24.005\nSo, it's very rare that you'll probably\nuse add option on its own, but\n\n155\n00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:25.850\nit's nice to know the distinction there.\n\n156\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:31.719\nSo add option adds a new one, update\nupdates an existing one or adds a new one.\n\n157\n00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:34.408\nSo, in our case,\nwe're just gonna use update, and\n\n158\n00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:37.342\nthat way if it doesn't exist\nit will call the add one, and\n\n159\n00:09:37.342 --> 00:09:40.483\nif it does exist then it'll\njust update the existing value.\n\n160\n00:09:40.483 --> 00:09:44.005\nSo in our case, what we're doing,\nis we added a save button, so\n\n161\n00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:45.980\nsomeone can save this form.\n\n162\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:52.490\nIt sends this value of favorite\ncolor into PHP's POST variable.\n\n163\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:57.339\nIf you haven't taken our RPHP course yet,\nessentially the post variable is\n\n164\n00:09:57.339 --> 00:10:02.265\none of the variables that retrieves\ndata that's being sent to that browser,\n\n165\n00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:03.876\nthat URL, that script.\n\n166\n00:10:03.876 --> 00:10:05.680\nSo, in this case,\nwe're sending it over as post.\n\n167\n00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.790\nIt's our form data,\nwe're posting data to our file so\n\n168\n00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.130\nwe're calling the favorite_color\nin the PHP global variable post.\n\n169\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.450\nNow, once we get to our episode\non sanitizing and escaping and\n\n170\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.420\nsecurity, there's gonna be a lot more we\nwanna do here to make sure this is secure.\n\n171\n00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.014\nRight now, someone could type in some\nreally malicious stuff in this value\n\n172\n00:10:27.014 --> 00:10:30.283\nfield, and they could also trick\nusers into getting to this field.\n\n173\n00:10:30.283 --> 00:10:32.820\nBut we'll touch on that in\nthe next couple episodes.\n\n174\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.740\nBut for right now, what we're after is\njust getting that data from the form,\n\n175\n00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.090\nand then saving it as the option.\n\n176\n00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.978\n&gt;&gt; Now Frank, you and\nI actually talked about that very thing.\n\n177\n00:10:40.978 --> 00:10:43.570\nThis is kind of a learning experience,\nright?\n\n178\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:48.240\nSo you keep in mind, Frank's showing\nyou how this all comes together.\n\n179\n00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.710\nYou should definitely pay attention\nto his nice little tidbits.\n\n180\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.735\nJust to let you know,\nthis is a point of code injection.\n\n181\n00:10:54.735 --> 00:10:57.221\nThat I could do all kinds\nof malicious things.\n\n182\n00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:59.447\nWe're worried about getting it working,\nbut\n\n183\n00:10:59.447 --> 00:11:03.337\nthen my understanding is we're gonna\ncircle back around and really drive home.\n\n184\n00:11:03.337 --> 00:11:06.680\nWell, this is how it works now\nlet's actually do it right.\n\n185\n00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.026\nSo, just keep in mind, getting it to work\nand then we're gonna make it better.\n\n186\n00:11:11.026 --> 00:11:12.325\n&gt;&gt; And if for whatever reason,\n\n187\n00:11:12.325 --> 00:11:15.957\nyou're just jumping right from this to\na client project, and you're not gonna\n\n188\n00:11:15.957 --> 00:11:18.840\nwatch our next few episodes\n&gt;&gt; You'll wanna look at escaping and\n\n189\n00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.830\nsanitizing in WordPress before you deploy\nsomething like this, but we'll get there.\n\n190\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.770\nSo you can sit right here and\nwe'll get that in a future episode.\n\n191\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.890\nBut for now, let's go ahead and\ntest this out and see what happens.\n\n192\n00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.658\nSo let's go ahead and refresh the page so\nwe have a save button.\n\n193\n00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:33.110\nThere's our nice little save button there.\n\n194\n00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.340\nWe're gonna change this to green.\n\n195\n00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.627\nSave and when it refreshes, now no\nmatter how many times we refresh it,\n\n196\n00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:43.384\nit shows green because that is\nwhat is saved in the database now.\n\n197\n00:11:43.384 --> 00:11:48.469\nSo just to recap what we had, we initially\ncalled get option to pull out our\n\n198\n00:11:48.469 --> 00:11:53.720\noption name favorite color, it did not\nfind one in the database initially so\n\n199\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.580\nit gave us our default of blue.\n\n200\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.136\nWhich got stored into the variable color,\n\n201\n00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:01.836\nwhich we put into the value\nof the input form.\n\n202\n00:12:01.836 --> 00:12:07.120\nWe change that to green, we hit the save\nbutton, which went up into up here.\n\n203\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.630\nWe retrieve that green value,\nsaving to a color called update option,\n\n204\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:16.307\nto update our favorite color option and\npass the new color to that option.\n\n205\n00:12:16.307 --> 00:12:18.180\nDoes that process sort of make sense,\nJustin?\n\n206\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n207\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.270\nAnd based on my previous experienced,\nI feel compelled, and\n\n208\n00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.450\nI think I've asked you about this before.\n\n209\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.710\nSo, these update options,\n\n210\n00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.680\nget option, those are actually making\ndatabase calls, from my understanding.\n\n211\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.026\nSo, at that point,\n\n212\n00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:37.117\nthe database call has to finish before\nthe remainder of that code executes.\n\n213\n00:12:37.117 --> 00:12:38.705\nAm I right in that assertion?\n\n214\n00:12:38.705 --> 00:12:43.120\nYes, so these are database calls except\nWordPress is handling all of it for you.\n\n215\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.971\nSo when you do get option it is\ncreating a MySQL statement of\n\n216\n00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:52.034\nselect this option name\nform the options table.\n\n217\n00:12:52.034 --> 00:12:54.690\nAnd then that's pulling it out and\nretrieving that value for you.\n\n218\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:59.084\nWhen you use update option it is creating\nan update SQL statement to the MySQL\n\n219\n00:12:59.084 --> 00:12:59.779\ndatabase.\n\n220\n00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:03.543\nNow the difference is there is technically\nan option caching layer during\n\n221\n00:13:03.543 --> 00:13:04.870\nthe page load.\n\n222\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.650\nSo when you load WordPress,\nit pulls out the options, and\n\n223\n00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:12.070\nwhen you do get_options, it goes\nagainst that options store that it has.\n\n224\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.965\nSo if you were to do get_option\nfavorite_color 100 times,\n\n225\n00:13:14.965 --> 00:13:16.743\nit's only gonna do that SQL call once.\n\n226\n00:13:16.743 --> 00:13:20.862\nBut is this at the page level, so it will\nhappen every time you load the page, but\n\n227\n00:13:20.862 --> 00:13:24.983\nit won't happen 100 times within that\none page cycle- But other than that,\n\n228\n00:13:24.983 --> 00:13:28.700\nthat's the only caching cycle part,\nso you'll probably want to add.\n\n229\n00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.465\nIf you have a lot of complex things here,\n\n230\n00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:33.450\nyou'll probably want to do a bit more\noptimization which we'll get to.\n\n231\n00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.685\nBut for now, for our simple case,\nthis is more than enough.\n\n232\n00:13:36.685 --> 00:13:40.160\n&gt;&gt; So what you're telling me is if I look\nfor a get option favorite color on this\n\n233\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.330\npage a hundred times, it actually just\nretrieves it one time from the database.\n\n234\n00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.130\nAnd then is says, I already have\nthatt I'll just retrieve that here.\n\n235\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.950\nFor all of the other get option calls,\nhere's that value, which is going to speed\n\n236\n00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.640\nthings up, and made a little more\nperformance just out of the box.\n\n237\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.688\nWe don't have to worry about that.\n\n238\n00:13:55.688 --> 00:13:56.908\nThat's just handled for us, right?\n\n239\n00:13:56.908 --> 00:13:58.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's all completely\nhandled by Word Press.\n\n240\n00:13:58.755 --> 00:13:59.813\nThey take care of it for us.\n\n241\n00:13:59.813 --> 00:14:00.820\nThere's nothing you have to do.\n\n242\n00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.540\nYou just have to use the option system,\ninstead of your own SQL.\n\n243\n00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.610\nSo point here.\n\n244\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.469\nWe're not gonna touch on this yet.\n\n245\n00:14:08.469 --> 00:14:13.641\nBut you can store a variety of\ndifferent variable types into options.\n\n246\n00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:15.240\nSo right now we're passing a string color.\n\n247\n00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.330\nBut you could be passing an INT or\na float or even better,\n\n248\n00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.410\nyou could be passing an array of settings.\n\n249\n00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.988\nSo we´ll get to it in\nthe next few episodes,\n\n250\n00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:24.836\nwe´re gonna have multiple\nsettings on this page.\n\n251\n00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:27.275\nWe´re gonna save all those\ninto a single array.\n\n252\n00:14:27.275 --> 00:14:30.659\nSo, we´re only taking one row in\nthe database, and we only have\n\n253\n00:14:30.659 --> 00:14:34.304\nto pull one row from the database\nwhen we want to get all our settings.\n\n254\n00:14:34.304 --> 00:14:39.077\nBut, the options this will handle, the\nserialization and the processing all that\n\n255\n00:14:39.077 --> 00:14:43.391\nfor us, we would just have to pass\nthe array to the update option function.\n\n256\n00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:46.585\nBut we'll get to that, but I just wanted\nto point out that you could pass different\n\n257\n00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:47.940\ndata types into these functions.\n\n258\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.510\nSo that is options.\n\n259\n00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.303\nWe went over update in getting the option,\nso now let's briefly touch on transients.\n\n260\n00:14:56.303 --> 00:14:57.655\nSo transients work the same way.\n\n261\n00:14:57.655 --> 00:14:59.010\nThey're pretty much the options,\n\n262\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.620\nyou have your name of your transient,\nlike favorite color.\n\n263\n00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.420\nYou pass and retrieve variables or\ndata from it.\n\n264\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.450\nExcept transients, you can say expire\nafter a certain amount of time.\n\n265\n00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.088\nOne use case of this would be retrieving\nsome sort of remote data point.\n\n266\n00:15:13.088 --> 00:15:16.960\nSo you're bringing in maybe your\nTwitter feed for your website.\n\n267\n00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.613\nBut you don't need to refresh that Twitter\nfeed every single time a page loads.\n\n268\n00:15:20.613 --> 00:15:22.658\nIn fact, that would probably\nslow your website down.\n\n269\n00:15:22.658 --> 00:15:25.130\nSo what you could do is say hey,\nI want to pull this data in.\n\n270\n00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.073\nI want to say this is an option.\n\n271\n00:15:27.073 --> 00:15:30.591\nBut then, it's just going to sit there and\nyou'll have new tweets going on, but\n\n272\n00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:32.366\nit's not going to refresh that option.\n\n273\n00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:33.992\nSo what we do is we use transients and\n\n274\n00:15:33.992 --> 00:15:36.497\nwe say hey,\nwe're going to pull this Twitter feed in.\n\n275\n00:15:36.497 --> 00:15:37.548\nWe're going to save it here.\n\n276\n00:15:37.548 --> 00:15:40.550\nWe're gonna pull from that transient\nwhenever we want to display it.\n\n277\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.826\nBut after an hour, or maybe after a day,\nI want that to expire and\n\n278\n00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:47.360\nI want to re-pull that feed in,\nthat way we have the newest version.\n\n279\n00:15:50.592 --> 00:15:53.174\nSo, I'm gonna copy and paste this in.\n\n280\n00:15:53.174 --> 00:15:55.064\nSo we're just gonna drop\nit in our settings page,\n\n281\n00:15:55.064 --> 00:16:02.093\neven though it doesn't quite makes sense\nto have it there, that way Some of\n\n282\n00:16:02.093 --> 00:16:06.391\nthis we haven't gone over yet, we're gonna\ngo over some of the remote and response.\n\n283\n00:16:06.391 --> 00:16:08.740\nThings, in a future episode,\nbut right now,\n\n284\n00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.799\nwe're going to look at the transients.\n\n285\n00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:13.600\nSo if we look here,\nwe have a get_transient, and\n\n286\n00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.400\nwe're pointing it to\na value of FC contributors.\n\n287\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.580\nSo in this case, what get_transient does,\n\n288\n00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.060\nis almost the same thing as\nour get_option does up here.\n\n289\n00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.760\nIt looks for a transient with this name,\nand then it returns that value.\n\n290\n00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.622\nWhereas right now we could pass\na default to the get_option,\n\n291\n00:16:30.622 --> 00:16:33.800\nthe get_transient is gonna return\nfalse if it does not exist.\n\n292\n00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.640\nAnd this is a good way for us to know\nif we need to refresh that feed because\n\n293\n00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.992\nafter, if we had set this to an hour, like\nthe Twitter feed, once it expired this\n\n294\n00:16:41.992 --> 00:16:45.960\nwould then return false, so we'll\nknow to go refresh that Twitter feed.\n\n295\n00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:52.588\nNow this little part here, we're not\ngonna quite go over in this episode but\n\n296\n00:16:52.588 --> 00:16:54.460\nwhat this is just getting us that feed.\n\n297\n00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.970\nWe're just gonna get a feed\nof GitHub group contributors.\n\n298\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.820\nSo we'll go over that part\nin a future episode, but\n\n299\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.530\nright now we're just gonna get that data,\nfor our transient, and\n\n300\n00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.950\nthen we're gonna go right\nhere to our set_transient.\n\n301\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.030\nAnd this is almost like the update_option\nwe used with the options, but\n\n302\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.670\nthis is a little bit different.\n\n303\n00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.258\nSo update_option, you would pass\nthe option name and the value.\n\n304\n00:17:16.258 --> 00:17:20.070\nWhereas with set_transient,\nyou pass the transient name and\n\n305\n00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:24.230\nthen you pass the value, but\nthen you also pass a final parameter and\n\n306\n00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.770\nthis is how long you want this\ntransient to exist in seconds.\n\n307\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.246\nSo in this case,\nI want it to last one hour.\n\n308\n00:17:32.246 --> 00:17:34.980\nSo 66, yes, one hour.\n\n309\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.840\nSo what this will do is it\nwill store it into options and\n\n310\n00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.280\ngo, hey,\nafter an hour I'm gonna delete them.\n\n311\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.020\nSo once it's stored,\nwhen we come back up here,\n\n312\n00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.190\nour get_transient is going\nto return that to us.\n\n313\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.370\nSo we'll have this value, whatever value\nwe stored into it, but then after an hour,\n\n314\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.830\nit'll return false.\n\n315\n00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.890\nSo we will know, hey it's time for\nus to once again refresh this speed.\n\n316\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.410\nSo let's take a look real quick.\n\n317\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.020\nI think that's ready to go.\n\n318\n00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.872\nSo we're gonna come over here.\n\n319\n00:17:59.872 --> 00:18:01.487\nSave, yes.\n\n320\n00:18:01.487 --> 00:18:04.713\nAnd if I go for.\n\n321\n00:18:04.713 --> 00:18:09.440\nWe're gonna hop over here, let it refresh.\n\n322\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.100\nSo we're just loaded in.\n\n323\n00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.040\nIt took a second to load in the feed but,\ntheoretically,\n\n324\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.880\nthe next time we refresh it,\nit's going to go a little bit faster,\n\n325\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.930\nbecause it doesn't have\nto refresh that feed.\n\n326\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.370\nSo I just brought in a list of\ncontributors through one of the plugins\n\n327\n00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.240\nI work on, and this is now saved\nas an array in a transient.\n\n328\n00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.000\nAnd I have this useful plugin\ncalled Transient Manager.\n\n329\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.856\nWe can open up here.\n\n330\n00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:33.930\nWe can come over here.\n\n331\n00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:38.070\nAnd this gives us all the transients\nthat are currently in the database.\n\n332\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.670\nAnd we can look here, there´s our FC\ncontributors, there´s an array in it,\n\n333\n00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.790\nand it expires in 60 minutes.\n\n334\n00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.520\nSo once this expires,\nit'll have to reload that feed.\n\n335\n00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.235\nBut it won´t reload the feed every\nsingle time we load the page.\n\n336\n00:18:48.235 --> 00:18:52.140\nIt'll just pull from the database,\nuntil it expires.\n\n337\n00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.390\nSo if we were to come over here and\nclick delete, and now it no longer exists.\n\n338\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.840\nThen we refresh this page again,\n\n339\n00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.160\nit might take an extra few seconds to\npull in that data from GitHub again.\n\n340\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.270\nNow when we come back to it,\nit'll reappear.\n\n341\n00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.280\nDoes that extra step in the options\nsort of make sense there?\n\n342\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.190\n&gt;&gt; So this is something that may not\nnecessarily always be at the forefront\n\n343\n00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.908\nof your mind, but If you have something\nthat takes a real long time right.\n\n344\n00:19:15.908 --> 00:19:17.600\nWe're showing GitHub contributors,\n\n345\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.000\nwhich not on huge payload\nof data in this context.\n\n346\n00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.050\nBut it could be a large amount of data.\n\n347\n00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.740\nAn RSS feed,\nyou need to do some processing.\n\n348\n00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.740\nAnd let's say this is something\nthat takes a little bit of time.\n\n349\n00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.758\nTakes a little bit of resources, but\nit doesn't need to be done that often.\n\n350\n00:19:31.758 --> 00:19:32.485\nRight?\n\n351\n00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:37.160\nThere's no purpose in doing it every time\nthe page loads, especially if you're\n\n352\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.150\nbuilding like a dash, let's just call this\na dashboard, for lack of a better term.\n\n353\n00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.320\nDo it once.\n\n354\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.140\nFigure out what is a best balance\nbetween expiration times.\n\n355\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.340\nSet it as a transient.\n\n356\n00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.600\nThat way, you get fast load times.\n\n357\n00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.380\nAnd then you also get the most up to date\ninformation based on your requirements.\n\n358\n00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.040\nThis is very much context based.\n\n359\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.810\nI've done, not in WordPress, but I've\ndone things like this using Memcache or\n\n360\n00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.940\nRedis or\nthings like that where I'm cashing\n\n361\n00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.210\nthings I need fast that take a little\nwhile to maybe calculate or retrieve.\n\n362\n00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.730\nBut they don't update a whole lot, so\nI am going to grab those quickly and\n\n363\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.447\nthen have some other scheduled job or\nsome other resource.\n\n364\n00:20:16.447 --> 00:20:20.897\nIn this case that's actually internal of\nthe page load, the page load says if it's\n\n365\n00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:24.620\nnot there, go ahead and get it or\nwe'll pay that price on page load.\n\n366\n00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.930\nBut there's a bunch of different ways\nthat you can make use of transients.\n\n367\n00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.580\nNow I do have a question about this.\n\n368\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.120\nIs this using the MySQL database to\nstore those transient values as well,\n\n369\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.320\nin this caching layer?\n\n370\n00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nthese transients are stored, still,\n\n371\n00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.390\nin the work reference database system.\n\n372\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.225\nAnd they handle all the SQL using this,\nand then they pull and\n\n373\n00:20:42.225 --> 00:20:43.900\nretrieve from the my SQL database.\n\n374\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.574\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nI didn't know if WordPress had some other,\n\n375\n00:20:46.574 --> 00:20:48.450\nlike underlying data store layer.\n\n376\n00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:49.310\nI just wanted to make sure.\n\n377\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.490\nIt looks like everything is,\nwell, in my SQL land.\n\n378\n00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.790\nSo is that all we need to know\nabout options and transients?\n\n379\n00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.540\n&gt;&gt; Well just say,\nI had a few extra examples there.\n\n380\n00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.670\nThere might be a time when it's\nnot always about a remote URL.\n\n381\n00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.300\nMaybe there's some sort of processing or\nalgorithm within your website.\n\n382\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.080\nSo if you have an e-commerce store and\nyou wanna calculate the daily total, or\n\n383\n00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.500\nhow much revenue you've done in a day or a\nmonth, transients would be a good use for\n\n384\n00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.100\nthat because you don't need to\ncalculate at every single page load.\n\n385\n00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.805\nIt could be every hour or every 15\nminutes or something along those lines.\n\n386\n00:21:17.805 --> 00:21:22.130\nSo you could come down this page,\nif it's false, run these algorithms or\n\n387\n00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.890\ncalculations that take several seconds to\nrun, and then store it as a transient.\n\n388\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.530\nAnd that way it only happens\nevery set amount of time,\n\n389\n00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.860\ninstead of every page load.\n\n390\n00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.410\nSo it might not always\nbe some remote feed,\n\n391\n00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:35.070\nit might be some sort of processing that\nyou can eliminate on your own website.\n\n392\n00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.830\n&gt;&gt; And Frank,\n\n393\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.330\nthat's something that you and\nI talked about outside of the episodes.\n\n394\n00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.465\nWe've done some data science stuff.\n\n395\n00:21:42.465 --> 00:21:45.670\nWhen you're doing data analysis,\nsometimes those just take time.\n\n396\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.700\nYou're gonna do something\nlike a batch process.\n\n397\n00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.060\nBut it maybe it needs to be in a report or\nin a dashboard.\n\n398\n00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.490\nGreat use case for transients.\n\n399\n00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.720\nSo if it was misconstrued by what I said,\n\n400\n00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.270\nthat it's always some kind of\nnetwork call, that's not the case.\n\n401\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.090\nIt could be calculation-based.\n\n402\n00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.530\nSo thank you so much.\n\n403\n00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.228\nNow we do have a lot more to work\non with that transient part.\n\n404\n00:22:05.228 --> 00:22:06.410\nRight?\nWe just saw an example.\n\n405\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.540\nWe see how it works, but\nwe really need to dig in and\n\n406\n00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.070\nunderstand how all this comes together.\n\n407\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.200\nAnd I think that's gonna\ntake a few more episodes.\n\n408\n00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.720\nSo definitely stay tuned.\n\n409\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.020\nBut for this episode we're gonna\ngo ahead and get out of here.\n\n410\n00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.080\nSo signing off for DevProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n411\n00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.780\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Frank Corso.\n\n412\n00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.919\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n413\n00:22:24.919 --> 00:22:30.333\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

DevProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:20.585\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\ncontinuing on with WordPress development.\n\n4\n00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:26.019\nAnd well, we're gonna be looking into\nthe settings page, sections, and fields.\n\n5\n00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.870\nAnd well, luckily, we have a very special\nperson back in the studio to help us\n\n6\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.150\nout with just that thing, Mr. Frank Corso.\n\n7\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.460\nHow are you doing today, Frank?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well,\n\n8\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.710\nhow are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Frank.\n\n9\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.034\nNow, settings, sections, and fields,\nthat's the title of this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:43.037\nHowever, that's a lot of words,\nand really,\n\n11\n00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:47.917\nwhat are we concerning ourselves with\nconcerning settings, sections, and\n\n12\n00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:50.495\nfields?\n&gt;&gt; So when it comes to WordPress,\n\n13\n00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:52.960\nwe looked at in a previous\nepisode about our settings page.\n\n14\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.630\nAnd we have our settings page,\nwe had our favorite color in there.\n\n15\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.790\nAnd you'll probably wanna do a lot\nmore with your plugin or theme or\n\n16\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.520\nyour website than adding a single favorite\ncolors option somewhere on your website.\n\n17\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.250\nRealistically, you're probably gonna have\na settings page with multiple options in\n\n18\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.710\nit that you wanna to tweak and\ndo things with.\n\n19\n00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.380\nSo this is where WordPress'\nsettings system allows us to\n\n20\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.415\nbuild out these forms and fields and\noptions, using their fairly\n\n21\n00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:22.110\nuser-friendly functions that we can just\ncall, and they will do it all for you.\n\n22\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.070\nThat way, your UI matches\nthe rest of the WordPress UI, and\n\n23\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.610\nthey handle a lot of the actual\nprocessing and storing and manipulation.\n\n24\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.110\nSo let's jump to the laptop screen,\nand we'll take a look.\n\n25\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.340\nSo before, we had our favorite color,\nI removed the transient part of this page.\n\n26\n00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.230\nSo that way, we can clear down and\ntake a look at what we're working with.\n\n27\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.980\nSo right now, we have our favorite color.\n\n28\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.650\nRealistically, though,\n\n29\n00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.240\nyou'll probably have a few different\noptions in your settings page.\n\n30\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.270\nIf you have a theme, you're probably gonna\nhave an entire page of maybe padding and\n\n31\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.020\nsidebars and footers and various things.\n\n32\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.530\nIf you have a plugin, maybe you'll have a\nfew different things for an email address,\n\n33\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.060\na from name, an email address to email to,\nthe size things.\n\n34\n00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.360\nMaybe email contents or\nsettings or questions or quizzes.\n\n35\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.360\nThere's just so\nmany different settings you could have.\n\n36\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.310\nAnd maybe you don't wanna have to build\nup the entire form and try to match\n\n37\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.070\nit to the UI and figure out how you're\ngonna save all this and process it.\n\n38\n00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.400\nWordPress will take care\nof all of that for you.\n\n39\n00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.191\nSo the first function we wanna look at,\nsomething called register_settings.\n\n40\n00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:17.623\nSo before we had our option,\nwe had our favorite color.\n\n41\n00:02:17.623 --> 00:02:20.637\nWe're gonna take it a little higher,\nand we're gonna go,\n\n42\n00:02:20.637 --> 00:02:23.730\nwe're just gonna call it fc_settings,\nright?\n\n43\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.980\nSo we have an option called fc_settings,\nand inside that\n\n44\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.450\noption of fc_settings is where all of\nour settings are gonna be contained.\n\n45\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.530\nAnd how WordPress handles this is that it\nputs all of your settings together and\n\n46\n00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.590\nthen stores them as an array into\nthis option called fc_settings.\n\n47\n00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.165\nSo before we had a single value of\na color inside our option favorite_color.\n\n48\n00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:47.462\nBut now we're gonna have an array of\nsettings stored into our general settings\n\n49\n00:02:47.462 --> 00:02:47.990\noption.\n\n50\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.558\nAnd what WordPress does is, using this\nregister setting function, we can register\n\n51\n00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:59.690\nthose settings into a group, that we then\ndisplay as a form on our settings page.\n\n52\n00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.930\nNow, if that doesn't quite make sense,\nonce we start using it,\n\n53\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.180\nit'll start making\na little bit more sense.\n\n54\n00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.608\nSo we're going to copy and\npaste this over.\n\n55\n00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:10.109\nNow the args, we're not gonna\nuse in this particular one,\n\n56\n00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.420\ncuz it starts getting\na little bit more advanced.\n\n57\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.030\nBut just so you can see what it can do,\n\n58\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.020\nyou can do a lot of\nother things with this.\n\n59\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.310\nYou can register these into the REST API,\nyou can add descriptions and type of data,\n\n60\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.130\nand you can do a lot of\nmanipulation with this.\n\n61\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.400\nFor this particular one,\n\n62\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.468\nwe're gonna leave that off just\nto keep things simple for now.\n\n63\n00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:30.943\nSo we're gonna hop over here,\nand where was that at,\n\n64\n00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:34.905\nwe, Where are we gonna put this?\n\n65\n00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:36.614\nLet's go ahead and\nput this in here for now.\n\n66\n00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:52.380\nAnd what we're gonna do,\nI'll explain this part in just a moment.\n\n67\n00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.500\nBut what we're gonna do\nis hook into another hook\n\n68\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.521\nof WordPress called admin_init.\n\n69\n00:04:01.522 --> 00:04:06.051\nSo let me make sure I set this right,\nadmin, yeah.\n\n70\n00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:13.555\nAnd then, let me rename these parameters\nand then I'll explain this part.\n\n71\n00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:21.015\nWhat, and we are calling this fc_settings.\n\n72\n00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.600\nWe're gonna remove the args.\n\n73\n00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.600\nSo what this is, is we have a function\nwe're gonna use to set up all\n\n74\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.160\nthe settings we're gonna\nbe setting up right now.\n\n75\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.710\nWe're gonna put this inside this\nfunction called fc_setup_settings and\n\n76\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.250\nwe're gonna hook this into admin_init.\n\n77\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.169\nSo previously we created our menu and\nwe hooked it into admin_menu.\n\n78\n00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.730\nAnd now we're setting up the settings and\nwe're hooking this into admin_init.\n\n79\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.803\nThis is one of the best practices,\n\n80\n00:04:44.803 --> 00:04:48.173\nthere's technically a variety\nof ways you could do it.\n\n81\n00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:52.583\nBut for the most part, if we had,\nI don't think I have the settings API yet.\n\n82\n00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:55.641\nBut as WordPress goes through and it\nloads all of its different functions and\n\n83\n00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:57.230\nall the different themes and plugins.\n\n84\n00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.500\nOnce it gets to admin_init, that's where\nmost of the plugins and themes are set up.\n\n85\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.638\nAnd it's beginning to initialize\nthe admin pages, and so\n\n86\n00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:07.950\nthat's where it is expecting you\nto have your settings registered.\n\n87\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.860\nAnd that way it knows, hey,\n\n88\n00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.130\nthese are the settings we might\nbe using throughout this system.\n\n89\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.230\nSo for us, we're registering the setting,\n\n90\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.640\nwhich is the function\nthat we looked at here.\n\n91\n00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.890\nAnd what the group is, it's saying,\nhey, we're gonna be creating a form.\n\n92\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.611\nAnd we're gonna be having a lot of\ndifferent settings and functions and\n\n93\n00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:25.075\nthings going on in the settings page.\n\n94\n00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:29.839\nSo this group is our identifier for\nthe contents going on in that form,\n\n95\n00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:33.813\nand then we're attaching it\nto our option fc_settings.\n\n96\n00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.933\nAnd once we have that, we're gonna\ncome over here to this other function,\n\n97\n00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:41.430\nI'm just gonna basically explain\nthose parameters real quick.\n\n98\n00:05:42.848 --> 00:05:47.210\nSo the add_settings section then allows\nus to add a section within that form.\n\n99\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.580\nFor a general overview,\n\n100\n00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.450\nthe fc_settings groups is sort of\nlike the form of your settings page.\n\n101\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.830\nThere can be a lot more\nother things in there.\n\n102\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.878\nFor right now, we're just gonna\nsee it as the general form, and\n\n103\n00:05:58.878 --> 00:06:00.640\nthis section is one of the sections.\n\n104\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.278\nSo on the settings page,\nyou could have a main settings, and\n\n105\n00:06:03.278 --> 00:06:04.640\nthen maybe an email settings.\n\n106\n00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.655\nYou could have two separate settings\nusing this add_settings_section.\n\n107\n00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.720\nSo for example, we're just gonna call\nit main settings, main settings.\n\n108\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.490\nThen we're gonna come over here,\n\n109\n00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.900\nwe're gonna call this\nthe fc_settings_section as the ID.\n\n110\n00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.980\nScroll over here, we'll create\na function in just a moment for that.\n\n111\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:34.000\nBut then this page is actually\nthe page slug of your settings page.\n\n112\n00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.860\nSo if you recall up here,\nwe had our intro_wp_menu_settings page.\n\n113\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.378\nIt is that slug because we want this,\noops.\n\n114\n00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:48.449\nTry that again, I'm guessing there's\na keyboard shortcut to make that,\n\n115\n00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.290\nhere, maybe?\n\n116\n00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.330\nThere it goes, Visual Studio code has\nsome fun keyboard shortcuts there.\n\n117\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.741\n&gt;&gt; I can provide some guide,\n\n118\n00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:01.380\nI'm pretty sure it's Ctrl+B.\n&gt;&gt; Is what opens that panel back and\n\n119\n00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.680\nforth?\n&gt;&gt; And Ctrl+V is paste, and well,\n\n120\n00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.750\nif you look down at your keyboard,\nthey're right next to each other.\n\n121\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.569\nAnd sometimes we just fat finger things,\nhappens, well.\n\n122\n00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:15.981\nThere's a lot of things I seem to need to\nkeep track of when I'm wiring this up,\n\n123\n00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:18.200\nand we're not even finished.\n\n124\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.468\nSo I need to give it\nsome kind of group name.\n\n125\n00:07:22.468 --> 00:07:23.154\n&gt;&gt; Let me scroll this down a little bit.\n\n126\n00:07:23.154 --> 00:07:26.798\n&gt;&gt; So this fc_settings_group and\n\n127\n00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:31.820\nfc_settings, let me back up a little bit.\n\n128\n00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.403\nfc_settings_group, that is the name, and\n\n129\n00:07:36.403 --> 00:07:41.787\nthen fc_settings is the function.\n&gt;&gt; So, you have it a little backwards,\n\n130\n00:07:41.787 --> 00:07:45.990\nso fc_settings_group is what identifies\nour group of settings that we're creating.\n\n131\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.064\nAll our fields in our form,\n\n132\n00:07:47.064 --> 00:07:49.510\nthat's gonna be the identifier\nthat we're gonna hook into.\n\n133\n00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.971\nThe fc_settings is the actual option\nthat the data's gonna be stored into.\n\n134\n00:07:53.971 --> 00:07:57.046\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, and then we're gonna\n\n135\n00:07:57.046 --> 00:08:01.846\nadd a section to the settings\ncalled fc_settings_section.\n\n136\n00:08:01.846 --> 00:08:07.799\nAnd it's gonna have a title of Main\nSettings, but then that's going to be on,\n\n137\n00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:11.678\nI'm telling it it's gonna\nshow up on the sub menu,\n\n138\n00:08:11.678 --> 00:08:15.241\nintro WP menu settings.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna appear right here on\n\n139\n00:08:15.241 --> 00:08:17.393\nour My random settings.\n&gt;&gt; Well it's on this particular page.\n\n140\n00:08:17.393 --> 00:08:19.457\nYou're telling it what page it is, but\n\n141\n00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:22.111\nin our example it is that sub menu page,\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n142\n00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:23.020\n&gt;&gt; Got you, okay.\n\n143\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.885\nAll right,\nI got it all squared away in my head now.\n\n144\n00:08:24.885 --> 00:08:28.792\n[LAUGH] I think I'm okay\nwith moving forward\n\n145\n00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:29.650\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n146\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.240\nso I'm gonna just refer back to\nmy notes there for a second.\n\n147\n00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.618\nAnd then we're gonna come over here.\n\n148\n00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:38.258\nWe're going to create a new function,\n\n149\n00:08:38.258 --> 00:08:41.497\nfc_generate_section.\n\n150\n00:08:45.472 --> 00:08:47.050\nAnd some stuff.\n\n151\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.300\nSo what you can do with that\nsection is you can output.\n\n152\n00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.782\nUsing the callback function,\n\n153\n00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:56.140\nyou can output something at\nthe beginning of that section.\n\n154\n00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.560\nSo in it we have our Main Settings, maybe\nyou wanna have some identification text\n\n155\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.740\nexplaining what that section\nof settings will do.\n\n156\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.848\nSo if you had email settings, you could\nhave a paragraph element, like I put here,\n\n157\n00:09:05.848 --> 00:09:08.150\nsaying hey,\nthis controls our admin emails.\n\n158\n00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.130\nOr this controls the themes, colors,\nor things along those lines.\n\n159\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.292\nYou can add some information there and\nyou can also have things manipulate\n\n160\n00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:17.060\nbased on if it's been saved or\nnot, or if there's an error.\n\n161\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.351\nYou could do things like\nthat in this section.\n\n162\n00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:20.070\nFor us that's beyond what\nwe're gonna go over right now.\n\n163\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.670\nBut I just wanted to put something in\nthere so we can see how that works.\n\n164\n00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:28.855\nAnd then lastly we're going to come\nover to the very last one called\n\n165\n00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:30.550\nadd_settings_field.\n\n166\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.206\nSo what we're gonna do,\nI'm just gonna paste it in here, and\n\n167\n00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:34.749\nthen we will go over this together.\n\n168\n00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:36.630\nSo let me go all the way back.\n\n169\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.804\nAnd I'm gonna put these on\na few extra lines here so\n\n170\n00:09:39.804 --> 00:09:41.930\nwe can see how all this plays out.\n\n171\n00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.720\nSo we have our id.\n\n172\n00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.980\nAnd as you can imagine,\nthis is going to be the id of the field.\n\n173\n00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.631\nSo we're gonna just call\nthis something random, so\n\n174\n00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:54.360\nthis is gonna be our fc_favorite_color,\nI guess.\n\n175\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.907\nFavorite_color_field.\n\n176\n00:09:56.907 --> 00:10:01.580\nAnd then we have our title and\nthis is what's gonna be shown to the user.\n\n177\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.186\nSo right here on our settings page\nwe have our favorite color label.\n\n178\n00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:08.990\nThis title is what will be the label\nof the field once it gets defined.\n\n179\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.490\nSo what is your favorite color?\n\n180\n00:10:14.665 --> 00:10:19.153\nAnd then we'll get back to this\nfunction in just a moment.\n\n181\n00:10:19.153 --> 00:10:20.889\nAnd then here is our page again.\n\n182\n00:10:20.889 --> 00:10:27.460\nSo we're gonna hit our page slug for\nwhere we want it, and drop it in here.\n\n183\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:32.518\nAnd then our settings, we say we want\nit on that page in this section.\n\n184\n00:10:32.518 --> 00:10:36.996\nYeah, we are not gonna do\nthe extra arguments right now,\n\n185\n00:10:36.996 --> 00:10:39.430\njust to save us an extra thing.\n\n186\n00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.854\nBut just a glance at the documentation\nto show you what you could do\n\n187\n00:10:42.854 --> 00:10:44.355\nwith these extra optional.\n\n188\n00:10:44.355 --> 00:10:45.310\nIs you change a label,\n\n189\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.940\nin addition to the description\nyou can also add classes to it.\n\n190\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.625\nSo that's a little bit beyond scope,\n\n191\n00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:52.160\nwe're gonna try to keep it\nsimple in this example.\n\n192\n00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.234\nBut you could add some extra arguments and\nparameters to that field.\n\n193\n00:10:56.234 --> 00:10:56.841\n&gt;&gt; Now Frank,\n\n194\n00:10:56.841 --> 00:11:00.980\nit seems there's one of those arguments\nthat seems a little redundant, right?\n\n195\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:07.050\nThe page, so you're adding this to a\nsection that already knows about the page.\n\n196\n00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.980\nBut we also have to tell the section about\nthe page that it's going to reside in.\n\n197\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.902\nAm I seeing that correctly?\n\n198\n00:11:12.902 --> 00:11:16.183\nAm I understanding that correctly?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\n\n199\n00:11:16.183 --> 00:11:18.855\nthere's a few redundancies here.\n\n200\n00:11:18.855 --> 00:11:21.150\nOne in the add_settings_section.\n\n201\n00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.516\nIn a second we're gonna use a function to\ntell WordPress where that sections go.\n\n202\n00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:26.576\nBut yet\nwe still have to attach the page to it.\n\n203\n00:11:26.576 --> 00:11:27.810\nAnd then same thing with\nthe settings_field.\n\n204\n00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.570\nWe're saying it's gonna be in a section,\nwhich already knows where it's going.\n\n205\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.489\nWhich it already will know when\nit's going when we call it, but\n\n206\n00:11:33.489 --> 00:11:34.773\nthen we still have to\npatch the page to it.\n\n207\n00:11:34.773 --> 00:11:36.189\nIt's one of those redundancies.\n\n208\n00:11:36.189 --> 00:11:38.249\nI don't have a really\ngood explanation of why.\n\n209\n00:11:38.249 --> 00:11:41.620\nIt's just how WordPress was built\nover time as they added new features.\n\n210\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.802\nBut it's one of those things that you will\nhave to pay attention to just in case,\n\n211\n00:11:44.802 --> 00:11:47.762\ncuz if these don't quite match up,\nyou might run into some errors there.\n\n212\n00:11:47.762 --> 00:11:50.818\nSo now we just have our example,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n213\n00:11:50.818 --> 00:11:53.675\nadd a new function to\nactually show this field.\n\n214\n00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:59.328\nSo we're gonna say\nfavorite_color_field as our function.\n\n215\n00:11:59.328 --> 00:12:06.435\nAnd we will call it in the callback\nfunction, if I can paste right.\n\n216\n00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:10.270\nLet's try that again, copy,\nin our callback parameter.\n\n217\n00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.662\nAnd so inside here, I'm just gonna\ncopy and paste something for\n\n218\n00:12:14.662 --> 00:12:17.415\nnow, and\nthen we'll touch on that in just a moment.\n\n219\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.753\nOkay, so this is from one of my plugins.\n\n220\n00:12:26.753 --> 00:12:30.660\nI'm just copy and paste it in so\nwe didn't have to go back and forth.\n\n221\n00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.064\nSo let me drop in what we're doing.\n\n222\n00:12:32.064 --> 00:12:36.293\nSo when we have our add_settings_field and\nthis callback function,\n\n223\n00:12:36.293 --> 00:12:40.170\nfc_favorite_color_field, when\nit goes to load that field,\n\n224\n00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.460\nit's gonna call this function.\n\n225\n00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.330\nAnd this is how you decide what the form\nfield input type will look like and\n\n226\n00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.740\nwhat it will consist of.\n\n227\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.847\nSo you can have a drop down box,\nyou could have a check box,\n\n228\n00:12:50.847 --> 00:12:51.932\nyou could have an input type.\n\n229\n00:12:51.932 --> 00:12:54.300\nYou could have numbers and texts,\nyou could have date boxes.\n\n230\n00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.010\nYou can do whatever you're wanting for\nthis field.\n\n231\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.940\nAnd but you would decide that\nin this callback function.\n\n232\n00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.115\nSo right now, what we're going\nto do is rename this part.\n\n233\n00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:06.018\nSee if we don't lose ourselves.\n\n234\n00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:12.923\nAnd what we're going to do is\nwe're going to output a text box,\n\n235\n00:13:12.923 --> 00:13:15.828\njust like the one we had before.\n\n236\n00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:21.817\nAnd what we're gonna do is\nrename this to color and\n\n237\n00:13:21.817 --> 00:13:26.120\nwe're gonna call it, say, blue.\n\n238\n00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.495\nAnd I'll explain this\narray in just a moment.\n\n239\n00:13:28.495 --> 00:13:34.478\nLet me go ahead and\ntype all these out and drop this in.\n\n240\n00:13:34.478 --> 00:13:37.632\nOkay, so\nwhat we wanna do is have a default.\n\n241\n00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:44.290\nAnd before, if you recall, when we did\nget_option, we could say a default.\n\n242\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.790\nBut now, now that we have all of our\ndifferent options stored in to an array,\n\n243\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.880\nit's a little harder to have a default.\n\n244\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.590\nSo that's where this\nlittle process comes in.\n\n245\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.980\nWe get to the field, we wanna call our\nget_option, get all of our settings out.\n\n246\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.578\nSo we call in our fc_settings, that's\nwhere all of our settings are going to be.\n\n247\n00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:03.060\nAnd we're gonna set the default to blue.\n\n248\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.723\nAnd then we're gonna check and\nmake sure our color parameter, or\n\n249\n00:14:06.723 --> 00:14:09.330\nour color index inside our settings,\nis set.\n\n250\n00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.580\nAnd if it's not, or if it is,\nwe wanna pull that instead.\n\n251\n00:14:14.613 --> 00:14:16.580\nSo we'll just step back a moment.\n\n252\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.980\nWe have our settings array and\nour fc_settings option.\n\n253\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.760\nAnd inside that array,\nwe're going to have one of our settings,\n\n254\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.090\nwhich is our favorite color.\n\n255\n00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.060\nNow theoretically,\nwe could have multiple ones in there.\n\n256\n00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.570\nWe could have a favorite color.\n\n257\n00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.150\nWe could have the site title.\nWe could have email address, phone, name.\n\n258\n00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.217\nYou could have all of those and\nthese would be different indexes,\n\n259\n00:14:32.217 --> 00:14:34.125\ndifferent elements inside your array.\n\n260\n00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:37.300\nIn our case, we're just gonna have one for\nright now and we're gonna call it color.\n\n261\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.670\nAnd that's what we're doing in these first\nfew lines is retrieving that color or\n\n262\n00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.040\nsetting the default if\nit didn't already exist.\n\n263\n00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.660\nNow underneath it is where\nwe're echoing out our field.\n\n264\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.260\nNow this could be anything.\n\n265\n00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.307\nIt could be a select box.\n\n266\n00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:52.040\nIt could be a checkbox.\n\n267\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.360\nIt could be a textarea,\nwhatever you wanted to put in here.\n\n268\n00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.200\nBut the key parts that we want\nto look is the name and the id.\n\n269\n00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.155\nYou'll notice this looks like an array,\nbecause it is.\n\n270\n00:15:01.155 --> 00:15:06.070\nSo this name, the name, and the id,\nis going to line up with your settings.\n\n271\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.120\nAnd then the index is gonna line up\nwith the index of your settings.\n\n272\n00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.438\nSo in our case, let me just scroll down\njust a hair so make sure everyone can see.\n\n273\n00:15:13.438 --> 00:15:16.300\nSo in our case, we have our settings.\n\n274\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.550\nAnd there's an index of color.\n\n275\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.260\nAnd that is going to line up with the name\nand id of whatever field you create.\n\n276\n00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.655\nIf it's a textarea, a select box,\na checkbox, text box, a number,\n\n277\n00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:31.990\nany of those lines, that will line up with\nthe indexes and settings of your option.\n\n278\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:37.745\nAnd then last but not least, we're gonna\noutput the color, like we had done before.\n\n279\n00:15:37.745 --> 00:15:40.970\nAnd then we're going to save it.\n\n280\n00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.740\nOkay, so we have our field,\nwe have our settings.\n\n281\n00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.495\nWe've registered our settings.\n\n282\n00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:47.279\nNow it's time to actually display this.\n\n283\n00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:51.940\nSo we are gonna scroll down\nback to our original page.\n\n284\n00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.726\nSo here's our original page.\n\n285\n00:15:52.726 --> 00:15:54.970\nWe have our random settings, header,\nwe're gonna keep that for now.\n\n286\n00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.158\nWe have this if is set thing.\n\n287\n00:15:57.158 --> 00:15:59.918\nWe're gonna actually remove all that\nbecause WordPress is now taking care\n\n288\n00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:00.500\nof that for us.\n\n289\n00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.237\nWe're gonna remove the form because\nWordPress is gonna take care of\n\n290\n00:16:03.237 --> 00:16:03.773\nthat for us.\n\n291\n00:16:03.773 --> 00:16:07.695\nAnd I'm gonna hop over here and just\ncopy and paste something one more time.\n\n292\n00:16:07.695 --> 00:16:08.986\nOver here.\n\n293\n00:16:11.478 --> 00:16:14.120\nAnd copy and paste one of these.\n\n294\n00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.410\nDrop it right there.\n\n295\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:16.540\nSo we're gonna have our form again.\n\n296\n00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.160\nBut this time instead of the action\njust posting it to itself and\n\n297\n00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.728\nus handling all of it,\naction is gonna send to options.php.\n\n298\n00:16:23.728 --> 00:16:26.602\nAnd this is one of WordPress's\nsystems where the options for\n\n299\n00:16:26.602 --> 00:16:30.486\nall these functions we're building,\nit knows, hey, if anything is sent here,\n\n300\n00:16:30.486 --> 00:16:33.100\nthis is probably a settings\nbased on our settings API.\n\n301\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.081\nAnd it'll handle whatever you're\nsending to it if you're using their\n\n302\n00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:38.350\nsettings functions.\n\n303\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.370\nSo the settings field,\nI need to rename it to our group.\n\n304\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.274\nLet's see, where was our group at?\n\n305\n00:16:45.274 --> 00:16:46.080\nI'm gonna scroll down here.\n\n306\n00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.210\nReplace our group.\n\n307\n00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:53.440\nThen we're gonna scroll up here to our,\nwhat is our name of our page?\n\n308\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:53.940\nThere it is.\n\n309\n00:16:58.245 --> 00:17:01.937\nOkay, so what we're doing here is we're\nsaying, hey, the settings fields repair\n\n310\n00:17:01.937 --> 00:17:05.330\nall of the data for our settings group\nthat we define with register settings.\n\n311\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:06.830\nIf you recall we did that up in\n\n312\n00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.760\nour function that we hooked into,\nadmin, in it.\n\n313\n00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.760\nWe had our register setting and\nwe had our group attached to our option.\n\n314\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.840\nSo we're saying hey, we're preparing\nour settings page for the group for\n\n315\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.380\nthose settings.\n\n316\n00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.950\nSo then here we're doing\nour settings_fields,\n\n317\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.310\nthat's getting that ready.\n\n318\n00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.963\nOur do_settings_section outputs all of\nour fields in our form into different\n\n319\n00:17:24.963 --> 00:17:25.519\nsections.\n\n320\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.640\nSo in this case, you have to pass the page\nslug that all the sections are on.\n\n321\n00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.370\nSo once again,\n\n322\n00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.460\nwe're defining the page slug, we've\npassed this multiple times throughout.\n\n323\n00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.515\nJust one of those redundancies\nthat you're gonna play with.\n\n324\n00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:40.080\nAnd the last one at least, we need to\nuse this function called submit_button,\n\n325\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.970\nand that's where WordPress outputs\nall the extra things it needs\n\n326\n00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.060\nto allow the user to save the form.\n\n327\n00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:52.990\nOkay, so\nI believe if I did all this right.\n\n328\n00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.539\nI don't see any of our tutors left,\nso let's take a look.\n\n329\n00:17:57.539 --> 00:17:59.800\nWhat this looks like.\n\n330\n00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.180\nAll right, so\nwe have our main settings section.\n\n331\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.180\nSo let's go through function\nby function here so\n\n332\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.250\nwe can see where all this is coming from.\n\n333\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.570\nWe have our main settings.\n\n334\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:13.130\nOur title was here and\nit has a function, fc_generate_section.\n\n335\n00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.930\nWe're gonna scroll down here to\nour fc_generate_function callback.\n\n336\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.240\nAnd in there was some stuff.\n\n337\n00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.620\nSo here's our Main Settings header tag,\nand there's that some stuff we put in.\n\n338\n00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.400\nThis could be some information\nabout the settings section.\n\n339\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.990\nSo if we had two different sections here,\nemail settings and color settings.\n\n340\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.021\nYou could have some text there saying,\nhey, these settings will affect this or\n\n341\n00:18:33.021 --> 00:18:34.423\nthese settings will affect this, or\n\n342\n00:18:34.423 --> 00:18:36.640\nmaybe if there's an error\nyou could display it there.\n\n343\n00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.600\nThings along those lines.\n\n344\n00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.540\nAnd then we have our settings_field, which\nwe attach here, the add_settings field.\n\n345\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.590\nWe attach to that section on this page and\n\n346\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:53.040\nwe pass set a function and\nthat function down here as an input type.\n\n347\n00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.560\nSo if we look here we have our,\nWhat Is Our Favorite Color?\n\n348\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.500\nThat was the title that\nwe passed at the top.\n\n349\n00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.040\nAnd that parameter,\n\n350\n00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.570\nand then our box here corresponds\nto this generated function here.\n\n351\n00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.010\nAnd since there's not currently\nan option stored yet,\n\n352\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.710\nsince we're doing a new option of\nfc_settings, it did not find any values so\n\n353\n00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:14.260\nwe got this default of\nblue which we see here.\n\n354\n00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:20.620\nSo now if we change this,\nwe hit Save Changes,\n\n355\n00:19:23.241 --> 00:19:26.763\nNow if we refresh the page just\nto make sure it's still green,\n\n356\n00:19:26.763 --> 00:19:31.166\nit is still green because it is now saved\ncuz WordPress took care of all that for\n\n357\n00:19:31.166 --> 00:19:35.004\nus using the options.php that we\nsent to and the submit_button.\n\n358\n00:19:35.004 --> 00:19:37.746\nWordPress knows to handle\nall of your saving data.\n\n359\n00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:39.760\nDoes that sort of make sense, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n360\n00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.340\nI mean it makes sense what's happening.\n\n361\n00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.510\nI've seen some paradigms similar to this.\n\n362\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.300\nIt would probably take me the first couple\nof times, I would have to sit down and\n\n363\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.100\nflowchart this.\n\n364\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.770\nAll right, so I need to do this first,\nthen I need to set this up,\n\n365\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.060\nthen this actually causes\nthis to print out.\n\n366\n00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.570\nI'll tell you something right\nnow that I would mess up on,\n\n367\n00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.700\nis the echo of the input.\n\n368\n00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.000\nI would try to return it initially,\n\n369\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.590\njust if I was going through\nthis the first time.\n\n370\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.400\nBut these are thing, I'm pretty sure\nonce you get used to this API and\n\n371\n00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.460\nthis setup, it just becomes\nlittle bit of a second nature.\n\n372\n00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:19.030\nMaybe not always just in the forefront\nof your mind, but the first time can\n\n373\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.280\nbe a little difficult, otherwise I can see\nwhat is going on, I can kind of trace it,\n\n374\n00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.870\nso it is not crazy so to speak.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and it would be helpful if we\n\n375\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.887\nadded another field, just so we can see-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, examples, examples,\n\n376\n00:20:30.887 --> 00:20:33.270\nexamples are always fun.\n\n377\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.820\nJust so you can kinda trace,\nlike execution path and\n\n378\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.780\nlogic throughout with these things.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n379\n00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.060\nonce we have maybe our plugins page or\nthemes page show up,\n\n380\n00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.015\nyou already have your settings and\nyou go hey, I need to add a new settings.\n\n381\n00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:48.340\nWell now all you have to do is add one\nextra function in there, and you're done.\n\n382\n00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.440\nYou don't have to do much else.\n\n383\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.340\nSo we're gonna copy and\npaste our color field.\n\n384\n00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.510\nAnd we're gonna ask for\nfavorite_number now.\n\n385\n00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.480\nAnd so inside we're gonna create\nnew a variable called number.\n\n386\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:09.410\nAnd all we're just doing, oop, I can,\nWe will change the names to number.\n\n387\n00:21:11.515 --> 00:21:13.530\nWe'll change all the indexes to number.\n\n388\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.072\nNumber, number.\n\n389\n00:21:20.766 --> 00:21:24.289\nAnd we'll go and the change text,\nthe type of the input to number just so\n\n390\n00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:26.540\nwe can see how that\ndifference would appear.\n\n391\n00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.790\nThen all you have to do is\nregister this new field.\n\n392\n00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.560\nSo we come back up here to\nour add_settings field,\n\n393\n00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.830\nwe're going to copy and paste this.\n\n394\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.940\nAnd we need a new id, so we're just\ngoing to replace color with number,\n\n395\n00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.510\nand change the title to what\nis your favorite number?\n\n396\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.992\nAnd then we are going to attach this\nfact_function to the call back,\n\n397\n00:21:49.992 --> 00:21:52.840\nand that should be all we have to do.\n\n398\n00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.531\nSo let's hop back over here and\nreload the page.\n\n399\n00:21:58.993 --> 00:22:01.280\nAnd so now we have our what\nis our favorite number.\n\n400\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.090\nWe didn't change the default which is\nwhy it's not showing anything there.\n\n401\n00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.750\nSo we're gonna switch the default to zero.\n\n402\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.370\nOop.\n\n403\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.360\nActually, let's put it to 13.\n\n404\n00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.191\n13's a nice round number.\n\n405\n00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:13.330\nAnd I'm gonna refresh that.\n\n406\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.240\nSo there is our two different fields,\nand all we had to do was add one\n\n407\n00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.860\nextra function and\nnot have to change anything else.\n\n408\n00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.050\nSo once you get passed the first step,\nadding new settings and\n\n409\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.360\nnew sections are very easy.\n\n410\n00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.797\nSo in our case, and\njust to show that these are two\n\n411\n00:22:27.797 --> 00:22:31.597\ndifferent fields by changing that echo.\n\n412\n00:22:31.597 --> 00:22:34.708\nOoh, that is really tiny.\n\n413\n00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:37.170\nCan you make that?\n&gt;&gt; Control plus.\n\n414\n00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.060\n&gt;&gt; Nope, that only changes the page.\n\n415\n00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.613\nOkay, so you can just trust me [LAUGH]\nthat these are two separate fields and\n\n416\n00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:47.286\nit knows that because of in our\nfunctions one is a text type,\n\n417\n00:22:47.286 --> 00:22:51.418\nor one is an input type of number,\nand one was an input type of text.\n\n418\n00:22:51.418 --> 00:22:54.540\nAnd we define that within\nthe generation functions.\n\n419\n00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.510\nAnd now if we were to try to change this\nto a word, like that, and try to save,\n\n420\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.861\nour browser would be like, hey no,\nyou need to put a number there,\n\n421\n00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:07.313\nbecause we have an input\ntype of number and not text.\n\n422\n00:23:07.313 --> 00:23:08.810\nDoes that sorta make sense, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n423\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:09.560\n&gt;&gt; How we were going through and\n\n424\n00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.590\nadding fields.\n&gt;&gt; I can see the utility of this.\n\n425\n00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:16.250\nI can see how this ends up being\none of those tools we reach for\n\n426\n00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.400\nwhen we're trying to\nbuild pages like this.\n\n427\n00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.770\nNow Frank, as far as this\nsettings kind of sections and\n\n428\n00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.380\nfeels, are there any other\nthings we need to be aware of?\n\n429\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.150\nAny gotchas that might come up?\n\n430\n00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.760\nObviously we've already discussed,\nthere's things you gotta be careful of.\n\n431\n00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.640\nOutside of those,\nare there any other concerns or\n\n432\n00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.410\nthings that we need to know?\n&gt;&gt; Well when it comes to developers,\n\n433\n00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.130\nwe like to do everything ourselves.\n\n434\n00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.630\nSo you might have the tendency to go,\nhey, I don't need to learn this.\n\n435\n00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.400\nI can just build all this myself using the\nposts like we did before, using options,\n\n436\n00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.010\nmaybe even saving into a data\nbase we wanna do ourselves.\n\n437\n00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.570\nWell the issue is when a user goes to one\nsettings page and they see it done one way\n\n438\n00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.260\nand they go to another settings page and\nit's all different and\n\n439\n00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.778\nthen another settings page and it's also\nall different, it gets really confusing.\n\n440\n00:23:57.778 --> 00:24:00.560\nSo we wanna try to make sure\nthe UIs all match to make the best\n\n441\n00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.820\nexperience for the user.\n\n442\n00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.950\nSo it's a good idea, even thought there's\nsome confusing parts in here and you might\n\n443\n00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.080\nhave to check documentation a few times to\nreally understand what's going on here.\n\n444\n00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.040\nIt's a good idea to learn it and\nto use these systems.\n\n445\n00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.550\nThere may be times when you\nhave to go outside of that, but\n\n446\n00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.790\nyou should try to make it a normal\npractice of using these systems for\n\n447\n00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.710\nconsistency for the end user.\n&gt;&gt; I totally agree, consistency,\n\n448\n00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.650\nconsistency, consistency,\nit's gonna make your life easier,\n\n449\n00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.230\nmy life easier, your life easier as well.\n\n450\n00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.490\nSo definitely take that to the bank,\nright.\n\n451\n00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.223\nWrap it up, keep it close to your heart.\n\n452\n00:24:32.223 --> 00:24:35.708\nWell, we do have more things that we\nhave to worry about in WordPress, but\n\n453\n00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:37.410\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n454\n00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.630\nSo we're going to have to\ncome on back with more.\n\n455\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.920\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n456\n00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.340\nSo signing out for DevProTV,\nI've been your host,\n\n457\n00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.990\nJustin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Frank Coursen.\n\n458\n00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.807\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:24:49.807 -->

Justin Dennison, and\n\n3\n00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.650\nwe're continuing on our trek through\nWordPress development, and in particular,\n\n4\n00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830\nwe're going to be looking\nat security essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.160\nWe've alluded to it in\nthe previous episodes.\n\n6\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.990\nBut we're actually going\nto deliver this time.\n\n7\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.240\nWell, I'm not going to deliver.\n\n8\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.401\nBut we do have a delivery man\nin house today, Mr. Frank Corso.\n\n9\n00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.852\nHow are you doing today Frank?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n10\n00:00:35.852 --> 00:00:37.970\nHow are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.290\nNow security essentials.\n\n12\n00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.930\nSo what I'm thinking is,\nthese are the bare\n\n13\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.460\nminimum you need to consider when\nyou're doing WordPress Development,\n\n14\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.960\njust to try to keep things safe,\nkeep things from being an issue so\n\n15\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.590\nwhat do we need to know?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n16\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.720\nwhen it comes to WordPress let's\ntake a step back real quick and\n\n17\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.270\ntalk about security and\nhacks and fun things like that.\n\n18\n00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.082\nSo when it comes to WordPress the three\nmost common types of hacks is brute-force\n\n19\n00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:08.460\nattack, SQL injection attack,\nand cross-site scripting.\n\n20\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.180\nNow in this particular episode we're not\ngoing to talk about brute-force attack\n\n21\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.100\nquite as much but\nwe are going to talk about the other two.\n\n22\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.930\nAnd we need to find ways to\nprevent that from happening.\n\n23\n00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.010\nSo an SQL intentional hack\nis basically where a user\n\n24\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.530\nputs in malicious SQL things that\nyou send to the database and\n\n25\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.920\nthey accidentally get all your credit card\nnumbers, or all the user passwords or\n\n26\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.930\nthey change the website in\nsome way that would be bad.\n\n27\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.100\nCross-site scripting is where they\ntrick an authorized user to do it,\n\n28\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.090\nin most cases, there's other examples.\n\n29\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.540\nSo, for example,\nmaybe there's a link on your website\n\n30\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.190\nthat you then can click delete and\nit will delete a user.\n\n31\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.390\nWell if someone goes here's a link and\nclick on it to win thousands of dollars\n\n32\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.440\nand someone clicks on that link and it's\nactually linked to delete a certain user.\n\n33\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.894\nAnd it loads a page, the user's deleted\nand they accidentally did it and\n\n34\n00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:56.246\ndidn't mean to, that would be\nan example of cross-site scripting.\n\n35\n00:01:56.246 --> 00:01:58.804\nNow cross-site scripting, XSS for short,\n\n36\n00:01:58.804 --> 00:02:03.122\nand then the other example would be\ncross-site request forgeries, CSRF.\n\n37\n00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.180\nAnd those kind of play together.\n\n38\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.150\nAnd that's what we're trying to prevent\nwith a lot of the security essentials\n\n39\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.090\nwe're going to go over in this lesson.\n\n40\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.530\nSo let's jump to the laptop screen and\n\n41\n00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.990\nwe're gonna go over\na couple of examples here.\n\n42\n00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.720\nSo let me switch over\nto our settings page.\n\n43\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.324\nAnd so two episodes ago,\nwe had a settings page like this.\n\n44\n00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:23.183\nNow in the last episode we did some\nchanges to make it into the WordPress\n\n45\n00:02:23.183 --> 00:02:25.751\nsetting system, but\nwe're gonna go back to the basics today so\n\n46\n00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:28.395\nyou can see these examples\nin an easier way.\n\n47\n00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:30.270\nSo what I did was reverted\nback to our original, so\n\n48\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.510\nlet's hop over to our original,\nit looked fairly similar to this.\n\n49\n00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.180\nAnd right now if I try\nto access this page, so\n\n50\n00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.380\nyou may recall back in our\nmenu which is way up here,\n\n51\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.240\nwe said you had to have manage_options\nto see this in the menu.\n\n52\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.210\nBut right now if someone\nhad the link to it.\n\n53\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.200\nWell, they could just type in the link or\nsend someone to that link and\n\n54\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.410\nwe're not checking to make sure\nthey actually have that option.\n\n55\n00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.260\nThat option,\n\n56\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.070\nthat capability is just preventing\nthem from seeing the page in the menu.\n\n57\n00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.838\nSo we're gonna scroll down and\nwe're gonna add one quick check here.\n\n58\n00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:16.160\nThat says if the current user can manage\noptions, if they can not do that, return.\n\n59\n00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.120\nSo basically what this is doing,\nthis current user can\n\n60\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.770\nis checking if the current user has\na capability we're passing to it.\n\n61\n00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.470\nSo we're saying manage options\nwhich is the same capability we\n\n62\n00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.780\nadded when we added it to the menu.\n\n63\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.020\nAnd by using this little symbol here,\nthe exclamation point, we're asking for\n\n64\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.230\nthe opposite of that.\n\n65\n00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.900\nSo just in case you're not\nfamiliar with PHP, essentially,\n\n66\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.730\nbefore the current user can manage options\nthat's been returned true or false.\n\n67\n00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.620\nAnd we want the opposite of that,\ncuz we want to check to make sure, hey,\n\n68\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.020\nif this person does not have\nthe capability, they should not be here.\n\n69\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.533\nSo that's our first line.\n\n70\n00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:50.820\nAnd then, from there, we can go on\nto do some of our other checks.\n\n71\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.780\nBut this would prevent anyone from,\nwho does not have authorization,\n\n72\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.160\nfrom key-typing in the URL and\ngetting to this page.\n\n73\n00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.820\nSo the next thing we wanna do\nis something called Escaping.\n\n74\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.760\nNow WordPress has this really handy page,\nthat you'll probably wanna take some time\n\n75\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.990\nplaying around with, called Validating,\nSanitizing, and Escaping User Data.\n\n76\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.617\nOne of the biggest things you need to\nremember always is you can never trust\n\n77\n00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:15.297\nthe user.\n\n78\n00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:15.995\nMaybe you can trust me.\n\n79\n00:04:15.995 --> 00:04:17.250\nMaybe you can trust Justin.\n\n80\n00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.680\nBut you don't always know if we're\nactually the ones sitting here.\n\n81\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.630\nSo maybe Justin and myself logged in.\n\n82\n00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.700\nMaybe it looks like we logged in, but\n\n83\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.740\nmaybe we're not the people\nwe're supposed to be.\n\n84\n00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.620\nOr maybe we're typing in something that\nprobably isn't quite that you wanna\n\n85\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.259\nbe expecting.\n\n86\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.310\nSo this is why we validate, sanitize,\nand escape even from the admin pages.\n\n87\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.000\nSo an example of validating\nis checking user inputs.\n\n88\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.380\nSo this is where you'd want to make sure,\nfor example, maybe,\n\n89\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.660\nwe want to have only set colors.\n\n90\n00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.800\nAnd so, instead of a text box,\nmaybe we have a select drop-down, blue,\n\n91\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.330\ngreen, or black.\n\n92\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.838\nThose are your favorite colors.\n\n93\n00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:52.820\nSo when it got to our side,\n\n94\n00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.780\nthey were going to save it, we would check\nthese can only be blue, green or black.\n\n95\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.900\nAnd if it's not,\nthen default to something else.\n\n96\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.310\nThat's an example of validating.\n\n97\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.420\nOr if we're accepting a number, you\ncould use a PHB function called Intabow,\n\n98\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.580\nwhich you may have come across before.\n\n99\n00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.520\nI'm just gonna type in a random one,\njust so you can see that in usage.\n\n100\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.240\nSo this was ID, something like that.\n\n101\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.550\nWe said ID equals some random\nstring that I typed in.\n\n102\n00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.560\nIntval is a PHP function that would\nconvert whatever you pass into this into\n\n103\n00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.185\nan integer.\n\n104\n00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:24.480\nSo this would be a way that\nyou could validate, hey,\n\n105\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.920\nthis needs to be an integer.\n\n106\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.260\nIf he or she typed in anything else,\nwe don't want that.\n\n107\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.220\nThat's not right.\nSo that would be an example of validation.\n\n108\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.250\nNow in our case,\nwe don't really have anything to validate.\n\n109\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.930\nWe're just asking for favorite color,\nso we're going to leave that for now.\n\n110\n00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.550\nWhat we will do, is if we scroll\ndown to the sanitization section,\n\n111\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.770\nthis is where we can clean up user input.\n\n112\n00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.120\nSo, for example,\nthere's several functions in here,\n\n113\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.500\nsuch as \"sanitize text field.\" and\nthis is where WordPress\n\n114\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.330\nhas all these functions that\nwill do most of this for you.\n\n115\n00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.490\nThey'll go through,\nthey'll scan all the contents and\n\n116\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.120\nwhatever variable you're\npassing through it.\n\n117\n00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.660\nMake sure it's non-SQL injection,\nmake sure there's no scripts or\n\n118\n00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.160\nweird things in it,\ncertain characters that are not allowed.\n\n119\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.620\nThey'll strip that out and\n\n120\n00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.700\nmake sure it's safe, relatively,\nto be stored into the database.\n\n121\n00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.350\nSo, WordPress,\nthere should be, here we go.\n\n122\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.380\nThey have these functions built in so\n\n123\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.870\nyou don't have to do most of this for\nyourself.\n\n124\n00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.790\nSo you can sanitize email.\n\n125\n00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.620\nYou can sanitize file names,\ntext boxes, text fields.\n\n126\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.680\nEven similarly the SQL, like the order\nbys, the user, all those different things.\n\n127\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.320\nYou can use one of these\nbuilt in WordPress functions\n\n128\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.620\nto sanitize some of the user input.\n\n129\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.920\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go to sanitize.\n\n130\n00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.800\nOops no, just sanitize text field.\n\n131\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.180\nBecause we want to sanitize\nour favorite color.\n\n132\n00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.780\nMake sure they're typing in something\nthat we want them to type in.\n\n133\n00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.890\nAnd if we look here,\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n134\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.200\nIt's the function.\n\n135\n00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.120\nOnly one parameter is the string.\n\n136\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.360\nAnd then if we come back,\nwe look at when it gets returned.\n\n137\n00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.850\nIt's just going to return us\nthe string back that's sanitized.\n\n138\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:01.340\nSo we're gonna go down here and\nwe're gonna type in sanitize_text_field\n\n139\n00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.710\nlike this and wrap around our post there.\n\n140\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.140\nAnd now when we get into this section\n\n141\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.810\nwe're sanitizing those contents before\nwe're sorting into the database.\n\n142\n00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.283\nNow on the opposite end of sanitization,\nonce we've validated the input,\n\n143\n00:07:18.283 --> 00:07:21.167\nmaybe we want to output\nthat data somewhere.\n\n144\n00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:24.795\nSo in our case, we might be outputting the\nfavorite color somewhere on the website,\n\n145\n00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:28.420\nmaybe on the footer, or maybe in your\nauthor bio, wherever the case may be.\n\n146\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.730\nWell, in that case, we want to escape it.\n\n147\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.980\nThis is because maybe we didn't sanitize\nit right, or maybe it's pulling\n\n148\n00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.900\nin from somewhere else or remote sourced\nand inside there might be malicious code.\n\n149\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.112\nSo it could be some JavaScript that\nredirects to certain sites you don't\n\n150\n00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:42.640\nwant them to redirect to.\n\n151\n00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.570\nMaybe it's gonna have some nasty pop up.\n\n152\n00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.680\nEveryone's seen those.\n\n153\n00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.771\nYour computer's been infected, pay us $99.\n\n154\n00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:51.026\nBut everyone's seen something like that.\n\n155\n00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:54.092\nSo then in that case,\nthat could be output and\n\n156\n00:07:54.092 --> 00:07:58.541\nso we want to escape it to remove\nthose kind of malicious content.\n\n157\n00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:02.549\nSo, once again WordPress has\nall these built in functions.\n\n158\n00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:06.497\nSuch as escape HTML,\nescape URL, escape JavaScript,\n\n159\n00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:10.530\nescape attributes,\nescape text areas, and even more.\n\n160\n00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.740\nAnd so you can use these depending\non what we're outputting.\n\n161\n00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.800\nSo in our case,\nwe are outputting into a value\n\n162\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.340\nattribute of an input, so\nwe're gonna use the escape attribute.\n\n163\n00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.470\nSo we're gonna come down here,\necho esc_attr.\n\n164\n00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.330\nWe're gonna wrap it like that.\n\n165\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.490\nLet me scroll up just so you can see that.\n\n166\n00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.990\nAnd so instead of just echoing out\nour color, like we did before,\n\n167\n00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.980\nwe're gonna escape\nthe attribute to take out any\n\n168\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.870\nmalicious content that\nmight be inappropriate.\n\n169\n00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:47.150\nAnd then we could also have done this\naround any HTML if we had HTML or a URL.\n\n170\n00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.790\nThere's a few other ones that you could\ndo when you're escaping URLs, but for\n\n171\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.560\nright now, escape URL is\na really good starting place.\n\n172\n00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.280\nWe could also do things like\nthe JavaScript or the text area.\n\n173\n00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.850\nIn our case, it doesn't really\napply to our settings page,\n\n174\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.270\nbut you'd want to look into those\ndepending on what you're escaping.\n\n175\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.930\n&gt;&gt; So sanitization is something that we do\n\n176\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.590\non data that's coming in.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n177\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.629\n&gt;&gt; And then escaping is something that we\n\n178\n00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.737\nmay want to do as the data is coming out.\n\n179\n00:09:07.737 --> 00:09:10.920\nAnd that may be because we're\nnot the one who has control over\n\n180\n00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.460\nsaid data that is being manipulated,\nright, that we're outputting to a page.\n\n181\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.020\nSo would you say it's best\npractice to both sanitize and\n\n182\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.710\nescape to the fullest extent possible,\njust to kind of\n\n183\n00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.380\nto make sure if you whoopsie-dasied on the\nway in, you're escaping on the way out,\n\n184\n00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.290\nlike a double door, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n185\n00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.160\nlike I said at the beginning,\nnever trust the user.\n\n186\n00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.930\nSo in this case, we might have\ntyped something in that got past\n\n187\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.960\nthe sanitization, or\nmaybe it's coming from an external source.\n\n188\n00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.740\nOr maybe for whatever reason, they build\nanother script outside of your plugin that\n\n189\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.640\nallows them to input data\ninto their favorite color.\n\n190\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.020\nThat's outside of our\nsanitization technique.\n\n191\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.750\nSo we still want to escape it,\n\n192\n00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.630\njust in case there was another way\nthat they entered that data in.\n\n193\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.190\nAnd that way,\nwe know that that data is secure.\n\n194\n00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.550\n&gt;&gt; Followup question to that.\n\n195\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.250\nI noticed that the escape has escape js,\nescape html.\n\n196\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.890\nWhat happens if there's, for\nthese escape properties,\n\n197\n00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.530\nwhat if I'm expecting JavaScript, and\nthen there's HTML that comes in that?\n\n198\n00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.140\nObviously, I'm just asking,\ndoes the function break?\n\n199\n00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.050\nDo things break, or\ndoes it still behave appropriately?\n\n200\n00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.630\nOr is there a general function where I\ncan say, I need to escape something, but\n\n201\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.700\nI'm not real sure,\nI want to hedge my bets?\n\n202\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.030\nIs there a function like that?\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily.\n\n203\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.700\nSo when it comes to these\ndifferent functions,\n\n204\n00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.250\neach one handles things\na little bit differently.\n\n205\n00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.103\nSo the escape html tries to strip out\nthings that would be inappropriate\n\n206\n00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:38.100\nwithin HTML.\n\n207\n00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.462\nWhereas the escape JavaScript,\nif we look at that example right there,\n\n208\n00:10:41.462 --> 00:10:45.046\nthis is being right into that would be\nexecutable JavaScript because it's in\n\n209\n00:10:45.046 --> 00:10:46.497\nthe on click attribute there.\n\n210\n00:10:46.497 --> 00:10:49.940\nWhereas the escape attribute,\nit would be contents within an attribute.\n\n211\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.924\nSo they have different focuses,\nso theoretically,\n\n212\n00:10:52.924 --> 00:10:54.990\nthey're not going to break things.\n\n213\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.760\nBut in reality, they will depending on\nthe scope of what you're outputting.\n\n214\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.580\nSo if you're outputting something that's\nreally mixed with HTML, CMS, JavaScript,\n\n215\n00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.200\nyou're outputting various things.\n\n216\n00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.028\nYou might need to play around and look\nthrough some of these actual documentation\n\n217\n00:11:07.028 --> 00:11:09.828\na little further to find something that\nmight be a little bit more appropriate.\n\n218\n00:11:09.828 --> 00:11:13.685\nOr you might have to build something that\nhandles some more of the escaping on your\n\n219\n00:11:13.685 --> 00:11:16.258\nown.\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a follow up question, and\n\n220\n00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:21.228\nI'm sure this is handled, but it was\nkind of like, what if I get an HTML,\n\n221\n00:11:21.228 --> 00:11:26.150\nbut it has an embedded script\ntag that's not inline like that?\n\n222\n00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.952\nBut it's like a script tag with JavaScript\nwithin it, does the esc_html, does it\n\n223\n00:11:30.952 --> 00:11:34.489\nalso ensure that those are non-executable?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n224\n00:11:34.489 --> 00:11:36.320\nI have an example up on the screen here.\n\n225\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.580\nAnd what the esc_html will do, so yes,\n\n226\n00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.310\nit will remove any of those tags into\njust general content like we show here.\n\n227\n00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.940\nWe have an anchor tag that would\nnormally be shown as a link, or\n\n228\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.780\nin this case, now it's being shown,\nit breaks it down.\n\n229\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.440\nSo it would catch most script tags, but\nsomething to be aware of is there's tricks\n\n230\n00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.100\nthat hackers can use to get\naround these sort of things.\n\n231\n00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.725\nSo you want to be aware of those and\nwatch what you're escaping if you're\n\n232\n00:12:03.725 --> 00:12:05.990\nanticipating a lot of different\nscript things going on.\n\n233\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.030\nThis is open to pretty much anyone.\n\n234\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.340\nYou might have a few extra\nlayers you would build in here.\n\n235\n00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.250\nBut for an essentials part, this would\nbe a great beginning first step.\n\n236\n00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Full disclosure, Frank,\n\n237\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.550\nthe only reason I ask these questions is\nbecause I've played around with, well,\n\n238\n00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.600\nwhat if I wrap this in HTML and\nthen put it here and\n\n239\n00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.000\nthen make this a callback on an error and\nthen force an error?\n\n240\n00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.030\nSo there's a bunch of tricks, but\n\n241\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.560\nthe impetus of my question is you\nshould be thinking about the use case.\n\n242\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.130\nYou should really put some thought\nwhen you're taking user input and\n\n243\n00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.450\nwhen you're outputting to\nthe screen from a data source that\n\n244\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.060\nyou do not directly control, right?\n\n245\n00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.654\nSo just be aware, sanitization in,\n\n246\n00:12:45.654 --> 00:12:49.750\nescaping out and\nreally try to put some thought and\n\n247\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.400\nconsideration when you're using these.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, and\n\n248\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.520\nif you have, you're expecting\na lot of different HTML and\n\n249\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.460\na lot of different tags, there are other\nfunctions like this example here.\n\n250\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.268\nWe're not gonna go over\nsome of these right now.\n\n251\n00:13:01.268 --> 00:13:04.960\nBut WP, KSES, and several others,\n\n252\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.450\nif you look into\nthe documentation of this family,\n\n253\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.430\nthere's several other ones that will look\nfor certain HTML and tags and things.\n\n254\n00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.960\nAnd you can specify what is allowed and\nwhat is not.\n\n255\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.680\nSo if you expect HTML to come in, but\n\n256\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.755\nyou don't want any script tags,\nyou could use things like this function,\n\n257\n00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:20.680\nwhere it would look for those tags\nthat you think should not be in there.\n\n258\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.340\nAnd it will remove those for you.\n\n259\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.460\nSo something to think about,\n\n260\n00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.610\nthere's a lot of escapement sanitization\nthroughout these documentation.\n\n261\n00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.730\nSo I highly recommend you\nlooking through this.\n\n262\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.200\nBut the ones we are looking\nat right now are the very\n\n263\n00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.790\nbeginner basic ones that we want look at.\n\n264\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.830\nSo let's take another step back and\nthink of another item that,\n\n265\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.460\nat the very beginning I talked about\ncross site request forgeries and\n\n266\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.040\ncross site scripting.\n\n267\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.759\nSo right now, we have our field and\n\n268\n00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:49.331\nwe're checking to make sure the person\nhas the necessary capability.\n\n269\n00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:53.706\nSo if I were to login as Joe Schmo,\nand I try to access this page,\n\n270\n00:13:53.706 --> 00:13:55.369\nnothing would happen.\n\n271\n00:13:55.369 --> 00:13:58.330\nBut maybe I login as me,\nand I do have access.\n\n272\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.780\nI'm at this page I could type in whatever\nI wanted, and we're sanitizing it.\n\n273\n00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.320\nWe're escaping on the other end, but\nmaybe this did something important.\n\n274\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.340\nMaybe this page, there's a link on\nhere that deletes the administrator.\n\n275\n00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:15.790\nOr there's a form on here that could\ncreate a new administrative user\n\n276\n00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.860\nthat if someone filled in that data,\nit could create\n\n277\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.810\nsome new user with capabilities\nthat they could then log in to.\n\n278\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.900\nSo we wanted to find a way to prevent\npeople from just giving us a random link\n\n279\n00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.730\nand us accidentally doing something\nthat we didn't quite intend.\n\n280\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.460\nAnd that's where nonces come in.\n\n281\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.990\nSo nonces is a WordPress word that's\nused in some other frameworks, but\n\n282\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.310\nnonce is a number used once.\n\n283\n00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.114\nAnd what we can do is we can generate\nthis number when the form gets created.\n\n284\n00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:46.254\nAnd then when the form gets posted, we can\ncheck to make sure that number exists and\n\n285\n00:14:46.254 --> 00:14:47.160\nthat they match.\n\n286\n00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.347\nAnd this would prevent,\nif I was a malicious user and\n\n287\n00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:55.815\nI sent this link to Justin, he clicked on\nthat link, and it generated an admin user.\n\n288\n00:14:55.815 --> 00:14:59.345\nThen I could go in and log in as that\nadmin user and do some bad things.\n\n289\n00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:02.475\nWhereas now, I send that link to him and\nhe goes to that page and it goes,\n\n290\n00:15:02.475 --> 00:15:04.125\nhey whoa, you don't have a nonce.\n\n291\n00:15:04.125 --> 00:15:06.625\nI don't know what you're trying to do\nhere cuz you don't have a nonce, so\n\n292\n00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:08.475\nthis must not have been\nan intended action.\n\n293\n00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:12.640\nSo there's a lot of different\nways we could do this.\n\n294\n00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.460\nBut we're gonna look at one,\nso if hypothetically,\n\n295\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.920\nwe're not gonna go through some of these.\n\n296\n00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.930\nBut you could add a nonce to the URL.\n\n297\n00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:26.900\nSo if you have some Ajax calls going on,\nyou could use WP nonce URL.\n\n298\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.547\nBut what we're gonna do is we're\ngoing to use WP nonce field,\n\n299\n00:15:30.547 --> 00:15:34.981\nand what this does is it adds a few\ndifferent hidden elements into our form.\n\n300\n00:15:34.981 --> 00:15:39.966\nAnd this is where our number begins,\nso for us, we're gonna hop over here.\n\n301\n00:15:39.966 --> 00:15:44.810\nAnd I'm gonna copy and paste one from\none of my plugins, just so I, Get this.\n\n302\n00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.214\nWe're gonna hop into our field,\ninto our form.\n\n303\n00:15:48.214 --> 00:15:53.032\nAnd we're gonna drop in, let me scroll up\na little bit so you can see that here,\n\n304\n00:15:53.032 --> 00:15:55.964\nand we're gonna rename\nthese to form_nonce.\n\n305\n00:15:57.618 --> 00:16:01.544\nOur_form, so what this will do\nis output a few hidden types.\n\n306\n00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:04.263\nAnd it generates this number used once for\nus, and\n\n307\n00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:06.680\nstores those into those event types.\n\n308\n00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.050\nSo we have our form nonce and our form.\n\n309\n00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.677\nSo let's go ahead and bring up,\n\n310\n00:16:10.677 --> 00:16:13.646\nlet's see if we can get to\nthat documentation easy, yep.\n\n311\n00:16:15.727 --> 00:16:19.821\nAnd while that's loading,\nI'm gonna scroll to verify [INAUDIBLE]\n\n312\n00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:25.260\nAnd I'm gonna look for\nthe one we're using, there we go.\n\n313\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.657\nLet's hop over to\nthe documentation here just so\n\n314\n00:16:27.657 --> 00:16:29.474\nyou can see those parameters in use.\n\n315\n00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:33.640\nSo there's a few different\nthings you could do here.\n\n316\n00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.670\nBut for us, we're just gonna\nstick to the two required ones,\n\n317\n00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.790\njust to make things easy.\n\n318\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.680\nBut we have your nonce and\nname which is the name of your nonce, so\n\n319\n00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.190\nthe nonce get stored,\nthe number gets stored into a nonce name.\n\n320\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.170\nSo sort of like the variable,\nor the option name.\n\n321\n00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.480\nIt's just a nonce name.\n\n322\n00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.110\nAnd the action is the action\nthat's taking place.\n\n323\n00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.950\nSo when I check, when we go to verify,\nwhich we'll do in just a moment,\n\n324\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.670\nwe're gonna use both of these again.\n\n325\n00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.640\nSo we wanna make sure these why not?\n\n326\n00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.950\nAnd then, if you wanted to,\n\n327\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.840\nonce you get beyond things you\ncould use these other options.\n\n328\n00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.480\nYou set up where this action is being\nreferred from, you could have this echo,\n\n329\n00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.010\nthere's a few different options there\nthat's a little bit beyond the scope of\n\n330\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.450\nwhat we're going over today but just be\naware those other options are also there.\n\n331\n00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.210\nSo then, we have our nonce field.\n\n332\n00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:18.420\nAnd what we're going to do is scroll up\nhere, and instead of checking the color is\n\n333\n00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.760\nset, which isn't quite as secure\nas we probably want it to be,\n\n334\n00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.470\nwe're going to make sure our nonce is set.\n\n335\n00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:31.421\nAnd, we're going to use this verify nonce,\nwhich let me get back to that one.\n\n336\n00:17:33.895 --> 00:17:35.996\nSo we're going to, let me copy and\n\n337\n00:17:35.996 --> 00:17:39.478\npaste this from the other plugin\ncuz I already have it up.\n\n338\n00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.970\nAnd let me replace these and\nthen I'll explain that one.\n\n339\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.210\nSo a copy over was\nthe function wp_verify nots.\n\n340\n00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.910\nAnd what this does, so\nfirst we wanna make sure the post is set.\n\n341\n00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.790\nIf were to try to just verify this right\naway without the post actually existing\n\n342\n00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.950\nyou'll just get one of those\nerrors that index does exist.\n\n343\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.210\nSo just to prevent that,\nwe just make sure it's set first.\n\n344\n00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.390\nAnd then we jump in to WP verifying knots.\n\n345\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:13.640\nAnd what this does, is it's going to\nverify that this post, this nonce exists.\n\n346\n00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.260\nSo we're saying hey, the form note\nnonce which is the name of the nonce.\n\n347\n00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.990\nWe want to verify that and\naction our form and that is correct.\n\n348\n00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.760\nAnd that number exists and it matches\nthe exact intention of what we were after\n\n349\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.390\nour action being our form in this case.\n\n350\n00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.420\nSo we're just gonna hop over to that\ndocumentation just take a look at this,\n\n351\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.730\na wp verify nonce.\n\n352\n00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.190\nAnd what this does is it expects nonce and\n\n353\n00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.320\naction just like in our nonce\nfield that we generated.\n\n354\n00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.880\nAnd this will return a boolean, it will\nreturn our is it true is it false and\n\n355\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.820\nthere's a couple of other integers that\nit could return depending on generation.\n\n356\n00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.780\nIn our case, we just want to make\nsure that it evaluates the true.\n\n357\n00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.940\nAnd if it is,\nthen we wanna sanitize our field, and\n\n358\n00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.740\nthen we wanna store into the database.\n\n359\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.960\nSo by using this none system, we can\nprevent most cross site scripting attacks,\n\n360\n00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.080\nas well as, by using sanitation echoing,\nwe can prevent most SQL injection attacks.\n\n361\n00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.930\nDoes that sort of make sense\nhow it comes together?\n\n362\n00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:12.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n363\n00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.390\nI'm still stuck on the word nonce.\n\n364\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.190\nWe were talking before the show, and\nnonce, I just hear them called tokens.\n\n365\n00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.780\nI don't think of them as nonces.\n\n366\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.540\nBut it makes sense.\n\n367\n00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.750\nIt's a once used number,\nor a once used token.\n\n368\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.610\nSo, you know, you remember things,\n\n369\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.550\nthat they came up with some interesting,\nrememberable fields.\n\n370\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.590\nBut, this is something that I'm glad\n\n371\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.370\nWordPress provides you to\nkind of take care of it.\n\n372\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.670\nI mean you still have to do it, but\n\n373\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.824\ndoing this outside of the WordPress\nenvironment can get a little tricky.\n\n374\n00:19:41.824 --> 00:19:43.950\nGenerally token, put it over here,\n\n375\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.500\nit's gotta be on the in field,\nis the token even available.\n\n376\n00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.200\nI mean verify it, so I like that this\nis kind of at the forefront, but\n\n377\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.760\na fairly standard use case in this case.\n&gt;&gt; Yes and what's really nice about it\n\n378\n00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.230\nis there's a lot of other nonce functions,\nI have some on the screen there, that you\n\n379\n00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.460\ncan also use a lot of these check admin\nreferrers, check AJAX referrers and then\n\n380\n00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.920\nyou can even modify the nonce system to\nextend the lifetime of a token and things.\n\n381\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.420\nSo there's a lot of things you can do\nto manipulate this if this doesn't\n\n382\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.090\nquite reach what you're after.\n\n383\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.700\nBut also allow you to extend\nthe system and do a lot more with it.\n\n384\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.330\nSo it's very powerful,\nsomething you definitely need to use\n\n385\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.200\nto prevent some of the attacks\nthat I mentioned before.\n\n386\n00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.030\nSo it's really nice, just an added bonus,\n\n387\n00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.250\nif you're looking at plugins in their\nplugin repository that WordPress uses,\n\n388\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.020\nthey have their plugin marketplace and\nyou can go and find plugins to use.\n\n389\n00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.140\nThey have scanners throughout their\nsystem that check to see if they post or\n\n390\n00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.200\nget data that's not being sanitized.\n\n391\n00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.230\nAnd they also check for nonces.\n\n392\n00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.990\nSo if there's an insecure plugin in the\nmarketplace, they'll try to catch it and\n\n393\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.210\nthen remove it from the marketplace and\nallow the developer to fix it so\n\n394\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.730\nit doesn't get into people's websites.\n\n395\n00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.500\nNow, of course, they're system's not\nperfect, so it's not something to rely on,\n\n396\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.880\nbut knowing this, you can scan whatever\nplugin you're looking at and you can just\n\n397\n00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.220\nglance at it and make sure that there's\nnonces and sanitization happening so\n\n398\n00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.880\nyou know the plugin you're about to use on\nyour website is a little bit more secure.\n\n399\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.230\nAnd that way,\neven if you don't build it, yourself,\n\n400\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.240\nyou at least know what you're looking for\nin other plugins and themes.\n\n401\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.450\nDoes that kind of make\nsense how that would?\n\n402\n00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes perfect sense.\n\n403\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.580\nAnd I'm glad that they're doing that,\nright?\n\n404\n00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.830\nThey could just be 'it's the wild,\nwild, west out here.\n\n405\n00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.890\nJust let it happen' and\nthen things could get real bad.\n\n406\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:19.580\nNow, as far as these kind of security\nessentials we've seen, use of nonces and\n\n407\n00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.390\nsecurity tokens to verify.\n\n408\n00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.980\nCross request site, I messed,\ncross site request forgery.\n\n409\n00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.406\nEvery time I'm [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; CSRF.\n\n410\n00:21:28.406 --> 00:21:29.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n411\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.050\nI know in my head.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.510\n&gt;&gt; And then cross x scripting, and\n\n413\n00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.420\nsome objeciton attacks.\n\n414\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.810\nSo we've seen that, are there any other\ntakeaways that we need to be aware of?\n\n415\n00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.200\nFrom an essentials standpoint,\n\n416\n00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.320\nthere's always something more\nwe could do to be more secure.\n\n417\n00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.250\nBut having these two\ntools in our tool belt,\n\n418\n00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.910\nis there anything else\nthat we need to know?\n\n419\n00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:48.940\nI think the biggest takeaway,\n\n420\n00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.260\neven if you don't remember half\nthe functions that we just went over, or\n\n421\n00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.070\nall of the other stuff, the biggest\ntakeaway is never trust user input.\n\n422\n00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.070\nNo matter what, no matter if you're like\nhey this is only in the admin section, or\n\n423\n00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.730\nthis is a menu that you can\nonly be an admin to get here,\n\n424\n00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.550\nyou should still never trust it.\n\n425\n00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.140\nSo no matter what the data's coming\nfrom if you can validate it in way,\n\n426\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.650\nif you know hey, this should be a number,\nthen use invalid.\n\n427\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:08.960\nMake sure it's a number.\n\n428\n00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.120\nIf you know Know that these cannot.\n\n429\n00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.560\nThese might have SQL in it.\n\n430\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.300\nBut hey, do some sanitization,\nfind a way to validate the data, and\n\n431\n00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.750\nnot trust the user.\n\n432\n00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.090\nMost of your users are good people.\n\n433\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.290\nThey have the right intention, but\nyou don't want to leave that open for\n\n434\n00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.830\nmalicious attacks.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, there you have it.\n\n435\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.850\nWe promised that we would come back to\nit in previous episodes, and hopefully,\n\n436\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.780\nwe delivered.\n\n437\n00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.300\nAnd as I said,\nthere's always more things that we can do,\n\n438\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.100\nbut Part of this episode is we need to\nkeep this in the forefront of our mind and\n\n439\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.600\nactually employ these techniques.\n\n440\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.950\nSo thank you so much for that, Frank.\n\n441\n00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.310\nAnd well, we definitely have more to\nlearn about WordPress development,\n\n442\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.200\nso come on back.\n\n443\n00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.240\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n444\n00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.530\nSo signing off for DevProTV,\n\n445\n00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.170\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Frank Corso.\n\n446\n00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.974\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n447\n00:22:52.974 --> 00:22:57.677\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\nexciting episode of DevPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.703\nI'm you host Justin Dennison and\n\n5\n00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:23.130\nwe're continuing on trekking through\nour WordPress development series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.810\nIt's been an enjoyable journey thus far,\nbut kind of only getting started.\n\n7\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.870\nWe still got a lot more to go.\n\n8\n00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.980\nAnd in particular, we're gonna be\ntalking about widgets today, and\n\n9\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.462\nluckily we have a widget wizard in-house.\n\n10\n00:00:34.462 --> 00:00:36.630\nMr. Frank Corso,\nhow are you doing today Frank?\n\n11\n00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.100\nI'm doing well how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I almost got him on that one,\n\n12\n00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.280\nI'm doing well, and\nwhen I hear widgets for some reason,\n\n13\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.960\nI think of like old\nalgebra one math problems.\n\n14\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.330\nLike I'm building a thousand widgets\nan hour how many widgets can I build in\n\n15\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.670\na minute, but in the context of\nword press what are widgets?\n\n16\n00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's what we're gonna do today.\n\n17\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.040\nWe're gonna work on algebra and calculus,\n&gt;&gt; And physics.\n\n18\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.640\nAnd that's what we came here for.\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n\n19\n00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.148\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n20\n00:00:58.148 --> 00:00:58.656\n&gt;&gt; Well lucky-\n\n21\n00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:01.390\n&gt;&gt; That's for you I am actually a,\n\n22\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.280\nI have degrees in math and physics.\n\n23\n00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.460\nSo let's get it done.\n\n24\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.390\nLet's, let's do it.\n&gt;&gt; Well, in reality, though, when it\n\n25\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.290\ncomes to WordPress widgets, these are if\nyou've ever come across components before.\n\n26\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.020\nWe've played a little bit\nwith shortcuts before.\n\n27\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.050\nThese are gonna be familiar\nto you a little bit.\n\n28\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.010\nBut widgets are a small collection and\ngroup of functionality\n\n29\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.260\nthat you can give to an end user and tell\nthem, hey, put this wherever you want.\n\n30\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.360\nSounds a little bit like short codes,\nthere's some distinctions there.\n\n31\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.500\nOne is, there's widget areas.\n\n32\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.760\nSo before we had short codes, and\n\n33\n00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.300\nthey could put short codes wherever they\nwanted to output some code that we define.\n\n34\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.180\nWidgets, there's predefined widget areas.\n\n35\n00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.540\nAnd this is usually after the theme,\nand we could add them, but\n\n36\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.540\nthat's beyond the scope of this episode.\n\n37\n00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.700\nAnd so you can think of,\nmaybe you've come across sidebars before,\n\n38\n00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.110\nor you've come across footers before, and\npeople can have different components, or\n\n39\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.200\nfunctionality there.\n\n40\n00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.560\nSo for example, you might have come across\na website, and along the right side or\n\n41\n00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.950\nthe left side there's a sidebar.\n\n42\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.990\nThere might be recent posts,\nrecent comments.\n\n43\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.090\nThere might be a calendar object, there\nmight be, learn more about this author.\n\n44\n00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.820\nThere might be a Twitter feed.\n\n45\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.630\nThese are all examples of widgets or\ncomponents that are within their sidebar.\n\n46\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.890\nAnd the footer might be an area that\nhas their recent Instagram photos, or\n\n47\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.630\nit might be a Contact Us section.\n\n48\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.010\nThere might be just some general links or\n\n49\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.480\nmaybe another form or\nthings along those lines.\n\n50\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.310\nThose would be different widgets\nthat are in different widget areas.\n\n51\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.430\nSo right now,\nwe're gonna define our own widgets, so\n\n52\n00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.795\nin our sub screen, and\nbefore we jump into actual code,\n\n53\n00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:33.500\nlet's take a look at where these\nwidget exit and what we do with these.\n\n54\n00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.550\nSo within the WordPress,\nthere is a page for widgets.\n\n55\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.460\nSo everything we are about to do we don't\nhave to worry about building the settings,\n\n56\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.850\nwe don't have to worry about\nbuilding these widget areas,\n\n57\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.400\nthis is all done for you.\n\n58\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.230\nSo we're gonna hop over to WordPress\nwidgets in the WordPress menu.\n\n59\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.800\nAnd what we have here, what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna, let's close this menu to\n\n60\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.710\ngive us a little bit more space, and\nwhat we can see here is a widget area.\n\n61\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.870\nIn the theme that I have installed,\nthere's only one widget area,\n\n62\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.820\nthis is the sidebar/ In some things, you\nmight have a side bar, you might have two\n\n63\n00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.830\nside bars, you might have a header widget\narea, you may have a footer widget area.\n\n64\n00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.000\nSo it could be multiple areas and this,\nI being an end user I can drag and\n\n65\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.150\ndrop and rearrange these,\nso I have a recent post.\n\n66\n00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.620\nOr maybe I don't want that,\nmaybe I want that on my footer,\n\n67\n00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.810\nI could drag that to the footer,\nor I can just get rid of it.\n\n68\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.820\nMaybe recent comments,\nsame thing, archives,\n\n69\n00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.840\nwe're gonna get rid of all of these.\n\n70\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.390\nLet's keep search categories in meta.\n\n71\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.200\nThen we can go to the front\nend of our website, and\n\n72\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.720\nwe can see that I do not\nhave widgets enabled.\n\n73\n00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.460\nSo, let me see.\n\n74\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.770\nLet me zoom out just a hair.\n\n75\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.210\nThere we go.\n\n76\n00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.330\nSo, in this case the theme\nhas the sidebar on the left.\n\n77\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.210\nAnd there is our search categories and\nmeta.\n\n78\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.217\nSo, and if we drag and drop and we arrange\nthese, we can drag and drop this way,\n\n79\n00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:56.698\nwe can bring out a calendar and\nwe are outputting something somewhere.\n\n80\n00:03:56.698 --> 00:03:59.594\nI think it's our plugin, so let me,\nwe're not gonna use any of this so\n\n81\n00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:01.066\nlet me just delete it for a second and\n\n82\n00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:05.230\nsee if it's that causing the-\n&gt;&gt; I like to live on the edge as well.\n\n83\n00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.030\nWhen in doubt, delete it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's some-\n\n84\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.520\n&gt;&gt; I've heard there's two ways to make\n\n85\n00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.160\ncode run.\n\n86\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.440\nWrite ore code, or delete code.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n87\n00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.490\nWe had something output somewhere.\n\n88\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.980\nI was not about to find out where it was.\n\n89\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.940\nSo let's just jump right into, so\nwe're just going to say my calendar.\n\n90\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.880\nAnd then we're going to click save.\n\n91\n00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.250\nWe'll hop out back to the front end.\n\n92\n00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.310\nRefresh it.\n\n93\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.100\nNow we have my calendar,\nwe don't have any posts or anything so\n\n94\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.180\nthere's not actually gonna to\nbe anything to show there.\n\n95\n00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.360\nYou'll see our title.\n\n96\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.760\nThis is an example of widgets, and\nthen I can go in, I could rearrange these,\n\n97\n00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.310\nI could edit some options to it,\nI can put these in other places.\n\n98\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.720\nSo maybe you want to add something new.\n\n99\n00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.660\nMaybe you want to add a Twitter feed,\nso you want to build a Twitter feed and\n\n100\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.140\nyou want to be able to build it into a\nwidget, and then the user, your client, or\n\n101\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.570\nyou or someone else, can put it\nsomewhere they can drag and drop it,\n\n102\n00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.360\nthey can rename the title.\n\n103\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.580\nMaybe you want to configure, they have\nan option to say how many recent tweets.\n\n104\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.410\nMaybe you want to have a contact form\nwidget that can hack place somewhere.\n\n105\n00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.410\nThings along those lines.\n\n106\n00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.350\nThere's so many times you want\nto create your own widget.\n\n107\n00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.280\nSo that is what we're gonna do.\n\n108\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.880\nSo real quick,\nthe general term is the widgets API and\n\n109\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.340\nthis is,\nthere's a lot of different things in here.\n\n110\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.500\nWe're going to, let's go pass all of that\nfor right now to look at this class.\n\n111\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.560\nSo we're gonna copy and paste this.\n\n112\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.680\nAnd then we're gonna build into it, but,\n\n113\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.620\nwell I thought we were\ngonna probably paste it.\n\n114\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.120\nThere it goes.\n\n115\n00:05:26.022 --> 00:05:30.040\nWe're gonna copy and\npaste this into our now blank file.\n\n116\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.190\nAnd then let's take a look through this.\n\n117\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.120\nSo the WordPress system\nhas this WP widget class.\n\n118\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.300\nAnd this is, if you're coming from another\nframework you'll probably have components\n\n119\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.240\nbefore.\n\n120\n00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.470\nSo this is like a widget component\nthat we are going to extend.\n\n121\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.610\nNow if you have never heard of components\nbefore, then essentially this is a group\n\n122\n00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.280\nof functions that go together\nthat we can then build on top of.\n\n123\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.920\nSo in our case we're gonna\njust call it my widget.\n\n124\n00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.190\nAnd we're gonna extend their\nexisting functions, WP widget.\n\n125\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.810\nNow inside, you're gonna have\na few different functions, and\n\n126\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.040\nwe'll go over each of these in just\na moment as we build this out.\n\n127\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.200\nWe have our construct function, we have a\nwidget function, we have a form functions,\n\n128\n00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.030\nand then we have an update function.\n\n129\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.890\nSo the construct function is\nwhat sets up this function.\n\n130\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.407\nIn our case, you don't need,\nthey're right here, but we're gonna keep\n\n131\n00:06:19.407 --> 00:06:24.139\nit there just so you can see how this all\nplays out, and we're gonna change this\n\n132\n00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.961\ntitle to my awesome widget just so\nwe can see how that plays out.\n\n133\n00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:31.917\nAnd then once we have our class setup,\n\n134\n00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:35.330\nbefore we set anything else\nup we need to register it.\n\n135\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.070\nNow first, I'm gonna copy and paste this.\n\n136\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.220\nAnd then I'll explain something that you,\nthat is unfortunate for\n\n137\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.480\nus as WordPress developers.\n\n138\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.370\nSo let me drop this in.\n\n139\n00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.290\nAnd did we call it my_widget?\n\n140\n00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.180\nYeah, we'll just keep it.\n\n141\n00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.800\nActually just in case, I don't think I\nhave any other plugins installed, but\n\n142\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.660\njust in case we're gonna change that\nprefix so we don't crash any websites.\n\n143\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.410\nBut we've talked about hooks quite a bit\nand before we had an admin menu hook,\n\n144\n00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.150\nwe had the admin hook that\nwe registered settings into.\n\n145\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.240\nFor widgets, there's the widgets and input\nand once WordPress gets the widgets in it,\n\n146\n00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.700\nthat's where it's expecting all of\nyour widget functionality to be.\n\n147\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.680\nAnd that's where you can register your\nwidgets by adding your class into\n\n148\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.130\nthe widget array or Once you're here,\nthis will look great.\n\n149\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.550\nBut, this thing we're doing here,\n\n150\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.950\nby having the function within the add\naction, that did not exist until phb 5.3.\n\n151\n00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.870\nWord Press still supports Word Press 5.2\n\n152\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.470\nwhich hasn't received security\nupdates in almost ten years.\n\n153\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.370\nSo if you are releasing this\nthrough the general public,\n\n154\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.476\nthere's a chance you probably\nneed to support HB 5.2.\n\n155\n00:07:38.476 --> 00:07:43.770\nSo that is where You could copy and\npaste this line instead, so.\n\n156\n00:07:47.246 --> 00:07:50.571\nAnd we're gonna drop in our FC there.\n\n157\n00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:52.722\nSo like I said, this create function,\n\n158\n00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.857\nthis is a PHP function that\ncreates a function on the fly.\n\n159\n00:07:55.857 --> 00:07:57.520\nAnd then returns that instead.\n\n160\n00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.004\nSo what we had before was something\ncalled anonymous functions,\n\n161\n00:08:00.004 --> 00:08:01.820\npage 3 terms that we're\nnot going to get into.\n\n162\n00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.238\nBut, essentially,\nthat wasn't available til 5.3.\n\n163\n00:08:04.238 --> 00:08:06.840\nSo if you're releasing this\non the mass market and\n\n164\n00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.870\nyou wanna support 5.2,\nthen you would have to do it this way.\n\n165\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.600\nIf this is for a client and\n\n166\n00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.850\nyou've updated anything within the last\n15 years, then you're probably okay.\n\n167\n00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.272\nSo it's just something to be\naware of as you go into this.\n\n168\n00:08:17.272 --> 00:08:18.940\nSo we're gonna keep it the old way,\n\n169\n00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.390\njust cuz we already have it there.\n&gt;&gt; Frank, this makes me feel kinda dirty.\n\n170\n00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.930\nI don't like,\nI like the internal [INAUDIBLE] is fine,\n\n171\n00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.150\nI understand the impetus of it,\nI understand why you would do it.\n\n172\n00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.690\nBut the create function, and\nyou're giving the function,\n\n173\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.260\nlike the return part of the function,\nit feels kinda weird to me, Frank.\n\n174\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.430\nFeels kinda weird.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n175\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.090\ntheoretically we could have built out\nlike an actual function to do that.\n\n176\n00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.110\nWe just used create\nfunction to simplify it.\n\n177\n00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.950\nBut like I said, in most, in a lot\nof cases if you're building this for\n\n178\n00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.340\na client website,\nyou know what version of PHP they have,\n\n179\n00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.200\nand PHP 5.2 is less than\n5% of WordPress sites.\n\n180\n00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.560\nSo you could have your plug-in\nhave a minimum version,\n\n181\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.400\nand then you could just avoid this.\n\n182\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.918\nBut it's just something to be aware of, as\nWordPress officially still supports 5.2.\n\n183\n00:08:59.918 --> 00:09:01.470\nIt's just something that\nwe have to be aware of.\n\n184\n00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.110\nSo now,\ntechnically we have our widget registered.\n\n185\n00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.290\nAnd we can actually come up here.\n\n186\n00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.590\nWe have in our construct, this parent.\n\n187\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.677\nThis is a PHP concept that you might not\nhave encountered if you haven't played\n\n188\n00:09:14.677 --> 00:09:15.439\nwith classes yet.\n\n189\n00:09:15.439 --> 00:09:19.745\nAnd essentially we're calling\nthe constructor function of our parent,\n\n190\n00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:23.380\nwhich is wp_widget, and\nwe're passing it RID.\n\n191\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.410\nSo in our cases, the my_widget is like\nour widget's log, or widget ID for\n\n192\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.460\nour specific widget.\n\n193\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.910\nWe're passing in the title,\nand in turn arguments.\n\n194\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.410\nSo in this case a class name and\na description.\n\n195\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.400\nThat you could remove this.\n\n196\n00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.670\nThe arguments are optional for\nthe widget for\n\n197\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.240\nthis part, but it doesn't hurt to have\nthe class name and description in there.\n\n198\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.120\nSo now, the widget function\nis what outputs the widget.\n\n199\n00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.370\nSo on the outside, let me jump back\nover here, see I can explain here.\n\n200\n00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.490\nThe widget function\ndefines what we see here.\n\n201\n00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.390\nWhereas the form function,\nthat we're about to look into,\n\n202\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.760\nis what defines what goes here.\n\n203\n00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.664\nAnd the last function, the update\nfunction, when we click the Save button,\n\n204\n00:10:04.664 --> 00:10:06.237\nit calls the update function.\n\n205\n00:10:06.237 --> 00:10:08.280\nSo those three all kinda go together.\n\n206\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.100\nBut one displays the output,\none displays the form, the settings.\n\n207\n00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.880\nAnd then one handles the update\nof any settings you have.\n\n208\n00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.948\nSo, in our case, just to get things going,\n\n209\n00:10:20.948 --> 00:10:27.685\nwe actually are gonna copy and\npaste this one just to make things easy.\n\n210\n00:10:27.685 --> 00:10:29.060\nAnd then we can explain this part.\n\n211\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.510\nSo the arguments of the widget.\n\n212\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.880\nThere's a lot of different things that we,\nthat before we talked about hooks and\n\n213\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.520\nfilters and things.\n\n214\n00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.330\nThere's different plugins and themes that\ncan hook into the separators between\n\n215\n00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.673\nwidgets, the classes on a widget box.\n\n216\n00:10:47.673 --> 00:10:51.460\nThe titles, changing the HTML\ntags that are around widgets.\n\n217\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.300\nSo we use a before_widget, before_title,\nand after_widget statements here.\n\n218\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.641\nThat way, if hypothetically, right now,\nI wanna say it's outputting as H4.\n\n219\n00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:05.608\nLet's see here.\n\n220\n00:11:05.608 --> 00:11:06.660\nIt's going to be super small.\n\n221\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:14.280\nIt's outputting as H2,\nand you could change that.\n\n222\n00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.979\nWhy is that not going?\n\n223\n00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:18.709\n[INAUDIBLE] You can change that\nto switch those to maybe divs, or\n\n224\n00:11:18.709 --> 00:11:20.470\nmaybe you wanna add extra classes to it.\n\n225\n00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.710\nMaybe you wanna add some extra,\nmaybe you wanna add icons before it.\n\n226\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.080\nPeople could do that using some filters\nthat are attached to certain ones,\n\n227\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.530\nbefore title, before widget.\n\n228\n00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:33.726\nThat's why it's best\npractice to use those.\n\n229\n00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:36.551\nOur particular code.\n\n230\n00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:40.707\nIn a second we're gonna be defining over\nhere in the calendar, there's a spot for\n\n231\n00:11:40.707 --> 00:11:44.580\ntitle and\nyou can allow the user to change that.\n\n232\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.710\nSo we're gonna do that\ntoo in just a moment, but\n\n233\n00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.010\nthen this instance, that is where\nyour data from that form is stored.\n\n234\n00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.031\nSo if we have a Twitter feed and\nwe have the name of,\n\n235\n00:11:53.031 --> 00:11:54.476\nyou don't wanna have a name there,\n\n236\n00:11:54.476 --> 00:11:57.815\nyou wanna be able to change what Twitter\nhandle we're pulling it from and amount.\n\n237\n00:11:57.815 --> 00:12:00.723\nWe would have three\ndifferent field options,\n\n238\n00:12:00.723 --> 00:12:04.870\nand then that data is stored\ninto this instance array.\n\n239\n00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.770\nSo down here we have our instance title,\nwhich we'll be building in the backend in\n\n240\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:14.560\njust a moment, and we are echoing\nout that title into our widget.\n\n241\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.930\nAnd then inside the widget\nwe're just saying Hello World!\n\n242\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.350\nFor now, let's go ahead and\nbuild that format, so\n\n243\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.310\nwe can see what that looks like.\n\n244\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.570\nWe'll just copy and since they already\nhave this amazing one right here.\n\n245\n00:12:28.546 --> 00:12:29.940\nWe're gonna take these guys.\n\n246\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.130\nNow, again the instance\n\n247\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.570\nis the collection of your data\nthat's stored with this widget.\n\n248\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.090\nSo in our case, we're gonna have just\nthe title that they can come in,\n\n249\n00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.340\nthey can customize and change.\n\n250\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:46.900\nAnd so, in our instance we have our title,\nand, too far, too far, go back up.\n\n251\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.762\nSo what we're checking is hey,\nif this title doesn't exist yet,\n\n252\n00:12:50.762 --> 00:12:54.065\nif this is the first time this widget's\nbeing initialized in this website, or\n\n253\n00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.936\nsomething along those lines,\nwe're just gonna put in a new title.\n\n254\n00:12:56.936 --> 00:13:00.720\nAnd if it already exists, then we're\njust gonna pull in the instance title.\n\n255\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.910\nAnd then down here is where we add our\nlabel and our input, which, if you look\n\n256\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.792\nback at our calendar, it'll look\nsomewhat like this once we're finished,\n\n257\n00:13:07.792 --> 00:13:09.980\nwe have our title in our calendar.\n\n258\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.010\nSo we could go in here and\nwe could change whatever we wanted.\n\n259\n00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.520\nWe could add, say, my title.\n\n260\n00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:18.501\nMy title.\n\n261\n00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:27.440\nWe can then, so here, if you look there's\na lot of different things going on here.\n\n262\n00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.640\nBut the title that we\nstore in the contents, or\n\n263\n00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.370\nthe value, we're gonna echo\nout as the value in our field.\n\n264\n00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.860\nBut then you'll notice there's\nsome other things here.\n\n265\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.366\nWe have this get_field_name,\nwe have get_field_id.\n\n266\n00:13:39.366 --> 00:13:44.263\nSo these are special widget functions\nwithin this my widget and wb widget class,\n\n267\n00:13:44.263 --> 00:13:47.863\nthat allows us to put all these together,\noutput the IDs and\n\n268\n00:13:47.863 --> 00:13:50.256\nnames of our different fields of HTML.\n\n269\n00:13:50.256 --> 00:13:53.804\nSo in this case, we're saying hey, we're\ngetting this specific one is the title.\n\n270\n00:13:53.804 --> 00:13:58.794\nAnd you would usually want these to\nbe the same as your arrays, options.\n\n271\n00:13:58.794 --> 00:14:02.696\nSo you're in our instance, we have title,\nusually that would match the IDs and\n\n272\n00:14:02.696 --> 00:14:03.750\nthe names.\n\n273\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.020\nAnd that way, they know where this gets\nstored and how this all works together.\n\n274\n00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.080\nDoes that sorta make sense\nhow those fits together?\n\n275\n00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a common paradigm that\n\n276\n00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.260\nwe actually see a lot more\nof today in the web world,\n\n277\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.170\nwhere we have these very specific API's,\nand we're extending the class or\n\n278\n00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:23.230\nsome data structure, and\nthen you're utilizing the defined API.\n\n279\n00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:28.370\nSo I think if you've been inside of\nthe web development field at any\n\n280\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:33.290\npoint within the last, what, two years,\nyou've probably got a good grasp of this.\n\n281\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.080\nSo this is pretty straightforward.\n\n282\n00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.211\nAt least, for me, it is, and\nI don't even really know the PHP that\n\n283\n00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:39.030\nwell.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n284\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.690\nIt's been definitely, in today's world,\nit's a lot more common.\n\n285\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.480\nBack when this was built,\nit wasn't quite as common.\n\n286\n00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.230\nBut if this is still your first\ntime into any web development,\n\n287\n00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.000\nit might be a little bit off putting.\n\n288\n00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.050\nBut the big takeaway is your instance\nholds the data for your widget.\n\n289\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:59.180\nAnd then these different ID's and\nnames, you wanna align these up so\n\n290\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.590\nit knows how to save these different\nfields of the settings into that instance,\n\n291\n00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.300\nso you can use it.\n\n292\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.400\nNow there's a couple things that if you\nwere in our last episode with escaping,\n\n293\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.160\nyou'll notice we escaped\nthe attributes here.\n\n294\n00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.730\nDefinitely something you always wanna do.\n\n295\n00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.170\nNow if you took a peek you might have\nnoticed these special things with text\n\n296\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.220\ndomains.\n\n297\n00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.390\nWe'll get to that in a future episode,\nthat's for translation purposes.\n\n298\n00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.080\nBut it's best practice\nto always have those.\n\n299\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.200\nBut we'll get to those in the future, so\n\n300\n00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.180\ndon't worry if you have no\nidea what that part is.\n\n301\n00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.430\nRight now, we just wanna make\nsure the escape's there.\n\n302\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.495\nAnd they're using those widget functions.\n\n303\n00:15:32.495 --> 00:15:34.140\nSo the last part is the update function.\n\n304\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.890\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\njust make things easy, we'll copy and\n\n305\n00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:37.646\npaste that too.\n\n306\n00:15:37.646 --> 00:15:45.050\nAs opposed to just typing it all out,\nwe'll drop that down here.\n\n307\n00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.172\nAnd, so what this is, is it passes\na new instance and an old instance.\n\n308\n00:15:49.172 --> 00:15:51.430\nNow Wordpress could theoretically\ndo this part for us.\n\n309\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.310\nIt could just go hey these\nsettings replace those settings.\n\n310\n00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.601\nBut maybe you need to validate in a way,\n\n311\n00:15:56.601 --> 00:16:00.081\nmaybe you need to sanitize Maybe\nyou need to adjust things.\n\n312\n00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:02.960\nSo maybe if they typed in\na particular Twitter handle,\n\n313\n00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.972\nyou need to format it in a certain way.\n\n314\n00:16:04.972 --> 00:16:07.193\nSo they expose this process, so\n\n315\n00:16:07.193 --> 00:16:11.571\nyou can build your own code during\nthis and save it your own way.\n\n316\n00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:16.149\nSo the goal is to return an instance,\nwhich represents all the data for\n\n317\n00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:17.086\nyour widget.\n\n318\n00:16:17.086 --> 00:16:21.080\nSo we could, we have our new instance and\nour old instance.\n\n319\n00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.688\nSo what we're doing is saying, hey,\nif the new title is empty or not empty,\n\n320\n00:16:25.688 --> 00:16:27.416\nwe wanna strip out the tags.\n\n321\n00:16:27.416 --> 00:16:30.560\nMaybe we wanna do some sanitization\nthere or we wanna replace it, and\n\n322\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.710\nthen we could return it.\n\n323\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.860\nOr maybe you had some sort\nof other old instance and\n\n324\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.880\nyou wanna verify things against that.\n\n325\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.330\nYou could play with both the old\ninstance and new instance.\n\n326\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.800\nFor us, we just need the new title.\n\n327\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.740\nSo we're not even gonna even\nplay with the old instance.\n\n328\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.630\nBut theoretically, you could play\nwith those if you have things that\n\n329\n00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.570\nyou need to convert or\nchange when a setting has changed.\n\n330\n00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.861\nDoes that sort of make sense?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could see this being used for\n\n331\n00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:55.557\nmaybe there's things that you need\nvalidations for, to make sure\n\n332\n00:16:55.557 --> 00:17:00.310\nthat the inputs are actually what people\nare inputting, like you said with Twitter.\n\n333\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.316\nI'm thinking email, for some reason,\nI always go with email.\n\n334\n00:17:03.316 --> 00:17:05.863\nIf you're looking for\nI need to look at this email or\n\n335\n00:17:05.863 --> 00:17:07.850\nthis is something associated.\n\n336\n00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.232\nBut also, I guess you could\neven do limitations, right?\n\n337\n00:17:11.232 --> 00:17:13.360\nLet's say you have a date, right?\n\n338\n00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.250\nYou're looking for a certain date.\n\n339\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.290\nAnd for whatever reason you say,\n\n340\n00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.640\nyou can't change this data by\nmore than five days at a time.\n\n341\n00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.936\nThen you could do additional\nvalidations and do those checks.\n\n342\n00:17:24.936 --> 00:17:27.801\nIn turn of all that, and\nthen have some kind of fall back and\n\n343\n00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:30.667\nreturn that new instance, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly and\n\n344\n00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:34.687\nthat would be several examples there with\nvalidation, so that's why this is exposed.\n\n345\n00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:39.094\nTheoretically, like I said,\ninside this, just return new instance.\n\n346\n00:17:39.094 --> 00:17:42.012\nProbably shouldn't, you probably should\ndo some sort of valuation, especially at\n\n347\n00:17:42.012 --> 00:17:45.140\nleast to check to see if it's empty or\nnot, like we're doing here with the title.\n\n348\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.100\nBut the goal is to return an instance\nof your widget to settings.\n\n349\n00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.690\n&gt;&gt; Now a couple of questions about this.\n\n350\n00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.315\nWe've seen instance,\nnew instance, old instance.\n\n351\n00:17:54.315 --> 00:17:56.766\nWhen I think of instance,\nI actually think of an object.\n\n352\n00:17:56.766 --> 00:18:01.560\nBut it looks like instance in this case is\njust the data associated with an object as\n\n353\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.890\nan array.\n\n354\n00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.658\nAm I correct in that assertion?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n355\n00:18:04.658 --> 00:18:07.594\nif you're coming from\nanother component framework,\n\n356\n00:18:07.594 --> 00:18:11.436\nthe word instance is usually\nthe initialized object of the component.\n\n357\n00:18:11.436 --> 00:18:14.660\nSo it has the component functions and\nvarious aspects.\n\n358\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:19.250\nThis instance, when you first adjust\nthe collection of settings or\n\n359\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.460\noptions attached to that widget.\n\n360\n00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.150\nSo in the instance itself,\nit is not an instance that you would find\n\n361\n00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.087\nin other componentized languages,\nor frameworks.\n\n362\n00:18:26.087 --> 00:18:28.980\nThis is more of just a collection\nof the actual settings.\n\n363\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.970\n&gt;&gt; Furthermore,\n\n364\n00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.632\nI noticed here in this example,\nthey create a new array.\n\n365\n00:18:33.632 --> 00:18:36.280\nThey set an attribute and\nthen they return that array.\n\n366\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.508\nHowever, if I were to take the new\ninstance and said, new instance, title,\n\n367\n00:18:42.508 --> 00:18:43.101\nequals.\n\n368\n00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:47.179\nI can essentially just change the instance\nto new instance on line 67 and\n\n369\n00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:50.120\nremove line 66 and\nthen return new instance.\n\n370\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.920\nIs there anything that keeps me better\nyet, is there a reason why I would\n\n371\n00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.974\nmutate the new instance array that's\npassed in and then just pass it back?\n\n372\n00:18:59.974 --> 00:19:03.811\nWhy are they creating a new one\njust to set the data attributes and\n\n373\n00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:06.700\nthen pass it back?\n&gt;&gt; Well this gets back to some security\n\n374\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.870\nflaws we face here.\n\n375\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.800\nThat you never know what new instance\nmay have, maybe someone added some\n\n376\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.480\nextra elements to that form and are\nsubmitting some malicious code with it.\n\n377\n00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.320\nWe can filter that out by saying or\ncreating a new array, and\n\n378\n00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.490\nwe only want the title attribute and\nthen return that.\n\n379\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.550\nSo this is a practice in security,\n\n380\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.800\nit's a little bit beyond the scope\nof this particular episode.\n\n381\n00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.140\nBut in a lot of times,\nwhenever you're submitting form data or\n\n382\n00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.080\nanything like that, a good practice\nis to initialize an array and\n\n383\n00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.390\nonly pick out the parts that you want.\n\n384\n00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.514\nAnd that way you don't get any extra\nset that might be maliciously.\n\n385\n00:19:37.514 --> 00:19:39.340\n&gt;&gt; Last question about this then.\n\n386\n00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.530\nIf we are to do that, which makes a valid\nreason in your explanation there.\n\n387\n00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:49.130\nIf we are to do that, then I'm gonna say\nour view function, our actual render,\n\n388\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.180\nour widget, how it's output.\n\n389\n00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.370\nAnd then the form the respective things\nthat are needed by those on instance,\n\n390\n00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.260\nso title here.\n\n391\n00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:04.330\nLet's say we had another one called name,\nor ID, or color, or something.\n\n392\n00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:09.010\nIn our update, we need to ensure\nthat those also have values for\n\n393\n00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.546\nthe instances of return, correct?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n394\n00:20:11.546 --> 00:20:15.515\nSo if we wanted to add another field here,\nwe could theoretically copy and\n\n395\n00:20:15.515 --> 00:20:19.140\npaste this, and\nchange all those to name or description.\n\n396\n00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.855\nAnd then we would also have to set it.\n\n397\n00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:22.110\nSo let's go ahead and just drop.\n\n398\n00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.242\nSo we'll go in and copy and\npaste that just so we can see.\n\n399\n00:20:25.242 --> 00:20:27.250\nSo we'll call this description.\n\n400\n00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.905\nSee if I can copy and paste in a way\nthat doesn't break everything.\n\n401\n00:20:33.443 --> 00:20:36.670\nAnd we go down here,\nwe'll change these to all description.\n\n402\n00:20:39.895 --> 00:20:43.781\nAnd I think I missed one.\n\n403\n00:20:43.781 --> 00:20:48.523\nThat, description, and\nthink I got them all.\n\n404\n00:20:48.523 --> 00:20:52.780\nAnd then down here,\nwe could just add an extra line here.\n\n405\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.089\nWe'll just copy and paste this.\n\n406\n00:20:57.879 --> 00:20:59.080\nChange this description,\n\n407\n00:21:06.322 --> 00:21:09.699\nAnd now we add another extra\nset into those widget.\n\n408\n00:21:09.699 --> 00:21:11.994\n&gt;&gt; So that's what I wanted to make sure,\n\n409\n00:21:11.994 --> 00:21:16.586\nwe need to make sure that what we're\nrelying on whether the form or the widget\n\n410\n00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:21.170\nmethods that if we do any updates\nwhen we're constructing a new array.\n\n411\n00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.151\nWe need to make sure that that data's\nalso pass through in order for\n\n412\n00:21:24.151 --> 00:21:27.787\nthose renders, essentially that rendering\nto work appropriately, correct?\n\n413\n00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:28.586\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n414\n00:21:28.586 --> 00:21:29.344\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n415\n00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:31.460\nso as long as we got that all, be careful.\n\n416\n00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.979\nI could see that being\nhorrible like Heisenbug,\n\n417\n00:21:33.979 --> 00:21:36.999\nI don't know why this isn't\nworking gotta figure it out.\n\n418\n00:21:36.999 --> 00:21:39.650\nBut always keep those in\nthe forefront of your mind.\n\n419\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.610\nBut this makes a fair amount of\nsense based on my background.\n\n420\n00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:48.887\nDoesn't seem too terribly difficult,\nbut what else do we, I feel like you're\n\n421\n00:21:48.887 --> 00:21:53.084\nabout to spring some shenanigans on us.\n&gt;&gt; Well not quite, but let's go in and\n\n422\n00:21:53.084 --> 00:21:56.650\nadd the description to the output, just so\nwe can see one more example there.\n\n423\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:02.622\nWe'll go ahead and replace this hello\nworld, and we'll pretend that is our, So\n\n424\n00:22:02.622 --> 00:22:07.095\nwe'll echo out our description and\nthe new description that we just put.\n\n425\n00:22:07.095 --> 00:22:10.395\nSo we wanna escape that, so\nwe're gonna say esc_html.\n\n426\n00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:12.850\nAnd we're gonna change this description,\n\n427\n00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:23.330\nAnd if that is not defined, were just\ngonna echo out, just no description.\n\n428\n00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.810\nJust so\nwe can have any checks just in case.\n\n429\n00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.955\nIt's not likely we'll get to that point,\nbut just in case.\n\n430\n00:22:29.955 --> 00:22:35.147\nAll right, [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; It looks like there's a curly brace or\n\n431\n00:22:35.147 --> 00:22:37.164\nindentation chain or something, but\n\n432\n00:22:37.164 --> 00:22:41.270\nI'm not sure-\n&gt;&gt; I think I accidentally, there we go.\n\n433\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.522\nOkay, that looks right, I don't know what\nI must have backed it up at some point.\n\n434\n00:22:44.522 --> 00:22:47.774\nAll right, now that it's created,\nit's registered.\n\n435\n00:22:47.774 --> 00:22:50.260\nTheoretically it should now\nshow up in our widgets API.\n\n436\n00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.550\nSo let's hop over here and refresh\npage and see if we get [INAUDIBLE].\n\n437\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.368\nWhat did we call this, my widget?\n\n438\n00:22:58.368 --> 00:23:00.819\nAll right, awesome,\nokay let's see [INAUDIBLE].\n\n439\n00:23:00.819 --> 00:23:01.549\nThere's our My Awesome Widget.\n\n440\n00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:04.066\nSo we can come up here,\nlook at the description underneath it,\n\n441\n00:23:04.066 --> 00:23:06.640\nMy Widget is Awesome,\nthat lines up with the description here.\n\n442\n00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.740\nThen we can drag and drop this up to\nour widget area, right up top here.\n\n443\n00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.540\nAnd there's our title and description and\n\n444\n00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.204\nthat new stuff is coming from our form,\nwhere we set it.\n\n445\n00:23:18.204 --> 00:23:21.520\nIf it did not already exist,\nthen we put new title and new description.\n\n446\n00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:29.743\nAnd that is is there, so we're gonna\nchange this to cool stuff and watch this.\n\n447\n00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:31.859\nAnd we're gonna Save,\nand when we hit Save,\n\n448\n00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:34.360\nthe saving,\nthat calls the update function.\n\n449\n00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.840\nWhat we're looking at\ncalls that form function.\n\n450\n00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.607\nAnd now we come out, oop,\ncome out to the outside.\n\n451\n00:23:41.607 --> 00:23:42.387\nOur cool stuff,\n\n452\n00:23:42.387 --> 00:23:45.460\nwatch this is there because\nthe widget function is being called.\n\n453\n00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.389\nSo you see now how all those correlate and\n\n454\n00:23:47.389 --> 00:23:49.165\nwe've created our widget.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n455\n00:23:49.165 --> 00:23:53.455\nthat seems pretty straightforward,\nand I can definitely see the utility,\n\n456\n00:23:53.455 --> 00:23:56.135\nkind of late bill a bunch\nof things that I can then\n\n457\n00:23:56.135 --> 00:24:00.410\ncomposed into the respective UI and\ninteractions that I hope to get.\n\n458\n00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:05.754\nAny additional concerns,\nconsiderations we need to make for\n\n459\n00:24:05.754 --> 00:24:10.593\ncreating widgets or modifying widgets?\n&gt;&gt; No, the thing to be aware of\n\n460\n00:24:10.593 --> 00:24:14.299\nthough is that they can put these widgets\nwherever the theme defines which areas.\n\n461\n00:24:14.299 --> 00:24:16.710\nSo this might not always be\nthe side bar like what we had here.\n\n462\n00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.600\nThis could be the footer,\n\n463\n00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.560\nthis could be the header,\nthis could be all over the place.\n\n464\n00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.400\nSometimes certain themes have a widget\narea underneath each blog post.\n\n465\n00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.312\nSo these are things to keep in\nmind when your building this, so\n\n466\n00:24:27.312 --> 00:24:29.832\nmaybe you might wanna either\nhave to make it smaller or\n\n467\n00:24:29.832 --> 00:24:32.083\nmaybe I wanted to have\nthis massive thing here.\n\n468\n00:24:32.083 --> 00:24:35.258\nIf they want to put this in a footer\nsomewhere that may not make sense.\n\n469\n00:24:35.258 --> 00:24:38.758\nSo being aware of where they can put\nthese might define how you can design\n\n470\n00:24:38.758 --> 00:24:41.875\nthe output.\n&gt;&gt; So does that mean when we're building\n\n471\n00:24:41.875 --> 00:24:47.050\nthese widgets, should we have a target\narea during our considerations?\n\n472\n00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.873\nOr is that something where I'm\ngonna have this widget, but\n\n473\n00:24:49.873 --> 00:24:52.361\nthere may be a footter version,\na sidebar version.\n\n474\n00:24:52.361 --> 00:24:53.372\nIs that possible?\n\n475\n00:24:53.372 --> 00:24:56.315\nNot necessarily with\nexactly the same name, but\n\n476\n00:24:56.315 --> 00:25:00.836\nmaybe we have a widget that targets\na specific area that it would reside with\n\n477\n00:25:00.836 --> 00:25:03.680\nthem.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's entirely up to the user, so\n\n478\n00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.530\ntheoretically, you could just build the\none and if they realize it's really big,\n\n479\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.610\nthey decide not to put it somewhere\nbecause that's their choice.\n\n480\n00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.709\nSo it really depends\non what your building,\n\n481\n00:25:12.709 --> 00:25:15.500\nif your building a get a quote form,\nfor whatever reason.\n\n482\n00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.699\nAnd it has ten fields, there's not\nreally a way that you can minimize that.\n\n483\n00:25:18.699 --> 00:25:20.365\nSo that would be up to the user to decide,\n\n484\n00:25:20.365 --> 00:25:22.430\nhey, this doesn't make\nsense to have this here.\n\n485\n00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.140\nI should put it somewhere else,\nnot in the header.\n\n486\n00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.921\nBut there's also ways that you could say,\nhey,\n\n487\n00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:27.452\nI'm gonna build two separate versions.\n\n488\n00:25:27.452 --> 00:25:30.640\nThe big version and the small version,\nI'm putting like a Twitter feed.\n\n489\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.020\nYou can have two different widgets\nthat do the same functionality, but\n\n490\n00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.810\nhave them designed for different sizes or\n\n491\n00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.223\ndifferent places.\n&gt;&gt; And that makes sense,\n\n492\n00:25:38.223 --> 00:25:39.924\nthat's very much context based, right?\n\n493\n00:25:39.924 --> 00:25:43.313\nLike you said, I'm a big form\nthat I need all the information.\n\n494\n00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:45.050\nThere's not a lot you can do about it.\n\n495\n00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.485\nBut with the Twitter feed\ninstead of showing the last 15,\n\n496\n00:25:48.485 --> 00:25:49.797\nI just show the top 3.\n\n497\n00:25:49.797 --> 00:25:52.260\nOr reduce it, maybe I can get\na little more real estate there.\n\n498\n00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.730\nSo things to think about and\nthese widgets, I can see how this\n\n499\n00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.430\nmight just be fun to play around with,\nsee what you can come up with.\n\n500\n00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.884\nAnd pretty quick and\neasy to get started as far as,\n\n501\n00:26:01.884 --> 00:26:04.930\nonce you get your plugin set up,\nyou just create your widget.\n\n502\n00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.010\nSee what you can do.\n\n503\n00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.750\nFigure things out.\n\n504\n00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.775\nBut we definitely got more WordPress that\nwe gotta learn before we can really start\n\n505\n00:26:11.775 --> 00:26:12.956\ndeep diving into this.\n\n506\n00:26:12.956 --> 00:26:16.550\nSo definitely come on back, but for\nthis episode, we are out of time.\n\n507\n00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.843\nSo signing off for DevProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n508\n00:26:19.843 --> 00:26:20.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Frank Corso.\n\n509\n00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.022\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n510\n00:26:23.022 --> 00:26:27.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

DevPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.440\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.120\nwe're continuing with our intro\nto WordPress development series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.440\nAnd what we're going to be talking about,\nremote URL's.\n\n6\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.450\nI feel like that's a loaded term but\n\n7\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.888\nwe have a very special person in the\nstudio today that will reveal all to us.\n\n8\n00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:35.943\nMr. Frank Corso,\nhow are you doing today Frank?\n\n9\n00:00:35.943 --> 00:00:37.313\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, how are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:38.160\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.990\nNow, remote URLs, I don't know.\n\n12\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.910\nIn my context, that means one thing,\nbut you're gonna have to let us know,\n\n13\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.140\nwhat does that mean in\nthe context of WordPress?\n\n14\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.760\n&gt;&gt; So when it comes to WordPress,\n\n15\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.860\nwe have our WordPress installation,\nwe're dong things.\n\n16\n00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.920\nThere's gonna be times that you\nwanna retrieve data or send data,\n\n17\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.980\nto another website, another URL,\nanother API, things along those lines.\n\n18\n00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.631\nFor example, you might be trying\nto integrate with MailChimp or\n\n19\n00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.730\nSendGrid, or any other providers.\n\n20\n00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.010\nYou might be trying to integrate with\nDigitalOcean or you might just be retrieve\n\n21\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.940\ndata from GitHub or Twitter or\nFacebook, things along those lines.\n\n22\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.290\nThere's many APIs out there that you might\nbe using, or even just other websites, or\n\n23\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.470\nyour own other properties\nwithin your own contract.\n\n24\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.670\nHow do we do that?\n\n25\n00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.790\nNow, if you are familiar with PHP or other\nlanguages, you might know there might be\n\n26\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.560\nsome other things we can do like Curl or\nWGET or something.\n\n27\n00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.810\nEspecially if you're releasing this,\n\n28\n00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.820\nyou don't know what's gonna be\ninstalled on other servers,\n\n29\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.692\non other websites, what time notes they\nhave, what kind of weird things they have.\n\n30\n00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:42.300\nSo WordPress has a system built for\nus that we can use,\n\n31\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.450\nthat makes it a lot easier and they worry\nabout most of the crazy headache stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.880\nSo let's jump to the laptop screen, and\n\n33\n00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.400\nwe're going to, first,\nwe have our random settings page.\n\n34\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.950\nI reverted it back to\nour original version.\n\n35\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.640\nAnd what we're going to do is first\nwe're going to output the contributor's\n\n36\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.790\nunderneath, like we did before.\n\n37\n00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.380\nAnd then we're going to walkthrough\nlike how does that actually\n\n38\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.240\nwork the remote part.\n\n39\n00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.600\nBut before we get to that,\nI just want to bring up the HTTP API,\n\n40\n00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.620\nis the actual API within WordPress that\nwe're going to be interacting with today.\n\n41\n00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.950\nAnd if we scroll down, there's going to\nbe a few different functions here, but\n\n42\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.990\nthey have functions to get.\n\n43\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.560\nIf you're familiar with HTML and\nposting and transferring data,\n\n44\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.320\nyou might be familiar with getting and\nposting.\n\n45\n00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.500\nWe've played with those a little bit.\n\n46\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.370\nBut essentially, getting is usually\nused for retrieving information and\n\n47\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.610\nposting is usually used for sending data.\n\n48\n00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.440\nThere's a lot more to it than that,\nso if you're not familiar with that,\n\n49\n00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.400\nthat'd be something to play around with.\n\n50\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.330\nBut what we're going to do, is we're going\nto scroll all the way down here past all\n\n51\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.740\nthese response codes, and we're going\nto be using wpremove GET to get data.\n\n52\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.440\nAnd what this does is, it gets this giant\narray, where it gives us the headers\n\n53\n00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.440\nthat it got from a URL, the body it got,\nthe response, any cookies, any file names.\n\n54\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.280\nit's going to give us all this\nwhenever we try to get our URL.\n\n55\n00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.420\nSo in our case, let me copy and\npaste something in to our settings page.\n\n56\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.190\nAnd we're just going to copy and\n\n57\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.280\npaste it at the bottom here, so\nwe can see what this looks like.\n\n58\n00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.380\nprint_r contributors,\nI don't think I defined that yet,\n\n59\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.100\nso let me just pop that up here in\ncase we get something weird going on.\n\n60\n00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.740\nAnd we'll take a look at this and\nwe'll explain what's going on.\n\n61\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.540\nSo we have this crazy array of a lot\nmore stuff that I was thing that it was.\n\n62\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.340\nSo what we're doing is getting the GitHub\ncontributors for a particular project.\n\n63\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.689\nAnd we did this in a previous episode but\nwe just dropped it also into a transient.\n\n64\n00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.260\nSo let's explain what\nwe actually were doing.\n\n65\n00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.360\nWe're gonna look at this function\nhere called wp remote get and\n\n66\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.380\nwhat this does is WordPress makes\na get call to a URL that you supply.\n\n67\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.260\nSo in this case, I'm supplying\na GitHub API URL that Dave gave.\n\n68\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.417\nThat if you look at GitHub,\nthey have all those crazy APIs, and\n\n69\n00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:59.007\none of them allows us to get\nthe contributors for a particular project.\n\n70\n00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:01.500\nSo in this case, that's what we're doing,\nwe're getting contributors for a project.\n\n71\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.326\nAnd we could pass some arguments to it,\nso in this case,\n\n72\n00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:11.813\nthis is a particular one to help us\nwork better with the GitHub API.\n\n73\n00:04:11.813 --> 00:04:16.852\nBut there's actually lots of ones that\nwe could pass, we could pass let me see,\n\n74\n00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:21.230\nthey should have an example,\npossibly of all the ones we could pass.\n\n75\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.030\nIn this case, we could pass different\nheaders like authorization.\n\n76\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.540\nSo maybe there's a particular username and\npassword we're gonna send over or\n\n77\n00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.610\na token, things along those lines.\n\n78\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.370\nI thought they had a massive list here.\n\n79\n00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.060\nThere we go, these are couple\nof things we could send over.\n\n80\n00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.120\nTime outs, redirections, HTTP version,\nblocking, headers, the body, cookies,\n\n81\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.470\nthings along those lines that you\nmight normally send in a get request.\n\n82\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.915\nIf you're familiar with those,\nyou can modify those, so\n\n83\n00:04:47.915 --> 00:04:51.900\ncertain APIs will ask you to make\nthe request in certain ways, so\n\n84\n00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.530\nyou use the arguments of this function\nto make those necessary changes.\n\n85\n00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.700\nAnd then what it returns is\nusually a few different things.\n\n86\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.570\nSo it's going to return that giant\narray that we were looking at.\n\n87\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.710\nBut sometimes, it might return\nsomething called a WP_Error.\n\n88\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.260\nNow we haven't gone over\nthese too much yet,\n\n89\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.880\nbut essentially, a WP_Error,\nthink of it like a larger exception.\n\n90\n00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.210\nSo in PHP there's exceptions,\nin WordPress there's WP_Errors\n\n91\n00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.300\nthat have a lot more to it, but\nthey're like exceptions in PHP.\n\n92\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.730\nAnd we can use this function\ncalled is_wp_error to check\n\n93\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.780\nif our response is an error.\n\n94\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.770\nSo if we call wp_remote_get and then it\ngets some weird error, then we can say,\n\n95\n00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.740\nhey, is this an error?\n\n96\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.190\nAnd if it's not, or if it is, then we\njust wanna store it as an empty array.\n\n97\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.000\nBecause we don't wanna try to decode\nsomething if it doesn't actually exist,\n\n98\n00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.350\nbecause then we'll get kinda\ncrazy errors going on.\n\n99\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.130\nSo we're gonna check if it's an error.\n\n100\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.260\nThen we wanna use this other function,\ncalled wp_remote_retrieve_response_code,\n\n101\n00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.390\nI know that's a mouthful.\n\n102\n00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.210\nBut essentially,\n\n103\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.380\nit's retrieving the HTTP code that we\nreturned when we tried to access that URL.\n\n104\n00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.590\nSo if you're not familiar with codes\ntoo much, we can come up here.\n\n105\n00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.590\nThere's this nice little table.\n\n106\n00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.650\nLet me scroll that just a hair so\nyou can see it.\n\n107\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.170\nSo anything in the 200s is usually\nsuccessful, anything in the 300s usually,\n\n108\n00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.760\nbecause URL is redirected.\n\n109\n00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.540\nAnything in the 400s usually bad,\nanything in the 500s usually is bad.\n\n110\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.480\nSo for different reasons,\n400s usually, anyways.\n\n111\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.400\nSo you can look at these codes and\n\n112\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.160\nyou can do different things\nbased on what's returned.\n\n113\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.835\nIn our case, if it's anything but 200,\nwe're knowing the GitHub API if it's\n\n114\n00:06:24.835 --> 00:06:28.047\nanything besides 200,\nwe know it probably failed.\n\n115\n00:06:28.047 --> 00:06:32.990\nSo in this case, if it's anything besides\n200, we just wanna create an empty array.\n\n116\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.615\nBecause we don't wanna try to retrieve\nanything, because we know the GitHub API\n\n117\n00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:39.550\nif it's anything besides 200,\nit's probably some crazy error message.\n\n118\n00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.780\nNow, knowing that, we probably\ncould have done something here.\n\n119\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.370\nWhere we retrieve it and\ntry to figure out what the error was so\n\n120\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.450\nwe could do display\nthat error to the user.\n\n121\n00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.771\nIn our case, that's not what we're after,\nbut that's what we could do.\n\n122\n00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:54.442\nSo for example, we could have some other\nretrieve response codes here and certain\n\n123\n00:06:54.442 --> 00:06:58.430\nAPIs will say, hey, if it's a 402, it's\nbecause it's a wrong username password,\n\n124\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.560\nor if it's a 403, it's because this.\n\n125\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.290\nSo you could check those codes and display\nrelevant error messages to your user.\n\n126\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.910\nIn our case,\nif we don't get our contributors,\n\n127\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.390\nwe don't want to explain anything,\nso that we just end it right there.\n\n128\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.080\nOr you could do more things right there.\n\n129\n00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.920\nNow the other thing we wanna look\nat is the wp_remote_retrieve_body.\n\n130\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.990\nSo before we looked at that giant array,\n\n131\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.520\nand you could go into this array and\nyou could pull out the body yourself.\n\n132\n00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.990\nOr that's what this function does, is\nessentially goes into the response array,\n\n133\n00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.170\ngrabs the body and returns it for\nyou, so you could do either way.\n\n134\n00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.900\nIt's usually best practice to\njust to use their functions, so\n\n135\n00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.620\nyou don't have to worry\nabout all those extra steps.\n\n136\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.560\nBut either ways, you'll get to the body.\n\n137\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.650\nAnd then, in our case,\nthey could have API return JSON.\n\n138\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.010\nA lot of API's in today's\nworld returns JSON.\n\n139\n00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.620\nThat's something you'll\nprobably encounter.\n\n140\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.790\nSo we just do a json_decode\ninto our contributors.\n\n141\n00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.040\nAnd that is how we ended\nup with this massive blob,\n\n142\n00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.120\nwhich was a lot more than I was expecting.\n\n143\n00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.140\nBut that is how we can\nremote get from the URL.\n\n144\n00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.120\nSo just a recap there,\nwp_remote_get gets a URL that you supply,\n\n145\n00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.960\nyou can parse arguments to it.\n\n146\n00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.010\nAnd then we use is_wp_error to\ncheck if there's an error, and\n\n147\n00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.990\nwe use wp_remote_retrieve_response\n_code to check the response code.\n\n148\n00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.310\nThen lastly, wp_remote_retrieve_body\nto get the contents of the body.\n\n149\n00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.210\nThat sort of make sense\nhow that flows together?\n\n150\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:15.980\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n151\n00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.500\nNow, we have this large chunk error,\n\n152\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.630\nI remember in a previous episode,\nwe didn't actually see like,\n\n153\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.380\nI think I misspoken, and said error,\nwe had a large chunk of data there.\n\n154\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.340\nWhat could we do with data?\n\n155\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.260\nLike why we have this data,\n\n156\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.940\nwhat are some common use cases of\nwhy I would want to go grab this?\n\n157\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.240\nI know you've said some, but\n\n158\n00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.568\nin this case, what would we do?\n&gt;&gt; So in this case, in a previous episode,\n\n159\n00:08:40.568 --> 00:08:43.020\nwe had the GitHub contributors listed.\n\n160\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.910\nSo maybe you're developing\na plug-in that's open source and\n\n161\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.850\nyou want a page that lists\ndown all of the contributors.\n\n162\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.950\nAnd that way you could say, hey,\nthis is credited to this person.\n\n163\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.850\nSo in our case, we could've done that, and\nwe could cycle through these contributors\n\n164\n00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.110\nand have a cool style with their image and\ntheir name, things along those lines.\n\n165\n00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.930\nYou could also use this\nto get the Twitter feed.\n\n166\n00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.939\nSo maybe you build a Twitter widget, and\nyou used wp_remote_get to get the Twitter\n\n167\n00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:06.172\ntweets, and then you could cycle\nthrough those and display those.\n\n168\n00:09:06.172 --> 00:09:09.844\nNow depending on other APIs, maybe you're\nintegrating with an email marketing\n\n169\n00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:13.680\nprovider, such as MailChimp or Constant\nContact, you could remote get that.\n\n170\n00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.730\nYou could remote get a listener, you could\nremote get the contacts, you could remote\n\n171\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.000\nget the different options and settings,\nand API keys, or things along those lines.\n\n172\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.850\nThat you could use that, and\n\n173\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.950\nthen do something with that actual return,\ninstead of displaying it.\n\n174\n00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.020\nDoes that give a few more examples?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n175\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.730\nIt's just one of those things where,\nyou're like, that's interesting because\n\n176\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.175\nthere's a lot of data there, but\nwe've already seen one of the end results,\n\n177\n00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:37.520\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n178\n00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.753\n&gt;&gt; It's definitely usable cuz you don't\n\n179\n00:09:39.753 --> 00:09:42.420\nwant to store all of this information.\n\n180\n00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.232\nNow, the one question, you said\nwp_remote_retrieve_body, that gives\n\n181\n00:09:47.232 --> 00:09:50.241\nyou the body of the request, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n182\n00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:51.790\n&gt;&gt; The result?\n\n183\n00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.670\nNow, from the result, or\nexcuse me, getting that body,\n\n184\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:03.700\nif I do brackets, quotes, body and just\ngrab that key, so I get the respective\n\n185\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.650\nbody off the response, is there any,\nis that how I would access that?\n\n186\n00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.530\nOr is there, it doesn't seem like,\n\n187\n00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.880\nthat's a long function name\njust to do that simple thing.\n\n188\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:19.440\nOr are there other things that are helping\nme behind the scenes in that function.\n\n189\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.550\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n190\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.910\nTo answer your question,\nyou could technically do this either way.\n\n191\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.430\nIt's just more of the standard practice.\n\n192\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.330\nIf we bring up the,\nthe developer docs here,\n\n193\n00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.150\nit'll pretty much show you that it's\npretty much the exact same thing.\n\n194\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.800\nRetrieve only the body\nfrom the raw response,\n\n195\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.870\nwhich is pretty much\nexactly what we're after.\n\n196\n00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.290\nAnd what they're doing is\njust an extra error check.\n\n197\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.520\nIt's pretty much doing\nexactly what you just said.\n\n198\n00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.430\nIt's checking to make sure,\nis there an error?\n\n199\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.040\nAnd if there isn't, and is the body set?\n\n200\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.550\nMaybe we got a request back\nthat doesn't have a body.\n\n201\n00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.460\nSo it's doing just an extra couple checks,\nbut at the end of the day it's just\n\n202\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.930\nreturning response body, which is exactly\nwhat you're asking if you can do.\n\n203\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:55.950\nSo you could skip this.\n\n204\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.810\nIt has an extra two checks in it.\n\n205\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.870\nSo depending on where you're\nputting this in your puzzle,\n\n206\n00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.490\nit might be worthwhile to have\nthose checks rather than you do it\n\n207\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.760\nyourself.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha,\n\n208\n00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.790\nI was just like it seems pretty simple,\nbut those little extra error checks,\n\n209\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.770\nthose can kinda add up if you\nneed to do a bunch of these.\n\n210\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:17.243\nSo we gotta get, we got\nretrieve_response_code and retrieve_body,\n\n211\n00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:22.508\ndoes this support the other HTTP verbs\nlike wp_remote_post, wp_remote_patch,\n\n212\n00:11:22.508 --> 00:11:27.110\ndo I have those, as well?\n&gt;&gt; No, but yes.\n\n213\n00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.680\nWe have a wp_remote_post.\n\n214\n00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.600\nAll of the other fun things,\n\n215\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.920\npatch, delete, put,\nthose don't exist in this world.\n\n216\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.700\nBut wp_remote_get and post is there.\n\n217\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.841\nAnd then there's wp_remote_head, so\nif you ever need to do one of those,\n\n218\n00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:45.050\nwhich is very unlikely, so let's scroll\ndown here to where there are other.\n\n219\n00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.430\nSo we have a remote_get, and\nthere's a couple examples there.\n\n220\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.230\nThen if we scroll down a bit more, we'll\nsee the post version which we'll do in\n\n221\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.880\njust a moment, wp_remote_post, and\nthen there's also wp_remote_head.\n\n222\n00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.250\nSo those are the three main ones.\n\n223\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.615\nNow, technically,\nyou could do this special one,\n\n224\n00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:03.370\nwp_remote_request with a method,\nso you could do other ones.\n\n225\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.640\nIt gets a little bit more complicated when\nyou're going that route, you have to do\n\n226\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.170\na little bit more of the raw parts\nyourself, but it's technically possible.\n\n227\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.690\nSo let's hop over.\n\n228\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.900\nI just wanna show you real quick\nwhat the body was returning.\n\n229\n00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.180\nSo if we went to the API ourself,\nyou'd have API, this is our body.\n\n230\n00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.970\nAnd so\nwhen we did wp_remote_retrieve_body,\n\n231\n00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.090\nit's returning the contents of the body.\n\n232\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.970\nAnd that's JSON is what it's\nreturning into our contributors.\n\n233\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.780\nAnd that's what ends up, here.\n\n234\n00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.750\nThat's the getting aspect.\n\n235\n00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.896\nNow, the posting aspect.\n\n236\n00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:39.530\nHere, we're going to copy and\npaste this little example over.\n\n237\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.900\nThen we'll explain this part, so\nWhat posting is you're sending data, too.\n\n238\n00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.860\nSo for example,\nyou're integrating with some sort of API.\n\n239\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.074\nMaybe the SendGrid API.\n\n240\n00:12:53.074 --> 00:12:54.140\nMaybe MailChimp API.\n\n241\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.040\nMaybe Twitter API.\n\n242\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.030\nThings along those lines.\n\n243\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.460\nAnd so our body is those parameters.\n\n244\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.740\nSo in this case, we're just sending to\na fake API, which is your contact form.\n\n245\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.998\nAnd we're submitting in the name,\nthe email, the subject, and the comment.\n\n246\n00:13:07.998 --> 00:13:12.554\nNow in maybe SendGrid API, maybe you would\nbe posting the email address of the two\n\n247\n00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:17.640\nemail, the subject, the email, maybe\nthe template ID, things along those lines.\n\n248\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.170\nIf you're submitting to DigitalOcean,\n\n249\n00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.210\nmaybe you have a way that you can spin\nout droplets from within your plugin.\n\n250\n00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.790\nThat, and then you would be submitting,\nthe droplet size,\n\n251\n00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.630\nthe droplet configuration,\nthings along those lines.\n\n252\n00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:33.040\nIf you're submitting to a MailChimp or\nother marketing service providers, you\n\n253\n00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.610\nmight be submitting an email address, and\nan IP address, things along those lines.\n\n254\n00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:41.450\nSo any sort of data that you're posting to\nan API, or anything along those lines, so\n\n255\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.790\nthis would be your body.\n\n256\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.560\nAnd any arguments like before we had,\n\n257\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.270\nwe looked at, there's an authorization\nobject and there's other options there.\n\n258\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:54.450\nYou can also have a body and\nyou could place these body attributes into\n\n259\n00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.200\nthe body index of the arguments\nwhen you're doing your remote post.\n\n260\n00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.810\nLet me just roll that just a hair so\nyou can see there.\n\n261\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.950\nThe wp_remote_posts are posting to our\nURL, in this case, it's a fake URL.\n\n262\n00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.728\nAnd then we're passing our arguments to\nthat, and that's how we would post back to\n\n263\n00:14:08.728 --> 00:14:14.750\nan API and submit our data in the body.\n&gt;&gt; Now along with those arguments,\n\n264\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.970\ndo I have to every time say time on five,\n\n265\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.330\nredirect your five, HTTP version 1,\nor whatever those respective values.\n\n266\n00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.268\nOr are there sensible built-in defaults,\nlike,\n\n267\n00:14:25.268 --> 00:14:29.480\nor is there a default time out, is there\na default HTTP version to where if I\n\n268\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.050\njust wanted to send the body because\nI know I just need to send that data.\n\n269\n00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.920\nCan I just leave some of\nthose arguments out or\n\n270\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.340\ndo I always need to provide those?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n271\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.410\nyou can definitely leave these out.\n\n272\n00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:45.310\nSo the default, if you just left off\ncompletely, the default is an empty array.\n\n273\n00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.110\nAnd technically,\nmost of these have defaults.\n\n274\n00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:52.223\nSo we could, theoretically, leave just the\nbody and you could even just place this\n\n275\n00:14:52.223 --> 00:14:55.620\ninto that, and not even have this\nextra variable or something.\n\n276\n00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.950\nBut it's usually best practice to\ntry to at least map these out,\n\n277\n00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.130\nthat way you don't get any\nweird inconsistencies.\n\n278\n00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.950\nBut also,\nwhen it comes to the certain APIs,\n\n279\n00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.630\na lot of these APIs will tell\nyou exactly how to be doing it.\n\n280\n00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.879\nSo in this case, a lot of these defaults,\nthe blocking, true, headers,\n\n281\n00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:12.840\narray, cookies, we'll probably use these\na lot, so you could just leave those off.\n\n282\n00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.010\nBut it really depends on the API you're\nintegrating with about what you want to\n\n283\n00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.950\nconfigure.\n&gt;&gt; Now let me, so we've seen get and post,\n\n284\n00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:20.900\nand we have method.\n\n285\n00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.630\nSo even though we don't have shortcut,\nlike get and post, or put and\n\n286\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.760\npatch and delete,\nwe still have access to those methods.\n\n287\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:34.100\nWe can accomplish all of those HTTP\nverbs if we use the wp_remote_request,\n\n288\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.120\nwith a method parameter pass through.\n\n289\n00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.980\nAm I correct in that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.690\n&gt;&gt; I was making sure I got that right.\n\n291\n00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n292\n00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.890\nSo you could do other things,\nthere's a lot of,\n\n293\n00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.010\nespecially depending on what building\nout and API's you're integrating with.\n\n294\n00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.404\nThere's usually a delete end point.\n\n295\n00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:49.450\nThere's usually something like\na put end point to update things.\n\n296\n00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.470\nSo you're gonna encounter those,\ndepending on API's and\n\n297\n00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.270\nthings you're integrating with.\n\n298\n00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.110\nSo you could use the wp_remote_request,\nand\n\n299\n00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.240\nthen as the argument, the method,\nyou would pass whatever type of\n\n300\n00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.640\nrequest you were sending over.\n&gt;&gt; Now I think we have touched this on our\n\n301\n00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.840\nprevious episode, both of these request\ntypes, these are IO kinda network bound.\n\n302\n00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.710\nIf I'm using these and\nthe page comes to that,\n\n303\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.500\nthese have to finish before\nfurther code executes by default.\n\n304\n00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.070\nI noticed there's\na blocking parameter there.\n\n305\n00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.830\nI could turn that off,\nbut then most of the time,\n\n306\n00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.155\nI need the data that I'm requesting in\norder to, actually, render out what I'm,\n\n307\n00:16:27.155 --> 00:16:31.680\nlike my page, respectively, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really depends on the context,\n\n308\n00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.050\nbut in most cases, if you're doing a page\nload, like our Twitter feed or if you're\n\n309\n00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.300\ngoing to have contributors, those are the\nkind of things you need the data on load.\n\n310\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.200\nSo that's where the concept\nof caching comes in, and\n\n311\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.260\nin our case, in most cases, you're going\nto be using the transients that we\n\n312\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.882\nlearned about in a previous episode.\n\n313\n00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:52.065\nSo set_transient, and then up\nset_transient and add transient, no,\n\n314\n00:16:52.065 --> 00:16:56.270\nset_transient and\nget_transient, you would add or\n\n315\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.770\nset your transient of whatever data, so\n\n316\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:03.730\nin our case our GitHub contributors\nif I go to the right part here.\n\n317\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.550\nOur contributors, we would store into\na transient, that way, we can say, hey,\n\n318\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.848\nonly load this once every hour or\nonce every day, depending on the context.\n\n319\n00:17:10.848 --> 00:17:13.816\nNow, obviously, in the remote post, you\ncan't really do it if you're posting data.\n\n320\n00:17:13.816 --> 00:17:16.360\nSo that just kinda depends\non your circumstances.\n\n321\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.540\nSo but the key things you always wanted\nto remember is, how can I cache this?\n\n322\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.310\nAnd then, is there any error checks\nthat I need to put across this?\n\n323\n00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.420\nNow the specific ones would really depend\non the API you're integrating with there.\n\n324\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.830\nDoes that make sense,\n\n325\n00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.070\nhow that all flows together?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n326\n00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.390\nI'm just making sure I'm mapping my common\nknowledge base, and things that I know\n\n327\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.588\nwithin this realm, and for the most part,\nthese are fairly ubiquitous concepts.\n\n328\n00:17:40.588 --> 00:17:43.840\nThere are some nuance differences.\n\n329\n00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.600\nFull disclosure,\nI probably wouldn't have looked for\n\n330\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.700\na function to retrieve the body.\n\n331\n00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.620\nI would have just been like response,\nbody, done, until something failed and\n\n332\n00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.550\nI was like, yeah,\nit's not always said, it's not always.\n\n333\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.510\nSo that's just kind of\nthese learning experiences.\n\n334\n00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.550\nNow, we've seen how to get post and\nwe know that all the other methods\n\n335\n00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.790\nare available and some of the nuances\nthat we need to consider.\n\n336\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:09.400\nAre there other things that we need to\nbe aware of when we're requesting data\n\n337\n00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.010\nfrom these remote sites or\nsending data to these remote sites?\n\n338\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.610\nThe tricky part comes in\nwhen you have authorization.\n\n339\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.970\nAuthorization gets really\nfinicky when it comes to.\n\n340\n00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:24.970\nWe saw the example of basic authorization,\nright here, but you'll encounter\n\n341\n00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.520\na lot of different APIs, especially if\nyou're sending data or updating data.\n\n342\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.880\nYou're gonna see authorizations\nsuch as Basic, there's OAuth,\n\n343\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.210\nthere's the Tokens, and WordPress,\nthis part gets a little finicky.\n\n344\n00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.640\nSo sometimes you wanna encounter something\nyou have to do a lot of testing and\n\n345\n00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.110\nGoogling, in sack overflow, trying to\nfigure this out, so that part gets tricky.\n\n346\n00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.680\nBut the rest of it, as long as\nyou're sticking to the conventions\n\n347\n00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.560\nthat we went over, you'll be able to do\nthis smooth sailing most of the time.\n\n348\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Frank, thanks so\n\n349\n00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.880\nmuch for giving us a nice\noverview of how to get and\n\n350\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.650\nsend data from our respective\nWordPress environments.\n\n351\n00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.720\nWhether it be from a settings page or\nfrom other places,\n\n352\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.110\nseems pretty straightforward so\ndefinitely take a look, play around.\n\n353\n00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.440\nWho knows make a plug-in that\nhas GitHub or something?\n\n354\n00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.060\nWho has the most poor\nrequest In the last 30 days.\n\n355\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.710\nYou can definitely do that, now that\nyou've seen, well, what Frank's shown us.\n\n356\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.950\nBut definitely stay tuned, we got more\nWordPress development coming your way.\n\n357\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.750\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n358\n00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.880\nSo signing out for DevPro.TV,\n\n359\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.800\nI've been been your host Justin Denison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Frank Corso.\n\n360\n00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.200\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n361\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:33.021\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another\nexciting episode of DevProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.782\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and well,\n\n5\n00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:21.710\nwe're back with more\nWordPress development.\n\n6\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.264\nAnd in particular we're going to\nbe looking a little more at users.\n\n7\n00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:28.324\nAnd that kind of makes sense\nstarting in our blog origin,\n\n8\n00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:31.211\nusers kind of seem to be a staple of that.\n\n9\n00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:34.410\nAnd well, that's the extent\nthat I know about the subject.\n\n10\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.458\nSo luckily we have someone in\nthe studio who knows all about that.\n\n11\n00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:38.440\nMr. Frank Corso.\n\n12\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.990\nHow you doing today, Frank?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.865\nHow are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Frank.\n\n14\n00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:47.220\nNow, because I don't know a great deal,\nlet's see here.\n\n15\n00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.220\nUsers, really what do we need to know to\nget started in kind of our furthering\n\n16\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.680\nour WordPress development knowledge?\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes to users,\n\n17\n00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.740\nwe have to remember that this\nstarted off as a blogging software.\n\n18\n00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.040\nAnd so there's these old rules and\ncapabilities that kind of sound a little\n\n19\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.060\nweird in today's world, but it made sense\nback when it was blogging software.\n\n20\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.050\nAnd we touched on roles and capabilities\na little bit in a previous episode, but\n\n21\n00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.780\nnow in this episode we're\nactually gonna create a user and\n\n22\n00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.250\nthen do some things to check to\nmake sure we're creating a user and\n\n23\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.080\ngiving them capabilities and\nthings along those lines.\n\n24\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.480\nSo we need a better understanding\nof what roles and capabilities are.\n\n25\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.960\nSo first, the roles are usually\nnot used too much anymore today.\n\n26\n00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.811\nBut you'll see this every now and then.\n\n27\n00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:33.394\nYou'll see the role on what, when you\ncreate a new user in WordPress for\n\n28\n00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:35.822\nthe first time, it'll say,\ntheir role as subscriber or author.\n\n29\n00:01:35.822 --> 00:01:37.853\nThose roles don't actually\nmean anything today.\n\n30\n00:01:37.853 --> 00:01:42.640\nThey're just used because it's been around\nfor so long and they've already existed.\n\n31\n00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.850\nWe just have never taken them out.\n\n32\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.269\nSo you might come across things,\nadmin, administrator, editor, author,\n\n33\n00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:52.407\ncontributor, subscriber,\nthings along those lines.\n\n34\n00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:56.329\nBut in reality, each of those roles are\nattached to something called capabilities.\n\n35\n00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.746\nAnd these capabilities is\nthe permission set and\n\n36\n00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:04.940\nthen rules around permissions for users.\n\n37\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.610\nSo in this case, and by default you\nhave a role such as administrator.\n\n38\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.790\nAnd that administrator,\nthat role doesn't actually mean anything.\n\n39\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.780\nWhat really means something is all these\ncapabilities that are attached to that\n\n40\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.650\nadministrator user.\n\n41\n00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:20.640\nSo what WordPress does, it has these\ndefault roles and default permissions or\n\n42\n00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.830\ncapabilities that are attached\nto that default role.\n\n43\n00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.700\nSo when you create a user\nunderneath that role,\n\n44\n00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.302\nit assigns these capabilities to them.\n\n45\n00:02:26.302 --> 00:02:30.008\nBut in reality, all it's doing is just\ngiving you these capabilities and\n\n46\n00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:33.740\nthat word role is just helping you\ngroup certain capabilities together.\n\n47\n00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.530\nBut as you start building out\nyour own users, or your own\n\n48\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.380\ndifferent user types within your software,\nyou might not need those default roles.\n\n49\n00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.902\nWhat you need is the capabilities,\n\n50\n00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:46.193\nand then that role doesn't\nactually mean anything.\n\n51\n00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:48.878\nYou could say, hey,\nwe're gonna create a role of IT person.\n\n52\n00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:50.869\nAnd that's just arbitrary.\n\n53\n00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:55.331\nIt's the capabilities that you'll define\nthat matters about the permission levels.\n\n54\n00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:59.042\nSo let's jump to the laptop screen, and\nwe'll go, we've seen this page a few times\n\n55\n00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:02.675\nduring our different development, and\nthis is our Roles and Capabilities page.\n\n56\n00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:07.227\nAnd in this case, we just went over the\ndifferent default types, administrator,\n\n57\n00:03:07.227 --> 00:03:10.480\neditor, author, contributor,\nand subscriber.\n\n58\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.700\nNow there is one called super admin,\nthat has to do with multi site and\n\n59\n00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.700\nsite networks.\n\n60\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.357\nWe haven't touched on that yet so\nit's a bit beyond the scope of this and\n\n61\n00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:19.927\nwe'll get back to that one, but for\nright now we're just gonna focus\n\n62\n00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:22.781\non the core five of admin, editor,\nauthor, contributor and subscriber.\n\n63\n00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:27.253\nNow like I said, all these\nare attached to actually capabilities.\n\n64\n00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:31.543\nSo like the administrator, when you\ncreate a new administrator, by default,\n\n65\n00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:33.870\nthey have this list of capabilities.\n\n66\n00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.830\nSo everything from deleting the entire\nsite to publishing posts, to exporting\n\n67\n00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.300\ncontent, to deleting private pages,\nto activating plugins, etc, etc.\n\n68\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.630\nThese are all default capabilities that\nare attached to a default administrator.\n\n69\n00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.903\nSo when we go to create our own user,\nthe role isn't what's super important.\n\n70\n00:03:52.903 --> 00:03:55.775\nIt's the capability that would\ndefine what they can do.\n\n71\n00:03:55.775 --> 00:04:00.612\nSo let's hop in and\nwhat we're gonna do is create our user.\n\n72\n00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:04.210\nSo there's a function\ncalled wp create user.\n\n73\n00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.736\nSo we can hop over into our plug-in\nthat we've been working on.\n\n74\n00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:11.209\nI've removed some of the other\ncontent that was in there so\n\n75\n00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.180\nwe can get this a little cleaner.\n\n76\n00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.170\nAnd we could go,\nlet's hop over to the function here.\n\n77\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.750\nOur usage, we have our username,\nand password, and email.\n\n78\n00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.450\nSo we could do wp_create_user(\n'my_username', and we have 'password'.\n\n79\n00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.720\nAnd we'll say my password is\npassword cuz that is super secure.\n\n80\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.225\nAnd we'll say my email\nis test@example.com.\n\n81\n00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:39.931\nAnd we could do this\nsomewhere in our code, and\n\n82\n00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:43.360\nthen what that would\ndo is create our user.\n\n83\n00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.980\nAnd we could say, so we have our username,\nwe have our password, we have our email,\n\n84\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.420\nand that's great.\n\n85\n00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.410\nWell the issue is,\nis what if that email already exists?\n\n86\n00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.320\nWhat if that username already exists?\n\n87\n00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.320\nWe probably want a more secure password.\n\n88\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.930\nSo there's all these helper functions that\ngo around this step of creating the user.\n\n89\n00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.370\nThe very first one is username_exists.\n\n90\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.120\nAnd I'm sure you could probably\nfigure out what this one does,\n\n91\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.756\nessentially it takes a string of username\nand returns back either the user ID or\n\n92\n00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:15.510\nfalse if there's no user name.\n\n93\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.973\nSo what we could do is come up here and\nwe could say $user_id\n\n94\n00:05:20.973 --> 00:05:26.350\n= username_exists and\nwe could say my_username here.\n\n95\n00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.922\nAnd what we could do is we could\ndo something like this, so\n\n96\n00:05:32.922 --> 00:05:38.990\nif it's truthy, we could then\nput the wp_create inside that.\n\n97\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.549\nLet's give us a little\nbit more space there.\n\n98\n00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:48.820\nAnd now, that will only create the user\nif the user_id variable is, I'm sorry.\n\n99\n00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.322\nNo, did that backwards.\n\n100\n00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:52.700\nIs not truthy.\n\n101\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.470\nSo if it comes back as false,\nthen we go, we need to create the user.\n\n102\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.001\nAnd if it's not false, then we could do\nsomething here like if we're editing,\n\n103\n00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:01.860\nmaybe I should put an else in there,\nthat'd probably be smart.\n\n104\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.490\nIf we're editing the user or\n\n105\n00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.650\nsomething, we can do that there\nbecause the user already exists.\n\n106\n00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.410\nOr we can say, it doesn't exist, let's\ngo ahead and run our create functions.\n\n107\n00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.838\nBut then the next thing that we want\nto check is probably the email.\n\n108\n00:06:13.838 --> 00:06:15.529\nMaybe that username doesn't exist but\n\n109\n00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:18.100\nmaybe that email is already\nattached to another username.\n\n110\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.200\nSo that's where this next helper function,\nemail_exists, come in.\n\n111\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.120\nAnd I'm pretty sure you can guess that\nthis works almost the exact same way.\n\n112\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.160\nAnd yes, it will return user ID\non success and false on failure.\n\n113\n00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.150\nSo we can come in here and\nwe can do this one or two ways.\n\n114\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.080\nWe can do this up above or\nwe can do it within, whichever is easiest.\n\n115\n00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.120\nWe'll just do $email = email_exists,\n\n116\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.603\nand we'll say test@example.com.\n\n117\n00:06:47.603 --> 00:06:53.620\nAnd if this comes back false, and\nif I could spell, there we go,\n\n118\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.770\nthen we know that we can put\nour create_user in there.\n\n119\n00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.310\nNow we could've done that above and\nthen done both checks at once.\n\n120\n00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.460\nSo let me drop that in and\nthen I'll explain that.\n\n121\n00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.610\nSo we could move email_exists,\nthis whole line up above the first if,\n\n122\n00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.360\nand then check hey, if this is but\nthen we're doing two calls.\n\n123\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.672\nAnd if the username doesn't exist or\ndoes exist,\n\n124\n00:07:17.672 --> 00:07:20.597\nthen we could skip that extra call\nif we could, if we needed to.\n\n125\n00:07:20.597 --> 00:07:23.345\nNow, on our site we're\nthe only user right now, and\n\n126\n00:07:23.345 --> 00:07:26.346\nwe're the only traffic,\nspeed, it probably wouldn't\n\n127\n00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:30.050\nmake a difference if we did both of\nthese calls even we didn't need to.\n\n128\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.749\nBut if you have 10,000 users, and there's\na lot of different things going on,\n\n129\n00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:37.229\nand this is a script\nthat happens regularly,\n\n130\n00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:39.858\nthan that extra check\ncould hurt performance.\n\n131\n00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:41.042\nSo I just brought it in,\n\n132\n00:07:41.042 --> 00:07:43.840\nyou can do it either way\ndepending on what your scope is.\n\n133\n00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.446\nSo now we're checking if the username\nexists, we're checking if the email\n\n134\n00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:53.664\nexists and now we probably want something\na little better password than that.\n\n135\n00:07:53.664 --> 00:07:57.913\nI'm sure everyone out there has a password\nthat's just password cuz that's super\n\n136\n00:07:57.913 --> 00:08:02.413\nsecure, but maybe we don't want that, and\nluckily WordPress Has a function for that.\n\n137\n00:08:02.413 --> 00:08:05.348\nNow I'm sure you're getting used\nto WordPress having functions for\n\n138\n00:08:05.348 --> 00:08:08.650\nus for everything,\nthat's the beauty of working in WordPress.\n\n139\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.430\nAnd, like always, they have this wonderful\nfunction called wp generate password.\n\n140\n00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.310\nAnd what this does is,\nit generates a random password\n\n141\n00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.850\nbrought from just defined characters\nthat they have within this function.\n\n142\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.860\nNow you could have a length,\nit defaults to 12.\n\n143\n00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.880\nMe, personally, all of my passwords are 20\ncharacters, so I usually pass 20 here.\n\n144\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.880\nBut it really depends on your site,\nand what your preference is.\n\n145\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.960\nNow the special characters and extra\nspecial characters, you can set these to\n\n146\n00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.720\ntrue and false, or true and true,\nto include extra characters.\n\n147\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.560\nSo by default it's 12 and true,\nso do they give an example?\n\n148\n00:08:45.402 --> 00:08:49.279\nSo these are the characters that\nthey would include, looking for,\n\n149\n00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:52.170\ndo they give an example password output?\n\n150\n00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:57.732\nNo, But you can imagine it would be 12\ncharacters pulled from that random string,\n\n151\n00:08:57.732 --> 00:09:01.619\nwhich is quite a lot of different lower\ncase, upper case, and special characters.\n\n152\n00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:04.582\nAnd that could include extra special\ncharacters if we set that other value\n\n153\n00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:07.974\nto true, but that would really depend on\nwhat your database structure's like, and\n\n154\n00:09:07.974 --> 00:09:09.394\nwhat is your code structure like.\n\n155\n00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:11.400\nSo that would be something to play with.\n\n156\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.057\nBut for us, we're gonna come down here,\n\n157\n00:09:15.057 --> 00:09:19.978\nand we're gonna say pass\n= wp_generate_password.\n\n158\n00:09:19.978 --> 00:09:22.762\nAnd we're just gonna change\nthe first value to 20, and\n\n159\n00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:26.300\nwe're gonna use the defaults for\neverything else, cuz that's true and\n\n160\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.052\nfalse, that should be beautiful.\n\n161\n00:09:28.052 --> 00:09:28.755\nCome up here.\n\n162\n00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:33.200\nAnd we're gonna drop this event.\n\n163\n00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.475\nAnd now, technically, we are creating\nour user, we check the username,\n\n164\n00:09:37.475 --> 00:09:40.688\nwe check the email, and we generate\na passwords that's 20 characters long.\n\n165\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.743\nSo at this point, we would have a user.\n\n166\n00:09:46.743 --> 00:09:51.170\nNow let's see, am I doing,\nI'm just doing this on page load, so\n\n167\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.355\nlet me just do this once and see.\n\n168\n00:09:53.355 --> 00:09:55.305\nIt should work if we just relayed, oop.\n\n169\n00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.651\nWe'll get user by,\ncuz I'm in something weird here.\n\n170\n00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:05.441\nLet me try to, hm, hm hm hm.\n\n171\n00:10:05.441 --> 00:10:08.796\nAll right,\nwe'll hop back into that in just a moment.\n\n172\n00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:10.500\nI have a stack trace error.\n\n173\n00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.714\nProbably, [LAUGH] because we're doing this\nin the plugins of loaded's hook right now,\n\n174\n00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:16.217\ncuz I have it just in the plug in.\n\n175\n00:10:16.217 --> 00:10:18.700\nI don't actually have this\nhooking in somewhere.\n\n176\n00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.480\nSo we're trying to create a user\nbefore the users are even loaded,\n\n177\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.930\nthat's probably not a good idea.\n\n178\n00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:29.224\nSo why don't we, Let me comment this out,\nand put this somewhere.\n\n179\n00:10:29.224 --> 00:10:30.660\nThat makes a little bit more sense.\n\n180\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.486\nSo do we still have,\nI deleted our settings page.\n\n181\n00:10:35.486 --> 00:10:40.488\nSo we'll get back to that, but for\nnow, let's go to our next part here,\n\n182\n00:10:40.488 --> 00:10:45.173\nwhich is, might delete some of these\nextra tabs so we can find them.\n\n183\n00:10:45.173 --> 00:10:52.008\nGenerate password, [INAUDIBLE] username,\nSo that's remove, where's add?\n\n184\n00:10:52.008 --> 00:10:54.820\nSo once we have our user created, which\nwe'll get back to that in just a moment.\n\n185\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.370\nThis is how you can add\na capability to that user, or\n\n186\n00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.960\nin this case, adds a capability\nto a role or a specific user.\n\n187\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:13.714\nSo if we scroll down to the parameters,\nYou're gonna pass a role to this,\n\n188\n00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:17.800\nand then pass a capability, and then you\ncan add that capability to this role.\n\n189\n00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.534\nSo hypothetically, if you needed to give\nan extra permission to all subscribers, or\n\n190\n00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:26.609\nmaybe you have a new role that you've\ncreated, that maybe the IT role, or\n\n191\n00:11:26.609 --> 00:11:27.686\nsomething along.\n\n192\n00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:31.272\nAnd you wanna add the predefined\ncapabilities to that role,\n\n193\n00:11:31.272 --> 00:11:33.600\nwe could use this function to add that.\n\n194\n00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.140\nSo let's scroll down just a second, so\nyou can see in this case, we're using\n\n195\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.250\nthis as an object, as the wp_role class,\nand we can get_role( 'author' ).\n\n196\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:50.940\nAnd we can add a capability of\nedit_others_posts to that role.\n\n197\n00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.273\nSo in this case we are saying,\nhey, all authors can now\n\n198\n00:11:54.273 --> 00:11:58.714\nedit everyone else’s posts,\nwhich is what this capability here does.\n\n199\n00:11:58.714 --> 00:12:02.280\nNow we could do the same thing\nwith our own defined roles.\n\n200\n00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.320\nSo if we were creating roles,\nwhich we’ll get to, and\n\n201\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.750\nwe could create our IT role, or\nmaybe you have a shop owner role,\n\n202\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.680\nthings along those lines, you can use this\nadd cap to add abilities to those roles.\n\n203\n00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.780\nNow let's see, do they have\nanother example of, here we go.\n\n204\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.675\nSo we could also use this\nadd capability for our user,\n\n205\n00:12:25.675 --> 00:12:30.558\nso before, let's see,\nwhere was, here we go.\n\n206\n00:12:30.558 --> 00:12:34.570\nSo before, we had our create user,\nour wp_create_user,\n\n207\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.647\nand this returns a user\nID of the created user.\n\n208\n00:12:37.647 --> 00:12:43.720\nSo what we could do is, if I bring that\nback in, so, and set this to a user ID.\n\n209\n00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.420\nWe could then, let's see,\nwhere was our function?\n\n210\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.910\nThere it is, add_cap.\n\n211\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:56.239\nWe could use this new\nthing called new WP_User.\n\n212\n00:12:56.239 --> 00:13:01.241\nAnd what a WP_User is, is in WordPress,\nthey have a class of WP_User.\n\n213\n00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:04.495\nAnd this is a lot of different\nfunctions built into this class for\n\n214\n00:13:04.495 --> 00:13:05.930\nmanipulating users.\n\n215\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.079\nAnd what it takes to construct\nthis is the user_id, so\n\n216\n00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:12.301\nin this case we create our user,\nit gives us a user_id.\n\n217\n00:13:12.301 --> 00:13:15.512\nIn most cases,\nwe'll do error checking in just a moment,\n\n218\n00:13:15.512 --> 00:13:18.208\nwe create our user using\nthis class of WP_User.\n\n219\n00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:22.078\nWe initiate a new user,\nour new user instance, and\n\n220\n00:13:22.078 --> 00:13:28.340\nthen we can call this function add_cap\non this user, to can_edit_posts.\n\n221\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.809\nHowever in this case, this would only\nhappen when we created the user, which\n\n222\n00:13:32.809 --> 00:13:37.719\nwouldn't make sense, cuz then they would\nonly have that permission that one time.\n\n223\n00:13:39.727 --> 00:13:43.590\nSo as we scroll back up, we'll see that\nthey added this to the admin_init.\n\n224\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.513\nSo the better practice would be\nto give this user a role, and\n\n225\n00:13:47.513 --> 00:13:51.730\nthen give these roles\ncapabilities in the admin_init.\n\n226\n00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.514\nAnd that way,\nevery time the page loads it goes, hey,\n\n227\n00:13:55.514 --> 00:13:58.412\nthese are the permissions for that role.\n\n228\n00:13:58.412 --> 00:14:00.389\nDoes that sort of make sense?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that and,\n\n229\n00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:02.980\nI was almost getting ready\nto jump ahead of you.\n\n230\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.510\nI was like so, for an individual user,\n\n231\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:11.060\ncould we create a role that is just\nthe username, and then assign?\n\n232\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.510\nI know that's kinda hackish,\nand maybe we shouldn't.\n\n233\n00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.990\nYou shouldn't actually do this.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.080\n&gt;&gt; But can we, is the question?\n\n235\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.160\nSo let's say my username is Justin.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n236\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.350\n&gt;&gt; Can I create a role called Justin, and\n\n237\n00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.360\nassign the Justin user to Justin role?\n\n238\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.649\nAnd then have the Justin role have\nall the permissions that I need?\n\n239\n00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:31.220\nAnd use-\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n240\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:31.856\n&gt;&gt; Can I do that,\n\n241\n00:14:31.856 --> 00:14:35.040\n[LAUGH] not should I do that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we weren't gonna quite get to\n\n242\n00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.710\nthe admin role part yet, but\nwe'll go ahead and we'll scroll down here.\n\n243\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.450\nSo the function to add a role\njust takes a role name and\n\n244\n00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.660\nthe display name for the role.\n\n245\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.837\nSo you could theoretically say, hey,\nwe're gonna create a new role of Justin,\n\n246\n00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:52.279\nand then we could pass an array\nof capabilities to it.\n\n247\n00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:56.750\nNow you probably shouldn't, you probably\nshould have a defined role there.\n\n248\n00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.550\nBecause you never know, in the future,\nif you're building this for yourself or\n\n249\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.990\na client, maybe they only have one Justin.\n\n250\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.580\nBut maybe in the future,\nthey're gonna have an extra Justin, or\n\n251\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.160\nmaybe not a Justin, but an extra person\nthat does the same thing Justin's doing.\n\n252\n00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.510\nBut then your code wouldn't allow for\nthat, so then you'd have to rewrite it all\n\n253\n00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.400\nto create it into a role,\na real role, not just a Justin role.\n\n254\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:21.410\nSo it's better practice to create a role,\nand that Justin can go into,\n\n255\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.270\nand then maybe in the future other\npeople can go into that role.\n\n256\n00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.834\n&gt;&gt; And that makes sense,\n\n257\n00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:30.207\nI was kind of playing Devil's Advocate\nthere for a little bit.\n\n258\n00:15:30.207 --> 00:15:33.665\nI've seen systems where,\nnot only do you have a username, but\n\n259\n00:15:33.665 --> 00:15:36.273\nyou have an associated,\nlike a group or a role or\n\n260\n00:15:36.273 --> 00:15:39.690\na set of policies that are linked\nto your username initially.\n\n261\n00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.890\nThat might not be the only group or\nrole that you belong to.\n\n262\n00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.970\nBut it's kind of a way of managing\npermissions based on this grouping.\n\n263\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.230\nBut I agree, if you and\nI both had accounts, there was a Frank and\n\n264\n00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.360\na Justin, but we did the same job, but\n\n265\n00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.010\nwe were both under the Justin role,\nthat could become kind of a nightmare.\n\n266\n00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.173\nAs far as maintenance or\n[LAUGH] actually readability, or\n\n267\n00:16:01.173 --> 00:16:06.129\nreasoning about So as I said before,\nI'm just asking if you could.\n\n268\n00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:10.509\nYou probably shouldn't, though,\njust to keep things kind of clear, right.\n\n269\n00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:11.073\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n270\n00:16:11.073 --> 00:16:13.090\nthen we have an example\non the screen over here.\n\n271\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.433\nHow you could do that if you're creating\na new role, would be something like this,\n\n272\n00:16:17.433 --> 00:16:19.619\nwhere you add role, the slug of the role.\n\n273\n00:16:19.619 --> 00:16:22.890\nYou can think of the role name\nas the slug of the role, so\n\n274\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:27.464\nit's basic_contributor, and\nthen this display is what gets displayed.\n\n275\n00:16:27.464 --> 00:16:31.990\nSo if we hop back over to our users,\nso we come up to all users.\n\n276\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.850\nWe have Frank here, and\n\n277\n00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.090\nhe's an administrator, so\nthis display is what would show up there.\n\n278\n00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.686\nSo let me hop back over\nto that example I had.\n\n279\n00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:41.786\nBasic contributor, that would show\nup where it says administrator, and\n\n280\n00:16:41.786 --> 00:16:43.190\nanywhere else that it would say.\n\n281\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.580\nSo that's what that second perameter does.\n\n282\n00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.496\nThe third perimeter is\nan array of capabilities.\n\n283\n00:16:47.496 --> 00:16:52.232\nIn this particular function,\nit's better to add this role once,\n\n284\n00:16:52.232 --> 00:16:56.210\ncuz this actually gets\nsaved into the database.\n\n285\n00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.830\nSo I think they have the giant\nwarning at the top here to not do it\n\n286\n00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.620\nevery time, right?\n\n287\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.477\nYeah, see the giant warning, so this is\nsaved into the database as a new role,\n\n288\n00:17:03.477 --> 00:17:04.188\nas an option.\n\n289\n00:17:04.188 --> 00:17:06.106\nSome technicalities there,\nbut essentially,\n\n290\n00:17:06.106 --> 00:17:07.798\nthis is something you only wanna run once.\n\n291\n00:17:07.798 --> 00:17:11.250\nSo there's something called\na theme plugin activation script.\n\n292\n00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.340\nAnd that is beyond the scope\nof what we're gonna do today.\n\n293\n00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:18.850\nBut essentially, you can have it when you\nactivate a plugin, this function will get\n\n294\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.720\ncalled, and it'll get called only\nwhen you activate that plugin.\n\n295\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.456\nSo that's how you would handle the role\nquestion rabbit hole we just went down.\n\n296\n00:17:25.456 --> 00:17:28.711\nDoes that sort of make sense?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that makes sense, and\n\n297\n00:17:28.711 --> 00:17:31.441\nI was wondering about\nthat because I was like,\n\n298\n00:17:31.441 --> 00:17:36.600\nI don't know if we would wanna do this\nevery time, if it is doing database stuff.\n\n299\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.130\nBut we haven't quite got there,\nbut that does make sense.\n\n300\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:45.063\nYou wanna run that one time because\nyou're modifying some kind of stateful\n\n301\n00:17:45.063 --> 00:17:49.305\nchunk of data that you don't\nnecessarily need to do every time.\n\n302\n00:17:49.305 --> 00:17:52.803\nSo I kinda took you off on a rail there,\nFrank, what else do we need to know about\n\n303\n00:17:52.803 --> 00:17:56.020\nusers, so to speak?\n&gt;&gt; So right now in the code up here,\n\n304\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.210\nwe have an example of,\n\n305\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.070\nmaybe you had somewhere where\nyou needed to create a user.\n\n306\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.710\nNow, this could be a lot of times,\nright now, in the actual WordPress,\n\n307\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.368\nyou could come here, and you could go\nAdd New, you can create a new user.\n\n308\n00:18:07.368 --> 00:18:10.320\nSo in a lot of cases, you might not\nneed to write this kind of thing.\n\n309\n00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.920\nSo this would be more for,\nmaybe you have some sort of script.\n\n310\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.290\nMaybe you have an e-commerce store,\nand when they go to check out,\n\n311\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.799\nyou use the email address to\nautomatically create them a user account.\n\n312\n00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:20.744\nOr maybe you have some\nsort of other script, or\n\n313\n00:18:20.744 --> 00:18:26.260\nmaybe you have a SaaS app that has users,\nand you're not using the user dashboard.\n\n314\n00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.870\nThat's where this kind\nof script would come in.\n\n315\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.109\nSo this particular part would end up\ngoing wherever you need it to go,\n\n316\n00:18:32.109 --> 00:18:34.095\nto whenever that needs to call.\n\n317\n00:18:34.095 --> 00:18:37.540\nAnd then that other part that we just had,\nI'm gonna bring that down here.\n\n318\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.370\nThis add capability,\nthis would be called at some point\n\n319\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.670\nonce the page is loaded,\nafter plugins are loaded, etc, etc.\n\n320\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.166\nNow what you could do on\nthe opposite side, so\n\n321\n00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:51.673\nthis would be adding\na specific capability.\n\n322\n00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:58.250\nYou can also remove a specific capability,\nso there's a remove capability.\n\n323\n00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.719\nAnd this, you can remove from a role or\na specific user.\n\n324\n00:19:01.719 --> 00:19:06.161\nSo maybe, it's very rare you're\ngonna remove it from an entire role.\n\n325\n00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:09.143\nMaybe you are using authors\nin a certain way, and\n\n326\n00:19:09.143 --> 00:19:11.708\nyou don't want authors to do something.\n\n327\n00:19:11.708 --> 00:19:16.020\nSo maybe you would remove\nthat capability from authors.\n\n328\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:21.326\nBut in most of the cases I've done,\nit's usually more for a user.\n\n329\n00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:25.717\nSo if we scroll down to their example,\nthey don't have an example of user, okay.\n\n330\n00:19:25.717 --> 00:19:27.773\nIt's pretty much the same way,\nexcept opposite.\n\n331\n00:19:27.773 --> 00:19:30.814\nSo if we do this, let me scroll down and\n\n332\n00:19:30.814 --> 00:19:36.814\npretend we're doing this somewhere else,\nbring that up so you can see it.\n\n333\n00:19:36.814 --> 00:19:42.990\nIt would be remove_cap like this, so\nthis would allow us to remove a capability\n\n334\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:49.087\nof can_edit_posts from our user,\nwith whatever user ID we're passing it.\n\n335\n00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:56.030\nSo if this was user 1, we would say\nthat user can no longer edit posts.\n\n336\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.962\nSo you can do this with the user or\nthe role, like they have up here,\n\n337\n00:19:59.962 --> 00:20:02.060\nI had an example, right?\n\n338\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.616\nNope, down the other way, I'm sorry,\nI'm going all over the place here.\n\n339\n00:20:06.616 --> 00:20:10.534\nSo you could remove it from the author,\nlike they have here, or you can remove it\n\n340\n00:20:10.534 --> 00:20:13.364\nfrom the user like we're doing here.\n&gt;&gt; Now Frank,\n\n341\n00:20:13.364 --> 00:20:15.920\nI do have a question about that.\n\n342\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.120\nThere's always multiple ways\nto accomplish the same thing.\n\n343\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.668\nBut if I'm taking an existing role and\nremoving capabilities,\n\n344\n00:20:22.668 --> 00:20:27.069\nwould that be preferred over creating a\nnew role that has this specific subset of\n\n345\n00:20:27.069 --> 00:20:30.826\ncapabilities, and then reassigning\nindividual users that role?\n\n346\n00:20:30.826 --> 00:20:33.716\nOr am I misunderstanding\nthis whole hierarchy?\n\n347\n00:20:33.716 --> 00:20:35.820\nI just wanna make sure I\ngot it all in my mind.\n\n348\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.326\n&gt;&gt; It really depends on how you're\n\n349\n00:20:37.326 --> 00:20:40.408\nstructuring your website and\nyour database and all that things.\n\n350\n00:20:40.408 --> 00:20:46.570\nBecause you could assign\na capability to a role or a user.\n\n351\n00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.910\nSo it really depends, and most times,\nyou're gonna be doing it to a role.\n\n352\n00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.876\nBecause that's just the standard, that\nthe role capabilities, you have different\n\n353\n00:20:53.876 --> 00:20:57.860\nusers with different roles, and then\nyou create new roles with other users.\n\n354\n00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.173\nSo it's very unlikely you're just going\nto randomly throw out capabilities\n\n355\n00:21:02.173 --> 00:21:03.320\nto a specific user.\n\n356\n00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:09.465\nMaybe you have sort some of page that\nyou only want a certain user can get to.\n\n357\n00:21:09.465 --> 00:21:13.965\nOr maybe you have some sort of SaaS\napp going, and there's different\n\n358\n00:21:13.965 --> 00:21:19.260\ncapabilities within that app, but the end\nuser can change those capabilities.\n\n359\n00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.600\nMaybe they wanna give a permission to,\nsomeone, hey,\n\n360\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.090\nI want this person to be\nable to view the order.\n\n361\n00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.950\nBut I want this person who\ncannot view the order.\n\n362\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.570\nBut at the current moment,\nthey're all in the same role.\n\n363\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.550\nAnd you're giving that owner of that\naccount the capability of changing those\n\n364\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.320\npermissions.\n\n365\n00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.419\nSo maybe that's where\nyou would do the add or\n\n366\n00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:34.861\nremove to a specific user.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n367\n00:21:34.861 --> 00:21:39.178\nI ask that because I can see having like,\nhere's your minimal set of permissions,\n\n368\n00:21:39.178 --> 00:21:42.340\nbut for this one edge case,\nI'm gonna add a new capability.\n\n369\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.200\nLike if I have an author, and for\none particular user I need to remove,\n\n370\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.605\nnow, if it's just for\none, just remove the one.\n\n371\n00:21:52.605 --> 00:21:57.990\nBut if you see that you're constantly\nremoving that capability from a bunch\n\n372\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:04.400\nof people who are authors, and then\nleaving, can_edit_posts, for instance.\n\n373\n00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.270\nYou have one author that can edit posts,\nbut\n\n374\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.230\nthen you remove that from every\nother person that's an author.\n\n375\n00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:14.259\nThat would be a use case of saying,\nwell, I have an author role, but\n\n376\n00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:18.457\nI may need to create another role\nthat has the subset of capabilities.\n\n377\n00:22:18.457 --> 00:22:20.690\nAm I right in that assertion,\nwould that be a more accurate trade?\n\n378\n00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:21.707\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in that case,\n\n379\n00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:24.868\nif you end up doing this remove cap or\nadd cap to more than one user for\n\n380\n00:22:24.868 --> 00:22:28.258\nthe same capability, and\nthey're already pretty much the same role,\n\n381\n00:22:28.258 --> 00:22:31.150\nthen that's where you would\nwant to create a new role.\n\n382\n00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.990\nSo in that case, maybe for\nwhatever reason,\n\n383\n00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.560\nif you're removing the can edit posts.\n\n384\n00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.319\nMaybe you create an extra role of new\nauthor, or something along those lines.\n\n385\n00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:40.888\nMaybe you only want the new authors,\n\n386\n00:22:40.888 --> 00:22:44.370\nthey can't edit posts until they prove\nthemselves or something like that.\n\n387\n00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.928\nSo then you would create a new role and\n\n388\n00:22:45.928 --> 00:22:49.459\nthen assign the same capabilities of\nthe author minus whatever you're removing.\n\n389\n00:22:49.459 --> 00:22:53.760\nThat's usually enough, technically,\nyou could do this either way.\n\n390\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.341\nBut to reduce your amount of headaches you\nmight have in the future when you try to\n\n391\n00:22:57.341 --> 00:23:00.282\ndebug your code, it'd probably be\nbetter to create that role and\n\n392\n00:23:00.282 --> 00:23:01.895\nassign capabilities to that role.\n\n393\n00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:08.900\nNow, once we get things going, we have\nour remove cat, I have that open twice.\n\n394\n00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.215\nWe did our create user,\nthere's this awesome hook.\n\n395\n00:23:16.237 --> 00:23:19.392\nThat adds things to the user field.\n\n396\n00:23:19.392 --> 00:23:24.308\nSo if we come over here, we go to,\nI guess I didn't comment this back out.\n\n397\n00:23:24.308 --> 00:23:25.605\nLet me comment that back out real quick.\n\n398\n00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.011\nNow say we have a plugin or theme or\nmaybe just a general script for\n\n399\n00:23:36.011 --> 00:23:38.464\na specific site you're working on.\n\n400\n00:23:38.464 --> 00:23:41.690\nAnd you need to add an extra\nfield to the user profile.\n\n401\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.911\nMaybe you wanna get their location,\nmaybe you wanna get their Twitter handle,\n\n402\n00:23:45.911 --> 00:23:48.498\nmaybe you wanna get\nanything along those lines.\n\n403\n00:23:48.498 --> 00:23:51.968\nThis specific hook,\n\n404\n00:23:51.968 --> 00:23:56.870\ntoo far down, of edit user profile.\n\n405\n00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:02.605\nThis allows you to add custom\nfields to the user profile.\n\n406\n00:24:02.605 --> 00:24:05.243\nSo there's two different ones here,\nwe have the show user profile and\n\n407\n00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:06.010\nedit user profile.\n\n408\n00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.566\nOne of these is when you're being shown,\none of these are being edited.\n\n409\n00:24:10.566 --> 00:24:12.960\nBut usually in most cases\nyou're gonna use both.\n\n410\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.090\nSo let me just copy and\n\n411\n00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.961\npaste this in real quick just so\nyou can see how this plays out.\n\n412\n00:24:16.961 --> 00:24:18.065\nAnd then we'll go through this.\n\n413\n00:24:24.617 --> 00:24:25.600\nLet's go back up here.\n\n414\n00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.070\nLet me give it some space so\nwe can see what we're doing.\n\n415\n00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:35.820\nOkay, so what we're doing is we've\ntalked about hooks and filters before.\n\n416\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.418\nBut there's different set\nof hooks within WordPress.\n\n417\n00:24:37.418 --> 00:24:41.460\nAnd as WordPress loads,\nit fires offs different hooks.\n\n418\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.500\nThese show end user_profile hooks.\n\n419\n00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.870\nThese are fired at the very bottom.\n\n420\n00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.668\nLet me scroll down just so we can see\nour location fill that I just added.\n\n421\n00:24:51.668 --> 00:24:56.490\nSo these hooks gets fired\ntowards the end of the profile.\n\n422\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.315\nSo it's going through and\nit hasn't reached the update or\n\n423\n00:24:58.315 --> 00:24:59.219\nthe closing of the form yet.\n\n424\n00:24:59.219 --> 00:25:02.178\nAnd it goes, hey, is there any\nother fields you wanna add here?\n\n425\n00:25:02.178 --> 00:25:06.760\nAnd that's what the edit user and\nshow user profile hook is doing.\n\n426\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.495\nSo we're saying yes,\nwe have some custom user profile fields.\n\n427\n00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:13.110\nThen if we come up here,\n\n428\n00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.870\nyou can see all we're putting\nhere is a label for our location.\n\n429\n00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.075\nAnd we're adding in an input\nour user location and\n\n430\n00:25:21.075 --> 00:25:25.052\nthen our value, which we'll get\nto meta in the next episode.\n\n431\n00:25:25.052 --> 00:25:28.550\nAnd then we're just having\na little bit of description.\n\n432\n00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.559\nSo that's all we're putting in,\nis a label,\n\n433\n00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:32.524\nand then an input and\nthen some description.\n\n434\n00:25:32.524 --> 00:25:35.796\nAnd WordPress is handling where\nit goes and what it's doing and\n\n435\n00:25:35.796 --> 00:25:37.830\nall that fun extra stuff.\n\n436\n00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.700\nNow to actually save it,\nthat's where we're gonna get a meta and\n\n437\n00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.169\nthat's where we're gonna\nbe in the next episode.\n\n438\n00:25:44.319 --> 00:25:47.171\nAll right, so\nright now we can create a user.\n\n439\n00:25:47.171 --> 00:25:50.428\nWe can check to see if the username\nexists, the email exists,\n\n440\n00:25:50.428 --> 00:25:52.580\nwe can generate a password.\n\n441\n00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.470\nIn most cases,\n\n442\n00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.610\ndepending on how your website is set up,\nonce the user is created and\n\n443\n00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.880\nemail gets fired with the password\ndepending on how your site is set up.\n\n444\n00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.380\nSo that really depends on scenario there.\n\n445\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.350\nBut if it doesn't,\n\n446\n00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.210\nthen you wanna have some script here\nprobably to handle that part of it.\n\n447\n00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.723\nOnce they're added, then you can add\ncapabilities or remove capabilities, add\n\n448\n00:26:11.723 --> 00:26:15.325\nroles, things along those lines depending\non the exact structure of your website.\n\n449\n00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:20.056\nAnd then from there you'll wanna\nuse this edit user profile and\n\n450\n00:26:20.056 --> 00:26:25.280\nshow user profile to add fields\nto profile if you need to.\n\n451\n00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.910\nAnd that is creating and getting\nstarted with the users in a nutshell.\n\n452\n00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:30.757\n&gt;&gt; Well, Frank,\n\n453\n00:26:30.757 --> 00:26:35.194\nthere's a lot going on there that I asked\nsome questions cuz I was rumbling around\n\n454\n00:26:35.194 --> 00:26:37.881\nin my mind when you started\ntalking about roles.\n\n455\n00:26:37.881 --> 00:26:40.062\nI'm sure that will keep\ncoming up in capabilities.\n\n456\n00:26:40.062 --> 00:26:41.840\nThat will continue to come up.\n\n457\n00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.060\nBut programmatic creation of users and\n\n458\n00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.380\nmanipulation of user information\ncan be incredibly helpful,\n\n459\n00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:51.270\nespecially if you wanna go,\nI really wanna do this tweak here or\n\n460\n00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.880\nI wanna make sure this happens and maybe\nthat's not part of your natural system.\n\n461\n00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.500\nSo definitely, if you need to,\nrewatch this episode.\n\n462\n00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.661\nOtherwise, we gotta talk about user meta,\nbut\n\n463\n00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:02.724\nwe're out of time to do\nthat in this episode.\n\n464\n00:27:02.724 --> 00:27:05.420\nSo we're gonna get out of here,\nbut definitely stay tuned.\n\n465\n00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.710\nWe got more coming at you.\n\n466\n00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.756\nBut for now, signing up for DEVPro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Denison.\n\n467\n00:27:09.756 --> 00:27:11.089\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Frank Corso.\n\n468\n00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:11.907\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n469\n00:27:11.907 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.836\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and well,\n\n4\n00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:22.984\nwe're continuing on our WordPress\ndevelopment, well, extravaganza.\n\n5\n00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:25.124\nAnd we weren't quite finished\ntalking about user, so\n\n6\n00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:27.060\nwe're gonna talk about user meta today.\n\n7\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.088\nAnd here to help us along in that\nvery endeavor, the one, the only, Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:31.893\nFrank Corso.\n\n9\n00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:33.924\nHow are you doing today, Frank?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, how are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:35.480\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.020\nNow, I've heard the term\nmeta thrown around.\n\n12\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.470\nMetadata, metaphysics, but\n\n13\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.630\nuser meta, can you just tell us what we're\nactually gonna be talking about today?\n\n14\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.210\nYou know, with user meta,\nit's really complex, so\n\n15\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.850\nwe might as well do metaphysics.\n\n16\n00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.050\nThat's probably an easier\nconcept to understand.\n\n17\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.630\nBut realistically, we briefly touched on\nthis in the last episode, but essentially,\n\n18\n00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.710\nall of the data that's attached to a user\nis stored in something called user meta.\n\n19\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.570\nAnd so, for example, we had a field\n\n20\n00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.980\ncalled location that we briefly added\ntowards the end of the last episode.\n\n21\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.550\nAnd so when we go to save that,\nthat's gonna be stored as a user meta,\n\n22\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.220\nand it's gonna be the location\nin the user meta.\n\n23\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.590\nSo in the database of users there's\na table that's also a user meta,\n\n24\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.670\nand inside there, there's different\nvalues attached to different users.\n\n25\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.800\nThis could be anything, it could have\nlocation, it could be Twitter handle,\n\n26\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.290\nit could be LinkedIn profile link,\nit could be, maybe,\n\n27\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.490\nfavorite color,\nanything you might want to get displayed.\n\n28\n00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.110\nSo for example maybe somewhere\non the website if you\n\n29\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.830\nhave posts you might have\nan About The Author section.\n\n30\n00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.180\nThere might be like a Twitter link,\na Facebook link,\n\n31\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.740\na LinkedIn link, maybe a lengthy bio\nthat's longer than the regular bio,\n\n32\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.700\nmaybe there's a personal website URL.\n\n33\n00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.480\nAll those things you could\nstore into the user meta.\n\n34\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.220\nLikewise, maybe you have a different\nspot where you just have the site admin\n\n35\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.280\ninformation or something.\n\n36\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.840\nAnd you could have that sort into\nthe administrator's user meta.\n\n37\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.210\nSo let's turn to the laptop screen for\na second, and\n\n38\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.050\nwe will open back up that profile page.\n\n39\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.030\nAnd all the way at the bottom,\nwe had added this location.\n\n40\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.660\nAnd this is just one of the many different\ntypes of things you could add here.\n\n41\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.150\nYou could add birth date here,\nyou could add favorite color.\n\n42\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.589\nYou could add all different\nkinds of things, and\n\n43\n00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.218\nthese items here would be\nstored into the user meta.\n\n44\n00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:19.877\nSo what we're going to do is we are going\nto store this location into the user meta,\n\n45\n00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:22.270\nand then actually try to retrieve it.\n\n46\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.500\nSo the first thing we wanna do is\nlook at these two other hooks.\n\n47\n00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.930\nSo in the last episode,\nlet me scroll up so you can see here,\n\n48\n00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.530\nwe looked at the show user profile and\nthe edit user profile hooks.\n\n49\n00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.820\nAnd these are the hooks that\nget fired on the profile page\n\n50\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.421\nat the bottom before\nthe button gets shown.\n\n51\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.290\nAnd that's where we added\nthis nice little table.\n\n52\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.895\nAnd this is some mark up for WordPress.\n\n53\n00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:49.680\nAnd WordPress has these classes and\ndifferent things and\n\n54\n00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.920\nthey do this styling for\nus to match their styling.\n\n55\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.810\nSo we have a table, with a cluster form\ntable and that's just the WordPress way.\n\n56\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.046\nWe could have a header here,\nmaybe we have extra meta stuff.\n\n57\n00:03:04.362 --> 00:03:07.930\nAnd theoretically, we could add it there.\n\n58\n00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.990\nWe have an extra heading so maybe at\nthe bottom we could say Bio Information,\n\n59\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.650\nor About You, or things like that, and\nwe could have our fields underneath that.\n\n60\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.300\nWe could try to create\na new section in it.\n\n61\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.190\nAnd then within it we have our trs,\nor ths, or\n\n62\n00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.300\ntds and\nthese are all just different components.\n\n63\n00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.360\nOf the table that WordPress will\nuse to style it correctly and\n\n64\n00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.995\nthen put our fields up to\nmatch the rest of the profile.\n\n65\n00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:32.690\nAnd this is the same setup.\n\n66\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.613\nAs we continue, you'll see the same\nstructure quite a bit within the settings\n\n67\n00:03:35.613 --> 00:03:38.327\nthat we create, for different pages\nthat we might create in the future.\n\n68\n00:03:38.327 --> 00:03:41.710\nBecause WordPress uses this standard\nall over the place, for the most part.\n\n69\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.410\nSo most of this is stuff that you've\nprobably seen before if you've played\n\n70\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.370\nwith HTML.\n\n71\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.120\nHere's our escape HTML.\n\n72\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.420\nThere's a little extra thing to it,\nwe haven't gotten to that yet,\n\n73\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.410\nwe'll get there.\n\n74\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.000\nBut there's our escape HTML\nwe've talked about previously.\n\n75\n00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.710\nBut then last but not least,\nthere's our escape attribute as well.\n\n76\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.430\nBut last but not least, you'll see t\nhis new thing called get_user_meta.\n\n77\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.050\nAnd what this does is it retrieves this\ndata that we've stored into this key\n\n78\n00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.000\nin the user meta.\n\n79\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.140\nSo in our case we're gonna\ncall this user location.\n\n80\n00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.590\nNow like the options before and\nthe settings we've talked about before and\n\n81\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.040\nthe slugs,\nyou can name this whatever you want.\n\n82\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.160\nBut you probably wanna do\nsomething that's going to\n\n83\n00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.290\nnot conflict with another plugin or\nthing that might also have this option.\n\n84\n00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.740\nSo in our case, we're gonna pretend\nthat no other plugin in the theme world\n\n85\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.410\nhas this user location one.\n\n86\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.410\nIn reality,\nthey probably have user location.\n\n87\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.270\nSo we could, theoretically, if we're\ncontinuing their naming convention,\n\n88\n00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.890\nwe could do fc_user_location.\n\n89\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.330\nIf this was your plugin\ncalled My first plugin.\n\n90\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.759\nWe could do myfp_user.\n\n91\n00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.430\nSomething along those lines to\ndifferentiate it a little bit.\n\n92\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.860\nFor us,\nwe're just going to keep user_location\n\n93\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.850\nbecause I've already played\naround with that one.\n\n94\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.790\nNow, the get_user_meta,\nif you try to search for\n\n95\n00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.450\nthis on Google, Bing, DuckDuckgo, you\nmight come across get_usermeta one word.\n\n96\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.600\nThat is the older function,\nthat's deprecated.\n\n97\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.568\nThe one you're looking for\nis get_user_meta.\n\n98\n00:05:06.568 --> 00:05:10.801\nAnd in this case,\nit's going to take three parameters,\n\n99\n00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:14.890\nthe user_id,\nthe string of the metakey and single.\n\n100\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.700\nThis is going to be a thing we're going\nto see quite a bit going forward.\n\n101\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.260\nIt's asking do you want to return this\nas an array or are you looking for\n\n102\n00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.260\na single value?\n\n103\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.580\nIn our case, we're storing it\nuser location as a string.\n\n104\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.820\nWe're storing that string in,\nso we want a single value.\n\n105\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.450\nWe don't want an array because we don't\nwant to worry about converting that array\n\n106\n00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.260\nand blah, blah,\nblah because we only have one value.\n\n107\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.140\nSo we're going to say yes there,\nwe're going to say send that to true.\n\n108\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.160\nNow, this key,\n\n109\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.400\nit's almost the same thing as our options\nkey that we've played with before.\n\n110\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.870\nWe've played with other\nplaces that have keys.\n\n111\n00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.566\nIt's pretty much the same thing.\n\n112\n00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:49.330\nIt's the slug, the name,\nthe ID of this value, the variable name.\n\n113\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.980\nAll those could be similar\nthings of the meta key.\n\n114\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.540\nSo in our case,\nlet me step back real quick.\n\n115\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.397\nThe show user profile and\nedit user profile.\n\n116\n00:06:01.397 --> 00:06:04.410\nThese hooks, we pass this function here.\n\n117\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.450\nAnd this function will\npass us a WP user object.\n\n118\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.950\nIn the last episode,\nwe touched on the WP user class.\n\n119\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.330\nThis is a class that handles\nmost of the user functionality.\n\n120\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.260\nAnd when call, when you create a WP user,\nwith an integer of the ID,\n\n121\n00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.940\nit creates an instance of a user.\n\n122\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.220\nSo in this case whenever we\nhook into this it passes us\n\n123\n00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.190\nthe user that that profile is for.\n\n124\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.455\nSo if we step back it goes to,\nthe profile we're on,\n\n125\n00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:36.440\nin this case we have our\nadministrator named Frank.\n\n126\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.105\nWhen we view this page,\nit passes us a profile user and\n\n127\n00:06:41.105 --> 00:06:48.692\nthat user is in this case Frank, because\nhe's the user whose profile we're viewing.\n\n128\n00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:57.030\nNow inside this user object\nthere's a property of ID.\n\n129\n00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.890\nSo we can use that to go\ninto the get_user_meta.\n\n130\n00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.970\nWe're gonna pass it this ID.\n\n131\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.500\nOur key is going to be user_location and\nwe want the single to be set to true,\n\n132\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.720\nbecause we only want that one value.\n\n133\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.470\nAnd we don't have to worry about array\nconversions or things like that.\n\n134\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.775\nSo we're gonna hop down.\n\n135\n00:07:15.775 --> 00:07:19.504\nNow that we have our user and we have\nour location, let's scroll back down so\n\n136\n00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:20.220\nwe can see it.\n\n137\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.740\nSo we have our location, I typed in test,\nwe have everything set up.\n\n138\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.708\nIf we were to hit Update Profile,\nActually,\n\n139\n00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:33.380\nremove the word test, because I did\nalready say this before, so change this.\n\n140\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.400\nSo say my location is green\nbecause that sounds right.\n\n141\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.640\nAnd if we scroll back down right now\nit's still going to say test because\n\n142\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.370\nthat's what I stored in previously.\n\n143\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.060\nBecause we didn't actually put any\ncode in here to save the user meta.\n\n144\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.790\nSo what we're going to do next\nis look at these two new hooks.\n\n145\n00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.310\nSo this first one if I can scroll up,\nwhere?\n\n146\n00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:55.810\nThere we go.\n\n147\n00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.510\nEdit user profile update.\n\n148\n00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.410\nAnd this is where,\nwhenever you update a profile,\n\n149\n00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.830\nwhen you click that save button,\nit fires this hook.\n\n150\n00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.860\nHowever, there's two hooks we have to\nuse because there's this other one\n\n151\n00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.270\ncalled personal options update and this\nis when you're saving your own profile.\n\n152\n00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.750\nWordPress doesn't have a way for you to\nhook in one time across all profiles.\n\n153\n00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.090\nThey've one for other user profiles and\nthen there is one for your own profile.\n\n154\n00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.230\nSo you have to hook in both in most cases.\n\n155\n00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:32.814\nSo in our case, were going to copy this\nand duplicate this one for the other one.\n\n156\n00:08:32.814 --> 00:08:35.191\nWe scroll down here and paste that, and\n\n157\n00:08:35.191 --> 00:08:38.878\nthen scroll up a little bit so\nyou can see there, there we go.\n\n158\n00:08:38.878 --> 00:08:42.730\nAnd I don't know why I'm indented so\nfunny there.\n\n159\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.483\nSo we're gonna go back and\ncopy and paste this one too.\n\n160\n00:08:47.483 --> 00:08:49.350\nLet's see, is there a hook that I can?\n\n161\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.220\nThere it is.\n\n162\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.070\nSo let's take a look at this hook.\n\n163\n00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.510\nNow, we talked about already that there's\ntwo different hooks we're hooking into.\n\n164\n00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.765\nOne is the edit_user_profile_update and\n\n165\n00:08:58.765 --> 00:09:02.109\nthe other one is\nthe personal options update.\n\n166\n00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:04.740\nNow, both of these pass\nthe same parameter.\n\n167\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.500\nThey're going to be giving us\nthe user ID to our function.\n\n168\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.401\nSo we're gonna hop back over here, and\nwe're gonna add in our user ID, and\n\n169\n00:09:12.401 --> 00:09:15.710\nsince we've already talked about\ncoding standards let's go ahead and\n\n170\n00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.730\ndo this the right way.\n\n171\n00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.143\nJust so you can see this being, oops,\n\n172\n00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:24.096\nforgot the actual ENT and\nthe ID of the user.\n\n173\n00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:26.710\nNow, once inside of this field,\nit gives us the user ID.\n\n174\n00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.430\nAnd this function will be called\nwhen someone saves the form.\n\n175\n00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.274\nSo it's saved and then our form,\nor our field that we added before,\n\n176\n00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:39.030\nour user location,\nwill be currently in the POST data.\n\n177\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.240\nSo we can retrieve that,\nwe could do something like this.\n\n178\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.142\nAnd we're just gonna pretend we're\ndoing this the right way for a second.\n\n179\n00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:50.280\nAnd what did I say, user location?\n\n180\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.340\nI think that's right, user_location.\n\n181\n00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.220\nSo we can retrieve\nthe location using this.\n\n182\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.800\nSo they went, we have our function here.\n\n183\n00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.640\nIt creates the input\nwith name_user_location.\n\n184\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.740\nThere on their profile page at\nthe bottom is our location field.\n\n185\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.820\nThey type in green.\n\n186\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.130\nThey click the save line.\n\n187\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.760\nNow it calls our update function.\n\n188\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.700\nAnd right now we're getting our user\nlocation and storing it to a variable.\n\n189\n00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.870\nNow what we should be doing is\nsanitizing this value so let's sanitize.\n\n190\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.190\nIf you remember before we\nhad sanitized text field.\n\n191\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.730\nAnd that way they don't type in some\nrandom SQL and get all of our username and\n\n192\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.200\npasswords.\n\n193\n00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.110\nSo we're going to do that.\n\n194\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:34.330\nWe're going to sanitize it and\nthen we're going to,\n\n195\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.690\nbefore we did up here if you recall.\n\n196\n00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.130\nLet me see where is it at?\n\n197\n00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:44.550\nWhen we have get_user_meta, and\nfrom the user ID, we're getting the key.\n\n198\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.570\nWe're gonna do pretty much the exact\nopposite now and instead of getting,\n\n199\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.160\nwe're going to use this function,\nupdate_user_meta.\n\n200\n00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.990\nAnd this, if you look,\nit takes almost the same exact parameters.\n\n201\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.687\nWe have our user ID.\n\n202\n00:10:56.687 --> 00:10:57.900\nWe have this string meta_key.\n\n203\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.020\nAnd this time it's gonna accept\na value as the third parameter.\n\n204\n00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.949\nSo we're gonna come down here, and\nwe're gonna do update_user_meta.\n\n205\n00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:09.100\nAnd we can pass the user ID.\n\n206\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.220\nAnd we can do,\nwhat did we call this up here?\n\n207\n00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.080\nThe key.\nI wanna say we did an FC, right?\n\n208\n00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.830\nNope, no we didn't.\n\n209\n00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.720\nSo we're just gonna copy that to make\nsure we get it in the right one.\n\n210\n00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.620\nAnd scroll back down to\nwhere you can see it.\n\n211\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.700\nAnd then we're gonna pass our new field,\nour new value location.\n\n212\n00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.270\nNow let's check.\n\n213\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.070\nThat's VIP stuff again so\nwe can ignore that underline.\n\n214\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.060\nNow, if we have this, all right, we have\nit hooked up, we have this hooked up,\n\n215\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.640\nthe field, okay, let's take a look.\n\n216\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.158\nMaybe refresh this page,\nso we can get that.\n\n217\n00:11:48.123 --> 00:11:49.061\nTry that again, Frank.\n\n218\n00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:53.750\nLet's refresh,\nmake sure our location's still there.\n\n219\n00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.750\nWe're gonna change it to,\nlet's do green again,\n\n220\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.880\nbecause that's definitely\na location we could be in.\n\n221\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.320\nAnd let's scroll down,\n\n222\n00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.800\nand our green now saved, because we\nused this function here big fields.\n\n223\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.890\nSo we sanitize the value, and then we use\nupdate user meta to save our location and\n\n224\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.660\nour key of user location,\n\n225\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.500\nwhich is stored to the user ID that we\nare passed, who's profile we're viewing.\n\n226\n00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.648\nSo just to recap that whole cycle again,\nwe used these two hooks,\n\n227\n00:12:22.648 --> 00:12:24.810\nshow_user_profile and edit_user_profile.\n\n228\n00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.390\nWe added a function to that,\nwhich is this really long one here,\n\n229\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.960\nwhich receives the user profile.\n\n230\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.980\nWe then output a field\ncalled user_location.\n\n231\n00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:41.343\nWhere we output, using get_user_meta, the\nvalues stored in the key user location and\n\n232\n00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:45.575\nthen when someone submits that,\nthese two hooks down here are fired.\n\n233\n00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:50.076\nPersonal options update and\nedit user profile update which cause our\n\n234\n00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:53.808\nfunction FC update fields,\nwhich passes us the user ID.\n\n235\n00:12:53.808 --> 00:12:57.042\nWhich we can then use to\nupdate the user meta of user\n\n236\n00:12:57.042 --> 00:13:00.310\nlocation with the new value\nsort into the user ID.\n\n237\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.130\nDoes that sorta make sense?\n\n238\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.368\nHow that cycle works?\n&gt;&gt; I get that.\n\n239\n00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:07.780\nAnd just to recap, the reason we have\nthose two hooks is because one is for\n\n240\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.800\nyou and one is for\nother users, is that right?\n\n241\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.730\nDo I have that right, Frank?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n242\n00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.100\nSo just to recap on that,\nyou see we have two hooks for the edit and\n\n243\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.860\ntwo hooks for the update.\n\n244\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.250\nOne is for when you're editing\nanother user's profile, and\n\n245\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.320\none is when you're\nediting your own profile.\n\n246\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.870\nSo unfortunately, how WordPress developed,\nit was two separate systems for a while.\n\n247\n00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.870\nAnd most of these now they've kind\nof combined it to one main system.\n\n248\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.770\nBut this part is still part of this\nlegacy, it would be really hard for\n\n249\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.120\nthem to change it now.\n\n250\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.400\nBut maybe in someday in the future,\nwe'll see these combine.\n\n251\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.270\nBut for now, you need to do both hooks.\n&gt;&gt; Follow-up question, so\n\n252\n00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.650\nwe see that $_post.\n\n253\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.270\nThat has a red line under it.\n\n254\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:52.313\nBased on what we've talked about on\ncoding standards, should we use $_post,\n\n255\n00:13:52.313 --> 00:13:54.307\nor what is that error about?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n256\n00:13:54.307 --> 00:14:00.550\nthe $_post is the PHP global variable for\ngetting any POST data.\n\n257\n00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.250\nSo essentially, these underlines will\nappear when you're doing that and\n\n258\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.650\nsaying hey,\nit probably needs to be validated.\n\n259\n00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.283\nNow, in our case, we are validating\nusing sanitize_text_field.\n\n260\n00:14:08.283 --> 00:14:11.900\nSo our code sniffer doesn't quite catch\nthat, because it's just saying hey,\n\n261\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.810\nyou're using post,\nmake sure you're sanitizing this right.\n\n262\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.730\nNow we could have taken a step further\nand, maybe it's a drop down, and\n\n263\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.980\nwe could have done a switch case or\nsomething along those lines.\n\n264\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.670\nBut for us as long as we sanitize\nthe text field that's going to be enough\n\n265\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.010\nespecially going into update user meta\nwhich has its own sanitation checks.\n\n266\n00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.910\nThat's why you're going to\nsee any time you use POST or\n\n267\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.160\nGET you're probably going\nto get the underline.\n\n268\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.560\nSo that you're like hey, make sure\nthat you're sanitizing this correctly.\n\n269\n00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.050\n&gt;&gt; And as we said before,\n\n270\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.390\nthese lenders like PHP coding standards,\nthey're not perfect.\n\n271\n00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.995\nSometimes, they'll throw underlines,\nor they won't.\n\n272\n00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:47.750\nThere's the two cases.\n\n273\n00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.920\nThis is underlining something\njust as a reminder but\n\n274\n00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.590\neven though we\nare fulfilling the reminder.\n\n275\n00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.170\nWe're sanitizing,\nwhich is a part of the validation.\n\n276\n00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.110\nIt's still underlines that,\nthere's nothing we can do about that.\n\n277\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.840\nLikewise, we can also have things\nthat maybe should be underlined that\n\n278\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.410\naren't going be catched.\n\n279\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.880\nSo, tooling is great.\n\n280\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.970\nIt will be incredibly helpful, but\nnot necessarily always perfect.\n\n281\n00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.590\nBut, from here we see how this update.\n\n282\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.885\nDo we know, do we need to know\nmuch more about user meta, or\n\n283\n00:15:14.885 --> 00:15:18.490\nare we good to go from here?\n&gt;&gt; Well, now, once you have that,\n\n284\n00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.589\nyou probably want to display it somewhere.\n\n285\n00:15:20.589 --> 00:15:22.860\nSo there's actually two tricks for this.\n\n286\n00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.630\nAnd they almost do the same exact thing,\n\n287\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.160\nso we could use the get_user_meta\nthat we've been using.\n\n288\n00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.920\nYou could pass the user ID like we\ndid up here, let me scroll back up.\n\n289\n00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.430\nIt was somewhere,\nI want to say at the end.\n\n290\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.640\nSo at the end here we had\nour get_user_meta, and\n\n291\n00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.380\nyou could pass an ID somewhere, maybe in\nthe side bar, the footer, the header,\n\n292\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.820\nthe navigation, somewhere like that.\n\n293\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.640\nAnd you could pass a user ID and get some\nkey and you're going to get some value.\n\n294\n00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.340\nSo this is great for,\nmaybe you have some information somewhere,\n\n295\n00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.480\nif they're logged in,\nin their panel somewhere,\n\n296\n00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.380\nyou might have a hey, Frank,\nwhose hair color is green.\n\n297\n00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.580\nOr hey, something along those lines,\nor you could have something like that.\n\n298\n00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.200\nAnd you would use this get_user_meta and\necho it out somewhere, escaping it.\n\n299\n00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.830\nNow what you could also use\nis this other function here.\n\n300\n00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.600\nThis get_the_author_meta.\n\n301\n00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.940\nAnd what this is, so if inside your\npost or page, you have a box for\n\n302\n00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.730\nan author box with an author bio and\nsome links to their profiles.\n\n303\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:18.568\nThings along those lines.\n\n304\n00:16:18.568 --> 00:16:23.109\nThis get_the_author_meta\nwill get the meta field and,\n\n305\n00:16:23.109 --> 00:16:26.027\nusing whoever's ID is of the author.\n\n306\n00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:30.269\nSo for example, if we go back to front\nend, inside texting post, right now,\n\n307\n00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:34.319\ninside the loop, which we've talked\nabout in a few different episodes,\n\n308\n00:16:34.319 --> 00:16:38.220\nit loops through, gets the title,\nthe date, the text inside.\n\n309\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.765\nAt that point, the user ID of the author\nis set, so you can use this function here,\n\n310\n00:16:43.765 --> 00:16:47.330\nget_the_author_meta, with\nthe parameter userlocation.\n\n311\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:53.480\nAnd it would output the user location for\nthe author, passing the author's ID.\n\n312\n00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.540\nSo you can use either one,\njust depending on where you're using it.\n\n313\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.169\nSo we're putting something in a sidebar,\nor in the navigation, or\n\n314\n00:17:00.169 --> 00:17:03.815\nin some external page or somewhat,\nwe would use get_user_meta.\n\n315\n00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:07.027\nBut if we're putting something inside\nthe actual loop, inside the content,\n\n316\n00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:08.960\nthen you could use get_the_author_meta.\n\n317\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.270\nAnd between the two is how you would end\nup displaying this information somewhere.\n\n318\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.630\n&gt;&gt; And that makes a great deal of sense.\n\n319\n00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.200\nLet me make sure I'm\nphrasing the question.\n\n320\n00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.720\nYou say experiments depended on context,\n\n321\n00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.208\nare there any gotcha's that we need to\nbe aware of between those two usages?\n\n322\n00:17:29.208 --> 00:17:33.296\nOther than the fact that you need to make\nsure you have the current author set, or\n\n323\n00:17:33.296 --> 00:17:35.736\nare there any other\nthings that we should be,\n\n324\n00:17:35.736 --> 00:17:38.970\nthis is gonna get you from time to time.\n&gt;&gt; Not really, these are fairly\n\n325\n00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.670\nstraightforward in that you have\nthe user meta and then the author meta.\n\n326\n00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.870\nIf you're ever unsure,\njust use the user meta.\n\n327\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:48.520\nIf you have the ID and you're unsure,\njust use user meta, and\n\n328\n00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.985\nthat will be the overarching one\nthat you use most of the time.\n\n329\n00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:55.440\nThe get the author is in the specific\ncase where you're inside a loop and\n\n330\n00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.990\nthe ID's already set.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n331\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.680\nFrank well,\nthere you have it ladies and gentlemen.\n\n332\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.610\nWe have started to see user\nmeta can be incredibly helpful.\n\n333\n00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.730\nEspecially if we're doing kind\nof these custom fields and\n\n334\n00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.000\nwe're gathering custom information.\n\n335\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.200\nAnd, well I can see in the back of my mind\nthis is going continue to come up over and\n\n336\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:13.990\nover again.\n\n337\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.820\nBut definitely stay tuned, we have more\nWordPress development coming at you.\n\n338\n00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.010\nBut for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n339\n00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.180\nSo signing off for DevProTV.\n\n340\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.873\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Frank Corsa.\n\n341\n00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:24.268\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n342\n00:18:24.268 --> 00:18:30.329\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:18.329\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.060\nwe're continuing on with our\nWordPress development adventure.\n\n5\n00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.370\nAnd in particular, in this episode,\nwe're going to be talking about post meta.\n\n6\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.490\nWell you've already seen usermeta.\n\n7\n00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.390\nBut now we're going to\ntalk about post meta.\n\n8\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.860\nAnd well, that's all I know about that,\nand luckily we have someone in studio,\n\n9\n00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.270\nthe man, the myth,\nthe legend, Mr. Frank Corso.\n\n10\n00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.650\nHow are you doing today Frank?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well,\n\n11\n00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.540\nhow are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.450\nSo as far as we've seen some of\nthe utility in a previous episode for\n\n13\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.460\nuser meta, right?\n\n14\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.860\nSaving some of this custom information.\n\n15\n00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.440\nIs it the same story for post meta?\n&gt;&gt; Almost.\n\n16\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.590\nSo when it comes to WordPress,\nwe talked a lot about how this comes from\n\n17\n00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.250\nblogging software originally,\nback in 2003.\n\n18\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.520\nIt started off as blogging software,\nso everything was posts at the time.\n\n19\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.200\nBut over time, we have already\ntalked about custom post types and\n\n20\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.490\nsome other uses for it.\n\n21\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.800\nBut they are still stored as posts.\n\n22\n00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.810\nBut there are still going to be times\nthat you want to add additional\n\n23\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.840\ninformation for it.\n\n24\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840\nSo if you remember back when we were\nbuilding some e-commerce fake products,\n\n25\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.650\nthere might have been times that you would\nhave added additional information to it.\n\n26\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.450\nSo maybe you wanted to add different\nsizes they could choose from,\n\n27\n00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.650\nfor maybe shirts and stuff or\nmaybe you wanted to add different colors.\n\n28\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.797\nMaybe it's some sort of product\nthey're selling, and so\n\n29\n00:01:26.797 --> 00:01:29.700\nyou have a custom post called Software or\nDownloads.\n\n30\n00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.977\nAnd you want it to have, maybe,\na change log in there, or\n\n31\n00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:33.454\nyou want to have a last updated date.\n\n32\n00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:37.073\nThings along those lines would all\nbe extra values you want to add to\n\n33\n00:01:37.073 --> 00:01:37.950\na post-type.\n\n34\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.090\nAnd you can do that by using post-meta.\n\n35\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.990\nSo the last episode, we talked about\nuser-meta where we added a location field\n\n36\n00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.680\nto the user profile and that value\nof location got stored to the user.\n\n37\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.570\nAnd each user can have\na different location value.\n\n38\n00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.390\nSame thing with host.\n\n39\n00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.500\nSo if you have your custom host type of\nproduct, or downloads, or PDFs, or videos,\n\n40\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.045\nor podcasts,\nyou could attach extra information to it.\n\n41\n00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:03.535\nSo any of the custom post site of Podcast,\nand that's we have your\n\n42\n00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:08.345\nnew Podcast episode every week or every\nday, you got a value of episode link.\n\n43\n00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:12.545\nMaybe the hosted are on, things along\nthose lines that you could then show\n\n44\n00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:15.635\nat any actual information\nwhen someone goes to view it.\n\n45\n00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.850\nSo let's jump to the laptop screen.\n\n46\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.090\nAnd first, what we're going to do is,\nwe're going to get our ID for\n\n47\n00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.780\nthis post because that's what\nwe're going to play with.\n\n48\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.540\nThis is 195.\n\n49\n00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.040\nWe'll have to remember 195.\n\n50\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.390\nThen we're going to hop\nback over to our code here.\n\n51\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.400\nWe're going to come on out\nof our user stuff because\n\n52\n00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.620\nwe're not going to play\nwith that right now.\n\n53\n00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.630\nLet me, actually why don't\nwe just delete it for now.\n\n54\n00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.340\nWe'll get back to that.\n\n55\n00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.780\nWhat we're going to do right now.\n\n56\n00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.000\nIs we're gonna build out, if I can.\n\n57\n00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.880\nThere we go.\n\n58\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.330\nNope, that's not the right one.\n\n59\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.270\nWhat about over here?\n\n60\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.130\nThat's still not.\n\n61\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.330\nWhere did it?\n\n62\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.470\nThere it is.\n\n63\n00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.510\nSo last episode we played with get user\nmeta and if we look we have get_post_meta.\n\n64\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.830\nAnd it takes the same exact parameters,\nand it returns the same exact thing.\n\n65\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.050\nSo the beautiful thing about\nWordPress is almost always,\n\n66\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.690\nexcept options and\ntransits, you'll find that\n\n67\n00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.040\nthe function names are almost all\nthe same even if you go across types.\n\n68\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.460\nSo we have get username.\n\n69\n00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.830\nIt's going to be get hostname.\n\n70\n00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.920\nYou can imagine if we had update usermeta,\nwe're going to have an update hostmeta.\n\n71\n00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.400\nSo let's jump at the gut, post meta first\nand we're going to use a new filter.\n\n72\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.660\nSo if you remember with filters, they were\na way that you can add or change content.\n\n73\n00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.340\nSo, they're similar to hooks, or\n\n74\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.510\nhooks get fired and then you can add\nfunctions to run during that hook.\n\n75\n00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.640\nWell filters allow you to receive some\ncontent, manipulate it and then return\n\n76\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.860\nit back to WordPress so WordPress\ncan do something with that content.\n\n77\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.480\nSo this filter is a very popular one.\n\n78\n00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.300\nOnce you get going, you're probably\ngonna encounter this filter quite a bit.\n\n79\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.040\nBut this is called The Content.\n\n80\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.450\nSo if you remember the loop, the loop is\nwhere it's cycling over a post or pages or\n\n81\n00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.560\ncontent that happened in a query.\n\n82\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.410\nAnd during that time when it goes inside\nthe loop, it gathers the content up and\n\n83\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.770\nthen has this filter the_content.\n\n84\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.480\nSo you can manipulate that content.\n\n85\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.620\nSo you can add author box\nat the bottom of the page.\n\n86\n00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.661\nYou can add a feature image\nat the beginning of the page,\n\n87\n00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:03.056\nthings along those lines.\n\n88\n00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:06.382\nYou can manipulate the content of\na page or a post or post type,\n\n89\n00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:08.350\nthings along those lines.\n\n90\n00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.580\nSo what we're going to do is add some\npost meta at the bottom of the content.\n\n91\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.410\nSo to do that we're going\nto hop over here and\n\n92\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.610\nuse our add filter function\nthat we've used before.\n\n93\n00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.500\nAnd we're going to do the content and\nwe're going to create a new function for\n\n94\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.846\nadd content.\n\n95\n00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:30.630\nAnd we're going to create our new\nfunction here fc add content.\n\n96\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.550\nThat's a weird indent.\n\n97\n00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.600\nDriving me nuts, let me, there we go.\n\n98\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.450\nAnd then, we're gonna go and create\nour function here, and now the filter\n\n99\n00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.540\nfunction, or the content filter,\nthis sends over a content value.\n\n100\n00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.770\nAnd what this variable does is it gives\nyou all the content within that post or\n\n101\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.243\npage or product or download or podcast,\nwhatever the content is in that loop.\n\n102\n00:05:01.243 --> 00:05:06.120\nSo in our case, we're gonna do, so\nwe are going to have a random thing.\n\n103\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.670\nWe're just gonna call it color.\n\n104\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.670\nWe're gonna do get_post_meta.\n\n105\n00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.320\nNow, we're gonna scroll over.\n\n106\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.940\nIn this case, r was 195, I think 195?\n\n107\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.630\nYeah, 195.\nSo, the parameters we're looking for\n\n108\n00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.790\nare the $post_id, the $key, and\nthen $single, just like we had before.\n\n109\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.420\nSo, in this case,\nwe're just going to say 195.\n\n110\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.440\nWe're gonna hard code it for now And\n\n111\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.370\nwe're gonna pretend there was a color\nvalue and it's gonna be true, single.\n\n112\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.399\nAnd then what we can do is, so content\n\n113\n00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:45.760\nequals content and color.\n\n114\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.130\nActually, we're gonna add\nan extra br in there,\n\n115\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.620\njust to give us a little bit of space.\n\n116\n00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.530\nAnd then we can return the content.\n\n117\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.330\nSo what this does, is takes the content.\n\n118\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.810\nYeah, let's put there,\nis it gets the content from the post or\n\n119\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.490\nthe page, in our case we're just gonna\nget it from a very specific post.\n\n120\n00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.460\nAnd then we're going to get that, we're\ngonna look to see if there's a post meta\n\n121\n00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.540\nof color, which in this case, we aren't\ndone yet but we're gonna pretend there is.\n\n122\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.110\nAnd we're gonna get this color and\n\n123\n00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.360\nwe're going to add it at\nthe very bottom of the content.\n\n124\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.150\nAnd then we're gonna return that so\n\n125\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.100\nthat Word Press can then do\nsomething with that content.\n\n126\n00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.680\nSo I'm gonna make sure add filters there.\n\n127\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.600\nSo, we're gonna hop over here and\nactually,\n\n128\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.410\nwhy don't we put color just so\nwe can see it show up.\n\n129\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.800\nAnd we're gonna hop back over here.\n\n130\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.780\nAnd here is our,\nlet me make that a little bigger for you.\n\n131\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.080\nThere we go.\nSo there's our color.\n\n132\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.820\nAnd since there's not actually a value for\ncolor right now, that's blank.\n\n133\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.260\nBut there's our color at the very bottom.\n\n134\n00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.630\nSo if we were, let's add some\ncontent in here just so you can see.\n\n135\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.980\nLet me go back, edit this, just so\nyou can see that it's at the bottom.\n\n136\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.840\nWe're going to pretend\nthere is some content here.\n\n137\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.086\nSome random content.\n\n138\n00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:06.520\nWe're going to go down here and save it.\n\n139\n00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.330\nSo it's saved.\n\n140\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.610\nNow back over here and refresh.\n\n141\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.370\nJust so we can see.\n\n142\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.190\nThere is some random content and we added\nan extra break in there using BR and\n\n143\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.860\nthere's our color.\n\n144\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.095\nSo this was a product, you could have\nvarious post meta at the bottom there, or\n\n145\n00:07:24.095 --> 00:07:27.468\nwe could have put an author box down\nthere and use get user meta and\n\n146\n00:07:27.468 --> 00:07:28.739\nget some author stuff.\n\n147\n00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:31.770\nAnd then we can use get post meta to\nget some information about the post and\n\n148\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.220\nhas some sort of box at the bottom.\n\n149\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.460\nNow let's actually create some post meta.\n\n150\n00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.910\nSo that, we're gonna come over\nhere to nope, update post_meta.\n\n151\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.950\nAnd you can imagine, this works\nalmost the same way as the user_meta.\n\n152\n00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.890\nSo we scroll down here.\n\n153\n00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.440\nWe have update.\n\n154\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.090\nWe ask for\nthe post_id before it was the user_id.\n\n155\n00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.760\nWe have the meta_key, meta_value,\njust like we did with the user.\n\n156\n00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.610\nExcept there's an extra one\nhere called prev_value.\n\n157\n00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd what this is, is because with the post\nmeta, you could have multiple things and\n\n158\n00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.660\nmultiple keys that have a similar name.\n\n159\n00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.480\nSo you could use this to differentiate\nbetween several fields and\n\n160\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.360\nown replace that matches\nthat previous value.\n\n161\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.540\nThere's a very specific use case, so\nit's very rare that you'll use this, but\n\n162\n00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.120\nit is that an extra way to get a specific\nvalue that you trying to replace.\n\n163\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.170\nFor us though we're not gonna do that\nbecause we don't need that right now.\n\n164\n00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.680\nSo we are going to go over here and\nlet's see.\n\n165\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.814\nI believe we should be able to put\nthis in the page load, but if not,\n\n166\n00:08:35.814 --> 00:08:41.683\nwe might have to put it into a, actually,\njust so we don't crash this site,\n\n167\n00:08:41.683 --> 00:08:46.308\nlet's go and do an add action and\nwe'll do it in admin in it.\n\n168\n00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:50.990\nAnd fc at meta.\n\n169\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.210\nThat way we don't have any fatal\nerrors like we had last time.\n\n170\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.820\nSo we're going to function fc add meta and\n\n171\n00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.070\nwe are going to put our\nstuff inside there.\n\n172\n00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.120\nLet's pretend we have some\nuseful comments there.\n\n173\n00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.080\nAnd I won't drop this inside, just so\nwe don't have any crazy errors.\n\n174\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.570\nSo we're gonna say color is set to blue.\n\n175\n00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.780\nAnd so what we're doing, normally,\nyou probably wanna do it this right\n\n176\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.520\nnow we're saying every time the page\nloads in the admin, update this color,\n\n177\n00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.850\nthat's probably not the way you're going\nto do it in the grand scheme of things,\n\n178\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.850\nbut just so we can visualize it.\n\n179\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.610\nI don't see any crazy errors, and\n\n180\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:32.200\nwe saved so,\nwe are going to come back here, upload.\n\n181\n00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.415\nI still got a crazy error,\nundefined function.\n\n182\n00:09:34.415 --> 00:09:36.249\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Is that update or\n\n183\n00:09:36.249 --> 00:09:40.941\nis that update post meta that\nshould inside of that admin handle.\n\n184\n00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:42.360\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\n\n185\n00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.990\nI misstyped as I was explaining the hook.\n\n186\n00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.020\nYou were most, very much right.\n&gt;&gt; It happens to the best of us.\n\n187\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.460\n&gt;&gt; Hey I was in the middle of explaining\n\n188\n00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.800\nand I stopped typing and-\n&gt;&gt; Nothing to be embarassed about.\n\n189\n00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.780\n&gt;&gt; So, we updated so theoretically now.\n\n190\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.490\nIt should have fired, so\nwe're going to scroll down, and\n\n191\n00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.040\nthere now it says the color is blue.\n\n192\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.300\nNow, theoretically, if you're\nrolling this into a major plugin or\n\n193\n00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.940\ncustom post types, you could add fields\nlike we did to the user profile.\n\n194\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.430\nWe added a location field at the bottom.\n\n195\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.110\nYou could add fields\nin the edit post area.\n\n196\n00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.540\nSo if we had our download and\n\n197\n00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.910\nproducts like we had before,\nwe could have added extra field there.\n\n198\n00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.630\nAnd those fields could\ncorrelate to some meta.\n\n199\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.800\nAnd then you would get it to show and\nthen update it to save.\n\n200\n00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.020\nAnd then you could display it here.\n\n201\n00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.470\nSo let me jump into the last\ncouple functions with post meta.\n\n202\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.510\nAnd we have a delete post meta.\n\n203\n00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.430\nAnd this is useful if,\n\n204\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:38.380\nfor whatever reason,\nyou need to reset a custom post tag.\n\n205\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:43.350\nOr modify some sort of a raise in values,\nyou could use this to delete the value.\n\n206\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.290\nAnd this would delete\nthe entire custom field or\n\n207\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.260\nmultiple fields if there\nhappened to be extras in there.\n\n208\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.950\nSo, in this case it's going to be,\n\n209\n00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.692\nit takes the exact same things as the\nupdate, so post_id, meta_key, meta_value.\n\n210\n00:10:54.692 --> 00:10:58.477\nThe meta_value being optional that will\njust help differentiate between multiple\n\n211\n00:10:58.477 --> 00:11:01.270\nfields like we talked\nabout in the updating.\n\n212\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.730\nSo, we can go in there and\nwe could delete the color if we needed to.\n\n213\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.600\nIn our case, we have no need to but\nthere be something that might be useful\n\n214\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.520\ndepending on how you are structuring you\ncustom post sites and your post meta.\n\n215\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.700\nNow, the last one that we do wanna\nplay with though is get post custom.\n\n216\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.510\nSo I just talked about in your custom\npost site in your downloads, or products,\n\n217\n00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.370\nor podcasts.\n\n218\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.960\nIt's very likely you might have ten\ncustom fields or ten post meta.\n\n219\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.280\nMaybe a length, a host, a color,\na change log, anything like that.\n\n220\n00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.660\nAnd maybe you have multiple things.\n\n221\n00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.430\nNow you could come over here and\ndo, where's our get?\n\n222\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.590\nOur get post meta.\n\n223\n00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.370\nYou can do this ten times,\nsort it into variables, and\n\n224\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.920\nthen add it all to the bottom\nof the content structure.\n\n225\n00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.840\nYou could, but\nthat doesn't sound like fun.\n\n226\n00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.620\nSo, what you could do, is you just get\npost custom and pass it to post id and\n\n227\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.210\nit will return you the values\nof all the custom fields.\n\n228\n00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.470\nSo let's go ahead and try that.\n\n229\n00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.740\nSo we're gonna copy that.\n\n230\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.220\nand this time I'm sure and I copy it so\n\n231\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.980\nI don't forget to add the bottom there and\nwe're gonna call this stuff.\n\n232\n00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.790\nSo 195 and\nthis should work inside the loop.\n\n233\n00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.700\nSo let's take a look.\n\n234\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.804\nLet's take a look and\nsee what we get here.\n\n235\n00:12:10.804 --> 00:12:13.381\nWhere's our percent?\n\n236\n00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:17.420\nSo we're gonna hop back over here.\n\n237\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.190\nJust in case you are not\nfamiliar with print_r,\n\n238\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:25.950\nthis is a PHP function that takes\nwhatever variable you pass it and\n\n239\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.400\nechoes it out to the page, but explains\nwhat type it is, what's inside of it.\n\n240\n00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.200\nAll those fun things.\n\n241\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.240\nSo, we're going to come over here,\nand what it show us.\n\n242\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.100\nThese are the custom fields that\nwe have inside the post right now.\n\n243\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.540\nNow, we'll find our color index here,\nand we have our blue value right there.\n\n244\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.910\nIf we add multiple values,\nit would all be within this step.\n\n245\n00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.150\nNow, you'll notice there's\nsome additional stuff.\n\n246\n00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.890\nThat's WordPress things, edit_lock,\n\n247\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.220\nedit_last You don't usually\nhave to worry about those.\n\n248\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.150\nYou're gonna find some extra\nthings depending on your site,\n\n249\n00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.280\nthe plugins and themes.\n\n250\n00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.820\nYou might have quite a bit in here but\n\n251\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.730\nknowing your values you'd be able to\ngo through here and get out your values\n\n252\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.790\nusing the one call as opposed to doing all\nthe calls over and over and over and over.\n\n253\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.440\nSo in this case, we are after the color.\n\n254\n00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.290\nNow, if you'll notice,\nthis is an array inside of an array.\n\n255\n00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.080\nSo, something to think about.\n\n256\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:14.910\nSo, we're gonna come up here.\n\n257\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.780\nWe're gonna replace this part.\n\n258\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.120\nAnd we're gonna attempt\nto replace this part.\n\n259\n00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.630\nSo if we do stuff and\nthis is color, right?\n\n260\n00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.038\nYes, stuff, color.\n\n261\n00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:28.770\nNow, right now that is an array.\n\n262\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.530\nThat's not the actual value.\n\n263\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.110\nWe come over here,\n\n264\n00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:36.190\nwe'll see there's an array and\nthe zero index has the value of blue.\n\n265\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.440\nSo, what we need to do is go into color\nand then zero to get our color out.\n\n266\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.910\nSo no,\nlet's give this the right spacing there.\n\n267\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.850\nWe're gonna come over here,\n\n268\n00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.410\nand now if we did this right,\nit should still show color blue.\n\n269\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.130\nSo if you have multiple fields or\n\n270\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.840\nmultiple post meta, that will be the more\nefficient way of getting to your data.\n\n271\n00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.860\nDoes that sort of make sense Justin?\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n272\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.520\nAnd would we use things like this,\n\n273\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.130\nare you typically using post meta to\nmodify the post just like we are here?\n\n274\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.910\nI know you made some mentions there.\n\n275\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.540\nBut what would you say the 80% use case of\n\n276\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.630\npost meta is?\n&gt;&gt; So most of it is anything you\n\n277\n00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.934\nwant to [INAUDIBLE] so\nif we had a custom post like a podcast.\n\n278\n00:14:16.934 --> 00:14:22.120\nYou have post meta of probably the host,\nmaybe the length,\n\n279\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.170\nmaybe the topics are in it.\n\n280\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.070\nMaybe a transcription if you\nhave a transcription file,\n\n281\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.280\nthings along those lines.\n\n282\n00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.210\nAnd to output it, you would do just like\nwe are with the v content filter and\n\n283\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.550\nthen outputting it somewhere.\n\n284\n00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.460\nMaybe you would output it\nunderneath the content or\n\n285\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.030\nmaybe you have some kind of\nwidget that would retrieve it.\n\n286\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.970\nThings along those lines.\n\n287\n00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.580\nTo actually update it though,\ntraditionally,\n\n288\n00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.170\ninstead of doing this wierd update in\nthe admin in it, we would add fields.\n\n289\n00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.536\nIf we go back over here.\n\n290\n00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:50.800\nAnd add the same post,\nand we'll just scroll it.\n\n291\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.220\nPretend this is a custom post or\neven just a regular post.\n\n292\n00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.320\nYou could add fields underneath it down\nhere where there's tags and categories.\n\n293\n00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.940\nWe could add our own widget,\nwhich we'll get to in a future episode.\n\n294\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.550\nWe'll have an entire thing around that,\nbut that would be the more traditional way\n\n295\n00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.100\nof usually adding this content in.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense.\n\n296\n00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.520\nI just wanted to I thought it\nwas something like that, but\n\n297\n00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.520\nI just wanted to really drive\nhome kind of those details.\n\n298\n00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.230\nNow as far as post-meta is concerned,\n\n299\n00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.870\nare there any other things that we\nneed to be aware of before kind\n\n300\n00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:22.030\nof moving on in our adventure?\n&gt;&gt; Well the big thing is trying\n\n301\n00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.480\nto figure out your structure before\nyou get a year into your site.\n\n302\n00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.210\nBecause theoretically once\nthis post-meta is in,\n\n303\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.090\nthese are sorted into different arrays\nlike we saw, and different values.\n\n304\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:30.730\nSo if you get to a point,\n\n305\n00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.320\nyou're like \"wow, I really want to\nrestructure it this way\" you'd have to end\n\n306\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.440\nup building a massive migration script.\n\n307\n00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.130\nWhich, if you've ever played with any\nof those, it's not going to be fun,\n\n308\n00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.270\nit's not always going to work.\n\n309\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.120\nSo mapping out your structures\nwhen you first get started,\n\n310\n00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.310\nand what's going to go into post meta,\nwhat's going to go into user meta,\n\n311\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.700\nwhere are we going to use this so\nwe know how to structure this.\n\n312\n00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.020\nSomebody's post meta,\nwe can store into an array.\n\n313\n00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.600\nSo, for example there's\na popular pop-up plug-in and\n\n314\n00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.920\nthey have custom size pop-up and\nthey have a hundred settings.\n\n315\n00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.495\nAnd similar settings are multiple\nsettings that are stored into\n\n316\n00:15:58.495 --> 00:16:01.790\ncustomed size post meta as arrays.\n\n317\n00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.440\nNow, there is mark down array then maybe\nsix months from now they would add\n\n318\n00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.160\nnew features.\n\n319\n00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.183\nAnd they're gonna have to create massive\nmigration script to rearrange all these\n\n320\n00:16:09.183 --> 00:16:10.610\ndifferent settings.\n\n321\n00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.053\nSo mapping everything out and\n\n322\n00:16:12.053 --> 00:16:16.101\nunderstanding the structure of what you're\naiming to do is a very important step.\n\n323\n00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:19.096\nCuz like I said, this could not\nonly be just location or session,\n\n324\n00:16:19.096 --> 00:16:22.810\nit could be entire settings for\nsome sort of post site you're creating.\n\n325\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.790\nSo mapping it out first is\nprobably a very big first step.\n\n326\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, there you have it,\n\n327\n00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.930\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n328\n00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:33.420\nWe have now started to see how we can use\nmetadata to do all kinds of fun stuff and\n\n329\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.300\nI can see how this is gonna\ncome up as we start to\n\n330\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.120\ncreate our own custom possible themes,\nor plugins, or the source.\n\n331\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.690\nSo, definitely stay tuned.\n\n332\n00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.210\nWe got some of that coming at you.\n\n333\n00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.710\nBut for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n334\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.647\nSo, signing off for DevPro.TV,\nI been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n335\n00:16:47.647 --> 00:16:48.566\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Frank Corso.\n\n336\n00:16:48.566 --> 00:16:50.366\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n337\n00:16:50.366 -->
