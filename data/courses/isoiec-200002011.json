Francisco\n\n3\n00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.354\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:11.931\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ISO/IEC\n\n5\n00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:18.900\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.050\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.400\nIn this episode, we have ISO\nexpert Jo Peacock to come in and\n\n8\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.840\nintroduce what the series\nis really all about.\n\n9\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.060\nSo, thank you for joining us today, Jo.\n\n10\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.000\nHow are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm doing fine, but\nI want to help you out right now, okay?\n\n12\n00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.150\nBecause that's quite a bit of a mouthful,\nisn't it?\n\n13\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.000\n&gt;&gt; It was a mouthful.\n\n14\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, ISO, ICE.\n\n15\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.110\n20000 2011, yeah let's call it ISO 20k,\nhow about that?\n\n16\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n17\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.770\n&gt;&gt; Even ISO 20000.\n\n18\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.670\nWe should really technically\nuse the right terminology for\n\n19\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.500\nthis because it is an international\nstandard so it's the, it's for\n\n20\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.840\nthe, from the international\norganization for standardization.\n\n21\n00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.010\nBut however we're just\ngonna call it ISO 20000.\n\n22\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean this is\na technical show anyways, so\n\n23\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.820\nlet's be technical at least once per show.\n\n24\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.630\nHow about that?\n\n25\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.580\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nwe should do that once per show.\n\n26\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.910\nBut nevertheless-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.790\n&gt;&gt; We know that this is a lot for\n\n28\n00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.290\neverybody to get their mouths around.\n\n29\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.330\nAnd for those of you that\nare trying to achieve ISO 20000,\n\n30\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.440\nthen you're gonna be calling it ISO 20000.\n\n31\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.540\nYou're certainly not gonna be banding\nthat around the office all the time.\n\n32\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.405\n&gt;&gt; We have enough to think about, right?\n\n33\n00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:29.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah,\nI'm doing fine anyway, how are you?\n\n34\n00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.300\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\n\n35\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.290\nSo who are we really focusing this\ntraining for, or these shows for?\n\n36\n00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.730\nWho should be interested in\nwatching these shows, Jo?\n\n37\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.270\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing that I want to do\nis just explain a little bit about what\n\n38\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.159\nISO 20,000 is.\n\n39\n00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then in this particular episode,\n\n40\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.070\nI'm just going to give us just\ngeneral overview of who should\n\n41\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.050\nactually be interested in this show and\nwho should sort of sit and\n\n42\n00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.880\nwatch some of the episodes in this show.\n\n43\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.840\nOkay?\n\n44\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.500\nSo the first thing that I wanna do\nas I've said is just to highlight\n\n45\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.341\nwhat ISO 20,000 is.\n\n46\n00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:06.520\nISO 20,000 is\nthe international standard for\n\n47\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.340\nIT service management,\nall right what does that mean and\n\n48\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.430\nhow does it differ from ITIL\nbecause we've got shows about ITIL.\n\n49\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.160\nAnd of course there's been a lot of\n\n50\n00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.340\ntalk about ITIL around the world\nin the past few years.\n\n51\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.980\nWell ITIL is just a framework\nit is a framework for\n\n52\n00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.842\nmanaging IT services and\nit's at best practice frame work.\n\n53\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.990\nBut there is no audit for ITIL.\n\n54\n00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.860\nThere's nobody that can come in and tell\nyou whether you're doing ITIL right or\n\n55\n00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.820\nwrong because ITIL is a framework that\nyou bring into your organization.\n\n56\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.400\nYou adopt the framework.\n\n57\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.570\nBut then you adapt it in a way\nthat makes common sense,\n\n58\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.190\nperfect sense for your organization.\n\n59\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.520\nSo you adapt it for efficiency and for\neffectiveness in your organization.\n\n60\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.010\nITIL is not plug and play.\n\n61\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.080\nITIL is not a one-size-fits-all approach\nthat will solve all of the world's\n\n62\n00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.650\nproblems.\n\n63\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.960\nCommon misconception there.\n\n64\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.745\nYou know,\nITIL's gonna do everything right.\n\n65\n00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:09.140\n[LAUGH] Well, ITIL doesn't do that.\n\n66\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.250\nITIL is, as I said, just the framework.\n\n67\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.010\nWe won't tell you what your\nprocesses will look like.\n\n68\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.630\nWe'll tell you that you\nneed to have a process.\n\n69\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.590\nAnd we'll tell you how to in I-Tel,\nhow to define a process as well.\n\n70\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.940\nSo we'll tell you that you need to have\na process for restoring service operation.\n\n71\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.930\nIn other words, for getting people back up\nand running when something's gone wrong.\n\n72\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.770\nAnd in I-Tel In ITIL mind we\ncall this incident management.\n\n73\n00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.380\nAnd so\nwe'll tell you that you need to work out\n\n74\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.260\nwhat incident management looks like for\nyour organization.\n\n75\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.515\nSo you will need to have\na process to restore service.\n\n76\n00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:51.635\nWhen it goes wrong,\nto get it back up and running again.\n\n77\n00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:55.955\nAnd so what ITIL does is ITIL says to\nyou okay, you need to have this process.\n\n78\n00:03:55.955 --> 00:04:01.355\nHere's some,\nI was gonna say hints and tips.\n\n79\n00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:05.545\nHere's some very useful information that's\ngoing to help you define a process.\n\n80\n00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.220\nWill tell you that you start by working\nat what your process should do.\n\n81\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.640\nWork at its objective and\nthen work out the output from the process.\n\n82\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.980\nSo what should the output\nfrom a process look like?\n\n83\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.560\nThen what about the inputs?\n\n84\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.740\nThe various inputs to a process.\n\n85\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.640\nAnd then, okay, what steps do you need\nin your organization to ensure that\n\n86\n00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.580\nwe get from the inputs to the outputs.\n\n87\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.145\nAnd this is what ITIL will tell you.\n\n88\n00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:35.770\nITIL will tell you not only what\nprocesses you should have, but\n\n89\n00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.770\nalso how to define those processes.\n\n90\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.250\nBut we won't tell you what your\nprocesses look like, not in ITIL.\n\n91\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.790\nSo there can't be an audit for ITIL.\n\n92\n00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.775\nNobody can come along, even me.\n\n93\n00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:48.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n94\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.640\nI like to think of myself as fairly\nknowledgeable on the subject.\n\n95\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.460\nSo I can't come along and say,\nyes, that's working great for\n\n96\n00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.950\nyour organization using the checklist.\n\n97\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.160\nI can't do that.\n\n98\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.694\nI can't audit you from here.\n\n99\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.160\nThere is no iTel compliance.\n\n100\n00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.070\nAnd this is something that's a common\nmisconception amongst everybody that tries\n\n101\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.490\nto implement ITIL,\nis that you can be ITIL compliant.\n\n102\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.490\nAnd you can't be ITIL compliant,\ncuz there's no right or wrong with ITIL.\n\n103\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.130\nSo, The question that I ask is though,\n\n104\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.730\nwhat's the difference between ITIL and\nISO 20000.\n\n105\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.350\nWell, that's what ITIL is.\n\n106\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.400\nITIL's a framework for managing services,\n\n107\n00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.155\nit's the best practice framework that\nyou adapt to sync your organization.\n\n108\n00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:40.235\nSo how do you know if\nit's working okay then?\n\n109\n00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:43.025\nHow do you know if ITIL is working great?\n\n110\n00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:45.915\nWell when we have something\nthat's completely independent,\n\n111\n00:05:45.915 --> 00:05:47.545\ncompletely separate.\n\n112\n00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:49.665\nHas absolutely nothing to do with ITIL.\n\n113\n00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:53.775\nI say that with a wink all right.\n\n114\n00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:57.270\nHas absolutely nothing to\ndo with ITIL whatsoever.\n\n115\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.030\nWe have an international standard for\nservice management,\n\n116\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.900\nfor IT service management.\n\n117\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.010\nAnd with any international standard,\n\n118\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.765\nan international standard is\nsomething that you attain.\n\n119\n00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:11.879\nIt's something that you achieve,\n\n120\n00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.987\nit's something that you can\nsay that you can comply with.\n\n121\n00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:21.740\nISO 20,000 is a standard,\n\n122\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.240\nwhere you can measure yourself against and\nit's a standard for\n\n123\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.950\ndemonstrating efficiency and\neffectiveness and\n\n124\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:40.170\nthe relationships in place between\nIT service management processes.\n\n125\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.370\nSo, it's a standard for demonstrating\n\n126\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.550\nthat you are able to\nmanage your IT services\n\n127\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.259\nin a way that is the most efficient and\neffective for your organization.\n\n128\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.600\nSo it's a standard where\nyou are audited against\n\n129\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.800\nyour processes and your services,\nto ensure that your processes and\n\n130\n00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.530\nservices are delivering\nvalue to your organization,\n\n131\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.170\nthat you have the right processes\nin place in order to achieve this.\n\n132\n00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.260\nBut also, and when I say achieve this\nI mean achieve value delivery, but\n\n133\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.510\nalso that those processes work\nefficiently and effectively.\n\n134\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.840\nThat they're not bound down by\nbureaucracy, that they're actually\n\n135\n00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.760\nworking in a way that will deliver\nthe most value to your organization.\n\n136\n00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.280\nSo ISO 20000 does not audit ITIL.\n\n137\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.280\nThis is not an ITIL audit.\n\n138\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.990\nITIL is just a best practice framework,\nand there are lots of other frameworks.\n\n139\n00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.440\nEven proprietary frameworks\nthat are out there.\n\n140\n00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.378\nThere are a lot of organizations\nthat have created proprietary\n\n141\n00:07:54.378 --> 00:07:56.527\nframeworks for instance.\n\n142\n00:07:56.527 --> 00:07:57.385\nAnd of course,\n\n143\n00:07:57.385 --> 00:08:01.610\nwhat you evolve in your organization\nbecomes your proprietary framework.\n\n144\n00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.690\nNow your proprietary management\nframework will achieve ISO 20000,\n\n145\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.700\nas long as it is efficient and\n\n146\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:15.210\nit is effective in the processes and\nthe way that IT is managed.\n\n147\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.050\nSo there is a big\ndifference between the two.\n\n148\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:26.200\nISO 20000 is a standard for\nthe management of services.\n\n149\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.700\nNow, if you have implemented ITIL in\na way that is the best practice for\n\n150\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.539\nyour organization, then that will\nhelp you to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n151\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.391\nI am not gonna tell you that\nif you got ITIL implemented,\n\n152\n00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:44.130\nthen you're definitely\ngoing to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n153\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.898\nCuz that's not the case.\n\n154\n00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:51.030\nCuz if you've got an ITIL framework\nimplemented in your organization.\n\n155\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:56.820\nThen unless you have modified and\nadapted that ITIL framework in a way that\n\n156\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.530\nis the most efficient for you, then you're\nnot going to achieve ISO 20000 at all.\n\n157\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.760\nYou will only achieve ISO 20000 if\nyou can meet all of the requirements\n\n158\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.960\nthat are outlined in the ISO 20000,\nwe call them parts.\n\n159\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.080\nSo these are the requirements\nof ISO 20000.\n\n160\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.350\nSo ISO 20000, as I've said,\nis something that you achieve.\n\n161\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.830\nAnd it is something that you will have\nan auditor come to your organization.\n\n162\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.630\nAnd this is after you've had a lot of\ntime to prepare for this, by the way.\n\n163\n00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:40.350\nAnd an auditor will look at your\nprocesses and look at your environment.\n\n164\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.320\nAnd look at the tools and\nthe management that you have in place, and\n\n165\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.720\nthe way that you work.\n\n166\n00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.070\nAnd we'll assess whether you\nhave achieved all of the clauses\n\n167\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.650\nwithin the ISO 20000 requirement.\n\n168\n00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.500\nSo ISO 20000, as I've said,\nis not dependent on ITIL at all.\n\n169\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.720\nHowever, if you have an ITIL based\nframework in place, and it's working\n\n170\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.840\nefficiently and effectively, then it will\ncertainly help you to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n171\n00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.702\nCherokee, you have a question.\n\n172\n00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:16.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Jo, I know you've taught some\npretty high level courses here ITProTV.\n\n173\n00:10:16.745 --> 00:10:18.807\nAnd just looking at the title for\nthis one,\n\n174\n00:10:18.807 --> 00:10:21.570\nyou're talking about the auditing process.\n\n175\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.666\nNow this course that\nwe're about to get into,\n\n176\n00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:26.427\nthis isn't one that will prepare\nus to be auditors, per se.\n\n177\n00:10:26.427 --> 00:10:30.147\nBut looking at the foundations, we want to\nget a good understanding in order to be\n\n178\n00:10:30.147 --> 00:10:33.145\nable to facilitate this implementation,\ncorrect?\n\n179\n00:10:33.145 --> 00:10:37.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what this course will do\nis this course will prepare you for.\n\n180\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.530\n&gt;&gt; It will tell you all about\nthe requirements for an ISO 20000 audit,\n\n181\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.555\nas it were.\n\n182\n00:10:41.555 --> 00:10:42.880\nOkay.\n\n183\n00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.280\nSo we use this course.\n\n184\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.790\nAnd in fact, on this particular slide\nthat we've got in front of us now.\n\n185\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.170\nWe use this course,\njust take a look at the target audience.\n\n186\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:56.636\nWe would use this course to prepare\npeople for an audit for ISO 20000.\n\n187\n00:10:56.636 --> 00:10:59.940\nPerfect.\nA lot of organizations will implement\n\n188\n00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.440\nan ITIL based framework.\n\n189\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.240\nAnd I won't say ITIL based framework,\ncuz you never implement ITIL.\n\n190\n00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.380\nYou always implement ITIL based.\n\n191\n00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.990\nAnd so what will happen is, organizations\nget to a point where they perceive\n\n192\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.650\nthat they have implemented this framework,\nand that it's working, great.\n\n193\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.100\nAnd that they are working efficiently and\neffectively.\n\n194\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.930\nAnd so what do we do now, then?\n\n195\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.320\nWe can't demonstrate ITIL compliance.\n\n196\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.080\nSo what do we do?\n\n197\n00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.730\nWe wanna have that certificate,\nwe wanna have that plaque on the wall.\n\n198\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.282\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we wanna get some kind of.\n\n199\n00:11:28.282 --> 00:11:29.340\nRecognition.\nRecognition for\n\n200\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.290\nour hard work that we've\nput into everything.\n\n201\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.870\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\nwhy the target audience for this is for\n\n202\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.210\nthose organizations that are saying,\nokay, I wanna get some recognition now.\n\n203\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.720\nHow do I do this?\n\n204\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.850\nAnd so it's at this point in time where an\norganization might look for recognition,\n\n205\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.850\nand the first place that they will come\nto is the international standards.\n\n206\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.690\nAnd your international standard,\nyour ISO 20000, will actually give them\n\n207\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.550\nrecognition for having a service\nmanagement framework in place.\n\n208\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.160\nNot necessarily ITIL.\n\n209\n00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.900\nBut it's a management framework that\n\n210\n00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.610\nwill promote the delivery of\nvalue to the business, itself.\n\n211\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.260\nSo the target audience for\n\n212\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.270\nthis are all those people who are going\nto be involved in an ISO 20000 audit.\n\n213\n00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.330\nSo all of those people that\nare preparing for an ISO 20000 audit.\n\n214\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.350\nThese are all of those people that\nare gonna be involved in the actual\n\n215\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.980\naudit process.\n\n216\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.890\nAnd all of those people within IT.\n\n217\n00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.660\nAnd it says here in that second\nbullet point down underneath it,\n\n218\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.650\nthe target audience.\n\n219\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.790\nIt says managers,\nteam leaders, and other staff.\n\n220\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.675\n&gt;&gt; Right, because I don't think it's\njust isolated to the IT department.\n\n221\n00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.790\nThose other stakeholders should\nat least understand what\n\n222\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.530\nthey're approaching before the audit,\nright?\n\n223\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.090\n&gt;&gt; The biggest misconception for\n\n224\n00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:51.050\nISO 20000 is that we're just going to let\nall the managers know what's going on.\n\n225\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.480\nAnd as far as letting everybody else know,\nthey don't need to be involved.\n\n226\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.720\nBut that's not the case.\n\n227\n00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.800\nIf I'm conducting an ISO 20000 audit,\nthen,\n\n228\n00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.222\nI may come up to you,\nno matter who you are.\n\n229\n00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:03.900\nI may come up to you,\n\n230\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.318\nand I may say to you, could you show me\nwhere your security policy is, please?\n\n231\n00:13:08.318 --> 00:13:09.088\nSure Jo.\n\n232\n00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.070\n[LAUGH] Right, now.\n\n233\n00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.685\nOr like, I don't know what that is.\n\n234\n00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:15.800\nRight, exactly.\n\n235\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.210\nAnd this is the problems that we have.\n\n236\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.100\nAs auditors, you could ask that sort\nof question of absolutely everybody.\n\n237\n00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.940\nNow, if you're not able to answer that,\n\n238\n00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.500\nthen obviously, that's going to be\na problem for you in the audit.\n\n239\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.250\nSo this is not just a case of\nthe management being involved.\n\n240\n00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.110\nThat target audience\nspecifically says other stuff.\n\n241\n00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.860\nNow in that first bullet point for\nthe target audience,\n\n242\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.880\nwe talk about managers,\nservice owners, and process owners.\n\n243\n00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.840\nBecause these are the people that\nhave to drive the compliance.\n\n244\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.270\nThey have to drive all of the activities\nthat will get them to this compliance.\n\n245\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.150\nBut nevertheless,\neverybody needs to be aware.\n\n246\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.340\nAnd we mentioned internal auditors.\n\n247\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.420\nAnd we'll always tell you before you\nactually have your official ITIL audit,\n\n248\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.650\nyou should be auditing yourselves.\n\n249\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.000\nYou can get hold of.\n\n250\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.660\nAnd as you start moving down this path,\n\n251\n00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.160\nyou will be able to get hold of the check\nlist, etc., that auditors are looking for.\n\n252\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.045\nThat they're checking against,\nthey're auditing against.\n\n253\n00:14:20.045 --> 00:14:25.640\nThen you will be able to see exactly\nwhere you are on achievement.\n\n254\n00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.170\nAnd so we expect internal auditors\nto be completely involved in this.\n\n255\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.770\nNow, whether you want to\nput your internal staff,\n\n256\n00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.810\nsome of your internal staff on\nan ISO 20000 auditor course.\n\n257\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.800\nThen that's something that we\nwould recommend that you do.\n\n258\n00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.876\nBecause obviously, for those organizations\nthat are looking to implement ISO 20000.\n\n259\n00:14:45.876 --> 00:14:48.660\nRight.\nOr are looking to achieve ISO 20000, then.\n\n260\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Setting yourself up for\nsuccess, basically.\n\n261\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.105\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\ndon't set yourself up for failure.\n\n262\n00:14:54.105 --> 00:14:55.646\nRight.\nNow one of the things that,\n\n263\n00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:58.379\nif you notice here,\nwe've got prerequisites here.\n\n264\n00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:02.070\nAnd prerequisites are that\nyou need to have at\n\n265\n00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.170\nleast two years worth of IT service\nmanagement experience, it says.\n\n266\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.340\nOr hold the ITIL Foundation Certificate.\n\n267\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.990\nPersonally, I would recommend both.\n\n268\n00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; There are a lot of\n\n269\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.890\npeople that will come into IT.\n\n270\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.200\nAnd one of the first things that they do.\n\n271\n00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.240\nAnd, in fact, university students\nnow who gain sort of master's,\n\n272\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.430\netc., within IT, itself.\n\n273\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.930\nOr within a particular\ntopic within technology.\n\n274\n00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.480\n&gt;&gt; Computer science, yeah.\n\n275\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, computer science, etc.\n\n276\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.640\nThey come into the IT world and\ninto our environment.\n\n277\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:42.240\nAnd the first thing that they do is that\nthey either take an ITIL foundation class,\n\n278\n00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.060\nor they are put on an ITIL foundation\nclass by their organization.\n\n279\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.160\nWe would say that you need to have some\nexperience to go with this, as well.\n\n280\n00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.440\nWe're talking about an audit.\n\n281\n00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.796\nWe're talking about\nan international standard.\n\n282\n00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:57.212\nSo we're talking about not just\nan in-depth knowledge of IT and\n\n283\n00:15:57.212 --> 00:15:58.740\nan in-depth knowledge of.\n\n284\n00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:05.240\nSo Unix, or\nwhatever spectrum you work within.\n\n285\n00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.960\nBut we're also talking about\n\n286\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.880\nhaving an understanding of\nthe IT environment as a whole.\n\n287\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.810\n&gt;&gt; Right, and business practices.\n\n288\n00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes students don't have that,\n\n289\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.850\nper se, when they're entering.\n\n290\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.820\nSo that's great that we are able to\nactually provide this kind of training.\n\n291\n00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\nSo\n\n292\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.280\nthis is not just a case of\ngetting the qualifications.\n\n293\n00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.288\nYou've really gotta understand,\ncertainly with ISO 20000, you've\n\n294\n00:16:30.288 --> 00:16:35.604\ngotta understand the environment before\nyou can work towards any achievements,\n\n295\n00:16:35.604 --> 00:16:40.318\nand any sort of checking the boxes\nthat work for any audit requirements.\n\n296\n00:16:40.318 --> 00:16:43.896\nSo I would definitely say that you should\nhave at least two years worth of IT\n\n297\n00:16:43.896 --> 00:16:46.010\nservice management experience.\n\n298\n00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.160\nHowever, that said,\nwhen you are a new student and\n\n299\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.370\nyou're coming into an organization that's\nin the middle of trying to achieve\n\n300\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.820\nISO 20000 compliance, then in that case,\neverybody needs to be made aware.\n\n301\n00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.430\nAnd so there's definitely should be\nsome case of, or some instance of,\n\n302\n00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.930\noverviews that are happening\nwith everyone that's involved\n\n303\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.469\nin IT when we're trying\nto achieve ISO 20000.\n\n304\n00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.640\nSo that's a little bit about ISO 20000,\nso what about this class itself?\n\n305\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.470\nWell this class is\nthe introduction into ISO 20000,\n\n306\n00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.050\nthis is not the auditor's class.\n\n307\n00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.600\nThis is actually the class that we\nwould give to absolutely everybody\n\n308\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.540\nthat is involved within IT.\n\n309\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.743\nWho, in an IT organization\nwhere they are looking to\n\n310\n00:17:34.743 --> 00:17:39.040\nachieve an ISO 20,000\ncompliant certificate.\n\n311\n00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.680\nSo this is a class,\nthis is a general 3-day class,\n\n312\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.760\nwith a test a the end of it\nthat we will give to, as I say,\n\n313\n00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:52.570\nabsolutely everybody that is involved\nin the ISO 20000 audit process.\n\n314\n00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.180\nSo what is the class made up of then?\n\n315\n00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.195\nWell, the class is made up of, and\nhere's just a very quick break down.\n\n316\n00:17:59.195 --> 00:18:03.166\n20% of looking at the scope of ISO 20000.\n\n317\n00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:07.870\n10% talking about the service\nmanagement system.\n\n318\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.260\nWe're also going to be talking about\nservice management processes, and\n\n319\n00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.070\nI will add a caveat in when we talk\nabout service management processes.\n\n320\n00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.680\nThis is not an ITIL class, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.750\nThis is not an ITIL show.\n\n322\n00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.088\nThis is ISO 20000, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:23.088 --> 00:18:28.790\nThis is where we audit against a standard.\n\n324\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.100\nYou might hear some terminology that you\nmight think to yourself, hang on a minute,\n\n325\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.240\nthat sounds a little bit like ITIL.\n\n326\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.100\nThis is not ITIL.\n\n327\n00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.180\nThis is an international standard.\n\n328\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.680\nWe also look at achieving certification.\n\n329\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.740\nWe also look at continual improvement\nwithin your organization.\n\n330\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.490\nAnd then we will look at\nthe audit activities and\n\n331\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.870\nwe will also do assessments.\n\n332\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:58.210\nAnd you will have exercises in your\ndownloadable material to actually\n\n333\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:03.570\nperform your own self-assessment exercises\ntoo, to test your own knowledge.\n\n334\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.410\nNow you do have an exam ,and\nthat exam is available to you.\n\n335\n00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:14.560\nAnd of course, all of your information\nwill be held in the last episode\n\n336\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.170\nof this particular class,\nwhere we'll go over the exam for you.\n\n337\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.050\nIt's a one-hour test.\n\n338\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.400\nIt's 40 questions.\n\n339\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.769\nYou have to get 26 out of 40, or\n65%, in order to pass the test.\n\n340\n00:19:24.769 --> 00:19:27.965\nNow, people will tell me, and they do,\n\n341\n00:19:27.965 --> 00:19:32.880\nthat that sounds very much\nlike an ITIL Foundation test.\n\n342\n00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.740\nYou know, 40 questions, you've got to\nget 26 out of 40 in order to pass.\n\n343\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.580\nIt does sound like an ITIL Foundation\ntest, you're right.\n\n344\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.910\nHowever, and this is where, again,\nanother one of my caveats some in.\n\n345\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.770\nIf you take your ITIL Foundation\nknowledge into an ISO 20000 test,\n\n346\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:57.790\nthere is a good chance that\nyou will trip yourself up.\n\n347\n00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.580\nBecause whilst the concept remains\nthe same, the terminology might not.\n\n348\n00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.990\nSo there are some things that\nare going to be tested on\n\n349\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.580\nthis particular class that might\nbe from certainly a different\n\n350\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.754\nperspective to that which is\ntested in ITIL Foundation.\n\n351\n00:20:17.754 --> 00:20:22.588\nSo this is a very,\nvery clear warning to you to\n\n352\n00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:26.800\nnot confuse ITIL with ISO 20000.\n\n353\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.780\nITIL is a best practice framework.\n\n354\n00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:36.100\nAnd having an ITIL-based framework\nimplemented will help you to achieve\n\n355\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:41.140\nISO 20000, but it's not a guarantee.\n\n356\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.470\nAnd here in ISO 20000, in this\nparticular show, and in these episodes,\n\n357\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:51.600\nwe are going to be concentrating on\nthe actual international standard itself,\n\n358\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:57.260\nand certification for\nthe international standard.\n\n359\n00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Jo,\njust to break it down a little bit for\n\n360\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.780\nthat name, because I thought this was\nkind of interesting for me anyways.\n\n361\n00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:08.280\nIt might not be to you, but with the ISO\ncoming from the Greek word isos, meaning\n\n362\n00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.590\nequal, because it's really international\nhere, we have to keep that in mind.\n\n363\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.540\nIt's not tied to any\none particular country.\n\n364\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:21.970\nAnd then also looking at that last part,\nthe 20011, which is referencing that\n\n365\n00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.640\nversion, this iteration of this\nparticular, I guess, what is it?\n\n366\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.390\nExam, or that particular standard.\n\n367\n00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.164\nBecause when I worked in\nthe manufacturing facility,\n\n368\n00:21:32.164 --> 00:21:35.916\nyes there was ISO compliance, but\nit was really geared toward a product.\n\n369\n00:21:35.916 --> 00:21:40.208\nBut this is really cool because we're\ntalking about being compliant or\n\n370\n00:21:40.208 --> 00:21:43.714\nobtaining that certification,\nor that compliance, for\n\n371\n00:21:43.714 --> 00:21:47.955\nnot necessarily a product, but\nwe're talking about the IT service.\n\n372\n00:21:47.955 --> 00:21:49.695\nSo that's really neat.\n\n373\n00:21:49.695 --> 00:21:53.520\n&gt;&gt; ISO 20000 is quite unique\nin as much as, in terms of IT,\n\n374\n00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.480\nit's really, really difficult to obtain\nan international standard for IT.\n\n375\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.780\nBecause every single service for\nevery organization is different.\n\n376\n00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.580\nAnd every single service is used\nin a completely different way,\n\n377\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.500\nbecause the organization has\na completely different purpose as well.\n\n378\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it is, in one respect,\n\n379\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.380\nit's quite a prestigious\naccreditation to achieve.\n\n380\n00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.620\nBecause it's quite a difficult\none to demonstrate.\n\n381\n00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.670\nWhich is why I say, in one respect,\nit's quite difficult.\n\n382\n00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:30.170\nNow, if you are fully\nconversant with ITIL, and\n\n383\n00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.810\nif you've got an ITIL-based\nframework in place.\n\n384\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.180\nAnd you have been working in a way\nthat is efficient and effective,\n\n385\n00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.830\nthen really what we're asking you to\ndo is, we're asking you to prove it.\n\n386\n00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.940\nAnd I like to use the word,\n\n387\n00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.970\nshow me, because that's exactly\nwhat we're doing here in ISO 20000.\n\n388\n00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.900\nThis is where we come along and\nwe say, show me.\n\n389\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.170\nShow me that it's working,\nshow me that it's efficient.\n\n390\n00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.190\nThis is about the proof.\n\n391\n00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.580\nBut it's very prestigious to have\nthe ISO 20000 certification.\n\n392\n00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:05.230\nAnd it's true that a lot of organizations\nwill put a lot of effort and\n\n393\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.500\na lot of investment into achieving\nthis international standard.\n\n394\n00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:13.280\nNow, the international standard\nis updated on a regular basis.\n\n395\n00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.360\nIt was first implemented in 2005.\n\n396\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.600\nAnd as you say, it was updated in 2011,\n\n397\n00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.330\nand we will be looking to\nupdate the standard again.\n\n398\n00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.290\nAnd I know that I have colleagues that\nare working on this right now as we speak,\n\n399\n00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:31.050\nlooking to update the standard\nagain n the near future,\n\n400\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.300\nbecause we like to make\nsure that it's current.\n\n401\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.440\nAnd certainly when we're talking about IT,\nand IT services,\n\n402\n00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.270\nthe IT environment changes very,\nvery rapidly.\n\n403\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.645\nSo ISO 20000 is something\nthat is here to stay.\n\n404\n00:23:44.645 --> 00:23:49.380\nIt is something that certainly\nis very prestigious.\n\n405\n00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.510\nBut it's also something that a lot\nof organizations will use the ISO\n\n406\n00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:59.466\n20000 audit as an internal measure,\njust for themselves.\n\n407\n00:23:59.466 --> 00:24:03.708\nNot to try and achieve any accreditation,\nbut just as an internal measure as to how\n\n408\n00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:06.890\nefficient and\nhow effective their IT processes are.\n\n409\n00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.730\nAnd we would certainly encourage that,\nand that's one of the reasons why\n\n410\n00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.840\nwe want to make this class\navailable to everybody here today.\n\n411\n00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.870\nIs because there are organizations\nout there that simply want to measure\n\n412\n00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:26.380\nhow effective and how efficient\ntheir IT service provision is,\n\n413\n00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.140\nand they have no way of measuring that.\n\n414\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.830\nAnd this can be available\nto your organization\n\n415\n00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.270\non an individual basis for\nyou just to measure against,\n\n416\n00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:42.460\nwithout going through the formal\nprocess of actual auditing itself.\n\n417\n00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:48.610\nAnd so in ways like we use methodologies\nlike CMMI to measure process maturity,\n\n418\n00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:52.740\nthis takes this one step further\nbecause process maturity is\n\n419\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.470\nsomething that we look at in isolation.\n\n420\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.120\nAnd we look at each process in isolation.\n\n421\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.150\nHere, with ISO 20000, we're not\nlooking at processes in isolation.\n\n422\n00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:06.230\nWe're looking at IT as a whole, and we're\nlooking to see how it hangs together,\n\n423\n00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.980\nhow it gels together, what\nthe relationships are between processes.\n\n424\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.800\nIf you don't have any relationships\nbetween your processes,\n\n425\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.830\nyou're not going to achieve\nISO 20000 compliance.\n\n426\n00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:22.400\nSo this can be used internally within your\norganization, just as a yardstick, just\n\n427\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.600\nto see really how efficient and effective\nyou are at managing your services.\n\n428\n00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's pretty cool, Jo.\n\n429\n00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:33.107\nI mean, not only are our companies and\norganizations, like you said, using it as\n\n430\n00:25:33.107 --> 00:25:37.444\nan investment for brand reputation or\ninternal-type auditing purposes.\n\n431\n00:25:37.444 --> 00:25:40.508\nBut you guys are here,\nalso investing in yourself.\n\n432\n00:25:40.508 --> 00:25:45.765\nSo I'm pretty excited, if I could\neven speak, to get this show started.\n\n433\n00:25:45.765 --> 00:25:48.925\nSo is there anything else we need to think\nof before we go ahead and close out?\n\n434\n00:25:48.925 --> 00:25:52.371\n&gt;&gt; No, in our next session,\nthen we're really going to start and\n\n435\n00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:55.115\ngett into sort of the meat\nbehind ISO 20000.\n\n436\n00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:59.330\nAnd we're going to look in a lot more\ndepth at about what the requirements are.\n\n437\n00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.360\nAnd we're gonna start\ntalking about terminology,\n\n438\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.250\nand we'll start talking about clauses,\nand part one, part two, right away.\n\n439\n00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we get to part 11 and, yeah.\n\n440\n00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:09.208\n&gt;&gt; You say it like it's a bad thing, but\n\n441\n00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:12.315\nthere's a lot of really great information\nthat we're gonna be covering, guys.\n\n442\n00:26:12.315 --> 00:26:14.510\nSo just be prepared for that.\n\n443\n00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.280\nBut I think-\n&gt;&gt; Tune in.\n\n444\n00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.940\n&gt;&gt; I think that's about it for\nthis show so we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n445\n00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.340\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n446\n00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n447\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.620\n&gt;&gt; See you here next time here at ITProTV.\n\n448\n00:26:22.620 -->
