Francisco\n\n3\n00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.354\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:11.931\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ISO/IEC\n\n5\n00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:18.900\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.050\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.400\nIn this episode, we have ISO\nexpert Jo Peacock to come in and\n\n8\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.840\nintroduce what the series\nis really all about.\n\n9\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.060\nSo, thank you for joining us today, Jo.\n\n10\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.000\nHow are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm doing fine, but\nI want to help you out right now, okay?\n\n12\n00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.150\nBecause that's quite a bit of a mouthful,\nisn't it?\n\n13\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.000\n&gt;&gt; It was a mouthful.\n\n14\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, ISO, ICE.\n\n15\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.110\n20000 2011, yeah let's call it ISO 20k,\nhow about that?\n\n16\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n17\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.770\n&gt;&gt; Even ISO 20000.\n\n18\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.670\nWe should really technically\nuse the right terminology for\n\n19\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.500\nthis because it is an international\nstandard so it's the, it's for\n\n20\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.840\nthe, from the international\norganization for standardization.\n\n21\n00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.010\nBut however we're just\ngonna call it ISO 20000.\n\n22\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean this is\na technical show anyways, so\n\n23\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.820\nlet's be technical at least once per show.\n\n24\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.630\nHow about that?\n\n25\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.580\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nwe should do that once per show.\n\n26\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.910\nBut nevertheless-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.790\n&gt;&gt; We know that this is a lot for\n\n28\n00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.290\neverybody to get their mouths around.\n\n29\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.330\nAnd for those of you that\nare trying to achieve ISO 20000,\n\n30\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.440\nthen you're gonna be calling it ISO 20000.\n\n31\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.540\nYou're certainly not gonna be banding\nthat around the office all the time.\n\n32\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.405\n&gt;&gt; We have enough to think about, right?\n\n33\n00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:29.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah,\nI'm doing fine anyway, how are you?\n\n34\n00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.300\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\n\n35\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.290\nSo who are we really focusing this\ntraining for, or these shows for?\n\n36\n00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.730\nWho should be interested in\nwatching these shows, Jo?\n\n37\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.270\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing that I want to do\nis just explain a little bit about what\n\n38\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.159\nISO 20,000 is.\n\n39\n00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then in this particular episode,\n\n40\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.070\nI'm just going to give us just\ngeneral overview of who should\n\n41\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.050\nactually be interested in this show and\nwho should sort of sit and\n\n42\n00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.880\nwatch some of the episodes in this show.\n\n43\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.840\nOkay?\n\n44\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.500\nSo the first thing that I wanna do\nas I've said is just to highlight\n\n45\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.341\nwhat ISO 20,000 is.\n\n46\n00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:06.520\nISO 20,000 is\nthe international standard for\n\n47\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.340\nIT service management,\nall right what does that mean and\n\n48\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.430\nhow does it differ from ITIL\nbecause we've got shows about ITIL.\n\n49\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.160\nAnd of course there's been a lot of\n\n50\n00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.340\ntalk about ITIL around the world\nin the past few years.\n\n51\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.980\nWell ITIL is just a framework\nit is a framework for\n\n52\n00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.842\nmanaging IT services and\nit's at best practice frame work.\n\n53\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.990\nBut there is no audit for ITIL.\n\n54\n00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.860\nThere's nobody that can come in and tell\nyou whether you're doing ITIL right or\n\n55\n00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.820\nwrong because ITIL is a framework that\nyou bring into your organization.\n\n56\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.400\nYou adopt the framework.\n\n57\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.570\nBut then you adapt it in a way\nthat makes common sense,\n\n58\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.190\nperfect sense for your organization.\n\n59\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.520\nSo you adapt it for efficiency and for\neffectiveness in your organization.\n\n60\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.010\nITIL is not plug and play.\n\n61\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.080\nITIL is not a one-size-fits-all approach\nthat will solve all of the world's\n\n62\n00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.650\nproblems.\n\n63\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.960\nCommon misconception there.\n\n64\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.745\nYou know,\nITIL's gonna do everything right.\n\n65\n00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:09.140\n[LAUGH] Well, ITIL doesn't do that.\n\n66\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.250\nITIL is, as I said, just the framework.\n\n67\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.010\nWe won't tell you what your\nprocesses will look like.\n\n68\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.630\nWe'll tell you that you\nneed to have a process.\n\n69\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.590\nAnd we'll tell you how to in I-Tel,\nhow to define a process as well.\n\n70\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.940\nSo we'll tell you that you need to have\na process for restoring service operation.\n\n71\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.930\nIn other words, for getting people back up\nand running when something's gone wrong.\n\n72\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.770\nAnd in I-Tel In ITIL mind we\ncall this incident management.\n\n73\n00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.380\nAnd so\nwe'll tell you that you need to work out\n\n74\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.260\nwhat incident management looks like for\nyour organization.\n\n75\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.515\nSo you will need to have\na process to restore service.\n\n76\n00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:51.635\nWhen it goes wrong,\nto get it back up and running again.\n\n77\n00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:55.955\nAnd so what ITIL does is ITIL says to\nyou okay, you need to have this process.\n\n78\n00:03:55.955 --> 00:04:01.355\nHere's some,\nI was gonna say hints and tips.\n\n79\n00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:05.545\nHere's some very useful information that's\ngoing to help you define a process.\n\n80\n00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.220\nWill tell you that you start by working\nat what your process should do.\n\n81\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.640\nWork at its objective and\nthen work out the output from the process.\n\n82\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.980\nSo what should the output\nfrom a process look like?\n\n83\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.560\nThen what about the inputs?\n\n84\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.740\nThe various inputs to a process.\n\n85\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.640\nAnd then, okay, what steps do you need\nin your organization to ensure that\n\n86\n00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.580\nwe get from the inputs to the outputs.\n\n87\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.145\nAnd this is what ITIL will tell you.\n\n88\n00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:35.770\nITIL will tell you not only what\nprocesses you should have, but\n\n89\n00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.770\nalso how to define those processes.\n\n90\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.250\nBut we won't tell you what your\nprocesses look like, not in ITIL.\n\n91\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.790\nSo there can't be an audit for ITIL.\n\n92\n00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.775\nNobody can come along, even me.\n\n93\n00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:48.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n94\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.640\nI like to think of myself as fairly\nknowledgeable on the subject.\n\n95\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.460\nSo I can't come along and say,\nyes, that's working great for\n\n96\n00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.950\nyour organization using the checklist.\n\n97\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.160\nI can't do that.\n\n98\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.694\nI can't audit you from here.\n\n99\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.160\nThere is no iTel compliance.\n\n100\n00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.070\nAnd this is something that's a common\nmisconception amongst everybody that tries\n\n101\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.490\nto implement ITIL,\nis that you can be ITIL compliant.\n\n102\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.490\nAnd you can't be ITIL compliant,\ncuz there's no right or wrong with ITIL.\n\n103\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.130\nSo, The question that I ask is though,\n\n104\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.730\nwhat's the difference between ITIL and\nISO 20000.\n\n105\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.350\nWell, that's what ITIL is.\n\n106\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.400\nITIL's a framework for managing services,\n\n107\n00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.155\nit's the best practice framework that\nyou adapt to sync your organization.\n\n108\n00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:40.235\nSo how do you know if\nit's working okay then?\n\n109\n00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:43.025\nHow do you know if ITIL is working great?\n\n110\n00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:45.915\nWell when we have something\nthat's completely independent,\n\n111\n00:05:45.915 --> 00:05:47.545\ncompletely separate.\n\n112\n00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:49.665\nHas absolutely nothing to do with ITIL.\n\n113\n00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:53.775\nI say that with a wink all right.\n\n114\n00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:57.270\nHas absolutely nothing to\ndo with ITIL whatsoever.\n\n115\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.030\nWe have an international standard for\nservice management,\n\n116\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.900\nfor IT service management.\n\n117\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.010\nAnd with any international standard,\n\n118\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.765\nan international standard is\nsomething that you attain.\n\n119\n00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:11.879\nIt's something that you achieve,\n\n120\n00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.987\nit's something that you can\nsay that you can comply with.\n\n121\n00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:21.740\nISO 20,000 is a standard,\n\n122\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.240\nwhere you can measure yourself against and\nit's a standard for\n\n123\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.950\ndemonstrating efficiency and\neffectiveness and\n\n124\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:40.170\nthe relationships in place between\nIT service management processes.\n\n125\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.370\nSo, it's a standard for demonstrating\n\n126\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.550\nthat you are able to\nmanage your IT services\n\n127\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.259\nin a way that is the most efficient and\neffective for your organization.\n\n128\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.600\nSo it's a standard where\nyou are audited against\n\n129\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.800\nyour processes and your services,\nto ensure that your processes and\n\n130\n00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.530\nservices are delivering\nvalue to your organization,\n\n131\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.170\nthat you have the right processes\nin place in order to achieve this.\n\n132\n00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.260\nBut also, and when I say achieve this\nI mean achieve value delivery, but\n\n133\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.510\nalso that those processes work\nefficiently and effectively.\n\n134\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.840\nThat they're not bound down by\nbureaucracy, that they're actually\n\n135\n00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.760\nworking in a way that will deliver\nthe most value to your organization.\n\n136\n00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.280\nSo ISO 20000 does not audit ITIL.\n\n137\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.280\nThis is not an ITIL audit.\n\n138\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.990\nITIL is just a best practice framework,\nand there are lots of other frameworks.\n\n139\n00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.440\nEven proprietary frameworks\nthat are out there.\n\n140\n00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.378\nThere are a lot of organizations\nthat have created proprietary\n\n141\n00:07:54.378 --> 00:07:56.527\nframeworks for instance.\n\n142\n00:07:56.527 --> 00:07:57.385\nAnd of course,\n\n143\n00:07:57.385 --> 00:08:01.610\nwhat you evolve in your organization\nbecomes your proprietary framework.\n\n144\n00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.690\nNow your proprietary management\nframework will achieve ISO 20000,\n\n145\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.700\nas long as it is efficient and\n\n146\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:15.210\nit is effective in the processes and\nthe way that IT is managed.\n\n147\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.050\nSo there is a big\ndifference between the two.\n\n148\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:26.200\nISO 20000 is a standard for\nthe management of services.\n\n149\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.700\nNow, if you have implemented ITIL in\na way that is the best practice for\n\n150\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.539\nyour organization, then that will\nhelp you to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n151\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.391\nI am not gonna tell you that\nif you got ITIL implemented,\n\n152\n00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:44.130\nthen you're definitely\ngoing to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n153\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.898\nCuz that's not the case.\n\n154\n00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:51.030\nCuz if you've got an ITIL framework\nimplemented in your organization.\n\n155\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:56.820\nThen unless you have modified and\nadapted that ITIL framework in a way that\n\n156\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.530\nis the most efficient for you, then you're\nnot going to achieve ISO 20000 at all.\n\n157\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.760\nYou will only achieve ISO 20000 if\nyou can meet all of the requirements\n\n158\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.960\nthat are outlined in the ISO 20000,\nwe call them parts.\n\n159\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.080\nSo these are the requirements\nof ISO 20000.\n\n160\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.350\nSo ISO 20000, as I've said,\nis something that you achieve.\n\n161\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.830\nAnd it is something that you will have\nan auditor come to your organization.\n\n162\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.630\nAnd this is after you've had a lot of\ntime to prepare for this, by the way.\n\n163\n00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:40.350\nAnd an auditor will look at your\nprocesses and look at your environment.\n\n164\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.320\nAnd look at the tools and\nthe management that you have in place, and\n\n165\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.720\nthe way that you work.\n\n166\n00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.070\nAnd we'll assess whether you\nhave achieved all of the clauses\n\n167\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.650\nwithin the ISO 20000 requirement.\n\n168\n00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.500\nSo ISO 20000, as I've said,\nis not dependent on ITIL at all.\n\n169\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.720\nHowever, if you have an ITIL based\nframework in place, and it's working\n\n170\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.840\nefficiently and effectively, then it will\ncertainly help you to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n171\n00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.702\nCherokee, you have a question.\n\n172\n00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:16.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Jo, I know you've taught some\npretty high level courses here ITProTV.\n\n173\n00:10:16.745 --> 00:10:18.807\nAnd just looking at the title for\nthis one,\n\n174\n00:10:18.807 --> 00:10:21.570\nyou're talking about the auditing process.\n\n175\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.666\nNow this course that\nwe're about to get into,\n\n176\n00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:26.427\nthis isn't one that will prepare\nus to be auditors, per se.\n\n177\n00:10:26.427 --> 00:10:30.147\nBut looking at the foundations, we want to\nget a good understanding in order to be\n\n178\n00:10:30.147 --> 00:10:33.145\nable to facilitate this implementation,\ncorrect?\n\n179\n00:10:33.145 --> 00:10:37.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what this course will do\nis this course will prepare you for.\n\n180\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.530\n&gt;&gt; It will tell you all about\nthe requirements for an ISO 20000 audit,\n\n181\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.555\nas it were.\n\n182\n00:10:41.555 --> 00:10:42.880\nOkay.\n\n183\n00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.280\nSo we use this course.\n\n184\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.790\nAnd in fact, on this particular slide\nthat we've got in front of us now.\n\n185\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.170\nWe use this course,\njust take a look at the target audience.\n\n186\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:56.636\nWe would use this course to prepare\npeople for an audit for ISO 20000.\n\n187\n00:10:56.636 --> 00:10:59.940\nPerfect.\nA lot of organizations will implement\n\n188\n00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.440\nan ITIL based framework.\n\n189\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.240\nAnd I won't say ITIL based framework,\ncuz you never implement ITIL.\n\n190\n00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.380\nYou always implement ITIL based.\n\n191\n00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.990\nAnd so what will happen is, organizations\nget to a point where they perceive\n\n192\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.650\nthat they have implemented this framework,\nand that it's working, great.\n\n193\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.100\nAnd that they are working efficiently and\neffectively.\n\n194\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.930\nAnd so what do we do now, then?\n\n195\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.320\nWe can't demonstrate ITIL compliance.\n\n196\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.080\nSo what do we do?\n\n197\n00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.730\nWe wanna have that certificate,\nwe wanna have that plaque on the wall.\n\n198\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.282\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we wanna get some kind of.\n\n199\n00:11:28.282 --> 00:11:29.340\nRecognition.\nRecognition for\n\n200\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.290\nour hard work that we've\nput into everything.\n\n201\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.870\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\nwhy the target audience for this is for\n\n202\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.210\nthose organizations that are saying,\nokay, I wanna get some recognition now.\n\n203\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.720\nHow do I do this?\n\n204\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.850\nAnd so it's at this point in time where an\norganization might look for recognition,\n\n205\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.850\nand the first place that they will come\nto is the international standards.\n\n206\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.690\nAnd your international standard,\nyour ISO 20000, will actually give them\n\n207\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.550\nrecognition for having a service\nmanagement framework in place.\n\n208\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.160\nNot necessarily ITIL.\n\n209\n00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.900\nBut it's a management framework that\n\n210\n00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.610\nwill promote the delivery of\nvalue to the business, itself.\n\n211\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.260\nSo the target audience for\n\n212\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.270\nthis are all those people who are going\nto be involved in an ISO 20000 audit.\n\n213\n00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.330\nSo all of those people that\nare preparing for an ISO 20000 audit.\n\n214\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.350\nThese are all of those people that\nare gonna be involved in the actual\n\n215\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.980\naudit process.\n\n216\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.890\nAnd all of those people within IT.\n\n217\n00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.660\nAnd it says here in that second\nbullet point down underneath it,\n\n218\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.650\nthe target audience.\n\n219\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.790\nIt says managers,\nteam leaders, and other staff.\n\n220\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.675\n&gt;&gt; Right, because I don't think it's\njust isolated to the IT department.\n\n221\n00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.790\nThose other stakeholders should\nat least understand what\n\n222\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.530\nthey're approaching before the audit,\nright?\n\n223\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.090\n&gt;&gt; The biggest misconception for\n\n224\n00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:51.050\nISO 20000 is that we're just going to let\nall the managers know what's going on.\n\n225\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.480\nAnd as far as letting everybody else know,\nthey don't need to be involved.\n\n226\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.720\nBut that's not the case.\n\n227\n00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.800\nIf I'm conducting an ISO 20000 audit,\nthen,\n\n228\n00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.222\nI may come up to you,\nno matter who you are.\n\n229\n00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:03.900\nI may come up to you,\n\n230\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.318\nand I may say to you, could you show me\nwhere your security policy is, please?\n\n231\n00:13:08.318 --> 00:13:09.088\nSure Jo.\n\n232\n00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.070\n[LAUGH] Right, now.\n\n233\n00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.685\nOr like, I don't know what that is.\n\n234\n00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:15.800\nRight, exactly.\n\n235\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.210\nAnd this is the problems that we have.\n\n236\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.100\nAs auditors, you could ask that sort\nof question of absolutely everybody.\n\n237\n00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.940\nNow, if you're not able to answer that,\n\n238\n00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.500\nthen obviously, that's going to be\na problem for you in the audit.\n\n239\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.250\nSo this is not just a case of\nthe management being involved.\n\n240\n00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.110\nThat target audience\nspecifically says other stuff.\n\n241\n00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.860\nNow in that first bullet point for\nthe target audience,\n\n242\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.880\nwe talk about managers,\nservice owners, and process owners.\n\n243\n00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.840\nBecause these are the people that\nhave to drive the compliance.\n\n244\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.270\nThey have to drive all of the activities\nthat will get them to this compliance.\n\n245\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.150\nBut nevertheless,\neverybody needs to be aware.\n\n246\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.340\nAnd we mentioned internal auditors.\n\n247\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.420\nAnd we'll always tell you before you\nactually have your official ITIL audit,\n\n248\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.650\nyou should be auditing yourselves.\n\n249\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.000\nYou can get hold of.\n\n250\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.660\nAnd as you start moving down this path,\n\n251\n00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.160\nyou will be able to get hold of the check\nlist, etc., that auditors are looking for.\n\n252\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.045\nThat they're checking against,\nthey're auditing against.\n\n253\n00:14:20.045 --> 00:14:25.640\nThen you will be able to see exactly\nwhere you are on achievement.\n\n254\n00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.170\nAnd so we expect internal auditors\nto be completely involved in this.\n\n255\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.770\nNow, whether you want to\nput your internal staff,\n\n256\n00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.810\nsome of your internal staff on\nan ISO 20000 auditor course.\n\n257\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.800\nThen that's something that we\nwould recommend that you do.\n\n258\n00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.876\nBecause obviously, for those organizations\nthat are looking to implement ISO 20000.\n\n259\n00:14:45.876 --> 00:14:48.660\nRight.\nOr are looking to achieve ISO 20000, then.\n\n260\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Setting yourself up for\nsuccess, basically.\n\n261\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.105\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\ndon't set yourself up for failure.\n\n262\n00:14:54.105 --> 00:14:55.646\nRight.\nNow one of the things that,\n\n263\n00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:58.379\nif you notice here,\nwe've got prerequisites here.\n\n264\n00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:02.070\nAnd prerequisites are that\nyou need to have at\n\n265\n00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.170\nleast two years worth of IT service\nmanagement experience, it says.\n\n266\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.340\nOr hold the ITIL Foundation Certificate.\n\n267\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.990\nPersonally, I would recommend both.\n\n268\n00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; There are a lot of\n\n269\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.890\npeople that will come into IT.\n\n270\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.200\nAnd one of the first things that they do.\n\n271\n00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.240\nAnd, in fact, university students\nnow who gain sort of master's,\n\n272\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.430\netc., within IT, itself.\n\n273\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.930\nOr within a particular\ntopic within technology.\n\n274\n00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.480\n&gt;&gt; Computer science, yeah.\n\n275\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, computer science, etc.\n\n276\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.640\nThey come into the IT world and\ninto our environment.\n\n277\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:42.240\nAnd the first thing that they do is that\nthey either take an ITIL foundation class,\n\n278\n00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.060\nor they are put on an ITIL foundation\nclass by their organization.\n\n279\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.160\nWe would say that you need to have some\nexperience to go with this, as well.\n\n280\n00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.440\nWe're talking about an audit.\n\n281\n00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.796\nWe're talking about\nan international standard.\n\n282\n00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:57.212\nSo we're talking about not just\nan in-depth knowledge of IT and\n\n283\n00:15:57.212 --> 00:15:58.740\nan in-depth knowledge of.\n\n284\n00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:05.240\nSo Unix, or\nwhatever spectrum you work within.\n\n285\n00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.960\nBut we're also talking about\n\n286\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.880\nhaving an understanding of\nthe IT environment as a whole.\n\n287\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.810\n&gt;&gt; Right, and business practices.\n\n288\n00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes students don't have that,\n\n289\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.850\nper se, when they're entering.\n\n290\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.820\nSo that's great that we are able to\nactually provide this kind of training.\n\n291\n00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\nSo\n\n292\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.280\nthis is not just a case of\ngetting the qualifications.\n\n293\n00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.288\nYou've really gotta understand,\ncertainly with ISO 20000, you've\n\n294\n00:16:30.288 --> 00:16:35.604\ngotta understand the environment before\nyou can work towards any achievements,\n\n295\n00:16:35.604 --> 00:16:40.318\nand any sort of checking the boxes\nthat work for any audit requirements.\n\n296\n00:16:40.318 --> 00:16:43.896\nSo I would definitely say that you should\nhave at least two years worth of IT\n\n297\n00:16:43.896 --> 00:16:46.010\nservice management experience.\n\n298\n00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.160\nHowever, that said,\nwhen you are a new student and\n\n299\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.370\nyou're coming into an organization that's\nin the middle of trying to achieve\n\n300\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.820\nISO 20000 compliance, then in that case,\neverybody needs to be made aware.\n\n301\n00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.430\nAnd so there's definitely should be\nsome case of, or some instance of,\n\n302\n00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.930\noverviews that are happening\nwith everyone that's involved\n\n303\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.469\nin IT when we're trying\nto achieve ISO 20000.\n\n304\n00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.640\nSo that's a little bit about ISO 20000,\nso what about this class itself?\n\n305\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.470\nWell this class is\nthe introduction into ISO 20000,\n\n306\n00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.050\nthis is not the auditor's class.\n\n307\n00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.600\nThis is actually the class that we\nwould give to absolutely everybody\n\n308\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.540\nthat is involved within IT.\n\n309\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.743\nWho, in an IT organization\nwhere they are looking to\n\n310\n00:17:34.743 --> 00:17:39.040\nachieve an ISO 20,000\ncompliant certificate.\n\n311\n00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.680\nSo this is a class,\nthis is a general 3-day class,\n\n312\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.760\nwith a test a the end of it\nthat we will give to, as I say,\n\n313\n00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:52.570\nabsolutely everybody that is involved\nin the ISO 20000 audit process.\n\n314\n00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.180\nSo what is the class made up of then?\n\n315\n00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.195\nWell, the class is made up of, and\nhere's just a very quick break down.\n\n316\n00:17:59.195 --> 00:18:03.166\n20% of looking at the scope of ISO 20000.\n\n317\n00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:07.870\n10% talking about the service\nmanagement system.\n\n318\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.260\nWe're also going to be talking about\nservice management processes, and\n\n319\n00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.070\nI will add a caveat in when we talk\nabout service management processes.\n\n320\n00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.680\nThis is not an ITIL class, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.750\nThis is not an ITIL show.\n\n322\n00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.088\nThis is ISO 20000, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:23.088 --> 00:18:28.790\nThis is where we audit against a standard.\n\n324\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.100\nYou might hear some terminology that you\nmight think to yourself, hang on a minute,\n\n325\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.240\nthat sounds a little bit like ITIL.\n\n326\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.100\nThis is not ITIL.\n\n327\n00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.180\nThis is an international standard.\n\n328\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.680\nWe also look at achieving certification.\n\n329\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.740\nWe also look at continual improvement\nwithin your organization.\n\n330\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.490\nAnd then we will look at\nthe audit activities and\n\n331\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.870\nwe will also do assessments.\n\n332\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:58.210\nAnd you will have exercises in your\ndownloadable material to actually\n\n333\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:03.570\nperform your own self-assessment exercises\ntoo, to test your own knowledge.\n\n334\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.410\nNow you do have an exam ,and\nthat exam is available to you.\n\n335\n00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:14.560\nAnd of course, all of your information\nwill be held in the last episode\n\n336\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.170\nof this particular class,\nwhere we'll go over the exam for you.\n\n337\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.050\nIt's a one-hour test.\n\n338\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.400\nIt's 40 questions.\n\n339\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.769\nYou have to get 26 out of 40, or\n65%, in order to pass the test.\n\n340\n00:19:24.769 --> 00:19:27.965\nNow, people will tell me, and they do,\n\n341\n00:19:27.965 --> 00:19:32.880\nthat that sounds very much\nlike an ITIL Foundation test.\n\n342\n00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.740\nYou know, 40 questions, you've got to\nget 26 out of 40 in order to pass.\n\n343\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.580\nIt does sound like an ITIL Foundation\ntest, you're right.\n\n344\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.910\nHowever, and this is where, again,\nanother one of my caveats some in.\n\n345\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.770\nIf you take your ITIL Foundation\nknowledge into an ISO 20000 test,\n\n346\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:57.790\nthere is a good chance that\nyou will trip yourself up.\n\n347\n00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.580\nBecause whilst the concept remains\nthe same, the terminology might not.\n\n348\n00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.990\nSo there are some things that\nare going to be tested on\n\n349\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.580\nthis particular class that might\nbe from certainly a different\n\n350\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.754\nperspective to that which is\ntested in ITIL Foundation.\n\n351\n00:20:17.754 --> 00:20:22.588\nSo this is a very,\nvery clear warning to you to\n\n352\n00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:26.800\nnot confuse ITIL with ISO 20000.\n\n353\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.780\nITIL is a best practice framework.\n\n354\n00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:36.100\nAnd having an ITIL-based framework\nimplemented will help you to achieve\n\n355\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:41.140\nISO 20000, but it's not a guarantee.\n\n356\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.470\nAnd here in ISO 20000, in this\nparticular show, and in these episodes,\n\n357\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:51.600\nwe are going to be concentrating on\nthe actual international standard itself,\n\n358\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:57.260\nand certification for\nthe international standard.\n\n359\n00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Jo,\njust to break it down a little bit for\n\n360\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.780\nthat name, because I thought this was\nkind of interesting for me anyways.\n\n361\n00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:08.280\nIt might not be to you, but with the ISO\ncoming from the Greek word isos, meaning\n\n362\n00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.590\nequal, because it's really international\nhere, we have to keep that in mind.\n\n363\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.540\nIt's not tied to any\none particular country.\n\n364\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:21.970\nAnd then also looking at that last part,\nthe 20011, which is referencing that\n\n365\n00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.640\nversion, this iteration of this\nparticular, I guess, what is it?\n\n366\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.390\nExam, or that particular standard.\n\n367\n00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.164\nBecause when I worked in\nthe manufacturing facility,\n\n368\n00:21:32.164 --> 00:21:35.916\nyes there was ISO compliance, but\nit was really geared toward a product.\n\n369\n00:21:35.916 --> 00:21:40.208\nBut this is really cool because we're\ntalking about being compliant or\n\n370\n00:21:40.208 --> 00:21:43.714\nobtaining that certification,\nor that compliance, for\n\n371\n00:21:43.714 --> 00:21:47.955\nnot necessarily a product, but\nwe're talking about the IT service.\n\n372\n00:21:47.955 --> 00:21:49.695\nSo that's really neat.\n\n373\n00:21:49.695 --> 00:21:53.520\n&gt;&gt; ISO 20000 is quite unique\nin as much as, in terms of IT,\n\n374\n00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.480\nit's really, really difficult to obtain\nan international standard for IT.\n\n375\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.780\nBecause every single service for\nevery organization is different.\n\n376\n00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.580\nAnd every single service is used\nin a completely different way,\n\n377\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.500\nbecause the organization has\na completely different purpose as well.\n\n378\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it is, in one respect,\n\n379\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.380\nit's quite a prestigious\naccreditation to achieve.\n\n380\n00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.620\nBecause it's quite a difficult\none to demonstrate.\n\n381\n00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.670\nWhich is why I say, in one respect,\nit's quite difficult.\n\n382\n00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:30.170\nNow, if you are fully\nconversant with ITIL, and\n\n383\n00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.810\nif you've got an ITIL-based\nframework in place.\n\n384\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.180\nAnd you have been working in a way\nthat is efficient and effective,\n\n385\n00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.830\nthen really what we're asking you to\ndo is, we're asking you to prove it.\n\n386\n00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.940\nAnd I like to use the word,\n\n387\n00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.970\nshow me, because that's exactly\nwhat we're doing here in ISO 20000.\n\n388\n00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.900\nThis is where we come along and\nwe say, show me.\n\n389\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.170\nShow me that it's working,\nshow me that it's efficient.\n\n390\n00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.190\nThis is about the proof.\n\n391\n00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.580\nBut it's very prestigious to have\nthe ISO 20000 certification.\n\n392\n00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:05.230\nAnd it's true that a lot of organizations\nwill put a lot of effort and\n\n393\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.500\na lot of investment into achieving\nthis international standard.\n\n394\n00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:13.280\nNow, the international standard\nis updated on a regular basis.\n\n395\n00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.360\nIt was first implemented in 2005.\n\n396\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.600\nAnd as you say, it was updated in 2011,\n\n397\n00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.330\nand we will be looking to\nupdate the standard again.\n\n398\n00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.290\nAnd I know that I have colleagues that\nare working on this right now as we speak,\n\n399\n00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:31.050\nlooking to update the standard\nagain n the near future,\n\n400\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.300\nbecause we like to make\nsure that it's current.\n\n401\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.440\nAnd certainly when we're talking about IT,\nand IT services,\n\n402\n00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.270\nthe IT environment changes very,\nvery rapidly.\n\n403\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.645\nSo ISO 20000 is something\nthat is here to stay.\n\n404\n00:23:44.645 --> 00:23:49.380\nIt is something that certainly\nis very prestigious.\n\n405\n00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.510\nBut it's also something that a lot\nof organizations will use the ISO\n\n406\n00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:59.466\n20000 audit as an internal measure,\njust for themselves.\n\n407\n00:23:59.466 --> 00:24:03.708\nNot to try and achieve any accreditation,\nbut just as an internal measure as to how\n\n408\n00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:06.890\nefficient and\nhow effective their IT processes are.\n\n409\n00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.730\nAnd we would certainly encourage that,\nand that's one of the reasons why\n\n410\n00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.840\nwe want to make this class\navailable to everybody here today.\n\n411\n00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.870\nIs because there are organizations\nout there that simply want to measure\n\n412\n00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:26.380\nhow effective and how efficient\ntheir IT service provision is,\n\n413\n00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.140\nand they have no way of measuring that.\n\n414\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.830\nAnd this can be available\nto your organization\n\n415\n00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.270\non an individual basis for\nyou just to measure against,\n\n416\n00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:42.460\nwithout going through the formal\nprocess of actual auditing itself.\n\n417\n00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:48.610\nAnd so in ways like we use methodologies\nlike CMMI to measure process maturity,\n\n418\n00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:52.740\nthis takes this one step further\nbecause process maturity is\n\n419\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.470\nsomething that we look at in isolation.\n\n420\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.120\nAnd we look at each process in isolation.\n\n421\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.150\nHere, with ISO 20000, we're not\nlooking at processes in isolation.\n\n422\n00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:06.230\nWe're looking at IT as a whole, and we're\nlooking to see how it hangs together,\n\n423\n00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.980\nhow it gels together, what\nthe relationships are between processes.\n\n424\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.800\nIf you don't have any relationships\nbetween your processes,\n\n425\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.830\nyou're not going to achieve\nISO 20000 compliance.\n\n426\n00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:22.400\nSo this can be used internally within your\norganization, just as a yardstick, just\n\n427\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.600\nto see really how efficient and effective\nyou are at managing your services.\n\n428\n00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's pretty cool, Jo.\n\n429\n00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:33.107\nI mean, not only are our companies and\norganizations, like you said, using it as\n\n430\n00:25:33.107 --> 00:25:37.444\nan investment for brand reputation or\ninternal-type auditing purposes.\n\n431\n00:25:37.444 --> 00:25:40.508\nBut you guys are here,\nalso investing in yourself.\n\n432\n00:25:40.508 --> 00:25:45.765\nSo I'm pretty excited, if I could\neven speak, to get this show started.\n\n433\n00:25:45.765 --> 00:25:48.925\nSo is there anything else we need to think\nof before we go ahead and close out?\n\n434\n00:25:48.925 --> 00:25:52.371\n&gt;&gt; No, in our next session,\nthen we're really going to start and\n\n435\n00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:55.115\ngett into sort of the meat\nbehind ISO 20000.\n\n436\n00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:59.330\nAnd we're going to look in a lot more\ndepth at about what the requirements are.\n\n437\n00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.360\nAnd we're gonna start\ntalking about terminology,\n\n438\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.250\nand we'll start talking about clauses,\nand part one, part two, right away.\n\n439\n00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we get to part 11 and, yeah.\n\n440\n00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:09.208\n&gt;&gt; You say it like it's a bad thing, but\n\n441\n00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:12.315\nthere's a lot of really great information\nthat we're gonna be covering, guys.\n\n442\n00:26:12.315 --> 00:26:14.510\nSo just be prepared for that.\n\n443\n00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.280\nBut I think-\n&gt;&gt; Tune in.\n\n444\n00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.940\n&gt;&gt; I think that's about it for\nthis show so we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n445\n00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.340\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n446\n00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n447\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.620\n&gt;&gt; See you here next time here at ITProTV.\n\n448\n00:26:22.620 -->

00:00:08.344\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:12.050\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.854\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen to your\nISO/IEC 20000:2011 Fundamental Series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:19.550\nI'm you show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.060\nIn this episode, we'll be really\njust delving a little deeper\n\n8\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.060\ninto what the certification is all about,\nproviding an overview.\n\n9\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.798\nAnd back in studios with us today\nwe have ISO expert Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:34.260\nThank you for joining us, Jo.\n\n11\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.410\n&gt;&gt; That's okay,\nthank you Cherokee for having me.\n\n12\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.540\nLet's make this a little bit easier,\ncan we just call this ISO 20000?\n\n13\n00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.253\n&gt;&gt; We sure can.\n\n14\n00:00:40.253 --> 00:00:41.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:43.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna argue there.\n\n16\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.170\n&gt;&gt; It's okay,\n\n17\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.440\nI just like giving her the tongue twister\nat the start of the episodes, it's great.\n\n18\n00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.976\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, keeps me fresh, right?\n\n19\n00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:50.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well it gives me something to laugh\n\n20\n00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.215\nat, anyway.\n\n21\n00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:53.785\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure you're not the only one, Jo.\n\n22\n00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:57.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yes, in this particular\n\n23\n00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.510\nepisode then we're just going to get\nourselves started on ISO 20000 itself.\n\n24\n00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.160\nAnd take a look at the parts for\n\n25\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.460\nISO 20000 and\nwhat it is we've got to adhere to and\n\n26\n00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.380\nall of the resources that are gonna\nbe able to help us with ISO 20000 and\n\n27\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.940\nwe're also going to start and look and\nsome terms and some definitions.\n\n28\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.420\nNow, for those of you that\nhave taken an ITIL class, and\n\n29\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.705\nthat do have any ITIL certifications, I'm\ngonna start off with a word of warning.\n\n30\n00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:32.450\nAnd that word of warning is\nthat not all of the terms and\n\n31\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.500\nthe definitions are exactly\nthe same as ITIL, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.375\nSo be very, very, very careful\nespecially if you are looking to\n\n33\n00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:46.346\nattain the ISO 20000 Foundation\ncertification yourself,\n\n34\n00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:51.432\nthen just be warned not all of\nthe terminology is exactly the same.\n\n35\n00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:55.696\nBecause as I say,\nhere as I said in a previous episode,\n\n36\n00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:59.591\nhere in ISO 20000 we\nare going to be measuring\n\n37\n00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:04.417\nyour organization against efficiency and\neffectiveness and\n\n38\n00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:09.660\nthe value delivery to your\ncustomers in your business itself.\n\n39\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.340\nWe are not testing your knowledge of ITIL.\n\n40\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.250\nITIL is completely different.\n\n41\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.765\nAnd whilst you may have\nan ITIL framework or\n\n42\n00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:20.850\nan ITIL-based framework in\nplace in your organization\n\n43\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.300\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you would be\nable to achieve ISO 20000 accreditation.\n\n44\n00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.220\nAnd just because you're working\ntowards ISO 20000 accreditation,\n\n45\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.070\nit doesn't mean that you've got\nan ITIL-based framework in place.\n\n46\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.160\nIt could mean that you have a very similar\nproprietary framework in place in your\n\n47\n00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.000\norganization, and you may still be able\nto achieve ISO 20000 accreditation.\n\n48\n00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.040\nSo please,\nwhilst you may see some overlap, be very,\n\n49\n00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.150\nvery careful with the two completely\ndifferent entities, completely different.\n\n50\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.420\nSo what we're going to be\nlooking at today, Cherokee,\n\n51\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.130\nin this particular episode,\nis just some basic definitions and\n\n52\n00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.430\nwe're going to be looking at the different\nparts of the standard itself.\n\n53\n00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.110\n&gt;&gt; So this is probably a good show\nto really take some notes on.\n\n54\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.604\nI'm already trying to jot some down\n[LAUGH] while you're going here,\n\n55\n00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:14.548\nbecause I think this is\na really cool certification.\n\n56\n00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:18.670\nSo, definitely,\njust get ready for some notes.\n\n57\n00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.592\n&gt;&gt; I'm very impressed with\nyour enthusiasm, by the way.\n\n58\n00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:23.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Worried.\n\n59\n00:03:23.382 --> 00:03:25.303\n&gt;&gt; That's the extra coffee\nspeaking right here.\n\n60\n00:03:25.303 --> 00:03:27.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, no I'm just gonna\nkeep giving her the caffeine if\n\n61\n00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:29.200\nthis is what it's going to do.\n\n62\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.067\nI don't know how she'll end up\nby the end of recording today.\n\n63\n00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:33.746\n&gt;&gt; I'll be passed out over here.\n\n64\n00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.154\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, so\n\n65\n00:03:36.154 --> 00:03:41.673\nlet's take a look at just really why an\norganization wants to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n66\n00:03:41.673 --> 00:03:45.189\nAnd that's something that actually\nI get asked a lot of the time is,\n\n67\n00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.685\nwhy do I need to do this?\n\n68\n00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.625\nWell, you don't need to do this at all.\n\n69\n00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:53.433\nBut if you're going to ask yourself\nthe question, how do I demonstrate\n\n70\n00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:58.780\nthat my service-based framework,\nmy service framework is working.\n\n71\n00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.350\nHow do I demonstrate that I actually\nam able to manage my organization,\n\n72\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.020\nmy IT service provider organization\nin an efficient and effective way.\n\n73\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.200\nThen ISO 20000 is going to\nhelp you to demonstrate that.\n\n74\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.100\nIt's going to help you to\narticulate that actually\n\n75\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.450\nyou are working in an efficient and\nan effective way.\n\n76\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.395\nThat you are delivering\nvalue to your services.\n\n77\n00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:27.540\nThink about what it is that our\norganization is trying to achieve.\n\n78\n00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.171\nAnd what it is that we are trying\nto achieve as IT service providers.\n\n79\n00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:36.550\nWe need to make sure that we are aligned\nto the needs of our organization.\n\n80\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.190\nAnd we have to ensure that we keep\nour services up and running and\n\n81\n00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.760\nthat we can demonstrate that we\nare delivering value for money.\n\n82\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.720\nOur organization may also have\nregulation requirements themselves that\n\n83\n00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.241\nthey have to achieve.\n\n84\n00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:56.337\nWe find ISO 20000 is required\nby a lot of organizations where\n\n85\n00:04:56.337 --> 00:05:04.110\nthe actual organization themselves, the\nbusiness themselves are heavily regulated.\n\n86\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.474\nSo in organizations where they\nthemselves are heavily regulated, for\n\n87\n00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:12.411\ninstance, in the drug industry,\nin the healthcare industry.\n\n88\n00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:17.223\nThen it's at that point that we find that\nthese organizations are also looking to\n\n89\n00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:22.770\nachieve ISO 20000 certification within\nthe IT service provider themselves.\n\n90\n00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.340\nSo not only is this a standard for\nexcellence.\n\n91\n00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.370\nNot only does it demonstrate excellence,\nbut it will also\n\n92\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.330\nhelp to demonstrate that\nwe have that efficiency and\n\n93\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.320\nthe effectiveness and the relevance\nwithin our IT service provision.\n\n94\n00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.810\nAnd it may help your organization\nattain other international standards or\n\n95\n00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.140\nother compliance, for instance.\n\n96\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.700\nSo, this is something that IT\nservice providers themselves\n\n97\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.090\nwill utilize in order to, as we say,\ndemonstrate their relevance and\n\n98\n00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.190\ndemonstrate that they\nare delivering value.\n\n99\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:07.870\nAnd so, quite often, we don't necessarily\nhave challenges that we want to overcome,\n\n100\n00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.310\nwhat we have is a value that we\nwant to articulate within IT.\n\n101\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.760\nWe might implement an ITIL-based framework\nin order to overcome challenges.\n\n102\n00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.640\nWe might take a Best Practice framework.\n\n103\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.840\nAnd we might modify that.\n\n104\n00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.020\nWe might adapt it for our environment\nto help us overcome challenges.\n\n105\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.300\nAnd then what we will do is we will then\nbring in ISO 20000 to articulate that\n\n106\n00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.190\nnot only that we've overcome\nthese challenges, but\n\n107\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.770\nactually that we are continuing\nto work in an ongoing manner.\n\n108\n00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.222\nIn an efficient and an effective way.\n\n109\n00:06:42.222 --> 00:06:45.270\nISO 20000 is not something\nthat you implement.\n\n110\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.050\nISO 20000 is something that you\nuse to measure whether your\n\n111\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.714\nimplementation is working or not.\n\n112\n00:06:52.714 --> 00:06:57.983\nSo we don't implement ISO 20000,\nwe audit against ISO 20000.\n\n113\n00:06:57.983 --> 00:06:59.680\nWe'll implement a framework.\n\n114\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.160\nAnd that in itself, if it's implemented\ncorrectly, will help us achieve ISO 20000.\n\n115\n00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.230\nSo let's look at some terms and\ndefinitions then.\n\n116\n00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:16.740\nService management, IT service management\nis a set of capabilities and processes.\n\n117\n00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:25.140\nIt's a capability, it's how capable\nwe are at achieving something.\n\n118\n00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.940\nHow capable we are.\n\n119\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.050\nHow capable are you, do you think,\nCherokee, at say, Unix administration?\n\n120\n00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.313\n&gt;&gt; Not so capable, Jo.\n\n121\n00:07:33.313 --> 00:07:36.838\n[LAUGH] I'm definitely not\na Unix base type girl.\n\n122\n00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:40.720\nCertain type of flavors of Linux I'm\nokay with but definitely not Unix.\n\n123\n00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n124\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.095\nSo what about, let's say, Microsoft then.\n\n125\n00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:49.371\nIn a Microsoft environment,\nhow capable are you at Microsoft?\n\n126\n00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:51.490\n&gt;&gt; That's my deal there, that's my gig.\n\n127\n00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.599\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the jam, right, okay.\n\n128\n00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.922\n&gt;&gt; But how do you demonstrate\nhow capable you are?\n\n129\n00:07:56.922 --> 00:07:59.907\n&gt;&gt; Good question.\n\n130\n00:07:59.907 --> 00:08:01.180\nYou know the answer to this, now come on.\n\n131\n00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.909\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't pretend that you don't know,\n\n132\n00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:04.170\nyou know the answer to this.\n\n133\n00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.790\n&gt;&gt; You can get some certifications.\n\n134\n00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; To go ahead and\n\n135\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.990\nprove your competencies.\n\n136\n00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, excellent.\n\n137\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.680\nSo when I say that Service management\nis a set of capabilities, and\n\n138\n00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.540\nthen I ask the question,\nhow capable are you?\n\n139\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.850\nWell, there is actually a way of\ndemonstrating how capable you are at doing\n\n140\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.510\nyour job, right?\n\n141\n00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.980\nNow, just because you've got an MCSE\ndoesn't mean that you're going to achieve\n\n142\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.460\nISO 20000 accreditation throughout\nthe service provider organization, but\n\n143\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.300\nwe have to demonstrate that we\nare capable of managing our services.\n\n144\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.192\nAnd one of the ways that we demonstrate\npersonally that we're capable\n\n145\n00:08:40.192 --> 00:08:44.837\nof doing our own job, is to attain\ncertification and accreditation.\n\n146\n00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:49.529\nYeah, and MCSE which is something that you\nknow, you are very knowledgeable about,\n\n147\n00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.260\nwell, that's one way of proving,\nthat you have that capability.\n\n148\n00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.120\nSo Service management is about\nensuring that our IT organization has\n\n149\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:06.560\nthe capability to deliver value by way\nof putting services to our customers.\n\n150\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.211\nAnd that we have the processes in place\nin order to enable us to deliver value.\n\n151\n00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:17.179\nYou see, what we have to do,\nis we have to demonstrate that we can\n\n152\n00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:21.200\ncontrol our own activities and\nour resources.\n\n153\n00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:27.030\nAnd manage them in a way that\ndelivers value to our organization.\n\n154\n00:09:28.558 --> 00:09:31.732\nWe have to demonstrate that,\nwhat's happening behind IT,\n\n155\n00:09:31.732 --> 00:09:35.780\nwhat's happening behind the service\ndesk is not just chaos.\n\n156\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.120\n[LAUGH] We have to demonstrate that we\nare organized in a way that's going to\n\n157\n00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.150\ndeliver value.\n\n158\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.480\nAnd we also have to demonstrate\nthat we have the right skills and\n\n159\n00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.310\nthe right capabilities to be able\nto deliver value as well, and\n\n160\n00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.200\nthat we have the right processes in place,\nokay?\n\n161\n00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.280\nSo it's about making sure that\nour teams are working cohesively,\n\n162\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.950\nthat our teams\nare collaborating across teams.\n\n163\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.965\nIt's about demonstrating that our\nprocesses are not too bureaucratic.\n\n164\n00:10:03.965 --> 00:10:09.010\nThat our processes will help us to\nachieve their outcomes, their outcomes,\n\n165\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.770\nnot the outcomes that I wanna set, but\n\n166\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.590\ntheir outcomes, because I don't know what\nincident management looks like for you.\n\n167\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:20.860\nI know what the practice for\nincident management may look like,\n\n168\n00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.410\nbut it's not plug and play, so\nI don't know what it looks like for you.\n\n169\n00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.790\nBut it's about demonstrating that when\nwe talk about a set of capabilities and\n\n170\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.920\nprocesses it's about demonstrating that\nyour processes actually are efficient and\n\n171\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.600\neffective for you.\n\n172\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.790\nAnd demonstrating that\nthe people that are working for\n\n173\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.460\nyou are fully equipped and\nfully capable of doing their work.\n\n174\n00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.010\n&gt;&gt; Right, like you'd mentioned\nbefore everyone has to be onboard,\n\n175\n00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.280\notherwise during that moment of\ncatastrophe or whatever, then your\n\n176\n00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.480\nprocess may just crumble, if your\nemployees aren't even trained on that.\n\n177\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.600\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n178\n00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.130\nAnd it's not just about being\ncapable to do the work.\n\n179\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.780\nIt's not about just having an MCSE.\n\n180\n00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.070\nIt's great, you can have an MCSE.\n\n181\n00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.840\nBut if you don't know how to follow\nthe process of problem management, and\n\n182\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.350\nyou don't know exactly whether you're\nperforming proactive problem management or\n\n183\n00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.920\nwhether you're performing\nreactive problem management, and\n\n184\n00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.400\nyou don't know what you do as\npart of your day to day work.\n\n185\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.150\nYou can have 110 different qualifications,\nbut doesn't actually\n\n186\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.690\nmean that you're any good at the job\nyou've been given to do right now.\n\n187\n00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.220\nYeah, because if I gave you a Unix job\nwithout actually asking whether you were\n\n188\n00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.606\ncapable of doing anything in Unix,\nthen how capable would you be [LAUGH]?\n\n189\n00:11:36.606 --> 00:11:40.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, the organization\nwould find out quickly, wouldn't they?\n\n190\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.194\n&gt;&gt; Incredibly quickly, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n191\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.700\nSo you see, what we're looking at here\nin ISO 20000 is we're looking at that\n\n192\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.490\ndemonstration of capability.\n\n193\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.240\nWe want to see that you're capable,\nthat you have the right processes in\n\n194\n00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.210\nplace to demonstrate that capability,\nand to be\n\n195\n00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.550\nable to deliver value to our\ncustomers through our services.\n\n196\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.290\nSo this is not just about support,\nby the way.\n\n197\n00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.190\nThis is all about the design and\nthe transition.\n\n198\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:19.056\nThat's the build and the text, and the\ndeployment, that delivery ff our services.\n\n199\n00:12:19.056 --> 00:12:24.917\nAnd also then the delivery in a live\nproduction environment and also improving\n\n200\n00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:30.830\nall of our services and our processes\nin an ongoing, a continual basis.\n\n201\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.626\nContinual means iterative,\nit means repeatable.\n\n202\n00:12:33.626 --> 00:12:36.011\nSo it doesn't mean just\na one-off improvement,\n\n203\n00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:39.268\nbecause one-off improvement is\nnot an improvement for very long.\n\n204\n00:12:39.268 --> 00:12:45.349\nIt's about fulfilling\nthe requirements of the organization.\n\n205\n00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:46.810\nIt's their requirements.\n\n206\n00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.500\nSo a process, it's a set of connected,\ninterrelated,\n\n207\n00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:59.160\ninteracting activities that takes inputs\nand then transforms them into outputs.\n\n208\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:05.044\nAnd I've already mentioned in a previous\nepisode already, in fact that,\n\n209\n00:13:05.044 --> 00:13:09.310\nif we take a look at a best practice\nframework for instance, they will give us\n\n210\n00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:14.750\nsome guidelines as to what processes might\nlook like in a best practice environment.\n\n211\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:20.001\nBut it's up to you to create a process,\nto define a process that's going\n\n212\n00:13:20.001 --> 00:13:25.696\nto meet your requirements, that's going\nto transform inputs into outputs.\n\n213\n00:13:25.696 --> 00:13:30.148\nAnd we start of by working on what the\nobjective of the process is, and then you\n\n214\n00:13:30.148 --> 00:13:34.680\ncan then work out what the outputs\nare that you expect from that process.\n\n215\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.516\nAnd then, the inputs.\n\n216\n00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:41.338\nAnd then you come up with,\nyou define the activities that\n\n217\n00:13:41.338 --> 00:13:45.360\nare going to get us from input to output,\nokay?\n\n218\n00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.060\nThe more mature we are,\nthe more capable we are,\n\n219\n00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.820\nthe greater our ability to\nconsistently deliver quality.\n\n220\n00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.086\nIt's not a one-off thing.\n\n221\n00:13:59.086 --> 00:14:04.140\nAnd ISO 20000 as a standard, is not going\nto measure whether you can do this once.\n\n222\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.020\nThis is a continual thing,\nyou've got to be able to do this.\n\n223\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.868\nAnd you've got to be able to do this\nconsistently over a period of time.\n\n224\n00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:15.430\nYes, you'll get an audit and\nyou'll get a one-off audit, but\n\n225\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.340\nthen you'll get into interim audits, and\nthen you'll get another full audit, and\n\n226\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.410\nthen you'll get another couple of interim\naudits and then another full audit.\n\n227\n00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.870\nIt's not just a one-off achievement.\n\n228\n00:14:27.086 --> 00:14:30.370\nISO 20000, it's an international standard.\n\n229\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.610\nIt's based on best practice, yes.\n\n230\n00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.810\nBut it's an international standard, and\n\n231\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.830\nit's all of those requirements\nas we've already said.\n\n232\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:42.153\nThe design and transition and\ndelivery and improvement,\n\n233\n00:14:42.153 --> 00:14:48.678\netc of services, providing value\nto our business, to our customers.\n\n234\n00:14:48.678 --> 00:14:52.663\nIt's about the integration,\nit's about the implementation and\n\n235\n00:14:52.663 --> 00:14:56.110\nthe management of a service\nmanagement system.\n\n236\n00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.360\nThis is not a tool set.\n\n237\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.750\nA service management is not a tool.\n\n238\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.720\nA service management system,\nan SMS, is not a tool set.\n\n239\n00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.190\nA service management system\nis a concept that applies to\n\n240\n00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.300\nthe way that we manage our services.\n\n241\n00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.810\nThat includes all of our policies.\n\n242\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.400\nIn includes all of our processes.\n\n243\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.160\nIt includes a hierarchical\nchart in our management.\n\n244\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.750\nAnd it includes, the tool set that\nwe use to facilitate that, as well.\n\n245\n00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.520\n&gt;&gt; Now Joy,\nI know you had given us that fair warning\n\n246\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.030\nabout ITIL terminology\nversus ISO terminology.\n\n247\n00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.750\nWhen we look at that term,\nservices, as implemented here,\n\n248\n00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.000\nis there any kind of difference or\ndiscrepancy with the ITIL?\n\n249\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.323\nI know you'd covered that several\ndifferent times there, so just asking.\n\n250\n00:15:43.323 --> 00:15:44.566\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I want\n\n251\n00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:47.437\nyou to kind of forget ITIL terminology,\nto be perfectly honest.\n\n252\n00:15:47.437 --> 00:15:49.408\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I want you to look at this as though\n\n253\n00:15:49.408 --> 00:15:52.190\nyou're looking at this with\ncompletely fresh eyes.\n\n254\n00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:52.882\nOn completely brand new.\n\n255\n00:15:52.882 --> 00:15:53.945\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n256\n00:15:53.945 --> 00:15:58.421\n&gt;&gt; Because you see what we're\nconcerned about really here is\n\n257\n00:15:58.421 --> 00:16:03.240\nthe concept more than\nthe actually terminology itself.\n\n258\n00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.480\nNow, sure enough,\nyou're going to be tested.\n\n259\n00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.090\nWhen you do your exam, you're going\nto be tested on the terminology.\n\n260\n00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:14.320\nAnd also when it comes to the actual\nstandard itself, there's going to be,\n\n261\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.520\nthe audit itself, there's going to\nbe a mention of the terminology.\n\n262\n00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.140\nBut don't get too hung up about that,\nbecause what we're looking for\n\n263\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:30.470\nis we're looking to see\ncompliance against the purpose.\n\n264\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.470\nWe want to see that you've got,\nsay incident management,\n\n265\n00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.110\nin place and\nthat it's got a defined purpose.\n\n266\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.290\nAnd that the way you're\nmanaging incident management\n\n267\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.390\nis compliant with the purpose of incident\nmanagement for your organization.\n\n268\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.680\nWe're not going to say is that\npurpose right, yes or no.\n\n269\n00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.530\nWhat we're going to say is okay,\nhave you got a purpose?\n\n270\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.160\nThis is what have you got\na service management system?\n\n271\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.390\nDo you have defined policies and\nare you working to those policies?\n\n272\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.340\nAnd are those processes and\n\n273\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.230\nthose policies,\nare they efficient and effective?\n\n274\n00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n275\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.120\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're not actually going to say is this,\n\n276\n00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.630\nyou know, we're not going to, it's very\ndifficult to articulate sometimes.\n\n277\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.800\nWe're not going to look at an ITIL\nprocess out of the book and\n\n278\n00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.490\nsay do you have this in place?\n\n279\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.550\nBecause if you do, you're probably\nnot going to achieve ISO 20000,\n\n280\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.710\nbecause ITIL's not plug and play.\n\n281\n00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:30.470\nSo I want you to try and forget about ITIL\nand try and forget about the terminology.\n\n282\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.945\nBut at the same time,\nI need you to have it your mind.\n\n283\n00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:35.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, got it.\n\n284\n00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nI mean that makes it so clear, right?\n\n285\n00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.745\n&gt;&gt; No, for me I do understand it\nbecause I've dealt in different vendors\n\n286\n00:17:42.745 --> 00:17:45.932\nwhere the terminology does\nmean different things but\n\n287\n00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:49.636\na lot of the fundamentals are still,\nthey're hard coded in.\n\n288\n00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:53.523\nSo I'm just gonna be building and taking,\nmaybe like I'm scooping that first layer\n\n289\n00:17:53.523 --> 00:17:56.548\nof the terminology layer off but\nI'm keeping the fundamentals.\n\n290\n00:17:56.548 --> 00:17:57.265\nDoes that make sense?\n\n291\n00:17:57.265 --> 00:17:59.795\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n292\n00:17:59.795 --> 00:18:04.610\nSee, what we're doing with\nITIL is we will tell you that\n\n293\n00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.880\nthis is a set of definitions\nthat we use within ITIL.\n\n294\n00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.980\nBut then we'll also tell you\nthat we expect you to adapt\n\n295\n00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.520\nthose definitions to\nsuit your environment.\n\n296\n00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.390\nSo actually,\nnobody has a complete copy of ITIL,\n\n297\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.920\nnobody should have a complete\ncopy of ITIL out of the book.\n\n298\n00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.580\nWe expect you to adapt.\n\n299\n00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.461\n&gt;&gt; Modify.\n\n300\n00:18:25.461 --> 00:18:28.818\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we expect you to adapt\nit to suit your environment,\n\n301\n00:18:28.818 --> 00:18:33.477\nbecause you have to adapt those processes\nin the way that delivers efficiency and\n\n302\n00:18:33.477 --> 00:18:37.125\neffectiveness for you,\nthat delivers best practice for you.\n\n303\n00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:41.575\nAnd then what we will do within ISO 20000\nis that when you reach a point that when\n\n304\n00:18:41.575 --> 00:18:44.756\nyou feel as though you are working\nat your most efficient and\n\n305\n00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:49.208\nyou are delivering your most value,\nthen we'll come along and we'll say, okay,\n\n306\n00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:51.720\ndo you have all of the right\nelements in place?\n\n307\n00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.980\nDo you have in your service management\nsystem refers to all of the policies,\n\n308\n00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.390\nit refers to you know having\nmanagement that are going to guide you.\n\n309\n00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.630\nHaving policies, having processes defined.\n\n310\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.660\nAre those processes defined?\n\n311\n00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.340\nAre they articulated?\n\n312\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.520\nAre they documented?\n\n313\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.600\nAre they subject to version control?\n\n314\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.810\nWe want to make sure that\nyou've got all of that.\n\n315\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.930\nWe're not going to look\nat your process and\n\n316\n00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.270\nsay is that the same as\nwhat's in the ITIL book?\n\n317\n00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.520\nCuz we wanna make sure that\nthe process is relevant for you.\n\n318\n00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n319\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.011\n&gt;&gt; That's what we want to do.\n\n320\n00:19:24.011 --> 00:19:27.450\nAnd while we're talking about terminology,\nlet's take a look at our next slide then.\n\n321\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.950\nAnd our terminology here.\n\n322\n00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.430\nWell, we've got\nthe International Organization for\n\n323\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.290\nStandardization, as we called it.\n\n324\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:41.580\nThat's our ISO, and you mentioned\nthat ISO was based on the Greek?\n\n325\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n326\n00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.160\nPretty cool.\n\n327\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.105\n&gt;&gt; I'm quite impressed by her research.\n\n328\n00:19:47.105 --> 00:19:48.565\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To be totally honest.\n\n329\n00:19:48.565 --> 00:19:49.990\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I had gotten it a long\n\n330\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.660\ntime ago but\nI couldn't remember the origin.\n\n331\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.440\nBut I wanted to say that it was Greek\nbecause they were really trying to\n\n332\n00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.720\nmaintain that.\n\n333\n00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.950\nI guess that, just to be international and\n\n334\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.940\nnot really focus on any one\nparticular language or whatever.\n\n335\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:08.060\nI think it was like English, French and\nRussian are what languages that\n\n336\n00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:14.280\nthey're currently using as far as\nthe material in the exams, is that?\n\n337\n00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if we take a look at,\n\n338\n00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.550\nyou'll notice that the International\nOrganization for Standardization is IOS.\n\n339\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n340\n00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.790\n&gt;&gt; And yet the abbreviation-\n&gt;&gt; It's not the acronym.\n\n341\n00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:30.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, the acronym is actually I-S-O,\nor ISO as we call it.\n\n342\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.090\nAnd that's because it's not just\nabout the Greek connotation.\n\n343\n00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.110\nIt was because they needed to come up with\nan acronym that actually everybody around\n\n344\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.680\nthe world could use, and so\nthat's where they came up with ISO.\n\n345\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.320\nAnd so the International Organization for\nStandardization, as we call it,\n\n346\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.000\nthey publish the ISO standards.\n\n347\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.970\nThat's the iso.org.\n\n348\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.620\nAnd then we've got the International\nElectrotechnical Commission.\n\n349\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.570\nIt sounds better in French by the way but\ndon't ask me to pronounce it right now,\n\n350\n00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.430\nokay [LAUGH].\n\n351\n00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:04.324\nAnd the International Electrotechnical\nCommission is all about technology\n\n352\n00:21:04.324 --> 00:21:05.156\nstandards.\n\n353\n00:21:05.156 --> 00:21:08.682\nSo as it says there,\nit's electrical and electronic and\n\n354\n00:21:08.682 --> 00:21:11.183\nrelated technology standards, okay?\n\n355\n00:21:11.183 --> 00:21:15.410\nNow ISO and\nIEC do not certify organizations.\n\n356\n00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.710\nThat's the interesting part.\n\n357\n00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:22.730\nThey write the standard, but\nit's actually the examining boards and\n\n358\n00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:29.310\nthe examining bodies that will actually\ncome along and certify an organization.\n\n359\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.323\nSo the ISO and\nIEC will approve the standard, but\n\n360\n00:21:33.323 --> 00:21:37.360\nthey are not the ones that examine.\n\n361\n00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.580\nThey are not the ones that audit.\n\n362\n00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.310\nWe have auditing boards\nthat will come along and\n\n363\n00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:47.942\naudit an organization, not\nthe International Standard Organization.\n\n364\n00:21:47.942 --> 00:21:50.950\nThey are just, they take the ownership\nof the actual standard itself.\n\n365\n00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.960\n&gt;&gt; But those auditing boards\nthat I'm assuming, they have to\n\n366\n00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.670\nanswer to them to make sure that they're-\n&gt;&gt; They're accredited by law, yes.\n\n367\n00:21:58.670 --> 00:21:59.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay, right.\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely,\n\n368\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.710\nbecause they are actually\nawarding a standard.\n\n369\n00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n370\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:10.585\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look then at what\nit's made up of then, let's take a look.\n\n371\n00:22:10.585 --> 00:22:14.604\nAnd we've got Parts 1 through Parts 11,\nactually.\n\n372\n00:22:14.604 --> 00:22:16.630\nBut Part 11 is a good one and\n\n373\n00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:22.040\nI don't know why I'll jump to this\none at the first, but anyway I will.\n\n374\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.680\nPart 11 is really is a really good\npublication, because Part 11 is\n\n375\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.820\nthe publication that actually shows\nthe difference between ISO 20000 and ITIL.\n\n376\n00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.040\nSo that makes a very, very good read.\n\n377\n00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:40.480\nPart 1, and this is what we're\nreally gonna spend a lot of time on.\n\n378\n00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.085\nWe're going to spend a lot of time over\nthe next few episodes on Part 1 and\n\n379\n00:22:45.085 --> 00:22:46.080\nPart 2.\n\n380\n00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.713\nAnd Part 1 are the service\nmanagement system requirements.\n\n381\n00:22:49.713 --> 00:22:53.885\nI'll emphasize that word, requirements.\n\n382\n00:22:53.885 --> 00:22:54.630\nThat's what you have to do.\n\n383\n00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.170\nPart 2 is guidance on how\nyou can implement them, and\n\n384\n00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.790\nPart 3 is guidance on the scope.\n\n385\n00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.840\nPart 4 is a process reference model,\nas it says.\n\n386\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.590\nIt's not actually on\nthe syllabus of the audit or\n\n387\n00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.090\non the syllabus of this,\nbecause again it's just a reference model.\n\n388\n00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.452\nIt's just a guide.\n\n389\n00:23:18.452 --> 00:23:20.730\nAnd then we've got\nthe implementation plan,\n\n390\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.290\nwhich is Part 5,\nwhich is a technical report.\n\n391\n00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:29.160\nNow, in terms of your audit,\nyou're audited on Part 1,\n\n392\n00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.930\nwhich are your requirements.\n\n393\n00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.290\nPart 2 is just your guidance.\n\n394\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:39.990\nSo if we take a look here,\nPart 1 which is the shall.\n\n395\n00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:45.349\nSo that's referred to as ISO\n20000-1 which is Part 1.\n\n396\n00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:52.304\nWe call them the shalls,\nyou shall have these, in other words.\n\n397\n00:23:52.304 --> 00:23:54.636\nThis is what you've got to have.\n\n398\n00:23:54.636 --> 00:23:57.028\nThis is what you're audited against,\nwhich is why we-\n\n399\n00:23:57.028 --> 00:23:59.490\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm pledging my,-\n\n400\n00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:00.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.503\n&gt;&gt; I shall do this, I shall do that.\n\n402\n00:24:02.503 --> 00:24:03.767\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, right?\n\n403\n00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:07.987\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you are actually\npledging your allegiance to ISO\n\n404\n00:24:07.987 --> 00:24:12.741\n20000 at this point in time,\nand I am going to do this, and\n\n405\n00:24:12.741 --> 00:24:18.339\nyou'll notice that there are 259\nmandatory requirements in Part 1.\n\n406\n00:24:18.339 --> 00:24:20.095\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we can do this.\n\n407\n00:24:20.095 --> 00:24:21.032\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n408\n00:24:21.032 --> 00:24:26.631\nThat's 259 requirements that you're\ngoing to be audited against.\n\n409\n00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:27.765\nThey're mandatory.\n\n410\n00:24:27.765 --> 00:24:32.753\nThis is not sort of pick and\nchoose or a pick and mix,\n\n411\n00:24:32.753 --> 00:24:35.779\nas we would say when I was a kid.\n\n412\n00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:40.438\nThis is not something that you will\njust pick out certain ones and go, wow,\n\n413\n00:24:40.438 --> 00:24:42.813\nI think I'll stick with that one, no.\n\n414\n00:24:42.813 --> 00:24:46.196\n&gt;&gt; But Jo,\nyou said that this isn't like a surprise.\n\n415\n00:24:46.196 --> 00:24:49.661\nThese 259 are well documented and\nwe'll know about them ahead of\n\n416\n00:24:49.661 --> 00:24:52.470\ntime to make sure that we\nare adhering to them, right?\n\n417\n00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:53.018\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n418\n00:24:53.018 --> 00:24:54.335\nWell, of course, in Part 1,\n\n419\n00:24:54.335 --> 00:24:56.109\nyou've got these managers-\n&gt;&gt; That's what it is?\n\n420\n00:24:56.109 --> 00:24:56.851\nThey're all listed here?\n\n421\n00:24:56.851 --> 00:24:57.369\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\n422\n00:24:57.369 --> 00:25:00.063\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.\n&gt;&gt; It's listed there, and in Part 1,\n\n423\n00:25:00.063 --> 00:25:04.291\nthis is where we just say, hey look,\nthese are your requirements.\n\n424\n00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:07.052\nYou've got to adhere to\nthese requirements, and\n\n425\n00:25:07.052 --> 00:25:09.944\nif you achieve these\nrequirements then yes, okay,\n\n426\n00:25:09.944 --> 00:25:14.563\nthere's a good chance that you'll get\nthrough the audit, these are your shells.\n\n427\n00:25:14.563 --> 00:25:16.189\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You've got to do this.\n\n428\n00:25:16.189 --> 00:25:20.538\n&gt;&gt; This is, as it says here,\nthis is the basis for assessment.\n\n429\n00:25:20.538 --> 00:25:22.163\nIt's the basis for your assessment.\n\n430\n00:25:22.163 --> 00:25:29.095\nIt's the auditing standard, and as it says\nin this particular, let me find this here,\n\n431\n00:25:29.095 --> 00:25:34.450\nthe Shall statements are audited,\nand no deviation is permitted.\n\n432\n00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.730\nIf it's within the scope of\nthe audit that you are performing\n\n433\n00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.780\nthen there is no deviation permitted.\n\n434\n00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:47.260\nIf you don't conform than\nyou don't pass your audit.\n\n435\n00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.820\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n436\n00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:54.235\nBut this why I will say that on\na practical level with ISO 20000,\n\n437\n00:25:54.235 --> 00:26:00.564\nISO 20000 can be used, and Part 1 can\nbe used, as just an internal document.\n\n438\n00:26:00.564 --> 00:26:05.530\nAs just an internal guidance to\nhelp you on internal assessments.\n\n439\n00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.961\nThis is not something that\nall organizations would be\n\n440\n00:26:09.961 --> 00:26:13.907\nlooking to achieve right\naway from the word go.\n\n441\n00:26:13.907 --> 00:26:18.634\nWe would always recommend, I would always\nrecommend that we do internal assessments\n\n442\n00:26:18.634 --> 00:26:22.720\nfirst, and then you may choose to\nstick with your internal assessments.\n\n443\n00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.290\nYou may choose to say, you know what?\n\n444\n00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.570\nI'm quite happy here because\nthis is all about my own\n\n445\n00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.340\npersonal knowledge that actually\nwe're conforming to a standard and\n\n446\n00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.020\nwe're working in a way that\ndelivers value to the organization.\n\n447\n00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.230\nNow, your organization may require\nyou to become certified, but\n\n448\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.180\nthat's a choice that you will make.\n\n449\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.863\n&gt;&gt; Right, so even if you weren't compliant\nwith all 259, you could implement 100 and\n\n450\n00:26:46.863 --> 00:26:50.759\nstill see some kind of measurable\nimprovement within your organization.\n\n451\n00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:52.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, let's look at this.\n\n452\n00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:58.584\nAn organization uses this Part 1 when\nyou wanna have a consistent approach.\n\n453\n00:26:58.584 --> 00:27:02.288\nWhen you want to look at services\nfrom your service provider,\n\n454\n00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:06.778\nfrom an organization itself with\nan assurance that you're working in a way\n\n455\n00:27:06.778 --> 00:27:11.069\nthat's delivering value,\nin a way that's efficient and effective.\n\n456\n00:27:11.069 --> 00:27:15.271\nAnd we as service providers,\nas IT service providers, we use Part 1\n\n457\n00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:19.845\njust to demonstrate that we are working\nin an efficient and effective way.\n\n458\n00:27:19.845 --> 00:27:25.390\nWe also use it as a tool to give\nus something to work towards.\n\n459\n00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:29.980\nSo in other words, we perform a gap\nanalysis on where we are right now against\n\n460\n00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.050\nwhere we want to be, and where we want\nto be might be our Part 1 requirement.\n\n461\n00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.003\nSo we'll use it to monitor\nwhere we are right now, and\n\n462\n00:27:37.003 --> 00:27:39.375\nalso to give us something to work towards.\n\n463\n00:27:39.375 --> 00:27:43.071\nThat last bullet point there,\nabout improving design, and\n\n464\n00:27:43.071 --> 00:27:46.115\ntransition, and delivery of services, etc.\n\n465\n00:27:46.115 --> 00:27:48.578\nAnd then of course as\nan auditor [LAUGH] and\n\n466\n00:27:48.578 --> 00:27:53.742\nassessor well then we'll use part one to\ncome in and say, have you achieved this?\n\n467\n00:27:53.742 --> 00:27:54.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n468\n00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.816\n&gt;&gt; And if you haven't, and\nas we've already said, the Part 1,\n\n469\n00:27:57.816 --> 00:27:59.575\nthere is no deviation from Part 1.\n\n470\n00:27:59.575 --> 00:28:04.076\nAnd so we'll come in and we'll say,\nhave you achieved this yes or no.\n\n471\n00:28:04.076 --> 00:28:09.041\nAnd we'll get a little bit more into the\nactual audit process itself a little bit\n\n472\n00:28:09.041 --> 00:28:09.718\nlater on.\n\n473\n00:28:09.718 --> 00:28:14.933\nAnd then we've got Part 2,\nor ISO/IEC 20000-2,\n\n474\n00:28:14.933 --> 00:28:19.540\nwhich was revised in 2012,\nwhich is guidance.\n\n475\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:25.336\nWe call this the CoP, or\nthe Code of Practice, and\n\n476\n00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:30.711\nit's used by those people that\nwant to actually implement\n\n477\n00:28:30.711 --> 00:28:35.113\na service management framework,\nand the SMS.\n\n478\n00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:40.335\nAnd we use this to well, ensure adherence,\n\n479\n00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:43.589\nshould we say, to Part 1.\n\n480\n00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:48.010\nIn other words, this is guidance on\nhow you can achieve your Part 1.\n\n481\n00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:52.130\nThis is your, let's say, Part 2,\nthe Code of Practice, and\n\n482\n00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.510\nthis will give you hints and tips.\n\n483\n00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.658\nWe use clauses like should.\n\n484\n00:28:57.658 --> 00:28:59.300\nYou should have this in place.\n\n485\n00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.660\nIf you want to achieve\nthis particular mandatory\n\n486\n00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.340\nclause then you should have this in place.\n\n487\n00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:10.610\nYou can have this in place, or\nit's possible to have this in place,\n\n488\n00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.117\nor you may, yes you may do this.\n\n489\n00:29:13.117 --> 00:29:17.883\nNot necessarily gonna be easy for you, but\nyou might do it like this if you want to.\n\n490\n00:29:17.883 --> 00:29:23.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the exam is going to be\ntesting us on these should's and may's?\n\n491\n00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.559\nJust think okay,\nif I wanted to achieve, this,\n\n492\n00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:29.405\nwhat could I do to achieve that, kind of?\n\n493\n00:29:29.405 --> 00:29:33.062\n&gt;&gt; When you say the exam, do you mean\nthe audit, or do you mean your exam?\n\n494\n00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:33.978\n&gt;&gt; Our exam.\n\n495\n00:29:33.978 --> 00:29:34.914\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n496\n00:29:34.914 --> 00:29:39.317\nYour exam is not going to test you too\nmuch on the may's, and on the should's,\n\n497\n00:29:39.317 --> 00:29:44.012\nand on the can's, your exam is going to\nbe on Part 1, which are the requirements.\n\n498\n00:29:44.012 --> 00:29:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And these are the requirements for\n\n499\n00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.840\nITIL [LAUGH].\n\n500\n00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.841\nI shouldn't say that,\nmy goodness, that's terrible.\n\n501\n00:29:50.841 --> 00:29:53.769\n&gt;&gt; We'll see how many times it happens,\nbecause I almost tripped up earlier.\n\n502\n00:29:53.769 --> 00:29:56.286\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, cuz that, guys,\n\n503\n00:29:56.286 --> 00:29:57.697\nneeds editing [LAUGH].\n\n504\n00:29:57.697 --> 00:30:02.550\nYeah, on ISO 20000 [LAUGH],\nyeah, your exam is going to be\n\n505\n00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:07.406\nbased on your requirements for\nthe ISO 20000 Part 1, and\n\n506\n00:30:07.406 --> 00:30:11.989\nfor your requirements for\nthe organization to demonstrate\n\n507\n00:30:11.989 --> 00:30:16.870\nthe achievement of all of\nthe ISO 20,000 Part 1 Shalls.\n\n508\n00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:17.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n509\n00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:23.810\n&gt;&gt; The should's, and the can's, and the\nmay's is just as it says, it's a guidance\n\n510\n00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:29.953\nfor how you can implement service\nmanagement in order to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n511\n00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:33.892\nSo, for this particular episode,\n\n512\n00:30:33.892 --> 00:30:37.711\nwe are now going to leave it there.\n\n513\n00:30:37.711 --> 00:30:44.175\nBecause, now I'm going to give you an\nopportunity to go into your downloadable\n\n514\n00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:49.384\nmaterial, and to review,\nnot only what we've covered so far,\n\n515\n00:30:49.384 --> 00:30:54.512\nbut also to research the ISO\n20000 Part 1 requirements.\n\n516\n00:30:54.512 --> 00:30:59.889\nAnd you'll see exactly what the 259\nmandatory requirements are.\n\n517\n00:30:59.889 --> 00:31:04.155\nAnd so at this point in time this\nis what I would like you to do, and\n\n518\n00:31:04.155 --> 00:31:09.211\nwhen we come back we'll delve a little\nbit further in to our SMS, our service\n\n519\n00:31:09.211 --> 00:31:14.780\nmanagement system, and look at exactly\nhow we will be audited for ISO 20000.\n\n520\n00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.232\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, thanks for\ngiving us a great start there, but\n\n521\n00:31:17.232 --> 00:31:19.060\nit looks like we have\nsome work to do as well.\n\n522\n00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.826\nSo thank you for joining us, but we're\ngonna go ahead and sign out for this show.\n\n523\n00:31:22.826 --> 00:31:24.401\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n524\n00:31:24.401 --> 00:31:25.288\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n525\n00:31:25.288 --> 00:31:27.759\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n526\n00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:33.920\n[MUSIC]\n\n527\n00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.078\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

00:00:08.230\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.602\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\n\n5\n00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:19.736\ngentlemen to your ISO/EIC\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.481\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:23.195\n&gt;&gt; And that's easy for you to say.\n\n8\n00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:23.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n9\n00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:26.052\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But as you can see,\n\n10\n00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:29.324\nwe have Mrs Jo Peacock,\nback in studios with us today,\n\n11\n00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:31.831\nbecause we kinda left you hanging there.\n\n12\n00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:35.530\nWe started going through our\ndifferent parts, but we got to what,\n\n13\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.057\nPart 2 in that first show?\n\n14\n00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:39.965\n&gt;&gt; Yep we did,\nwe took a look at Part 1 and Part 2, and\n\n15\n00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:44.843\nnow in this particular show we're going\nto, in this particular episode we're going\n\n16\n00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:48.670\nto look a little bit more at\nthe service management system.\n\n17\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.580\nAnd we're going to look at the\nPlan–Do–Check–Act methodology sometimes\n\n18\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.258\nknown as the Deming Cycle.\n\n19\n00:00:55.258 --> 00:00:58.118\nSo we're just gonna put into\na little bit more context and\n\n20\n00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:01.882\nalso put it into context with some\nother international standards as well.\n\n21\n00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:05.021\n&gt;&gt; Okay cool so,\nwe're gonna be picking up here Part 2?\n\n22\n00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:07.790\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we're picking up\nexactly where we left off.\n\n23\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.508\nWhere we left off we just finished,\nwe looked at Par 1 which were the Shalls,\n\n24\n00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:17.164\nthese were the mandatory requirements,\n259 mandatory requirements.\n\n25\n00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:21.733\nAnd now in Part 2,\nwe looked at the things that you could do,\n\n26\n00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:26.211\nsort of a guidance, such as the,\nyou should have this, and\n\n27\n00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:30.625\nit will be a good idea if you\nhad it implemented in this way.\n\n28\n00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:35.377\nAnd now what we're going to take a look at\nis we're gonna look at that SMS that we\n\n29\n00:01:35.377 --> 00:01:37.140\ntalked about in the Part 1.\n\n30\n00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.680\nThe SMS is the Service Management System,\nwhich is the way that\n\n31\n00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.720\nwe control all of our services management\nactivities and all of our processes.\n\n32\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.350\nSo, everything that we do\nas a service provider,\n\n33\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.780\nthis is where we set our policies and\nthe management of our services.\n\n34\n00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.590\nNow you'll notice that on this\nright hand side we've got what we\n\n35\n00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.620\ncall the Plan-Do-Check-Act\nto the cycle here.\n\n36\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.710\nThis is also known as the Deming cycle\nas well and it was created initially or\n\n37\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.390\nit was sort out by Deming and\nPlan-Do-Check-Act.\n\n38\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.740\nJust simply is an iterative methodology\nfor the improvement of our services.\n\n39\n00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.871\nSo we will start off by planning\nany new implementations,\n\n40\n00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:24.761\nplanning the improvements,\nthen we implement them.\n\n41\n00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:27.454\nWe check that they've worked, and\n\n42\n00:02:27.454 --> 00:02:32.430\nthen we will identify further\nimprovements in the Act stage.\n\n43\n00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.620\nSo this is where we identify\nthose further improvements.\n\n44\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.184\nThen we plan the improvements,\nwe implement them,\n\n45\n00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:44.371\nwe check that they've worked, and\nthen we identify future improvements.\n\n46\n00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:49.056\nNow in that Act stage,\npart of identifying future improvements\n\n47\n00:02:49.056 --> 00:02:54.260\ncould also be taking,\nit could also mean taking remedial action.\n\n48\n00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.826\nI'm having trouble as well talking now.\n\n49\n00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:57.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n50\n00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.431\n&gt;&gt; It must be contagious.\n\n51\n00:02:59.431 --> 00:03:02.077\nThis is where we also identify and\n\n52\n00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:06.906\nwe might implement any remedial\naction based off the check.\n\n53\n00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:10.684\n&gt;&gt; So, we can see how that down flow\nmaybe affecting the next process and\n\n54\n00:03:10.684 --> 00:03:16.020\nhow it really is cyclic in nature because,\nwe're always trying to improve there.\n\n55\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.710\n&gt;&gt; So, let's say then we planned,\nwe started of with plan,\n\n56\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.130\nare we planned in implementation.\n\n57\n00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.630\nAnd then we implemented it and\n\n58\n00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.570\nwhen in part of check we\nrealized that didn't quite work.\n\n59\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.944\nDidn't quite work exactly how we intended.\n\n60\n00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:36.436\nSo in Acts the improvement that we\nwould identify in that next Act stage,\n\n61\n00:03:36.436 --> 00:03:41.387\nwould actually be to perhaps revert\nback to where we were before,\n\n62\n00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.187\nor it might be to amend or\n\n63\n00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:48.676\ntweak a certain element of\nthe improvement that we just initiated.\n\n64\n00:03:48.676 --> 00:03:55.270\nSo in our ACT, ACT is where we identify\nimprovement opportunities, but ACT is\n\n65\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.630\nalso where we identify those opportunities\nwhere we're improving on the previous\n\n66\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.420\nsituation that might be a remedial\naction from the previous situation.\n\n67\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.990\nSo, don't think it's always\nabout doing something new.\n\n68\n00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.070\nIt might not necessarily be\nabout doing something new.\n\n69\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.554\nIt might actually just be about\ntaking remedial action for\n\n70\n00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:18.941\na failed action for instance.\n\n71\n00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:24.301\nSo why do we mention\nthis point in the class?\n\n72\n00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:28.989\nBecause managing our services and\nour service management\n\n73\n00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:33.780\nsystem has to be base on\na continual method of improvement.\n\n74\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.870\nWe, at no point in time,\nwant to stagnate, we don't.\n\n75\n00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.812\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm finished, and\nthrow in the towel kind of thing.\n\n76\n00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:46.090\n&gt;&gt; Right, an improvement is\nnot just a one off initiative.\n\n77\n00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.963\nIt really isn't and\nmanaging our services, well,\n\n78\n00:04:48.963 --> 00:04:53.485\nit's not something that we just do as a\none off initiative and then we say, right.\n\n79\n00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:56.241\nAs you said that's it, we're done now,\nwe've got everything in place,\n\n80\n00:04:56.241 --> 00:04:58.233\neverything is working great,\nisn't it fantastic?\n\n81\n00:04:58.233 --> 00:04:59.326\n&gt;&gt; That'd be great if it worked like that.\n\n82\n00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:02.208\n&gt;&gt; Now, I can just sit back, right, yeah.\n\n83\n00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:04.921\nNow I can sit back,\nput my feet up, drink my coffee,\n\n84\n00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.662\nand just watch everything working,\nno problem at all yeah, alright.\n\n85\n00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:11.624\n[LAUGH] It doesn't happen like that.\n\n86\n00:05:11.624 --> 00:05:16.087\nWe always need to be in a position\nwhere we can ensure that we meet\n\n87\n00:05:16.087 --> 00:05:18.371\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n88\n00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:22.150\nAnd without referring to cliches, the one\nthing that we know about our business is\n\n89\n00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.922\nthat our business is going to change.\n\n90\n00:05:23.922 --> 00:05:26.840\nNothing ever stays the same\nit really doesn't.\n\n91\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.830\nSo we have to ensure that we are able to\nreact not only to their requirements.\n\n92\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.357\nBut if we're implementing\nsay efficient and\n\n93\n00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:39.884\neffective business relationship management\nthen we're able to identify those\n\n94\n00:05:39.884 --> 00:05:42.362\nrequirements at a very, very early stage.\n\n95\n00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:45.650\nSo a service management system.\n\n96\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.080\nIt's a concept that we will use to,\n\n97\n00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.360\nwell the term is used to describe all\nof the policies that we have in place.\n\n98\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.397\nThe processes that we have in place,\nand all of the tools that will\n\n99\n00:06:01.397 --> 00:06:06.712\nsupport the intuitive and\ncontinual improvement of our services and\n\n100\n00:06:06.712 --> 00:06:10.022\nof our delivery of value to our customers.\n\n101\n00:06:10.022 --> 00:06:12.760\nSo, a service provider, that's us.\n\n102\n00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.580\nAnybody that provides a service\nis a service provider.\n\n103\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.850\nWe've got to ensure\nthat we are continually\n\n104\n00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.930\nimproving our alignment with our\ncustomers and with our organization.\n\n105\n00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.251\nAnd so\nwe'll do that using a Plan-Do-Check-Act.\n\n106\n00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:32.171\nWe always want to continually ensure\nthat the services meet the needs of\n\n107\n00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:34.550\nthe organization.\n\n108\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.930\nSo, service management itself, then.\n\n109\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.690\nIf we take a look at the big\nblue box at the bottom there,\n\n110\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.590\nit's management's responsibility here\n\n111\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.940\nto ensure that we have a service\nmanagement system that contains standards.\n\n112\n00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.283\nAnd that includes standards for\nhow management are going to manage,\n\n113\n00:06:53.283 --> 00:06:57.731\nit include standards for documentation, it\ninclude standards for resource management.\n\n114\n00:06:57.731 --> 00:07:04.993\nIt include standards for how we are going\nto manage our services themselves.\n\n115\n00:07:04.993 --> 00:07:09.438\nAnd our processes too,\nin other words we have to have\n\n116\n00:07:09.438 --> 00:07:14.401\niterative improvement methods in place for\nall of these.\n\n117\n00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:17.310\nSo, what's going to feed into our SMS?\n\n118\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.363\nYou see, our SMS is how we manage.\n\n119\n00:07:20.363 --> 00:07:25.982\nAnd what's going to feed into this, well,\nis the mandatory requirements from 20000.\n\n120\n00:07:25.982 --> 00:07:30.850\nSo 20000 Part 1, ISO 20000 Part 1\ngives us mandatory requirements.\n\n121\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.060\nThese our things that our SMS Has to do.\n\n122\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.436\nISO 20000 Part 2 also gives us the,\n\n123\n00:07:38.436 --> 00:07:43.083\nwell you might want to do\nthis you should do this.\n\n124\n00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:47.770\nSo these aren't the shalls these\nare the good idea, this is the guidance.\n\n125\n00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.380\nSo that could feed into your\nservice management system as well.\n\n126\n00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.624\nThen you've got ISO 9001, now ISO 9001 is\n\n127\n00:07:55.624 --> 00:08:00.171\nthe international standard for\nquality management.\n\n128\n00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:06.036\nAnd that's across an organization, that\nis not just For technical organizations,\n\n129\n00:08:06.036 --> 00:08:10.730\nor for IT service providers,\nthis is across any organization.\n\n130\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.443\nWe see ISO 9001 in place in\na lot of manufacturing plants.\n\n131\n00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:16.203\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep,\nthat's the one we had used for\n\n132\n00:08:16.203 --> 00:08:18.165\nthe company that I had worked for before.\n\n133\n00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:22.115\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, we see that in place\nat a lot of manufacturing plants and\n\n134\n00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:25.345\na lot of the factory environments.\n\n135\n00:08:25.345 --> 00:08:29.831\nThey will tend to have\nISO 9001 implemented.\n\n136\n00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:34.838\nAnd then we've also got ISO/IEC 27002,\n\n137\n00:08:34.838 --> 00:08:40.605\nwhich is the international standard for\nIT security.\n\n138\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.740\nNow, be careful with this one.\n\n139\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.401\nThis has recently been updated.\n\n140\n00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:54.413\nIt used to be ISO 27001, so you may still\nsee some publications refer to ISO 27001,\n\n141\n00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:59.190\nthat is the previous standard for\nIT security management.\n\n142\n00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.434\nNow we have upgraded and\nnow we're on ISO 27002.\n\n143\n00:09:04.434 --> 00:09:07.295\nNow just like anything else within IT,\n\n144\n00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:11.440\nyou never overwrite the previous version,\nright?\n\n145\n00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.325\nAnd so exactly the same with this.\n\n146\n00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:19.470\nWe have ISO 27002, that doesn't\nmean that ISO 27001 is redundant.\n\n147\n00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.870\nUsing the UK version of the word\nredundant, so obsolete, all right?\n\n148\n00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.890\nIt's not obsolete, it just means\nthat we have now a newer version.\n\n149\n00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:34.846\nSo some organizations will\nhave achieved ISO 27001, and\n\n150\n00:09:34.846 --> 00:09:38.640\nsome may have achieved ISO 27002.\n\n151\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.550\nAnd that's okay.\n\n152\n00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.220\nThese are all input into our\nservice management system.\n\n153\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:48.340\nAnd again, the achievement of,\nsay, ISO 27002 or ISO 9001,\n\n154\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:55.620\nthat is a decision that\nthe organization makes.\n\n155\n00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.150\nOr that the IT service provider will\nmake as to whether they want to\n\n156\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.350\nadhere to that standard.\n\n157\n00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.570\nWhether they want to\nachieve those standards.\n\n158\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:08.989\nThat's not something that would\nbe a regulatory requirement.\n\n159\n00:10:08.989 --> 00:10:14.359\nI don't know of any regulatory\nrequirements for ISO 9001.\n\n160\n00:10:14.359 --> 00:10:17.620\nDo you know of any\nregulatory requirements?\n\n161\n00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.596\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think-\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n162\n00:10:21.596 --> 00:10:23.526\nthe most part organization-\n&gt;&gt; I can't remember,\n\n163\n00:10:23.526 --> 00:10:24.850\nbecause I know we worked,\nyeah, there were a lot of.\n\n164\n00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.142\nThe company that we were in,\nwe did some work for the government.\n\n165\n00:10:28.142 --> 00:10:29.809\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that they had their own\n\n166\n00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:31.080\nrequirements there.\n\n167\n00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.067\nSo that's really what I\nthink they were adhering to.\n\n168\n00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:38.052\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and a lot of organizations\nwill use an international standard as\n\n169\n00:10:38.052 --> 00:10:40.410\na market differentiator.\n\n170\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:46.590\nAnd will use that as a sort of a,\nI guess, marketing tool, really.\n\n171\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.970\nWe've achieved this standard.\n\n172\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.310\nThat's it and it is.\n\n173\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly yep, a stamp on the website.\n\n174\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.221\nKind of like, hey, you can trust us\nto do business with us kind of deal.\n\n175\n00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:56.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a market differentiator.\n\n176\n00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.550\nI don't know of any\nparticular industry sector\n\n177\n00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.050\nthat has a specific requirement for\nany of these standards.\n\n178\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.200\nIt's just used as a market differentiator.\n\n179\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.417\nAnd certainly, in terms of ISO 20000 and\n\n180\n00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:16.280\nISO 27002, it's also used as\nan assurance stamp as well.\n\n181\n00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.630\nAssurance to customers that actually\nwe do have security measures in place.\n\n182\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:27.720\nAnd that we do have a certain standard of\ndata management in place, for instance.\n\n183\n00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.910\nSo yes,\nwe use this as a market differentiator.\n\n184\n00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.800\nFor the most part,\n\n185\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.490\nI don't know of any industry sector where\nany of these are mandatory requirements.\n\n186\n00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.980\nHowever, there are mandatory\nrequirements within ISO 20000 and\n\n187\n00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.339\nwithin ISO 27002, and\nof course, within 9001.\n\n188\n00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:50.578\nBecause you don't achieve a standard\nif you don't actually achieve\n\n189\n00:11:50.578 --> 00:11:52.850\nthe requirements, let's face it.\n\n190\n00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:58.000\nSo I've mentioned in previous\nepisodes about ITIL.\n\n191\n00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.630\nLet's not ignore ITIL, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.325\nWe can't ignore ITIL.\n\n193\n00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:08.140\n[LAUGH] And we certainly can't, not in\nterms of ISO 20000, we really can't.\n\n194\n00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.110\nBecause ITIL may help\nus achieve ISO 20000.\n\n195\n00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:18.750\nSo let's take a look at the diagram that\nwe've got in front of us right now, here.\n\n196\n00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.360\nAnd I just want you to see\nhow this builds up, really.\n\n197\n00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.600\nAnd we're gonna start\nfrom the bottom here.\n\n198\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.150\nYou have your own\nproprietary ways of working.\n\n199\n00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:34.378\nThese are your own policies,\nyour own plans, your own processes, etc.\n\n200\n00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:39.216\nNow, the arrows that go between\nyour policies and plans and\n\n201\n00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:41.925\nprocesses and the next level up,\n\n202\n00:12:41.925 --> 00:12:47.465\nwhich are best practices such as ITIL or\nCOBIT or Lean Sigma or CMMI.\n\n203\n00:12:47.465 --> 00:12:52.950\nWell, they're bi-directional, because,\nlet's take ITIL, for instance.\n\n204\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.320\nIt's a best practice framework for\nservice management.\n\n205\n00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:05.250\nAnd you may have implemented a best\npractice framework yourself based on ITIL.\n\n206\n00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.120\nSo you may have implemented\nyour own framework.\n\n207\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.750\nSo in other words, your own policies,\nyour own plans, your own processes and\n\n208\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.990\nprocedures, based on\nthe ITIL best practice.\n\n209\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.897\nYou never, ever implement ITIL.\n\n210\n00:13:20.897 --> 00:13:25.232\nOkay, Six Sigma and\nLean Sigma is something,\n\n211\n00:13:25.232 --> 00:13:30.110\nit's a methodology that\nyou will work within.\n\n212\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.370\nYou want to be as lean\nas you possibly can be.\n\n213\n00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.290\nThis is talking about efficient processes.\n\n214\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:41.340\nCMMI is a method for\nmeasuring process maturity.\n\n215\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:49.000\nSo you will use all of these to develop\nyour own policies, plans, and processes.\n\n216\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.260\nWhich is why these\nare always a bi-directional.\n\n217\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.176\nSo it's your policies and\nprocesses and plans, actually-\n\n218\n00:13:56.176 --> 00:13:57.380\n&gt;&gt; That we're implementing.\n\n219\n00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:02.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, we're implementing\nthose and we are wanting to demonstrate\n\n220\n00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.760\nthat we are working to an efficient\nframework such as ITIL.\n\n221\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.040\nBut that we actually use ITIL and\n\n222\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.053\nwe adapt ITIL to actually provide us with\nour own efficient policies and processes.\n\n223\n00:14:15.053 --> 00:14:20.300\nSo there is no checklist that says,\nif I've got ITIL in place,\n\n224\n00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:25.530\ntherefore I will achieve\nISO 20000 accreditation.\n\n225\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.960\nThat's not necessarily the case,\n\n226\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.080\nit really depends on how you have\nadapted any one of these frameworks.\n\n227\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.060\nAnd so these frameworks will help you,\nand the way that you've adapted\n\n228\n00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.060\nthese frameworks will help\nyou feed into your Part 2.\n\n229\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.010\nAnd your Part 2 is your guidance.\n\n230\n00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.920\nAnd it's how you've\nimplemented the guidance and\n\n231\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.910\nhow you've implemented your frameworks and\nyour methodologies.\n\n232\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:57.195\nThat will then tell you whether\nyou have done it in a way that\n\n233\n00:14:57.195 --> 00:15:01.795\nyou can achieve your Part 1 requirements,\nall of your mandatory requirements.\n\n234\n00:15:01.795 --> 00:15:06.135\nWhich will then tell you whether you\ncan achieve your ISO 20000 audit.\n\n235\n00:15:07.485 --> 00:15:13.890\nSo we assess and\nwe audit against the ISO/IEC 20000-1,\n\n236\n00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:19.356\nin other words,\nthe Part 1 mandatory requirements.\n\n237\n00:15:19.356 --> 00:15:22.682\nBut it's our policies and\nour plans and our processes,\n\n238\n00:15:22.682 --> 00:15:25.314\nthe ones that are within our organization.\n\n239\n00:15:25.314 --> 00:15:28.242\nThey are the ones that will,\n\n240\n00:15:28.242 --> 00:15:33.126\nwell, help us achieve that audit pass,\nokay?\n\n241\n00:15:33.126 --> 00:15:35.250\nOr that audit fail, [LAUGH]?\n\n242\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.790\nIn which case,\nthen it's not really an achievement.\n\n243\n00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.699\nBut it's our policies and it's our\nprocesses that we're actually measuring.\n\n244\n00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:50.112\nSo really just to reiterate\nthe difference between ISO 20000-1\n\n245\n00:15:50.112 --> 00:15:54.513\nin the mandatory requirements and\nITIL, as you can see.\n\n246\n00:15:54.513 --> 00:15:56.714\nAnd I've already said this, so\n\n247\n00:15:56.714 --> 00:16:01.605\nI'm not going to labor this particular\npoint, as you can already see,\n\n248\n00:16:01.605 --> 00:16:06.334\nISO 20000 Is a standard that we\nmeasure against an ITIL, well,\n\n249\n00:16:06.334 --> 00:16:12.452\nwe will implement an ITIL-based framework,\nit's a set of best practice guidelines.\n\n250\n00:16:12.452 --> 00:16:17.256\nAnd so ITIL has referenced\nto a management system,\n\n251\n00:16:17.256 --> 00:16:20.730\nit has reference to policies, etc.\n\n252\n00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.073\nWhereas, here within ISO 20000-1 part one,\n\n253\n00:16:25.073 --> 00:16:30.865\nwe actually specifically mention that\nwe have to have requirements for\n\n254\n00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:35.260\na management system,\nincluding the processes.\n\n255\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.715\nAnd the management system also\nincludes policies, etc., as well.\n\n256\n00:16:39.715 --> 00:16:43.790\nThey also use Plan-Do-Check-Act in\nboth ITIL, which we use in CSI.\n\n257\n00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:49.030\nAnd continual service improvement but\nit is actually used within\n\n258\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.820\nISO 20000 as a basis for\nimproving all of our services.\n\n259\n00:16:56.026 --> 00:17:02.972\nISO 20000 doesn't specify requirements for\ngovernance of IT.\n\n260\n00:17:02.972 --> 00:17:06.608\nISO 20,000 will just\nspecify requirements for\n\n261\n00:17:06.608 --> 00:17:11.534\nthe management of IT, and we actually\nhave an international standard,\n\n262\n00:17:11.534 --> 00:17:16.320\nwhich is 38,500, which is a standard for\nthe governance of IT.\n\n263\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.430\nAnd that is governance at a senior level,\nokay?\n\n264\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:28.404\nThat's about setting direction and that's\nabout setting strategic policies, etc.\n\n265\n00:17:28.404 --> 00:17:33.428\nNow, we can also use, and I have also\nbeen in organizations where COBIT is\n\n266\n00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:39.870\nused as a governance framework for, and as\nsomething that we want to adhere to again.\n\n267\n00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:46.536\nAs an audit that you can have for\na strategy and for a governance within IT.\n\n268\n00:17:46.536 --> 00:17:51.440\nAnd in fact COBIT came from\nthe financial industry.\n\n269\n00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.320\nAnd I know of a lot of financial\norganizations that actually undertake\n\n270\n00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.365\non a regular basis COBIT audits and\ntherefore are looking for\n\n271\n00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:06.648\nIT to support those COBIT audits for\ngovernance over IT.\n\n272\n00:18:06.648 --> 00:18:13.568\nSo how does ISO 20000 and\nthen ITIL feed into this?\n\n273\n00:18:13.568 --> 00:18:17.834\nWell, if we were to take a look\nback if we were to go back to this\n\n274\n00:18:17.834 --> 00:18:22.859\nparticular diagram, the way that\nthis would work is, as you'll see,\n\n275\n00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:27.800\nour policies, well, they will\nactually allow us to achieve COBIT.\n\n276\n00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.720\nIt's the way that we work that\nallows us to achieve a COBIT audit.\n\n277\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.945\nIt's the way that we work if we work in\na way that is efficient and effective.\n\n278\n00:18:36.945 --> 00:18:40.145\nIf we implement ITIL in\na way that is efficient and\n\n279\n00:18:40.145 --> 00:18:44.830\neffective, then that could help us\nachieve a COBIT audit in the same way\n\n280\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.893\nas it could help us achieve ISO 20,000.\n\n281\n00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:50.860\nBut only if we implement it correctly.\n\n282\n00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:55.634\nSo there's a lot of relationships\nbetween ISO 20,000 and\n\n283\n00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:58.570\nother international standards as well.\n\n284\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.150\nIn other words, what we're saying is\nthat we don't do this in isolation.\n\n285\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:09.840\nWe will try, and\nI know that it's really, the temptation\n\n286\n00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.720\nhere within IT to try and pigeonhole\nevery single activity that we do.\n\n287\n00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.580\nAnd to try and undertake a lot\nof activities in isolation.\n\n288\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.480\nAnd we're simply turning round and telling\nyou that it's not a good idea to do that,\n\n289\n00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.990\nyou have to think about\nthe organization as a whole.\n\n290\n00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.366\nYou have to think about whether the\norganization wants to achieve ISO 9000,\n\n291\n00:19:29.366 --> 00:19:32.659\nwhether the organization\nwants to achieve ISO 27002.\n\n292\n00:19:32.659 --> 00:19:35.459\nYou have to think about\nwhether we want to try and\n\n293\n00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:38.930\nachieve ISO 38500 or\neven COBIT, for that matter.\n\n294\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:43.042\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting\nthat you point that out, Jo.\n\n295\n00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:47.578\nBecause I've even seen this in very mature\norganizations that you would think have\n\n296\n00:19:47.578 --> 00:19:50.480\nalready overcame this\nkind of silo mentality.\n\n297\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.210\nBut it can creep up on you very easily.\n\n298\n00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.816\n&gt;&gt; I'll be perfectly honest with you,\nokay, I'm gonna be really honest, here.\n\n299\n00:19:57.816 --> 00:19:59.402\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No!\n\n300\n00:19:59.402 --> 00:20:01.803\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I know, I know,\nthis is never a good thing.\n\n301\n00:20:01.803 --> 00:20:04.740\nI get fed up with it, I really,\nreally do get fed up with it.\n\n302\n00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.080\nIt kinda disheartens me in a lot of ways.\n\n303\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.920\nWhen you walk into an organization and\nyou see a lack of collaboration in there.\n\n304\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:19.620\nBecause you can implement a framework, you\ncan even achieve ISO 20000 in isolation,\n\n305\n00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.500\nbut it's not gonna be\nvery easy to maintain.\n\n306\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.920\nIt's not going to be very\neasy to demonstrate value.\n\n307\n00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.964\n&gt;&gt; Or just,\neasy to do your day-to-day tasks.\n\n308\n00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:36.356\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, the mentality of sort\nof empire building, as we call it,\n\n309\n00:20:36.356 --> 00:20:40.028\nwhere everybody tries to keep\nto their own little silos, and\n\n310\n00:20:40.028 --> 00:20:43.880\neverybody tries to keep to keep\nto their own sort of specialty.\n\n311\n00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.005\nYeah, it doesn't make for\nvery good teamwork.\n\n312\n00:20:46.005 --> 00:20:48.750\nAnd ultimately it doesn't\nhelp the business.\n\n313\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.151\nIt doesn't help\nthe organization as a whole.\n\n314\n00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:56.108\nIf there are elements within our service\nprovider or organization where we're\n\n315\n00:20:56.108 --> 00:21:00.350\nworking in silence, it really doesn't\nhelp to deliver value to the business.\n\n316\n00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.670\nBut let me give you an example.\n\n317\n00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.870\nI worked with a very, very large,\na multinational organization,\n\n318\n00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.127\nI'm not gonna give away\ntoo much more information.\n\n319\n00:21:09.127 --> 00:21:09.948\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n320\n00:21:09.948 --> 00:21:15.073\n&gt;&gt; But I worked with a large\nmultinational organization and\n\n321\n00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:18.274\nthe sales team at one point in time,\n\n322\n00:21:18.274 --> 00:21:23.230\ncame to IT and they said to IT,\nhey we want iPads.\n\n323\n00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.700\nAnd this was the specific requirement.\n\n324\n00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.680\nNow, there are lots of\nissues in that in itself,\n\n325\n00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.860\nbecause if the sales team had come\ninto IT and said we want iPads,\n\n326\n00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.690\nthat tells me that business relationship\nmanagement is not doing its job.\n\n327\n00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.713\nBecause business relationship management\nshould have actually picked this up.\n\n328\n00:21:38.713 --> 00:21:39.216\n&gt;&gt; Identified the need.\n\n329\n00:21:39.216 --> 00:21:40.737\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, way before they came to IT.\n\n330\n00:21:40.737 --> 00:21:45.534\nAnd basically, they gave IT a bit of\nan ultimatum and they said to IT,\n\n331\n00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:48.759\nwe want iPads and\nif you don't give them to us,\n\n332\n00:21:48.759 --> 00:21:53.510\nbecause we're sales people and\nwe're out on the road all the time.\n\n333\n00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:58.532\nAnd if you don't give them to us\nwe're gonna go down to a store and\n\n334\n00:21:58.532 --> 00:22:03.368\nwe're gonna buy 500 iPads from\na particular store because\n\n335\n00:22:03.368 --> 00:22:07.925\nour sales guys want them and\nthey need them to do their job.\n\n336\n00:22:07.925 --> 00:22:15.260\nIT I wouldn't say panicked, but certainly\nIT reacted in a knee jerk reaction.\n\n337\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.378\nAnd IT said okay, then, no problem at all,\neven though they didn't\n\n338\n00:22:19.378 --> 00:22:23.218\nhave the infrastructure in place\nto be able to implement iPads.\n\n339\n00:22:23.218 --> 00:22:27.364\nThey didn't have the people in place\nto be able to support them, nor\n\n340\n00:22:27.364 --> 00:22:30.060\nany of the apps written at all.\n\n341\n00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.918\nFor these sales guys to use, but\nnevertheless they bow to pressure,\n\n342\n00:22:34.918 --> 00:22:37.029\nand they implemented iPads.\n\n343\n00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:41.645\nThey rolled out iPads, because quite\nsimply they'd been given pressure\n\n344\n00:22:41.645 --> 00:22:45.530\nfrom the sales guys,\na completely different business unit.\n\n345\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:51.140\nIn the same country I have to say, but\na completely different business unit had\n\n346\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:58.300\nbeen evaluating mobile solutions, for\nabout eight months prior to this.\n\n347\n00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.738\nAnd there was no collaboration whatsoever.\n\n348\n00:23:03.738 --> 00:23:08.963\nAnd because of this, you ended up\nwith a multinational organization\n\n349\n00:23:08.963 --> 00:23:13.916\nwith two different sales teams,\ntwo different business units,\n\n350\n00:23:13.916 --> 00:23:19.920\nusing two different mobile solutions\nwith no collaboration between them.\n\n351\n00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:26.260\nNo synergy at all, and\nimagine the nightmare of administration.\n\n352\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.291\nWhen you're talking about\nadministering the infrastructure,\n\n353\n00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:31.970\nyou're talking about trying to-\n&gt;&gt; Trying to integrate\n\n354\n00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.616\nthose two disparate systems.\n\n355\n00:23:33.616 --> 00:23:37.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're trying to, I mean, and\n\n356\n00:23:37.036 --> 00:23:42.540\nit's not just sort of integrating\ndisparate technology.\n\n357\n00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.111\nIt's also about the fact that\nyou're talking about the different\n\n358\n00:23:47.111 --> 00:23:52.174\noperating systems and the different\nrequirements in terms of backups and\n\n359\n00:23:52.174 --> 00:23:53.817\nin terms of all of this.\n\n360\n00:23:53.817 --> 00:24:00.938\nAnd we had, in this global organization,\nwhere they had a couple of data centers,\n\n361\n00:24:00.938 --> 00:24:06.959\nand You had one data center trying\nto manage both types of technology.\n\n362\n00:24:06.959 --> 00:24:10.660\nThere was so\nmuch duplication involved in that as well.\n\n363\n00:24:13.028 --> 00:24:15.434\nIf I look at this in terms of ISO 20000,\n\n364\n00:24:15.434 --> 00:24:18.565\nwould that organization\nhave achieved ISO 20000?\n\n365\n00:24:18.565 --> 00:24:19.880\nAbsolutely not.\n\n366\n00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.270\nBecause working in a siloed mentality,\nwell,\n\n367\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.115\nwhat them meant was they were\noperating across purposes.\n\n368\n00:24:28.115 --> 00:24:30.680\nBecause you had one person going\noff in this direction, and\n\n369\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.000\none business unit going in this direction.\n\n370\n00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.970\nSo as an organization they\nwouldn't have achieved ISO 20000.\n\n371\n00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:43.293\nHowever, as independent business units,\nIT business units.\n\n372\n00:24:43.293 --> 00:24:47.850\nSo as independent IT units, they were\n\n373\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:52.790\npossibly on a very good path to\nachieving ISO 20000, independently.\n\n374\n00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.610\nUntil it came to the point where we\nmeasure the value that's delivered\n\n375\n00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.580\nto the organization, as a whole.\n\n376\n00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.110\nAnd we say, are you delivering\nvalue to your organization?\n\n377\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:08.243\nYes, you're delivering value to\nyour independent business unit, but\n\n378\n00:25:08.243 --> 00:25:11.033\nto the organization as a whole,\nno you're not.\n\n379\n00:25:11.033 --> 00:25:16.020\nBecause working in silo is not\ngoing to deliver overall value.\n\n380\n00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:20.518\nAnd so, it happens in the real world,\ntoo often.\n\n381\n00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:24.080\nIt kinda makes me sad [LAUGH],\nbut it does happen.\n\n382\n00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.140\nAnd so we have to get away from that\nmentality of not talking to each other.\n\n383\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.090\nWhich is why we will\ntalk about implementing\n\n384\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.970\nportfolio management, and implementing\nbusiness relationship management,\n\n385\n00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.400\nand actually having that\ncollaboration here, within IT.\n\n386\n00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.560\nOne of the things that I\nreally really like about\n\n387\n00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.240\nservice management frameworks as a whole.\n\n388\n00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:54.550\nAnd about the International Standard here\nISO 20000, is that with both ISO 20000 and\n\n389\n00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:59.760\nwith ISO 27002 as well, we have\n\n390\n00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.720\na number of what we would\ncall related publications.\n\n391\n00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.351\nWe have a number of complementary\npublications that are out there in the big\n\n392\n00:26:10.351 --> 00:26:12.863\nwide world, that can help us with this.\n\n393\n00:26:12.863 --> 00:26:17.487\nWe've got guides to ISO 20000-1.\n\n394\n00:26:17.487 --> 00:26:20.245\nWe've got guides to\nservice management itself,\n\n395\n00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:25.172\nwe've got self-assessment workbooks, etc.,\nthat are available out there in the big\n\n396\n00:26:25.172 --> 00:26:28.670\nwide world,\nthat can help us achieve all of this.\n\n397\n00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.310\nThere's also ITIL, and\nITIL as a service management framework,\n\n398\n00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.370\nthat will help us achieve.\n\n399\n00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.280\nNone of these we guarantee by the way,\n\n400\n00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.120\nthat you're going to achieve\nISO 20000 certification.\n\n401\n00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.440\nBut they're all going to help,\nalong with other frameworks,\n\n402\n00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.270\nsuch as COBIT, and CMMI,\nand project management too.\n\n403\n00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.331\n&gt;&gt; So these are all just a small search\naway, small Internet search away from us?\n\n404\n00:26:52.331 --> 00:26:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, yeah, and all of this\nis available at our fingertips.\n\n405\n00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.055\nWe don't leave you sort of\nflaming around in the dark,\n\n406\n00:26:59.055 --> 00:27:02.530\n[LAUGH] we want to help you achieve this.\n\n407\n00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.860\nBut we have to make sure that\nwe maintain the standard.\n\n408\n00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.160\nSo we know that the standard is\nquite difficult to maintain.\n\n409\n00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.570\nSo we wanna help you, but\n\n410\n00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.270\nwe also want to ensure that it\nis kept as a standard as well.\n\n411\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:21.634\nSo in terms of part one, then in terms\nof international standard itself,\n\n412\n00:27:21.634 --> 00:27:24.335\nthis is what part one like looks like.\n\n413\n00:27:24.335 --> 00:27:26.623\nThese are the contents of part one.\n\n414\n00:27:26.623 --> 00:27:31.168\nAnd the contents of part one talk about\nour scope, and our references, and\n\n415\n00:27:31.168 --> 00:27:33.235\nour terms and definitions.\n\n416\n00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:37.595\nWe look in clause four,\nat the service management system, and\n\n417\n00:27:37.595 --> 00:27:41.615\nwhat the management responsibility is,\nand how we govern processes.\n\n418\n00:27:41.615 --> 00:27:46.765\nIn clause five, we look at how we\ndesign and transition our new services.\n\n419\n00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:50.265\nAnd then in clause six,\nwe look at our delivery processes,\n\n420\n00:27:50.265 --> 00:27:54.710\nsuch as service level management,\nand reporting, and continuity.\n\n421\n00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.010\nIn clause seven,\nwe look at relationship processes.\n\n422\n00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.070\nIn clause eight,\nwe look at resolution processes.\n\n423\n00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.500\nAnd in clause nine,\nwe look at control processes.\n\n424\n00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.150\nNow, a few things that\nI want to point out on\n\n425\n00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.700\nthis particular slide that's\nin front of us right now.\n\n426\n00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.160\nThere are some things that look very\nvery similar to those of you that have\n\n427\n00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.920\ncompleted an ITIL class, there are some\nthings that look incredibly similar.\n\n428\n00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.050\nBut you'll notice that in our\nservice delivery processes,\n\n429\n00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:28.060\nreporting is actually a process,\nand certainly not in ITIL.\n\n430\n00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.560\nYou'll notice that in our\nresolution processes,\n\n431\n00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.300\nservice request management is in there.\n\n432\n00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.400\nAnd yet, hang on, didn't we have\na request fulfillment in ITIL?\n\n433\n00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.570\nIt's called something\ncompletely different,\n\n434\n00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.560\nbecause we're resolving a request.\n\n435\n00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.235\nSo be careful, be very very careful.\n\n436\n00:28:46.235 --> 00:28:51.500\nAnd I know that I've said this\nbefore in previous episodes,\n\n437\n00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:57.385\nbut be very careful about\nthe understanding of bringing in terms and\n\n438\n00:28:57.385 --> 00:29:01.326\ndefinitions from ITIL into ISO 20000.\n\n439\n00:29:01.326 --> 00:29:02.670\nThat's something that we don't wanna do.\n\n440\n00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.890\nWe don't want to confuse that, okay.\n\n441\n00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:10.418\nLet's take a look, then,\nat some terms and definitions,\n\n442\n00:29:10.418 --> 00:29:14.867\nvery briefly,\nthat are associated with ISO 20000.\n\n443\n00:29:14.867 --> 00:29:16.818\nA service provider is somebody,\n\n444\n00:29:16.818 --> 00:29:20.099\nan organization that delivers\nservices to customers.\n\n445\n00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.646\nNow, look at the definition of a service,\nand\n\n446\n00:29:23.646 --> 00:29:26.087\ncompare that to the definition\nof an ITIL service.\n\n447\n00:29:26.087 --> 00:29:31.288\nThe definition of a service here within\nISO 20000 is a means of delivering value\n\n448\n00:29:31.288 --> 00:29:36.210\nfor a customer, by facilitating the\nresults that a customer wants to achieve.\n\n449\n00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.260\nVery similar to the ITIL definition\nof a service, but not quite the same.\n\n450\n00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.880\nAnd then we have a service component,\nwhich is a unit of a service.\n\n451\n00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.080\nThat when combined with our other units,\ndeliver a complete service.\n\n452\n00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.170\nYou might have called that\na configuration item in ITIL.\n\n453\n00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.930\nAnd then we've got an interested party.\n\n454\n00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:01.780\nAnd an interested party is what we might\nhave called a stakeholder, within ITIL.\n\n455\n00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.450\nBut in interested parties, anybody that is\ninterested, in either the performance or\n\n456\n00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:10.590\nthe success of service\nprovider activities.\n\n457\n00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.190\nSo think about who our\ninterested parties might be.\n\n458\n00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.060\nOur interested parties,\nto us, could be customers or\n\n459\n00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.830\ninternal, groups, or suppliers, or\na customer who is acting as a supplier.\n\n460\n00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:29.747\nMaybe think about shared services\nin this particular instance.\n\n461\n00:30:29.747 --> 00:30:31.257\nLet's think about HR.\n\n462\n00:30:31.257 --> 00:30:36.270\nHR is a customer of ours in IT, but\nthey also act as a supplier to us as well.\n\n463\n00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:41.430\nBecause they give us information in\nterms of security profiling, for\n\n464\n00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.060\ninstance, for our users.\n\n465\n00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.210\nAnd then, of course, we have our users.\n\n466\n00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.600\nNow, Cherokee,\nI'm gonna ask you a question right now.\n\n467\n00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:52.657\nDo you remember what the difference\nbetween a customer and a user is?\n\n468\n00:30:52.657 --> 00:30:53.532\n&gt;&gt; I do, Jo.\n\n469\n00:30:53.532 --> 00:30:54.408\n&gt;&gt; Woo!\n\n470\n00:30:54.408 --> 00:30:55.328\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\n\n471\n00:30:55.328 --> 00:30:58.364\nwould you like to [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n472\n00:30:58.364 --> 00:30:59.324\nOkay, come on tell me.\n\n473\n00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:03.185\n&gt;&gt; So your customer,\nlet's start with a customer, so\n\n474\n00:31:03.185 --> 00:31:08.210\nyour customer is going to be someone\nwho is paying for this service.\n\n475\n00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:13.573\nWhereas your user may be someone\nwho is accessing a free trial,\n\n476\n00:31:13.573 --> 00:31:16.820\nor the customer has paid for the user.\n\n477\n00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:23.830\nSo like maybe, if my company was paying\nfor my training here at ITProTV.\n\n478\n00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.850\nSo the company could be the customer,\n\n479\n00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.010\nwhereas the employee,\nme, I would be the user.\n\n480\n00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.579\nSo?\n\n481\n00:31:30.579 --> 00:31:32.031\n&gt;&gt; We got there.\n\n482\n00:31:32.031 --> 00:31:32.982\n&gt;&gt; You got there.\n\n483\n00:31:32.982 --> 00:31:34.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got there.\n&gt;&gt; A long way there,\n\n484\n00:31:34.796 --> 00:31:35.830\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] yeah,\n\n485\n00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.760\na customer is somebody who pays.\n\n486\n00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.078\nThink of a call center manager,\n\n487\n00:31:39.078 --> 00:31:43.740\nthey're a customer, and\na user is somebody who uses the service.\n\n488\n00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.580\nSimple as that.\n\n489\n00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.450\nThey could be one and the same thing.\n\n490\n00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:50.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be a user that is also\na customer, I pay for it independently.\n\n491\n00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.790\n&gt;&gt; It's not about independently,\nbut all customers are users.\n\n492\n00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.369\nEven all call center managers\nwill still use the service.\n\n493\n00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.570\nSo customers could still be users.\n\n494\n00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.548\nCustomers could be somebody senior,\n\n495\n00:32:02.548 --> 00:32:05.343\nwho don't necessarily use\nthe service themselves.\n\n496\n00:32:05.343 --> 00:32:06.751\n&gt;&gt; Not user, just customer.\n\n497\n00:32:06.751 --> 00:32:08.416\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always like to\nthink about Starbucks right-\n\n498\n00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:10.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n499\n00:32:10.112 --> 00:32:11.538\n&gt;&gt; At this point in time.\n\n500\n00:32:11.538 --> 00:32:13.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good analogy\nthat you shared before.\n\n501\n00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI always like to think about Starbucks.\n\n502\n00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.980\nIf I were to take you into Starbucks and\n\n503\n00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.060\nbuy you a drink, then I would be\nthe customer, and you would be the user.\n\n504\n00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:29.669\nWhat I'm concerned about as\na customer is that that cup's full.\n\n505\n00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:31.650\nI wanna get value for money.\n\n506\n00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.521\nWhat you're concerned about as a user is?\n\n507\n00:32:34.521 --> 00:32:35.342\n&gt;&gt; Delicious.\n\n508\n00:32:35.342 --> 00:32:36.416\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she wants it to taste good.\n\n509\n00:32:36.416 --> 00:32:39.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's gonna influence me.\n\n510\n00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:44.490\nBecause if she doesn't like it as a user,\nthe next time I say come on, let's go for\n\n511\n00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.130\na coffee, you're gonna?\n\n512\n00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.077\n&gt;&gt; We're going to Opus.\n\n513\n00:32:47.077 --> 00:32:48.709\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're going somewhere else.\n\n514\n00:32:48.709 --> 00:32:52.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so users influence customers.\n\n515\n00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:57.010\nBut I could also be a user as well, cuz I\ncould actually buy a coffee, not just for\n\n516\n00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.500\nCherokee, but I could get myself one too.\n\n517\n00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.090\nIn which case then I'm fulfilling a role\nof both the customer and the user.\n\n518\n00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:03.890\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n519\n00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.587\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so customers and\nusers, they are different.\n\n520\n00:33:07.587 --> 00:33:11.413\nAnd it's at this point in time,\nwhere I think it's appropriate for\n\n521\n00:33:11.413 --> 00:33:12.493\nus to take a break.\n\n522\n00:33:12.493 --> 00:33:14.979\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a good idea Jo, but-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I want coffee.\n\n523\n00:33:14.979 --> 00:33:16.248\nI don't know about anybody else.\n\n524\n00:33:16.248 --> 00:33:18.349\n&gt;&gt; I know, you got us thinking\nabout all this coffee now.\n\n525\n00:33:18.349 --> 00:33:20.833\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we're not quite finished yet Jo.\n\n526\n00:33:20.833 --> 00:33:23.781\nSo thank you for sharing that\ninformation with us, and thank you for\n\n527\n00:33:23.781 --> 00:33:25.040\nbeing here as well.\n\n528\n00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.040\nBut stay tuned we have\nmore headed your way.\n\n529\n00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.630\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n530\n00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:29.960\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n531\n00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n532\n00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.202\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n533\n00:33:33.202 --> 00:33:39.047\n[MUSIC]\n\n534\n00:33:39.047 --> 00:33:42.418\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.298\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.298 --> 00:00:13.611\n&gt;&gt; You're watching, ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and gentlemen\n\n5\n00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:21.300\nto your ISO/IEC 20000:2011 Foundation\nseries I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.920\nIn this episode, we'll continue with the\npart three, where we examine the overview.\n\n7\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.100\nAnd here, back in studios with us today,\nwe have expert, Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.973\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n9\n00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:32.817\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great,\nhow are you, Cherokee?\n\n10\n00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:35.135\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing lovely, thank you for asking.\n\n11\n00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:38.622\nSo I know we've already covered\ninformation in a part one and a part two.\n\n12\n00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:40.264\nWhat could be left?\n\n13\n00:00:40.264 --> 00:00:46.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we're just gonna carry on with\njust our overview really of ISO 20000.\n\n14\n00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.399\nI call it ISO 20000 by the way,\n\n15\n00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.850\nit makes it a lot easier than ISO\nstroke IEC 20000 2011, all right?\n\n16\n00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.023\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'll get this eventually guys.\n\n17\n00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:59.483\n&gt;&gt; You noticed how I always\nleave you the with the long.\n\n18\n00:00:59.483 --> 00:01:00.900\n&gt;&gt; The job, yeah, that's okay.\n\n19\n00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.240\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, I'm happy with that.\n\n20\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.900\nSo we're just gonna carry on\nwith the Overview of ISO 20000.\n\n21\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.170\nWe're going to look at\na sample scope of an audit,\n\n22\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.030\nand we're also then going to just look\nat the accreditation process, itself.\n\n23\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.470\nSo just a very, very brief overview, but\n\n24\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.510\nwe'll just carry on\nreally where we left off.\n\n25\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.544\nAs you already said, this is a part three.\n\n26\n00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:27.500\nSo let's launch straight into this.\n\n27\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.230\nAnd the first thing that I want\nto talk to you about really,\n\n28\n00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.610\nis the fact that we already touched on\nthis in the last, in our last episode.\n\n29\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.014\nWhen we talked about working in that\nsiloed mentality, if you remember.\n\n30\n00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:45.289\nWell, what we want to do is make sure\nthat we have a defined scope for\n\n31\n00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.640\nour audit itself, or our assessment\nagainst the ISO 20000 standard.\n\n32\n00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.206\nBecause you can actually work in silos,\nyou can audit in silos.\n\n33\n00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:59.726\nYou could audit within,\nif you are a service provider for\n\n34\n00:01:59.726 --> 00:02:01.424\na specific business unit.\n\n35\n00:02:01.424 --> 00:02:06.017\nYou could audit just on that one\nparticular service provider for\n\n36\n00:02:06.017 --> 00:02:08.800\nthat individual business unit.\n\n37\n00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.320\nOr you could audit on the entire IT\nservice provider organization in itself.\n\n38\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.739\nWhy is that so important?\n\n39\n00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.325\nWell, the reason why this is\nparticularly important is because for\n\n40\n00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:24.160\nlarge organization.\n\n41\n00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.280\nThe larger the scale of the organization,\nin other words the bigger the organization\n\n42\n00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.400\nis, the more likely you\nwant to want to try and\n\n43\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.860\naudit certain parts of your\nservice provider organization.\n\n44\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.241\nIf you are trying to achieve\nan audit at ISO 20000 for\n\n45\n00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:47.651\nyour whole entire IT service\nprovider organization.\n\n46\n00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:51.819\nBut then, you run the risk of,\nmaybe, it might be too generic, or\n\n47\n00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.880\nmaybe you might be looking\nat certain elements.\n\n48\n00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.850\nCertain mandatory requirements that you\nsimply just can't achieve right away,\n\n49\n00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.030\nacross the board.\n\n50\n00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.160\nYou can achieve certain requirements\nin specific business units,\n\n51\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.280\nbut you can't achieve them\nright away across the board.\n\n52\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.880\nSo there are a number of reasons why\nwe need you to define the scope.\n\n53\n00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.160\nThe scope is not automatically just IT,\nokay?\n\n54\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.427\nThat's your first misconception\nthat I need you to get over,\n\n55\n00:03:22.427 --> 00:03:25.228\nis that you have got to tell the auditor.\n\n56\n00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:30.210\nYou have got to tell\nthe accreditation board what\n\n57\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.010\nit is that you are going to be auditing.\n\n58\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.160\nIn other words, what teams, what processes\nare going to fall under your audit.\n\n59\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.530\nAnd so the first thing that you\nhave to do is define a scope.\n\n60\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.182\nAnd so the scope statement that you define\nhas gotta be agreed with your auditor in\n\n61\n00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:49.805\nadvance.\n\n62\n00:03:49.805 --> 00:03:54.435\nWhen you make an application\nto an accreditation board to\n\n63\n00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:59.070\nundertake an audit,\nan auditor will be assigned to you.\n\n64\n00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.024\nYou will be put in contact with\nan auditor, and it's at that point in time\n\n65\n00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:09.130\nwhere you agree with the auditor\nwhat the scope of the audit will be.\n\n66\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.740\nNow it includes things like the name\nof the organization and the scope.\n\n67\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.910\nWhat services are going to be audited,\nwhat processes,\n\n68\n00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.770\nwhat interfaces are going to be audited.\n\n69\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.520\nIt may also, and\nwe'll definitely advise this, but\n\n70\n00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.750\nit may also include some of the location\nof the actual service provider.\n\n71\n00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.470\nBecause it may be that you want\nto audit one particular location,\n\n72\n00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.440\nbut other geographical locations,\nyou might not want to audit.\n\n73\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.230\nLet's think about those\norganizations where, for instance,\n\n74\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.130\nsecond and third level is done in-house,\nbut maybe our service desk is outsourced.\n\n75\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.800\nAnd our service desk is\noutsourced to another provider,\n\n76\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.420\nwho maybe in a different\ngeographical location.\n\n77\n00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.120\nMaybe around the other side of the world,\nfor instance.\n\n78\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.480\nSo you may want to specify that\nthe scope does not include that.\n\n79\n00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.040\nSo also think about who the customer is.\n\n80\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.950\nYou may want to, if you are auditing for\na specific service, for\n\n81\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.200\na specific customer,\nyou may want to specify that.\n\n82\n00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.699\nYou may even want to specify within your\nscope the technology that you're using.\n\n83\n00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.478\nAny supplier interfaces,\nany interfaces, say, for instance, for\n\n84\n00:05:18.478 --> 00:05:21.397\nexample, that outsourced service desk.\n\n85\n00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:26.996\nThat's an interface that needs to be\ndefined very, very clearly, very clearly.\n\n86\n00:05:26.996 --> 00:05:31.395\nSo that we need to understand what\nthe scope of the audit really entails.\n\n87\n00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:35.319\nIn other words, we need to understand\nwhere we're drawing the line.\n\n88\n00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.805\nAt which point, during that relationship\nbetween your organization and\n\n89\n00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:42.200\nyour service provider organization.\n\n90\n00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.070\nAs in your service desk,\n\n91\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.230\nat which point during that\nrelationship are you drawing the line?\n\n92\n00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.440\nVery similar, for if you are that external\nservice provider organization yourself,\n\n93\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.590\nthen you may be providing\nsort of first line,\n\n94\n00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.720\nsecond line support for\nindividual services.\n\n95\n00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.300\nYou, yourselves may choose\nto be audited for ISO 20000.\n\n96\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.920\nAgain, what is audited is well, it's\n\n97\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.630\nvery important that that's in the scope,\nthe scope that's agreed with your auditor.\n\n98\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:23.040\nBecause otherwise, then some of your\nclients, or some of your clients ways\n\n99\n00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.710\nof working, and some of their processes\nmay interfere with your audit result.\n\n100\n00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.940\nDepending on where you draw those lines,\nthose parameters of responsibility.\n\n101\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.870\nSo those interfaces need to be clear.\n\n102\n00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.010\nAnd if we look at part three of ISO 20000,\n\n103\n00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.480\nwe actually have some\nguidance on scope definition.\n\n104\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.000\nSo you'll notice that I've\nalready mentioned about,\n\n105\n00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.546\nwe've got parts one through to part 11.\n\n106\n00:06:49.546 --> 00:06:54.880\nPart three is the specific guidance\n\n107\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.230\nthat will help us with defining\nthe terms and the scope of any order.\n\n108\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.000\nIt's a very, very important statement.\n\n109\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.652\nAn incredibly important statement,\nand sometimes it's glossed over.\n\n110\n00:07:08.652 --> 00:07:11.770\nAnd sometimes, you just think,\nit's okay, it's just the whole of IT.\n\n111\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.560\nThe problem with being too broad is you\n\n112\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.607\nhave to ensure then that every single\nprocess, and that every single service\n\n113\n00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:26.490\ncan adhere to all of those mandatory\nrequirements that are listed in part one.\n\n114\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.090\nSo a scope could look something like this.\n\n115\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.132\nAnd here, we have just a made up company,\nand I say it could.\n\n116\n00:07:36.132 --> 00:07:40.834\nAnd it could just simply state that\nthe scope of the audit is going to include\n\n117\n00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:45.314\nthe development, and the deployment,\nand the provision of managed IT\n\n118\n00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:50.560\ninfrastructure services to both internal\nand external clients around the world.\n\n119\n00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.561\nAnd services are provided from\nPurple IT North American premises and\n\n120\n00:07:56.561 --> 00:07:58.433\nthis is the address.\n\n121\n00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:04.320\nThis could be what your scope looks like,\nit's very, very, very high level.\n\n122\n00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.840\nIt's detailing, in this particular scope,\nwhat services it's covering,\n\n123\n00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.550\nwhich are the infrastructure services\nto internal and external clients.\n\n124\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.840\nIt's detailing who the clients are, it's\ndetailing what processes it's covering.\n\n125\n00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.250\nIn other words, the development and\ndeployment and the provisions, so\n\n126\n00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.630\nthe operating processes.\n\n127\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:28.760\nIt's also detailing what geographical\nlocation it's covering as well.\n\n128\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:34.143\nSo, all of those are detailed in\nthat particular scope statement.\n\n129\n00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:37.680\nThe scope statement doesn't\nhave to be 150 sentences long.\n\n130\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.180\nIt doesn't have to be\nfive pages in length.\n\n131\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.070\nThe scope statement can be very,\nvery short, but it needs to be explicit.\n\n132\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.910\nThink also about, and\nI’ve already mentioned this,\n\n133\n00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:56.540\nabout our links with our suppliers and\nour external customers as well.\n\n134\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.989\nAnd think about where\nthose parameters lie.\n\n135\n00:08:58.989 --> 00:09:04.223\nAnd what this particular diagram just\nshows us really is at a very high level,\n\n136\n00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:06.840\nthese are where our parameters lie.\n\n137\n00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.834\nSo in the pale blue boxes you'll see that\nwe have business relationship management,\n\n138\n00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:13.940\nsupplier management, and\nservice-level management.\n\n139\n00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.300\nWell, we know that everything\nhere in the service provider,\n\n140\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.950\nwell this is covered by the scope.\n\n141\n00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.757\nBut however,\n\n142\n00:09:20.757 --> 00:09:24.872\nnot all of our relationship with\nthe customers are covered by the scope.\n\n143\n00:09:24.872 --> 00:09:29.129\nAnd certainly not all our relationships\nwith our suppliers are covered by\n\n144\n00:09:29.129 --> 00:09:32.904\nthe scope of the order,\nbecause we cannot be held responsible for\n\n145\n00:09:32.904 --> 00:09:34.840\nthe way that our suppliers work.\n\n146\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.880\nWe most certainly cannot be\naudited on how our suppliers\n\n147\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.120\nmanage their subcontracted suppliers.\n\n148\n00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.670\nWe've got to be incredibly careful.\n\n149\n00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.620\nThe last thing that we want to do,\nif we are looking to achieve\n\n150\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.630\nan ISO 20000 accreditation or\ncertification, the last\n\n151\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:10:00.050\nthing that we want to do is\nto fail any accreditation\n\n152\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.305\noff the fact that, somewhere here\nin our supply of management.\n\n153\n00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:08.310\nWhere somewhere here in\nour third parties and\n\n154\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:13.170\nour suppliers, they've done something\nthat would cause us to fail.\n\n155\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.095\n&gt;&gt; Right, and like we had spoke about\nbefore, sometimes you'll have additional\n\n156\n00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:20.435\ncompliances or regulatory bodies\nthat may specify otherwise.\n\n157\n00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:24.018\nAlthough, we're not seeing that here,\nit may be in place elsewhere.\n\n158\n00:10:24.018 --> 00:10:28.700\n&gt;&gt; For the most part, I will be perfectly\nhonest, and ISO 20000 integrates very,\n\n159\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.471\nvery well with other international\nstandards, with ISO 9000,\n\n160\n00:10:32.471 --> 00:10:34.116\nthe one with ISO 27002.\n\n161\n00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:36.918\nThere's some very good integration there.\n\n162\n00:10:36.918 --> 00:10:38.256\nBut nevertheless,\n\n163\n00:10:38.256 --> 00:10:43.213\nthe last thing that you want is anything\nthat a supplier is doing or anything\n\n164\n00:10:43.213 --> 00:10:48.720\nthat a customer is doing to influence\nyour ability to achieve accreditation.\n\n165\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.560\nWe're talking about official\naccreditation here.\n\n166\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.812\nWe're talking about something that is\ngiven to you, and because you have regular\n\n167\n00:10:56.812 --> 00:11:01.548\naudits going forward, it's something\nthat could be taken away as well.\n\n168\n00:11:01.548 --> 00:11:04.353\nAnd the last thing that you need as\na service provider is to achieve\n\n169\n00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:07.060\naccreditation and then to lose\naccreditation at a later date.\n\n170\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.794\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be pretty devastating.\n\n171\n00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:09.587\n&gt;&gt; Right, it would.\n\n172\n00:11:09.587 --> 00:11:11.880\nYeah, we certainly don't want to do that.\n\n173\n00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.310\nSo, we wanna make sure that all of our\ninterfaces, well, that they're covered.\n\n174\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.248\nAnd in other words, that we've got\nthe scope defined correctly so\n\n175\n00:11:19.248 --> 00:11:22.200\nthat we know what's being covered and\nwhat's not being covered.\n\n176\n00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.190\nOkay, so now we've defined our scope.\n\n177\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:31.320\nLet's take a look at the other sections\nthat we've got in part one that we\n\n178\n00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.540\nactually need to define because this is\nwhat we're going to be audited against.\n\n179\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.631\nNow, you'll notice that we got\nnormative references in there, and\n\n180\n00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:40.829\nwe've also got terms and\ndefinitions in there.\n\n181\n00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:44.549\nSo we need to ensure that we're very,\nvery explicit about the terms and\n\n182\n00:11:44.549 --> 00:11:48.897\nthe definitions that we use, cuz that's\nwhat we're going to be audited against.\n\n183\n00:11:48.897 --> 00:11:53.320\nAnd then clause 4,\nwell that looks at management.\n\n184\n00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.386\nManagement of our IT services and\nmanagement of our IT processes as well.\n\n185\n00:11:57.386 --> 00:12:01.449\nSo clauses 4, well, all of the clauses and\nsubclauses within 4,\n\n186\n00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:05.510\nlook at the service management system and\nhow we're managing IT.\n\n187\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.090\nAnd then clauses 5 through to clauses 9,\n\n188\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:13.076\nthese are our specific\nprocesses themselves.\n\n189\n00:12:13.076 --> 00:12:14.740\nThese are our IT processes.\n\n190\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.710\nAnd so, these contain all of\nthe requirements that we need to have for\n\n191\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:25.500\nall of these processes, including\nevery single one that's listed there.\n\n192\n00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.580\nWe can't leave any of them out.\n\n193\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.110\nThis is all part of our scope.\n\n194\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.580\nThe scope, itself, in section one.\n\n195\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.260\nThat scope, itself,\nrefers specifically to which\n\n196\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.270\npart of your organization\nare you actually auditing?\n\n197\n00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:45.730\nWhereas all of these processes, we're\ngoing to audit all of these processes.\n\n198\n00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.060\nWe're not just gonna say,\nwell, I'll tell you what,\n\n199\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.855\nwe'll skip that mandatory requirement.\n\n200\n00:12:49.855 --> 00:12:53.230\nAnd we'll skip that one,\nand resolution processes,\n\n201\n00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:58.025\nI don't like the look of incident\nmanagement so we're going to skip that.\n\n202\n00:12:58.025 --> 00:12:59.184\nYeah, we can't do that.\n\n203\n00:12:59.184 --> 00:13:01.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just to make sure\nthat I'm totally clear here.\n\n204\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.913\nSo are each one of those 259\ncomponents called clauses?\n\n205\n00:13:06.913 --> 00:13:09.120\n&gt;&gt; These are mandatory requirements.\n\n206\n00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.025\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The clauses,\n\n207\n00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:12.868\nthink of your clauses as\nsections within a book.\n\n208\n00:13:12.868 --> 00:13:14.440\nThink of them as chapters within a book.\n\n209\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.168\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And within each chapter,\n\n210\n00:13:16.168 --> 00:13:20.530\nthere is a certain number of mandatory\nrequirements within each chapter.\n\n211\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.580\nSo for each process, there are a number\nof requirements for each process.\n\n212\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.760\nWithin the actual service\nmanagement system itself,\n\n213\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.390\nthere are a number of requirements\nthat will outline how we\n\n214\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:37.230\nmanagement our IT services and what that\nmanagement looks like, for instance.\n\n215\n00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.867\n&gt;&gt; Okay so if I hop on over to ISO's\nsite and I purchase those 259.\n\n216\n00:13:41.867 --> 00:13:44.676\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The part one,\nwe just call it part one, yeah.\n\n217\n00:13:44.676 --> 00:13:48.206\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's the best way to say\nthat the most intelligent way to speak,\n\n218\n00:13:48.206 --> 00:13:49.000\nall right.\n\n219\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.920\nSo we purchase part one and then we'll see\nall the individual components that way.\n\n220\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we will.\n\n221\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:59.080\nYeah, all of the audit requirements and\neverything is contained in part one.\n\n222\n00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.666\nThink of this as your audit checklist.\n\n223\n00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:06.020\nYou know what I tell everybody to do\nwith a part one, this is your checklist.\n\n224\n00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:10.370\nYou want to get, when you've\ngot a part one in front of you,\n\n225\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.986\nmake yourself a working document.\n\n226\n00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:18.960\nBecause for every single clause,\nthere are a number of requirements.\n\n227\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And for\n\n228\n00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.470\nevery single requirement,\nthat auditor is going to\n\n229\n00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.840\nwant to see documentary evidence\nthat you have met that requirement.\n\n230\n00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.350\nEven everything when it comes to\nthings like incident management.\n\n231\n00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:38.237\nI want to see that not only if have you\ngot incident management in place, but\n\n232\n00:14:38.237 --> 00:14:40.223\nI want to see process documentation.\n\n233\n00:14:40.223 --> 00:14:43.652\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you didn't just think about it,\nyou actually acted on your plan.\n\n234\n00:14:43.652 --> 00:14:46.996\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\nI'm not talking about CMMI,\n\n235\n00:14:46.996 --> 00:14:50.590\nI'm not talking about levels of maturity.\n\n236\n00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.500\nI'm talking about specific\nrequirements for incident management.\n\n237\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.820\nSo I want to see things like that\nyou've got a process owner in place.\n\n238\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.369\nSomebody takes ownership of incident\nmanagement, that you have methods for\n\n239\n00:15:01.369 --> 00:15:03.050\nimproving incident management.\n\n240\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.325\nI want to see the interactions\nbetween incident management and\n\n241\n00:15:06.325 --> 00:15:07.507\nproblem management.\n\n242\n00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:12.820\nAnd I want to see them documented as well,\nand that's just an example.\n\n243\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.540\nBut I want to see all of that, and\nI want to see it in front of me.\n\n244\n00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.095\nI don't just want you to tell me, yeah,\nit's okay, I've got that covered.\n\n245\n00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:23.156\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not gonna get\n\n246\n00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:24.318\nyou through an audit, all right?\n\n247\n00:15:24.318 --> 00:15:25.227\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n[LAUGH]\n\n248\n00:15:25.227 --> 00:15:26.314\n&gt;&gt; Just so you know.\n\n249\n00:15:26.314 --> 00:15:29.880\nSo for all of these particular clauses,\nor think of them as chapters,\n\n250\n00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.890\nif you will, for all of these clauses,\nI wanna see documentary\n\n251\n00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.110\nevidence that you've met all of\nthe requirements within those clauses.\n\n252\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.409\nSo, we've got the show, and\nit says here, again, I mean,\n\n253\n00:15:41.409 --> 00:15:44.641\nthis is just really a repeat\nof what I've already said.\n\n254\n00:15:44.641 --> 00:15:48.228\nWe've got to show evidence\nthat we've met both clause 4,\n\n255\n00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:53.549\nwhich is to do with the service management\nsystem, and also also clauses 5 through 9.\n\n256\n00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:56.995\nAnd it actually says here, and\nI am a bit mean, and I know that.\n\n257\n00:15:56.995 --> 00:15:57.673\nI'm okay.\n\n258\n00:15:57.673 --> 00:15:59.795\nOkay, I'm British,\nI'm all right with this.\n\n259\n00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:04.605\n[LAUGH] But in Clauses 5 to 9,\nwe can demonstrate by showing evidence of\n\n260\n00:16:04.605 --> 00:16:09.416\nfulfilling ALL of the requirements or\nthe MAJORITY of the requirements\n\n261\n00:16:09.416 --> 00:16:14.410\nwith evidence of the governance of\nprocesses operated by other parties.\n\n262\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.068\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:16:16.068 --> 00:16:16.956\n&gt;&gt; Hold on.\n\n264\n00:16:16.956 --> 00:16:17.769\n&gt;&gt; I had to pause there,\n\n265\n00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:20.179\nbecause I just liked the look on\nyour face at that point in time.\n\n266\n00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:23.526\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know there's something tricky\nhe's gonna ask about this, right?\n\n267\n00:16:23.526 --> 00:16:28.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, what this actually means\nis some of these processes you might\n\n268\n00:16:28.148 --> 00:16:30.394\nnot actually manage for yourself.\n\n269\n00:16:30.394 --> 00:16:33.521\nRemember what I said about\noutsourcing incident management?\n\n270\n00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:38.854\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nif I hire someone with the appropriate-\n\n271\n00:16:38.854 --> 00:16:42.074\n&gt;&gt; No, right, you say in here about hiring\n\n272\n00:16:42.074 --> 00:16:44.572\nsomebody with-\n&gt;&gt; Partner.\n\n273\n00:16:44.572 --> 00:16:47.842\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, this is-\n&gt;&gt; With the appropriate credentials or\n\n274\n00:16:47.842 --> 00:16:51.188\ncertifications then\nthat'll help extend my-\n\n275\n00:16:51.188 --> 00:16:54.501\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't think you're quite there.\n\n276\n00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:56.886\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; But what I actually mean is, so\n\n277\n00:16:56.886 --> 00:16:59.832\nif we've outsourced say the service desk.\n\n278\n00:16:59.832 --> 00:17:00.602\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n279\n00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:02.306\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwe've outsourced the service desk.\n\n280\n00:17:02.306 --> 00:17:06.261\nThat means that,\nlet's go back to this particular page,\n\n281\n00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:10.296\nthat means that so in Clause 8,\nIncident management, and\n\n282\n00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:15.640\nmaybe even request management as well,\nis being undertaken by a third party.\n\n283\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.991\nSo I don't have any control\nover a third party.\n\n284\n00:17:19.991 --> 00:17:24.091\nBut in order for me to be able\nto demonstrate, or in order for\n\n285\n00:17:24.091 --> 00:17:30.410\nme to be able to achieve ISO 20000 even,\nI've just gone up to 30,000, why not?\n\n286\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.383\nLet's go for so many.\n\n287\n00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:31.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n288\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:37.388\n&gt;&gt; In order for me to be able to achieve\nISO 20000 I have to demonstrate then,\n\n289\n00:17:37.388 --> 00:17:43.032\nthat I am meeting, right, I am meeting\nthe majority of these requirements all,\n\n290\n00:17:43.032 --> 00:17:46.687\nand now it's disappeared,\nnow what's happened?\n\n291\n00:17:46.687 --> 00:17:49.623\nI'm meeting the majority\nof the requirements,\n\n292\n00:17:49.623 --> 00:17:54.420\nright at the very bottom there, combined\nwith the evidence of the governance or\n\n293\n00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.900\nprocesses operated by that third party,\nthat outsourced service desk.\n\n294\n00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.380\n&gt;&gt; But it's still my responsibility\nto collect that evidence?\n\n295\n00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.463\n&gt;&gt; It's my incident.\n\n296\n00:18:03.463 --> 00:18:05.611\nIt's my incident management, you see, so\n\n297\n00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:08.172\nit's my responsibility to\ncorrect that evidence.\n\n298\n00:18:08.172 --> 00:18:10.163\nOkay, I've given it to somebody else to\n\n299\n00:18:10.163 --> 00:18:10.900\ndo,-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.240\n&gt;&gt; But it's still my incident management.\n\n301\n00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.670\nLet's think about this in\na realistic perspective here.\n\n302\n00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.867\nSo I am the CIO of an IT organization, and\n\n303\n00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:26.185\nI've decided to outsource\nmy service desk to you.\n\n304\n00:18:26.185 --> 00:18:26.994\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n305\n00:18:26.994 --> 00:18:28.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and your organization.\n\n306\n00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.740\nSo you're gonna take responsibility for\nincident management.\n\n307\n00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.140\nBut my contract, as it were, my service\nlevel agreement is with my customers,\n\n308\n00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.190\nwith my business.\n\n309\n00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.530\nIf my customer is telling me, or\n\n310\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.689\nif my customer has got a complaint\nabout incident management, or\n\n311\n00:18:44.689 --> 00:18:48.786\nhas got a complaint about the service\ndesk, who do they come to?\n\n312\n00:18:48.786 --> 00:18:50.990\n&gt;&gt; You, if they don't know\nthat it's being outsourced.\n\n313\n00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.875\n&gt;&gt; Right, they don't know that it's being\noutsourced, so I have that responsibility.\n\n314\n00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:57.480\nActually I have the accountability.\n\n315\n00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.390\nI'm accountable for incident management.\n\n316\n00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:05.530\nThe fact that I've outsourced it to you,\nif you're not performing your role,\n\n317\n00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:08.950\nit's not their fault, and\nthey don't need to know,\n\n318\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.230\nour customers don't need to know this,\nthis is between you and I.\n\n319\n00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.878\nSo if I want to achieve ISO 20000,\n\n320\n00:19:15.878 --> 00:19:21.240\nthen I've got to demonstrate that I've\ngot incident management under control.\n\n321\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.700\nNow, if I put incident management under\ncontrol because I've got a team of my own,\n\n322\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.710\nthat's actually performance incident\nmanagement, then that's great.\n\n323\n00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.180\nBut if I've got incident management under\ncontrol because I've given it to you,\n\n324\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.080\nthen that doesn't matter either.\n\n325\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.550\nI've still got to demonstrate\nthat I've got control over it,\n\n326\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.940\nno matter who's doing it,\nwhether it's your team or\n\n327\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.320\nwhether it's somebody else's team,\nand that's what we mean by that.\n\n328\n00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.660\nWe mean that even if\nit's being outsourced,\n\n329\n00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.880\nyou've still got to demonstrate\nthat it's happening.\n\n330\n00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.610\nSo what could happen,\nif I'm looking to achieve ISO 20000,\n\n331\n00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.510\nif you are nowhere near\nachieving ISO 20000\n\n332\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.790\nyourself, then you could let me down.\n\n333\n00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:09.042\nSimple as that, which is why\nit's in my best interest then,\n\n334\n00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:14.502\nif I'm going to outsource, it's in my best\ninterest to outsource to an organization.\n\n335\n00:20:14.502 --> 00:20:15.623\n&gt;&gt; That's already accredited.\n\n336\n00:20:15.623 --> 00:20:19.443\n&gt;&gt; Right, that is close to\naccreditation as is feasibly possibly.\n\n337\n00:20:19.443 --> 00:20:20.754\n&gt;&gt; Sure, makes sense.\n\n338\n00:20:20.754 --> 00:20:25.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, which is why accreditation\nis actually really important, and\n\n339\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.938\nnowadays, especially, and\n\n340\n00:20:26.938 --> 00:20:32.190\nyou mentioned in a previous episode about\nyou're aware of government requirements.\n\n341\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.940\nThere are a lot of government\nrequirements nowadays that actually\n\n342\n00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.820\nspecifically require of their\nsuppliers certain standards or\n\n343\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.210\ncertain frameworks etc., to be in place,\nand if they don't have that,\n\n344\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.340\nand there's no documentary\nevidence of that, in other words,\n\n345\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:52.540\nthere's no visible certificate then they\nsimply will not employ that supplier.\n\n346\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.120\nSo how do you get your accreditation,\nand well let's take a look at this\n\n347\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.715\nparticular flow chart and we'll build\nthis up over the next couple of slides.\n\n348\n00:21:00.715 --> 00:21:05.010\nIn this particular flow chart we have, for\n\n349\n00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.740\nthe ISO 20000 certification,\n\n350\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.910\nwe have National Accreditation Bodies,\nand the National Accreditation Bodies\n\n351\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:18.569\nwill actually manage, in conjunction with\nthe International Standards Organization,\n\n352\n00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:24.825\nthey'll manage the certification\nscheme nationally within a country,\n\n353\n00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:29.835\nand they will actually register,\nthrough APM group and\n\n354\n00:21:29.835 --> 00:21:33.062\nthrough other examining boards,\nthey will register\n\n355\n00:21:34.062 --> 00:21:39.087\nauditors who will then come out and\nperform audits for you,\n\n356\n00:21:39.087 --> 00:21:43.452\nfor your organization, and will\nactually provide certification to you.\n\n357\n00:21:45.082 --> 00:21:49.798\nSo we have what we call the NABs,\nthe National Accreditation Bodies, and\n\n358\n00:21:49.798 --> 00:21:55.049\nthey're the people who actually oversee\nthe operation and the certification for\n\n359\n00:21:55.049 --> 00:21:59.766\npeople like auditors, for these people\nlike myself who actually train,\n\n360\n00:21:59.766 --> 00:22:04.280\nand who consult, and who actually\nperform audits on organizations.\n\n361\n00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.706\nBecause you see, in order to be\nan auditor, you have the power to either\n\n362\n00:22:09.706 --> 00:22:15.497\ngive a certificate away, or to reject,\nor to actually say, no I'm sorry,\n\n363\n00:22:15.497 --> 00:22:20.490\nbut you haven't achieved this\nparticular accreditations yet.\n\n364\n00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.080\nYou've not achieved the standards.\n\n365\n00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.456\n&gt;&gt; So with that particular\ncertification then Jo, or that title,\n\n366\n00:22:26.456 --> 00:22:30.507\nwould you also be able to offer\nany kind of consulting toward\n\n367\n00:22:30.507 --> 00:22:35.126\nan organization that may have not\nbeen successful for an audit, and\n\n368\n00:22:35.126 --> 00:22:39.932\nthen maybe give them suggestions,\nor is that a conflict of interest?\n\n369\n00:22:39.932 --> 00:22:43.688\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're getting into the realms of\nethics to be perfectly honest [LAUGH].\n\n370\n00:22:43.688 --> 00:22:46.097\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorry, okay, I'm just curious.\n\n371\n00:22:46.097 --> 00:22:52.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we will, best part,\nas were, as best as ever.\n\n372\n00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:57.310\nAn auditor will work with an organization\nto ensure that they've got the scope\n\n373\n00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:02.705\nwell defined, and\nI would expect any auditor to come\n\n374\n00:23:02.705 --> 00:23:06.525\ninto an organization, and to say to\nthat organization, do you know what,\n\n375\n00:23:06.525 --> 00:23:11.875\nyou have missed about 50% of\nyour managerial requirements.\n\n376\n00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:13.635\nYou're really not going to get past it so\n\n377\n00:23:13.635 --> 00:23:16.540\nlet's not bother doing\nthe audit right now.\n\n378\n00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.070\nGo away and\nwork out what it is that you want to do.\n\n379\n00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:23.217\nI don't expect any auditor\nto just simply come in, and\n\n380\n00:23:23.217 --> 00:23:29.186\nthen just do audit blindly, and then\njust say, yes you passed or no haven't.\n\n381\n00:23:29.186 --> 00:23:30.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I expect an auditor to,\n\n382\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:35.710\nat least work with an organization just to\nidentify exactly where they are in that\n\n383\n00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:40.763\naccreditation process, and even whether\nthey're ready for accreditation or not.\n\n384\n00:23:40.763 --> 00:23:45.726\nThen if there's evidence that they're\nready for accreditation, then yes,\n\n385\n00:23:45.726 --> 00:23:49.042\nan auditor would be able\nto audit them impartially.\n\n386\n00:23:49.042 --> 00:23:53.040\nNow, And this is where we get into that.\n\n387\n00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.773\nYou've asked me a really awful question,\nI'll be honest with you.\n\n388\n00:23:55.773 --> 00:23:56.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:23:56.786 --> 00:23:57.737\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm just thinking,\n\n390\n00:23:57.737 --> 00:24:00.340\nif I'm watching this show and\nit's really interesting information.\n\n391\n00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.700\nSo what if I wanted to take\nit to the next level and\n\n392\n00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.640\nactually go with that certification?\n\n393\n00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.146\nAnd maybe some other people-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n394\n00:24:06.146 --> 00:24:09.970\nI mean, what you can do is you\nfind consultants like myself.\n\n395\n00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:14.390\nYou'll find consultants in\nvarious places like in sort of,\n\n396\n00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:19.210\nI mean I don't know what to say, LinkedIn,\n\n397\n00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:23.890\nplaces like that, and consultants\nlike myself will come along and\n\n398\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:29.620\nwill advice, And we will coach\norganizations through an audit.\n\n399\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.720\nAnd what I'd always recommend,\nfor the sake of ethics to be\n\n400\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.120\nperfectly honest is find a consultant,\nfind somebody who, and\n\n401\n00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.680\nconsultants are generally auditors but\nthey're not your auditor.\n\n402\n00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n403\n00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.340\nThat makes sense.\n\n404\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.870\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, so\nfind a consultant to come out and\n\n405\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:50.080\nto advise your organization on\nthe best way to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n406\n00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.190\nBut make sure that that\nperson is not your auditor.\n\n407\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.690\nAnd then when the auditor comes in,\n\n408\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.960\nthe auditor will come in\nas an independent person.\n\n409\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:05.250\nAnd that auditor will be able to, and\nin most cases that auditor will liaise\n\n410\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:09.350\nwith the consultant and the consultant\nwill, and I use the word consultant cuz\n\n411\n00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.280\nthat's that they're doing at that\npoint in time, is they're consulting.\n\n412\n00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.580\nAnd the consultant will turn around and\nsay to the auditor,\n\n413\n00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:19.240\nin a lot of cases, we all know each other\n[LAUGH] and in a lot of cases I'll say,\n\n414\n00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.810\nhey look, these group of people are ready,\nthis organization is ready.\n\n415\n00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.260\nOr they might turn around and\nsay, no they're not.\n\n416\n00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:30.970\nAnd believe it or not,\nan auditor knows when you've had help.\n\n417\n00:25:32.058 --> 00:25:38.390\nAn auditor knows if somebody has prepared\nall of the responses on your behalf.\n\n418\n00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.490\nAnd that's not a bad thing,\nthat really, really isn't a bad\n\n419\n00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.810\nthing because it means that as an auditor\nyou can look at the responses and\n\n420\n00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.385\nyou know that they're okay, you know that\nthey're sort of good to go as it were.\n\n421\n00:25:48.385 --> 00:25:51.910\nAnd there's an assurance in that,\n\n422\n00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.720\nit doesn't mean that you're gonna be\naudited any less stringently, by the way.\n\n423\n00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.580\nIt doesn't mean that cuz\nyou've got a consultant,\n\n424\n00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.690\nthat's okay then the audit is given.\n\n425\n00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:00.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n426\n00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:05.070\nthat's not necessarily the case, I mean\nwell, it shouldn't be the case at all.\n\n427\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:12.800\nHowever I would also recommend that you\ndo that even if you were to get somebody\n\n428\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:18.260\nexternal as a consultant to come in and\ndo a preparatory audit for you.\n\n429\n00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.390\nWhich is just a preliminary audit to say,\nhey, look, do you know what?\n\n430\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.920\nThis is what I think the results of\nyour real audit are going to be.\n\n431\n00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.610\nAnd these are the areas that\nyou need to concentrate on,\n\n432\n00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:32.210\nthat would be a recommendation for\nanybody looking to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n433\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.464\nI mean, the worst case scenario\nthat would happen is in\n\n434\n00:26:35.464 --> 00:26:40.274\norder to with come in on your official\naudit and and say, no you haven't passed,\n\n435\n00:26:40.274 --> 00:26:44.771\nand here's your snagging list\nthe things you need to pick up on.\n\n436\n00:26:44.771 --> 00:26:47.143\nAnd then you have to take the audit again,\nbut\n\n437\n00:26:47.143 --> 00:26:49.522\nobviously there's a cost involved in that.\n\n438\n00:26:49.522 --> 00:26:50.056\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n439\n00:26:50.056 --> 00:26:53.707\nthere could also be credible\nissue involved in that as well.\n\n440\n00:26:53.707 --> 00:26:58.806\nIf you're trying to market yourself as\nan ISO 20000 accredited organization,\n\n441\n00:26:58.806 --> 00:27:03.545\nand then what if somebody reaches out to\nyou, and how many times did you apply for\n\n442\n00:27:03.545 --> 00:27:05.850\naudit before passed it?\n\n443\n00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.700\nIt's a bit like somebody asking you how\nmany times you sat your driving test\n\n444\n00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.226\nbefore you passed, right?\n\n445\n00:27:10.226 --> 00:27:10.934\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n446\n00:27:10.934 --> 00:27:13.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's kinda that sort of thing.\n\n447\n00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:18.050\nSome organizations wanna pass first\ntime and other organizations are happy\n\n448\n00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:22.580\nto work with an accrediting\nbody in order to get through.\n\n449\n00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:28.535\nAnd this is why on our next slide\nactually, we've got options and\n\n450\n00:27:28.535 --> 00:27:30.453\nI am glad you mentioned it.\n\n451\n00:27:30.453 --> 00:27:31.266\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n452\n00:27:31.266 --> 00:27:35.530\nthe ethics side of things gets me feeling\na little bit kinda hot under the collar.\n\n453\n00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:41.891\nBut nevertheless, we would advise\nthat if you are looking to attempt,\n\n454\n00:27:41.891 --> 00:27:47.088\nin all seriousness,\nan ISO 20000 accreditation for\n\n455\n00:27:47.088 --> 00:27:52.177\nyour organization,\nyou need at least one person that has\n\n456\n00:27:52.177 --> 00:27:57.390\nbeen trained up to the level\nof an ISO 20000 auditor.\n\n457\n00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.912\nNow whether that's an external\nconsultant that you brought in or\n\n458\n00:28:01.912 --> 00:28:05.612\nwhether that is somebody\nwithin your organization,\n\n459\n00:28:05.612 --> 00:28:10.812\nyou need at least one person who has\nbeen trained who can help you with this.\n\n460\n00:28:10.812 --> 00:28:17.370\nBecause they will decide, that person\nwill perform an internal audit and will\n\n461\n00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.650\ndecide whether you really stand a chance\nof actually passing your audit again.\n\n462\n00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.440\nWhen the auditor then comes in,\n\n463\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.780\nthat would be what we would consider\nto be the third party audit.\n\n464\n00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.607\nAnd they would give you\nan initial certification audit.\n\n465\n00:28:30.607 --> 00:28:34.850\nAnd then every year, for the next two\nyears after your initial certification,\n\n466\n00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:39.153\nyou then have what we call a surveillance\naudit, which is kind of a top off audit,\n\n467\n00:28:39.153 --> 00:28:43.801\njust to make sure that everything's okay,\nwhere we'll pick up on any snagging list.\n\n468\n00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:49.487\nNow, during those surveillance audits\nyour certification won't be removed.\n\n469\n00:28:49.487 --> 00:28:52.626\nBut after three years you\nwill be re-certified, and\n\n470\n00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:55.217\nthat will be a full\naudit every three years.\n\n471\n00:28:55.217 --> 00:28:59.745\nAnd if you don't pass that, there's no\nsnagging list that's released with that,\n\n472\n00:28:59.745 --> 00:29:02.730\nwe're taking the accreditation\naway from you.\n\n473\n00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.347\nYou lose that accreditation.\n\n474\n00:29:04.347 --> 00:29:08.620\nSo, we'd always recommend that you have\nsomebody internal that's going to-\n\n475\n00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.000\n&gt;&gt; And how long does that,\n\n476\n00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.044\nevery-\n&gt;&gt; Every year.\n\n477\n00:29:11.044 --> 00:29:12.155\n&gt;&gt; How long does that [CROSSTALK]?\n\n478\n00:29:12.155 --> 00:29:13.680\nSo every year until?\n\n479\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.695\n&gt;&gt; So what happens is you get your\ncertification audit, and then every year\n\n480\n00:29:17.695 --> 00:29:22.165\nfor two years, so if the next year you'll\nhave a surveillance audit, the following\n\n481\n00:29:22.165 --> 00:29:25.705\nyear you'll have a surveillance audit,\njust to make sure that everything's okay.\n\n482\n00:29:25.705 --> 00:29:30.175\nAnd if you slipped back in some\nthings then we'll say to you,\n\n483\n00:29:30.175 --> 00:29:32.015\nyou kind of slipped back.\n\n484\n00:29:32.015 --> 00:29:35.805\nAnd then, after the three years,\nyou'll get a full audit again.\n\n485\n00:29:35.805 --> 00:29:36.705\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And if you slipped\n\n486\n00:29:36.705 --> 00:29:38.440\nback in something then.\n\n487\n00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.270\nWell, you're gonna lose\nyour certification.\n\n488\n00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n489\n00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.550\n&gt;&gt; So, yes.\n\n490\n00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.510\nSo every three years,\nyou'll re-certified it.\n\n491\n00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.500\nBut every year,\nyou get a surveillance audit.\n\n492\n00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:54.303\nSo the surveillance audit,\nit's kind of just a heads up really.\n\n493\n00:29:54.303 --> 00:29:59.294\nBut of course, if you've got an internal\nauditor within the organization or\n\n494\n00:29:59.294 --> 00:30:04.284\nif you bring in an external consultant\nto do that internal phasing audit, and\n\n495\n00:30:04.284 --> 00:30:07.739\nthen you know way before\nyour actual official audit,\n\n496\n00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:12.000\nyou know where you are in terms\nof the actual audit itself, okay?\n\n497\n00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.920\nSo, what you could have in\nterms of an audit response is,\n\n498\n00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.740\nyou could have a nonconformity So\nnon-conformity is something\n\n499\n00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.300\nthat's recorded against a specific\nrequirement, as it says in part one.\n\n500\n00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.190\nAnd they're either major or minor.\n\n501\n00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.500\nA nonconformity,\n\n502\n00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:33.310\na major nonconformity is a failure to\nfulfill any one of the requirements.\n\n503\n00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.460\nOr any particular situation\nthat raises concern\n\n504\n00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:43.260\nabout the service provider's ability\nto fulfill that requirement.\n\n505\n00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.070\nSometimes when we come in and do an audit,\n\n506\n00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:50.510\nyou don't always know\nall of the situations.\n\n507\n00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:55.990\nYou don't always get to see a priority one\nincident, a major incident, really happen.\n\n508\n00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.530\nAnd short of actually going\nout into the organization and\n\n509\n00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:03.452\npressing that big red button, you're not\ngonna go and create a major incident.\n\n510\n00:31:03.452 --> 00:31:06.770\nBut nevertheless, I need to see\nevidence of a major incident process.\n\n511\n00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.850\nSo in which case then,\n\n512\n00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:15.390\nI wouldn't mark that down as a major\nnonconformity if I hadn't seen it,\n\n513\n00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:19.860\nbut I'd still expect to see evidence\nthat we've got a process in place.\n\n514\n00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.220\nAnd if I don't see that or\nsomething raises concerns to me that you\n\n515\n00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.278\nhaven't- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying not to laugh over here\n\n516\n00:31:27.278 --> 00:31:30.440\nbecause I'm thinking of,\nhave you ever seen Bad Santa?\n\n517\n00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.260\n&gt;&gt; No, I haven't, no.\n\n518\n00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.160\n&gt;&gt; So\njust imagine walking into a situation and\n\n519\n00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:40.475\njust how some ridiculous drunk IT\nmanager or something like that.\n\n520\n00:31:40.475 --> 00:31:43.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's a glaring nonconformity\n\n521\n00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:49.330\nincident, but I'm sure- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have actually had something very,\n\n522\n00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:53.290\nvery similar, where I had\nsomebody turn up to take a test\n\n523\n00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:58.025\nwho had rather a little\nbit too much to drink.\n\n524\n00:31:58.025 --> 00:32:02.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's crazy that we\neven are talking about this,\n\n525\n00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.862\nbut I'm sure it's gotta\nhappen at least sometimes.\n\n526\n00:32:06.862 --> 00:32:10.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I had somebody who has turned\nup in my class getting ready to take\n\n527\n00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.490\na test, who just have a little\nbit too much to drink.\n\n528\n00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthat will be a nonconformity issue.\n\n529\n00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat would definitely be a nonconformity.\n\n530\n00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.340\nYes, they didn't take the test that day.\n\n531\n00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:25.390\n[LAUGH] Nevertheless, but so yeah,\na major non conformity would be something\n\n532\n00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.990\nthat raises concern, and then you\nhave minor nonconformities as well.\n\n533\n00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:34.050\nIt's a nonconformity,\nit's not significant, but\n\n534\n00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.760\nit's definitely a noncompliance.\n\n535\n00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:42.170\nThen an observation,\nwell an observation is non-compulsory.\n\n536\n00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.960\nIt's a recommendation for\nimprovement, it's non-compulsory.\n\n537\n00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.750\nAnd something that we deem to be\noutside the scope of the audit,\n\n538\n00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.150\nwell that's something that\ndoesn't need to be audited.\n\n539\n00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.410\nBut any nonconformities Well,\nnonconformities are a failure.\n\n540\n00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.170\nWe need to ensure that\nthe nonconformities are worked on.\n\n541\n00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:04.130\nSo which is why I always tell you I'd\nalways recommend to have an internal audit\n\n542\n00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:09.320\nor maybe to get another auditor And\nother consultants come in,\n\n543\n00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.420\nand to actually work\nwith you before you get\n\n544\n00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.770\nthe actual auditor themselves coming\nin and doing the audit for you.\n\n545\n00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.530\nBecause you don't want to\nhave any nonconformities.\n\n546\n00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.790\nYou certainly don't want\na major nonconformity.\n\n547\n00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:27.400\nAnd even the minor nonconformities,\nyou wanna make sure they're gonna give you\n\n548\n00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.150\nopportunity to actually rectify that and\nto put something in place, but\n\n549\n00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.780\nyou've got to make sure that you're\nin the position to do that as well.\n\n550\n00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.640\nSo, at this point in time, what we've\nactually covered is, we've done a lot of,\n\n551\n00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.170\nwe've covered a lot of the sort\nof pre-requisites, as it were,\n\n552\n00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.920\nto the standard itself.\n\n553\n00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.340\nJust a general overview of the standard.\n\n554\n00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.300\nAnd on our next episode,\nwhat we're going to take a look\n\n555\n00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.590\nat is we're starting to\ntake a look at the clauses,\n\n556\n00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:58.450\nclauses four through to clauses\nnine in part one of ISO 20000.\n\n557\n00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:02.730\nSo we'll start off with clause four,\nwhich is our service management system.\n\n558\n00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:03.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan.\n\n559\n00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.300\nWe've got some SMS headed your way,\nso stay tuned for that.\n\n560\n00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.290\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n561\n00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.880\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n562\n00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.706\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n563\n00:34:11.706 --> 00:34:13.002\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n564\n00:34:13.002 -->

00:00:08.319\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.159\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:18.559\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to you ISO/IEC\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:21.010\nI'm you show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.730\nIn this episode we'll be looking\nat Clause 4 for our SMS, and\n\n8\n00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.420\nback in studios with us today we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.760\nHow's it going today Joe?\n\n10\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.600\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n11\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.405\nHow are you Cherokee?\n\n12\n00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:33.079\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, thank you for asking.\n\n13\n00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.409\nSo we've just exited our Part\n3 episode for our overview,\n\n14\n00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.460\nso what shall we be looking at first?\n\n15\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so in our previous episodes\nwe've looked at the standard itself and\n\n16\n00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.880\nwe've looked at the requirements\nof the actual standard too.\n\n17\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.590\nSo we've looked at Part 1\nwhich is the mandatory,\n\n18\n00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.580\nthe shalls, what you have to achieve.\n\n19\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.572\nAnd then we looked at Part 2,\n\n20\n00:00:56.572 --> 00:01:01.770\nwhich was the guidelines which you could\ndo this as well, this will help you.\n\n21\n00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.760\nAnd we've also looked at\nthe relationship between ISO 2000 and\n\n22\n00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.480\nother frameworks such as ITIL and\nCOBIT, etc.\n\n23\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.140\nSo now what we're gonna do is,\nwe're going to delve into then Part 1,\n\n24\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.560\nthese are the mandatory requirements.\n\n25\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.210\nAnd as we saw in a previous section,\nwe really are concentrating on,\n\n26\n00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.720\ncuz we've already looked at the scope.\n\n27\n00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.970\nAnd so we're concentrating now on\nthe service management system itself, so\n\n28\n00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.160\nhow we manage our services, and\nhow we manage our IT service provider.\n\n29\n00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.720\nAnd then, in subsequent sessions, we're\ngoing to look at Parts 5 through Part 9,\n\n30\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.660\nwhich are the processes that we're\ngoing to be auditing against.\n\n31\n00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.570\nSo at this particular minute in time,\nwe're looking at Part 4.\n\n32\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.973\nAnd Part 4 is our\nService Management System.\n\n33\n00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:51.778\nNow when we looked at our overview,\nwe started off by looking at the Plan,\n\n34\n00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:55.749\nDo, Check, Act or\nthe Deming Cycle as we otherwise know it.\n\n35\n00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.351\nAnd Plan, Do, Check,\n\n36\n00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:02.169\nAct is that iterative method that we\nuse to improve all of our services.\n\n37\n00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:06.527\nAnd to be perfectly honest, this is\nwhere exactly where we want to aim and\n\n38\n00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:08.394\nthis is what we want to aim for.\n\n39\n00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:13.610\nAnd this is where we need to be in order\nto achieve ISO 20000 accreditation.\n\n40\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.670\nWe need to be in a position where we have\n\n41\n00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.060\na continual improvement methodology\nsuch as Plan, Do, Check, Act.\n\n42\n00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.000\nAnd what I want to show you here is,\nat this particular diagram at the bottom\n\n43\n00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.350\nhere you've got your P, D, C, A,\nso you plan for an improvement.\n\n44\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.578\nYou do it,\nyou checked that it's worked and\n\n45\n00:02:36.578 --> 00:02:39.988\nthen you act on any\nimprovement initiatives.\n\n46\n00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:44.720\nNow we've already covered this in\na previous section where we looked\n\n47\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.963\na little bit more detail on\nplanning improvement, doing it,\n\n48\n00:02:48.963 --> 00:02:54.450\nchecking it's worked and then act is\nwhere we identify further improvements.\n\n49\n00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.790\nWhat are we going to do next?\n\n50\n00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.670\nNow what actually happens is that we have\na revolution of this, so this turns round.\n\n51\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.550\nBut as this goes round, as we're\nfollowing this particular process,\n\n52\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.590\nwe're moving up closer\ntowards business alignment.\n\n53\n00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.360\nThis particular access, or axis, here\nalong the bottom should actually be time.\n\n54\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.730\nAnd over time, we're becoming\ncloser to business alignment.\n\n55\n00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.640\nBut what we actually do is,\nand this is really important,\n\n56\n00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.470\nis that we will perform one revolution.\n\n57\n00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.270\nSo we plan something we'll do\nit we check that it worked, and\n\n58\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.950\nthen we will make recommendations for\nfuture improvement.\n\n59\n00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.720\nBut then we will put a chuck under\nthat wheel to stop it rolling back.\n\n60\n00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.408\nIn other words,\nthis is where we take a base line,\n\n61\n00:03:43.408 --> 00:03:46.368\nhere, this blue chuck here\nthat goes under the wheel.\n\n62\n00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:51.980\nAnd this stops us from rolling back we\ntake time to allow that improvement\n\n63\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.322\nto consolidate, to bed in stops\nthe improvement from rolling back.\n\n64\n00:03:57.322 --> 00:04:02.220\nIn other words it stops us from going\nback to our previous ways of working and\n\n65\n00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.497\nthen once we're certain that this is,\nit's been embedded in and\n\n66\n00:04:06.497 --> 00:04:09.792\nwe're fine with this,\nthen we'll start again.\n\n67\n00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:13.300\nAnd again we will perform a revolution.\n\n68\n00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.870\nAnd then again at this point in time,\nthen we put a chunk under that wheel and\n\n69\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.550\nwe allow that to bed in.\n\n70\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.904\nAnd then again, once that's bedded in and\nwe're comforting with our improvement,\n\n71\n00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:24.849\nthen we perform another revolution.\n\n72\n00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.950\nSo over time, bearing in mind that this\nbottom access along here is time over\n\n73\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.705\ntime, we are implementing, well as it\nsays here, effective quality improvement.\n\n74\n00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:38.766\nAnd we're coming closer\nto business alignment.\n\n75\n00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:45.155\nSo here we have here again this plan\nto check out this iterative cycle here.\n\n76\n00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:50.715\nAnd if we get it right, and\nthis is my if we get it right slide.\n\n77\n00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:54.132\nIf we get the service\nmanagement system right and\n\n78\n00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:59.210\nif we get improvement right, then what\nwe should be able to do is we should\n\n79\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.569\nbe in a position where we understand and\nwe fulfill all of our requirements.\n\n80\n00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.100\nIn other words,\nwe keep our customers happy.\n\n81\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.954\nWe have policies and\nwe have objectives for service management,\n\n82\n00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:15.935\nthat we can use then to\ndeliver value to our customer.\n\n83\n00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:20.499\nNow one thing that we haven't really\ntouched on here, and to be perfectly\n\n84\n00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:26.182\nhonest, in ISO 20000, because it's very,\nvery difficult for us to audit for this.\n\n85\n00:05:26.182 --> 00:05:30.292\nWe will audit for\nrelationship processes, but\n\n86\n00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:35.437\nwe have to be very aware of\nthe fact that value is perceived.\n\n87\n00:05:35.437 --> 00:05:39.657\nAnd so when we talk about\ndelivering value to our customers.\n\n88\n00:05:39.657 --> 00:05:44.152\nWell, we have to be able to demonstrate\nthat we deliver value to our customers.\n\n89\n00:05:44.152 --> 00:05:48.868\nWhich means that we've got to have\ngood relationship with our customers.\n\n90\n00:05:48.868 --> 00:05:51.493\nBecause we've gotta\ndemonstrate value to them so\n\n91\n00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:55.760\nwe have to understand what they\nvalue because value is perceived.\n\n92\n00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.360\nWe have to be able to monitor\nour service management system.\n\n93\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.890\nWe have to be able to monitor our\nservices themselves and our processes.\n\n94\n00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.290\nAnd we have to be able to demonstrate\nthat they are delivering value,\n\n95\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.250\nand that they're subject\nto continual improvement.\n\n96\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.970\nNot continuous, but continual, which\nis what we have in Plan-Do-Check-Act.\n\n97\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.057\nIt's a continual,\nit's a iterative method of improvement.\n\n98\n00:06:22.057 --> 00:06:24.461\nWhat we want to do is as we've said,\n\n99\n00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:28.481\nis to demonstrate good\nrelationships with our customers.\n\n100\n00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:33.316\nCuz we've got to demonstrate\nthat we can deliver value, so\n\n101\n00:06:33.316 --> 00:06:37.099\nwe have to have good\nrelationships with them.\n\n102\n00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.031\nNow we have a definition that\nwe use within ISO 20000, and\n\n103\n00:06:42.031 --> 00:06:45.661\nthat's the definition of top management,\nor\n\n104\n00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:49.774\nsenior management,\nas you might want to call them.\n\n105\n00:06:49.774 --> 00:06:52.975\nAnd our senior management,\nor top management,\n\n106\n00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:57.580\nare the people that are responsible for\nnot only defining the SMS, but\n\n107\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.719\nalso for maintaining and\ncontrolling the SMS.\n\n108\n00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:05.774\nOur SMS, our service management system,\nis a logical concept that\n\n109\n00:07:05.774 --> 00:07:10.830\nrefers to all of the policies and\nthe principles, the objectives,\n\n110\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.177\nand the processes that we put\ninto place in order manage and\n\n111\n00:07:15.177 --> 00:07:19.282\ndeliver value to our customer\nin the form of services.\n\n112\n00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:22.517\nSo we have to take\nan end-to-end service approach.\n\n113\n00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:26.975\nWe have to consider the entire service\nthis is not just about delivering\n\n114\n00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:28.099\nthe technology.\n\n115\n00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:32.962\nThis is also about delivery service\nfrom an end-to-end perspective including\n\n116\n00:07:32.962 --> 00:07:36.824\ndelivering customer service,\nincluding delivering incident\n\n117\n00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:41.197\nmanagement including picking up\nthe pieces when something goes wrong.\n\n118\n00:07:41.197 --> 00:07:46.144\nWe have to have escalation policy in place\nfor making changes to the services and for\n\n119\n00:07:46.144 --> 00:07:48.275\nwhen something goes wrong as well.\n\n120\n00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:51.225\nAnd we also have to demonstrate,\nand I'm gonna\n\n121\n00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:56.166\nuse that word a lot when it talks about\nISO 20000 because, you've got to,\n\n122\n00:07:56.166 --> 00:08:01.440\nif you want to achieve ISO 20000\naccreditation, you've got to demonstrate.\n\n123\n00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.449\nYou've got to be able to articulate\nThat you are actually performing all\n\n124\n00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:13.004\nof the mandatory requirements\nwithin part one of ISO 20000.\n\n125\n00:08:13.004 --> 00:08:15.930\nYou have to articulate this.\n\n126\n00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.217\nYou have to demonstrate.\n\n127\n00:08:17.217 --> 00:08:19.896\nI like to use words like, show me.\n\n128\n00:08:19.896 --> 00:08:23.670\nAnd that also means that in order\nto be able to deliver value,\n\n129\n00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.230\nyou've gotta have\nthe right people involved.\n\n130\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.889\nI talked about having capabilities\nin a previous episode.\n\n131\n00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:35.152\nAnd again, we've gotta demonstrate,\ndemonstrate again, showing me that we have\n\n132\n00:08:35.152 --> 00:08:40.645\nthe right people with the right skills to\nbe able to deliver value to our customers.\n\n133\n00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:45.285\nSo we have to show we've got the right\npeople, if that means recognizing and\n\n134\n00:08:45.285 --> 00:08:47.045\nrewarding the right people as well.\n\n135\n00:08:48.525 --> 00:08:50.645\nSo your SMS, it's another tool.\n\n136\n00:08:51.673 --> 00:08:56.435\nThere are toolsets that can help you with\nthis, but your SMS is not a tool in and\n\n137\n00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.620\nof itself.\n\n138\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.655\nAnd it consists of a policy,\npolicy for managing services.\n\n139\n00:09:01.655 --> 00:09:04.000\nIt consist of an organizational chart,\n\n140\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.110\nthese are the people with\na defined responsibility.\n\n141\n00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:12.060\nAnd it consists of processes,\nprocesses that themselves have policies.\n\n142\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.130\nProcesses that require planning,\nprocesses that actually perform planning.\n\n143\n00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.170\nProcesses that perform implementation,\n\n144\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.890\nand process that perform\nthe operation of our services.\n\n145\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.280\nProcesses that assess our services to\nmake sure that they're still aligned to\n\n146\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.180\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n147\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:34.310\nAnd processes that highlight\nimplementation of improvements for\n\n148\n00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.210\nall of our services as well.\n\n149\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.920\nSo our SMS, our service management system,\nis not just about a tool.\n\n150\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.960\nAnd it's not even just\nabout the documentation.\n\n151\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.220\nIt's also about the people as well.\n\n152\n00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.316\nEverything that we need to\nmanage our IT services.\n\n153\n00:09:53.316 --> 00:09:59.849\nThe service management system is\na structured framework, as it says there.\n\n154\n00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:05.590\nAnd this is where you can have\nthat confusion with ITIL.\n\n155\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.870\nITIL is a framework for\ncert managing services, a framework for\n\n156\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.020\nservice management.\n\n157\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.440\nIt's a best practice framework for\nservice management and\n\n158\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.900\nit is not a one size fits all approach,\nokay?\n\n159\n00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.187\nIt's not,\nit's something that you have to adapt.\n\n160\n00:10:22.187 --> 00:10:24.200\nISO 20000 is a standard.\n\n161\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.060\nIt's something that you have to achieve.\n\n162\n00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.080\nYou implement ITIL, but\nyou achieve ISO 20000, okay?\n\n163\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.643\nIt's a check in the box.\n\n164\n00:10:35.643 --> 00:10:40.572\nIt's a certificate on the wall\nto say that yes, I've got and\n\n165\n00:10:40.572 --> 00:10:46.190\nan efficient and effective service\nmanagement framework in place.\n\n166\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.850\nAnd this SMS is what we use\nto govern that framework.\n\n167\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.790\nThe SMS ensures that we\nhave a framework in place.\n\n168\n00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.060\nAnd it also ensures that we are subject to\n\n169\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.840\ncontinual improvement\nwithin that framework.\n\n170\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.900\nSo it means having defined roles,\nas we've already said,\n\n171\n00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.410\nand defined responsibilities.\n\n172\n00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:13.090\nWith everybody having the relevant\ncapability to be able to do their role.\n\n173\n00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:17.880\nAnd if we have an SMS in place,\nand if we are working towards and\n\n174\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.668\nhave achieved ISO 20000,\nthen the customers have got\n\n175\n00:11:21.668 --> 00:11:26.190\nan assurance of quality service provision.\n\n176\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:32.610\nIn other words, they are assured\nthat we are working in a consistent,\n\n177\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:39.830\nand in an efficient and effective manner,\nto enable us to deliver value to them.\n\n178\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.490\nSo we've got some definitions\nhere on this next slide.\n\n179\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.720\nAnd our definitions are just things\nthat we've already talked about,\n\n180\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.430\ntop management.\n\n181\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.650\nThese are the people that\ncontrol the service provider.\n\n182\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.174\nSo these are our senior management.\n\n183\n00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:56.710\nContinual improvement,\nas opposed to continuous.\n\n184\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.360\nContinual means iterative improvement.\n\n185\n00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.080\nThen we have corrective action,\nthat's something that we undertake.\n\n186\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.851\nAnd these terms, you will find these\nin your downloadable material as well\n\n187\n00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:12.890\nthat accompanies these\nparticular episodes.\n\n188\n00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.183\nCorrective action,\n\n189\n00:12:14.183 --> 00:12:18.577\nthat's something that we do in order\nto put something right basically.\n\n190\n00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:22.103\nAnd as it says,\neither we'll eliminate the cause or\n\n191\n00:12:22.103 --> 00:12:27.320\nreduce the likelihood of a nonconformity\nwithin in our audit process.\n\n192\n00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.840\nAnd preventive action,\n\n193\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.930\nwell, that's action that we take to try\nand prevent something from happening.\n\n194\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.770\nCorrective action is something\nthat we take to pick up the pieces\n\n195\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.300\nafter something's happened.\n\n196\n00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.260\nAnd preventive action, well,\npreventive action is something that we\n\n197\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.080\ndo to prevent a non-conformity\nfrom happening.\n\n198\n00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.910\nAnd of course, a risk, well, we know that\na risk is just the effective uncertainty.\n\n199\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.510\nA risk is something that could happen.\n\n200\n00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:59.580\nAnd of course, when it comes to ISO 20000,\nwe have to identify any\n\n201\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.430\nrisks to us actually achieving ISO 20000.\n\n202\n00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.680\nAnd then we have the service requirement,\nanother definition here.\n\n203\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.630\nAnd the service requirement is just\na generic definition for the needs\n\n204\n00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.650\nof the customer and the users, including\nthe service level requirements as it said.\n\n205\n00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.740\nAnd the needs of the business and\nany other users of the service as well.\n\n206\n00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.530\nSo the service requirement\nis something that is\n\n207\n00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.180\nneeded to be able to deliver the service.\n\n208\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.350\nWe've also gotta document,\nwe know what a document is, okay?\n\n209\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.270\nWell, it's information,\nit's something that we can print off.\n\n210\n00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.160\nDocumentation can be\nin any form of medium.\n\n211\n00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.530\nNowadays, we see things in PDFs,\nfor instance, quite a lot.\n\n212\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.425\nOr you might see things as PowerPoints.\n\n213\n00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.020\nJust remember that documents, we've got\nto articulate the documentation exists.\n\n214\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.710\nAnd documentation has to be\nsubject to version control.\n\n215\n00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.550\nIt has to be subject to version control.\n\n216\n00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.760\nYou don't just overwrite a document,\nthink version control.\n\n217\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:04.880\nWe've got a process, which is a set of\ninterrelated or interactive activities,\n\n218\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.320\nwhich takes an input and\ntransforms it into an output.\n\n219\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.480\nAnd then a procedure is actually\na specific way to carry our\n\n220\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.410\na specific activity within a process.\n\n221\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.775\nSo a process is a set of activities and\n\n222\n00:14:17.775 --> 00:14:22.110\ntheir procedure is how we carry\nout individual activities.\n\n223\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.820\nAnd then a record is that\ndocumentary evidence.\n\n224\n00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.271\nSo for instance,\na change record is the documentary\n\n225\n00:14:29.271 --> 00:14:32.618\nevidence of every request for change.\n\n226\n00:14:32.618 --> 00:14:33.770\nNow I really like this diagram.\n\n227\n00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.714\nAnd for those of you that are observant,\nyou will notice, especially if you've\n\n228\n00:14:38.714 --> 00:14:42.641\ndone the ITIL foundation,\nthat this diagram is actually very,\n\n229\n00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:46.780\nvery similar to a diagram that\nwe used in ITIL foundation.\n\n230\n00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.960\nAnd this is a diagram where\nwe describe our processes.\n\n231\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.310\nAnd so what I really want you to do\nis I just wanna take you through\n\n232\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.305\na process itself and\nhow we actually build up the process.\n\n233\n00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:05.230\nNow, by the way, here we are, we're in ISO\n20000 and we are auditing your processes.\n\n234\n00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.740\nWe're not defining your processes for you.\n\n235\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.922\nIf you want to learn how\nto define a process,\n\n236\n00:15:10.922 --> 00:15:16.352\nthen we're going to look at that in\nITIL and take a look at ITIL foundation.\n\n237\n00:15:16.352 --> 00:15:22.131\nAnd in the ITIL classes, they will be\nable to help you with defining processes.\n\n238\n00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:28.040\nHere in ISO 20000, we're auditing the\nprocesses that you already have in place.\n\n239\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.960\nSo this particular diagram is very,\nvery useful for ITIL and\n\n240\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.610\nfor defining processes.\n\n241\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.490\nAnd it's very, very useful for you when\nyou're looking to order the process.\n\n242\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:43.980\nBut I want you just to bear with me for a\nmoment and let's just build up a process.\n\n243\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.010\nLet's work out how we\nactually do define a process.\n\n244\n00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:52.850\nAnd how they do that in ITIL and also how\nyou would do this in your organization.\n\n245\n00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.139\nWe start off with a process objective.\n\n246\n00:15:56.139 --> 00:16:00.173\nAnd a process objective would be\nsomething along the lines of, let's say,\n\n247\n00:16:00.173 --> 00:16:01.441\nincident management.\n\n248\n00:16:01.441 --> 00:16:05.246\nAnd the objective is to restore\nservice operation, which,\n\n249\n00:16:05.246 --> 00:16:07.866\nin other words, means to fix something.\n\n250\n00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:11.877\nSo if we know that the objective is\nto fix something, then therefore that\n\n251\n00:16:11.877 --> 00:16:16.569\nfollows that the output from incident\nmanagement is something that's been fixed.\n\n252\n00:16:16.569 --> 00:16:17.256\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n253\n00:16:17.256 --> 00:16:18.091\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah.\n\n254\n00:16:18.091 --> 00:16:18.958\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n255\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.500\nif the output is something that's\nbeen fixed, then the input must be?\n\n256\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.160\n&gt;&gt; Something broken.\n\n257\n00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.675\n&gt;&gt; Something broken, right.\n\n258\n00:16:24.675 --> 00:16:29.402\nAnd the activities are everything\nthat's needed to get from something\n\n259\n00:16:29.402 --> 00:16:31.302\nbroken to something fixed.\n\n260\n00:16:31.302 --> 00:16:33.470\nNow, every process has\ngot to have an owner.\n\n261\n00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.770\nAnd we've gotta be able to measure\nwhether a process is working.\n\n262\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:43.570\nAnd all processes, well, somebody has to\ndo them, and so our resources and their\n\n263\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:48.680\ncapabilities then tangible assets our\nresources, our hardware, and our people.\n\n264\n00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.818\nAnd the capabilities that they have well,\nthey're needed in order to\n\n265\n00:16:53.818 --> 00:16:59.411\nperform those activities to get from\nsomething broken to something fixed.\n\n266\n00:16:59.411 --> 00:17:02.818\nThat's just a very high level example,\nbut here I am so\n\n267\n00:17:02.818 --> 00:17:06.090\nif I'm in ISO 20000,\nthen what am I auditing?\n\n268\n00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:13.040\nWell, what I'm making sure in ISO 20000\nis that your process has an objective.\n\n269\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.835\nI'm making sure that your process has an\nowner and that you measure your process.\n\n270\n00:17:18.835 --> 00:17:24.473\nI'm making sure that you understand what\noutput you expect from your promises and\n\n271\n00:17:24.473 --> 00:17:29.970\nthat you have an understanding of what\ninput you could expect into you process.\n\n272\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:34.190\nAnd that you have defined activities for\nall of your processes and\n\n273\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.740\nthat you understand what skills you need,\nand also how many people you need\n\n274\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.240\nto be able to perform your process\nefficiently and effectively.\n\n275\n00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.580\nSo once we use this diagram in\nITIL in order to define a process,\n\n276\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.664\nwe also use this diagram or\n\n277\n00:17:50.664 --> 00:17:56.561\nsomething similar in ISO 20000 to\nbe able to audit a process as well.\n\n278\n00:17:56.561 --> 00:18:01.054\nSo looking at our service management\nsystem then we have actually a pictorial\n\n279\n00:18:01.054 --> 00:18:05.840\nrepresentation of the service management\nsystem, and I really quite like this.\n\n280\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.210\nBecause what's in the grey here,\nwell, what's in that grey is all\n\n281\n00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:18.230\nof the governance that is needed to\nmanage our IT services, including\n\n282\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:23.120\nthe management responsibility and\nresource management managing the people.\n\n283\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.975\nAny governance of any processes that\nare operated by our third parties as well,\n\n284\n00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:30.014\nand their documentation, too.\n\n285\n00:18:30.014 --> 00:18:35.228\nAnd then we have our design and\ntransition of our new services.\n\n286\n00:18:35.228 --> 00:18:40.099\nAnd these include our delivery processes,\nsuch as capacity management and\n\n287\n00:18:40.099 --> 00:18:43.983\ncontinuity and availability,\nservice level management,\n\n288\n00:18:43.983 --> 00:18:49.715\nservice reporting, security management,\nbudgeting and accounting as well.\n\n289\n00:18:49.715 --> 00:18:53.507\nThen we have controlled processes,\nsuch as configuration and\n\n290\n00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:55.663\nchange in release and deployment.\n\n291\n00:18:55.663 --> 00:18:58.675\nAnd then we have resolution\nprocesses such as incident and\n\n292\n00:18:58.675 --> 00:19:01.737\nservice request management and\nproblem management.\n\n293\n00:19:01.737 --> 00:19:07.691\nAnd also relationship processes too such\nas business relationship management and\n\n294\n00:19:07.691 --> 00:19:09.398\nsupplier management.\n\n295\n00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:14.957\nSo this is our pictorial representation\nof our service management system.\n\n296\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.930\nSo, what do we have to do then?\n\n297\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.980\nWhat about these shalls for\nour service management system?\n\n298\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.214\nWell, top management,\n\n299\n00:19:23.214 --> 00:19:27.284\nthat's our senior management then we've\nalready talked about top management.\n\n300\n00:19:27.284 --> 00:19:32.133\nTop management has to provide evidence\nof the commitment to the SMS,\n\n301\n00:19:32.133 --> 00:19:36.563\nour top manager has to provide\nevidence that there is a scope and\n\n302\n00:19:36.563 --> 00:19:41.257\nwe have policies that we call\nobjectives for service management.\n\n303\n00:19:41.257 --> 00:19:45.964\nWe've got to also provide evidence\nof the fact that we communicate how\n\n304\n00:19:45.964 --> 00:19:50.513\nwe fulfill our service requirements,\nin other words reporting and\n\n305\n00:19:50.513 --> 00:19:52.930\nregulatory requirements as well.\n\n306\n00:19:53.988 --> 00:19:57.740\nSo we've gotta provide evidence of a plan,\nwe've gotta provide evidence of\n\n307\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.982\nan organization chart and of things\nlike skills matrices for instance.\n\n308\n00:20:02.982 --> 00:20:06.860\nWe've gotta provide evidence of risk\nmanagement, we've gotta provide evidence\n\n309\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:12.890\nthat management reviews are conducted\nas well for all of our services.\n\n310\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:20.510\nWe've gotta make sure that the service\nmanagement policy is relevant, right.\n\n311\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:25.040\nThat the policy for managing ourselves\nis relevant to our organization, and\n\n312\n00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.540\nthat it's communicated to everybody and\nagain I want to see evidence of this.\n\n313\n00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:35.286\nAnd that policy Needs to include how we\nfulfill all of our service requirements,\n\n314\n00:20:35.286 --> 00:20:37.914\nand what framework we have in place.\n\n315\n00:20:37.914 --> 00:20:42.456\nIn other words, what processes we have\nin place and the documentation for\n\n316\n00:20:42.456 --> 00:20:43.638\nthose processes.\n\n317\n00:20:43.638 --> 00:20:49.539\nAnd also, that those processes\nare subject to continual improvement.\n\n318\n00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:54.013\nManagement also ensures that\nwe've got the right people in\n\n319\n00:20:54.013 --> 00:20:57.412\nplace with the right level of authority,\nand\n\n320\n00:20:57.412 --> 00:21:03.158\nthat any communication that is undertaken\nis documented and articulated.\n\n321\n00:21:03.158 --> 00:21:08.180\nSo we have to have a management\nrepresentative as we say in ISO 20000,\n\n322\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.492\nor a manager who is responsible for\n\n323\n00:21:10.492 --> 00:21:14.420\nensuring that all service\nrequirements are identified.\n\n324\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:21.460\nThat all of the processes are designed and\nimplemented and they're improved as well.\n\n325\n00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.340\nThat they're integrated into this SMS, and\n\n326\n00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:31.310\nthat they support the policy and\nobjectives for service management.\n\n327\n00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.570\nWe have to ensure that somebody\ntakes responsibility for\n\n328\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.300\nmanaging our assets\nincluding licenses as well.\n\n329\n00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:43.131\nAnd we also have to ensure\nthat we have a representative\n\n330\n00:21:43.131 --> 00:21:48.455\nwho reports to our senior\nmanagement on the SMS and\n\n331\n00:21:48.455 --> 00:21:52.539\nits performance and on our services.\n\n332\n00:21:52.539 --> 00:21:56.927\nSo what this means is that we have\nto have a set of defined roles and\n\n333\n00:21:56.927 --> 00:22:01.400\nresponsibilities for who is going\nto not only manage our SMS, but\n\n334\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.768\nwho's going to define policies and\nwho's going to maintain those policies,\n\n335\n00:22:06.768 --> 00:22:11.760\nand who's actually going to be\nresponsible for communication as well.\n\n336\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:19.030\nSo we might use something like\na RACI matrix in order to be able to\n\n337\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.550\ndefine those responsibilities and actually\nallocate those roles and responsibilities.\n\n338\n00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.850\nNow RACI matrix is something\nthat I'm sure everybody's\n\n339\n00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.540\nused in their day to day world.\n\n340\n00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.922\nThis is something that you're\nfamiliar with, isn't it Cherokee?\n\n341\n00:22:31.922 --> 00:22:33.908\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's tie in Six Sigma as well.\n\n342\n00:22:33.908 --> 00:22:40.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes yeah, RACI Matrix is stand\npractice within IT, it's just\n\n343\n00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.750\nsomething that we use to, as we've already\nsaid to define roles and responsibilities.\n\n344\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.550\nSo it's something that\neverybody should familiar with.\n\n345\n00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.552\nNow as we've already said,\nas I've already said,\n\n346\n00:22:50.552 --> 00:22:55.396\nI'm not gonna provide you with guidance on\nhow to do these things, what I'm going to\n\n347\n00:22:55.396 --> 00:23:00.062\ntell you here in ISO 20,000 is exactly\nwhat you're going to be audited on.\n\n348\n00:23:00.062 --> 00:23:05.335\nThat's what we're looking at is we're\nlooking at the actual audit itself,\n\n349\n00:23:05.335 --> 00:23:09.405\nwe're looking at what you\nare going to be audited against.\n\n350\n00:23:09.405 --> 00:23:13.189\nI'm not in this particular\nseries of episodes in\n\n351\n00:23:13.189 --> 00:23:17.724\nthis show I'm not going to tell\nyou how to do these things.\n\n352\n00:23:17.724 --> 00:23:21.288\nIf you want to know more\nabout how to do these things,\n\n353\n00:23:21.288 --> 00:23:25.986\nthen you could get some help within\nsort of Lean Sigma or Six Sigma, or\n\n354\n00:23:25.986 --> 00:23:28.914\nmaybe take a look at\nthe ITIL shows as well.\n\n355\n00:23:28.914 --> 00:23:34.938\nThey will be able to help you in achieving\nthese in actually implementing these.\n\n356\n00:23:34.938 --> 00:23:38.480\nWhat I'm going to do is just\ntell you what we're auditing.\n\n357\n00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.302\nSo an example of roles and\nresponsibilities, and\n\n358\n00:23:42.302 --> 00:23:44.034\nthese come from ITIL.\n\n359\n00:23:44.034 --> 00:23:48.903\nSo these are examples that are pulled\nfrom ITIL, and these are just examples.\n\n360\n00:23:48.903 --> 00:23:52.547\nAnd I expect to see When\nyou're being audited,\n\n361\n00:23:52.547 --> 00:23:56.656\nI expect to see a list of roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n362\n00:23:56.656 --> 00:24:00.631\nI expect to see something similar to this,\nthat outlines your service owner and\n\n363\n00:24:00.631 --> 00:24:03.375\nwhat the service owner will\ntake responsibility for.\n\n364\n00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:07.254\nA process owner and\nwhat the process owner will\n\n365\n00:24:07.254 --> 00:24:11.342\ntake responsibility for,\nI expect to see this.\n\n366\n00:24:11.342 --> 00:24:14.850\nI expect you to have the evidence of this.\n\n367\n00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.380\nI do not expect to be working\nwith you as an auditor.\n\n368\n00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.040\nI do not expect to be working\nwith you to define these.\n\n369\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.150\nI expect you to have this evidence.\n\n370\n00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.910\nSo what else do we have\nto do then in our Part 1?\n\n371\n00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:37.000\nWell, in our Part 1, we look at\nthe governance of processes as well.\n\n372\n00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.410\nSo these are for clauses 5 through to\nclauses 9, which are all about processes.\n\n373\n00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.930\nThe processes that we saw\nwithin that SMS diagram.\n\n374\n00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:46.660\nAnd by the way,\n\n375\n00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.590\ndon't think that that's the last\ntime we're gonna see this diagram.\n\n376\n00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.203\nWe are gonna see this diagram\nquite a lot all right?\n\n377\n00:24:53.203 --> 00:24:55.230\nSo don't worry about that.\n\n378\n00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.654\nBut even though it's processes that\nare managed by external providers,\n\n379\n00:24:59.654 --> 00:25:04.006\nwe still have to provide evidence that\nthose processes are meeting all of\n\n380\n00:25:04.006 --> 00:25:06.590\nthe requirements that are within Part 1.\n\n381\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:11.520\nSo if I look this particular diagram here,\nand this particular diagram\n\n382\n00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:17.010\nshows that sometimes the service\nprovider is dependent on other parties.\n\n383\n00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.454\nIncluding suppliers,\nincluding internal groups, including maybe\n\n384\n00:25:21.454 --> 00:25:26.650\neven customers that are acting as\npartners there, even in that instance.\n\n385\n00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:34.310\nWhilst the ISO 20000 ordered is applicable\njust to us, just to the service provider.\n\n386\n00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.100\nNevertheless, we will\naudit all of these inputs\n\n387\n00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.340\nfrom all of these external parties,\nexternal to the service provider.\n\n388\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:50.330\nBecause they will determine whether\nyou're able to achieve ISO 20000 or not.\n\n389\n00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:55.690\nSo in our service management system,\nwe have to maintain the documents and\n\n390\n00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.900\nrecords, including, and like I said,\n\n391\n00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.825\nI am always going to say show me,\nincluding the policies and the objectives.\n\n392\n00:26:03.825 --> 00:26:06.600\nA plan for service management,\n\n393\n00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.900\nincluding a catalog of our services,\nincluding service level agreements.\n\n394\n00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.570\nThe agreements between IT and\nour customers,\n\n395\n00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:19.200\nand including any contracts that\nwe may have, and any internal or\n\n396\n00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.930\nexternal documents such as OLAs and\noperational level agreements.\n\n397\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.800\nAnd that documentation\nhas to be controlled.\n\n398\n00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.220\nSo we have to have a document\nmanagement policy, and\n\n399\n00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:36.720\na document management process,\nthat will control the documentation.\n\n400\n00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:42.410\nThat will do basic documentation control,\nsuch as ensuring we've got versions,\n\n401\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:46.750\nensuring that nothing's overwritten,\nensuring that nothing's deleted, etc.\n\n402\n00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:51.110\nAnd the same goes for our records as well,\nour records have to be controlled.\n\n403\n00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.362\nNow, all of these Part 1 shells,\nas they're mentioned here,\n\n404\n00:26:57.362 --> 00:27:01.810\nwell, I'm gonna say show me, and\nthat's what I'm gonna say to you.\n\n405\n00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.570\nAnd I'm gonna carry on saying\nthis throughout all of our\n\n406\n00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.490\nsubsequent episodes as well.\n\n407\n00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.090\nDon't just tell me, you have to show me.\n\n408\n00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.340\nI'm telling you this is\nwhat you've got to show me.\n\n409\n00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:17.850\nI want to see this, every single\nsentence that's in all of these slides.\n\n410\n00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.940\nI want to say to you, show me.\n\n411\n00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.160\nShow me how you're\ncontrolling your records.\n\n412\n00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.270\nWhen I mean records,\nI mean individual incident records, or\n\n413\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.360\nchange records, or problem records.\n\n414\n00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.040\nShow me how they're controlled.\n\n415\n00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.890\nShow me that an incident can't be deleted.\n\n416\n00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.220\nShow me that a problem cannot be deleted.\n\n417\n00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.670\nShow me that a change cannot\nbe closed without going\n\n418\n00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:44.310\nthrough the appropriate process.\n\n419\n00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.882\nThat's what I'm asking for.\n\n420\n00:27:47.882 --> 00:27:50.077\nI'm asking for this with documentation.\n\n421\n00:27:50.077 --> 00:27:53.486\nI'm asking for\nthis with all of your records as well.\n\n422\n00:27:53.486 --> 00:27:55.480\nAnd that's what I'm asking for.\n\n423\n00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.890\nNow, we also need to\nensure that we provide\n\n424\n00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:08.360\nthe resources to manage all of these\ncomponents in our Part 1, in our Shall.\n\n425\n00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.960\nAnd that means all of\nthe technical resources.\n\n426\n00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.990\nIt means our relation-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n427\n00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.550\nwhat are you doing to\nsave these documents?\n\n428\n00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:16.780\nAre you using SharePoint, are you using\na cloud provider, so all of that.\n\n429\n00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n430\n00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:22.350\nYeah, and in fact, now we've even got,\nvery, very recently, in fact,\n\n431\n00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.820\nin just about 18 months ago now.\n\n432\n00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.460\nThere was a new part\nreleased to ISO 20000,\n\n433\n00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.820\nwhich actually specifically\ncovered cloud computing.\n\n434\n00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; And how this applies to using\n\n435\n00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.980\ncloud as an external provider.\n\n436\n00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.515\nBecause a lot of organizations\nnowadays are using cloud.\n\n437\n00:28:41.515 --> 00:28:44.400\nWe don't always have,\nunfortunately we don't always have\n\n438\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.710\nsort of the relevant skills in house.\n\n439\n00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.970\nAnd we don't need to anymore,\nbecause it's an expensive thing to do.\n\n440\n00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.350\nSo when we talk about our resources,\n\n441\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:02.650\nwe talk about our external resources,\nthose that are externally managed as well.\n\n442\n00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:08.380\nSo we have to demonstrate that the people\nthat we have as well are competent.\n\n443\n00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.620\nThat they've got the appropriate skills,\nand that they have got the appropriate\n\n444\n00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.490\ntraining, and that they've got\nthe experience, etc., as well.\n\n445\n00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:21.040\nAnd so we have to make sure that we,\nagain, I'm saying, show me.\n\n446\n00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.860\nIn part 1, I'm always saying, show me.\n\n447\n00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.850\nThis is [LAUGH] what I\nsay a lot to people.\n\n448\n00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:31.390\nSo when it comes to people,\nI will say, show me.\n\n449\n00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:32.860\nShow me exactly what you've got.\n\n450\n00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.910\nShow me that you've got skill matrices.\n\n451\n00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.170\nShow me that you're doing regular\nperformance reviews with these people.\n\n452\n00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:41.630\nShow me that you have evidence and\njob descriptions, etc.\n\n453\n00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:46.160\nAnd that the people\nare actually able to fulfill\n\n454\n00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.750\nall of the service requirements\nthat you have on your service.\n\n455\n00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.870\nUltimately, we've got to make sure that\nwe work with the customer to continually\n\n456\n00:29:57.145 --> 00:30:02.945\nimprove our services to continually\nprovide services that our customers need.\n\n457\n00:30:02.945 --> 00:30:10.765\nSo if I look here at the responsibility\nhere of establishing the SMS,\n\n458\n00:30:10.765 --> 00:30:15.875\nwe've got to ensure that we improve\nthe SMS on a regular basis as well.\n\n459\n00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.060\nSo at this point in time,\n\n460\n00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.770\nwhat I'm actually going to say is that\nwe have reached the end of Part 1.\n\n461\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Of looking at the SMS,\n\n462\n00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.520\nbecause I know that we've\nhad a lot of information.\n\n463\n00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:33.010\nBut don't forget, when we look at the SMS\nwhat we're looking at it, what we're\n\n464\n00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:38.640\ngoing to be auditing for, what we're going\nto be checking that you have in place,\n\n465\n00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.810\nI don't expect to see one tool\nwith all of this information.\n\n466\n00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:49.780\nWhat I expect to see is that you have\na hierarchy of management in place.\n\n467\n00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.670\nThat when I say to you, show me,\nyou can say, okay, yes.\n\n468\n00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.240\nIt's in this tool here.\n\n469\n00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.380\nThis is how I access it, and this is\nthe evidence that you're asking for.\n\n470\n00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.580\nThat's what I expect to see.\n\n471\n00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.780\nI don't expect you to have\nsomething called an SMS.\n\n472\n00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:13.818\nI expect you to have the tools at your\nfinger tips to be able to show me.\n\n473\n00:31:13.818 --> 00:31:15.625\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n474\n00:31:15.625 --> 00:31:19.620\nSo if we ever get in that situation,\nthen we should know what to expect then.\n\n475\n00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:20.685\nJo wants to see that.\n\n476\n00:31:20.685 --> 00:31:23.085\nThe auditors,\nthey want to see that, right?\n\n477\n00:31:23.085 --> 00:31:24.875\nSo thank you for\nproviding that information, but\n\n478\n00:31:24.875 --> 00:31:26.845\nI know you said we have\nmore to cover here.\n\n479\n00:31:26.845 --> 00:31:31.255\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned for\nthat, but for this show we will sign out.\n\n480\n00:31:31.255 --> 00:31:32.775\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n481\n00:31:32.775 --> 00:31:33.675\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n482\n00:31:33.675 --> 00:31:35.600\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV\n\n483\n00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:42.126\n[MUSIC]\n\n484\n00:31:42.126 --> 00:31:45.129\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.420\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.841\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:18.579\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your ISO/IEC\n20000: 2011 Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.700\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.430\nIn this episode,\nwe'll pick right back up with a part two,\n\n8\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.430\nwhere we're really looking\nat Clause 4 with our SMS.\n\n9\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.497\nAnd back with us today in studios\nwe have expert Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:31.650\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.360\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing absolutely great,\nthank you Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.020\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good, thank you for asking.\n\n14\n00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.940\nSo Jo,\nwe left off talking about our SMS, but\n\n15\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.570\nwhere did we leave off and\nwhere will we begin for this show?\n\n16\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so yesterday we started off with\nlooking at service management system and\n\n17\n00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:51.303\nwe looked at obviously the concept of\nthe logical service management system.\n\n18\n00:00:51.303 --> 00:00:55.520\nAnd the fact that it is not\nactually an IT system, per se, and\n\n19\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.670\nit is not about the tools.\n\n20\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.390\nIt is actually about the way that we\nmanage and the way that we go in and\n\n21\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.540\nthe policies that we define and\nthe processes that we define for\n\n22\n00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.160\nour IT service providers.\n\n23\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.670\nSo yesterday we looked\nat establishing an SMS,\n\n24\n00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.780\nestablishing a service management system.\n\n25\n00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.630\nAnd in fact,\nwe finished off looking at the slide\n\n26\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.650\nthat's just appeared right now as if\nby magic, where we look at the Plan,\n\n27\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.570\nDo, Check, Act element of\nthe service management system.\n\n28\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.110\nIn other words,\nimplementing a service management system,\n\n29\n00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.410\nimplementing a protocol for\ngovernance and a protocol for\n\n30\n00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.360\nthe way that we manage our services,\nand our people, and our processes.\n\n31\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.170\nWell, it's not just a one off action.\n\n32\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.400\nIt's not something we can do and\nthen we can just forget about it.\n\n33\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.310\nWe have to ensure that we\nare subject to continual\n\n34\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.280\nimprovement because\nthe organization changes.\n\n35\n00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.290\nAnd so, on the right hand side there you\nhave what we might also call the Deming\n\n36\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.310\ncycle, which is that iterative cycle for\nimprovement where we plan for\n\n37\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.140\nimprovements, we plan for\nchanges, we do them.\n\n38\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.944\nWe've checked that they've worked.\n\n39\n00:02:08.944 --> 00:02:16.670\nAnd then we, from checking that they've\nworked, we can then take mediate action.\n\n40\n00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.610\nWe can then recommend further\nopportunities and ideas for improvement.\n\n41\n00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.830\nAnd that's part of the Act.\n\n42\n00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.860\nThe Act is looking for\nnew ways to improve.\n\n43\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.670\nSo we have to bear in mind that when we\ndefine our service management system and\n\n44\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.410\nour way of governing and\nour way of managing our IT services and\n\n45\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.640\ntheir processes and the people as well,\n\n46\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.895\nthen we have to bear in mind that\nthis has to be an iterative process.\n\n47\n00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.985\nThis is not something that's\njust a one-off experience.\n\n48\n00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:48.905\nSo this is what we finished\noff with yesterday.\n\n49\n00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:52.987\nJust looking at the iterative\nimplementation of our\n\n50\n00:02:52.987 --> 00:02:57.067\nservice management system and\nour way of managing.\n\n51\n00:02:57.067 --> 00:03:00.157\nAnd I know that it's really really easy,\nyou hear the word system and\n\n52\n00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:02.087\nyou automatically think, tools.\n\n53\n00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:06.777\nAnd of course, I'm gonna start off again\nin this particular episode with that\n\n54\n00:03:06.777 --> 00:03:09.487\nwarning that it's not\njust about the tools,\n\n55\n00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:13.797\nit's about the way of\nmanaging our IT services.\n\n56\n00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:18.477\nAnd of course, what we are auditing\nin our ISO 20000 audit,\n\n57\n00:03:18.477 --> 00:03:24.108\nwhich ISO 20000 sounds a lot\neasier than ISO/IEC 20000 2011.\n\n58\n00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:25.204\n&gt;&gt; It's true enough, Jo.\n\n59\n00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:28.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nwe'll stick with that one going forward.\n\n60\n00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.650\nBut in our ISO 20000 auditing,\n\n61\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.680\nwhat we are auditing is not that\nyou have a tool in place, but\n\n62\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.370\nwe're auditing that you have an entire\nsystem in place for managing IT and\n\n63\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.460\nthat you have all of the policies and\nthe processes and they're all documented.\n\n64\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.140\nAnd of course,\ndon't forget my constant nagging voice\n\n65\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.080\nthat will appear in your head every time\nyou approach an audit which is show me,\n\n66\n00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.970\nI want you to show me the evidence.\n\n67\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.150\nSo what about our service\nmanagement system then?\n\n68\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.290\nWell, what should our service\nmanagement system produce?\n\n69\n00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.430\nWell, what it should produce in\nthe outputs are our process plans,\n\n70\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.700\nand our plans for managing our services,\nand our plans for\n\n71\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700\nmeasuring those services as well.\n\n72\n00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.486\nThe service management\nsystem has to be planned.\n\n73\n00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:24.000\nI don't know that this sounds like\nwe're using just that word planning way\n\n74\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.330\ntoo much but\nI want to see evidence of that.\n\n75\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.815\nIf we are auditing you for ISO 20000, then\nwhat that means is that we are auditing to\n\n76\n00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:38.925\nensure that your service management system\nwas planned, that it didn't just happen.\n\n77\n00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:43.135\nThat you haven't just got a set\nof desperate processes and\n\n78\n00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:47.120\na set of desperate services and you really\ndon't know how anything is managed.\n\n79\n00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.520\nI want to see that you have got a plan for\nmanaging your services,\n\n80\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.720\nso that you've got a policy here in\nyour input center into this plan.\n\n81\n00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.810\nYou've got a policy, you understand your\nservice requirements, and, of course,\n\n82\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.030\nyou understand the ISO 20000\nPart 1 requirements as well.\n\n83\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.900\nThose mandatory requirements that\nyou will need to demonstrate\n\n84\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.100\nto an auditor that you are achieving.\n\n85\n00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.087\nAnd so, you'll create a plan for\nyour service management system.\n\n86\n00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:20.152\nSo as it says in the bullet points\nat the bottom, there's plans for\n\n87\n00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:21.750\nyour specific processes.\n\n88\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.570\nWell, they form part of the overall\nservice management plan.\n\n89\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.100\nThen, of course, like any single\ndocument and every single process and\n\n90\n00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.650\nevery single service,\nthey are subject to continual review.\n\n91\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.220\nThat's why we want to have\ncontinual improvement.\n\n92\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.990\nWe want to make sure, so as I have already\nsaid, that this is not a one of activity,\n\n93\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.620\nit is something that we\nare doing on a regular basis.\n\n94\n00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.555\nJust a quick question though Cherokee,\n\n95\n00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:56.182\nhow often do you think that I want to see\nevidence of you reviewing your plans?\n\n96\n00:05:56.182 --> 00:05:58.669\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n[LAUGH] at least quarterly and\n\n97\n00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:04.150\nanytime we're implementing a significant\nchange within our environment.\n\n98\n00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.620\n&gt;&gt; It depends on the scale of\nthe organization, to be honest.\n\n99\n00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.850\nI would say at least once a year.\n\n100\n00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.780\nPlans should be updated\nat least once a year, but\n\n101\n00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.380\nit does depend on the scale\nof the organization.\n\n102\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.835\nAnd an organization that\nis subject to rapid growth,\n\n103\n00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:22.180\nthen yes, we'd be looking for a more-\n&gt;&gt; A shorter interval.\n\n104\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.169\n&gt;&gt; More aggressive.\n\n105\n00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:23.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay, more aggressive.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n106\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.120\na more aggressive schedule for this.\n\n107\n00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.410\nBut don't forget though,\nwhen you're reviewing plans,\n\n108\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.960\nthat in itself is going to take time.\n\n109\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.660\nAnd so, if you are subject to rapid\ngrowth or if you're in a very very small\n\n110\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.010\norganization, then you don't always have\nthe time to review absolutely everything.\n\n111\n00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.330\nAnd maybe after three months you haven't\nquite got everything implemented, and\n\n112\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.830\nthen you're reviewing it again already.\n\n113\n00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n114\n00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so think sensibly and there is no\nset time frame for reviewing these plans.\n\n115\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.670\nYou're right about after any major change,\nmost definitely after any major change and\n\n116\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.420\nalso after any major disaster as well.\n\n117\n00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.180\nSo if we've had to invoke some\nform of service continuity or\n\n118\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.690\ndisaster recovery I expect to see\nplans reviewed at that point in time.\n\n119\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.630\nYou know the lessons learned?\n\n120\n00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.325\nBut yeah, after any major change,\nbut certainly at least once a year,\n\n121\n00:07:14.325 --> 00:07:17.290\nI'd expect to see that, as a bare minimum.\n\n122\n00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.150\nSure it could be more frequent, but bare\nin mind you don't wanna be too disruptive.\n\n123\n00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.381\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat you can continue to be productive and\n\n124\n00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:26.350\nnot worrying about reviewing or\ndoing the back end stuff.\n\n125\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.226\n&gt;&gt; Right and in terms of worrying about\ndoing these things, these things should be\n\n126\n00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:36.740\nfairly, well, I'm gonna see evidence of\nthat fact that they're very well-managed.\n\n127\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.668\nAnd so therefore,\n\n128\n00:07:37.668 --> 00:07:41.034\nit should be something that should\nhappen on a regular basis anyway.\n\n129\n00:07:41.034 --> 00:07:45.716\nThat if we've got the working\ndocument repository system,\n\n130\n00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:50.668\nif we have got the right plans in\nplace and the right SMS in place,\n\n131\n00:07:50.668 --> 00:07:55.716\nthen that SMS is going to facilitate\nus reviewing the plans anyway\n\n132\n00:07:55.716 --> 00:08:00.345\ncuz it's going to be Embedded\ninto the actual plan itself.\n\n133\n00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:04.906\nIt's gonna embedded into the service\nmanagement system that we\n\n134\n00:08:04.906 --> 00:08:09.140\nare going to review all of our plans and\nall of our policies.\n\n135\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.540\nSo we should be doing\nthis on a regular basis.\n\n136\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.730\nAnd all process owners\nshould be accountable for\n\n137\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.160\nreviewing our processes\non a regular basis.\n\n138\n00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.780\nAnd yes, in an order I wanna see\nevidence that they've been reviewed.\n\n139\n00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.850\nI wanna see evidence that they've been\nreviewed in the past and I also would\n\n140\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.260\nwanna see evidence that they are scheduled\nfor review in the future as well.\n\n141\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.040\nAll of this evidence has to be produced,\nand\n\n142\n00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.260\nthat's something that we have to bear\nin mind when it comes to ISO 20000.\n\n143\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.660\nIn an audit,\nwe've got to see the evidence of this.\n\n144\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.320\nSo it's not just enough to say,\nyeah we looked at that last week.\n\n145\n00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.630\nI wanna see some sort of documentary\nevidence on how we do that.\n\n146\n00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.790\nI mean when you think about this,\nhow do I know that you've read a document?\n\n147\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's some kind of quiz at the end\nto verify my absorption of the knowledge?\n\n148\n00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.380\n&gt;&gt; Kinda seems like a lot of effort.\n\n149\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n150\n00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.130\n&gt;&gt; Cuz somebody's got to compile a quiz.\n\n151\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.189\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo that.\n\n152\n00:09:10.189 --> 00:09:12.670\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Unless you trust me Joe.\n\n153\n00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, so how do I know then.\n\n154\n00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.680\nLet's say it was a service-level\nagreement document.\n\n155\n00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.090\nWe all know about\nservice-level agreements?\n\n156\n00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.660\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n157\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.850\n&gt;&gt; So let's say I wanted to check.\n\n158\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.660\nI ask you to show me evidence that\nservice-level agreement document has\n\n159\n00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.670\nbeen reviewed at least every year.\n\n160\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.110\nHow are you gonna do that?\n\n161\n00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:36.950\n&gt;&gt; I could provide reports if it\nwere something that I was, like,\n\n162\n00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:37.970\nmonitoring actively.\n\n163\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:38.470\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n164\n00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:44.240\nSo you'd provide reports on what,\nthe fact that I opened the document, or\n\n165\n00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.750\nyou'd provide reports on the fact\nthat I'd updated the document and\n\n166\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.270\nthen saved it as another version?\n\n167\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.420\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking if I review it\nyou're not asking me then to provide\n\n168\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.190\nmy monitoring skills.\n\n169\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.980\nI'm reviewing it to be sure that\nwe're in compliance with this SLA or\n\n170\n00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.980\njust the fact that we've\nactually read the SLA.\n\n171\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.280\n&gt;&gt; Right now there's a difference and\nI'm glad you mentioned that.\n\n172\n00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.720\nThere is a distinct difference, especially\nwhen it comes to service level management.\n\n173\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.070\nWe're not reviewing the document for\ncompliance with the service level targets.\n\n174\n00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:14.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n175\n00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.540\n&gt;&gt; That's done in\nthe service review meeting.\n\n176\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthat's what the reports I was thinking of-\n\n177\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, right, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.040\nSo what I'm looking at is I want\nyou to review this document to say,\n\n179\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.630\nis this document still relevant?\n\n180\n00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.500\nAre the targets still\nrelevant in this document?\n\n181\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.030\n&gt;&gt; I could send read receipts.\n\n182\n00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.480\nBut that just means you've opened it.\n\n183\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.190\nIt doesn't mean you've read and\ncomprehended it.\n\n184\n00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.815\n&gt;&gt; And this is not me trying to awkward.\n\n185\n00:10:36.815 --> 00:10:39.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to come up with answers here\n\n186\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.750\nfor you, because I'm not really sure.\n\n187\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.260\nAnd that's the difficulty that\na lot of organizations have.\n\n188\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.960\nAnd this is why, and I didn't script\nany of this with Cherokee by the way.\n\n189\n00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.030\nAnd there's a reason why I don't do this,\n\n190\n00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.050\nbecause this is the challenge\nthat a lot of organizations have.\n\n191\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.840\nBecause I'll walk in, and\nI will say to you, right,\n\n192\n00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.000\nshow me that you've\nreviewed these documents.\n\n193\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.735\nAnd they look at me like Cherokee's\nlooking at me right now.\n\n194\n00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:02.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How do I do that?\n\n195\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:09.025\nHow do I show you that I've read\na document, but that's what I need to see.\n\n196\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.620\nSo you can imagine now, when you just\nthink about one little thing like that,\n\n197\n00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.710\nyou can imagine now actually how\nmuch of a challenge it is for\n\n198\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.070\norganizations to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n199\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.990\nBecause all of that evidence\nhas got to be available\n\n200\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.100\nto an auditor so that they can see\nthat a document has been reviewed.\n\n201\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.077\n&gt;&gt; Well, what do we have, witnesses?\n\n202\n00:11:32.077 --> 00:11:33.800\nAre they able to be accountable here?\n\n203\n00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.160\nSecurity camera footage,\nI don't know [LAUGH].\n\n204\n00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.740\n&gt;&gt; With the right document\nrepository system actually,\n\n205\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.310\nyou can check documents out and\nthen you can update them.\n\n206\n00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.320\nAnd what I'd be looking for\nare things like a version control.\n\n207\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.100\nSo I'd be looking for a reversion history.\n\n208\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.700\nAnd I would be looking to see that that\ndocument has been not just changed,\n\n209\n00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.910\nbut at least the document has\nbeen reviewed once a year.\n\n210\n00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So what I'd be looking for\n\n211\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.590\nis part of your document\nrepository system.\n\n212\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:06.807\nAnd this is why the document\nrepository system is really,\n\n213\n00:12:06.807 --> 00:12:09.155\nreally very useful to us.\n\n214\n00:12:09.155 --> 00:12:11.406\nI mean we don't tell you that\nyou have to have one, but\n\n215\n00:12:11.406 --> 00:12:14.660\nwe'll tell you that you have to have\nevidence, so something like SharePoint\n\n216\n00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.720\nthat has a checkout-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n217\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.590\n&gt;&gt; And check in.\n\n218\n00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.750\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was thinking.\n\n219\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, it sort of has a check in,\ncheckout, and check in facility and\n\n220\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.970\nit'll also tell you whether\na document has been updated or not.\n\n221\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:24.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n222\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.370\n&gt;&gt; And so what we're looking for\nis evidence, and\n\n223\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:30.330\nit could be something simple like\na log file to say that, yes,\n\n224\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:35.590\nthis document was updated and we can\nsee the revision history of a document.\n\n225\n00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.290\nNow the easiest thing for you to do and\n\n226\n00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.250\nthis is just me being\npractical about this.\n\n227\n00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.070\nThe easiest thing for you to do is to make\nsure that maybe every year you change\n\n228\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.540\nthe version number of a document.\n\n229\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n230\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.700\n&gt;&gt; And so that we can set up in our\ndocument repository systems, we can\n\n231\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.460\nset up a flag so that once a year, or if a\ndocument hasn't been reviewed for a year,\n\n232\n00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.340\nthen it will flag up and say, hey this\ndocument hasn't been changed in a year.\n\n233\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.400\nYou might need to review this.\n\n234\n00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.700\nThat's the sort of evidence\nthat we're looking for.\n\n235\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.630\nSo yes, when I say to you about the\nservice management system is not a tool.\n\n236\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.833\nIt's not about actual\nIT systems themselves.\n\n237\n00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:15.244\nThat's the sort of evidence that\nwe're looking for though and\n\n238\n00:13:15.244 --> 00:13:17.420\ntools are going to help you with this.\n\n239\n00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.950\n&gt;&gt; Especially not to underestimate\nthat metadata there.\n\n240\n00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.140\n&gt;&gt; Right and so\nwhen I say to you show me I mean it.\n\n241\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n242\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.420\n&gt;&gt; I don't mean just sort of tell me.\n\n243\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.200\nI mean show me.\n\n244\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.720\nShow me physical evidence that you have\n\n245\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.800\nbeen updating these documents\non a regular basis.\n\n246\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:39.280\nAnd a lot of organizations don't realize\nthe amount of work that there is involved\n\n247\n00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.655\nin achieving ISO 20000 purely because\nwe want to see evidence of all of this.\n\n248\n00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.780\nWhich means that you have to have\nthe relevant tools in place.\n\n249\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.760\nThis is not just as simple as\ntaking ITIL and cutting and\n\n250\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.982\npasting ITIL processes out of a book and\nthen plugging them into your organization\n\n251\n00:13:57.982 --> 00:14:00.150\nand said, hey look there we go,\nwe can achieve ISO 20000.\n\n252\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:05.000\nIt's not that simple cuz we want\nto see documentary evidence that\n\n253\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.620\nabsolutely everything is working.\n\n254\n00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.580\nShow me.\n\n255\n00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.980\nSo what should the SMS then contain?\n\n256\n00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.320\nOur service management system.\n\n257\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.430\nAnd I've already talked about policies and\n\n258\n00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:22.020\nI've talked about process documentation,\nbut just look at the other things here.\n\n259\n00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:27.190\nThings like required resources,\nthe skills that everybody needs.\n\n260\n00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.140\nRisk management.\n\n261\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.726\nWhat about supporting technology\nthat everybody needs to use?\n\n262\n00:14:31.726 --> 00:14:36.820\nAny contracts that we have in place,\nreally this is how we manage our IT.\n\n263\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.457\nWho's got what job,\nwho sits in what role and\n\n264\n00:14:40.457 --> 00:14:43.917\nwhat skills do they\nneed to form that role?\n\n265\n00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:48.170\nAnd what about the skills that are needed\nto perform roles within processes and\n\n266\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.370\nnot just within services for instance?\n\n267\n00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.729\nYour SMS should contain everything,\neverything that we need to manage IT.\n\n268\n00:14:57.729 --> 00:15:02.576\nAnd so, of course,\nwhen we implement our SMS, then, well,\n\n269\n00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:07.519\nwe have to ensure that it's designed\nin a way that everybody can\n\n270\n00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:12.205\naccess the information that's\ncontained within out SMS.\n\n271\n00:15:12.205 --> 00:15:15.250\nBut don't forget our SMS is\njust not about the information,\n\n272\n00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.170\nit's about our way of working, too.\n\n273\n00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.570\nSo when we implement the SMS,\n\n274\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:25.810\nwe've got to make sure we've got\nthe right budget to be able to manage IT.\n\n275\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.140\nAnd that we've got the right people\nin place to be able to manage IT.\n\n276\n00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.407\nAnd when we operate the SMS, well,\n\n277\n00:15:33.407 --> 00:15:38.367\nwe've still got to carry on in showing\nthat we've got the right money and\n\n278\n00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:42.756\nthe right skills and the right\npeople to be able to manage IT, and\n\n279\n00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:47.797\nthat we are monitoring the way IT works\nas a whole, the way our SMS works and\n\n280\n00:15:47.797 --> 00:15:51.973\nthat we're making recommendations for\nimprovement of IT.\n\n281\n00:15:51.973 --> 00:15:53.852\nAnd we have to as we've already said,\n\n282\n00:15:53.852 --> 00:15:56.451\ncarry on monitor in our\nservice management system.\n\n283\n00:15:56.451 --> 00:16:01.926\nIn other words,\nmonitoring the way that IT works.\n\n284\n00:16:01.926 --> 00:16:04.422\nBut when it comes to your audit,\n\n285\n00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:09.480\nwe're checking that all of\nthese exist in your audit.\n\n286\n00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.620\nAnd so really what you should have is, and\n\n287\n00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.019\nwe've talked about internal\naudits previous episodes,\n\n288\n00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:22.900\nwhat you should have is some mechanism\nto identify non-conformities.\n\n289\n00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.942\nBecause don't forget, you'll have your\naudit and it's not just a one-off audit.\n\n290\n00:16:27.942 --> 00:16:31.120\nI achieved ISO 20000 in 2015.\n\n291\n00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.086\nYou've got to carry on\nachieving ISO 20000.\n\n292\n00:16:35.086 --> 00:16:40.670\nSo should a non-conformity pop up,\nyou've gotta do something about it.\n\n293\n00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.210\nOtherwise the next time you receive it,\n\n294\n00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:47.460\nthe next time you have a full audit you're\nnot going to actually make the grade,\n\n295\n00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.475\nand that means that your ISO 20000\ncertification will be taken from you.\n\n296\n00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.220\nAll audits should be documented,\nwhether it's an external audit,\n\n297\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.610\nwhether it's an internal audit.\n\n298\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.910\nWhether it's your, we call the top-up\naudits that happen every year,\n\n299\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:08.820\nthe one where we'll audit just to make\nsure you're staying on the right track.\n\n300\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.920\nOr whether it's the actual three year full\naudit, everything should be documented.\n\n301\n00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.080\nAnd all the results should be recorded and\n\n302\n00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.770\ncommunicated to all those stakeholders\nthat need to have access to it.\n\n303\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.850\nThese results and\nthe results of your internal audits and\n\n304\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:31.110\nthe results of your monitoring,\nwell, they should perform,\n\n305\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:36.060\nor form rather,\npart of input into management reviews.\n\n306\n00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:41.900\nThey should form sort of, well input\ninto opportunities for improvement.\n\n307\n00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.070\nBecause this is where we want to improve,\n\n308\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:48.230\nand this is where we've gotta\naddress those non-conformities.\n\n309\n00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.370\nDon't forget,\nimprovement of the way we manage IT\n\n310\n00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:55.800\nis not just about ticking\na box in an audit, either.\n\n311\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.990\nBecause if our business have changed and\nour IT services have changed,\n\n312\n00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.640\nthen we have got to change\nthe way we manage IT.\n\n313\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.550\nThat could have a huge\ndetrimental impact on an audit.\n\n314\n00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.170\nIt could have a positive\nimpact on an audit too.\n\n315\n00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:16.220\nBut every change we make to IT,\nwe've also got to think then about\n\n316\n00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.940\nour accreditation and\nhow that change affects our accreditation.\n\n317\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:25.890\nUltimately, what we want to do with\nISO 20000 is we just want to ensure\n\n318\n00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:31.420\nthat you're demonstrating efficient and\neffective management of your IT services,\n\n319\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.520\nand so this audit is a way for\nyou to demonstrate that.\n\n320\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.540\nBut if you suddenly become inefficient\nbecause you've changed something,\n\n321\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.355\nthen obviously that's\ngoing to be flagged up and\n\n322\n00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:47.730\nour management need to understand\nexactly what's going on,\n\n323\n00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.160\nbecause they need to make\nthe decision as to how to improve.\n\n324\n00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.390\nSo all of these on our left-hand side\nare inputs into management review.\n\n325\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:01.590\nThis is what they discuss when\ndeciding on what improvements to make.\n\n326\n00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.540\nBearing in mind that whatever\nimprovements that are made, well,\n\n327\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.190\nwe have to ensure that they\nare ISO 20000 compliant.\n\n328\n00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:14.780\nAnd of course we also wanna see,\nshow me, right?\n\n329\n00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.600\nThe evidence of management\nreview meetings.\n\n330\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.529\nSo I wanna see that they're happening\non a regular basis as well.\n\n331\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.810\nJust imagine all of that documentation,\n\n332\n00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.370\njust imagine everything\nthat I'm gonna ask to see.\n\n333\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:31.350\nEverything that I'm gonna say show me,\nand that's what Part 1 is.\n\n334\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.230\nPart 1 is the Shall,\nit's the 259 mandatory requirements.\n\n335\n00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.420\nThese are the things that you\nare going to have to show me,\n\n336\n00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.330\nthese are the things that you\nare going to have to show the auditor.\n\n337\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.020\nThis are the things that\nyou've got to be prepared for.\n\n338\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:52.123\nSo, as I've already mentioned in previous\nepisodes, you can perform internal audit.\n\n339\n00:19:52.123 --> 00:19:56.025\nIf you're going to perform\nan internal audit for your ISO 20000,\n\n340\n00:19:56.025 --> 00:20:00.264\nthen I'd definitely recommend, and\nI know that I've said this in the past.\n\n341\n00:20:00.264 --> 00:20:04.280\nI definitely recommend\nthat you have an auditor,\n\n342\n00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:09.253\na designated person within your\norganisation who is actually\n\n343\n00:20:09.253 --> 00:20:13.093\ntrained to ISO 20000 auditor standards.\n\n344\n00:20:13.093 --> 00:20:19.081\nAnd therefore, somebody who is able to\ncome and to actually perform the audit for\n\n345\n00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:22.955\nyou, bearing in mind that\nwith an internal person,\n\n346\n00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:25.700\nan internal person could be biased.\n\n347\n00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.370\nThey could have difficulty\nwith remaining objective.\n\n348\n00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.180\nThere's nothing wrong with that, so\nplease don't take them outside and\n\n349\n00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.215\nbeat them with a baseball bat.\n\n350\n00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:40.490\n[LAUGH] Because we all feel the same,\nwe all feel loyal to our company and\n\n351\n00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.020\nwe all feel protective of our company.\n\n352\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.970\nAnd we all want our\ncompany to perform well.\n\n353\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.230\n&gt;&gt; Be successful in the audit.\n\n354\n00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.270\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nof course if you are an internal auditor,\n\n355\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:56.910\nin some respects the responsibility for\nachieving that audit or\n\n356\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:02.800\nfor attaining the audit or retaining\nthe certification lies on your shoulders.\n\n357\n00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.616\nSo you're gonna do anything\nthat you can to get us\n\n358\n00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:07.710\nthrough-\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n359\n00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.650\nespecially if you're the one\nwho have implemented\n\n360\n00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.350\nthose particular check points or\ncheck sums there, then you're gonna\n\n361\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.770\nthink that it's great because you're\nnot getting a different perspective.\n\n362\n00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.900\nAnd we see this a lot even with\nlike penetration testing when\n\n363\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.680\nwe're talking about security.\n\n364\n00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd\n\n365\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.560\nthis is where you'll get people that\nwill say, well, I thought about this but\n\n366\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.790\nI didn't think it was important.\n\n367\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.590\nWell, maybe you did consider this, but\n\n368\n00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.670\nthen what you need to do is you need to\ndocument that you've considered this.\n\n369\n00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.330\nWhether you thought it was important or\nnot, that needs to be documented.\n\n370\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.580\nSo, there's nothing wrong\nwith an internal auditor, and\n\n371\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.400\nwe'll tell you that internal\nauditors should be, they should have\n\n372\n00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.590\nthe relevant qualifications to perform\nbe able to perform the internal auditor.\n\n373\n00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.380\nThere's also nothing wrong with\ngetting an outside person.\n\n374\n00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.536\nAnd we know that an external consultant\nprior to your official ITIL audit, and\n\n375\n00:21:57.536 --> 00:22:01.280\nexternal consultant is probably going to\nbe more expensive than an internal audit.\n\n376\n00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.370\nBut an external consultant will\ngive you an objective viewpoint.\n\n377\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.680\nBut I have come across situations,\nand I can say this.\n\n378\n00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.290\nWhen we're talking about here about\nobjectivity and impartiality,\n\n379\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.320\nI have come across situations where\nI have gone into organizations.\n\n380\n00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.870\nAnd I have said, this isn't going\nto pass and this is going to fail.\n\n381\n00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.910\nAnd we need to work on this.\n\n382\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.650\nAnd we need to do something about this.\n\n383\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.860\nAnd they have turned around to me and\nsaid, no I don't believe that.\n\n384\n00:22:29.405 --> 00:22:32.070\nOkay, but what do you want me to say?\n\n385\n00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.742\n&gt;&gt; And why are they paying for\nyou to come there?\n\n386\n00:22:34.742 --> 00:22:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I mean,\nyou don't ever wanna turn around and say-\n\n387\n00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.120\n&gt;&gt; If you're not willing to take\n\n388\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.350\nthe advice, I mean, that seems like\na waste of money in my opinion, but.\n\n389\n00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:46.220\n&gt;&gt; But sometimes organizations\njust really don't realize.\n\n390\n00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.850\nI'm not gonna say how bad they are,\nbut, I mean,\n\n391\n00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.500\nsometimes organizations don't\nreally see they're failing.\n\n392\n00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.310\nOr they like to think that\ntheir failings aren't failings.\n\n393\n00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.300\nYou know, the old,\nwe always have a joke in IT, don't we?\n\n394\n00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.570\nAbout the fact that when certain companies\nrelease a new product, a new patch or\n\n395\n00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.620\nwhatever, they don't release\nit with known errors.\n\n396\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.840\nThey release it with features, because\nthat's the way it's been marketed, okay?\n\n397\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.700\nYes we've released these features.\n\n398\n00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:18.000\nIt's exactly the same way when it comes to\nyour organization in achieving any sort of\n\n399\n00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.230\naccreditation or any sort of audit.\n\n400\n00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.100\nWe tend to have a very,\n\n401\n00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.190\nlet's just say that we look at our own\norganization with rose-tinted glasses on.\n\n402\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.990\nWe really, really do.\n\n403\n00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:33.660\nAnd so, in that instance then it\ncan be very, very difficult for\n\n404\n00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.240\nan external consultant to come in,\nprovide that impartiality, and\n\n405\n00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.740\nthen to be confronted with\nthe no I don't believe you.\n\n406\n00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.388\nAnd it's at that point in time where we\nkinda have to say to you, well, okay,\n\n407\n00:23:48.388 --> 00:23:53.181\nthen fine, but then you're gonna waste\nthousands of dollars on having an audit\n\n408\n00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:54.911\nthat you're going to fail.\n\n409\n00:23:54.911 --> 00:23:59.845\nSo you can either choose to believe me and\nwe can do something about it,\n\n410\n00:23:59.845 --> 00:24:04.027\nor trust us that we are being\ncompletely honest in this, And\n\n411\n00:24:04.027 --> 00:24:09.400\nwe can work out various ways around this,\nbut you have to trust us with this.\n\n412\n00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.830\nAnd so it can be a challenge.\n\n413\n00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.650\nMaking that decision for\n\n414\n00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.880\nan organization as to whether they want to\nuse an internal auditor or whether they\n\n415\n00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.570\nwant to bring in an external consultant to\nhelp them prepare for an ISO 20000 audit.\n\n416\n00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.370\nThat's something that only you can decide.\n\n417\n00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.850\nOnly you know your internal audit process.\n\n418\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.130\nOnly you know your internal auditor.\n\n419\n00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.640\nAnd only you know whether an external\nperson will be brought in and\n\n420\n00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.980\ntreated as a member of the team.\n\n421\n00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.500\nNonconformities have got to\nbe communicated, whether it's\n\n422\n00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.680\ncome from an external auditor or an\nexternal consultant or somebody internal.\n\n423\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.290\nAnd corrective actions have to be taken.\n\n424\n00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:53.190\nSo whether you choose to believe them or\nnot, we've got to do something about it.\n\n425\n00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.190\nAnd then we've got to\nimplement the improvements.\n\n426\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.230\nSo we have to ensure that we have\na policy for continual improvement and\n\n427\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.790\nthat we've got people with the right\nauthority to be able to identify and\n\n428\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.650\nto be able to implement improvements.\n\n429\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:13.004\nAnd that all improvement is documented\nincluding why we've got non-conformities,\n\n430\n00:25:13.004 --> 00:25:17.634\nand what we're doing about actually\nrectifying the non-conformities.\n\n431\n00:25:19.076 --> 00:25:21.516\nAnd you have to have,\nas I've already said,\n\n432\n00:25:21.516 --> 00:25:24.601\nthe people that have the authority\nto make the decision,\n\n433\n00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:28.410\nto prioritize the opportunities and\nto implement the improvements.\n\n434\n00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.580\nAnd improvements have got to be an\nimprovement in terms of either quality or\n\n435\n00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.090\nvalue or maybe an improvement for\nproductivity and improvement in cost.\n\n436\n00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.855\nBecause we're going to be able to\nidentify whether an improvement\n\n437\n00:25:41.855 --> 00:25:44.905\nhas been made just to\ncheck a box in the audit.\n\n438\n00:25:44.905 --> 00:25:47.775\nWe can identify that, we can tell\n\n439\n00:25:47.775 --> 00:25:51.755\nwhether you have made an improvement just\nbecause you want to get passed an audit,\n\n440\n00:25:51.755 --> 00:25:56.605\nor whether you need an improvement\nbecause it makes your IT services better.\n\n441\n00:25:56.605 --> 00:26:01.705\nWe can tell that,\nbecause we're not completely blind.\n\n442\n00:26:01.705 --> 00:26:05.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Although sometimes, I feel like it.\n\n443\n00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.770\nI know that, especially with\nthe lights in the studio here, right?\n\n444\n00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.370\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n445\n00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.780\n&gt;&gt; You have to ensure that whatever\n\n446\n00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.020\nimprovement you make is\nnot just to check a box.\n\n447\n00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.970\nYou have to ensure that whatever\nimprovement that you make\n\n448\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:22.490\nto your IT services and to the way\nyou manage your IT services is going\n\n449\n00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:27.620\nto be an improvement to your delivery\nof value to your organization.\n\n450\n00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.190\nAnd whilst we can stand here and\ntalk about achieving an audit.\n\n451\n00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.220\nAt the end of the day, this is all about\ndelivering value to your organization.\n\n452\n00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.910\nAnd the only purpose of the audit is just\nto demonstrate that you are actually\n\n453\n00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:39.830\ndelivering value.\n\n454\n00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.690\nSo at this point in time we've taken\na look at our service management system.\n\n455\n00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:49.310\nAnd now for our subsequent episodes, in\nour following episodes we're going to be\n\n456\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:53.190\nlooking at clauses five\nthrough to clause nine\n\n457\n00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:58.290\nof our part one which is where we look\nat the processes that will be audited.\n\n458\n00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:58.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n459\n00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.840\nSo we've done clause four and\nthen we'll be picking up with clause five.\n\n460\n00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.170\nA lot of clauses here, but\nwe're not talking Santa Claus or Krampus.\n\n461\n00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.795\nI know we've even joked about that.\n\n462\n00:27:08.795 --> 00:27:09.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n463\n00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.470\nwe do have some more ISO\n20000 headed your way.\n\n464\n00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.460\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n465\n00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.000\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n466\n00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n467\n00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.468\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n468\n00:27:20.468 --> 00:27:26.490\n[MUSIC]\n\n469\n00:27:26.490 -->

00:00:07.722\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.899\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:17.741\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your ISO/IEC\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:19.643\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:22.689\nIn this episode,\nwe're taking a look at Clause 5,\n\n8\n00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.985\nspecifically Design and Transition.\n\n9\n00:00:24.985 --> 00:00:29.290\nAnd back with us today in studios,\nwe have ISO expert Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.930\nThanks for joining us today, Jo.\n\n11\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.650\n&gt;&gt; That's great, thank you Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.155\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:38.164\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well so, we were joking\naround at the end of the last show about\n\n14\n00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:39.820\ndifferent types of clauses.\n\n15\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.800\nWe're not talking Santa Claus,\nwe just finished Clause 4.\n\n16\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.210\nWhat are we gonna be looking\nat here with design?\n\n17\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.357\nFirst I think that's where we're starting,\nright?\n\n18\n00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:51.708\n&gt;&gt; We're starting off with the design and\ntransition of new and changed services.\n\n19\n00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:56.523\nFirst thing that I want to mention is,\nand I will say this at the beginning of\n\n20\n00:00:56.523 --> 00:01:01.493\nevery single section, to be honest,\nevery single episode is the fact that,\n\n21\n00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:06.820\ndon't forget we're in a standard,\nwe're in an order preparation show.\n\n22\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.632\nSo, what this means is this,\n\n23\n00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:12.699\nis what I'm doing here is I'm not\nshowing you how to do something.\n\n24\n00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:17.397\nWhat I'm talking about, or what we're\ndiscussing here Is how to prepare for\n\n25\n00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:21.894\nan audit and what we're looking at is\nwhat sort of things will be audited.\n\n26\n00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:28.147\nAnd so this particular class is useful for\nyou in your organization if you\n\n27\n00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:33.600\nare thinking of trying attain\nISO 20000 certification.\n\n28\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.540\nBut also this particular\nshow is useful for\n\n29\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.290\nall of those who are affected by\nan organization who is achieving or\n\n30\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.810\nworking towards ISO 20000\ncertification right now.\n\n31\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.820\nSo it may be that your management\nare looking to implement ISO 20000.\n\n32\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.974\nSo what this particular show will\ntell you, and what this episode\n\n33\n00:01:55.974 --> 00:02:01.032\nwill tell you, is exactly what it\nis an auditor is looking for and\n\n34\n00:02:01.032 --> 00:02:06.200\nwhat we are checking against\nin order to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n35\n00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.816\nSo really,\n\n36\n00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:10.587\nthis is sort of just preparation\nthat's why this is a foundation class.\n\n37\n00:02:10.587 --> 00:02:14.767\nThis is just preparation for, this is\nwhat we're looking for in an audit.\n\n38\n00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:18.983\nSo yes in this particular episode\nwe're looking at the design and\n\n39\n00:02:18.983 --> 00:02:24.270\ntransition of neuro change services so\nwhat we're gonna be covering is exactly,\n\n40\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.039\nwhat we look for when we audit,\nthis particular section.\n\n41\n00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n42\n00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.921\n&gt;&gt; So the screen that we have right in\nfront of you right now, is actually,\n\n43\n00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:35.093\nI love this, I really love this screen.\n\n44\n00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:36.413\n&gt;&gt; I know, we saw this before.\n\n45\n00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:39.949\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is actually our\nService Management System.\n\n46\n00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.821\nAnd our Service Management System in\na nutshell, don't forget in our previous\n\n47\n00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:47.657\nepisodes we've told you that when we\nrefer to the Service Management System.\n\n48\n00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:53.325\nWe are referring to the logical concept of\nall of the processes and the policies and\n\n49\n00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:59.420\nthe governance and documentation that's\ninvolved in managing our services.\n\n50\n00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.130\nAnd right now what we're looking at is\nwe're looking specifically at the area\n\n51\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.250\nin pink.\n\n52\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.690\nWhich is the, in the pale pink,\nthe baby pink if we wanna call it that,\n\n53\n00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.940\nwhich is the design and\ntransition of new or changed services.\n\n54\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.361\nAnd you'll see that within that,\nwe've got our service delivery services.\n\n55\n00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:21.132\nSorry, our service delivery processes,\nour control processes,\n\n56\n00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:25.670\nour resolution processes, and\nour relationship processes as well.\n\n57\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.840\nNow, as I already mentioned,\n\n58\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.750\nwe're not gonna teach you how\nto use each of these processes.\n\n59\n00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.170\nThis is not a class where we will cover\nhow we implement these processes.\n\n60\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.253\nWhat we're covering here is what we're\nactually auditing for in these processes.\n\n61\n00:03:43.253 --> 00:03:46.630\nNow, here's another slide\nthat I really like.\n\n62\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.137\nAnd this slide here is well,\nthis slide is from, and\n\n63\n00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:53.584\nit tells you at the bottom there,\nit's from ITIL.\n\n64\n00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:56.313\nThis one,\na copyright on this one is 2011, but\n\n65\n00:03:56.313 --> 00:04:00.540\ntrust me these slide has been around\nsince, way before version three of ITIL.\n\n66\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.941\nThis slide has been around since version\ntwo of ITIL and I absolutely love it,\n\n67\n00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:07.525\nit's my favorite slide\nin the whole of ITIL.\n\n68\n00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:12.542\nBecause this one tells me what happens\nin the ITIL life cycle phases, and\n\n69\n00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:17.550\nthe exactly what is going on throughout\neach of this life cycle phases.\n\n70\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.770\nSo, let me take a look at this.\n\n71\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.252\nI'll start off with,\n\n72\n00:04:21.252 --> 00:04:25.397\nwe know that in strategy this\nwhere we document requirements.\n\n73\n00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:30.316\nAnd in ITIL service design, this is just\nwhere we design a solution we produce what\n\n74\n00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:32.545\nwe call our service design package.\n\n75\n00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:36.906\nThink of this as our blueprint to\nmove forward our blueprint for\n\n76\n00:04:36.906 --> 00:04:38.891\nwhat we're going to build.\n\n77\n00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:42.284\nAnd then here,\nwe have service transition and\n\n78\n00:04:42.284 --> 00:04:46.840\nthis is where we do our build and\ntest and our deployment.\n\n79\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.304\nNotice that moving in to operation,\n\n80\n00:04:49.304 --> 00:04:53.043\nwe have something called\nan early life support period.\n\n81\n00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:57.376\nAnd notice that the projecting\nwho will take all or initiate and\n\n82\n00:04:57.376 --> 00:04:59.430\nmanage most of the elements.\n\n83\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.582\nNot the operation elements but\ncertainly the design and\n\n84\n00:05:02.582 --> 00:05:06.137\ndevelopment elements of strategy and\ndesign and transition,\n\n85\n00:05:06.137 --> 00:05:09.166\nthey don't run away as soon\nas it comes to operation.\n\n86\n00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:13.337\nAnd that's probably one of the biggest\nmisconceptions when it comes to IT's that\n\n87\n00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:17.280\nwe like to throw things over the fence\nat the operations guys absolutely not.\n\n88\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.570\nIn this early life support period,\n\n89\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.830\nwell this is where we work hand in hand\nwith the project team and operations.\n\n90\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.010\nYou can call this DevOps if you\nlike DevOps is concept that is,\n\n91\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.900\nlet's just say that that's on\nthe up I'd say within ITIL.\n\n92\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.070\nIt's certainly something that\nwe're talking about a lot within\n\n93\n00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.880\nthe IT environment now.\n\n94\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.480\nWith DevOps, is that synergy\nbetween the project team here and\n\n95\n00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.470\noperations here, and\nat the end of this early\n\n96\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.030\nlife support this is when our\nservice level agreements are signed.\n\n97\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.563\nAnd then we move into continual\nservice improvement here within ITIL.\n\n98\n00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.511\nIn other words this is our\noperating environment and\n\n99\n00:05:58.511 --> 00:06:02.940\nthis is where we start to improve on\neverything that we have just implemented.\n\n100\n00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.811\nSo the scope,\nas it says here of ISO 20000 well,\n\n101\n00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:14.400\nall of these clause actually cover\nall of these life of the service,\n\n102\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.771\nthey cover this life cycle.\n\n103\n00:06:16.771 --> 00:06:19.052\nNow we're not gonna be testing ITIL,\n\n104\n00:06:19.052 --> 00:06:22.270\nwe're not gonna be auditing ITIL,\nabsolutely not.\n\n105\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.948\nAnd you don't have to have\nan ITIL based framework\n\n106\n00:06:24.948 --> 00:06:27.639\nimplemented in order to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n107\n00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.658\nAs I've said previously in previous\nepisodes though it will help you.\n\n108\n00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:37.525\nAnd so what do I just want you to\ntake way from this particular slide\n\n109\n00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:42.920\nis the fact that this is the ITIL\nconcept of a service life cycle.\n\n110\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.011\nAnd we will be auditing against all of\nthe elements that are contained in here.\n\n111\n00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:52.629\nSo right the way from strategy\nthrough design and transition and\n\n112\n00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:55.970\noperation, as you have seen them in ITIL.\n\n113\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.330\nThrough into continual\nservice improvement,\n\n114\n00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.106\nwe can audit all of those elements.\n\n115\n00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:03.616\nNow whether you've got an ITIL\nbased framework in place or not,\n\n116\n00:07:03.616 --> 00:07:07.971\nthose elements still need to be in place\nin order for you to achieve conformity,\n\n117\n00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:10.380\nin order for you to achieve certification.\n\n118\n00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.469\nSo here we have then right now\nwe're looking at service design and\n\n119\n00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.173\ntransition of new and change services.\n\n120\n00:07:19.173 --> 00:07:22.880\nSo this happens here, the design and\nthe transition of new and\n\n121\n00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.600\nchange services, it happens at this point.\n\n122\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.460\nYou'll see that this is sort of\nthe bulk of what's happening within\n\n123\n00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:37.170\nour service life cycle as it were,\nwithin our service provider organization.\n\n124\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.544\n&gt;&gt; So I could imagine a lot of time should\nbe spent here to make sure that all\n\n125\n00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.119\nthe appropriate documents I mean,\n\n126\n00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:46.861\nthere's gonna be a lot of work going on in\nthis particular section here in Clause 5.\n\n127\n00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:50.875\n&gt;&gt; There certainly is however,\n\n128\n00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:55.530\nISO 20000 is the standard for\n\n129\n00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.589\nservice management.\n\n130\n00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:01.406\nYou have to bear in mind that if we\njust go back to that last slide,\n\n131\n00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:04.694\nyou have to bear in mind that The design\nand transition generally happens or\n\n132\n00:08:04.694 --> 00:08:07.140\ngenerally is undertaken\nby the project team.\n\n133\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.110\nAnd there isn't an international\nstandard for project managements.\n\n134\n00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, so in my mind I'm thinking like\nDMAIC process, I'm looking there and\n\n135\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.990\nI'm like well maybe that goes\nin that first gray bar there,\n\n136\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.479\nthe arrow at the top or something.\n\n137\n00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does.\n\n138\n00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.890\n&gt;&gt; But, it could easily be interchanged\nwith some other discipline as well.\n\n139\n00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n140\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.150\nSo when we're talking about,\nI mean, you mentioned DMAIC.\n\n141\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.810\nWhen we talk about Agile,\nwhen we talk about\n\n142\n00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.030\nother project management\nmethodologies such as PRINCE2 or PMP,\n\n143\n00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.840\nthen we're not going to tell you how\nto design and transition your services.\n\n144\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.700\nWe're not going to tell you\nhow to do project management.\n\n145\n00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.658\nWe will, but\nwe'll do that in other shows [LAUGH].\n\n146\n00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:49.180\nWe cove project management in other shows,\nbut we don't cover it here.\n\n147\n00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.920\nHere, we're looking purely at\nthe operational side of this.\n\n148\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.970\nSo in exactly the same way as with ITIL,\n\n149\n00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.197\nwe looked at throughout design we looked\nat things like capacity, designing for\n\n150\n00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:02.205\ncapacity, and\ndesign in the operational aspect.\n\n151\n00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:06.785\nSo designing availability and\ndesigning for continuity, etc.\n\n152\n00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:11.665\nWe're not looking at actually\ndeveloping that new piece of software.\n\n153\n00:09:11.665 --> 00:09:13.345\nAnd it's the same within transition,\n\n154\n00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:18.090\nwe're not looking, we're not concentrating\non developing that piece of software.\n\n155\n00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.780\nThat's what the project team will do.\n\n156\n00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.510\nBut we're looking to insure that\nchange management is involved.\n\n157\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.800\nWe're looking to insure\nthat our assets and\n\n158\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.770\nour configuration items are updated\nwhenever there's been any change made.\n\n159\n00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.830\nWe're looking to insure that we have\nthought about our operations teams and\n\n160\n00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.120\nwe've thought about our operational\nenvironment when we're implementing and\n\n161\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.810\nwhen we're deploying into\nthe live environment.\n\n162\n00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:47.260\nSo we are acting basically as\nan integration into the project team.\n\n163\n00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.740\nAnd also taking control over that DevOps\nenvironment, that environment where we\n\n164\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.830\nhand over from development to\nthe live operating environment.\n\n165\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.310\nThat's what we're looking at.\n\n166\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.770\nSo we're not going to audit your projects,\nthat's not what we're going to do.\n\n167\n00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.280\nHowever, as you can see,\nthere is definitely an overlap.\n\n168\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n169\n00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.380\n&gt;&gt; Because I would expect, you see, and\n\n170\n00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.300\nthis is where you start\ngetting into these gray areas.\n\n171\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.600\nLet's take, for instance,\nservice level management.\n\n172\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.280\nAnd we'll talk about\nthat in our next episode.\n\n173\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.150\nBut let's take service level\nmanagement as an example.\n\n174\n00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.000\nWe can't, or we shouldn't,\n\n175\n00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.310\nbe running a project that doesn't include\ndefining service levels for a new service.\n\n176\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.240\nIf you're a project manager, and you're\ndesigning and developing a new service,\n\n177\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.850\nthen you are going to design all of\nthe aspects of that new service.\n\n178\n00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.770\nAnd I should hope that you should\nconsider the service levels and\n\n179\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.850\nthe service level targets\nin that new service.\n\n180\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.270\nAnd, in fact,\nif we can go back to that new slide for\n\n181\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.950\na moment, then you'll see that here we've\ngot these business requirements coming in.\n\n182\n00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:55.843\nAnd this is where they tell us what the\nrequirements are [CROSSTALK] what their\n\n183\n00:10:55.843 --> 00:10:57.682\nservice level targets are.\n\n184\n00:10:57.682 --> 00:11:01.350\nSo that's happening there,\nand that's been fed into you.\n\n185\n00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.120\nBut you're thinking about\nyour service in isolation.\n\n186\n00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.460\nYou're just thinking about\nthis is what my customer wants\n\n187\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.670\nin terms of service level targets for\nthis new service.\n\n188\n00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.300\nWhat we're thinking about, down here,\ndown at this part of the slide, here,\n\n189\n00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.870\nhere within strategy design transition,\nwithin service management, what we're\n\n190\n00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:30.930\nthinking about is, okay, Cherokee's\nplanning on these service level targets.\n\n191\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.640\nHow is this going to\naffect everything else?\n\n192\n00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n193\n00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.920\n&gt;&gt; What about the rest of our environment?\n\n194\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.240\nYes, we want our customers to have or\nto meet their service level targets.\n\n195\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.362\nBut it's no good you agreeing\na transaction throughput\n\n196\n00:11:47.362 --> 00:11:52.393\nrate 0.0001 millisecond when our\nbandwidth simply can't support that,\n\n197\n00:11:52.393 --> 00:11:54.385\nand you're bringing in-\n&gt;&gt; The project that's happening is\n\n198\n00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:56.670\nutilizing or sucking up that bandwith.\n\n199\n00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.913\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that's where you talked\n\n200\n00:11:57.913 --> 00:12:00.582\nabout previously about those silos and\nhow ineffective that was.\n\n201\n00:12:00.582 --> 00:12:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nthis is what happens with project teams.\n\n202\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.090\nHistorically, project teams\ndo tend to work in silos.\n\n203\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.350\nAnd that's something\nthat we have to try and\n\n204\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.190\neven with the implement of the project\nmanagement office and program management,\n\n205\n00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.970\nit's something that we\nhave to get away from.\n\n206\n00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:19.020\nBecause even Agile,\nas a project management methodology,\n\n207\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.660\ncan still work in silos.\n\n208\n00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.040\nBecause we're considering an individual-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n209\n00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.610\n&gt;&gt; Project.\n\n210\n00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.930\nWe're considering an individual\nimplementation of an individual service.\n\n211\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.930\nAnd so, this is why service management\nstill has that involvement in\n\n212\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.880\nthat design and in transition,\nbecause we have to make sure that\n\n213\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.960\nall of these are incorporated,\nthat they're all thought about.\n\n214\n00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.650\nRemember, we used a word in\na previous episode, holistic.\n\n215\n00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.400\nWe use that word in ITIL, and\nI really, really like that word,\n\n216\n00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.660\ncuz it's considering\nabsolutely everything.\n\n217\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.190\nAnd it's not working in silos.\n\n218\n00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:58.910\nSo, here within ISO 20000, then, what\nwe're going to be auditing against is,\n\n219\n00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:03.430\nwhat we're going to be auditing\nto be make sure that services,\n\n220\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.160\nnew services and changes to services,\nare going to be deliverable, and\n\n221\n00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.930\nthey're going to come in at the agreed\ncost and the agreed quality.\n\n222\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:19.230\nSo what we're auditing against are, well,\nplans for new and changed services.\n\n223\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.370\nWe're going to make sure\nthat they have designs.\n\n224\n00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.450\nWe're going to make sure that they\nhave transition plans as well.\n\n225\n00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.460\nNow we also have control process\non the right-hand side, and\n\n226\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:34.280\nyou'll see that they have influence\non our design and transition.\n\n227\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.960\nWhat we're gonna look\nat specifically in this\n\n228\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.780\nparticular episode is what's\non the left-hand side.\n\n229\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.000\nBut we do have another episode\nthat looks at clause nine.\n\n230\n00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.440\nAnd clause nine includes control processes\nsuch as configuration management and\n\n231\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.240\nchange management and release and\ndeployment management as well.\n\n232\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.220\nSo our general requirements, then.\n\n233\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.100\nSo don't forget,\nwe have part one and part two.\n\n234\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.000\nAnd part one is our Shall,\nthis is what we have to achieve.\n\n235\n00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.250\nOur part two is the Intent,\nwhich is this is what you should do,\n\n236\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.695\nbut you don't have to.\n\n237\n00:14:09.695 --> 00:14:11.470\nBut I'm looking for evidence in part one.\n\n238\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.940\nI'm also looking for evidence in part two.\n\n239\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:19.600\nSo I'm looking for evidence that all new\nservices are going to be documented,\n\n240\n00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.220\nthat whatever processes you have in place,\nand\n\n241\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.020\nI'm not looking at\nthe processes right now.\n\n242\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.640\nI'm just saying,\nwhatever processes you have in place,\n\n243\n00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.940\nyou better have all of\nyour services covered.\n\n244\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:37.710\nThey all have to be following design and\ntransition guidelines, every single one.\n\n245\n00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.880\nSo evidence of this is I want evidence\nto show me that in your catalogue\n\n246\n00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.030\nof services that you have all of your\nservices listed in that catalogue.\n\n247\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.928\nAnd I'm looking for evidence to show\nme that all of your services are going\n\n248\n00:14:52.928 --> 00:14:55.141\nthrough design and transition.\n\n249\n00:14:55.141 --> 00:14:57.340\nSo I might be looking at project evidence,\nfor instance.\n\n250\n00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.580\nI might be looking to see\nwhat the project plans were.\n\n251\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.400\nI'll also be looking to\nsee that all changes have,\n\n252\n00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.630\nany change to the live environment goes\nthrough change management, that it all has\n\n253\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:16.985\nthe relevant request for change logged,\nand that there's a change policy in place.\n\n254\n00:15:16.985 --> 00:15:20.220\nNow, don't forget, I mean, we're\ntalking about change management here.\n\n255\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.990\nThis is just a general requirement.\n\n256\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:26.980\nSo you're going to find this in other pros\nwhen we start to look at all he processes,\n\n257\n00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.960\nyou'll find policies to do\nwith change management.\n\n258\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.610\nSo you'll see that there\nis a lot of overlap here.\n\n259\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:39.250\nAnd that's okay because we've still got\nthose 259 defined mandatory clauses.\n\n260\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.430\nAnd some of these might be mentioned here,\nbut\n\n261\n00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.870\nthey might also be covered somewhere else.\n\n262\n00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:48.402\nSo we want to make sure, and I want to\nsee evidence, that this last bullet point\n\n263\n00:15:48.402 --> 00:15:52.111\nunder the part one, take actions\nto ensure that development and\n\n264\n00:15:52.111 --> 00:15:56.047\ntransition can be performed\neffectively using accepted outputs.\n\n265\n00:15:56.047 --> 00:16:00.491\nI wanna make sure that when you\nare creating a new service,\n\n266\n00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:06.582\nwhen you're developing a new service,\nYou have project management in place.\n\n267\n00:16:06.582 --> 00:16:10.880\nI want to see,\nthat this is not just done at home.\n\n268\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:17.660\nThat this is actually undertaken using\nsome form of project management.\n\n269\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.480\nThat you have defined outputs.\n\n270\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.410\nWe go on, we'll go on with the Shalls.\n\n271\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.650\nI want to see, and again,\nthis should be in your project management.\n\n272\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.540\nI want to see that you've\ngot service requirements.\n\n273\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.852\nI want to see that any changes\nto the way that we work,\n\n274\n00:16:35.852 --> 00:16:39.100\nthat is as a result of this new service.\n\n275\n00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.380\nI want to see that that's been considered.\n\n276\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.390\nI want to see that the life\ncycle of the service, so\n\n277\n00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:49.270\ngo back to that particular slide and\nremember what's in that life cycle.\n\n278\n00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.126\nI want to see that all of\nthat has been controlled.\n\n279\n00:16:53.876 --> 00:16:56.990\nThe project Gantt chart is gonna\nhelp me with that one straight away.\n\n280\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.690\nYeah, so I want to see that.\n\n281\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.710\nI want to see that you've got plans for\n\n282\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.350\nthe removal of any existing\nservice that you've got in there.\n\n283\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.040\nBecause new services might be\nreplacing something else, and so\n\n284\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.050\nthere are a set of inclusions\nin there that I want to see.\n\n285\n00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.260\nI want to see responsibilities.\n\n286\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.380\nI want to see organizational charts.\n\n287\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.390\nI want to see sign off.\n\n288\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.900\nI want to see timescales.\n\n289\n00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.840\nI want to see budgets.\n\n290\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.590\nI want to see training analysis.\n\n291\n00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.590\nI want to see skills, matrices, etc.\n\n292\n00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.030\nI want to see some form\nof risk management.\n\n293\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.930\nI wanna see evidence.\n\n294\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:30.950\n&gt;&gt; Management documentation.\n\n295\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Things like that also?\n\n296\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, every single service.\n\n297\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n298\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.490\nI need to see that for\n\n299\n00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.162\nevery single service including the\ndependencies on other services, including\n\n300\n00:17:41.162 --> 00:17:45.350\nsign off by all of our stakeholders,\neven our customers and our users.\n\n301\n00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.330\nI want to see this.\n\n302\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.790\nI want to see that.\n\n303\n00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.710\nI want to see evidence of testing.\n\n304\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.230\nI want to see testing plans.\n\n305\n00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.130\nI want to see exactly\nwhat has been tested.\n\n306\n00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.450\nI want to see service acceptance criteria\nand sign off of testing, as well.\n\n307\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.490\nI want to-\n&gt;&gt; So Jo,\n\n308\n00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.970\nyou're making me feel good right now,\n\n309\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.334\nbecause I'm always\nharping on documentation.\n\n310\n00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:06.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now, people can actually\n\n311\n00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.692\n&gt;&gt; See that there's a reason for\n\n312\n00:18:08.692 --> 00:18:11.040\nall of this,\nnot only just to keep our systems healthy.\n\n313\n00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.720\nBut hey, if you do get audited, they wanna\nsee everything that we've been talk,\n\n314\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.955\nlike I've been telling you to document.\n\n315\n00:18:15.955 --> 00:18:18.976\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are never going\n\n316\n00:18:18.976 --> 00:18:24.400\nto achieve ISO 20000 certification\nwithout documentation.\n\n317\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.170\nThese just simply are not,\ncuz I am going to ask to see evidence.\n\n318\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:33.860\nYour auditor is going to ask\nto see evidence of everything.\n\n319\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.654\nLook at what's in the Shall, this is not\nan insignificant amount of evidence.\n\n320\n00:18:38.654 --> 00:18:41.196\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so.\n\n321\n00:18:41.196 --> 00:18:43.330\n&gt;&gt; If you think about this and\n\n322\n00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.890\nif we take this back to ITIL terms\n&gt;&gt; If we think about this,\n\n323\n00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.480\nthen we can think about the fact that,\n\n324\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.300\nour service design package in ITIL\nterm should contain a lot of this.\n\n325\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.130\nIf your service design package\ndoesn't contain all of this,\n\n326\n00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.030\nthen that tells me that your service\ndesign package is not complete.\n\n327\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.790\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n328\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.000\n&gt;&gt; It's not complete, so your design\npackage should contained all of this.\n\n329\n00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.580\nAnd of course some of this is over and\nabove, what's in the project plan as well.\n\n330\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.280\nSo a Gantt chart is not going to cut it.\n\n331\n00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.460\nA Gantt chart is not gonna give us\nall the information that we need.\n\n332\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.550\nHowever, all of this\ninformation has to be present.\n\n333\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.410\nThese are all parts of the Shalls,\nso therefore,\n\n334\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.970\nyou can't be missing any one of these.\n\n335\n00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.760\nNone of these can be a nonconformity,\nall of these have got to be a conformity.\n\n336\n00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.828\nAnd that's for\nevery service that you have.\n\n337\n00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:42.920\nSo as I'm saying, ISO 20000 actually\ntakes quite an effort to achieve.\n\n338\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.510\nNow, we're not telling you that you need\nto go back and reinvent the wheel, but\n\n339\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:52.110\nit stands to reason, that an organization\nthat's only been in place for\n\n340\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.830\na couple of years.\n\n341\n00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.020\nIf they wanna go to couple\nof services in place,\n\n342\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.130\nas long as they have done\nthis in a structured way and\n\n343\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.010\nthey've implemented services in\na structured way, the documentation, etc,\n\n344\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.680\nshould be relatively easy for\nthem because they should have that.\n\n345\n00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.080\nThink about the organization that's.\n\n346\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.810\nThe organization that's got\na million people working just for\n\n347\n00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:19.650\nthat organization, and they've got\n500 services in that organization.\n\n348\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:24.990\nSome of which are being in place for\nmaybe eight, nine years and\n\n349\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.320\nthey gotta produce documentation for\nall of their services.\n\n350\n00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.080\nThen that becomes a challenge for them.\n\n351\n00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.170\nAnd so, sometimes, it can be difficult.\n\n352\n00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.470\nWe have to work with organizations.\n\n353\n00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.140\nAnd, sometimes, organizations,\nas part of their improvement.\n\n354\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.620\nThey make sure that when they're\nimplementing new services,\n\n355\n00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.200\nthat all of this\ndocumentation is in place.\n\n356\n00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.363\nSo, at some point in time when\nthey've replaced their services,\n\n357\n00:20:49.363 --> 00:20:53.146\nwhen they've upgraded all of their\nservices, the documentations in place and\n\n358\n00:20:53.146 --> 00:20:55.136\nthen they're ready for accreditation.\n\n359\n00:20:56.223 --> 00:21:00.966\nWe shouldn't try and trivialize the amount\nof information that is required for\n\n360\n00:21:00.966 --> 00:21:02.250\nthe ISO 20000.\n\n361\n00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's what I'm realizing right here.\n\n362\n00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.780\nI'm just listening to everything that\nyou're going through, and I'm like,\n\n363\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.490\nokay, all right.\n\n364\n00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.470\nSo there is some warrant\nbehind my nagging [LAUGH].\n\n365\n00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:14.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and the other thing that we\nshouldn't trivialize is the amount of\n\n366\n00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.390\ntime that's taken to\nactually perform an audit.\n\n367\n00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:19.410\nAnd this is why.\n\n368\n00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.930\nI know that when we first see\nthe recommendation that you've got\n\n369\n00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.280\nsomebody internal that's\ngoing to manage this for you.\n\n370\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.230\nAnd you think you don't need somebody\nfull time to manage this for you.\n\n371\n00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.019\nI've just shown you three slides.\n\n372\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.550\nAnd if we go back over these three slides,\n\n373\n00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.580\nif we take a look,\nthere's testing plans here.\n\n374\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.780\n&gt;&gt; You said there's dependencies as well.\n\n375\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.100\n&gt;&gt; Dependencies, yeah,\nlet's take a look here.\n\n376\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.920\nLook at this.\n\n377\n00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.940\nAuthorities, responsibilities,\ntime scales.\n\n378\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.530\nWe're talking about training needs\nanalysis and skills matrices.\n\n379\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.520\nWe're talking about finances,\nwe're talking about budgets.\n\n380\n00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.930\nLet's go back here.\n\n381\n00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.160\nWe're talking about all\nof our services as well.\n\n382\n00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.110\nJust to do this for one service,\nwill take a project manager three months\n\n383\n00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.439\nto compile all of this for\none new service.\n\n384\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.190\nSo you imagine trying\nto just compile this.\n\n385\n00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.890\nWe're just talking about design and\ntransition, nothing more than that.\n\n386\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.390\nSo just compiling this for\nall of our services.\n\n387\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.640\nHow many months is that going to take?\n\n388\n00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.310\nAnd then, we've got to get on to all\nof the other processes, as well.\n\n389\n00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.040\nWe're only up to close five.\n\n390\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.260\nWe've got to get through to close nine,\nand the other ones are quite chunky too.\n\n391\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.190\nSo, yes.\nThere's always a reason for documentation.\n\n392\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.430\nI love documentation.\n\n393\n00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.270\nI don't love when I have to read through\nto much documentation [LAUGH] but\n\n394\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.740\nI love documentation.\n\n395\n00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.290\nSo showing me, is really important.\n\n396\n00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.010\nVery, very important.\n\n397\n00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.720\nSo at this point in time,\nI think that's probably enough for\n\n398\n00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.390\ncore five-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:52.390\n&gt;&gt; To be perfectly honest.\n\n400\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.190\nIt's probably enough for most people.\n\n401\n00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.960\nSo we will leave this episode right here.\n\n402\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.930\nBut when we come back,\nwe're going to look at clause six,\n\n403\n00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.470\nwhich are our service delivery processes.\n\n404\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.400\nOkay.\n\n405\n00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.670\nWell that sounds like a plan, Jo.\n\n406\n00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:09.260\nFor this show we are gonna go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n407\n00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.948\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n408\n00:23:10.948 --> 00:23:15.710\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n409\n00:23:15.710 -->

00:00:08.365\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:12.067\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:17.944\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your ISO/IEC\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:18.740\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.487\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look at\nclause six, continuing with that theme.\n\n8\n00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:27.007\nBut specifically here within clause six,\n\n9\n00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:30.717\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nservice delivery processes and\n\n10\n00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:34.994\nto explain this topic in detail we\nhave Mrs. Jo Peacock bask in studios.\n\n11\n00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:36.260\nHow is it going today Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.160\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great Cherokee, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well thank you for asking.\n\n14\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.640\nSo we've already got through several\nof our topics that we wanted to cover.\n\n15\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.060\nWe just finished looking at clause five\nspecifically with design and transition.\n\n16\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.130\nSo where will we be headed in this show?\n\n17\n00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in this particular episode,\nwe are looking at clause six and\n\n18\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.170\nclause six on our service\ndelivery processes.\n\n19\n00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.810\nAnd so our service delivery processes,\n\n20\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.980\nas we can actually see on\nthe screen in front of us now.\n\n21\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.210\nOur service delivery processes are the\nprocesses for capacity management and\n\n22\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.480\ncontinuity and availability management,\nservice level manager, service reporting.\n\n23\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.290\n&gt;&gt; So we're really focusing\non that blue stuff in here.\n\n24\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're focusing on the blue stuff,\nyeah, security management and\n\n25\n00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.420\nbudgeting and accounting.\n\n26\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.100\nNow, for those of you that have\ncompleted your ITIL Foundation,\n\n27\n00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.010\nyou will notice a few discrepancies\nhere in that blue section there.\n\n28\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.250\nApart from the fact that some of the\nservice design processes are not around,\n\n29\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.180\nthe ITIL service design processes, you'll\nnotice that, well, hopefully two things.\n\n30\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.080\nWe've got our budgeting and\naccounting but no charging.\n\n31\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.448\nAnd not because charging is\noptional in the organization, so\n\n32\n00:01:49.448 --> 00:01:51.400\nwe can't audit against charging.\n\n33\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.340\nWe also have service reporting\nin there as a process.\n\n34\n00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.810\nThat's considered to be a process,\nbecause reporting has to happen.\n\n35\n00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.220\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n36\n00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.331\nAnd we should have a process, we should\nhave a structured way to actually,\n\n37\n00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:17.225\nwell, report and to take metrics and to\ndisplay our metrics, display our reports.\n\n38\n00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:21.057\nAnd we should have a structured way\nto analyze who our audiences are,\n\n39\n00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:24.426\nwhat method they want to see\ntheir reports in, what medium,\n\n40\n00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:28.280\nrather, they want, how frequently\nthey want to see their reports.\n\n41\n00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.610\nSo how often we review\nthe reports as well.\n\n42\n00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.320\nSo we do actually have a separate process\nfor service reporting that we audit on.\n\n43\n00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.300\nNow as we've already said in all of\nour previous episodes we're here in\n\n44\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.250\nISO 20000 and this is where we're going\nto be looking at what we audit against.\n\n45\n00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.610\nSo please let's not try and\nconfuse this with ITIL.\n\n46\n00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.780\nWe're not teaching you how to\nperform any of these processes.\n\n47\n00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.080\nWe're just teaching you really what the\nrequirements are for an ISO 20000 audit.\n\n48\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.430\nAnd of course,\nwe're gonna go straight into this.\n\n49\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.090\nAnd immediately, straight away,\nwe're taking a look at the part ones,\n\n50\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.310\nwhich are the shalls.\n\n51\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.710\nThis is what you have to do,\nyour mandatory requirements.\n\n52\n00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.330\nAnd then we've got part 2, which\nare our intents, which are your should.\n\n53\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.440\nThis is what you should do.\n\n54\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.500\nSo our part 1, then,\nwhat do we have to have?\n\n55\n00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.020\nWe have to have a catalog of services.\n\n56\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.650\nNow, unlike ITIL where it's\ncalled a service catalog,\n\n57\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.820\nwe actually just call it\na catalog of services.\n\n58\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.395\nIt's a list of services with our customer.\n\n59\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.630\nThat has to include the dependencies\nbetween services and\n\n60\n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.420\nbetween service components as well.\n\n61\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.110\nWe also have to, and\nthis is across all of our services, and\n\n62\n00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.910\nwe'll do this probably\nas part of our process.\n\n63\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.571\nWe have to agree the services with our\ncustomers and we have to produce service\n\n64\n00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.445\nlevel agreements that consider\nthe service requirements, but\n\n65\n00:03:56.445 --> 00:04:00.405\nthey are agreements so\nthey have to be signed with our customers.\n\n66\n00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:05.370\nRemember an SLA is an agreement\nbetween IT and a customer.\n\n67\n00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.620\nWe also have to ensure that\nall of these service delivery\n\n68\n00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.880\nprocesses they actually apply\nto all of our services.\n\n69\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.250\nAnd, we have to make sure that\nany changes are accommodated too.\n\n70\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.049\nSo, let's take a look then at our\nintend and our intent is our should.\n\n71\n00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:31.314\nAnd our should is just really to ensure\nthat any agreed service is provided and\n\n72\n00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:32.500\nthe targets are met.\n\n73\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.270\nThat's what we should be doing.\n\n74\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.810\nSo it's not just a case of\nhaving a service target.\n\n75\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.800\nIt's not just a case of having service\nlevel agreements that are signed.\n\n76\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.910\nWe should really be making sure that\nwe meet all of our service level\n\n77\n00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.330\ntargets as well.\n\n78\n00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.310\nThere's not a requirement to ensure\nthat our service targets are met.\n\n79\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.380\nWhy do you think that is, Cherokee?\n\n80\n00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.730\n&gt;&gt; Because that's gonna be really\ndepending on the different organizations\n\n81\n00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.000\nand what their expectations or\ntheir customers' value would be.\n\n82\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.500\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n83\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.240\n&gt;&gt; No, you're overanalyzing this.\n\n84\n00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Just think\nsimply on this one, okay?\n\n85\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.080\nThe reason why there's not a requirement\nto ensure the service level target's met\n\n86\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.260\nor service targets are met is because we\ndon't always meet our service targets.\n\n87\n00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.020\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n88\n00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.100\n&gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.\n\n89\n00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.970\nWhen we've talked in past in our\nITIL classes about SLAM charts,\n\n90\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.250\nour service level agreement monitoring\ncharts and about producing those reports\n\n91\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.290\nthat actually demonstrate our achievement\nof our service level targets.\n\n92\n00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.890\nWell, we don't always meet all\nof our service level targets.\n\n93\n00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.230\nSometimes they're red.\n\n94\n00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.500\nSometimes they're orange or amber.\n\n95\n00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.850\nBut sometimes they're red and\nso we don't always meet them.\n\n96\n00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.600\nSo we can't make that a requirement.\n\n97\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.190\nThat couldn't be a shall.\n\n98\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.560\nWe're not gonna audit to say you must\nmeet all of your service level targets\n\n99\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.940\nbecause you know what?\n\n100\n00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.550\nWe don't always do that, and\n\n101\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.260\nwe've always got the good intentions to\nmeet all of our service level targets.\n\n102\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.510\n&gt;&gt; That's the goal, right?\n\n103\n00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, but\nit never always happens, does it?\n\n104\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.170\nLet's face it, so that's why that's not a\nrequirement there, so it wasn't to try and\n\n105\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.170\ntrip you up.\n\n106\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.724\nAlthough I do like doing that [LAUGH].\n\n107\n00:06:06.724 --> 00:06:08.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it wasn't to try and trip you up.\n\n108\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.400\nThis was just more of an observation\nreally just to point out that yeah,\n\n109\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.190\nthere's a reason why we don't\ninclude that in the shalls.\n\n110\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.690\nSo let's take a look at an example\nof a catalog of services.\n\n111\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.620\nWe're not calling this a service catalog.\n\n112\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.540\nWe call it an example of services.\n\n113\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.110\nNow what you have in your so don't forget,\n\n114\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.300\nin your shalls,\nlet's go back to this particular slide.\n\n115\n00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.460\nWe have to have a catalog of services.\n\n116\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.310\nThat's in a shall,\nyou have to have a catalog of services.\n\n117\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.180\nAnd this is what should appear\nin a catalog of services and\n\n118\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:48.290\nI'm going to look across the top here at\nthe columns that you have to have and\n\n119\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.680\nit doesn't have to be displayed\nlike this by the way,\n\n120\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.090\nbecause if you've got a database it\ndoesn't have to be displayed like this.\n\n121\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.770\nHowever, you have to have a reference\nnumber for your services.\n\n122\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.090\nAnd your services should have a name and\na description.\n\n123\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.790\nNow go back to your ISO guidance\nif you want guidance on\n\n124\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.610\nwhat a description of\na service should look like.\n\n125\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.540\nGo back to your ITIL Foundation or\nyour ITIL practitioner guidance and\n\n126\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.539\nthat will help you there.\n\n127\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.070\nYou should also have the service hours,\nand you should have a list of targets.\n\n128\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.790\nYou should have who your customer\ncontact is, or your business contact.\n\n129\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.320\n&gt;&gt; And I see there, Jo,\non the service hours,\n\n130\n00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.990\nthere's one with an exception there,\nan exclusion.\n\n131\n00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.080\nSo that's kind of interesting too,\n\n132\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.260\nyou would also want to include that\nif you had any kind of downtime?\n\n133\n00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.125\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're going to get into that\nwhen we look at service level agreements.\n\n134\n00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:38.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because you see,\n\n135\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.850\nwhat you've got here is a reflection of\nthe service level agreements in those\n\n136\n00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:42.565\ntargets.\n\n137\n00:07:42.565 --> 00:07:43.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n138\n00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.570\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're gonna get into them in a moment.\n\n139\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.662\nAnd we have to have the service\nprovider contact, as well.\n\n140\n00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:50.125\nAnd if you look here, and\n\n141\n00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:54.955\nwhat we've got here in this particular\nexample is we've almost got a hierarchy.\n\n142\n00:07:54.955 --> 00:08:03.040\nOf services because we've got sales\ndivision services as an umbrella service.\n\n143\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.780\nBut then all of the others, the European\nsales, the North America sales,\n\n144\n00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.490\npayment processing are a subset,\na sub service.\n\n145\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.940\nAnd so, the service provider\ncontact is the same person for\n\n146\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.980\nevery single one but\nthe business contact isn't.\n\n147\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.490\nNow you'll also notice that all of\nour targets are all exactly the same.\n\n148\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:29.456\nThey all should be,\nas per the target above.\n\n149\n00:08:29.456 --> 00:08:33.770\nNow take a look at the related procedures\nthough cuz I didn't mention this.\n\n150\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n151\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:40.250\nAnd the related procedures are procedures\nfor security in this instance.\n\n152\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.334\nRemember I said we've gotta\nhave the dependencies in here?\n\n153\n00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:45.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd so here we're showing a dependency for\n\n154\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.300\nsecurity and for security requirements.\n\n155\n00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.260\nBut we may be showing dependencies for\nother requirements or for\n\n156\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.460\nother services, as well.\n\n157\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.240\nIt doesn't necessarily\nhave to be security.\n\n158\n00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.670\nBut it'll actually give you a related\nprocedure or related service.\n\n159\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.860\nAnd it gives you the service number,\nthe service name.\n\n160\n00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.530\nAnd there should also be,\nand this is why we say,\n\n161\n00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.580\nthis doesn't have to be a database.\n\n162\n00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:15.210\nBut really it should be,\nbecause you should also then have a link\n\n163\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.640\ninto that particular service.\n\n164\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.342\nSo I should be able to\nclick on that link and\n\n165\n00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:20.050\nthen\n&gt;&gt; So easily,\n\n166\n00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.680\nokay this is what it's attached to,\nI can see how this relationship is bonded,\n\n167\n00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.620\nor whatever.\n\n168\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.550\n&gt;&gt; No, that's another requirement.\n\n169\n00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.260\n&gt;&gt; To them.\n\n170\n00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.806\n&gt;&gt; It's not a requirement,\n\n171\n00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:33.090\nit's not an audit requirement that\nthere is a dynamic link in there, but\n\n172\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.763\nit is an audit requirement that\nthere is a dependency listed.\n\n173\n00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:37.466\n&gt;&gt; Noted, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n174\n00:09:37.466 --> 00:09:41.560\ndependency should be in there but\nit's not a requirement.\n\n175\n00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.110\nIt's not a part one shell but\nit's a dynamic link.\n\n176\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.426\nHowever, I should be able.\n\n177\n00:09:46.426 --> 00:09:50.257\n&gt;&gt; It's like bonus points [LAUGH].\n\n178\n00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:50.900\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n179\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.137\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't work that way, does it?\n\n180\n00:09:52.137 --> 00:09:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Right, even our bonus points.\n\n181\n00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.155\nI don't think so.\nNo, I mean,\n\n182\n00:09:55.155 --> 00:10:00.295\nwe're not gonna give you any kudos for\nhaving it dynamic.\n\n183\n00:10:00.295 --> 00:10:02.147\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; But it certainly makes my life a lot\n\n184\n00:10:02.147 --> 00:10:06.209\neasier, makes the auditor's life a lot\neasier if they don't then have to go\n\n185\n00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:09.572\nthrough, rifling through pieces\nof paper to find that link and\n\n186\n00:10:09.572 --> 00:10:12.140\nto make sure that it's a valid link.\n\n187\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.670\nAnd please, please, please, don't just\nput something in there just cuz you think\n\n188\n00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.390\nthat's what the auditor wants to see.\n\n189\n00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.468\nNo, they're gonna follow the paper trail.\n\n190\n00:10:20.468 --> 00:10:23.798\nAll right, it goes without saying,\nwe're gonna follow,\n\n191\n00:10:23.798 --> 00:10:27.793\nwhen there's a requirement to say\nyou must have a dependency in there,\n\n192\n00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:31.805\nthen you've gotta have\na dependency in there, right?\n\n193\n00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:33.105\nWe're not talking about smoke and\n\n194\n00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:36.475\nmirrors, we're talking about\na real life dependency.\n\n195\n00:10:36.475 --> 00:10:38.365\nAll right, we need to see dependencies.\n\n196\n00:10:38.365 --> 00:10:41.935\nAnd the thing is that you don't know\nwhich dependency the auditor's going to\n\n197\n00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:42.495\npick up on.\n\n198\n00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:45.115\nYou don't know which one they're\ngonna wanna follow the paper trail.\n\n199\n00:10:45.115 --> 00:10:48.825\nOr which ones they're going to want\nto follow the paper trail through.\n\n200\n00:10:48.825 --> 00:10:52.555\nSo yes, it's really important cuz of\ncourse your dependency could go into\n\n201\n00:10:52.555 --> 00:10:56.970\nsecurity but then from security there\ncould be a dependency on something else.\n\n202\n00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.120\nAnd so there could be a dependency on say,\nserver management, for instance.\n\n203\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.446\nAnd so in that condition then we\nwould follow that trial down and\n\n204\n00:11:04.446 --> 00:11:06.153\nwe would continue that, yeah.\n\n205\n00:11:06.153 --> 00:11:06.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n206\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.908\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's not just a case\nof just showing one sort of level,\n\n207\n00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:14.417\nnow we want to see the paper\ntrail go all the way around.\n\n208\n00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:16.940\nWe're gonna follow that.\n\n209\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.520\nSo what about then\nservice level management?\n\n210\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.830\nService level management as a process.\n\n211\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.824\nWhat are we going to be audited on?\n\n212\n00:11:24.824 --> 00:11:26.880\nWell, here we are in part one.\n\n213\n00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.820\nWe're in the shell again.\n\n214\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.530\nSo, you have to have SLAs.\n\n215\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.950\nThey have to include services and\ntargets and workload characteristics.\n\n216\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.600\nAnd as you just mentioned, the exceptions.\n\n217\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.720\nThese are your hours of operation and\nthese are the exceptions.\n\n218\n00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.750\nAnd they also have to include,\nwhen we say workload characteristics,\n\n219\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.660\nthings like this is when we\nmake changes to the service.\n\n220\n00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.590\nSo these were our release windows.\n\n221\n00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.280\nThat needs to be in the SLA.\n\n222\n00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.800\nThis is a Shall,\nthis is not open for discussion.\n\n223\n00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.650\nThis is a Shall, you have to have this.\n\n224\n00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.440\nAnd it's the same with your OLAs,\nyour Operational Level Agreements, and\n\n225\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.900\nyour contracts as well.\n\n226\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.420\nWhether they're with suppliers or\ninternal groups,\n\n227\n00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.375\nthen ensure that we've got\nthe Activities in all the interfaces.\n\n228\n00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:17.565\nThey have to be agreed, they have to\nbe signed between those two parties,\n\n229\n00:12:17.565 --> 00:12:22.285\nthey have to be subject to review\non a regular basis as well.\n\n230\n00:12:22.285 --> 00:12:24.990\nThey have to include the targets etc., so\n\n231\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.930\nhere we have an example of\nwhat that would look like.\n\n232\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.130\nSo that's service catalog,\na catalog of services.\n\n233\n00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.650\nWhat I've done is I've\nexpanded those services.\n\n234\n00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.180\nAnd I've said, here, look at this.\n\n235\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.620\nWe've got our sales support.\n\n236\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:43.220\nWe've got our sales support here and\nour sales, EU sales, and our payment\n\n237\n00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:49.230\nprocess and then our are US sales and\nwe've got our OLAs in place here as well.\n\n238\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.390\nSo this is what- I don't expect\nto see this sort of diagram, but\n\n239\n00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.660\nthis is just an example of\nwhat it could look like.\n\n240\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.880\nLet's look at what could be in an SLA.\n\n241\n00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:06.560\nWhat could be in a Service Level Agreement\nis a description, the validity period.\n\n242\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.660\nRemember I said that I want to see\nevidence that our documentation,\n\n243\n00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:16.600\nin a previous episode I mentioned, I want\nto see evidence that our documentation is\n\n244\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.420\nsomething to review on a regular basis.\n\n245\n00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.950\nI want to see this.\n\n246\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.366\nAnd so, therefore,\n\n247\n00:13:22.366 --> 00:13:26.859\nI want to see in every single document\nthat it's got an expiry time.\n\n248\n00:13:26.859 --> 00:13:29.430\nThat it's got an expiry date.\n\n249\n00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.870\nI want to see that.\n\n250\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.380\nI want to see information on how\nto make a change to the document.\n\n251\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.900\nSo, what change approval really means and\nwhat the change process is.\n\n252\n00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.830\nI wanna see description of\nthe actual service itself.\n\n253\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.227\nI want to see the hours\nincluding those exceptions too.\n\n254\n00:13:45.227 --> 00:13:50.400\nAnd of course, what am I looking at?\n\n255\n00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.720\nThe release windows,\nthat's what I'm talking about.\n\n256\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.180\nNow a service level\nagreement is a document that\n\n257\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.990\ndetails the responsibilities\nof both sides.\n\n258\n00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.658\nSo I need to see both the service\nprovider obligations but\n\n259\n00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:03.500\nalso the customer responsibilities.\n\n260\n00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.388\nI will provide you with\nthe ability to send and\n\n261\n00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:10.810\nreceive email as long as you\ndon't download any viruses.\n\n262\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.550\nOur responsibilities of both sides.\n\n263\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.429\nThey have to be listed in an SLA.\n\n264\n00:14:15.429 --> 00:14:20.133\nI am going to be incredibly wary of\nany service level agreement that\n\n265\n00:14:20.133 --> 00:14:23.920\ndoes not put any responsibility\non to the customers.\n\n266\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.510\n&gt;&gt; At least maybe even if it's\nlike an external customer like\n\n267\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.050\npay your bill kind of thing.\n\n268\n00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, good.\n\n269\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.570\nMost definitely, if it's an external\ncustomer, then there has to be some sort\n\n270\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.679\nof clause in there that says, you've\ngot to pay within however many days.\n\n271\n00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:38.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that.\n\n272\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.710\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise you're just setting\nyourself up for an issue legally.\n\n273\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:43.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n274\n00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean,\n\n275\n00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.050\nin contracts, and this is an example\nof a service level agreement,\n\n276\n00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.140\nbut this applies to contracts and\nit applies to OLAs as well but\n\n277\n00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.110\nin contracts I expect to see penalties and\nincentives in there, too.\n\n278\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.910\nAnd I also expect to see sort of maybe\nfinancial penalties, for instance.\n\n279\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.270\n&gt;&gt; Late fees, yeah.\n\n280\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:09.110\n&gt;&gt; Late fees or maybe even suspension of\ncontracts if there are any issue on paper.\n\n281\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.650\n&gt;&gt; Delinquent past a certain amount of\ndays, 30 days or 90 days, whatever.\n\n282\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sort of thing.\n\n283\n00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.971\nThat's what I'd expect to see.\n\n284\n00:15:14.971 --> 00:15:19.449\nI'd also expect to see escalation\nprocedures and impact and\n\n285\n00:15:19.449 --> 00:15:21.130\nurgency guidelines.\n\n286\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.485\nI want to see all of this.\n\n287\n00:15:22.485 --> 00:15:26.035\nI wanna see any costs that\nwe've already talked about.\n\n288\n00:15:26.035 --> 00:15:28.235\nAnd maybe a glossary of terms and\n\n289\n00:15:28.235 --> 00:15:31.155\nconditions, definitions because-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] To help\n\n290\n00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:33.350\nJo decipher everything\nthat's in this document.\n\n291\n00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.905\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah, yeah.\n\n292\n00:15:34.905 --> 00:15:37.575\nYeah, I wanna see what you mean by this.\n\n293\n00:15:38.635 --> 00:15:43.623\nI would be, again, I'm very,\nvery wary of Service level Agreements that\n\n294\n00:15:43.623 --> 00:15:47.353\nactually contain words that\nI understand everything.\n\n295\n00:15:47.353 --> 00:15:51.019\nBecause if I understand everything then\nthat means that's a generic service level\n\n296\n00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:53.803\nagreement and this is not very\nspecific to your organization.\n\n297\n00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:54.466\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense.\n\n298\n00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:58.598\n&gt;&gt; I would expect to see an SLA that Well\nthey've got to be clear, concise and\n\n299\n00:15:58.598 --> 00:15:59.475\nunambiguous.\n\n300\n00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:02.628\nIt's got to be in the language\nthat the customer understands, but\n\n301\n00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:05.499\nthere should be some sort of\nproprietary language in there,\n\n302\n00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:07.770\nsomething that is unique\nto the organization.\n\n303\n00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.250\n&gt;&gt; Like an edu-tainer?\n\n304\n00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:09.820\n&gt;&gt; Right!\n\n305\n00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.520\nYeah.\nExactly.\n\n306\n00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.290\n&gt;&gt; What is an edu-tainer?\n\n307\n00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.160\n&gt;&gt; What is an edu-tainer?\n\n308\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.355\nCherokee's an edu-tainer.\n\n309\n00:16:15.355 --> 00:16:20.450\n[LAUGH] She's supposed to educate and\nentertain all at the same time.\n\n310\n00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.120\n&gt;&gt; Hey, if they're laughing at me for\nsome reason or\n\n311\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.610\nanother, I'm okay with it\nas long as you're learning.\n\n312\n00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.780\nThat's the key here.\n\n313\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, yeah,\n\n314\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.725\nyou're supposed to be learning,\nnot just laughing at us.\n\n315\n00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:33.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's pretty good, that goes on.\n\n316\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.546\nI just know that's-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:16:35.546 --> 00:16:37.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so\n\n318\n00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.040\nwhat else should then we be doing\nin service level management?\n\n319\n00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.440\nI have already said to you,\nthat in terms of service level management,\n\n320\n00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.080\nI expect to see a monitoring process here.\n\n321\n00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.550\nI expect to see that we\nare reviewing our service level\n\n322\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.430\ndocuments on a regular basis\nbecause they are documents.\n\n323\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.840\nBut I also expect to see that we're\nreviewing performance against service\n\n324\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.290\nlevel targets so that we are conducting\nwhat we call service review meetings and\n\n325\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:09.030\nthat we are sitting down with the customer\nand discussing performance against those\n\n326\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:15.600\nservice level targets and that we are able\nto identify opportunities for improvement.\n\n327\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.489\nNow, in that last bullet point there,\nit talks about reviewing results and\n\n328\n00:17:19.489 --> 00:17:21.203\nidentifying nonconformaties.\n\n329\n00:17:21.203 --> 00:17:26.190\nThat doesn't just refer\nto the audit itself.\n\n330\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.460\nYou know, review what we've got so far and\nidentify any nonconformities, but also\n\n331\n00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.810\nrefers to our performance against those\nservice level targets on a regular basis.\n\n332\n00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:39.780\nWe should be producing service level\nagreement monitoring charts for instance,\n\n333\n00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.860\nas we've identified in ITIL.\n\n334\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.440\nWe should be producing RAG charts.\n\n335\n00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.290\nAs an auditor I want to see that.\n\n336\n00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.510\nThis is part of your shall.\n\n337\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.889\nI want to see that your\nservices are reviewed.\n\n338\n00:17:49.889 --> 00:17:53.776\nI want to see that you\nare performing review meetings and\n\n339\n00:17:53.776 --> 00:17:58.750\nthat you identify improvement\nopportunities within those services.\n\n340\n00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.450\nThis is part of the audit.\n\n341\n00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:08.860\nThe audit is to demonstrate that you are\nable to deliver value to your customers.\n\n342\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.310\nThat's what the audit does,\nit demonstrates this.\n\n343\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:17.178\nThat brings us quite nicely into\nreporting to be perfectly honest because\n\n344\n00:18:17.178 --> 00:18:22.590\nreporting as a process, reporting is\nsomething that we would audit against.\n\n345\n00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:27.991\nSo we need to make sure that we\nare able to produce reports,\n\n346\n00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:31.690\nthat you're able to describe each report,\nthat it's got a definition to it,\n\n347\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.690\nthat it's got a description that\nsomebody like me can understand.\n\n348\n00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.790\nAnd that the information\nin that report is used.\n\n349\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:45.610\nRemember in form management decisions and\nmaking decisions based on reporting.\n\n350\n00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.973\nIn ITIL, an ITIL is just a guidance,an\nITIL may help you achieve ISO 20000 but\n\n351\n00:18:52.973 --> 00:18:56.999\nin ITIL there was a process\ncalled knowledge management.\n\n352\n00:18:56.999 --> 00:19:01.340\nAnd knowledge management really explored\nthe theory that you shouldn't be\n\n353\n00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.392\nproducing any report and\nyou shouldn't be producing\n\n354\n00:19:04.392 --> 00:19:08.210\nany information if you can't make\nan informed decision out of it.\n\n355\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.880\nAnd so, this is what I'm\nauditing at this point in time,\n\n356\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.380\nis I'm looking to see that you can make\ndecisions based on the reports and\n\n357\n00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.880\nthat you're not just producing reports\n&gt;&gt; For the sake of producing your report.\n\n358\n00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.090\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwe do this at IT We do this a lot\n\n359\n00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.700\nwhere we just produce nice pretty pictures\njust for the sake of nice pretty pictures.\n\n360\n00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.110\nAnd so\nwe need to see intent on these reports.\n\n361\n00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.840\nSo when I say show me I\nwill be asking questions.\n\n362\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.290\nWhy do you use this?\n\n363\n00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.920\nI want to see under reports.\n\n364\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.960\nI want to see lists of\nrecommendations under reports.\n\n365\n00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.530\nI want to see an action plan or\n\n366\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.930\nan improvement opportunity\nlisted under a report.\n\n367\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.370\nLook at the intent.\n\n368\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:51.400\nPart 2 intent here, ensure that we\nare producing these on a regular\n\n369\n00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.255\nbasis that they're accurate and that they\nfacilitate informed decision making,\n\n370\n00:19:56.255 --> 00:19:59.170\nthat they facilitate communication.\n\n371\n00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:05.130\nIt's really really difficult to\ndemonstrate informed decision making and\n\n372\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.360\nit's very difficult for me to say,\nshow me where a decision was made.\n\n373\n00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.730\nBut now I've said that,\nshould it really be that difficult?\n\n374\n00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.070\nBecause if I can see a report\nwhere something is showing red or\n\n375\n00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.620\nmaybe a trend is going down.\n\n376\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.790\nIf I can see a report where\na trend is going down and\n\n377\n00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.820\nthen I can see, that the recommendation\nsays implement is improvement.\n\n378\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.430\nAnd then I see that you've\nimplemented that improvement,\n\n379\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.800\nthen you're showing me\nthe evidence anyway.\n\n380\n00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.400\nSo was that is an intent, It's a should.\n\n381\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:44.030\nNevertheless, it shouldn't be that\ndifficult to actually achieve.\n\n382\n00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.320\nLet's take a look at just\na reporting index here.\n\n383\n00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.460\nThis is what we should maybe have on\na regular basis just the reports.\n\n384\n00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.050\nWhat the type of report is, who our\naudience is, remember, all communication\n\n385\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.960\nshould be in the language of the audience\nand how often we produce that report.\n\n386\n00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.280\nThat's what I'm looking to see,\n\n387\n00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.367\nI'm looking to see that we have\na reporting index as it were.\n\n388\n00:21:12.085 --> 00:21:15.310\nSo here we have a content of reports.\n\n389\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.750\nIn other words,\nwhat should be in the reports.\n\n390\n00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.700\nThese are, shalls,\nwhat should be in these reports.\n\n391\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:27.070\nWe should be showing performance\nagainst service targets, okay.\n\n392\n00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.360\nWe might call these a SLAM or a RAG chart.\n\n393\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.040\nWe should show reporting against events.\n\n394\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.320\nWe should show work load reporting.\n\n395\n00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.940\nWe should show nonconformities as well and\ntrend information and\n\n396\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.380\ncustomer satisfaction, too.\n\n397\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:48.470\nAll of these are shalls and all of these\nare requirements in terms of reporting.\n\n398\n00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.830\nSo all of these are going to be audited.\n\n399\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.790\nEvery single one of these and including,\n\n400\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:58.120\nobviously, the generic ones that we looked\nat at the beginning of reporting and\n\n401\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.560\nthose that we looked at at the beginning\nof service level management.\n\n402\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.930\nSo now what we're going to do is\nwe're going to take a break for\n\n403\n00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.580\nthis particular section.\n\n404\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.100\nAnd when we come back we'll\nbe looking at part two for\n\n405\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.420\nour service delivery processes.\n\n406\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.830\nAnd what we audit against in things\nlike availability management and\n\n407\n00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.930\ncontinuity management, for instance.\n\n408\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:18.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n409\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.510\nYou heard it first,\nstay tuned for part two.\n\n410\n00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.860\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n411\n00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.440\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n412\n00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.260\n&gt;&gt; And

00:00:08.396\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:10.953\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.953 --> 00:00:18.110\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to ISO/IEC 20000 2011,\nFoundation Series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.076\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.076 --> 00:00:25.000\nIn this episode, we'll continue with the\nPart 2, where we're looking at Clause 6.\n\n8\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.640\nSpecifically, we'll be looking\nat Service Delivery Processes.\n\n9\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.690\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mrs.\n\n10\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.930\nJo Peacock, thanks for joining us, Jo.\n\n11\n00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.677\n&gt;&gt; Thanks very much for\nhaving me Cherokee, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:34.677 --> 00:00:36.763\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know it's always like this formality\n\n13\n00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:37.440\nhere always.\n\n14\n00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.336\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n[LAUGH] How are you?\n\n15\n00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:40.265\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n16\n00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.822\nreally we're just trying to segway into\nthe really great content that we have and\n\n17\n00:00:43.822 --> 00:00:46.090\nwe're gonna be to looking\nhere again at Clause 6.\n\n18\n00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.340\n&gt;&gt; No I'm just trying to prove that\nsome British people can be polite,\n\n19\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.875\nbut it's not often that I can do that,\nthat's all I'm doing.\n\n20\n00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.005\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n21\n00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.387\nyour pseudo-politeness here.\n\n22\n00:00:56.387 --> 00:00:58.357\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah, we are,\n\n23\n00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:01.402\nwe're going to continue where we\nleft off in our previous episode.\n\n24\n00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:05.505\nWe're going to be looking at Clause 6,\nour Service Delivery Processes and\n\n25\n00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:08.400\nwhat we ordered and\nour service delivery processes.\n\n26\n00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.028\nAnd in our last episode we looked\nat service level management and\n\n27\n00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:13.921\nwe looked at service reporting.\n\n28\n00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.014\nAnd in this particular episode,\n\n29\n00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:21.770\nwe are going to start off by looking at\navailability and continuity management.\n\n30\n00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.814\nAnd what we're going to work there and\nthen we'll move in to other processes.\n\n31\n00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:30.576\nSo, let's just take a look at then\nat some definitions that apply to\n\n32\n00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:32.510\nthis particular process.\n\n33\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.890\nOne thing that I will tell you is that\nthe definitions that you will see, and\n\n34\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.760\nyou'll see Part 1 key terms, and\nwe've put them into the presentation for\n\n35\n00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.470\nthe sake of the episodes\nat pertinent points.\n\n36\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.820\nThe relevant points that we're\ngoing to be discussing these.\n\n37\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.825\nBut actually, you will have a separate\nsection in your downloadable material,\n\n38\n00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:56.299\nthat will actually contain\nall of the Part 1 key terms.\n\n39\n00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.156\nSo, they will be grouped together you\nwon't see them together in the slide deck\n\n40\n00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:02.070\nas it were.\n\n41\n00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.740\nYou won't see them the way they are right\nnow in the slide deck, I should say.\n\n42\n00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.820\nSo let's take a look at availability.\n\n43\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.310\nAnd, for those of you that, and we know\nthat it's a prerequisite to ISO 20000,\n\n44\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.590\nwe recommend that you either have\ncompleted ITIL Foundation or\n\n45\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.664\nthat you have a number of\nyears in service management.\n\n46\n00:02:19.664 --> 00:02:22.510\nWell, as we learnt in ITIL Foundation,\n\n47\n00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.100\navailability is the availability\nof a service or a component,\n\n48\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.220\nwe call that a CI in ITIL, to performance\nagreed function when required to do so.\n\n49\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.097\nAnd service continuity well,\nthat's about a capability.\n\n50\n00:02:36.097 --> 00:02:38.358\nA capability to manage risks and\n\n51\n00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:43.810\nevents that can have a serious\ndetrimental impact on services.\n\n52\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.710\nService continuity is about continuing\nservices not just about disaster recovery,\n\n53\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.190\nwhich is about picking up the pieces\nafter something's gone wrong.\n\n54\n00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.560\nContinuity is about continuing service.\n\n55\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.188\nAnd of course a risk is the effect\nof uncertainty on objectives.\n\n56\n00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:03.097\nSo it's a deviation from the expected and\n\n57\n00:03:03.097 --> 00:03:06.720\nit could have various\ndifferent aspects to it.\n\n58\n00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.200\nBut it's often expressed as\na combination of the consequences and\n\n59\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.772\nthe likelihood as well.\n\n60\n00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:16.820\nNow again, just like everything else,\nany other aspect of ISO\n\n61\n00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.583\n20000, we're not going to\ntell you what methodology\n\n62\n00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:26.263\nthat you will use to mange risk and\nhelp you identify risk.\n\n63\n00:03:26.263 --> 00:03:28.435\nWe'll tell you that you need to do this.\n\n64\n00:03:28.435 --> 00:03:33.483\nThat you need to have some form of\nrisk management methodology in place.\n\n65\n00:03:33.483 --> 00:03:37.882\nOr rather not so much need to, but\nit's probably in your own best interest to\n\n66\n00:03:37.882 --> 00:03:42.285\ndo this because you've got to demonstrate\nthat you are performing some form\n\n67\n00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:45.407\nof risk management and\nsome form of risk mitigation.\n\n68\n00:03:45.407 --> 00:03:49.519\nSo, if you want to have\na risk methodology in place,\n\n69\n00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:56.160\nsomething like management of risk, MOR for\ninstance, then by all means then do so.\n\n70\n00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.210\nIt certainly will help you,\nI'm not gonna tell you that it's gonna\n\n71\n00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.420\nbe a guaranteed pass if you've\ngot MOR in place not at all.\n\n72\n00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.360\nIt's just exactly the same as we're not\ngonna tell you you've got a guarantee\n\n73\n00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.115\npass if you got an ISO\nbased frame work in place.\n\n74\n00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:13.430\nCuz we can't do that ITIL\nis just a frame work.\n\n75\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.660\nIt's something that you adapt, and\nit's something that you implement,\n\n76\n00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.910\nan ITIL base frame work, but ISO 20000\nis something you would would achieve.\n\n77\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.602\nIt is a qualification a certification\nthat will let you whether\n\n78\n00:04:26.602 --> 00:04:31.382\nyour ITIL based framework is\nindeed efficient and effective and\n\n79\n00:04:31.382 --> 00:04:35.738\nthat it does actually meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n80\n00:04:35.738 --> 00:04:39.060\nSo let's take a look at continuity and\navailability management and\n\n81\n00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.867\nlet's take a look at the Part\n1 which are the must haves.\n\n82\n00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:44.124\nThese are your mandatory requirements, so\n\n83\n00:04:44.124 --> 00:04:47.120\nthis is what we're going\nto be auditing against.\n\n84\n00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.073\nWe're going to be auditing against your\nability to assess and to document risks,\n\n85\n00:04:52.073 --> 00:04:55.386\non continuity and\non the availability of the service.\n\n86\n00:04:55.386 --> 00:05:00.062\nWe're going to be auditing against your\nrequirements based on your business plans\n\n87\n00:05:00.062 --> 00:05:02.944\nand your service requirements,\nyour SLAs, etc.\n\n88\n00:05:02.944 --> 00:05:07.565\nWe're going to audit that you have in\nplace a service continuity plan and\n\n89\n00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:11.420\nan availability plan,\nby the way they could be combined.\n\n90\n00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.670\nThere's nothing wrong with that, and\n\n91\n00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.870\nwe're going to audit that you\ndo have some form of assessment\n\n92\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.430\non the impact of RFC's, requests for\nchange on our continuity plan.\n\n93\n00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.520\nSo yes we're bringing in a little\nbit of change management in here.\n\n94\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.870\nBut we have to audit to ensure that\nyou're performing risk assessment.\n\n95\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.160\nIf you're not performing risk assessment,\n\n96\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.360\nthen there is no way that you\nare delivering value to your organization.\n\n97\n00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.600\nBecause if everything catches you unaware,\nif everything catches you by surprise,\n\n98\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.610\nI didn't expect it to do that.\n\n99\n00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.610\nThen that's a lack of planning, that's\ncalled bad preparation, and maybe even\n\n100\n00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.800\nbad project management in which case then\nyou're certainly not delivering value.\n\n101\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.819\nNow again in this Part 2\nthe intent which are the should,\n\n102\n00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.373\nit says here that we should be\nensuring that continuity and\n\n103\n00:06:05.373 --> 00:06:10.473\navailability commitments can be met within\nthe targets that are agreed in the SLA.\n\n104\n00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:12.651\nIn our previous section,\n\n105\n00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:18.600\nin our previous episode I mentioned\nthat this can't appear as a shall.\n\n106\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.528\nIt can not appear as a mask,\ncuz we don't always meet our targets.\n\n107\n00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:26.911\nYeah, we should meet our targets, and\nI'd love to put it into the shalls,\n\n108\n00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:29.520\ninto the you must meet your targets.\n\n109\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.296\nBut never the less,\nwe don't always meet our target so\n\n110\n00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:35.605\nthis will only ever be an intent.\n\n111\n00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:40.651\nBut I want to see evidence that\ntargets are being monitored and that,\n\n112\n00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:45.528\nwhere we don't meet targets,\nthat targets are being acted upon.\n\n113\n00:06:45.528 --> 00:06:51.331\nSo, a service continuity management\nprocess might look something like this and\n\n114\n00:06:51.331 --> 00:06:52.876\nthis is just a might.\n\n115\n00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:56.770\nAnd we might initiate service\ncontinuity management.\n\n116\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.878\nIn other words, we decide that we\nneed service continuity management.\n\n117\n00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:04.289\nThen we define the requirements,\nincluding risk assessment and\n\n118\n00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:08.990\nbusiness impact and the strategy,\nthen we implement this.\n\n119\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.410\nAnd we'll do this hand in hand\nwith the organization by the way.\n\n120\n00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.900\nAnd if you need further\nguidance on how to implement\n\n121\n00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.170\na service continuity management process,\nthen again I will refer you to ITIL.\n\n122\n00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.000\nAnd ITIL will give you\nguidance on how to implement\n\n123\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.229\nsomething that will meet\nyour organization's needs.\n\n124\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.521\nYou also need to and\n\n125\n00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:32.011\nwe want to see evidence of all of\nthis don't forget the show me.\n\n126\n00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:36.305\nI want to see evidence that you have\noperational management that your\n\n127\n00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:39.210\ninvocation criteria are very clear.\n\n128\n00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.847\nAnd that you are performing regular\ntests and that you're performing\n\n129\n00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:48.797\nregular reviews to ensure that continuity\nmanagement is kept up to date and\n\n130\n00:07:48.797 --> 00:07:52.506\nit's still relevant to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n131\n00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:57.196\nAnd that whenever there is a new major\nchange implemented not only do we test\n\n132\n00:07:57.196 --> 00:08:02.195\ncontinuity, but we ensure that it is\nincorporated into out continuity plans.\n\n133\n00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:05.000\nSo that's incredibly important.\n\n134\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.170\nSo think about, then, in each of these\nsteps, how we plan for continuity.\n\n135\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:17.210\nHow we then implement continuity,\nhow we monitor continuity, and\n\n136\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.230\nhow we're going to provide evidence\nthat we're doing all of these.\n\n137\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:26.470\nBecause, again, in my continuity and\nin availability management in my planning,\n\n138\n00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.940\nmy plan should include procedures for\nwhat to do when something goes wrong,\n\n139\n00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.870\nmy availability targets, my recovery\nrequirements, recovery mechanisms, and\n\n140\n00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.170\nalso how I'm gonna get back\nto normal working conditions.\n\n141\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:43.280\nWe forget that sometimes\nin service continuity.\n\n142\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.530\nWe're too busy thinking about how we're\ngoing to get over to the disaster recovery\n\n143\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.090\nside, and we forget that we've\nstill got to come back, as well.\n\n144\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.210\n&gt;&gt; So, Jo, it sounds like your DRP,\nor disaster recovery plan, and\n\n145\n00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:59.220\nyour business continuity plan, your BCP,\nthose would be extremely essential and\n\n146\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.450\nhelpful documents to help\nto provide that show here.\n\n147\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.560\n&gt;&gt; We're not interested in\nthe disaster recovery plan,\n\n148\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.370\nbecause we're not concerned\nabout disaster recovery.\n\n149\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we wanna prevent it,\n\n150\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.770\nin the first place.\n\n151\n00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:18.330\nSo actually, your disaster recovery plan,\nin terms of ISO 20000, it doesn't exist.\n\n152\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n153\n00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.580\n&gt;&gt; Because we call it a continuity plan.\n\n154\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we should be proactive rather than\n\n155\n00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.870\nreactive.\n\n156\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.680\nSo, yes,\n\n157\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:32.010\nyour service continuity plan will actually\nincorporate what you would call your DRP.\n\n158\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n159\n00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.060\n&gt;&gt; But we are not gonna call it that,\nbecause as far as we're concerned,\n\n160\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.660\nwe should be proactive\nrather than being reactive.\n\n161\n00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.560\nAnd we shouldn't be looking just to pick\nup the pieces when something goes wrong,\n\n162\n00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.970\nwe should be looking to maintain\ncontinuity to stop it going wrong.\n\n163\n00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.370\nSo we're looking at resilience options,\netc.\n\n164\n00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.800\nSo we're kind of getting in there first,\nwhich is why we perform risk management,\n\n165\n00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.980\nbecause we want to prevent\nsomething from failing rather than\n\n166\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.582\npick up the pieces when it has failed.\n\n167\n00:09:57.582 --> 00:09:58.222\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n168\n00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:00.390\n&gt;&gt; Business continuity.\n\n169\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.980\nNow I'd refer everybody back to ITIL for\nguidance on how to implement\n\n170\n00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.550\nservice continuity and and\nhow to incorporate business continuity.\n\n171\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.810\nBut there are some very,\nvery good diagrams within the ITIL shows.\n\n172\n00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.520\nCertainly when we look at service design,\nfor instance,\n\n173\n00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.660\nand there is a whole episode on service\ncontinuity in the service design show.\n\n174\n00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.750\nBut also when you look at\nthe foundation as well,\n\n175\n00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.450\nin that we have to incorporate\nbusiness continuity.\n\n176\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.930\nIt's all about delivering\nvalue to the organization.\n\n177\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.270\nAnd the organization will\ntell us what they value and\n\n178\n00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.360\nwhat they want to be recovered first.\n\n179\n00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.363\nSo we have to make sure that\nwe're in line with them.\n\n180\n00:10:42.363 --> 00:10:44.313\nSo I want to see, in my plans,\n\n181\n00:10:44.313 --> 00:10:49.630\nI want to see that there is evidence of\nus bringing in business continuity plan.\n\n182\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:55.490\nI want to see evidence of us bringing\nin the requirements for the business.\n\n183\n00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.870\nAnd it's interesting to me, and I'm just\ngonna say this cuz I'm mean like this,\n\n184\n00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:03.330\nbut it's interesting to me that you\nmentioned the business continuity plan.\n\n185\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.420\nSo the business is expected to have\ncontinuity, but we're expected to pick up\n\n186\n00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.340\nthe pieces when it goes wrong, cuz you\nmentioned a disaster recovery plan.\n\n187\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWell, I mean, it just depends.\n\n188\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.260\nYeah, I mean, I've heard different\ncompanies use those terms,\n\n189\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.450\nsometimes even interchangeably, although\nthey are two different Ideas there.\n\n190\n00:11:20.715 --> 00:11:25.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we try and, I wouldn't say\nwe're trying to steer people away, but\n\n191\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.100\nwe want to obviously\npromote the fact that being\n\n192\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.580\nproactive is a much better position\nto be in than being reactive.\n\n193\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n194\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Worrying about how you're going to pick\nup the pieces when something goes wrong.\n\n195\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.550\nDoesn't it make more sense to stop\nit going wrong in the first place?\n\n196\n00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.518\n&gt;&gt; It does, so maybe that term\nis kind of gonna be fading out.\n\n197\n00:11:41.518 --> 00:11:44.320\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Well, think about when you're driving.\n\n198\n00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.298\nOkay, when you're on the road and\nyou're driving, are you,\n\n199\n00:11:48.298 --> 00:11:52.963\ndo you already have your workshop\nselected for when you have an accident?\n\n200\n00:11:52.963 --> 00:11:57.700\nOr do you actually try and\nnot have an accident, for instance?\n\n201\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.091\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n202\n00:11:59.091 --> 00:12:03.150\ndo you make sure that you've got roadside\nrecovery and you've got somebody to tow\n\n203\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.910\nyou away and you've got a workshop all\nprepared for when you have an accident?\n\n204\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.027\nOr do you actually just try and\n\n205\n00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:10.181\nprevent the accident from\nhappening in the first place?\n\n206\n00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:14.691\nI mean, you're probably gonna\ndrive in a way that prevents you\n\n207\n00:12:14.691 --> 00:12:17.440\nfrom having an accident, right.\n\n208\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n209\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.695\n&gt;&gt; It's the same sort of premise.\n\n210\n00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:20.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n211\n00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.500\n&gt;&gt; It really should be.\n\n212\n00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.480\nAre we planning for something to go wrong,\n\n213\n00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.675\nor do we just wanna avoid\nit in the first place?\n\n214\n00:12:25.675 --> 00:12:28.885\nAnd we kind of think it makes\nmore sense to avoid it.\n\n215\n00:12:28.885 --> 00:12:29.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n216\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.769\n&gt;&gt; But just in case something goes wrong,\nthen we might pay for\n\n217\n00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:35.810\nroadside recovery anyway.\n\n218\n00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.188\nIt's an insurance policy, right?\n\n219\n00:12:37.188 --> 00:12:41.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's laughing, she's not convinced.\n\n220\n00:12:41.659 --> 00:12:44.287\n&gt;&gt; I'm just really, I guess I'm probably\n\n221\n00:12:44.287 --> 00:12:49.440\nmore towards the paranoid end of that\nspectrum on things, though, yeah.\n\n222\n00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.444\n&gt;&gt; So she's expecting things to go wrong,\nthen.\n\n223\n00:12:51.444 --> 00:12:52.400\nOkay, fair enough.\n\n224\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.209\n&gt;&gt; Pessimists, yeah.\n\n225\n00:12:54.209 --> 00:12:57.060\n&gt;&gt; You know what, whatever you\nhave when it comes to an audit,\n\n226\n00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.960\nI want to see evidence, so just show me,\njust show me what you got and\n\n227\n00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.240\nI'll tell you whether its inadequate or\nnot.\n\n228\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.850\nBut it's not just enough\nto have insurance,\n\n229\n00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.730\nit's also you need to have\na driving license, too.\n\n230\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n231\n00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.409\nSo you need to be able\n\n232\n00:13:10.409 --> 00:13:14.111\nto demonstrate that you can drive in a way\nthat doesn't cause accidents, right?\n\n233\n00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:15.489\nAs well as having insurance for\n\n234\n00:13:15.489 --> 00:13:17.370\nwhen an accident does happen.\n\n235\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.400\nYeah, and this is exactly the same thing.\n\n236\n00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.600\nThis isn't just about having\nthat driver's license,\n\n237\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.195\nmaking sure that we know how to drive.\n\n238\n00:13:24.195 --> 00:13:27.600\n[LAUGH] So\nas we've already said that what we've\n\n239\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.530\ngot to demonstrate is that we've\ngot that drivers license, right?\n\n240\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.260\nThat we know how to drive.\n\n241\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:38.190\nWe've got to demonstrate that we've got\nplans, and those plans include our plans\n\n242\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:43.730\nfor our new services, but also ongoing\nplans for existing services as well.\n\n243\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.240\nThese are availability plans and\ncontinuity plans.\n\n244\n00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.860\nSo I want to see that my\nplans are tested regularly,\n\n245\n00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.890\nthat are monitored and that we check for\nrelevance in our plans.\n\n246\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.380\nBut that they are also\ntested on a regular basis.\n\n247\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:04.000\nAnd that's something else that is\ngoing to cause a huge big problem for\n\n248\n00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.940\na lot of organizations.\n\n249\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.920\nIt really is.\n\n250\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.390\nCuz when we talk about a continuity plan,\nand we talk about a continuity plan being\n\n251\n00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:15.400\ntested, I don't just mean that\nwe've walked through the plan.\n\n252\n00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.490\n&gt;&gt; That sounds expensive for\n\n253\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.340\na lot of organizations that might\nnot be able to afford that.\n\n254\n00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.960\nSimulations may be in place if we can't,\n\n255\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.470\neven even then it can get-\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's not gonna be good enough.\n\n256\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.700\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n257\n00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.026\n&gt;&gt; No.\nI'm not talking about simulations,\n\n258\n00:14:31.026 --> 00:14:35.070\nI'm talking about service\ncontinuity being tested.\n\n259\n00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.300\nThis is why it is a challenge for\n\n260\n00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.810\norganizations to achieve ISO 20000 because\nwhen you think about what it is that\n\n261\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.190\nthey've got to demonstrate, I mean,\nI think of so many organizations.\n\n262\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:53.230\nI know of an airline that was grounded for\n24 hours, a huge global airline as well,\n\n263\n00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:58.580\nthat was grounded for 24 hours because\nthe testing of their continuity.\n\n264\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.670\nWell, let's just say it\nwasn't quite adequate enough.\n\n265\n00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:07.530\nAnd when they had a failure in their\nlive production environment, when their\n\n266\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:12.580\ndisaster recovery environment was\nactually being worked on at the time and\n\n267\n00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.450\nbeing upgraded, then that actually\ntook a major international\n\n268\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.740\nairline down for a number of hours.\n\n269\n00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.600\nWe were at 24 hours I think it was.\n\n270\n00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.920\nAnd then, of course, by that time they\nhad planes in the wrong countries around\n\n271\n00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.310\nthe world, and luggage in the wrong\ncountries around the world.\n\n272\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.680\n&gt;&gt; Those hiccups have the ripple effect.\n\n273\n00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.240\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n274\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.120\nAnd so they learned their lesson\nabout service continuity.\n\n275\n00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.090\nAnd this is why we'll tell\nyou it's gonna be part,\n\n276\n00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:43.640\nthat auditing service continuity\nhas gotta be part of ISO 20000.\n\n277\n00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.040\nIt's gotta be part of an audit.\n\n278\n00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.680\nWe wanna make sure that you have\nservice continuity in place, and\n\n279\n00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.338\nthat you do actually\ntest service continuity.\n\n280\n00:15:51.338 --> 00:15:56.260\nAnd there are a lot of organization\nthat do this on a regular basis.\n\n281\n00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.775\nMost organizations now,\nespecially global organizations,\n\n282\n00:15:59.775 --> 00:16:02.103\nhave got some from of mirroring in place.\n\n283\n00:16:02.103 --> 00:16:04.465\nAnd most organizations\nwill understand the risks.\n\n284\n00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:08.624\nIf they take one site down,\nthen that leaves them exposed for\n\n285\n00:16:08.624 --> 00:16:10.430\nthat period in time.\n\n286\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.940\nNow, it was just an unfortunate\ncircumstance that they happened\n\n287\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.520\nto lose their production environment\nat in that point in time.\n\n288\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.844\nHad they not lost that, or\nhad that DR site, as it were,\n\n289\n00:16:19.844 --> 00:16:23.700\nthat mirrored environment been available.\n\n290\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.870\nThen customers and staff, alike,\nno one would have known the difference.\n\n291\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.560\nBut unfortunately it wasn't, and there are\nsituations like that where you say well,\n\n292\n00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.250\nit doesn't matter how much testing you do.\n\n293\n00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.450\nYou cannot cope with both sites\nbeing down, both at the same time,\n\n294\n00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.970\nunfortunately.\n\n295\n00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.545\nAnd it is one of those things, and\nthat organization would still achieve ISO\n\n296\n00:16:45.545 --> 00:16:50.320\n20000, if they could demonstrate\nthat they had actually\n\n297\n00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.150\ntested their service continuity in\nthe past and that it had worked okay.\n\n298\n00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.490\nAnd that this was just an unfortunate\ncircumstance, it was just a coincidence.\n\n299\n00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.760\nWhich is really what it was,\nit was just an unfortunate coincidence.\n\n300\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.730\nI mean, it was really unfortunate.\n\n301\n00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.800\nAnd it doesnt mean that their\nservice continuity was bad.\n\n302\n00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.370\nIt just meant that at the time,\n\n303\n00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:13.040\nwhen one site was down,\nthe other site developed a fault.\n\n304\n00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.200\nSo I'm looking for evidence,\nthough, that tests happen, and it's\n\n305\n00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.240\nnot just a walk-through of a plan, and\nwe say yes, okay, I can check these boxes.\n\n306\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.350\nLook at this.\nYou've got to\n\n307\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:28.740\ntest plans against the requirements and\nretest after major changes.\n\n308\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.500\nYou've gotta record the test results.\n\n309\n00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.500\nAnd we've got to test it.\n\n310\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.420\nThis is not just a walk-through.\n\n311\n00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.690\nIt's gotta be tested.\n\n312\n00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.820\nMost organizations just\ndon't like to do that.\n\n313\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.330\nAnd it's not just about the money,\n\n314\n00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.080\nit's also about the loss of\ncredibility if something goes wrong.\n\n315\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:51.650\nIt's also about the amount of our\npayroll that it can create as well.\n\n316\n00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.590\nBut if you don't test your\nservice continuity and\n\n317\n00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:59.603\nyou cannot demonstrate that regular\ntests are happening, then you know,\n\n318\n00:17:59.603 --> 00:18:05.550\nan achievement of ISO 20000 is going to\nbe, well you're not going to achieve it.\n\n319\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.292\nWe need to see that you\ntest service continuity.\n\n320\n00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:14.320\nWe'd love to all be in a place where\nservice continuity happens just kind\n\n321\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.270\nof like that, where nobody notices,\nwhere we've got mirrored environments,\n\n322\n00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:24.210\nand where no one actually notices which\nserver is the one that's actually live and\n\n323\n00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.109\nonline right now.\n\n324\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.690\nBut we realize that that's\nnot always the case.\n\n325\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.690\nAnd so, if you're looking for\nassistance with\n\n326\n00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.560\nservice continuity mechanisms from a very\nhigh level, you can look to ITIL, but\n\n327\n00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.200\nthen there are also other standards\nin place for service continuity.\n\n328\n00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.970\nThere are other methodologies purely for\n\n329\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.140\nservice continuity that\nwill help with this.\n\n330\n00:18:47.873 --> 00:18:51.330\nSo let's move into budgeting and\naccounting.\n\n331\n00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:55.450\nNow I know I've already said that when we\nlooked at just the brief introduction to\n\n332\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:00.900\nour delivery processes I had already\nmentioned that we didn't include\n\n333\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:06.830\ncharging in this and we can't,\nbecause charging is optional.\n\n334\n00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.780\nAnd so, some organizations will charge for\nexternal service providers.\n\n335\n00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.950\nYou charge external customers,\nbut for internal customers,\n\n336\n00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.115\nyou don't charge, or not necessarily.\n\n337\n00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:21.205\nSo in that case then,\nwe can't include that\n\n338\n00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:24.595\nas part of a mandatory requirement\nwhen not everybody does it.\n\n339\n00:19:24.595 --> 00:19:27.388\n&gt;&gt; And Jo, just in case someone might\nnot have heard that term before,\n\n340\n00:19:27.388 --> 00:19:30.573\ncan you explain exactly what you're\nreferencing when you're talking about\n\n341\n00:19:30.573 --> 00:19:32.412\ninternal charging there?\n\n342\n00:19:32.412 --> 00:19:36.552\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sometimes organizations\nwill choose, especially the large\n\n343\n00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:43.042\norganizations, will choose to charge\ninternal cost centers for services.\n\n344\n00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:48.302\nAnd we can go back to, if you take a look\nat ITIL for a more detailed explanation.\n\n345\n00:19:48.302 --> 00:19:52.890\nTake a look in service strategy, and\nwithin service strategy we did quite a few\n\n346\n00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.495\nshows about financial management, and\nwithout going into too much debt.\n\n347\n00:19:57.495 --> 00:20:02.293\n[LAUGH] Because financial\nmanagement is very complicated.\n\n348\n00:20:02.293 --> 00:20:07.450\n[LAUGH] Without going into too much debt,\nsome organizations will choose\n\n349\n00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:12.620\nto run their IT service provider\nas maybe a separate entity,\n\n350\n00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.070\nmaybe as a profit center,\nnot even as a cost center.\n\n351\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.232\nAnd so\nthey're looking to demonstrate a return on\n\n352\n00:20:19.232 --> 00:20:23.920\ninvestment by recouping their costs\nfrom the organization itself.\n\n353\n00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.880\n&gt;&gt; Not a bad idea.\n\n354\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, so when an incident is resolved\nfor instance, and this is going very\n\n355\n00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:36.050\nin-depth, and this is a very, very mature\ncharging organization, it should be said.\n\n356\n00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.430\nBut when an incident is resolved, we then-\n&gt;&gt; Bill the department.\n\n357\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; For the service.\n\n358\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.300\n&gt;&gt; For that service.\n\n359\n00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:47.440\nOr we may choose to\ncharge a nominal fee for\n\n360\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.468\na particular service, so\njust for service itself.\n\n361\n00:20:50.468 --> 00:20:54.540\nAnd there are various\ndifferent costs models and\n\n362\n00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.760\ncosts types etc, but\nit basically is a case of demonstrating.\n\n363\n00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.310\nAnd we can use it as a leverage as well\nbecause it's a way of demonstrating that\n\n364\n00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:08.560\ncertain cost centers, certain\ndepartments within our organization\n\n365\n00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.680\nactually use IT more than\nother departments do.\n\n366\n00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:19.380\nSo it also can, we can use that to\nhighlight a training need for instance.\n\n367\n00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:24.510\nIf the service desk are spending more than\n50% of their time providing guidance and\n\n368\n00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.640\ntraining to one particular department.\n\n369\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.880\n&gt;&gt; Especially if it's repetitive\ninformation that's being\n\n370\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.930\nex-\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n371\n00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.800\nSo charging does have its uses,\nit really does, and it really does help to\n\n372\n00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.820\narticulate whether IT is providing value\nfor money to the organization, but\n\n373\n00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.970\nit's not something that\nhappens in all organizations.\n\n374\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, and even if you think from,\neven if upper management,\n\n375\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:51.090\nsomeone ip there in the C level\nmight not understand IT completely,\n\n376\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:55.270\nbut it's a lot easier for\nthem to look at it from a monetary value.\n\n377\n00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, definitely.\n\n378\n00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:02.179\nBut then you also have to consider that\nthere's a cost involved in actually\n\n379\n00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:03.363\ncharging as well.\n\n380\n00:22:03.363 --> 00:22:04.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because then we've gotta\n\n381\n00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.320\nwork out our costs.\n\n382\n00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.250\nWe've gotta work out.\n\n383\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.210\nWe've got to, somebody has got to.\n\n384\n00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.110\nYou then have to pay\nsomebody to sit there and\n\n385\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.160\nwork out the costs in order\nto be able to charge.\n\n386\n00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.530\nSo there's a cost involved in charging.\n\n387\n00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.358\nSo yeah, sometimes you have\nto outweigh the benefits and\n\n388\n00:22:21.358 --> 00:22:23.122\nsort of the pros and cons.\n\n389\n00:22:23.122 --> 00:22:24.344\nWeigh them up and\n\n390\n00:22:24.344 --> 00:22:29.200\njust see which option you\n&gt;&gt; So how much does this episode cost, Jo?\n\n391\n00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.892\n&gt;&gt; How much does this episode cost?\n\n392\n00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:33.475\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, $2,000 maybe, $3,000.\n\n393\n00:22:33.475 --> 00:22:34.738\n&gt;&gt; Priceless job.\n\n394\n00:22:34.738 --> 00:22:36.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n395\n00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.505\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is really.\n\n396\n00:22:37.505 --> 00:22:44.481\nIt is priceless,\ncuz you got me as well, right?\n\n397\n00:22:44.481 --> 00:22:45.140\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n398\n00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.025\n&gt;&gt; Definitely priceless.\n\n399\n00:22:46.025 --> 00:22:47.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n400\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.710\nwhat's the intent then for\nbudgeting and accounting?\n\n401\n00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:56.160\nWell, the intent is to support\nthe provider's understanding and\n\n402\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.810\nability to manage\nthe total cost of services.\n\n403\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.340\nThat's what the intent is, that's a shall.\n\n404\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.850\nBut that is a should, rather,\nthis is a recommendation.\n\n405\n00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.620\nWe wanna support the service\nprovider's understanding,\n\n406\n00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.770\nthat's our understanding\nof what our value is.\n\n407\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:20.080\nWhereas the shall, this is the must-do,\nwhat we must do for budgeting and\n\n408\n00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.620\naccounting is,\n\n409\n00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:26.950\nwe must have a defined interface with\nthe organization's financial processes.\n\n410\n00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.850\nWe must have documented procedures for\nbudgeting and accounting.\n\n411\n00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.590\nBudgeting is how much money\nhave I got to spend and\n\n412\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.660\naccounting is how much money have I spent.\n\n413\n00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.390\nWe must have procedures for\napportioning indirect costs.\n\n414\n00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:48.050\nSo, we must have an ability to account for\nwhere our money is spent.\n\n415\n00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.344\nAnd what about some costs\nthat we call indirect?\n\n416\n00:23:51.344 --> 00:23:57.945\nIn other words, costs that cannot be\nattributed to a specific business unit.\n\n417\n00:23:57.945 --> 00:24:03.054\nSo for instance, our electricity bill.\n\n418\n00:24:03.054 --> 00:24:04.881\nWho uses how much electricity?\n\n419\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.580\nWe don't know, I mean you're looking\nat me blank and that's the answer.\n\n420\n00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.409\n&gt;&gt; Is she asking me right now?\n\n421\n00:24:11.409 --> 00:24:12.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n422\n00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.615\nthat's the general reaction that\nI get anyway most of the time.\n\n423\n00:24:17.615 --> 00:24:21.320\n[LAUGH] That's the general reaction\nthat you'd get when you say to somebody,\n\n424\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.130\nwell how much electricity did you use?\n\n425\n00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.870\nJust imagine trying to work\nthat out in your house.\n\n426\n00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.750\n&gt;&gt; The calculations, yeah, no for\nthe servers and the wattage.\n\n427\n00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.330\nYou could do it.\n\n428\n00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.470\nBut it's not something I could just have,\nknow off the top of my head.\n\n429\n00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.699\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo we'd consider those\n\n430\n00:24:32.699 --> 00:24:33.780\nto be indirect costs.\n\n431\n00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:39.650\nSo they are costs that are not\nattributed to a specific business unit,\n\n432\n00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.550\nand therefore we have to\napportion them as we call that.\n\n433\n00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.700\nIn other words we have to divide it up and\nwe have to say, okay then.\n\n434\n00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.870\nSo, roughly let's say, I mean and\n\n435\n00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.740\nwe can use these with licensing\nfees et cetera as well.\n\n436\n00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.490\nSo we can say, well, our electricity bill\ncosts us a million dollars per months.\n\n437\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.490\nIn that case then,\nwe've got ten business units.\n\n438\n00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.640\nSo i'm going to divide that by ten and\n\n439\n00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.670\nsay okay this is how much it\nis costing per business unit.\n\n440\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:11.550\n'Cuz they have to pay for\nus to be able to operate.\n\n441\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.060\nNow that doesn't mean\nthat we're charging them.\n\n442\n00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:18.230\nIt just means we have to have visible\nacknowledgement of where our costs are,\n\n443\n00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.615\nand we have a visible...\n\n444\n00:25:20.615 --> 00:25:25.245\nTo be able to demonstrate exactly\nwhere we're spending our money.\n\n445\n00:25:25.245 --> 00:25:26.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n446\n00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.440\nIn smaller companies,\nthis also is like what you had mentioned.\n\n447\n00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.270\nIn larger organizations,\nthis is more prevalent.\n\n448\n00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:37.080\nFor example, going out to Microsoft and\nlooking at their systems out there,\n\n449\n00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.080\nit's really cool because a lot of\ncompanies, larger organizations\n\n450\n00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.150\nare looking at alternate sources of\nenergy, and then they're using that.\n\n451\n00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.350\nThey're in-sourcing or\n\n452\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:50.900\nthey have that on premise so they have\ntheir own energy corporation sometimes.\n\n453\n00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n454\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.150\nof course they're gonna want to\nknow how much they're going to be\n\n455\n00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:55.005\nbilling internally.\n\n456\n00:25:55.005 --> 00:26:00.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean we use electricity\nas just one example but there are so\n\n457\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:05.800\nmany other examples of costs that are kind\nof just lost in the ether somewhere.\n\n458\n00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.030\nCosts that we just don't\nthink of ever apportioning.\n\n459\n00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.960\nAnd what we've got to look at, and\n\n460\n00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.950\nwhat we've got to demonstrate in terms of\naudit is, we have got to demonstrate that\n\n461\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:21.090\nwe understand the value of IT and\nthat we know that IT costs money.\n\n462\n00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.730\nAnd therefore,\nwe understand exactly how much value it\n\n463\n00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:28.260\nis delivering to the organization and\nhow much money we're spending.\n\n464\n00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.735\nHow much money we're spending\non things like like electricity,\n\n465\n00:26:31.735 --> 00:26:34.635\nhow much money we're\nspending on licensing.\n\n466\n00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:39.405\nYou know we can only, especially now as we\nstart to move towards Cloud services there\n\n467\n00:26:39.405 --> 00:26:45.205\nis a tendency in a lot of instances to\njust buy a certain amount of storage.\n\n468\n00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:49.406\nAnd then we think to ourselves,\nright I'll buy this amount of storage and\n\n469\n00:26:49.406 --> 00:26:53.608\nthen I'm going to allow people to fill\nthat up without even thinking about\n\n470\n00:26:53.608 --> 00:26:58.041\nhow much you're allocating to each\nindividual business unit for instance.\n\n471\n00:26:58.041 --> 00:26:59.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n472\n00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:06.625\n&gt;&gt; So you should in our audit, you should\nbe able to articulate effective control.\n\n473\n00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:12.345\nYou should be able to articulate that\nbudgeting enables decision-making.\n\n474\n00:27:12.345 --> 00:27:15.175\nWell, there's a difficult\none to articulate too.\n\n475\n00:27:15.175 --> 00:27:19.085\nHow can you demonstrate that the amount of\nmoney actually enables a decision-maker?\n\n476\n00:27:19.085 --> 00:27:23.635\nIn a lot of cases, you're thinking to\nyourself, have I got enough money,\n\n477\n00:27:23.635 --> 00:27:24.285\nyes or no?\n\n478\n00:27:24.285 --> 00:27:26.330\nThat's a decision, right?\n\n479\n00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.950\nYou've got to demonstrate that\nthat's exactly what's happening.\n\n480\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.440\nSo we have to, again, this is a shall.\n\n481\n00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.600\nA shall is we have to monitor,\nwe have to report costs against budget,\n\n482\n00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.640\nwe have to perform adequate accounting,\n\n483\n00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.430\nthat's accounting for\nhow much money have I spent.\n\n484\n00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:51.070\nWe have to demonstrate that we can manage\ncosts, and we have to demonstrate that we\n\n485\n00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:57.180\ncan, well,\nthat we have a bottom line in effect.\n\n486\n00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.240\nWe can demonstrate we're\nproviding value for money, and\n\n487\n00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.590\nthat IT is not a cost center.\n\n488\n00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.110\nIt doesn't necessarily have\nto be a profit center.\n\n489\n00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:10.030\nBut it's not just a drain on resources,\nwhich is how some organizations view IT.\n\n490\n00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.380\nI mean, let's take a look at\nthe boxes down the bottom.\n\n491\n00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.060\nThink about shared resources,\nthink about our overheads,\n\n492\n00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.860\nthink about the facilities and\nour personnel, these are all costs.\n\n493\n00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.700\nNow how do you demonstrate that somebody\nis actually an asset to an organization?\n\n494\n00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.550\nYou have to be able to do that.\n\n495\n00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:28.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n496\n00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.550\nAnd especially for the IT department,\nthings like taking advantage and\n\n497\n00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.010\nleveraging ticketing systems.\n\n498\n00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.870\nWell I think what did you say before,\nwe don't-\n\n499\n00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:36.050\n&gt;&gt; We don't call them that.\n\n500\n00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay!\n\n501\n00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's just my terminology.\n\n502\n00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.230\nBut some way to document, look,\nCherokee spent x amount of hours\n\n503\n00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:47.230\nhandling this particular incident,\nor I was troubleshooting for\n\n504\n00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.790\nx amount of hours and\nthen fill it out accordingly that way.\n\n505\n00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.916\n&gt;&gt; A lot of organizations, and\n\n506\n00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:54.280\na lot of people don't like to\nactually fill out time sheets.\n\n507\n00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.110\nAnd we all hate to fill out time sheets.\n\n508\n00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:00.520\nHowever, in order to achieve ISO 20000,\nwe've got to\n\n509\n00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.070\nhave articulated demonstrable proof\nthat we're delivering value for money.\n\n510\n00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.620\nSo, you know, I have to be able to\ndemonstrate that I am not paying you to\n\n511\n00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.330\nsit around and twiddle your thumbs-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n512\n00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.530\n&gt;&gt; And drink coffee all day.\n\n513\n00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.660\nYou know, I have to demonstrate that\nI am actually getting value for\n\n514\n00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.585\nmoney out of you, and that means value for\nmoney out of your skills and value for\n\n515\n00:29:18.585 --> 00:29:24.355\nmoney out of your time, and what you\ncan contribute to the organization.\n\n516\n00:29:24.355 --> 00:29:29.833\nSo that means then that whilst we don't\nlike to do any form of time management,\n\n517\n00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:33.402\nand we don't like to do any\nform of logging down what\n\n518\n00:29:33.402 --> 00:29:36.845\nwe've done for the day-\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember it may even keep\n\n519\n00:29:36.845 --> 00:29:40.245\nyou employed if you look at, you know,\na comparison between employees.\n\n520\n00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:45.730\nAnd one employee is significantly\nlacking as far as completed tickets or\n\n521\n00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.284\nwhatever terminology you use.\n\n522\n00:29:47.284 --> 00:29:49.646\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not tickets, Right?\n\n523\n00:29:49.646 --> 00:29:50.700\nNot tickets.\n\n524\n00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Service incidents,\nokay, but I don't know.\n\n525\n00:29:55.015 --> 00:29:58.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go to that point in time.\n\n526\n00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.780\nThis is the time where we say no,\nlet's go now [LAUGH].\n\n527\n00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but anyways, yeah,\nit's definitely useful.\n\n528\n00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:05.944\nI can see the value in that.\n\n529\n00:30:05.944 --> 00:30:07.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have to do that.\n\n530\n00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.465\nI mean we wouldn't necessarily\nadvocate comparing-\n\n531\n00:30:09.465 --> 00:30:10.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n532\n00:30:10.177 --> 00:30:11.485\n&gt;&gt; People with each other.\n\n533\n00:30:11.485 --> 00:30:14.700\n[LAUGH] But nevertheless, we have to\ndemonstrate that we're getting value for\n\n534\n00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.966\nmoney from our people-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n535\n00:30:16.966 --> 00:30:18.299\n&gt;&gt; As well as from all\nof our resources too.\n\n536\n00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:22.600\nSo yes, I mean, we have to be able\nto identify training needs, etc.\n\n537\n00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.920\nAnd it's all about getting value for\nmoney out of people.\n\n538\n00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.460\nBut as I've jokingly just said,\nlet's leave it there for a moment.\n\n539\n00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:35.790\nAnd I think what we'll do is we will say\nthat's it for this particular episode.\n\n540\n00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.280\nWe will come back in our next episode and\nwe will carry on with clause six and\n\n541\n00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.200\nwe will carry on taking a look at\nthe remaining service delivery\n\n542\n00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.650\nprocesses here in clause six-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n543\n00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:49.260\nwe've made it to part\nthree here in clause six.\n\n544\n00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.250\n&gt;&gt; We have yes.\n\n545\n00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.970\n&gt;&gt; So ladies and\ngentlemen stay tuned for that.\n\n546\n00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.240\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out now.\n\n547\n00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.760\nI've been your host Cherokee Booths.\n\n548\n00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.720\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Joe Pecocks.\n\n549\n00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:03.522\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITPro TV.\n\n550\n00:31:03.522 --> 00:31:05.320\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC].\n\n551\n00:31:05.320 -->

00:00:10.448\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:17.363\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your ISO/IEC\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n5\n00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:20.400\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.960\nAnd this episode we'll pick back up\nhere at clause six with a part three.\n\n7\n00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.730\nSpecifically we'll be looking\nat service delivery processes.\n\n8\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.300\nAnd back in studios with us today\nwe have ISO expert, Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.540\nHow you doing, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.870\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm well,\nI'm ready to pick back up here so\n\n13\n00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.000\nwe can kinda round things\nout looking at clause six.\n\n14\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.850\nSo, what is the first topic\nthat we'll be discussing here?\n\n15\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're still in our\nservice delivery processes.\n\n16\n00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.130\nSo in our delivery processes,\nwe've been looking at availability and\n\n17\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.260\ncontinuity management.\n\n18\n00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.580\nWe've been looking at reporting and\nservice-level management.\n\n19\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.910\nAnd so, now what we're going to do is\ntake a look at capacity management.\n\n20\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.730\nSo we're gonna jump right in Looking at\nthe requirements for capacity management.\n\n21\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.740\nNow, one of the first things that I wanna\ntell you about capacity management is\n\n22\n00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.360\nthat, capacity relates to the capacity for\nall our components within IT.\n\n23\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.610\nSo it's making sure that we have\nthe right amount of capacity to meet\n\n24\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.360\nall of the requirements\nof the organization.\n\n25\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.500\nWhat I actually mean by that\nis that we've got enough\n\n26\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.670\ncapacity in terms of\nthe technical capacity,\n\n27\n00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.920\nin other words we've got enough bandwidth,\nwe've got enough memory.\n\n28\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.056\nWe've also got enough capacity\nin terms of information.\n\n29\n00:01:36.056 --> 00:01:41.206\nAnd I don't mean just by having enough\ncapacity to store our documents, but\n\n30\n00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:46.840\nalso having enough capacity in terms\nof training information, for instance.\n\n31\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.310\nSo enough capacity in terms of information\n\n32\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.450\nto be able to meet the needs\nof the organization.\n\n33\n00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.430\nSo we have to have enough information.\n\n34\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.190\nIt's not just about being able\nto store it somewhere, but\n\n35\n00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.260\nit's actually having\nit in the first place.\n\n36\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.950\n&gt;&gt; Access to those resources for\nour employees.\n\n37\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.750\n&gt;&gt; Well not just access to the resources.\n\n38\n00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.388\nWe have to have the resources.\n\n39\n00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:09.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] True.\n\n40\n00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we can't just simply\nturn around and say, hey, there you go,\n\n41\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.970\nlog on and use an email.\n\n42\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.440\nWe've gotta tell somebody how to log\non and use an email or send an email.\n\n43\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.640\nAnd then we've gotta have enough\ncapacity in terms of money.\n\n44\n00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.430\nWe've gotta have enough money.\n\n45\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.020\nAnd we're not just talking about things\nlike being able to pay our bills,\n\n46\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.640\nbeing able to pay our licenses.\n\n47\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.410\nBut also, we have to have enough money\nto be able to pay our people as well.\n\n48\n00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.900\nAnd that comes onto the, and you notice\nI've left into last, the human capacity.\n\n49\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.330\nAnd when we talk about human capacity,\nI mean having enough people with\n\n50\n00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.820\nthe right amount of skills to be able to\nmeet the needs of the organization and\n\n51\n00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.690\nmeet the needs of our business itself.\n\n52\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.130\n&gt;&gt; And\neven those last two may go together Jo,\n\n53\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.480\nbecause if we think about this industry,\nthe nature of it.\n\n54\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.610\nAnd it's constantly evolving,\nthen a lot of those companies,\n\n55\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.980\nthey should be providing\ncontinual education so\n\n56\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.090\nthat their employees can be\nrelevant in today's technologies.\n\n57\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.207\n&gt;&gt; Well, this actually is what\ncapacity management covers.\n\n58\n00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:12.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah,\n\n59\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.180\nI'm really glad that\nyou've mentioned that.\n\n60\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.480\nCuz we talk about continual improvement.\n\n61\n00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.746\nAnd we talk about continual improvement,\nwhen we looked at our ITIL framework,\n\n62\n00:03:20.746 --> 00:03:23.710\nwe looked at continual improvement for\nour processes.\n\n63\n00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.335\nBut here within ISO 20000,\n\n64\n00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:32.600\nwe're measuring our ability to be able\nto deliver value to our customers.\n\n65\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.460\nAnd here we're measuring not only that\nwe have the right number of people,\n\n66\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.220\nbut they have the right skills.\n\n67\n00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.100\nAnd of course every time we bring in a new\nservice, then we're probably going to have\n\n68\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.390\nto revisit how many support people we have\nand the skills of those support people.\n\n69\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.040\nAnd as we move into a strategy\nsupporting the strategy for\n\n70\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.410\nthe organization, whatever that strategy\nmay be that the organization has and\n\n71\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.050\nwe've got to make sure that we in\nIT are able to support any strategy\n\n72\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.410\nthat the organization\nmay want to implement.\n\n73\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.390\nSo, when it says here under part 2,\nthis is the intent, this is a should.\n\n74\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.210\nWe should be in a position\nwhere we as a service provider\n\n75\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.830\nhave enough capacity to meet the current\nand future needs of the organization.\n\n76\n00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.210\nAnd that is not just in\nrelation to technical,\n\n77\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.420\nwhich is the first place\nthat we go to in IT.\n\n78\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.565\nSo what are we actually auditing against?\n\n79\n00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:33.320\nWell, I want to see, remember the show me?\n\n80\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.090\nI want to see that you have got\ndocumented capacity requirements.\n\n81\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.980\nAnd that you have enough capacity\nto meet the requirements.\n\n82\n00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.440\nSo, that you have a plan in place for how\nyou are going to meet those requirements\n\n83\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.040\nand that you are able to\nmonitor your capacity usage and\n\n84\n00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.220\nthat you're able to predict\ncapacity usage as well.\n\n85\n00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.070\nThat's what the plan is all about.\n\n86\n00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.930\nAnd that's why we're able to, we need\nto be able to analyze capacity usage.\n\n87\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.720\nAnd when able to perform fine\ntuning activities as well,\n\n88\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.150\nand I wanna see evidence of all those.\n\n89\n00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.360\nSo I want to see that capacity\nis routinely managed.\n\n90\n00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.100\nI want to see.\n\n91\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.700\nI don't want to just\nturn around to you and\n\n92\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.290\nsay what's the bandwidth utilization\ncurrently on your network?\n\n93\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.760\nI want to see what the bandwidth\nutilization is on your network or\n\n94\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.860\nwhat it has been over the past month and\nover the past six months.\n\n95\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.140\nAnd what's the trend?\n\n96\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.910\nShow me your peaks and your troughs.\n\n97\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.650\nWhen is bandwidth excessively utilized,\nwhen is it not?\n\n98\n00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.026\nNow, we have processes that covered\nwithin the ITIL framework that\n\n99\n00:05:42.026 --> 00:05:48.347\nwould help you to manage your capacity and\nhelp you to identify peaks and troughs.\n\n100\n00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:53.320\nSo they will help you to\nachieve your ISO 20000.\n\n101\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.398\nSo if you're looking for techniques\nto help you demonstrate the part 1,\n\n102\n00:05:58.398 --> 00:06:03.160\nthe shalls, then ITIL is not a bad\nplace to start because they have some\n\n103\n00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.190\nprocesses in place that\ncan help you with this.\n\n104\n00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.770\nUltimately, we are concerned with\nthe capacity of all of our components.\n\n105\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.100\nAnd the components of our service\nincludes software and hardware.\n\n106\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.020\nBut it also includes\nthe environmental components.\n\n107\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.050\nHave we got enough outlets in our\nwalls to be able to plug in and\n\n108\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.750\nI mean electrical outlets,\nto be able to plug in all of our devices?\n\n109\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.650\nHave we got enough network ports in our\nwalls to be able to plug in in our devices\n\n110\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.570\nfor instance?\n\n111\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.070\nSo we're talking about having enough\ncapacity for all of our components.\n\n112\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.790\nAnd having enough capacity for\nour services and\n\n113\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.550\nhaving enough capacity to meet\nthe entire needs of the organization.\n\n114\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.540\nWe have to have a capacity plan.\n\n115\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.070\nAnd that plan has to include, now these\nare the shalls, this is your part 1.\n\n116\n00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.340\nSo I'm gonna say to you,\nshow me the evidence.\n\n117\n00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.080\nYour plan has to include the human and\nthe technical and\n\n118\n00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.560\nthe data and\nfinancial planning for capacity.\n\n119\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.590\nIt includes, as I've already said,\nand this is what I want to see,\n\n120\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.980\nthis is your shall.\n\n121\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.860\nI want to see your current\ncapacity utilization.\n\n122\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.009\nAnd I want to see\na forecast based on trends.\n\n123\n00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.960\nI want to see expected impact.\n\n124\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.530\nI want to see a risk analysis.\n\n125\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.840\nI want to see timescales, I want to\nsee thresholds, I want to see custom\n\n126\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.640\ninformation, I want to see impactive\nchanges on capacity utilization.\n\n127\n00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.650\nAnd I want to see, as I've already said,\nI wanna see trending and\n\n128\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.190\ntherefore I want to see predictions.\n\n129\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.400\nI want to see my plans for\ncapacity utilization.\n\n130\n00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.620\nThis, after all, is,\nat the moment, the plan.\n\n131\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.310\nAnd so, therefore, in my plan,\nwe've got to do some planning.\n\n132\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.030\nIt's not all about looking backwards.\n\n133\n00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.820\nIt's not all about seeing\nwhat we've done in the past.\n\n134\n00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.520\nIt's about seeing what we're\ngoing to do in the future and\n\n135\n00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.480\nwhat we need in the future.\n\n136\n00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.490\nSo, that's capacity management.\n\n137\n00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.396\nAnd capacity management, as you can see,\nout of the 259 requirements\n\n138\n00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:11.810\nthat there are within part 1,\nour mandatory requirements.\n\n139\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.980\nAnd capacity management,\n\n140\n00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.260\nyou might think well it doesn't\nreally have too many requirements.\n\n141\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.690\nBut it does, just think about\nhow in depth they need to be.\n\n142\n00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.320\n&gt;&gt; Well I was kind of curious about that.\n\n143\n00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.430\nI see how you have your\nbullet points there, Jo.\n\n144\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.970\nBut then you have those sub,\nthe indentions for those dependencies.\n\n145\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.722\nSo would those be counted\nas part of that 259?\n\n146\n00:08:30.722 --> 00:08:31.222\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n147\n00:08:31.222 --> 00:08:34.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it has to include this.\n\n148\n00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.130\nSo they would be,\nwhen I say would they be part of the 259,\n\n149\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.210\nthe scope is part of the 259.\n\n150\n00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so those are not technically\naccounted for with that numerical value.\n\n151\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.211\nThose are just required as well.\n\n152\n00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:48.871\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwell they're not required as well,\n\n153\n00:08:48.871 --> 00:08:51.245\nthat's what I expect to see in the scope.\n\n154\n00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:56.595\nSo I expect to see a plan and\nI expect the plan to include human,\n\n155\n00:08:56.595 --> 00:08:58.955\ntechnical, information and\nfinancial resources.\n\n156\n00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:03.940\nSo if I see a plan that doesn't have\nany mention for human resources, for\n\n157\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.362\ninstance, then I'm gonna say, no,\nI'm sorry, but that's not adequate.\n\n158\n00:09:08.362 --> 00:09:10.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n159\n00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.750\nIt depends on the scale, but\nthat would be either a major or\n\n160\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.270\nminor non-conformance, but\nit would be a nonconformance.\n\n161\n00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.110\nBecause even though the scope\nitself is just one requirement,\n\n162\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.270\nit doesn't meet all of\nthe specifications for that requirement.\n\n163\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwe wouldn't be checking off one, two,\n\n164\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.660\nthree, four,\nfive off of our checklist there.\n\n165\n00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.760\nWe'd just be checking the one.\n\n166\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.430\n&gt;&gt; Just the one, yeah.\n\n167\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.854\nAnd we've got 259 of these.\n\n168\n00:09:35.854 --> 00:09:37.513\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n169\n00:09:37.513 --> 00:09:39.859\n&gt;&gt; So just a few, that's okay, just a few.\n\n170\n00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.250\nSo let's take a look then at\nsecurity management then.\n\n171\n00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.698\nNow, we do acknowledge\nsecurity management and\n\n172\n00:09:48.698 --> 00:09:52.612\nyou'll see that we've got a part 2 here.\n\n173\n00:09:52.612 --> 00:09:57.580\nAnd part 2 is just that you should\nhave security controls in place, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.730\nThis is your part 2,\nwe should be protecting our, think CIA,\n\n175\n00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.610\nour confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of our information.\n\n176\n00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.195\nMaking sure that it's kept confidential,\nthat we can ensure the integrity,\n\n177\n00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:13.365\nand that it's only available to\nthose that should have access to it.\n\n178\n00:10:13.365 --> 00:10:17.798\nBut we have ISO 27002, that is the latest\n\n179\n00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:23.610\nversion of the International Standard\nof Security.\n\n180\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:29.232\nSo whilst we will cover security\nto a certain level within\n\n181\n00:10:29.232 --> 00:10:34.268\nISO 20000,\nwe do not cover it in depth because\n\n182\n00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:39.202\nthere is a separate standard for\nISO 27002.\n\n183\n00:10:39.202 --> 00:10:44.060\nWith that said, there are a lot of\norganizations that don't want to accredit\n\n184\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.694\nthemselves with an ISO 27002, but\nthey still want to achieve the ISO\n\n185\n00:10:48.694 --> 00:10:53.950\n20000 accreditation, which means that\nwe've gotta think about security.\n\n186\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:58.842\nYou can't just ignore security and\npretend it's not happening because if\n\n187\n00:10:58.842 --> 00:11:02.723\nyou don't have the right\nsecurity restrictions in place,\n\n188\n00:11:02.723 --> 00:11:07.710\nthen quite simply, you won't actually\nbe able to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n189\n00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.760\nOr at least you won't be able to retain it\nfor very long, because things will change.\n\n190\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:19.610\n[LAUGH] Because your security is too,\nwell I was gonna use the word scarce.\n\n191\n00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.340\nIt's not necessarily scarce but\nif it's not robust enough then obviously--\n\n192\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.400\n&gt;&gt; And adequate.\n\n193\n00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and adequate works.\n\n194\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.870\nWe wanna make sure that you\ndo have security in place.\n\n195\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.550\nSo your security policy itself.\n\n196\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.760\nHere is a shall.\n\n197\n00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.630\nThe security policy is\napproved by management.\n\n198\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.615\nSo, the policy that is\navailable to everybody, well,\n\n199\n00:11:44.615 --> 00:11:47.030\nit needs to be approved by management.\n\n200\n00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:51.460\nManagement should communicate\nthe policy to appropriate people.\n\n201\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.480\nJust as a quick question.\n\n202\n00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.570\nWho do you think should have\naccess to your security policy?\n\n203\n00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.440\n&gt;&gt; Everyone in the organization.\n\n204\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.495\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, absolutely everybody.\n\n205\n00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:05.270\nAnd it says here that management have\na responsibility and this is a shall.\n\n206\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.950\nManagement have a responsibility\nto communicate the policy to\n\n207\n00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.290\nappropriate personal.\n\n208\n00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.620\nSo do you one of the things\nthat I do to check this?\n\n209\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.940\n&gt;&gt; You go around and\nask a random employee.\n\n210\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.990\n&gt;&gt; I'll go around and\nask a random person, you're right and\n\n211\n00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.100\nI'll just say where's\nyour IT security policy?\n\n212\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.090\nAnd if they turn around and\n\n213\n00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.650\nsay I don't know or-\n&gt;&gt; What is that?\n\n214\n00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or what is that, then guess what?\n\n215\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.160\nYou haven't met one of your\nmandatory requirements,\n\n216\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.750\nbecause your mandatory requirement is not\nonly that you have a security policy but\n\n217\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:41.100\nthat it's communicated and\nthat everybody is fully aware of that.\n\n218\n00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.280\nSo management communicate the policy.\n\n219\n00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.110\nAnd so I'd expect people to know where\nthe policy is and know how to access it.\n\n220\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.440\nManagement have got to ensure\nthose security management\n\n221\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.330\nobjectives are established.\n\n222\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.100\nSo it's management's responsibility to\nensure that there are objectives for\n\n223\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.260\nsecurity management.\n\n224\n00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:05.400\nSo again, show me, show me the objectives,\nshow me the approach for managing risks.\n\n225\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.169\nShow me what your risk\nmanagement methodology is.\n\n226\n00:13:09.169 --> 00:13:10.707\nShow me how you manage risks.\n\n227\n00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:15.150\nI want to see evidence that you have\nidentified security risks in the past,\n\n228\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.522\nthat you have a mechanism for identifying\nsecurity risks in the future and\n\n229\n00:13:19.522 --> 00:13:24.270\nthat you've done something with\nthe security risks that you've identified.\n\n230\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.700\nI want to see evidence that internal\nsecurity audits are done and\n\n231\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.920\nthat are reviewed.\n\n232\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.560\nAnd that there are opportunities for\n\n233\n00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.450\nimprovement identified\nin your security audits.\n\n234\n00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.970\nShow me.\n\n235\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.263\nShow me what you have.\n\n236\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.570\nAnd then we carry on\nwith security controls.\n\n237\n00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.800\nAnd again, I'm gonna say the same thing.\n\n238\n00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.080\nShow me, show me the controls.\n\n239\n00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.810\nShow me what you are implementing to,\nwell,\n\n240\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:01.450\nensure that you have physical security\nthat you can preserve the CIA and\n\n241\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.610\nthat you are upholding all of\nthe clauses in your security policy and\n\n242\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.980\nthat you are achieving those objectives\nand then you are managing risks.\n\n243\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.480\nShow me.\n\n244\n00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.800\nShow me that you're reviewing your\nsecurity controls on a regular basis.\n\n245\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.360\nAnd I want to see a list of what\nexternal organizations actually have\n\n246\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.510\naccess to your IT,\nhave access to your infrastructure.\n\n247\n00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.630\nWhether they do this on your behalf\nbecause they're managing your\n\n248\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.790\ninfrastructure or\n\n249\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:36.720\nwhether they are doing this because\nthey are working as a partner with you.\n\n250\n00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.120\nI want to see what access they have.\n\n251\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.270\nAnd I want to see what security\nprofile you've given them.\n\n252\n00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:49.110\nSo you may use things like\naccess management as a process.\n\n253\n00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.090\nYou may use that to help demonstrate this.\n\n254\n00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.760\n&gt;&gt; Even like Active Directory?\n\n255\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.210\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n256\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.310\nActive Directory,\nthat will show me some of this.\n\n257\n00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.210\nIt doesn't show me the external\norganizations, but\n\n258\n00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.050\nit'll show me that you've\ngot controls in place.\n\n259\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.280\nAnd it will show me that\nyou have the control for\n\n260\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.510\nexternal people most definitely.\n\n261\n00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.030\nSo yes, that will help.\n\n262\n00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.930\nThat will definitely help.\n\n263\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:17.530\nAnd we've also gotta make sure\nthat when something happens,\n\n264\n00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:23.445\nwhen there is a change to a new service,\nwhen we're bringing in a new service.\n\n265\n00:15:23.445 --> 00:15:26.205\nDon't forget,\nwe're in service delivery here.\n\n266\n00:15:26.205 --> 00:15:27.875\nWe're in delivery processes.\n\n267\n00:15:27.875 --> 00:15:31.541\nSo when we're bringing in a new service,\nyou've got to\n\n268\n00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:35.993\nshow me that that new service has\nbeen assessed for security risks.\n\n269\n00:15:35.993 --> 00:15:40.953\nAnd that that new service or\nthe change to an existing service, well,\n\n270\n00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:45.290\nthat we've considered\nsecurity in any change.\n\n271\n00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:50.040\nAnd you've also got to show me that\nyou have a mechanism in place for\n\n272\n00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.240\ndealing with security incidents,\nwhen there is a security breach,\n\n273\n00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.310\nwhen something goes wrong.\n\n274\n00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.980\nSo I want to see you your process\nof dealing with security incidents.\n\n275\n00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.690\nI want to see what happens.\n\n276\n00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:09.430\nI want to see that you have prioritization\nset for your security incidents.\n\n277\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.860\nI want to see that you're able to\nanalyze the security incidents.\n\n278\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.870\nI want to see how many security\nincidents you've had and\n\n279\n00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.320\nI want to see the impact and I want to see\nwhat you've done about it, in other words,\n\n280\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.200\nyour opportunities for improvement.\n\n281\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.505\nI know I sound very needy.\n\n282\n00:16:25.505 --> 00:16:30.020\n[LAUGH] I carry on sound really\nneedy throughout through these\n\n283\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.180\nparticular episodes for ISO 20000.\n\n284\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.161\nBut essentially I want to see evidence so\n\n285\n00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:39.554\nyes I sound needy because I want\nyou to show me what you have.\n\n286\n00:16:39.554 --> 00:16:44.666\nOkay, so as far as service\ndelivery processes are concerned,\n\n287\n00:16:44.666 --> 00:16:48.430\nwell, we've now looked at clause six.\n\n288\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:53.160\nAnd so, when we come back,\nwe will be looking at our other clauses.\n\n289\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.290\nWe've still have clauses seven through\nclause nine to look at and to analyze and\n\n290\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.230\nlook at what the requirements\nare of these particular clauses.\n\n291\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.780\nSo we will be doing that\nin a subsequent episode.\n\n292\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.481\nAll right, Jo,\n\n293\n00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:08.103\nI have a feeling that you're gonna give us\nmore shalls here with clause number seven.\n\n294\n00:17:08.103 --> 00:17:11.190\nSo ladies and gentlemen,\nyou don't want to miss those, stay tuned.\n\n295\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.310\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n296\n00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.860\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n297\n00:17:14.860 -->

seven,\n\n8\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.370\nreally looking at relationship processes.\n\n9\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.310\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have ISO expert, Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.490\nHow's it going Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.417\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, Cherokee,\nand I'm so pleased to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:39.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, me too, I mean, we're looking\nat relationship processes here.\n\n13\n00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.330\nWe're definitely not gonna be giving\nout any dating advice, right?\n\n14\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.505\n&gt;&gt; Not in this show, anyway.\n\n15\n00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:47.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe in another show.\n\n16\n00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.670\nYes, this is not the channel for this.\n\n17\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.800\n&gt;&gt; So what specifically are we talking\nabout when we say relationship?\n\n18\n00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.570\nRelationships between\ndifferent department,\n\n19\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.920\nrelationships with our customers,\nour businesses?\n\n20\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's take a look at the slide,\nshall we?\n\n21\n00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.470\nHere's one I prepared earlier.\n\n22\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.400\nHere's not one that I prepared earlier,\nthere we go, it's there,\n\n23\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.600\nI knew it was there somewhere, hidden.\n\n24\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.835\nIt's a very shy relationship,\nin this case.\n\n25\n00:01:11.835 --> 00:01:13.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're looking at actually\n\n26\n00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.750\nthe relationship with our business, and\n\n27\n00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.980\nwe're also looking at the relationship\nwith our suppliers, as well.\n\n28\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.786\nSo, we're looking actually at\nrelationships outside of IT.\n\n29\n00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:24.468\nAnd in ISO 20000,\n\n30\n00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:29.610\nwe want to make sure that you actually\nhave relationships outside of IT.\n\n31\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.715\nAnd that you're able to manage them\nin an efficient and an effective way.\n\n32\n00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:34.631\nIn other words,\n\n33\n00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:39.010\nwe don't want an IT service provider\nthat's working in a complete silo.\n\n34\n00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.510\nThat has no interaction with the business,\nno interaction with suppliers.\n\n35\n00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.800\n&gt;&gt; And Cortana doesn't count.\n\n36\n00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:46.890\n&gt;&gt; Who on earth is that?\n\n37\n00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.060\nAre you talking about Siri?\n\n38\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.770\nSiri's nemesis.\n\n39\n00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.812\n&gt;&gt; Really, I'm not that good a nemesis,\ncuz I don't--\n\n40\n00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:54.503\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:56.811\n&gt;&gt; Think anybody else has ever heard of\n\n42\n00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:57.503\nthem, right.\n\n43\n00:01:57.503 --> 00:01:58.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n44\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.140\n&gt;&gt; No, Cortana doesn't count, but\nI'm sure there was a movie about that.\n\n45\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.100\nYes there was.\n\n46\n00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you told me about that.\n\n47\n00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, some.\n&gt;&gt; Where they had, yes.\n\n48\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.270\n&gt;&gt; Let's carry on.\n&gt;&gt; An AI relationship, so\n\n49\n00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.220\nthat doesn't count.\n\n50\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's move on, please.\n\n51\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, shall we?\n\n52\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.364\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nlet's talk about real relationships here.\n\n53\n00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.367\nBefore we delve too much\ninto your psyche [LAUGH].\n\n54\n00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.340\nLet's take a look at business\nrelationship management,\n\n55\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.380\nnow let's see what we're going to test.\n\n56\n00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.030\nAnd we're not just going to test that\nyou know how to talk to Siri, or\n\n57\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.120\nCortana, or Watson.\n\n58\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.985\nLet's be completely impartial here.\n\n59\n00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:36.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; What we're actually going to do is\n\n60\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.660\nwe're going to test that you're\nable to talk to your business.\n\n61\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.390\nAnd you are able to talk\nthe same languages your business.\n\n62\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.900\nBecause that can be a challenge, as well.\n\n63\n00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.930\nAnd that you are able to talk\nto your suppliers, as well.\n\n64\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.788\nSo we have requirements, and requirements\nfor business relationship management.\n\n65\n00:02:53.788 --> 00:02:57.021\nThese are your you have\nto show me evidence of\n\n66\n00:02:57.021 --> 00:03:00.470\nthe fact that you know\nwho your customers are.\n\n67\n00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.950\nAnd who your users are, and\nwho your stakeholders are.\n\n68\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.135\nIn other words, any interested party.\n\n69\n00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.261\nYou have to show me evidence that not only\ndo you have maybe a CRM, for instance.\n\n70\n00:03:12.261 --> 00:03:15.800\nThat will help you,\nCustomer Relationship Management Database.\n\n71\n00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.160\nBut you also have to show me\nwho your customer contact is.\n\n72\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.140\nIt should be an individual\nwithin your team, within IT,\n\n73\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.260\nwho is going to manage the relationship\nbetween IT and the customer.\n\n74\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.480\nSo you have to know who your customer is,\nbut\n\n75\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.910\nyou also have to have somebody\nassigned to manage that relationship.\n\n76\n00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.060\nNow, this is ISO 20000, so\nwe don't care what you call him.\n\n77\n00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.290\nYou could call him or her,\nthe business relationship manager, or\n\n78\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.640\nyou could call him Fred.\n\n79\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.311\nWe're not really bothered about what you\ncall him and what label you give him.\n\n80\n00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:59.224\nWe want to know that you have got\na designated somebody to managed that\n\n81\n00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:01.210\nrelationship.\n\n82\n00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.660\nWe also want to see a visible,\ndefined communication mechanism for\n\n83\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.910\nhow to communicate with the customer.\n\n84\n00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.500\nHow we gain information\nback from the customer.\n\n85\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.400\nAnd, how we gain information\nregarding new requirements.\n\n86\n00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.530\nAnd also,\nhow we feedback to the customer, as well.\n\n87\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.090\nSo I want to see evidence\nof where you have\n\n88\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.270\ntaken information from the customer, and\nwhat you've done with that information.\n\n89\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.020\nMaybe it's in a CRM,\nmaybe it's in a database.\n\n90\n00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.948\nMaybe it's in a business\nrelationship management database.\n\n91\n00:04:35.948 --> 00:04:40.230\nI want to see somewhere where you\nhave stored information about\n\n92\n00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.670\ninteractions with your customer.\n\n93\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.660\nI need to see the evidence, show me.\n\n94\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.450\nThe intent, the should,\nis all about establishing and\n\n95\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.170\nmaintaining a relationship between\nthe service provider and the customers.\n\n96\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.300\nNow it's difficult, really,\nto articulate a relationship.\n\n97\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.250\nBut an outcome should be\nimprove customer satisfaction.\n\n98\n00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.671\nSo, it's not so difficult to articulate\nimprove customer satisfaction,\n\n99\n00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:10.963\nbecause we should be able to see\nimproved satisfaction most definitely.\n\n100\n00:05:10.963 --> 00:05:13.609\nWhat we might want to do,\nand what I would really,\n\n101\n00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:16.710\nreally recommend that we do\nis something similar to this.\n\n102\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.450\nWe should have a, well,\nmapping of customers to our services.\n\n103\n00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.179\nSo we should have a list of who uses,\nwhat services we have, and\n\n104\n00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:28.690\nthen, who uses those services.\n\n105\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.224\nSo, we can see here that sales and\nmarketing, our customers,\n\n106\n00:05:32.224 --> 00:05:34.100\nthe head of sales and marketing.\n\n107\n00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.000\nCuz of course, we know the difference\nbetween a customer and a user.\n\n108\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.992\nAnd the customer uses,\nnot only personal computing, but they use.\n\n109\n00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:46.360\nIf we're looking at head of sales and\nmarketing, they use retail services,\n\n110\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.970\nthey use the company's website,\nthey use financial services also.\n\n111\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.394\nSo we need to be able to articulate\nhow many customers we have, and\n\n112\n00:05:55.394 --> 00:05:56.961\nwhat services they use.\n\n113\n00:05:56.961 --> 00:06:00.361\nYou know sometimes,\na simple little exercises like this.\n\n114\n00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:04.120\nAnd whilst, we may be going of\nslightly on a tangent here.\n\n115\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.250\nA simple little exercise like this can\nactually reveal some surprising results.\n\n116\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.110\nBecause you'll be surprised how\nmany customers you have and also,\n\n117\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.800\nwhat range of services they use, as well.\n\n118\n00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.720\nIf I look at the head of engineering and\nmaintenance, and I look at what he uses,\n\n119\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.790\nand he uses all sorts of services.\n\n120\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.720\nHe uses personal computing, but\nhe also uses retail services too.\n\n121\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.530\nAnd maybe, in this particular example,\nyou wouldn't expect that.\n\n122\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.810\nHe's also using the company website.\n\n123\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.270\nAnd you might think to yourself,\nwell, why on earth is he using that?\n\n124\n00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.000\nBut he does.\n\n125\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.610\nDid you have a question?\n\n126\n00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.360\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm just looking at\nthis chart here, and I think,\n\n127\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.700\nthis is some great information.\n\n128\n00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.000\nSo, not only are we going to be using\nit per se, in this implementation.\n\n129\n00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.540\nBut, you've already done the work.\n\n130\n00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.690\nSo, we could even take this and say,\nokay, now I can see personal computing.\n\n131\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.009\nAnd then see who's using that,\nor whatever.\n\n132\n00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.705\nAnd if I were doing any kind\nof process improvement or\n\n133\n00:06:57.705 --> 00:07:00.060\ninternal reviews or analyzing.\n\n134\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.150\nI could also look at that and utilize\nthis from the point of voice of customer,\n\n135\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.110\nor giving different perspectives,\nand seeing who utilizes what.\n\n136\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.180\nSo, I wouldn't just use this documentation\nfor this sole purpose, here.\n\n137\n00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, well don't forget, what we're\ndoing here is we're doing an audit.\n\n138\n00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.180\nWe're doing ISO 20000.\n\n139\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.790\nSo, we are checking that you\nhave this information in place.\n\n140\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.930\nThat you already have this to hand.\n\n141\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.698\nIt's something like ITIL,\na framework like ITIL.\n\n142\n00:07:26.698 --> 00:07:30.770\nIf you look at the business relationship\nmanagement process within ITIL.\n\n143\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.320\nI'd expect business\nrelationship management to have\n\n144\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.710\nundertaken this exercise, and\nto actually have this information to hand.\n\n145\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.508\nNow in order to achieve\nISO 20000 compliance,\n\n146\n00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:43.271\nyou do have to have information\nabout your customers..\n\n147\n00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:47.860\nBut it's business relationship management\nwithin ITIL that actually builds this\n\n148\n00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.822\ninformation, that actually\nbuilds this database.\n\n149\n00:07:50.822 --> 00:07:55.319\nAnd that then Will talk to other\nprocesses, and we're going to be, a little\n\n150\n00:07:55.319 --> 00:08:00.690\nbit later on, we're going to be auditing\nthe relationships between the processes.\n\n151\n00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.100\nAnd as you've already seen there,\n\n152\n00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.750\nsomething like this is going to be\nused by service catalog management, or\n\n153\n00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.880\nin mapping our service catalog,\nour catalog of services.\n\n154\n00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.710\nIt's going to be used by other processes\nsuch as incident management to identify\n\n155\n00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.590\nwho actually may have an incident or\n\n156\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.730\ninterruption to service, and\nwho should be using what services.\n\n157\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.830\nIt might be used by security management or\n\n158\n00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.030\nby an access management\ntype process as well.\n\n159\n00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:31.420\nSo all of these tools\nthat we are looking at,\n\n160\n00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.940\neverything that we are auditing,\nwe're auditing it for a reason.\n\n161\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.880\nBecause we're auditing it because\nwe need to know it's in place\n\n162\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.730\nbecause it does enhance those\ntypes of relationships.\n\n163\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.360\nAnd that's why we've simply got them.\n\n164\n00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.930\nWe've simply got these particular\ntools and techniques in place here,\n\n165\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:55.440\nnot just to help us achieve audits,\nbut to demonstrate an efficiency.\n\n166\n00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.660\nThat's exactly why they're here.\n\n167\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.400\nSo how do we measure then the performance\nof business relationship management given\n\n168\n00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.040\nthat what we're trying to do is we're\ntrying to build up a relationship?\n\n169\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.570\nSo how do we measure\nthe performance of a relationship?\n\n170\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:15.223\nI mean, how do we measure that you and\nI are talking to each other?\n\n171\n00:09:15.223 --> 00:09:16.540\nThat's quite difficult, isn't it?\n\n172\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.960\nAnd so\nwhat we've said in the previous shalls is,\n\n173\n00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.370\nwhat I've said is well, you've got\nto write every conversation down.\n\n174\n00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.500\nYou've got to write\ndown every interaction.\n\n175\n00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.310\nSo every time you say\nsomething to me about, well,\n\n176\n00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.675\nI think I need this, then I need to write\nthat down, I need to have it documented.\n\n177\n00:09:32.675 --> 00:09:38.800\nBut also, I've got to ensure that I\nsit down with you as my customer,\n\n178\n00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.290\nand I review my performance, or\n\n179\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.720\nthe performance of the services that\nyou receive on a regular basis.\n\n180\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.690\nI've got to ensure that I measure your\nsatisfaction, and I've got to ensure\n\n181\n00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.540\nthat if you're not happy,\nthen I'm going to do something about it.\n\n182\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:01.050\nAnd so in the Shalls, these Shalls\nare looking for evidence that all\n\n183\n00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:06.160\nof these have been achieved, that they're\nall actually happening on a regular basis.\n\n184\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.550\nAnd again,\nwe've got to deal with complaints.\n\n185\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.870\nNow, here within ISO 20000,\nwe look specifically at complaints.\n\n186\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.320\nBut I expect us to apply,\n\n187\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.830\nlet's think about this from\na common sense perspective.\n\n188\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.370\nI expect us to apply this\nto compliments as well.\n\n189\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.910\nIt's not just about complaints.\n\n190\n00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.880\nSometimes our customers\nare really happy with us.\n\n191\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.720\nSo we wanna make sure that\nwe can articulate that, too.\n\n192\n00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.750\nBut when we are auditing,\nthis is what we're looking for.\n\n193\n00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:41.905\nWe're looking to see that we have\nan agreement of what's a complaint and\n\n194\n00:10:41.905 --> 00:10:43.770\nwhat's not a complaint.\n\n195\n00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:49.071\nIf I come to you and I say to you\nmy pen doesn't have a lid on it,\n\n196\n00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:52.380\nis that a complaint or\nis that just an observation?\n\n197\n00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.820\n&gt;&gt; I think that's an observation, Jo.\n\n198\n00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, is it?\n\n199\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.908\nBut then if my pen is my service, then my\nservice is not performing as we agreed\n\n200\n00:11:01.908 --> 00:11:04.120\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I would need to know your expectation.\n\n201\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.260\nBecause if I'm sitting here on my desk and\nnone of my pens have lids on them,\n\n202\n00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.620\nthen that would be just an observation.\n\n203\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.970\nYeah, your pen doesn't have a lid.\n\n204\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.190\nYeah, neither does mine [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.860\n&gt;&gt; That would be an observation\nthat she's got a problem with lids.\n\n206\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.509\nThat's what that would\nbe an observation about.\n\n207\n00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:22.134\nBut we have to consider how, what we deal\nwith as a complaint and what we deal with,\n\n208\n00:11:22.134 --> 00:11:24.360\nas in that instance, an observation.\n\n209\n00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.570\nOr what is just a request for\na new functionality.\n\n210\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.210\nSometimes a complaint is\nactually not a complaint, but\n\n211\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.400\nit's just a disguise for\nI want something new.\n\n212\n00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.560\nWell, then tell us that you want something\nnew rather than complain about what you\n\n213\n00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.430\nhave right now.\n\n214\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.900\nThis can be very contentious.\n\n215\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.310\nAnd ISO 20000 is not\nabout being contentious.\n\n216\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.525\nAnd, in fact, all we're doing is auditing\nthat you've got a procedure in place.\n\n217\n00:11:50.525 --> 00:11:53.405\nBut we want to see that you have\ngot a procedure in place that\n\n218\n00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:57.505\nincludes the definition of what is\na complaint and what is not a complaint.\n\n219\n00:11:57.505 --> 00:12:00.395\nBecause we want to remove any ambiguity.\n\n220\n00:12:00.395 --> 00:12:01.115\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n221\n00:12:01.115 --> 00:12:02.885\n&gt;&gt; That's what we've gotta take away.\n\n222\n00:12:02.885 --> 00:12:05.600\nThere shouldn't be the discussion.\n\n223\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.000\nWell, once we've got the procedure in\nplace, there shouldn't be the discussion\n\n224\n00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.450\nas to whether my pen is missing a lid,\nis that a complaint or just a statement?\n\n225\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.060\nWe don't need to have that discussion.\n\n226\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.972\nSo we'll agree that up front that my\npen is missing a lid, then, okay,\n\n227\n00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.487\nthat's just a statement.\n\n228\n00:12:21.487 --> 00:12:24.397\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or it could be a quality\nassurance type issue, and\n\n229\n00:12:24.397 --> 00:12:28.110\nI'm checking to make sure\nthat all the pens have lids.\n\n230\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is something\nthat we agree with the customer\n\n231\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.220\nbecause the customer pays the bill.\n\n232\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.060\nSo this is not something\nthat we agree with the user.\n\n233\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm following.\n\n234\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.105\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n235\n00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:44.115\nWell, and this is where things get funny.\n\n236\n00:12:44.115 --> 00:12:47.735\nNow I like to,\ncertainly when we're talking about ITIL,\n\n237\n00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:52.215\nwe're talking in an ITIL framework,\nI like to use a certain example\n\n238\n00:12:52.215 --> 00:12:54.221\nwhen it comes to the difference\nbetween customers and users.\n\n239\n00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:57.662\nAnd the example that I use,\n\n240\n00:12:57.662 --> 00:13:00.362\nand Cherokee gets sick of me\nusing this example, I know.\n\n241\n00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:02.572\n&gt;&gt; Can we do, okay.\n\n242\n00:13:02.572 --> 00:13:03.202\n&gt;&gt; Can we do what?\n\n243\n00:13:03.202 --> 00:13:06.222\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say can we use\nlike ITProTV as an example?\n\n244\n00:13:06.222 --> 00:13:06.972\n&gt;&gt; Go on then.\n\n245\n00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:10.009\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK].\n\n246\n00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:11.012\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll let you do it.\n\n247\n00:13:11.012 --> 00:13:13.652\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhat if I want to train my IT department,\n\n248\n00:13:13.652 --> 00:13:19.310\nand I'm the customer, and\nI have 15 IT personnel.\n\n249\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.510\nSo I purchase memberships for\nthose 15 employees, so\n\n250\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.590\nthose are going to be the users, or\n\n251\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.680\nin our situation we call them members, so-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n252\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but technically in this\ndialect we're calling them users.\n\n253\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.190\n&gt;&gt; Users, yeah.\n\n254\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.240\n&gt;&gt; So my 15 users are logging in,\nand they have their profiles.\n\n255\n00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.275\nBut I'm the customer because\nI pay the bill for them.\n\n256\n00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:41.873\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n257\n00:13:41.873 --> 00:13:42.584\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n258\n00:13:42.584 --> 00:13:47.640\n&gt;&gt; But then, and this is why we've got to\nget to the realms of a user doesn't tell\n\n259\n00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.860\nus what is a complaint and\nwhat is a observation.\n\n260\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.925\nSo what if the users were not\nhappy with one particular host?\n\n261\n00:13:56.925 --> 00:13:58.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or hostess?\n\n262\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good point there, Jo.\n\n263\n00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n264\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.150\n&gt;&gt; So, number one,\nI don't know if you guys have noticed,\n\n265\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.180\nbut we have these little stars\nunderneath the video here.\n\n266\n00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.034\nSo they might just put like a one\nstar next to Cherokee's name.\n\n267\n00:14:11.034 --> 00:14:11.640\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n268\n00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.545\ngive Jo five stars because Jo's awesome.\n\n269\n00:14:14.545 --> 00:14:15.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That wouldn't happen.\n\n270\n00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.390\n&gt;&gt; So that is a rating system, but\n\n271\n00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.590\nI don't know if that can\nindicate necessarily a complaint.\n\n272\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.480\nBut it may indicate a lack\nof performance or something.\n\n273\n00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n274\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.600\nBut, you see, we're trying to,\nI am trying to-\n\n275\n00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No ambiguity, you said.\n\n276\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:36.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, I said no ambiguity, and\nI am trying to get to a point where I can\n\n277\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:41.420\naudit you on the basis of\nwhether that is a complaint or\n\n278\n00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.355\nwhether that is just an observation.\n\n279\n00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:45.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n280\n00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.600\n&gt;&gt; So you are a customer,\nand you've got 15 users?\n\n281\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and they've all got subscriptions.\n\n282\n00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:58.830\nAnd here I am on behalf of ITPROTV,\nthen, and I'm saying to you, well,\n\n283\n00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.310\nI'm really, really sorry that you don't\nlike the host, but that is our server.\n\n284\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.510\nI'm sorry that you don't like Jo, but\nshe's our subject matter expert for\n\n285\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.280\nthese sort of things, so\nthat's who we're using, I'm afraid.\n\n286\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.638\nThat's all you've got.\n\n287\n00:15:09.638 --> 00:15:12.050\nIs that a complaint or\nis that an observation?\n\n288\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.540\nThat your users don't respond well to Jo?\n\n289\n00:15:17.952 --> 00:15:19.215\n&gt;&gt; A complaint?\n\n290\n00:15:19.215 --> 00:15:20.309\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n\n291\n00:15:20.309 --> 00:15:22.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's take this out of the real world.\n\n292\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.180\nThis is an interesting discussion,\nactually, and this is an important one.\n\n293\n00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.220\nAnd this just proves the point of why\nwe have to have that clarification.\n\n294\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.615\nCuz let's take this out\nof this environment, and\n\n295\n00:15:32.615 --> 00:15:34.290\nlet's put us in a classroom.\n\n296\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n297\n00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.310\n&gt;&gt; Now, if I'm in a classroom,\nI am Jo, obviously.\n\n298\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.150\nThat was the name I was\ngiven when I was born.\n\n299\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.103\nSo I'm Jo, and I'm stood in a classroom.\n\n300\n00:15:43.103 --> 00:15:47.242\nAnd I have got maybe 30 people in front\nof me, and I'm talking to them about,\n\n301\n00:15:47.242 --> 00:15:51.292\nI don't know, let's say we're talking\nabout Agile project management.\n\n302\n00:15:51.292 --> 00:15:56.104\nAnd I give them all a survey at the end\nof this, and then I ask them to,\n\n303\n00:15:56.104 --> 00:16:01.104\nit's completely anonymous, so\nI don't know whose filled out what.\n\n304\n00:16:01.104 --> 00:16:03.842\nBut then I'll ask them to make\ncomments about performance,\n\n305\n00:16:03.842 --> 00:16:06.550\nabout whether they enjoyed the class or\nwhatever.\n\n306\n00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:11.110\nI'm going to ask them to differentiate\nbetween whether the content was useful or\n\n307\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.390\nwhether they actually like the trainer,\nand\n\n308\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.610\nwas the person that was to do in front of\nthem, a person that would help you learn,\n\n309\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.380\nwas it somebody that was professional,\nand courteous, and polite, etc.\n\n310\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.650\nNow, if somebody decided then that\nthey were going to rate me low,\n\n311\n00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.710\nis that a complaint, or\nis that just an observation?\n\n312\n00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:34.426\nCuz they haven't put\nin a formal complaint.\n\n313\n00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:35.906\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n314\n00:16:35.906 --> 00:16:40.362\nSo they're just observing low performance?\n\n315\n00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:45.128\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nis it low performance if it's one person?\n\n316\n00:16:45.128 --> 00:16:47.479\n&gt;&gt; Well, if it's one person,\nyeah, no then-\n\n317\n00:16:47.479 --> 00:16:48.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and 29 people-\n\n318\n00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:49.771\n&gt;&gt; If it's one person maybe they just\n\n319\n00:16:49.771 --> 00:16:52.379\ndidn't mesh well with, you didn't\nmesh well with their learning style.\n\n320\n00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:52.965\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n321\n00:16:52.965 --> 00:16:57.234\nYou see, so this is why we've\ngot to get to that point.\n\n322\n00:16:57.234 --> 00:17:02.400\nThis is why business relationship\nmanagement is so key, and this is why you\n\n323\n00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.652\nhave to have somebody that then picks up\nthe piece of paper at the end of this.\n\n324\n00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:11.205\nYou have to have somebody that then\ncontacts that particular person, or\n\n325\n00:17:11.205 --> 00:17:15.240\nmaybe the customer, the person who's paid\nthe bill, and say, do you know what?\n\n326\n00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.660\nI saw that Cherokee attended\none of Jo's classes, and\n\n327\n00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.260\nshe wasn't particularly happy with Jo.\n\n328\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.542\nCan you tell me a little\nbit more about this?\n\n329\n00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:27.590\nCan you tell me what it was\nthat she didn't like too much?\n\n330\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.960\nWhat was it that she\ndidn't mesh too well with?\n\n331\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.910\nWe have to have that agreement between\nwhat is a complaint and how we follow this\n\n332\n00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.042\nup, and when it comes to an audit I\nwanna see that you've got in place.\n\n333\n00:17:40.042 --> 00:17:42.420\nI want to see that you know\nhow to deal with that.\n\n334\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n335\n00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.596\n&gt;&gt; And that's not something that,\n\n336\n00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:47.290\nyou might think to yourself,\nwell that's actually quite small.\n\n337\n00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.590\nIt's not really something\nthat we need to worry about.\n\n338\n00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.669\nWell it is because it's in\nhere in Part 1 as a shall.\n\n339\n00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:55.450\nYou've got to do this, so yes it is.\n\n340\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.820\nWe have to have a documented procedure for\n\n341\n00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.050\nwhat we're going to do\nwith that information.\n\n342\n00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.120\nBecause whether we've treated it as\na complaint or whether we've treat it\n\n343\n00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.230\njust as an observation,\nwell that will then decide whether it goes\n\n344\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.690\ndown the complaints process or whether\nit just gets logged as an observation.\n\n345\n00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.880\nThat will decide as to whether\nit's been escalated or not.\n\n346\n00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.340\nDoes that need escalation?\n\n347\n00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.778\nA formal complaint will need escalation,\nbut will that actually need an escalation?\n\n348\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:32.270\nThe thing is that you have to agree with\nthe customer as to what is considered\n\n349\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:38.380\na complaint and what is considered\na observation, cuz this service provider,\n\n350\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.370\nI'm the one delivering a training course\nand Cherokee's the one paying, and\n\n351\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.308\nshe's paid for all of her team\nto attend that training course.\n\n352\n00:18:44.308 --> 00:18:47.655\nNow, I'm gonna ask another question.\n\n353\n00:18:47.655 --> 00:18:49.800\nLet's say we dealt with\nthat as a complaint.\n\n354\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.648\nThat means that I'm gonna be calling\nyou up and I'm gonna be saying to you,\n\n355\n00:18:54.648 --> 00:18:58.070\nright I've spoken to Jo about her\nperformance, and so what we've agreed is\n\n356\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.514\nthat Jo will come back and she'll work\nwith that person on a one to one basis.\n\n357\n00:19:01.514 --> 00:19:04.740\nYou might turn around and say, actually,\nI don't want any of this hassle.\n\n358\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.100\nThe person got the training course,\nthey passed their test,\n\n359\n00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.180\nthat's all I'm interested in.\n\n360\n00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.867\nSo that again, might influence us to\nwhether we deal with that as a complaint\n\n361\n00:19:13.867 --> 00:19:16.940\nor whether we deal with that\nas just an observation.\n\n362\n00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.610\nSo maybe the question that you have to ask\nyourself is, do I need to follow this up,\n\n363\n00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.070\nyes or no?\n\n364\n00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.450\nBecause if you don't need to follow it up\nthen it shouldn't be a complaint, perhaps.\n\n365\n00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.450\nI don't know, it's your organization,\nonly you know, but\n\n366\n00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.690\nI'm gonna check that you have got\na mechanism in place to do that.\n\n367\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:41.034\nI don't know how you do it, but I'm gonna\ncheck that you have got a mechanism\n\n368\n00:19:41.034 --> 00:19:45.975\nin place, and so we apply the same sort\nof principles when we look at supplier\n\n369\n00:19:45.975 --> 00:19:50.997\nmanagement, and supplier management\nis all about managing our suppliers,\n\n370\n00:19:50.997 --> 00:19:55.200\nand it says that about provision\nof seamless quality services.\n\n371\n00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.553\nThis doesn't include supply selection and\nprocurement either,\n\n372\n00:19:59.553 --> 00:20:04.090\nbecause that is done very uniquely\nwithin every organization.\n\n373\n00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.081\nIt's down to your organization and to\nyour organizational ethics as to how you\n\n374\n00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:10.317\nprocure and\nas to how you select suppliers,\n\n375\n00:20:10.317 --> 00:20:14.680\nwhether you go out to tend the process or\nwhether you have preferred suppliers, etc.\n\n376\n00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:20.986\nWhat we can tell you is, what we deal\nwith is what's inside that dotted line.\n\n377\n00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:23.410\nSo we'll deal with the suppliers.\n\n378\n00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.177\nWe will manage the suppliers.\n\n379\n00:20:26.177 --> 00:20:32.750\nWe will not manage the relationship\ndirectly with the subcontracted suppliers.\n\n380\n00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.360\nThat is down to Supplier B\nin this particular diagram.\n\n381\n00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.463\nSupplier B manages\nthe subcontracted suppliers.\n\n382\n00:20:40.463 --> 00:20:42.220\nWe do not do that directly.\n\n383\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.660\nSo we will not be auditing that you have\na relationship with your subcontracted\n\n384\n00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.350\nsuppliers, because that's really\ndown to Supplier B to do that.\n\n385\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.460\nWhat we will check is that\nsomebody will take ownership for\n\n386\n00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.300\nsupplier management,\neither you have contracts in place or\n\n387\n00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.790\nthat you have service level\ntargets within those contracts.\n\n388\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.610\nYou may have penalties and incentives.\n\n389\n00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.130\nAll changes to the contract have to\ngo through change management, and\n\n390\n00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.630\nthere has to be a documented dispute\nprocedure as well for all contracts,\n\n391\n00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.090\nand where we have a situation where\nwe've got lead suppliers then we've got\n\n392\n00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:24.020\nsubcontractors, we've got to make sure\nthat the roles and responsibilities,\n\n393\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:29.280\nin other words, where the buck stops,\nas we like to say, is defined.\n\n394\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.037\nSo we want to ensure that the lead\nsuppliers manage their subcontractors, but\n\n395\n00:21:34.037 --> 00:21:36.425\nhow they do that is entirely up to them.\n\n396\n00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:40.981\nWe have to monitor performance against\nour contract, and against those service\n\n397\n00:21:40.981 --> 00:21:44.742\ntargets, and then we have to do\nsomething with that performance.\n\n398\n00:21:44.742 --> 00:21:47.510\nWe've got to review the results and\ndo something with it.\n\n399\n00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.690\nSo I wanna see evidence of that.\n\n400\n00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:54.750\nI also want to see evidence\nthat contracts are reviewed on\n\n401\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:00.490\na regular basis, and I will tell\nyou that any documentation really,\n\n402\n00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:05.180\nand it should, it should be reviewed,\nat least once a year, but we wanna see\n\n403\n00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:10.900\nevidence that reviews have taken place,\nand that's what we want to see.\n\n404\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.330\nWe want to see that reviews have happened.\n\n405\n00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.660\nWe need to see documentary evidence.\n\n406\n00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.080\nAs always, I'm always gonna say, show me.\n\n407\n00:22:22.018 --> 00:22:26.675\nSo now we've finished looking at\nour relationship processes, and\n\n408\n00:22:26.675 --> 00:22:32.328\nin our next episode, we are going to be\ntaking a look at our resolution processes.\n\n409\n00:22:32.328 --> 00:22:36.866\nBut for now, we would just like you\nto review on what we've covered so\n\n410\n00:22:36.866 --> 00:22:41.873\nfar and if you have any queries, obviously\nthen come back to us on the forum,\n\n411\n00:22:41.873 --> 00:22:46.445\nand we'll be happy to help wherever\nwe can, and we'll say goodbye.\n\n412\n00:22:46.445 --> 00:22:49.402\n&gt;&gt; All right, and don't forget\nto go ahead and use those stars.\n\n413\n00:22:49.402 --> 00:22:51.945\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But thank you so much for\n\n414\n00:22:51.945 --> 00:22:53.505\nbeing with us, and like Jo said,\n\n415\n00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:56.635\nstay tuned we've got clause 8 coming up,\nso you don't wanna miss that.\n\n416\n00:22:56.635 --> 00:22:58.966\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n417\n00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:00.426\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n418\n00:23:00.426 --> 00:23:01.668\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n419\n00:23:01.668 --> 00:23:03.590\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n420\n00:23:03.590 -->

00:00:08.364\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:12.196\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:18.105\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your ISO/IEC\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.500\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.642\nIn this episode we'll be taking\na look at clause eight and\n\n8\n00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.060\nspecifically will be talking\nabout a resolution processes.\n\n9\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.680\nBack in studios with us today we have\nISO expert Jo Peacock, hows it going Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.950\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great thank\nyou Cherokee how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm good and we're not having any\nkind of conflict resolution, but\n\n12\n00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.590\nif we were, then, would this be\nthe episode we would talk about that?\n\n13\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.130\n&gt;&gt; I think that there's a special couch\nwaiting for us to talk about that.\n\n14\n00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't think that we need to do it\n\n15\n00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.680\nlive on TV, but if you're insisting.\n\n16\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.300\nYeah we're talking about picking out\nthe pieces when something's gone wrong.\n\n17\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about.\n\n18\n00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.050\nWe're not talking about\ntoo much about conflict,\n\n19\n00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.320\nwe dealt with that in resolution.\n\n20\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.260\nWe're just talking about when something\ngoes wrong, well picking up the pieces and\n\n21\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.560\nalso trying to prevent\nit from happening again.\n\n22\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n23\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.770\n&gt;&gt; So here we are in our,\nwell, resolution processes.\n\n24\n00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.610\nAnd for those of you that\nare familiar with ITIL and\n\n25\n00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.570\nI'd imagine a lot of you are, you will\nnotice that my resolution processes,\n\n26\n00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.620\nthat's the yellow at the bottom there.\n\n27\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.350\nWe've got incident and\nservice request management.\n\n28\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.160\nNow that has been combined into\nwhat looks like one process.\n\n29\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.910\nAnd we've also got problem\nmanagement as well, don't be fooled\n\n30\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.340\nby the fact that things have been combined\ninto what looks like one process.\n\n31\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.620\nWe're talking here about\naudit requirements.\n\n32\n00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.560\nAnd we're talking about what\nwe are going to audit against,\n\n33\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.640\nwe're not necessarily talking\nabout separate processes.\n\n34\n00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.250\nThis is just this is how we audit,\nthat's all this is.\n\n35\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.940\nSo we've got some terms that\nI just need you to know.\n\n36\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.942\nAn incident is an unplanned interruption\nto or a reduction in the quality\n\n37\n00:01:58.942 --> 00:02:03.539\nof a service, or it's an event\nthat not yet impacted the service.\n\n38\n00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.333\nA service request is a request for\ninformation or access to a service or\n\n39\n00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.340\npre-approved change.\n\n40\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.852\nAnd I like to put that into\nthe category of can I have something or\n\n41\n00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:15.388\ncan you tell me something?\n\n42\n00:02:15.388 --> 00:02:20.431\nSo a problem is the unknown underlying\nroot cause of one or more incidents.\n\n43\n00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:25.742\nAnd a known error is a problem\nwhere we know the root cause but\n\n44\n00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:29.920\nwe have a work around to restore service.\n\n45\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.204\nSo a known error is a problem for\nwhich a root cause is known and\n\n46\n00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:35.803\na work around exists.\n\n47\n00:02:35.803 --> 00:02:41.093\nSo in terms of then the actual\naudit itself, ISO 20,000.\n\n48\n00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:42.380\nWhat are we auditing against?\n\n49\n00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.100\nWhat are we looking for\nin our resolution processes?\n\n50\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.360\nWell, here are our Part 1 Shalls for\n\n51\n00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.990\nincident management,\nservice request management.\n\n52\n00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.210\nAnd in incident service\nrequest management,\n\n53\n00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.090\nI am looking to see\ndocumented procedures for\n\n54\n00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.430\nall incidents, and for\nthe managing of all service requests.\n\n55\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.580\nI want to know what you're doing to\nmake sure that they are all logged.\n\n56\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.820\nAnd I want to make sure that all incidents\nand all service requests are logged and\n\n57\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.560\nthat they are all progressed.\n\n58\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.290\nSo I want to see evidence that you\nare setting priority for incidents and for\n\n59\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.879\nservice requests based on impact and\nurgency.\n\n60\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.700\nI want to see procedures for\nescalation of incidents.\n\n61\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.420\nI want to see that you have access\nto information for your analysts.\n\n62\n00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.140\nWhatever analysts,\nwhether they be service desk analysts, or\n\n63\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.130\nsuper users, or\nsecond level support analysts.\n\n64\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.820\nWhomever is performing incident and\nrequest management.\n\n65\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.230\nSo, I want to see evidence that they\ncan access the known error databases.\n\n66\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.090\nProblem resolutions, and\nyour configuration management database.\n\n67\n00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.460\nThat they can access releases,\nthey can access changes, so\n\n68\n00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.040\nthat that can help them\nwith incident resolution.\n\n69\n00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:07.515\nYou see, what we want to do, our intent\nhere and what we should be doing,\n\n70\n00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:11.505\nis to manage incidents and\nservice requests consistently.\n\n71\n00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:13.905\nTo ensure that incident resolution or\n\n72\n00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:18.965\nrequest fulfillment is achieved within\nthe agreed targets and time frames.\n\n73\n00:04:18.965 --> 00:04:24.440\nVery similar to previous episodes where\nwe've said that when it comes to targets,\n\n74\n00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.000\nwe can't put them in the shall because we\ndon't always achieve all of our targets.\n\n75\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.270\nSo this is just in an intent, this is\na should, we should receive all of that,\n\n76\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.380\nwe should achieve all of our targets.\n\n77\n00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.890\nBut as we know, the real world\ngets in the way sometimes and\n\n78\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.310\nwe can't always achieve\nall of our targets.\n\n79\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.620\nVery simply,\nI want an incident to look like this.\n\n80\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.500\nVery, very simply,\nwe log it in our core login system.\n\n81\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.730\nWe classify it, and\n\n82\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.800\nwe allocate a priority based on impact and\nurgency, and we might escalate.\n\n83\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.550\nAnd we can either escalate to\nmaybe a second level support team,\n\n84\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.110\na functional type escalation.\n\n85\n00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.410\nOr that we can escalate to management,\na hierarchical type escalation.\n\n86\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.600\nAnd then we will work on the incident.\n\n87\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.740\nEither we implement a workaround, or\nmaybe we actually do something else that\n\n88\n00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.860\nwill fix the incident, in other words,\nrestore service operation.\n\n89\n00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.480\nSo we resolve that, we confirm with\nthe user that it's been resolved and\n\n90\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.200\nwe close the incident.\n\n91\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.840\nAnd I wanna see evidence\nwhen we're auditing.\n\n92\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.190\nI want to see evidence\nof each one of these.\n\n93\n00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.580\nI want to see that each step has been\nfulfilled, this is what I want to see.\n\n94\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.280\nAnd as I said, we base priority on\nimpact and urgency, I want to see this.\n\n95\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.440\nNow, it doesn't mean that I want to see\nthis in our incident management core login\n\n96\n00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.932\nsystem, although I'd\nexpect it to be in there.\n\n97\n00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:54.446\nAnd I'd expect it to be managed\nby the core log in system but\n\n98\n00:05:54.446 --> 00:05:58.950\nI'd like to see this in maybe our\nservice level agreement document.\n\n99\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.420\nIt should be in there, we should\nunderstand what constitutes a priority one\n\n100\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.730\nand how quickly we're going to aim\nto resolve a priority one incident.\n\n101\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.490\nI want to see this in a service\nlevel agreement document.\n\n102\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.900\nI also want to see a method for\nhandling major incidents.\n\n103\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.040\nI want to see that we have a definition\nfor what constitutes a major incident, and\n\n104\n00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.410\nI want to see that this is\nagreed with the customer.\n\n105\n00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.717\nThat we've got a procedure,\nthat it is documented,\n\n106\n00:06:31.717 --> 00:06:35.905\nthat it's agreed with the customer,\nand that senior management or\n\n107\n00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:39.151\ntop management,\nas we call it in ISO 20,000.\n\n108\n00:06:39.151 --> 00:06:45.530\nWill allocate a defined individual to\nbe responsible for any major incident.\n\n109\n00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.420\nSo I want to know what the difference\nis between a priority one incident and\n\n110\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.110\na major incident.\n\n111\n00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.910\nI also wan to know at what point\nin time do we hand over a major\n\n112\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.370\nincident to service continuity.\n\n113\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.250\nAt what point in time do we start as\nwe called in a previous episode or\n\n114\n00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.960\nas Cherokee referred to it in\na previous episode, disaster recovery.\n\n115\n00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.340\nAt what point in time?\n\n116\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.599\nThere's an overlap there and\nI want to see those relationships.\n\n117\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.413\nI also want to see that after a major\nincident once service has been restored\n\n118\n00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:24.525\nthen I want to see that a review\nis conducted for a major incident.\n\n119\n00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:28.822\nSo I want to see not only evidence\nof the actual process itself, but\n\n120\n00:07:28.822 --> 00:07:34.136\nI also want to see evidence that reviews\nhave been happening for major incidents.\n\n121\n00:07:34.136 --> 00:07:37.560\nSo me show me,\nshow me that reviews have been happening.\n\n122\n00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.760\nWe have to think about,\n\n123\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.270\nI've just mentioned two relationships\nin the last couple of seconds.\n\n124\n00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.791\nI mentioned the relationship with service\nlevel management when we talked about\n\n125\n00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:50.796\nthe priorities.\n\n126\n00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:55.065\nI also mentioned\nthe relationship with service\n\n127\n00:07:55.065 --> 00:07:59.228\ncontinuity management\nwhen we talked about,\n\n128\n00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:04.149\nwhen does a major incident\nbecome a continuity issue.\n\n129\n00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:12.495\nThere are lots of examples of\nwhen processes work together.\n\n130\n00:08:12.495 --> 00:08:14.435\nAnd we want to see evidence\nof those examples,\n\n131\n00:08:14.435 --> 00:08:16.840\nwe want to see evidence of\nwhen processes work together.\n\n132\n00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.696\nLet me give you a very,\nvery brief example.\n\n133\n00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:22.260\nService level management,\nwithin service level management\n\n134\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.780\nwe define targets within our\nservice level agreements.\n\n135\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.710\nBut we also have hours of\noperation as well for a service.\n\n136\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.420\nNow you will notice in previous\nepisodes that the hours of operation\n\n137\n00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.950\nwere also displayed in\nthe catalog of services.\n\n138\n00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.690\nSo in our catalog we will see the service\ndescription that's come from service level\n\n139\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:50.240\nmanagement and the hours of operation,\nthat's come from service level management.\n\n140\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.800\nAnd also who the customer is.\n\n141\n00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.710\nThat's the person that's signed the SLA.\n\n142\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.450\nSo again,\nthat's come from service level management.\n\n143\n00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.510\nSo we'll see that, but\nthen all of those hours of operation and\n\n144\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.804\nthose targets will be fed\ninto incident management.\n\n145\n00:09:04.804 --> 00:09:07.250\nAnd incident management will\n\n146\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:12.160\nrestore service as per the targets\nthat are outlined in the SLA.\n\n147\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.690\nBut they will also, as per any targets\nthat maybe outlined in the SLA,\n\n148\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.330\nraise a problem to identify the root cause\nof an incident, should they need to.\n\n149\n00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.770\nAnd again, that problem will be progressed\nas per the targets outlined in the SLA.\n\n150\n00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.150\nWe may also need to raise\na change to resolve a problem.\n\n151\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:36.060\nAnd if we raise that request for change,\nagain, we'll be progressing that change\n\n152\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.330\nrecord through using targets\nthat are defined in the SLA.\n\n153\n00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.520\nSo here's a huge big chain of\ncommand as we might call it there.\n\n154\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.600\nThere's a huge big change,\nall of those relationships.\n\n155\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.400\nNow, I've already mentioned\na relationship between incident and\n\n156\n00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.290\nservice continuity management.\n\n157\n00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.970\nBut what about things like\navailability management,\n\n158\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.300\ncapacity management and\nproblem management?\n\n159\n00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.750\nProblem management, well,\nit's split into two.\n\n160\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.831\nIt's about responding to and\nfinding root causes for incidents.\n\n161\n00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:10.933\nIt's also about preventing\nincidents from happening.\n\n162\n00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:15.673\nIn which case, if we're preventing\nincidents from happening then we are doing\n\n163\n00:10:15.673 --> 00:10:20.627\na risk management and risk management also\nfalls into availability management and\n\n164\n00:10:20.627 --> 00:10:24.892\nservice continuity management and\ninto capacity management as well.\n\n165\n00:10:24.892 --> 00:10:31.051\nWhere we're identifying potential impacts\nof changes on capacity requirements and\n\n166\n00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:36.020\non availability requirements\nbecause they could cause incidents.\n\n167\n00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.308\nIn other words,\nthey could become problems.\n\n168\n00:10:38.308 --> 00:10:43.270\nLoss of relationships,\n\n169\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.730\nwhen you actually see a relationship\ndiagram full of the processes that\n\n170\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:53.140\nare within IT service management itself,\n\n171\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.820\nit kind of looks like a spider\nhas crawled across the page.\n\n172\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.880\nIt really does.\n\n173\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.300\nBecause there are relationships\nwith every single activity and\n\n174\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.750\nprocess that we do within\nIT service management.\n\n175\n00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.276\nWe wanna see evidence of those\nrelationships being documented.\n\n176\n00:11:09.276 --> 00:11:13.353\nAnd there are lots of useful information,\nwe call it, sort of,\n\n177\n00:11:13.353 --> 00:11:18.578\ncomplimentary guidance and we mentioned\nit in our introduction to ISO 2000.\n\n178\n00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:22.643\nThere's lots of information out there and\nlots of images and\n\n179\n00:11:22.643 --> 00:11:27.507\nlots of graphical representations out\nthere of all of the relationships\n\n180\n00:11:27.507 --> 00:11:31.029\nbetween processes within\nIT services management.\n\n181\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.705\nThey can help you by showing\nyou what we're looking for.\n\n182\n00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:39.470\nI can't provide you with the evidence,\nbut they can help\n\n183\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.820\nyou by showing you what you're\nlooking for, and certainly your tools.\n\n184\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.390\nYour workflow process engines,\nas we like to call it.\n\n185\n00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.890\nI think you called it a ticketing system,\ndidn't you, in one previous episode?\n\n186\n00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:49.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did.\n\n187\n00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we like to call that\na workflow process engine.\n\n188\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n189\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one extreme to\nthe other that is, isn't it?\n\n190\n00:11:55.045 --> 00:11:57.681\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, mine is totally informal,\n\n191\n00:11:57.681 --> 00:11:59.430\nthat's the correct terminology.\n\n192\n00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:04.487\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that will sort of provide you\nwith a lot of help certainly in terms\n\n193\n00:12:04.487 --> 00:12:09.568\nof evidence, in terms of being able\nto articulate the relationships.\n\n194\n00:12:09.568 --> 00:12:13.840\nCuz quite often it's difficult to say,\nwell look, this is definitely happening.\n\n195\n00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.230\nAnd of course, what we want to see,\n\n196\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.770\nis we want to see evidence that\nthese relationships are in place.\n\n197\n00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.500\nAnd so, you can't just print\noff a relationship diagram.\n\n198\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.610\nAnd even then a relationship diagram\ndoesn't prove that the relationships\n\n199\n00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.678\nare in place, it's just a demonstration\nof what relationships should look like.\n\n200\n00:12:29.678 --> 00:12:34.400\nSo yes, you use your tool,\nyour tool will help you with this.\n\n201\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.790\nBut also use information that is\navailable out there in the big,\n\n202\n00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.170\nwide world, on that big,\nwide web as it were.\n\n203\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.660\nThat will help you certainly,\nso let's look at problem\n\n204\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.105\nmanagement because we've already spoken\na little bit about problem management.\n\n205\n00:12:49.105 --> 00:12:52.130\nProblem management well,\ntheir role, obviously,\n\n206\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.960\nis to identifying then the root causes.\n\n207\n00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.530\nSo we're identifying problems here and\nwe're avoiding the impact of incidence.\n\n208\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.760\nSo we're trying to prevent incidence.\n\n209\n00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.960\nSo, again, I want to see evidence\nthat we're recording problems.\n\n210\n00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.110\nThat we're given problems,\npriorities, escalation,\n\n211\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.230\nthat we have escalation procedures\nin place they'e being updated.\n\n212\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:17.860\nThat we're raising an RFC, a request for\nchange, if we need to raise a change.\n\n213\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.239\nAnd that we are subject to\ncontinual improvement for\n\n214\n00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:25.135\nour problem management process.\n\n215\n00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:29.693\nThe intent is that we identify the unknown\nunderlying root cause of one or\n\n216\n00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:30.823\nmore incidents.\n\n217\n00:13:30.823 --> 00:13:34.812\nAnd that we actually are able\nto affect resolutions\n\n218\n00:13:34.812 --> 00:13:39.300\nto those root causes through\nchange management, okay.\n\n219\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.770\nBut proactively, we also have to\nprevent incidents from occurring.\n\n220\n00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.480\nNow again, we're not going to do\nthis in every single incidence.\n\n221\n00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.360\nSo what I'm expecting is I'm expecting\nto see evidence in the Shall.\n\n222\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.530\nI'm expecting to see evidence\nwhere we can analyze information.\n\n223\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:01.290\nI'm expecting to see evidence where\nwe have identified root causes.\n\n224\n00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:06.350\nAnd where we've made decisions on\nthe fact that we are not resolving.\n\n225\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.510\nSometimes we don't always want to\nresolve a problem, and that's okay.\n\n226\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.380\nWe may choose that we don't wanna resolve\na problem because maybe it costs too much.\n\n227\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.080\nOr maybe that service is about to be\nretired, or maybe it's a strategic or\n\n228\n00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.340\na business decision not to\nresolve that particular problem.\n\n229\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.100\nThat's okay, but we need to see\nevidence of when that is documented.\n\n230\n00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.080\nAnd, also, we need to see evidence of\nthe fact that a decision was made and\n\n231\n00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.120\nit was an informed decision.\n\n232\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.320\nSo we need to see evidence of\nguidance on that decision, as well,\n\n233\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.630\nand not just the fact that we\njust closed the problem record.\n\n234\n00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.450\nObviously, you don't\njust want to see that,\n\n235\n00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.200\nwe also want to see\nthe problem management.\n\n236\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.470\nThey are responsible for\nthe known error databases, so\n\n237\n00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:55.560\nwe want to see that known\nerror databases are in use.\n\n238\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.830\nAnd that we're providing\ninformation on known errors\n\n239\n00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:04.080\nto both the incident management\nprocess and service request process.\n\n240\n00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.360\nSo I want to see evidence of those known\nerrors and that known error database.\n\n241\n00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.900\nAnd I'm always going to ask the question,\nshow me, show me that evidence.\n\n242\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.830\nSo at this point in time now,\n\n243\n00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.500\nwe've actually completed\nour resolution processes.\n\n244\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.390\nAnd when we come back,\nin our next episode,\n\n245\n00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.230\nwe're going to take a look at clause nine,\nwhich are our control processes.\n\n246\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.080\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you for your\ntime, and thank you for your time as well.\n\n247\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.050\nBut stay tuned we have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n248\n00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.190\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n249\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.640\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n250\n00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.415\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.200\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.121\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be taking a look at Clause 9,\n\n8\n00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:25.225\nspecifically controlled processes.\n\n9\n00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.920\nAnd who better to explain that\ntopic than ISO expert, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.010\nThanks for joining us today, Jo.\n\n11\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.408\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:32.408 --> 00:00:35.690\nI can think of plenty of people better\nto explain to be perfectly honest.\n\n13\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, that's not true.\n\n14\n00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:39.136\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How are you this morning,\nanyway?\n\n15\n00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.461\n&gt;&gt; I'm good thank you for asking.\n\n16\n00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:42.689\nSo we've been moving right along here,\n\n17\n00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:46.693\nlooking at our different clauses when\nwe talk about control processes.\n\n18\n00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:48.388\nWhat are we looking at here, Jo?\n\n19\n00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:50.235\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nwell we're looking at specifically.\n\n20\n00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:53.499\nWe're looking at change management,\nwe're looking at release and\n\n21\n00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.168\ndeployment management, and\nwe're looking at configuration management.\n\n22\n00:00:57.168 --> 00:01:01.453\nBecause these processes, if we take a look\nat our service management system diagram,\n\n23\n00:01:01.453 --> 00:01:04.345\nyou'll see that these processes\nsit right in the middle.\n\n24\n00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:09.415\nThese are our control processes, and we\ncall them our control processes because,\n\n25\n00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:14.250\nthese processes obviously have\nrelationships to every other process.\n\n26\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.400\nThese processes affect every other\nprocess and these processes, well,\n\n27\n00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.500\ncertainly when we look at\nconfiguration management for instance.\n\n28\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.905\nConfiguration management has the\nfoundation for all of the other processes\n\n29\n00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:32.910\ncuz configuration management stores all of\nour information about all of our services.\n\n30\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.229\nNow one of the things that you'll need\nto do is to be able to demonstrate\n\n31\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.940\nat audit level that you have relationships\nin place between your processes.\n\n32\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.550\nAnd so configuration management is a very,\n\n33\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.870\nvery important process to demonstrate\nthose relationships through.\n\n34\n00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:54.485\nOne thing that I would recommend when\nwe're talking about relationships is that\n\n35\n00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:59.271\nwe or you, [LAUGH] Not we,\nyou compile a relationship diagram that\n\n36\n00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:02.884\nwill certainly help you to\narticulate the relationships.\n\n37\n00:02:02.884 --> 00:02:06.285\nAnd by that, the easiest way to do this.\n\n38\n00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:09.673\nAnd I say the easiest way because I've\nshown Cherokee an example of some\n\n39\n00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:13.190\nrelationship diagrams and\nthey didn't look anything but easy, right?\n\n40\n00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.599\n&gt;&gt; As long as I'm not sitting over here\nwith like some crayons and stash paper.\n\n41\n00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.440\nI think we'll be okay, but\nyeah what's the recommendation?\n\n42\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.099\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean the last time I did a\nrelationship diagram which was a few weeks\n\n43\n00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.430\nago by the client.\n\n44\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.300\nWe ended up using seven white\nboards just the seven as so-\n\n45\n00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.072\n&gt;&gt; There was a lot of information Jo.\n\n46\n00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:35.289\n&gt;&gt; There was a lot of information\nthere you're right and so\n\n47\n00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.986\nwhat I would recommend for\nyou is that for every single process,\n\n48\n00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:41.905\nyou detail the outputs for\nevery single process.\n\n49\n00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:48.039\nSo, an output obviously is something\ntangible, what comes out of that process.\n\n50\n00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:51.986\nSo for instance if we're talking\nabout design and transition,\n\n51\n00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:55.910\nthen we would look for\na design plan, a design package.\n\n52\n00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.990\nNow we detail that design package and\nthen what you need to do is, for\n\n53\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.998\nthat one output, alone look at all\nof the inputs into that output.\n\n54\n00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:10.488\nSo look at everything that\ncontributes to that design package.\n\n55\n00:03:10.488 --> 00:03:14.219\nWell, when you think about this,\neverything that contributes includes your\n\n56\n00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.188\nservice level targets, your hours of\noperation, your service level agreement.\n\n57\n00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:24.524\nAll of your business requirements,\nyour project plans, your timescales,\n\n58\n00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:29.504\nyour vacation or holiday schedules,\nyour training needs.\n\n59\n00:03:29.504 --> 00:03:34.405\nWhen you think about it, the inputs\ninto the service design package,\n\n60\n00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:37.656\nwell inputs could be 100, 200 inputs.\n\n61\n00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:40.620\nAnd then think about where\nthose inputs come from.\n\n62\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.743\nAnd then you also then need\nto think about, right, okay.\n\n63\n00:03:43.743 --> 00:03:46.760\nWell what's included in\nthe service design package?\n\n64\n00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.570\nIn other words, what do you present\nfrom the service design package and\n\n65\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.750\nwho uses that?\n\n66\n00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.465\nSo that would be our outputs or\n\n67\n00:03:55.465 --> 00:04:00.796\nour relationship from that output,\nthe design package.\n\n68\n00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:03.190\nSo who uses that design package?\n\n69\n00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.760\nWell, the design package is\nused by change management.\n\n70\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.941\nIt's used by release and deployment\nmanagement, and they use certain elements.\n\n71\n00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:14.324\nSo we've just looked at one specific\noutput there, and I have already mentioned\n\n72\n00:04:14.324 --> 00:04:18.460\nprobably about 20 different relationships\njust in the last few seconds.\n\n73\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.861\nSo like I said, last time I did a full\nservice management relationship diagram\n\n74\n00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:29.971\nwith somebody within their organization,\nwe used up seven whiteboards.\n\n75\n00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:34.535\nAnd I did actually take photos of them\nbecause we all have cell phones now and\n\n76\n00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:35.920\nI took photos of them.\n\n77\n00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.723\nAnd I was showing them to Cherokee\njust before this session actually.\n\n78\n00:04:40.723 --> 00:04:43.010\nAnd it looked like a spider crawled\nacross the board, didn't it?\n\n79\n00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.232\n&gt;&gt; It did, but\nyou did have some color coding so\n\n80\n00:04:45.232 --> 00:04:47.164\nthat made it easier to understand so.\n\n81\n00:04:47.164 --> 00:04:47.735\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n82\n00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:50.696\nI mean you know you could put\ncolor coding in there etc.\n\n83\n00:04:50.696 --> 00:04:54.657\nBut one thing that you have to do,\nis you have to be able to articulate and\n\n84\n00:04:54.657 --> 00:04:58.102\ndemonstrate to the auditor that\nthese relationships exist.\n\n85\n00:04:58.102 --> 00:05:01.582\nAnd that you understand that\nthese relationships exist.\n\n86\n00:05:01.582 --> 00:05:06.468\nSo when you're pulling together,\nfor example, a design package,\n\n87\n00:05:06.468 --> 00:05:10.765\nthen I want to see exactly what\nmake up that design package and\n\n88\n00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:14.148\nexactly where those\nelements are coming from.\n\n89\n00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:19.320\nSo I want to see that maybe the vacation\nschedule is coming from HR and\n\n90\n00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.600\nI actually want to see that relationship.\n\n91\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.549\nI want to see evidence\nof that relationship.\n\n92\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.757\nI want to see that the Gantt chart or\n\n93\n00:05:28.757 --> 00:05:32.908\nthe timeline is coming directly\nfrom project management.\n\n94\n00:05:32.908 --> 00:05:37.166\nAnd I want to see that relationship, so\nI want to see the output, and I want\n\n95\n00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:41.997\nto see where that relationship's coming\nfrom, so I need to see that articulated.\n\n96\n00:05:41.997 --> 00:05:46.460\nThat has to be demonstrated,\nthese relationships are very important.\n\n97\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.494\nAnd a lot of relationships will come\nthrough configuration management they'll\n\n98\n00:05:50.494 --> 00:05:52.399\ncome through our control processes.\n\n99\n00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:57.240\nAnd we call them control processes because\nthey do control all of the relationships.\n\n100\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.116\nAnd they control service management You\nsee, configuration management, well,\n\n101\n00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:06.715\nconfiguration management contains\nthe configuration management system and\n\n102\n00:06:06.715 --> 00:06:09.092\nconfiguration management databases.\n\n103\n00:06:09.092 --> 00:06:12.280\nWhich contain all of our\nconfiguration items.\n\n104\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.087\nAnd change management controls\nwhat's updated in that configuration\n\n105\n00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:18.533\nmanagement system.\n\n106\n00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:23.306\nNow don't forget what I've said in all\nof our previous episodes about show me,\n\n107\n00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:26.730\nI want you to show me\nthe evidence of all of these.\n\n108\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.040\nAnd of course without\nconfiguration management,\n\n109\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.125\nwell incident management is\ngoing to be very difficult.\n\n110\n00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.190\nService level management is\ngoing to be very difficult.\n\n111\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.120\nBecause let's face it, how do I know\nif a service has been interrupted\n\n112\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.840\nif I don't know what\nmakes up that service?\n\n113\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.970\nHow can I get to the root\ncause of interruption and\n\n114\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.360\nin problem management if I don't know what\ncomponents there are within that service?\n\n115\n00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.017\nSo, configuration management, well that\nis our foundation, that's our basis for\n\n116\n00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:03.344\nservice management, because we're managing\nservices in service management and\n\n117\n00:07:03.344 --> 00:07:07.833\nconfiguration management tells us,\nwhat the services consist of and\n\n118\n00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:11.199\nalso what components of\nthese services are shared.\n\n119\n00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:16.244\nBecause we don't have one laptop for\none service and another laptop for another\n\n120\n00:07:16.244 --> 00:07:21.605\nservice and another laptop for another\nservice, all of our components are shared.\n\n121\n00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:26.195\nSo, of course somebody somewhere\nhas to keep the information on\n\n122\n00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:30.910\nall of those components and\nwho's using those components.\n\n123\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.276\nAnd that's what configuration\nmanagement does.\n\n124\n00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:37.983\nSo let's take a look at just some of\nthe key terms that we have here within our\n\n125\n00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:39.715\ncontrol processes.\n\n126\n00:07:39.715 --> 00:07:44.310\nWe have configuration item,\nand a configuration item is\n\n127\n00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:50.100\nan item of the configuration of our\nservice, or a component of our service.\n\n128\n00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.592\nAnd we store information, data about\nthose configuration items, in our CMDB,\n\n129\n00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:57.116\nin our Configuration Management Database.\n\n130\n00:07:57.116 --> 00:08:01.234\nAnd we may have multiple\ndatabases that make up our\n\n131\n00:08:01.234 --> 00:08:04.284\nconfiguration management system.\n\n132\n00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:09.184\nNow within our configuration management\ndatabase we need to store not\n\n133\n00:08:09.184 --> 00:08:12.838\nonly the data about that\nparticular component, but\n\n134\n00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:17.220\nalso the attributes about\nthose components as well.\n\n135\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.000\nSo attributes will consist\nof the unique identifier.\n\n136\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.180\nYou know,\n\n137\n00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:28.450\nwe give every single laptop, well I hope\nwe give it an asset number, for instance.\n\n138\n00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.120\nWe give every single server\nrack an asset number.\n\n139\n00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.530\nEvery single cable is given a port number.\n\n140\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.160\nI should hope it's given a port number.\n\n141\n00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:43.970\nSo we'll give all of our assets an asset\nnumber including our software as well.\n\n142\n00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.720\nEverything's given an asset\nnumber apart from people.\n\n143\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.980\nAnd of course people well we\ngive them a user ID don't we?\n\n144\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.710\nThat's their unique identifier to IT.\n\n145\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.740\nSo remember, every single component,\nand I don't know Cherokee.\n\n146\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.910\nCan you remember the types\nof components that we had?\n\n147\n00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.030\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n[LAUGH]\n\n148\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n149\n00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.180\n&gt;&gt; Now, this is putting her on the spot.\n\n150\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.480\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo we had the net, well,\n\n151\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.370\nthe infrastructure.\n\n152\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:11.920\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n153\n00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.590\nYeah.\n\n154\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:16.480\n&gt;&gt; We had employees or humans,\nI don't know exactly the term.\n\n155\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.360\n&gt;&gt; People, yeah?\n\n156\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.130\n&gt;&gt; People, okay, hardware?\n\n157\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.720\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And-\n\n158\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:25.965\n&gt;&gt; If you've got hardware, you gotta have?\n\n159\n00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Software, no.\n\n160\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n161\n00:09:27.755 --> 00:09:29.392\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I remembered that one.\n\n162\n00:09:29.392 --> 00:09:32.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You've also gotta have\nsomething else if you've got hardware.\n\n163\n00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.900\nSomething that actually,\nshe doesn't have right now.\n\n164\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.410\nUtilities, power.\n\n165\n00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.080\n&gt;&gt; Power.\n\n166\n00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.720\nRight, okay that's our environment.\n\n167\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.390\n&gt;&gt; If you guys are like what it's\nbecause I don't have my charger on\n\n168\n00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:43.930\nmy laptop right now.\n\n169\n00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.235\n&gt;&gt; She's forgotten her power supply,\nthat's what I mean.\n\n170\n00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:49.800\n[LAUGH] And we have to have contracts and\nagreements in place to grow.\n\n171\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.390\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's what I was\nthinking about was like the policies that\n\n172\n00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.340\nwe've\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] documentation.\n\n173\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Right yes, I'm impressed.\n\n174\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.060\nI am so impressed.\n\n175\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:02.360\nShe has been listening\nit's amazing [LAUGH].\n\n176\n00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.690\nI'm incredibly impressed.\n\n177\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.758\nI wonder if you could\nhave got that that quick.\n\n178\n00:10:05.758 --> 00:10:06.803\n&gt;&gt; Quickly.\n\n179\n00:10:06.803 --> 00:10:11.790\n[LAUGH] So, all of the information about\nthe components then of our services\n\n180\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.650\nare stored in our configuration\nmanagement database.\n\n181\n00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.440\nAnd they're all what we consider\nto be a configuration item.\n\n182\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.870\nAnd what we will do,\non a regular basis, before any change,\n\n183\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.630\nbefore we make a change to any of our\nenvironment, any component at all,\n\n184\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.590\nwe will take a base line.\n\n185\n00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.220\nA base line is just a snap\nshot of where we are now.\n\n186\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.150\nWe take a base line.\n\n187\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.900\nWe'll take a photograph, let's say for\ninstance, before we make a change.\n\n188\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.260\nAnd then we raise the request for\nchange and\n\n189\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.580\nthe change is approved it will go into\nthat a little bit more detail in a moment.\n\n190\n00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.830\nAnd then the changes implemented and\n\n191\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:57.980\nthen we take another baseline another\nsnapshot of where we are now.\n\n192\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:03.520\nSo that we can compare the two It's a bit\nsimilar to when you remodel your house,\n\n193\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.350\nfor instance.\n\n194\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.720\nYou'll take a photograph\nbefore you do something, and\n\n195\n00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.600\nthen you take another photo afterwards.\n\n196\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.910\nAnd you say, hey,\nlook at the big change we've made.\n\n197\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.060\nOr in my case, generally, you take\na photograph afterwards, and then you say,\n\n198\n00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.585\ncan you remember what it looked\nlike before, because I can't.\n\n199\n00:11:17.585 --> 00:11:20.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I always forget the first one.\n\n200\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I'm always like,\nlet's do this health challenge,\n\n201\n00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.150\nI'll take them before and after.\n\n202\n00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:30.712\nBut then the after never really,\nyou're like, what did I just do?\n\n203\n00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:32.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n204\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.880\nI wouldn't do that with\nthe health challenge,\n\n205\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.980\ncuz I'd just end up with lots of befores.\n\n206\n00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.600\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; That's all that would happen.\n\n207\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.450\nBut that's what our baseline is.\n\n208\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.620\nIt's a before and after.\n\n209\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.490\nThis is one This is what\nit looked it before.\n\n210\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.250\nAnd this is what happened afterwards.\n\n211\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.800\nAnd the reason why we do that\nis because we want to capture\n\n212\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.470\nany unexpected outcomes.\n\n213\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.720\nIn our RFC, in our request for\nchange, which is that\n\n214\n00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.280\nsimple that record where we make\nthat request to make change.\n\n215\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.740\nWell we should include all of\nthe expected outcomes in there.\n\n216\n00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.940\nThis is what we expect will change.\n\n217\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.750\nThis is what we're planning to change.\n\n218\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.097\nThe unfortunate thing is sometimes\nother things change as well [LAUGH].\n\n219\n00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.820\nIdentify these and say okay,\n\n220\n00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.950\nright we know that this is changed\nwe've got to do something about it.\n\n221\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.520\nThis is when our remedial\naction comes into play.\n\n222\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.040\nAnd of course, don't forget I wanna\nsee evidence in our audit and\n\n223\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.270\nwe're in audit now, I wanna see\nevidence that you have remedial action\n\n224\n00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.170\nthat is required for every single RFC.\n\n225\n00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.660\nAnd so this is when we use\nthat baseline to say okay\n\n226\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.240\nwe need to take some remedial action,\nbecause something else has changed.\n\n227\n00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.360\nIt's affected something else.\n\n228\n00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.280\nDid you have something that\nyou wanted to say then?\n\n229\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.940\n&gt;&gt; Well when you're just talking\nabout those configuration baselines,\n\n230\n00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.800\nthis is something that.\n\n231\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.960\nI'm not gonna assume that\neveryone watching this,\n\n232\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.980\nthat it's ingrained into their habits.\n\n233\n00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.600\nBut most, I would say,\neffective IT personnel,\n\n234\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.790\nthis is just something that's part\nof your normal day to day function.\n\n235\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.410\nEven not just configuration baselines,\nbut we have performance baselines.\n\n236\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.180\nThis is gonna be a I huge when it comes\ntantamount as far as measurement and\n\n237\n00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.020\nusing this as a tool.\n\n238\n00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.822\n&gt;&gt; It is, and you'd be surprised\nhow many people don't do it.\n\n239\n00:13:33.822 --> 00:13:38.380\nAnd in the same way, and I use\nthe example of remodeling your house and\n\n240\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.480\nmaking changes to your house because in\nexactly that same way that we tend to just\n\n241\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.440\nget on and do it and we say you know what\nI'm going to repaint the living room and\n\n242\n00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.880\nwe'll do things like that.\n\n243\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.010\nAnd then it's only after you've done it,\n\n244\n00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.215\nor maybe it's when\nyou're half way through.\n\n245\n00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:56.200\n[LAUGH] And you suddenly think to\nyourself I can't remember what it\n\n246\n00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.510\nlooked like beforehand.\n\n247\n00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.920\nAnd we do that in IT as well and\n\n248\n00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.515\neven though you say yes,\nwe take baseline, we don't.\n\n249\n00:14:04.515 --> 00:14:05.595\nAnd that's the problem.\n\n250\n00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.225\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Is that we don't.\n\n251\n00:14:07.225 --> 00:14:08.855\nAnd if we don't take a baseline,\n\n252\n00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:12.865\nthen that first baseline that we\ntake becomes our starting point.\n\n253\n00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:13.885\nSo imagine this.\n\n254\n00:14:13.885 --> 00:14:16.905\nYou're in the middle of\npainting your living room.\n\n255\n00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:18.855\nAnd you've got halfway through.\n\n256\n00:14:18.855 --> 00:14:22.395\nAnd you suddenly think, I don't\nremember what it looked like before.\n\n257\n00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:23.415\nHas it changed any?\n\n258\n00:14:23.415 --> 00:14:25.460\nHow much progress have I made?\n\n259\n00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.460\nAnd you don't know.\n\n260\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.750\nSo, you take a picture but\nthat becomes your first baseline.\n\n261\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.030\nSo, you have to almost disregard\neverything that happened before.\n\n262\n00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.560\nThat's a dangerous thing when it\ncomes to IT, especially in changes\n\n263\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.075\nbecause what if you do need to go back,\nif you need to revert back.\n\n264\n00:14:41.075 --> 00:14:44.565\nBecause remedial action could be\nsomething like do nothing, but\n\n265\n00:14:44.565 --> 00:14:46.765\nit could be something like revert back.\n\n266\n00:14:46.765 --> 00:14:48.055\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you need to revert back,\n\n267\n00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:50.025\nif you don't know what you're\nreverting back too, and\n\n268\n00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:52.980\nyou're in a very dangerous place.\n\n269\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.410\nBaselines can be taken automatically and\nso in order to we are looking for,\n\n270\n00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.370\nwe are not looking for everything to\nbe automated but we are looking for\n\n271\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.520\neverything to be as efficient as possible,\nso if the baseline is taken automatically,\n\n272\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.830\nthen that's okay.\n\n273\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.580\nIf you automatically and\nsome organisation do,\n\n274\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.760\ntake the baseline of our infrastructure.\n\n275\n00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.910\nMaybe at pertinent points\nthroughout the day.\n\n276\n00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:20.350\nMaybe, you know, every hour we'll take\na baseline, maybe we do it once a day.\n\n277\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.140\nBecause obviously its going\nto take up bandwidth.\n\n278\n00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.520\nIt means getting out onto our network and\ndetecting exactly what is on there.\n\n279\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.720\nAnd even then you have to think about\nthe level of baseline you have to take.\n\n280\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.500\nWhat about, do we allow,\ndo we lock down our laptops?\n\n281\n00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.263\nIn which case the level of baseline\nis going to be a lot narrower,\n\n282\n00:15:40.263 --> 00:15:45.076\nthe scope is going to be narrower then\nthose organizations that encourage \"bring\n\n283\n00:15:45.076 --> 00:15:49.819\nyour own device\" for instance, where\neverybody can bring their own devices and\n\n284\n00:15:49.819 --> 00:15:51.869\nmake whatever changes they want.\n\n285\n00:15:51.869 --> 00:15:54.615\nYou still have to make sure\nthat if it's on your network,\n\n286\n00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:58.641\nthat it's going to have the right virus\nprotection and that it's going to be safe.\n\n287\n00:15:58.641 --> 00:15:59.896\nTo put onto the network and\n\n288\n00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:03.530\nthat there's nothing gonna get\nout to all of the other devices.\n\n289\n00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.141\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n290\n00:16:04.141 --> 00:16:11.080\n&gt;&gt; So of course, we have to consider\nour infrastructure, and our own ethics.\n\n291\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.090\nThis is where the service\nmanagement system and\n\n292\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.750\nthe policies really come into play.\n\n293\n00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.170\nSo, when you're audited,\n\n294\n00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:22.860\nthe auditor isn't, they're not going\nto just look for certain criteria.\n\n295\n00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:27.199\nThey're going to look for the criteria\nthat makes sense in your organization.\n\n296\n00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:31.593\nSo if I'm looking to see that\nbaselines are taken before any change,\n\n297\n00:16:31.593 --> 00:16:35.078\nthen I'm also going to look\nat your organization, and\n\n298\n00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:38.361\nI'm going to say,\nwhat organization do you have?\n\n299\n00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:42.700\nDo you have an organization where\neverybody brings their own device?\n\n300\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.818\nThat's great, but\n\n301\n00:16:43.818 --> 00:16:49.010\nI want the baseline then to encompass\neverything that's on everybody's device.\n\n302\n00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:53.340\nBecause, something could change\non somebody's else's device,\n\n303\n00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.350\nthat we can't do anything about.\n\n304\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.110\nCould you imagine,\n\n305\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.120\nwe're in a position right now where we are\nin a bring your own device environment?\n\n306\n00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:06.970\nSo let's just say that I went home this\nevening, or at the end of this session.\n\n307\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.850\nI went home, and I made some changes\nto my laptop, and I brought it in.\n\n308\n00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:15.080\nAnd I, of course, soon as I walked through\nthe door, it attaches to the network.\n\n309\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.700\nAnd all of a sudden, it changes everybody\nelse's laptop, and it makes changes.\n\n310\n00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.328\nMaybe I was doing something wrong,\n\n311\n00:17:21.328 --> 00:17:25.538\nmaybe I was creating a virus last night,\ncuz I got bored.\n\n312\n00:17:25.538 --> 00:17:27.972\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nthat's what you were doing, Jo, right?\n\n313\n00:17:27.972 --> 00:17:29.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, exactly.\n\n314\n00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.010\nAnd then I turn my laptop on, and\nit distributes a virus to everybody.\n\n315\n00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:39.860\nNow, if we don't have a baseline\nof everybody's laptop, then whose\n\n316\n00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:46.880\nresponsibility is it then to\nrevert back to previous versions?\n\n317\n00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.931\nWhose responsibility is\nit to take the backups?\n\n318\n00:17:49.931 --> 00:17:52.043\nYou see,\nthis is what happens in our policy,\n\n319\n00:17:52.043 --> 00:17:56.020\nbecause this is where we start\ntalking about our relationships.\n\n320\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.497\nWhose responsibility is it to take\nbackups for every single device?\n\n321\n00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:01.170\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n322\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.057\nhere at ITPROTV, that's gonna be us\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n323\n00:18:05.057 --> 00:18:07.749\nbecause we're in a bring\nyour own device environment.\n\n324\n00:18:07.749 --> 00:18:12.690\nAnd therefore, it's our responsibility\nto take our own backups, and\n\n325\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.256\nif we don't, then there's a risk.\n\n326\n00:18:15.256 --> 00:18:17.990\nBecause everybody is\ntaking their devices home,\n\n327\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.057\nthey're doing whatever they\nneed to on their devices.\n\n328\n00:18:21.057 --> 00:18:25.478\nThey're bringing them in, they could\nhave rebuilt that device last night.\n\n329\n00:18:25.478 --> 00:18:31.045\nYeah, so this is why we've got to\nmake sure that if I'm coming in and\n\n330\n00:18:31.045 --> 00:18:33.886\nI'm doing an assessment for you.\n\n331\n00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:38.887\nAnd I say that you're in a bring your own\ndevice environment, then obviously, I'm\n\n332\n00:18:38.887 --> 00:18:43.762\ngonna expect your baseline to encompass\nabsolutely everything that it needs to.\n\n333\n00:18:43.762 --> 00:18:50.161\nIt can't be to high level,\nbecause what if we need to revert back?\n\n334\n00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:54.644\nOr what if Cherokee's made a change on her\nlaptop that she didn't realize was going\n\n335\n00:18:54.644 --> 00:18:56.064\nto have any impact at all.\n\n336\n00:18:56.064 --> 00:18:58.563\nThen it's actually wiped out\neverybody else's hard drive.\n\n337\n00:18:58.563 --> 00:19:00.985\nIt's not a virus,\nit's just a change that she's made and\n\n338\n00:19:00.985 --> 00:19:02.826\nit wipes out everybody else's hard drive.\n\n339\n00:19:02.826 --> 00:19:04.144\nBut what do we do about that?\n\n340\n00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:07.064\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be looking for\nCherokee, first of all [LAUGH].\n\n341\n00:19:07.064 --> 00:19:08.786\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe wouldn't necessarily know it was you,\n\n342\n00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:10.757\nbecause if you were effected as well,\nhow would we know?\n\n343\n00:19:10.757 --> 00:19:11.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true, yeah.\n\n344\n00:19:11.446 --> 00:19:12.341\n&gt;&gt; How would we find out?\n\n345\n00:19:12.341 --> 00:19:14.316\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now I know that that's\n\n346\n00:19:14.316 --> 00:19:18.240\nproblem resolution, but yet\nagain, you see that baseline.\n\n347\n00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:24.011\nWell, that baseline is what's going to\ntell us exactly how things were before.\n\n348\n00:19:24.011 --> 00:19:25.691\nIt will allow us to revert back,\n\n349\n00:19:25.691 --> 00:19:29.330\nbut it also means that change\nmanagement isn't being followed.\n\n350\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.612\nBecause Cherokee's making changes\nwithout any formal change management.\n\n351\n00:19:35.604 --> 00:19:38.566\nIn our next slide,\nwe look at just the example of\n\n352\n00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:43.750\nthe relationship between change\nmanagement and configuration management.\n\n353\n00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.836\nNow, for all of you that have, and\n\n354\n00:19:46.836 --> 00:19:51.855\nI hope everybody has,\ncompleted the ITIL Foundation.\n\n355\n00:19:51.855 --> 00:19:53.751\nYou will have seen this diagram before,\n\n356\n00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:56.610\nbecause this diagram came\nstraight out of ITIL Foundation.\n\n357\n00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:02.175\nAnd this diagram looks at the relationship\nbetween changing configuration management.\n\n358\n00:20:02.175 --> 00:20:06.783\nAnd right away across the top,\nyou have the change or\n\n359\n00:20:06.783 --> 00:20:09.621\nan example of a change process.\n\n360\n00:20:09.621 --> 00:20:12.613\nBut at every single step\nduring the change process,\n\n361\n00:20:12.613 --> 00:20:17.272\nat every single step when we raise\nthe RFC, and when we assess the change.\n\n362\n00:20:17.272 --> 00:20:25.114\nWe have a link into a relationship with\nconfiguration management at the bottom.\n\n363\n00:20:25.114 --> 00:20:27.713\nSo for instance,\nas we're authorizing the change,\n\n364\n00:20:27.713 --> 00:20:29.920\nthen we're updating\nthe records in our CMS.\n\n365\n00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.306\nAnd that configuration\nmanagement system to say,\n\n366\n00:20:33.306 --> 00:20:38.040\nyes, this particular CI,\nconfiguration item is going to be changed.\n\n367\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.220\nAnd of course, right along the bottom\nthere, you've got our CMDBs,\n\n368\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.850\nour Configuration Management Database or\nDatabases,\n\n369\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.540\nwhich make up our configuration\nmanagement system.\n\n370\n00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.180\nSo we have this relationship in place.\n\n371\n00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.650\nNow, this is just a relationship\nbetween two processes, and\n\n372\n00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.850\nthis is quite a simple diagram.\n\n373\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.704\nBut I expect you to be able to\ndemonstrate the relationship between all\n\n374\n00:21:02.704 --> 00:21:04.108\nof your processes.\n\n375\n00:21:04.108 --> 00:21:07.790\nThat's what I expect,\nthat's what I want to see.\n\n376\n00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:12.186\nSo when it comes to\nconfiguration management, well,\n\n377\n00:21:12.186 --> 00:21:14.676\nlook at my, look at my shalls.\n\n378\n00:21:14.676 --> 00:21:20.190\nMy shalls, my part one, are I have to\nhave interfaces to financial management.\n\n379\n00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:27.610\nWhich means that I have to understand\nhow much each of our components cost,\n\n380\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.030\nand what value they\nare to the organization.\n\n381\n00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:38.330\nNow we do not, by the way,\nwe do not audit on\n\n382\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.660\nthe financial asset management process,\nitself.\n\n383\n00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.440\nThat's outside of the scope\nof service management.\n\n384\n00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.660\nBut we do expect you to have links,\n\n385\n00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.810\nrelationships, into\nfinancial asset management.\n\n386\n00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:58.921\nSo whether you have the cost of your\ncomponents, whether you have those\n\n387\n00:21:58.921 --> 00:22:03.619\ncosts defined in your CMDB or\nnot, that's completely up to you.\n\n388\n00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:07.041\nBut if you don't have them\ndefined in your CMDB,\n\n389\n00:22:07.041 --> 00:22:09.966\nwe expect to see a relationship in place.\n\n390\n00:22:09.966 --> 00:22:14.570\nSo we have to see that interface,\nthat is part of the show me.\n\n391\n00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.910\nSo, if you don't have it in your CMS,\nand some organizations don't,\n\n392\n00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:25.518\nthen you do need to have that information,\nor that relationship in place.\n\n393\n00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:29.233\nThe intent is, that you've got to control,\nand report, and\n\n394\n00:22:29.233 --> 00:22:31.300\nverify configuration items.\n\n395\n00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.090\nNow, of course,\nif you look at the individual\n\n396\n00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.500\nactions there in that first bullet point.\n\n397\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.200\nYou'll notice that that's pretty much\nplucked itself straight out of service\n\n398\n00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:48.810\nasset and configuration management\nfrom our ITIL foundation shows.\n\n399\n00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.540\nYou'll see that these are the actions,\n\n400\n00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:57.300\nthis is the process for service asset and\nconfiguration management within ITIL.\n\n401\n00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.524\nBut then look at the next intent.\n\n402\n00:22:59.524 --> 00:23:04.489\nAnd again, these are intents, so\nthese are not, you must do this,\n\n403\n00:23:04.489 --> 00:23:07.291\nbut this is what you really should do.\n\n404\n00:23:07.291 --> 00:23:10.805\nYou really want to be maintaining the\nintegrity of the information that you've\n\n405\n00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:12.334\ngot about all of your components.\n\n406\n00:23:12.334 --> 00:23:15.840\nAnd ensure that the information\nthat you've got is accurate.\n\n407\n00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.191\nNow the reason why this can't be\nin a part one, you must do this,\n\n408\n00:23:20.191 --> 00:23:23.829\nis because not everything\nthat you keep is accurate.\n\n409\n00:23:23.829 --> 00:23:27.735\nLet's face it, as I've already mentioned,\nI could go home this evening and\n\n410\n00:23:27.735 --> 00:23:30.020\nI could make some changes to my laptop.\n\n411\n00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.166\nAnd I could bring it in and plug it in,\nwhich means that your configuration\n\n412\n00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:35.118\nmanagement system is\nnot up to date anymore.\n\n413\n00:23:35.118 --> 00:23:40.490\nOkay, so we can't make that mandatory,\nit's not something that we have to see.\n\n414\n00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.500\nIt's something that we have to,\n\n415\n00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.630\nit's something that we should\nbe able to demonstrate.\n\n416\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.135\nBut we can't make that mandatory,\nbecause people make changes all the time.\n\n417\n00:23:50.135 --> 00:23:51.791\nAnd, unfortunately,\n\n418\n00:23:51.791 --> 00:23:56.771\npeople make changes without approval\nquite a lot of the time, as well.\n\n419\n00:23:56.771 --> 00:23:58.811\nBut what do we have to have, then?\n\n420\n00:23:58.811 --> 00:23:59.831\nWell, look at this.\n\n421\n00:23:59.831 --> 00:24:02.360\nI've already mentioned attributes.\n\n422\n00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:08.401\nAnd attributes, when it comes to our CIs,\nare things like the unique identifier,\n\n423\n00:24:08.401 --> 00:24:11.940\nas I've already mentioned,\nits description,\n\n424\n00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.621\nthe relationships, the status,\nthe version, the location.\n\n425\n00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:18.924\nAll of these are attributes.\n\n426\n00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:22.661\nBut there should also be, you've\nalready seen in that previous diagram,\n\n427\n00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:24.855\na relationship with change management.\n\n428\n00:24:24.855 --> 00:24:27.460\nAnd there should be a relationship,\n\n429\n00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.620\nas I've explained previously,\nbetween configuration management and\n\n430\n00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.120\nproblem managements in known areas,\nand incident managements as well.\n\n431\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.290\nAnd this particular diagram for\nconfiguration management is,\n\n432\n00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.740\nif you remember from your ITIL foundation,\nthose activities that we mentioned in\n\n433\n00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.570\nthe intent a couple of slides ago,\nthis is what I want to see.\n\n434\n00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:52.490\nThat we plan what items we're going to\n\n435\n00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:57.370\nmanage in configuration management, that\nwe're able to identify all of the CIs,\n\n436\n00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:03.570\nthat we have controls in place to control\nour CI, that we account for their status,\n\n437\n00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:08.790\nand that we are able to report\non our CI's and take baselines,\n\n438\n00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.886\nand that we verify and audit on a regular\nbasis that our CI's are indeed accurate,\n\n439\n00:25:13.886 --> 00:25:18.160\nthat the information that we keep in\nour configuration management system\n\n440\n00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.070\nis accurate and up-to-date.\n\n441\n00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.200\nLook at my shalls when it comes\nto configuration management.\n\n442\n00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.058\nI have to have information for each CI.\n\n443\n00:25:29.058 --> 00:25:32.520\nNow, we can't tell you\nwhat information to have,\n\n444\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.570\nalthough we will tell you\nif we go back two slides,\n\n445\n00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.670\nwe will tell you that you have to\nhave these attributes for every CI.\n\n446\n00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.840\nThese are shalls.\n\n447\n00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.000\nThese are not this, is not vague.\n\n448\n00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.850\nThese are shalls.\n\n449\n00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.930\nYou have to have these attributes for\neach CI.\n\n450\n00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.850\nBut what the actual\nspecific information for\n\n451\n00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.750\neach CI looks like is entirely up to you.\n\n452\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.090\nSo let's go back again.\n\n453\n00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.450\nWe'll tell you it has to\nhave unique identifier.\n\n454\n00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:07.060\nBut whether you want your unique\nidentifier to be two characters long,\n\n455\n00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.160\nor whether you want your unique\nidentifier to be 25 characters long,\n\n456\n00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.050\nthat's entirely up to you.\n\n457\n00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.680\n&gt;&gt; What about our versions for our people?\n\n458\n00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.182\nIs that like my better\nversion of myself [LAUGH]?\n\n459\n00:26:20.182 --> 00:26:21.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n460\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.430\nif that was the case I probably\nwould have had about 35 iterations.\n\n461\n00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.870\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean, I'm with you [LAUGH].\n\n462\n00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.250\n&gt;&gt; But people certainly do change.\n\n463\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.446\nAnd I don't just mean having\na better version of yourself.\n\n464\n00:26:34.446 --> 00:26:36.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Although I wish that,\n\n465\n00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.620\nI think I've gone past that point.\n\n466\n00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.865\nI've gone past the point\nof no return on this now.\n\n467\n00:26:39.865 --> 00:26:42.610\n[LAUGH] But yeah, people will change.\n\n468\n00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.890\nThey'll change their roles.\n\n469\n00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:48.462\nThey will change their ranking, for\ninstance, within the organization.\n\n470\n00:26:48.462 --> 00:26:50.610\nThey may change their location.\n\n471\n00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.160\nSo all of these may change.\n\n472\n00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.738\n&gt;&gt; Details are good here.\n\n473\n00:26:52.738 --> 00:26:53.752\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n474\n00:26:53.752 --> 00:26:56.700\nThey may change their access, etc.\n\n475\n00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:02.090\nSo whatever details you're\norganization wants to keep, then we're\n\n476\n00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:06.730\nnot going to dictate that, we're not going\nto say you have to keep this information.\n\n477\n00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:11.380\nBut you do have to keep things like the,\nI mean, obviously not the version,\n\n478\n00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.910\nbut things like your status, whether\nyou're full time, whether your part time,\n\n479\n00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:21.260\nwhether you're retired, whether you're\non maternity leave or paternity leave.\n\n480\n00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.474\nAll of those sort of things.\n\n481\n00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:24.170\nThat's considered to be a status.\n\n482\n00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.793\nSo therefore,\nthey could be subject to change.\n\n483\n00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.920\nSo what else do we need to keep, then?\n\n484\n00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.690\nWell, what else do I need to see?\n\n485\n00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:37.080\nI need to see, well,\na documented procedure.\n\n486\n00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.370\nSo the process has gotta be documented.\n\n487\n00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.773\nAnd I've got to see control.\n\n488\n00:27:44.428 --> 00:27:46.100\nThat's a tricky one.\n\n489\n00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.705\nBut what it means is that what you've\ngot to be able to demonstrate,\n\n490\n00:27:50.705 --> 00:27:55.610\nis you have to demonstrate that\nthere is a control over access to\n\n491\n00:27:55.610 --> 00:28:00.290\nthe configuration management system,\nand there is a defined control\n\n492\n00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:04.444\nover who can update\nthe configuration management system.\n\n493\n00:28:04.444 --> 00:28:06.750\nLet me give you a common dilemma, okay?\n\n494\n00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:11.480\nA common dilemma is in the form\nof the verification and\n\n495\n00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.290\naudit, which is the last\nstep here in our slide,\n\n496\n00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:20.700\nthe last step in our process for\nconfiguration management system.\n\n497\n00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:26.470\nSo verification and audit means\nverifying that the right information is\n\n498\n00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:31.170\nin our database relating\nto our configuration item.\n\n499\n00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.600\nSo who is that verifies this\ninformation on a regular basis?\n\n500\n00:28:37.105 --> 00:28:38.340\nAny idea?\n\n501\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.220\n&gt;&gt; Process owner?\n\n502\n00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.110\n&gt;&gt; It's not, no.\nSomething a lot more simple than that.\n\n503\n00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.910\nIt's the service desk.\n\n504\n00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; On a regular basis.\n\n505\n00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.820\n&gt;&gt; That's right, because when people\ncall in and they're responsible for\n\n506\n00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.680\nmaking any kind changes that,\nthat information is incorrect.\n\n507\n00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\nnow you just hit the nail on the head.\n\n508\n00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.140\nSo what actually happens is\nthat you call the service desk,\n\n509\n00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.370\nthe service desk will ask for\nyour name or your user ID.\n\n510\n00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.940\nAnd then the service test\nwill then say okay, Cherokee,\n\n511\n00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.730\nI see that you are on the third floor and\nthat you've got an Apple laptop.\n\n512\n00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.610\nAnd you say, no, I'm not.\n\n513\n00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:15.540\nI'm on the second floor now and\nI've got an HP laptop.\n\n514\n00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.570\nNow, and this is where it's very,\nvery important,\n\n515\n00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:25.670\nbecause what I want to see is I\nwant to see a degree of control.\n\n516\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.810\nIn other words, I wanna see something\ndocumented as to whether you allow\n\n517\n00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:37.300\nthe service desk then to update that\ninformation, or whether you insist that\n\n518\n00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.740\nthe service desk analyst then raises a\nchange request to update that information.\n\n519\n00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:48.580\nBecause if I go back now to\nthis particular slide here,\n\n520\n00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.980\nyou'll see that every change to our\nconfiguration management system and\n\n521\n00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.870\nto our CIs, needs to have\nan associated request for change.\n\n522\n00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:56.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n523\n00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.140\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhat do we allow the service desk to do?\n\n524\n00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.680\nAnd this gets quite difficult because,\n\n525\n00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.210\ndon't forget, we are auditing on a basis\nof efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n526\n00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:11.390\nIs it efficient to make\na service desk analyst\n\n527\n00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:15.320\nraise an RFC in order to\nchange your information?\n\n528\n00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:15.880\nProbably not.\n\n529\n00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.640\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, yeah.\n\n530\n00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:21.510\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now we're getting\ninto the realms of, right, okay,\n\n531\n00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.570\nwell, if that's not efficient,\nhow do I demonstrate control?\n\n532\n00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.050\nOr do I just let the service\ndesk analyst update it anyway.\n\n533\n00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, except for\nthings maybe like access changes.\n\n534\n00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:37.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm not going to judge\n\n535\n00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:41.170\nwhat decision you've made in that dilemma,\ncuz that's a dilemma.\n\n536\n00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.160\nCuz we don't want to be too bureaucratic,\n\n537\n00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.620\nchange management is already\nseen as too bureaucratic.\n\n538\n00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.730\nWe don't want to be too bureaucratic.\n\n539\n00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.840\nBut at the same time,\nI need to see that you've made a decision.\n\n540\n00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.450\nI need to see that you have some control.\n\n541\n00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:57.510\nBecause changes to any CIs should\nbe traceable and auditable.\n\n542\n00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:01.110\nSo I need to see that, and\nI need to see that you have control.\n\n543\n00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.890\nThese are the Shalls,\n\n544\n00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.570\nincluding that configuration\nbaseline before any change is made.\n\n545\n00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.440\nSo again, think about this.\n\n546\n00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.190\nCherokee's just called\nthe service desk and\n\n547\n00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.440\ntold me that she's got a different\nlaptop to what she has.\n\n548\n00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.840\nDo I need to take it baseline\nnow before I make that change\n\n549\n00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.230\nin our configuration management system?\n\n550\n00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:31.290\nI want to see documented procedure,\nand I want to see a degree of control.\n\n551\n00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:32.400\nThat's what I want to see.\n\n552\n00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:37.570\nSo when it comes to my configuration\nmanagement system, and\n\n553\n00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:43.030\nmy configuration management databases,\nI want to see that access is controlled.\n\n554\n00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:49.600\nI want to see that reliability\nof the data in there is assured,\n\n555\n00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.570\nand that it's accurate,\nthat every CI has got a unique identifier,\n\n556\n00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:58.060\nand that audits happen on\na regular basis as well.\n\n557\n00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.624\nThe service desk are verifying\nthe information on a regular basis,\n\n558\n00:32:01.624 --> 00:32:03.760\nas we've already discussed.\n\n559\n00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.390\nBut we still should have\nan audit on a regular basis,\n\n560\n00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.700\nmaybe once every six months or\nmaybe once every year.\n\n561\n00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.500\nWe should have a formal audit to\naudit what we have in the CMDB,\n\n562\n00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.420\nin our Configuration Management System,\n\n563\n00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:23.250\nto ensure that our information is\nup to date and that it is accurate.\n\n564\n00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.627\nAnd yes, you've got to show evidence\nthat those audits are taking place.\n\n565\n00:32:28.627 --> 00:32:32.450\nAnd you've got to show evidence of that\nintegration with change management.\n\n566\n00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:39.330\nAny master copies of any software that\nis stored within our configuration\n\n567\n00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:44.520\nmanagement system, including the actual\ndefinitive versions of the software or\n\n568\n00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:50.230\nthe license information, documentation,\netc, there has to be version control.\n\n569\n00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:55.170\nAnd again, you have to\ndemonstrate the version control.\n\n570\n00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.370\nYou have to demonstrate\nthat this control exists.\n\n571\n00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.870\nSo within configuration management\nin terms of the Shalls,\n\n572\n00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:08.020\nin terms of the Shown Me,\nthere's actually quite a lot.\n\n573\n00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.320\nBecause here we are spending some\ntime concentrating on relationships\n\n574\n00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.960\nbecause of course this is your foundation.\n\n575\n00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.060\nConfiguration management is where\nwe keep all of our accurate and\n\n576\n00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.020\nreliable information.\n\n577\n00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:26.430\nAnd if that's the case, we've got to\nmake sure that in order to demonstrate\n\n578\n00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:31.690\nthat our entire service management is\naccurate and reliable and efficient and\n\n579\n00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:36.940\neffective, and let's face it, that's the\nentire objective of the ISO 20000 audit.\n\n580\n00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.230\nWell, in order to be\nable to demonstrate this,\n\n581\n00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.620\nI have to make sure that my\ninformation is protected.\n\n582\n00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:49.540\nAnd so, yes, there's a lot of control\nover configuration management system\n\n583\n00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:54.230\nbecause this is our single source of\naccurate and reliable information, and\n\n584\n00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.030\nwe have to ensure the integrity\nof the information in there.\n\n585\n00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.030\nSo for this episode we've taken\na look at configuration management.\n\n586\n00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:06.600\nAnd then when we return in our sort of our\npart two in our control processes, we're\n\n587\n00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.140\ngoing to take a look at change management\nand release and deployment management.\n\n588\n00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Jo.\n\n589\n00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:12.970\nThank you for your time.\n\n590\n00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.860\nThank you for being here as well, but for\nthis show we are going to go and sign out.\n\n591\n00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.721\nI have been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n592\n00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:18.646\n&gt;&gt; And I am Jo Peacock.\n\n593\n00:34:18.646 --> 00:34:21.075\n&gt;&gt;

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:18.480\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to your\nISO/IEC 20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n4\n00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.460\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.739\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ntaking a look at Clause Nine.\n\n6\n00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.438\nThis is going to be a part two where\nwe pick right back up with our control\n\n7\n00:00:27.438 --> 00:00:28.136\nprocesses.\n\n8\n00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:30.175\nAnd, of course, we have ISO expert, Mrs.\n\n9\n00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:33.590\nJo Peacock, back in the studios\nwith us to help cover this topic.\n\n10\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.620\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing absolutely great,\nCherokee, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.400\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\n\n13\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.180\nI'm actually like At a cliffhanger\nhere because we were talking\n\n14\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.650\nabout control processes,\nthen we ran out of time.\n\n15\n00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.670\nSo, we're back here to pick right back up,\nright?\n\n16\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.989\n&gt;&gt; She needs to get out more, right?\n\n17\n00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.126\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If this is a cliffhanger,\nshe needs to get out more.\n\n18\n00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:53.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Living on the edge,\nJo, that's the only way to go.\n\n19\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.515\n&gt;&gt; If this is on the edge,\nyou desperately need to get out more.\n\n20\n00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:02.300\n[LAUGH] This is ISO 20000.\n\n21\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.148\nOkay, it's not a good movie.\n\n22\n00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.795\n[LAUGH] That's a cliffhanger right?\n\n23\n00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:08.668\nA good movie.\n\n24\n00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:09.606\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n25\n00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:12.462\n&gt;&gt; But, we can carry on with change\nmanagement if that will make you feel\n\n26\n00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:13.010\nfulfilled.\n\n27\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.730\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Jo.\n\n28\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.645\n&gt;&gt; We can carry on.\n\n29\n00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:17.616\n[LAUGH] All right.\nWell, let's take a look, then,\n\n30\n00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:18.211\nat part two.\n\n31\n00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:24.990\nAll of our control processes in\nour last in our last episode even.\n\n32\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.472\nYeah, that's old it's like a good movie.\n\n33\n00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:30.620\nYeah, only this time go get out\nof here and forget everything.\n\n34\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.404\nYeah, so in all aspects of without\nyou configuration management and\n\n35\n00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:40.344\nwe looked at the relationship I sleep\nbetween configuration management and\n\n36\n00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:45.052\naround it change management if you\nremember this particular diagram And\n\n37\n00:01:45.052 --> 00:01:48.011\nthis diagram came from\nour ITIL foundation.\n\n38\n00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:53.195\nSo this is just an example of that\nrelationship, but nevertheless that just\n\n39\n00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:58.570\nshows how important configuration\nmanagement to change management.\n\n40\n00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.090\nAnd change management is all\nabout controlling changes\n\n41\n00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.700\nthat are made to our service\nmanagement environment.\n\n42\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.840\nSo take a look at the Part 2, the intent,\nright down at the bottom there.\n\n43\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.540\nIt's about managing changes through the\nlife cycle, making sure that all changes\n\n44\n00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.110\nare assessed and approved and implemented\nand reviewed in a controlled manner.\n\n45\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.360\nNow, we can't make that a shall.\n\n46\n00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.800\nWe cannot put that into the Part One.\n\n47\n00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.930\nIt's not something that we can audit\nagainst because it says ensuring that\n\n48\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.950\nall changes are assessed and approved and\nwe know [LAUGH] We know this is IT.\n\n49\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.360\nWe know that some changes,\nnot all of them,\n\n50\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.720\nmanage to go through\nthe change management process.\n\n51\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.740\nBecause change management,\nas a process itself,\n\n52\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.720\ncertainly in the day-to-day\nenvironment that we have,\n\n53\n00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.560\nchange management is generally perceived\nto be bureaucratic, and is the process\n\n54\n00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.640\nthat is the most bypassed process\nin the whole of service management.\n\n55\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.050\nPeople will do their utmost to not\nhave to go through changed management.\n\n56\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.910\nSo this is why its really\nimportant because I will tell you\n\n57\n00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.220\nthat a changed management process\nthat is too bureaucratic,\n\n58\n00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.510\nis actually a very ineffective\nchanged management process.\n\n59\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.350\nNot only is it inefficient\nbecause it's too bureaucratic\n\n60\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.260\nthere were too many steps in it\nwell there's too much red tape.\n\n61\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.150\nTheres too many things trying to trip\nyou up but not only is it an efficient\n\n62\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.310\nit's ineffective because of a process\nis perceived to be too bureaucratic\n\n63\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.240\npeople gonna try and buy passage so\nit's completely ineffective.\n\n64\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.620\nSo we'll tell you.\n\n65\n00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.950\nThat your change management process\nshouldn't be bureaucratic and\n\n66\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.290\nit shouldn't be inefficient or\nineffective, but it has to be controlled.\n\n67\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.220\nAnd if you're looking for further advice\non how to Implement an efficient and\n\n68\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.270\neffective change management process,\nthen take a look at your shows.\n\n69\n00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.280\nAnd in our shows, certainly within service\ntransition we spent a few episodes in\n\n70\n00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.430\nlooking at change management, and how we\ncan implement a change management process\n\n71\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.820\nthat is still effective But\nit is still efficient as well.\n\n72\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.840\nSo we removed the bureaucracy .This makes\nit quite difficult though for us to audit.\n\n73\n00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.130\nAnd auditing the change Management\nProcess, given that change management has\n\n74\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.190\ngot to control all changes to our\nenvironment, to our infrastructure.\n\n75\n00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.370\nBut yet, we've still got to be efficient\nand effective, and the change management\n\n76\n00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.390\nis the most bypassed process within\nthe whole of service management.\n\n77\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.770\nIn terms of auditing,\nwe have got to audit to make sure that\n\n78\n00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.180\nthe process is effective and is efficient.\n\n79\n00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.180\nSo we've got to see You've got to show,\nyou've got demonstrate.\n\n80\n00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.520\nBecause we've got to see a policy for\nchange management.\n\n81\n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.200\nThat includes what is\ncovered by change management?\n\n82\n00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.330\nWhat falls under the scope\nof change management?\n\n83\n00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.570\nIf you're in an environment where the\nenvironment says bring your own device,\n\n84\n00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.050\nAnd if Cherokee decides that she\nwants to add in a new, I don't know,\n\n85\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.810\nmaybe she's found a new app on\nthe internet that allows her to,\n\n86\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.840\nI don't know, maybe change photos and\nthings like that.\n\n87\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.580\nAdd funny ears onto herself\nwhen she's taking a selfie.\n\n88\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.370\n&gt;&gt; Selfie.\n\n89\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThen, in that case\n\n90\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.760\nThen do we control that or not?\n\n91\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.440\nBecause we're in a bring your\nown device environment, so\n\n92\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.550\ntherefore it's your device and\nsurely you can do what you want to it.\n\n93\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.610\nHowever, some change that you make,\nyou could,\n\n94\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.080\nas I explained in a previous episode.\n\n95\n00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.370\nYou could bring into this environment, and\n\n96\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.640\nit could spread a virus\naround to everybody.\n\n97\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.540\nSo how do we control that?\n\n98\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.570\nWell, I can't answer everything.\n\n99\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.530\nNot right now, anyway because I don't\nknow your organization but what I can\n\n100\n00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.550\ntell you is that in terms of an audit, we\nwanna see that you have control on that.\n\n101\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.100\nSo we want to see demonstration\nthat you have said, okay,\n\n102\n00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.940\nthis is within the scope\nchange management.\n\n103\n00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.190\nAnd this is outside of\nthe scope of change management.\n\n104\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.650\nBy the way, no auditor is going to\ntolerate you turning around and\n\n105\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.890\nsaying that everything is outside\nof the scope of change management.\n\n106\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.690\nThat is not an easy way to\nget out of this [LAUGH].\n\n107\n00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.000\nYeah okay then that doesn't\ncome on to change management.\n\n108\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.660\nThat's not an easy way to get out of this.\n\n109\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.240\nYou can't exclude everything.\n\n110\n00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.520\nCuz change management, as you can\nsee from the intent at the bottom,\n\n111\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.840\nis ensuring that changes are assessed and\napproved and implemented.\n\n112\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.910\nIt's about changing our environment.\n\n113\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.680\nSo we have to make sure that we\ncontrol all changes our environment,\n\n114\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.870\nbut we do have to have a policy that\ndefines the scope of change management.\n\n115\n00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.260\nAnd a policy that determines which\nchanges are going to have a major impact,\n\n116\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.070\nand how we're going to record them and\nhow we're going to classify them.\n\n117\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.990\nAnd who's going to approve\nour requests for change,\n\n118\n00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.929\nincluding our emergency changes.\n\n119\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.580\nAnd going through this process,\n\n120\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.380\nlet's say a company didn't have\nthese policies set in place or any\n\n121\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.250\nkind of controls there, this is something\nthat really needs to happen any way.\n\n122\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.340\nAnd having that network access policy and\n\n123\n00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.580\nhaving some form of network access\ncontrol and having it documented.\n\n124\n00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.541\nI know you're the one that's out there in\nthe field looking at these companies and\n\n125\n00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:44.701\nto me it just seems like common sense but\nyou know this is something\n\n126\n00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:48.149\nthat's even official in addition to\njust getting through that audit,\n\n127\n00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:51.096\nlike you would cover several\ntimes throughout these shows.\n\n128\n00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.353\nLike this is not the sole purpose,\nthis is not the one and done deal,\n\n129\n00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:56.540\nit's hey let's keep the ball rolling here.\n\n130\n00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.996\n&gt;&gt; It is and you know It's funny, we don't\nlike bureaucracy okay it's human nature,\n\n131\n00:08:00.996 --> 00:08:04.537\nwe don't like bureaucracy,\nwe don't like being told what to do.\n\n132\n00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:07.585\nBut when it comes to our IT environment,\nwe've gotta be very,\n\n133\n00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:10.630\nvery careful about what\nhappens in our IT environment.\n\n134\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.620\nAnd so, and\nI'll say this with service management.\n\n135\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.770\nA lot of service management, and\n\n136\n00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.130\na lot of best practice in service\nmanagement is about making sense.\n\n137\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.020\nIt's just about doing the thing\nthat makes the most sense.\n\n138\n00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.270\nIt's about common sense really\nnothing more than that.\n\n139\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.202\nWe've got to have that control.\n\n140\n00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:30.660\nYou've gotta control who\nyou have on your network.\n\n141\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.720\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, it's your responsibility.\n\n142\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.985\n&gt;&gt; Right, the fact that you could\npotentially download an app onto your\n\n143\n00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:43.250\nlaptop that allows you to put little\nfloppy ears on your selfies Could\n\n144\n00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:49.363\nactually wipe out every single network or\nevery single PC in this environment.\n\n145\n00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:51.444\nAnd when I say every single PC,\n\n146\n00:08:51.444 --> 00:08:56.340\nevery single PC that's used in\nthe network that we're using right now.\n\n147\n00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.410\nAnd that's not just about every single PC,\n\n148\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.986\nit's also about all of\nthe equipment that we're using.\n\n149\n00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:07.666\nIt could take us offline for\ndays just because you wanted fluffy ears.\n\n150\n00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:10.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.977\n&gt;&gt; And it sounds quite trivial\n\n152\n00:09:11.977 --> 00:09:16.188\nuntil you realize the implications, and\nthe unfortunate thing is that change\n\n153\n00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:19.714\nmanagement is quite often perceived\nas being too bureaucratic.\n\n154\n00:09:19.714 --> 00:09:23.347\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nit's not just because I wanna act cool and\n\n155\n00:09:23.347 --> 00:09:26.669\nflex my IT muscle and\nbully you around not at all.\n\n156\n00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:31.518\n&gt;&gt; No, no and in fact, it's organizations\nthat realize just what happens when\n\n157\n00:09:31.518 --> 00:09:34.342\nchange management isn't in place.\n\n158\n00:09:34.342 --> 00:09:36.457\nAnd when you realize the implication,\n\n159\n00:09:36.457 --> 00:09:39.414\nunfortunately it's too\nlate when that's happened.\n\n160\n00:09:39.414 --> 00:09:42.274\nThe organization that\nsuffered a major loss in\n\n161\n00:09:42.274 --> 00:09:46.172\nsales because their entire network\nwas wiped out for two days.\n\n162\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.790\nNow when you say a major loss in sales,\n\n163\n00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.890\nthere's one organization that I\nhave worked with that suffered.\n\n164\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.662\nWell, let's just say they suffered\nprobably about $2 million worth of\n\n165\n00:09:59.662 --> 00:10:04.090\nsales loss because of an ineffective\nchange in management process.\n\n166\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.025\nBecause changes were being made people\nwere trying to change management was\n\n167\n00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.047\ntoo bureaucratic.\n\n168\n00:10:10.047 --> 00:10:13.920\nPeople were bypassing change\nmanagement and we all know this, okay?\n\n169\n00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.457\nWe've all been in environments\nwhere I know somebody.\n\n170\n00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:15.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n171\n00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.484\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know somebody so\n\n172\n00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:24.449\nI'm going to, let me just go and\nask Ronnie, Ronnie will do that for me.\n\n173\n00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:29.220\nAnd Ronnie just, man, okay,\nit's only gonna take me two minutes to do.\n\n174\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.440\nSo Ronnie doesn't bother and I'm putting\nall the blame on Ronnie, by the way.\n\n175\n00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.413\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He's not even\nhere to defend himself.\n\n176\n00:10:34.413 --> 00:10:37.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's not, nope,\nhe's in another studio I think right now,\n\n177\n00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:38.989\nso we'll blame him, it's great.\n\n178\n00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:42.420\n[LAUGH] But yeah, so\nRonnie makes the change.\n\n179\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.370\nRonnie doesn't raise the RFC, so\nwe don't have the baseline taken.\n\n180\n00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.891\nAnd the change is made, and\nthe RFC is not then closed, and\n\n181\n00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:55.334\nthe changes made in all of\na sudden everything goes dark.\n\n182\n00:10:57.254 --> 00:10:59.878\nAll because we wanted\nto bypass the process.\n\n183\n00:10:59.878 --> 00:11:03.088\nAnd it's not just one person that\nwanted to bypass the process,\n\n184\n00:11:03.088 --> 00:11:07.025\nI wanted to bypass the process, Ronnie\nwas quite happy to bypass the process.\n\n185\n00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:09.560\nAnd then it's taking down everything.\n\n186\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.657\nAnd this is exactly what happened,\nand like I say,\n\n187\n00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:16.702\nmillions of dollars were lost,\njust because of that one mistake.\n\n188\n00:11:16.702 --> 00:11:21.440\nSo we don't like the bureaucracy,\nwhich is why I say, and\n\n189\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.116\nif your change process\nis too bureaucratic,\n\n190\n00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:28.903\nthen it is ineffective, it's inefficient.\n\n191\n00:11:28.903 --> 00:11:31.608\nIf the process is too bureaucratic,\n\n192\n00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:37.190\nthen quite simply it's going to damage\nyour IT at some point and time.\n\n193\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.645\nBecause people are gonna try and\nfind a way around it.\n\n194\n00:11:40.645 --> 00:11:44.993\nAnd you know what, we can be really\nresourceful when we want to be.\n\n195\n00:11:44.993 --> 00:11:46.586\nWhen it comes to trying and find a way-\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n196\n00:11:46.586 --> 00:11:49.584\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Around that process we can be really\n\n197\n00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:50.490\nresourceful.\n\n198\n00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.487\nIt's like the organization's that try and\n\n199\n00:11:53.487 --> 00:11:58.916\nprevent unnecessary change by locking\ndown their desktops and their laptops.\n\n200\n00:11:58.916 --> 00:12:03.415\n&gt;&gt; And you almost wonder if I had put that\nmuch effort into the actual process itself\n\n201\n00:12:03.415 --> 00:12:07.669\ninstead of the work arounds then maybe\nI wouldn't be in this predicament.\n\n202\n00:12:07.669 --> 00:12:13.086\n&gt;&gt; Right, it always amazes me how much\ntime and effort you will see a person\n\n203\n00:12:13.086 --> 00:12:18.251\nput into trying to break through\nthe security controls on a laptop.\n\n204\n00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:21.749\nAnd you just think, if you went through\nthe official channels you actually would\n\n205\n00:12:21.749 --> 00:12:23.412\nhave got what you wanted by now.\n\n206\n00:12:23.412 --> 00:12:25.760\nBut nevertheless it's\ntaken you three weeks and\n\n207\n00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.462\nyou've managed to get through\nsome of the encryption.\n\n208\n00:12:28.462 --> 00:12:32.307\nBut not all of it, so you're not gonna\nget there, because we put it in place for\n\n209\n00:12:32.307 --> 00:12:32.842\na reason.\n\n210\n00:12:32.842 --> 00:12:38.476\nIt's crazy the amount of effort that\npeople will put into it, and even\n\n211\n00:12:38.476 --> 00:12:44.990\nunderstanding the implications that it\ncould have are still willing to do that.\n\n212\n00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.948\nSo what else do then we need\nto demonstrate then in change\n\n213\n00:12:49.948 --> 00:12:53.280\nmanagement in terms of our audit?\n\n214\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.780\nWell, you've gotta demonstrate that\nall changes have got a defined scope.\n\n215\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.125\nSo we understand\nthe implication of the change.\n\n216\n00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:08.212\nThat they're all assessed and that they're\nall authorized by the relevant authority.\n\n217\n00:13:08.212 --> 00:13:11.468\nAnd when I say relevant authority,\nI mean and\n\n218\n00:13:11.468 --> 00:13:16.522\nI'm gonna say again show me a small\nchange may only need local approval\n\n219\n00:13:16.522 --> 00:13:20.910\nwhereas a change is going to\naffect the whole organization.\n\n220\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.915\nMight need board level approval.\n\n221\n00:13:22.915 --> 00:13:26.254\nI want to see evidence of\na change authority matrix.\n\n222\n00:13:26.254 --> 00:13:30.611\nI want to see evidence\nthat you have a formal\n\n223\n00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:35.099\nmechanism in place to approve all changes.\n\n224\n00:13:35.099 --> 00:13:40.379\nThe decision making on all of our\nchanges include the impact to services,\n\n225\n00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:43.702\nthe service requirements\nfrom the customer,\n\n226\n00:13:43.702 --> 00:13:47.979\nthe risks and the benefits,\nand financial impact as well.\n\n227\n00:13:47.979 --> 00:13:53.041\nEven if the statement simply says\nthere is no financial impact,\n\n228\n00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.052\nwhich I will never believe by the way.\n\n229\n00:13:56.052 --> 00:13:59.224\nBut even if the statement says\nthere was no financial impact,\n\n230\n00:13:59.224 --> 00:14:01.122\nthat statement needs to be in there.\n\n231\n00:14:01.122 --> 00:14:05.663\nThat needs to be somewhere and of course,\nwe can use a tool to help us with this.\n\n232\n00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:08.930\nA call logging tool should\nfacilitate a lot of this.\n\n233\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.150\nBut there needs to be some\nstatement in there that says,\n\n234\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.350\nyes there's no financial impact.\n\n235\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.250\nI'm gonna say,\n\n236\n00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.380\nI'm gonna struggle to believe that\njust think about common sense.\n\n237\n00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.585\nThe negative effects\nof any failed changes,\n\n238\n00:14:22.585 --> 00:14:26.060\nthey're gong to have a financial impact,\nthey really are.\n\n239\n00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.949\nSo we expect to see that, definitely.\n\n240\n00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:32.944\nSo, we need to see evidence\nof how we approve changes and\n\n241\n00:14:32.944 --> 00:14:36.250\nhow we apply for approval of changes.\n\n242\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.998\nAnd there needs to be a published\nchange schedule as well.\n\n243\n00:14:40.998 --> 00:14:46.178\nAll changes have to be scheduled,\nas I've already said, and\n\n244\n00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:51.769\nwe also have to have a remediational\nplan in place for all changes.\n\n245\n00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:57.432\nRemedial action is, well,\nwhat do we do if something goes wrong?\n\n246\n00:14:57.432 --> 00:15:00.792\nEvery single change has\nto have remedial action.\n\n247\n00:15:00.792 --> 00:15:03.904\nWhether that remedial\naction is just do nothing,\n\n248\n00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:06.282\nthat's one form of remedial action.\n\n249\n00:15:06.282 --> 00:15:11.245\nWhether that remedial action is to revert\nback to the baseline to a previous\n\n250\n00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:15.127\nversion or whether that remedial\naction is to do it again.\n\n251\n00:15:16.753 --> 00:15:22.288\nI want to see evidence that you've\ngot remedial action for each change.\n\n252\n00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:26.260\nThe example that I quite often\nusing this is let's say for\n\n253\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:31.825\ninstance that your organization has\nupgraded it's virus protection, okay.\n\n254\n00:15:31.825 --> 00:15:36.698\nBecause Jo go board in a hotel\nthe other night, she was away and\n\n255\n00:15:36.698 --> 00:15:42.150\nI was fiddling around and\nI thought, I'll create a virus.\n\n256\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.261\nAnd I did, and\nI released it to the big wide world.\n\n257\n00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:48.396\nAnd now our virus protection\npeople have said, right, okay,\n\n258\n00:15:48.396 --> 00:15:51.205\nyou need to update your virus protection,\n\n259\n00:15:51.205 --> 00:15:55.829\nbecause some evil person has released\na virus onto the world wide web.\n\n260\n00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:59.655\nSo You try and\nupdate your virus protection.\n\n261\n00:15:59.655 --> 00:16:03.975\nAnd you get an error message while you're\nupdating your virus protection software,\n\n262\n00:16:03.975 --> 00:16:04.760\nwhat do you do?\n\n263\n00:16:07.077 --> 00:16:08.155\n&gt;&gt; Unplug.\n\n264\n00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:09.253\nDisconnect.\n\n265\n00:16:09.253 --> 00:16:11.735\nTurn off my Wi-Fi.\n\n266\n00:16:11.735 --> 00:16:14.355\n&gt;&gt; So you get an error message\nwhile you're updating your\n\n267\n00:16:14.355 --> 00:16:16.231\nvirus protection software?\n\n268\n00:16:16.231 --> 00:16:16.770\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, Jo,\n\n269\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.871\nI thought you were saying you got\na notification like some kind of malware.\n\n270\n00:16:19.871 --> 00:16:21.294\n&gt;&gt; Asleep today, she's asleep.\n\n271\n00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:24.087\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Obviously I'm not as caffeinated as\n\n272\n00:16:24.087 --> 00:16:24.902\nprevious episodes.\n\n273\n00:16:24.902 --> 00:16:26.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We need coffee.\n\n274\n00:16:26.382 --> 00:16:28.496\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Let's\ntake a step back here.\n\n275\n00:16:28.496 --> 00:16:30.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So updating.\n\n276\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.790\n&gt;&gt; You're updating your virus\nprotection software and\n\n277\n00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.630\nyou get an error message while\nyou're doing that, what do you do?\n\n278\n00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.049\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's see,\nI'm getting an error message.\n\n279\n00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:43.650\nWell, I'm probably gonna try to reinitiate\nto complete that update because that is\n\n280\n00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:44.690\nreally important.\n\n281\n00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.200\nSo that's my next step.\n\n282\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, so do it again then.\n\n283\n00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:48.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So that's\n\n284\n00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.200\nyour remedial action is to do it again and\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n285\n00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.180\nThere's also nothing wrong with a remedial\naction of if it fails, do nothing.\n\n286\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.190\nIn this instance, I would never ever\nrecommend that you just revert back to\n\n287\n00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.270\nyour previous version because if you\ndo that, you're exposing yourself.\n\n288\n00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:09.100\nSo, in this instance, your remedial action\nwould be to okay, something's gone wrong,\n\n289\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.540\nI'm gonna try it again and if it still\nhappens, I'm still going to contact our\n\n290\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.400\nvirus protection, our software provider\nand let them know and find out what\n\n291\n00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.750\nthey recommend cuz, hopefully, I'm not the\nonly person that's got that error message.\n\n292\n00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.800\nEvery single change needs\nto have remedial action.\n\n293\n00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.710\nSo in order to be able to\nachieve the accreditation\n\n294\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.220\nyou have to demonstrate that every single\nchange accommodates a remedial action.\n\n295\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:42.877\nWe also need to demonstrate that changes\nare reviewed for effectiveness as well.\n\n296\n00:17:42.877 --> 00:17:48.460\nThey're dissimilar to a fail change.\n\n297\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.740\nIt's not a fail change.\n\n298\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.350\nWhat it means is,\nwe want to see that changes are effective.\n\n299\n00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.730\nSo that they're actually working\nexactly as they should be.\n\n300\n00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.420\nAnd then again,\ntake any action against that so\n\n301\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:05.020\nmaybe an improvement initiative or maybe\nwe open a new change in the basis of that.\n\n302\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.650\nWe want to analyze our FCs.\n\n303\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.010\nOur request for change.\n\n304\n00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.715\nAnd we want to analyze those, it's talking\nabout detection trends in the number of\n\n305\n00:18:13.715 --> 00:18:17.730\nFCs we get but also in our back\nlog of our FCs for instance.\n\n306\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:22.300\nAnd how many fail changes etc.,\nand everything needs to be,\n\n307\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.590\nthen input into continual\nservice improvement.\n\n308\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.300\nWe want to have evidence that change\nmanagement is being improved.\n\n309\n00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.670\nAnd that leads us quite nicely into\nreleasing deployment management.\n\n310\n00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:41.100\nReleasing deployment management is where\nwe are releasing, we're building and\n\n311\n00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.120\ntesting and implementing new\nreleases into the live environment.\n\n312\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.130\nSo we have to have a release policy.\n\n313\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.930\nWe also have to define what we consider\nto be an emergency release, for\n\n314\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.810\ninstance, the virus protection software.\n\n315\n00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.350\nYou see, the intent is, and\n\n316\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:02.490\nthis is the should, all releases should\nbe deployed into the live environment.\n\n317\n00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.200\nSo that the integrity of hardware and\nthe software and\n\n318\n00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.520\nthe service components are maintained.\n\n319\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.470\nThis is the should.\n\n320\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.210\nBut the problem with the word, all,\n\n321\n00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.980\nmeans that that word all can not\nnecessarily feature in the shall,\n\n322\n00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:24.440\nin the must because you can't ensure that\nall releases are effectively deployed.\n\n323\n00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.240\nI mean that's what we're aiming for,\nright?\n\n324\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.450\nBut we can't make sure\nthat they're all deployed,\n\n325\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.510\neven with the best controls in the world.\n\n326\n00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.090\nAnd let's face it that's\nwhat ISO 20000 is doing.\n\n327\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.140\nIt's all that we got the best\ncontrols in the world.\n\n328\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:42.160\nEven with the best controls in the world,\nthings still happen.\n\n329\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.240\nNot everything is deployed effectively.\n\n330\n00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.960\nSo what we've gotta make sure is\nwe do have the necessary controls,\n\n331\n00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.940\nthat if something does go wrong,\n\n332\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.560\nthen we've got that remedial\naction outlined in the change.\n\n333\n00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.840\nAnd that we can do something about it.\n\n334\n00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.970\nSo this is what could\nbe in a release policy.\n\n335\n00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.360\nNotice what's in bold.\n\n336\n00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.080\nThe frequency of each type of release\nhas to be in the change policy.\n\n337\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.570\nI'm sorry, in the release policy.\n\n338\n00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:11.805\nBut everything else?\n\n339\n00:20:11.805 --> 00:20:15.510\nAnd that's what I'd expect\nto see in a release policy.\n\n340\n00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.800\nI expect to see a definition for\nthe release, I expect to see roles and\n\n341\n00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.840\nresponsibilities.\n\n342\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.770\nAnd authority levels, we've already\ntalked about the authorization matrix and\n\n343\n00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.690\nidentification and rules and\nbuild and packaging.\n\n344\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.920\nThey're gonna be unique for each release.\n\n345\n00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.450\nSo I expect to see for\neach release, a release policy.\n\n346\n00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:42.450\nAnd then each release has to be planned.\n\n347\n00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.810\nSo look at the shells for\nrelease and deployment management.\n\n348\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.300\nWe have to have a plan,\na procedure for an emergency release.\n\n349\n00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.430\nI would consider that updating\nour virus protection software,\n\n350\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.460\nI'd consider that to be an emergency\nrelease, I don't know about you.\n\n351\n00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.130\nBut it's something that has to happen.\n\n352\n00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.310\nEvery single release has to be planned,\nthe deployment has to be planned.\n\n353\n00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:11.200\nAnd so I want to see in every single\nrelease the options they state\n\n354\n00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.080\nis this release going to be deployed\nin a big bang or a phased manner?\n\n355\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.550\nOr is it going to be automated or manual?\n\n356\n00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.370\nIs it going to be pushed out\nfrom a central location or\n\n357\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.950\nis it going to be pulled\ndown individually?\n\n358\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.480\nThat has to be in release management.\n\n359\n00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.980\nIt has to be in our release policy for\neach individual release.\n\n360\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.440\nSo I need to see that that happens for\nevery single release.\n\n361\n00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:42.670\nThere has to be documentary evidence of\na relationship with change management,\n\n362\n00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.010\nbecause, of course,\nthis is how releases happen.\n\n363\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.370\nYeah, we start off by raising the change.\n\n364\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.730\nAnd then the change is submitted for\nassessment and then it's approved.\n\n365\n00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.360\nAnd then at that point in time,\nit's then handed over to release and\n\n366\n00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.620\ndeployment management to build and\nto test and to implement.\n\n367\n00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:08.090\nSo there has to be a direct relationship\nbetween that RFC and the release record.\n\n368\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.220\nNo two ways about that.\n\n369\n00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.310\nThis is not a should,\nthis is not a part two, this is a shall.\n\n370\n00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:17.580\nSo we have to coordinate\nwith change management,\n\n371\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.910\nincluding those we've said references to\nthe RFCs and also to any known areas and\n\n372\n00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.420\nany problems that release\nis going to close.\n\n373\n00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.632\nBecause, don't forget, when we\nlooked at our resolution process and\n\n374\n00:22:29.632 --> 00:22:33.520\nwithin problem management,\nwe have a relationship\n\n375\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.250\ninto change management because we raise\na change to resolve a problem and\n\n376\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:43.180\nthat change then may result in a release\nand then we deploy that release, then that\n\n377\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.969\nmay close the change record and may also\nclose the problem record at the same time.\n\n378\n00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.478\nEvery release has got to include\nthe deployment dates and\n\n379\n00:22:52.478 --> 00:22:57.486\nthe method of deployment, as we've already\nsaid, and service acceptance criteria,\n\n380\n00:22:57.486 --> 00:23:01.100\nevery release has to have\nservice acceptance criteria.\n\n381\n00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.610\nAnd again I want to see evidence of that.\n\n382\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.440\nI also want to see evidence\nthat releases are built, and\n\n383\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.310\nthat they are tested prior to deployment.\n\n384\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.570\nAnd I laugh about that one\nbecause I wonder how many things\n\n385\n00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.505\nare tested in a live environment.\n\n386\n00:23:18.505 --> 00:23:22.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll try not to laugh about that.\n\n387\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right, you know.\n\n388\n00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.030\nNo, we don't test in the live environment.\n\n389\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.800\nWe have a...\n\n390\n00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.470\nand again, these are requirements for\nISO 20000.\n\n391\n00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:37.141\nIf you don't have a controlled test\nenvironment, the key is -- well,\n\n392\n00:23:37.141 --> 00:23:42.426\nthere are two key words there, controlled\n-- it's a controlled environment,\n\n393\n00:23:42.426 --> 00:23:46.194\nit's not just a,\nI just created something on the side.\n\n394\n00:23:46.194 --> 00:23:51.557\nThere has to be a controlled test\nenvironment, somewhere where you test,\n\n395\n00:23:51.557 --> 00:23:56.321\nnot the live environment And\nall of our releases have to be built and\n\n396\n00:23:56.321 --> 00:24:02.700\nthen tested in the test environment before\nit's deployed into the live environment.\n\n397\n00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:09.260\nAnd I need to see evidence of that, I need\nto see evidence that we can verify that\n\n398\n00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.600\nthe release is going to meet the service\nacceptance criteria before it's deployed.\n\n399\n00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.100\nIf it's not going to meet the service that\nsection's criteria then we shouldn't be\n\n400\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.640\ndeploying.\n\n401\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.240\nThat's what it says,\nmake a decision with interested parties.\n\n402\n00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.740\nEvidence of that process has to exist.\n\n403\n00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.180\nEvidence of the test environment and\n\n404\n00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.740\nthe fact that test environment\nis used has to exist.\n\n405\n00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.320\nThere has to be evidence that when\nwe deploy for every single release,\n\n406\n00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:48.010\nthat we deploy maintaining the integrity\nof our Cohen live environment.\n\n407\n00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:53.055\nAnd there has to be evidence of\na remedial plan, mediation plan for\n\n408\n00:24:53.055 --> 00:24:57.846\nevery deployment, and\nthat it's able to be followed as well.\n\n409\n00:24:57.846 --> 00:25:02.659\nNow that's an interesting one because we\ncan put all sorts of remedial plans into\n\n410\n00:25:02.659 --> 00:25:07.290\nour change management process itself\ninto that change record itself.\n\n411\n00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.950\nBut then you do that in the hope\nthat you never have to use it, so\n\n412\n00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.640\nyou're just checking a box, really.\n\n413\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.610\nYou're checking that box that says,\nyeah we've got a mediation plan but\n\n414\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.620\nlet's hope we never have to use it\nbecause it probably won't work.\n\n415\n00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.560\nI've heard that once or\n\n416\n00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.070\nmany times as well, let's just hope\nwe don't have to use that then.\n\n417\n00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.042\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, it has to be usable,\n\n418\n00:25:28.042 --> 00:25:30.140\nit has to be real.\n\n419\n00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:35.215\nAnd so what about after you've\nactually made the deployment then?\n\n420\n00:25:35.215 --> 00:25:40.220\nWell, we need to see evidence,\nyou have to show evidence that for\n\n421\n00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:46.830\nunsuccessful releases you've taken\nthe remedial action, the agreed actions.\n\n422\n00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.390\nAnd that you are actively\nmonitoring the success and\n\n423\n00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:53.790\nfailure of any releases, you're monitoring\nthe impact on the customer, too.\n\n424\n00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:57.410\nSo I'd expect to see evidence\nof satisfaction surveys based\n\n425\n00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:02.370\non the actually release itself.\n\n426\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.976\nSo a satisfaction survey with the release,\n\n427\n00:26:05.976 --> 00:26:10.848\nI need to see action,\nI need to see evidence that any further\n\n428\n00:26:10.848 --> 00:26:15.930\nactions are highlighted as\nopportunities for improvement.\n\n429\n00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.990\nAnd that changed management are taking\ninformation from you to help within\n\n430\n00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:26.090\nimpact assessment for future changes and\nfor future deployment plans.\n\n431\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:31.000\nSo there has to be that review,\nthat feedback to change management.\n\n432\n00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.300\nAnd it has to be controlled,\nnot only does it have to happen, but\n\n433\n00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.010\nit has to be structured and\nit has to be consistent as well.\n\n434\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:45.290\nSo, as far as our controlled processes go,\nthen these were\n\n435\n00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.750\nour two episodes where we looked at the\nrequirements for a controlled processes.\n\n436\n00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:54.900\nAnd as we've seen, as with all of\nour clauses, clauses four through to\n\n437\n00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:00.240\nclause nine, and there are a lot of\nrequirements there, a lot of requirements.\n\n438\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.820\nAnd some of those you'll think are okay\nthen, you know that fairly simple,\n\n439\n00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.100\nwe do in them already and that's okay.\n\n440\n00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.770\nBut some of these,\nyou might look at these and think,\n\n441\n00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.810\nI don't know how we're\ngoing to demonstrate that.\n\n442\n00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.930\nAnd this where our tools will come in,\nthe tools that we use, and\n\n443\n00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.380\nthe configuration of the tools\nthat we use are going to help with\n\n444\n00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.760\ndemonstrated all of these audit\nrequirements, all of them.\n\n445\n00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:30.070\nAnd if you have the right tools then they\nwill get you sort of 80% of the way there.\n\n446\n00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.340\nObviously you have to\ndefine the processes first.\n\n447\n00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.159\nAnd if you need to define\nany of your processes,\n\n448\n00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:40.460\nthen at that point in time I'd say well\nlook Itel is a good place to start,\n\n449\n00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.860\nthat will help you define\nsome of your processes.\n\n450\n00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:50.210\nAnd you can define your processes based\non the service management framework.\n\n451\n00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.630\nAnd it's that point in time when\nyou believe that your processes\n\n452\n00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.810\nare working efficiently and effectively.\n\n453\n00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.530\nAnd that you are able to\ndemonstrate that their working,\n\n454\n00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:03.690\nthat's when we can work\ntoward the ISO 20000 audit.\n\n455\n00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:08.590\nAs I said, you can then bring in your tool\nset to facilitate that way of working, but\n\n456\n00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.730\nyou have to define your processes first.\n\n457\n00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:14.080\nYou have to work out what you need\neach output to be from your processes,\n\n458\n00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.065\nyou have to be able to define the inputs.\n\n459\n00:28:17.065 --> 00:28:21.275\nAnd then you have to be able to\nidentify the actual activities within\n\n460\n00:28:21.275 --> 00:28:22.625\nthe process itself.\n\n461\n00:28:22.625 --> 00:28:28.003\nYou bring in a tool to facilitate that\nprocess, and that should help you to\n\n462\n00:28:28.003 --> 00:28:33.488\ndemonstrate all of the requirements,\nthe shalls within ISO 20000.\n\n463\n00:28:33.488 --> 00:28:39.308\nSo at this point in time now we\nare leaving part one, and now we're going\n\n464\n00:28:39.308 --> 00:28:46.390\nto spend some time in a subsequent episode\nlooking at the actual audit itself.\n\n465\n00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:51.140\nAnd what's required for the audit,\nand you've seen the specifics,\n\n466\n00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.870\nthough you have to demonstrate for\nthe audit.\n\n467\n00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.980\nBut now we're gonna look at the audit\nprocess itself in our subsequent episodes.\n\n468\n00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, thank you for that,\nand thank you for joining us as well.\n\n469\n00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.590\nBut stay tuned, like she said, we need\nto go through the actual audit process,\n\n470\n00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.070\nyou don't wanna miss that.\n\n471\n00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.790\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n472\n00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.250\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n473\n00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n474\n00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.748\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n475\n00:29:10.748 --> 00:29:18.276\n[MUSIC]\n\n476\n00:29:18.276 -->

00:00:08.291\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:12.006\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:17.916\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to your\nISO/IEC 20000:2011 Foundation Series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:20.990\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.475\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at the audit process as well as\n\n8\n00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:25.960\nthe certification process.\n\n9\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.060\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have ISO expert Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.000\nThanks for joining us, Jo.\n\n11\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.940\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.250\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.820\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.030\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n15\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.076\nSo Jo, we've made it through\nall those different clauses.\n\n16\n00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:41.622\n[LAUGH] I know, we've looked at all\nthe definitions, the shells, and\n\n17\n00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:43.858\neven the suggestions\nthat you had given us.\n\n18\n00:00:43.858 --> 00:00:47.000\nSo what will we be looking at this show?\n\n19\n00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.889\n&gt;&gt; Well, now we're ready to audit,\nright, yeah?\n\n20\n00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:52.482\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've got all of our ducks in\n\n21\n00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:57.380\na row as it were and\nwe know what all of our criteria are.\n\n22\n00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.910\nWe know what all of our\nmandatory requirements are.\n\n23\n00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.870\nAnd now we've ensured that\nwe can meet them all.\n\n24\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.872\nSo now we're ready to audit.\n\n25\n00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:07.195\nSo in this particular episode,\nwe're gonna just talk a little bit\n\n26\n00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:12.136\nmore about the actual audit process\nitself and the certification process,\n\n27\n00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:15.952\nand how you would work with\nyour auditor during the audit.\n\n28\n00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:16.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n29\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.070\nI can imagine this would be a pretty\nmaybe not for everyone but for\n\n30\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.540\npeople who get nervous about things,\nit might be kind of an unnerving process,\n\n31\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.070\nespecially when you're going through that.\n\n32\n00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.740\nAnd just understanding what to expect\nmay help eliminate a lot of those\n\n33\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.890\nbutterflies, as it were.\n\n34\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.203\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing that we've got to\nreally get to go through is the fact that\n\n35\n00:01:34.203 --> 00:01:36.338\nan audit is not something\nthat happens overnight.\n\n36\n00:01:36.338 --> 00:01:39.391\nAnd it's not something where you'll\nget an auditor that comes in and\n\n37\n00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:42.179\nwe'll sit down with, and\nwithin one or two days, we'll say,\n\n38\n00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.455\nthat's it, okay,\nyou've achieved the audit.\n\n39\n00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:45.287\nIt's not going to happen.\n\n40\n00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:50.250\nThis is a process, and this is a process\nthat's going to take many, many months.\n\n41\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.759\nAnd so we're just gonna really go all over\nwhat would happen over that process and\n\n42\n00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.230\nover that period of time.\n\n43\n00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.129\nBecause from the moment you decide that\nactually we want to achieve ISO 20000\n\n44\n00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:05.744\naccreditation, then the first thing that\nyou need to do is you need to examine\n\n45\n00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:08.420\nthe part one, which is what we've done.\n\n46\n00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.336\nWe've been through the part one\nrequirements, and you'll need to\n\n47\n00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:16.604\nexamine those part one requirements and\nyou will need to get some advice.\n\n48\n00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:20.734\nAnd that's the first thing that\nyou'll have to do is to seek\n\n49\n00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:24.699\nsome advice from an external\nconsultant such as myself,\n\n50\n00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:28.580\nsomebody who can come in and\nsay, is this feasible?\n\n51\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.229\nThe information that you've got, yes,\n\n52\n00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.338\nthat's enough to be able\nto go through an audit.\n\n53\n00:02:34.338 --> 00:02:37.680\nOr no, you're not going to be able\nto get through the audit with this.\n\n54\n00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.540\nAnd this is the first thing that\nyou're going to have to do,\n\n55\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.200\nis to seek some advice and\nfind out exactly how much work\n\n56\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.820\nyou have got to do in order to be\nable to accredit yourself on audit.\n\n57\n00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.551\nNow and one of the things that I've\nalready mentioned in previous episodes,\n\n58\n00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:57.354\nis the fact that you might want to bring\nsomebody or get somebody trained within\n\n59\n00:02:57.354 --> 00:03:00.944\nyour organization to actually\nperform internal audits.\n\n60\n00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:04.916\nAnd whilst we'll say,\nyes, that's a great idea,\n\n61\n00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:09.431\nas a starting point,\nit's not actually such a great idea,\n\n62\n00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:13.660\nbecause you can send somebody\non training courses.\n\n63\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.650\nWe can all watch this show and\nthis particular episodes.\n\n64\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.424\nThen we can say, I understand what\nall of the requirements are and\n\n65\n00:03:22.424 --> 00:03:24.149\nnow I know what I need to show.\n\n66\n00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:26.870\nBut that's not necessarily the case.\n\n67\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.073\nNobody is going to be able to\nascertain exactly how much\n\n68\n00:03:32.073 --> 00:03:37.062\nis needed just from watching\nshows independently.\n\n69\n00:03:37.062 --> 00:03:40.170\nYou need to be able to,\ncertainly initially,\n\n70\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.360\nsomebody has to sit with you and go\nthrough all of the evidence that you have.\n\n71\n00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.880\nYou might think that you've\ngot sufficient evidence.\n\n72\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.499\nAnd it might turn out that you haven't.\n\n73\n00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:53.403\nSomebody needs to sit with you and\ngo through all of the evidence and\n\n74\n00:03:53.403 --> 00:03:57.654\nreally just say to you, yes, this works,\nyes, this would work but no,\n\n75\n00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.170\nthis will not work.\n\n76\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.023\nThis relationship is not developed enough.\n\n77\n00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:05.767\nBecause you see,\nwhat will happen first of all is,\n\n78\n00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:09.772\nif you just were to go straight\nto an internal auditor or\n\n79\n00:04:09.772 --> 00:04:15.347\nmaybe bring in an external ISO 20000,\nan official auditor to come in,\n\n80\n00:04:15.347 --> 00:04:20.397\nwell, the first thing that they'll\ndo is they will wanna sit down and\n\n81\n00:04:20.397 --> 00:04:23.132\nthey'll ask for all this evidence.\n\n82\n00:04:23.132 --> 00:04:26.931\nAnd if you don't even have a relationship\nin place then you're certainly not going\n\n83\n00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:30.480\nto be able to demonstrate that\nyou've got a relationship in place.\n\n84\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.101\nSo you really need,\nbefore you start down this road,\n\n85\n00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:38.369\nyou need somebody to come in and\ndo an independent assessment.\n\n86\n00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:42.844\nAnd most auditors will be happy to\ndo that for you independently, but\n\n87\n00:04:42.844 --> 00:04:48.016\nthat does therefore mean that, and I know\nwe've talked about this in a previous\n\n88\n00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:52.747\nepisode, that does therefore mean\nthat they can't then do your audit.\n\n89\n00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:57.065\nYou'd have to have a separate\nauditor to do your audit.\n\n90\n00:04:57.065 --> 00:05:00.351\nCuz ethically we don't like to do that.\n\n91\n00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:05.279\n[LAUGH] So you wanna make sure that\nyou've got somebody that comes in and\n\n92\n00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:09.230\nthat can assess exactly\nwhere you are on the path.\n\n93\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.199\nAnd then of course the amount of time is\ngoing to take you then to get to a point\n\n94\n00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.987\nwhere you're able to achieve an ISO 20000\naccreditation, or where you're able for\n\n95\n00:05:17.987 --> 00:05:22.145\nthat assessment to think that you\ncan achieve ISO 20000 accreditation,\n\n96\n00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:23.356\nthat could be months.\n\n97\n00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:26.930\nIt could be a couple of years away, or\nit could be just a couple of weeks away.\n\n98\n00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.200\nSo it really is down to exactly\nwhere you are in terms of\n\n99\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.300\nmaturity of your service\nmanagement processes.\n\n100\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.140\nSo let's take a look at exactly then who\n\n101\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.930\nour accreditation people are and\nwhat about certification, etc.\n\n102\n00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.270\nAccreditation; accreditation\nis recognition by\n\n103\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.570\nan accreditation authority\nthat you are able to\n\n104\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.600\ncarry out a specific service in\naccordance with national standards and\n\n105\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.040\ntechnical regulations described\nin their scope of accreditation.\n\n106\n00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.133\nThere you go.\n\n107\n00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:09.640\nOkay, what exactly does that mean?\n\n108\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.657\nWell, it means that you\nare accredited to ISO 20000.\n\n109\n00:06:12.657 --> 00:06:16.920\nIn other words,\nyou have demonstrated the competence.\n\n110\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.928\nThat's what that means.\n\n111\n00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:22.128\nAnd a national accreditation body, well,\n\n112\n00:06:22.128 --> 00:06:26.972\na national accreditation body\noversees certification bodies and\n\n113\n00:06:26.972 --> 00:06:30.790\nconfirms the certification\nbodies are competent.\n\n114\n00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.810\nAccreditation is something that you\nwant to achieve accreditation, and\n\n115\n00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:43.630\ntherefore you have to get a certification\nbody, somebody who can certificate you.\n\n116\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.245\nYou need to get somebody in to\nactually perform the assessment,\n\n117\n00:06:48.245 --> 00:06:51.416\nto perform the ISO 20000 assessment.\n\n118\n00:06:51.416 --> 00:06:56.365\nSo you need to find\na certification body such as,\n\n119\n00:06:56.365 --> 00:07:01.210\nand we have PEOPLECERT\nthat will perform this.\n\n120\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.448\nYou have APMG, for instance,\ncertification bodies that will come in and\n\n121\n00:07:06.448 --> 00:07:08.904\nwill certify your organization.\n\n122\n00:07:08.904 --> 00:07:13.352\nThis is when your organization\n\n123\n00:07:13.352 --> 00:07:17.980\nwants to achieve ISO 2011.\n\n124\n00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.592\nSo you need to find a certification\nbody such as, per se,\n\n125\n00:07:24.592 --> 00:07:29.380\nPMG or PEOPLECERT to come in and\nactually accredit you and\n\n126\n00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.680\nto ensure that you are able to conform.\n\n127\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.529\nNow that certification body\nhas been accredited themselves\n\n128\n00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:42.483\nas a certification body by\nthe national accreditation body.\n\n129\n00:07:42.483 --> 00:07:43.754\nIt sounds quite complicated but\n\n130\n00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:46.965\nit's not something that you really need\nto bother about too much, to be honest.\n\n131\n00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:50.330\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, I was just kind of wondering\nwhen it comes to, I don't know,\n\n132\n00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.465\nlike licensing model, sometimes they can\nget pretty convoluted especially there\n\n133\n00:07:54.465 --> 00:07:57.950\nare a lot of different ways you can\napproach those licensing models for\n\n134\n00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.568\ninstance.\n\n135\n00:07:58.568 --> 00:08:03.267\nSo when it comes to your accreditation\nIs there kind of a one-size-fits-all\n\n136\n00:08:03.267 --> 00:08:08.210\nprice package, or is that something\nwe should even be worried about?\n\n137\n00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:14.690\n&gt;&gt; Right okay so,\nthere is the actual certification itself.\n\n138\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.564\nThat is down to you and\nyour certification body as to know and\n\n139\n00:08:19.564 --> 00:08:24.444\npricing and and the package\nthat they would choose for you.\n\n140\n00:08:24.444 --> 00:08:27.771\nI mean, that's not something that I can\nsay generically that this is how much\n\n141\n00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:29.660\neverything is going to cost.\n\n142\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.590\nWhat I can tell you is, you're right,\nit's very, very convoluted is that you see\n\n143\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.160\nwe have the International\nStandards Organization, ISO, IEC,\n\n144\n00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.230\nand they will accredit to\nthe national accreditation bodies.\n\n145\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:48.020\nAnd they're national for\neach particular region around the world,\n\n146\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.800\nyou have an accreditation body.\n\n147\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.142\nAnd they are people that will\ncontrol the accreditation.\n\n148\n00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:59.331\nAnd on behalf of that particular country\nand they are the people that control and\n\n149\n00:08:59.331 --> 00:09:03.903\nensure that the certification bodies,\nso auditors, consultants,\n\n150\n00:09:03.903 --> 00:09:09.014\netc., have the right skills to be able\nto come out, and not only assess you but\n\n151\n00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:13.894\nthen also are able to then give you\nthe certification are able to say to you,\n\n152\n00:09:13.894 --> 00:09:16.250\nyes you've passed.\n\n153\n00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:21.930\nSo it's the National Accreditation Bodies\nthat will hold the list of the consultants\n\n154\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.710\nand actual auditors themselves.\n\n155\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.450\nAnd they are the people that actually,\nwell,\n\n156\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.500\nmake sure that everybody knows\nwhat they're talking about.\n\n157\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.870\nAnd that we're able to make\nan assessment on your organization.\n\n158\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.840\nAnd it's at that point in time when you\nsee, and in terms of cost, it's really,\n\n159\n00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.090\nreally difficult because the overall cost,\nit's down to the organization.\n\n160\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.310\nIf you bring in an external consultant\nat the beginning of your project then\n\n161\n00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.830\nobviously your cost is going to be higher.\n\n162\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.970\nAnd it depends on what company that\nyou bring in, or whether you bring in\n\n163\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.350\nan independent consultant as\nto exactly what the costs are.\n\n164\n00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:05.106\nAnd also, that's completely dependent on\nthe scale of the accreditation that you're\n\n165\n00:10:05.106 --> 00:10:05.884\nlooking for.\n\n166\n00:10:05.884 --> 00:10:10.535\nIf you're looking for the achievement\nof ISO 20000 across your entire\n\n167\n00:10:10.535 --> 00:10:15.330\nservice provider organization, and\nyou have got 10,000 people within\n\n168\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.358\nyour service provider organization,\nthen that's going to take some time to do.\n\n169\n00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:22.368\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was thinking about,\nthe scope of and\n\n170\n00:10:22.368 --> 00:10:25.990\ndepending on how many processes you're\ngonna be examining and things like that.\n\n171\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the processes that are gonna be\nexamined are always going to be the same.\n\n172\n00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.966\nWe're going to, in order to achieve\nISO 20000, you've got to show,\n\n173\n00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:37.078\nyou've got to demonstrate,\nthat you have achieved all of\n\n174\n00:10:37.078 --> 00:10:40.271\nthose mandatory requirements for\nall of those processes.\n\n175\n00:10:40.271 --> 00:10:45.410\nSo you can't say, well, I'm going to\naudit all of them except for this one.\n\n176\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.580\nYou can't say that,\n\n177\n00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.420\nyou've got to actually audit all of the\nprocesses that are shown in the part one.\n\n178\n00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.137\nNow if you've got supplemental\ninformation, and again,\n\n179\n00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:58.406\nthis is where an external\nconsultant will help you,\n\n180\n00:10:58.406 --> 00:11:01.768\ncertainly initially as you\nstart off down this road.\n\n181\n00:11:01.768 --> 00:11:04.627\nAn external consultant\nwill help you as to,\n\n182\n00:11:04.627 --> 00:11:07.496\nif you've got supplemental information.\n\n183\n00:11:07.496 --> 00:11:09.888\nThen an external consultant\nwill be the one that says,\n\n184\n00:11:09.888 --> 00:11:13.730\nwell we don't need to include that, or\nyes, we can include that in the scope.\n\n185\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.119\nTo start off with this certification,\n\n186\n00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:23.306\nit's a mine field and\nyou would be better off.\n\n187\n00:11:23.306 --> 00:11:27.860\nMost definitely, you would be better off\nhaving somebody independent come in and\n\n188\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.810\nadvise you, I would never, ever recommend,\nand this is not about revenue generation.\n\n189\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:37.557\nI just would never, ever recommend\nthat you do this on your own\n\n190\n00:11:37.557 --> 00:11:42.396\nbecause it can be a minefield,\nand it seems fairly simple, but\n\n191\n00:11:42.396 --> 00:11:47.808\nwhat exactly we're looking for\nwhen I say, show me is very specific.\n\n192\n00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:51.780\n&gt;&gt; Or at least if that's your first\ntime audit or the first couple of times.\n\n193\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.840\nBut if you had maybe like a senior\ninternal auditor then they would,\n\n194\n00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.900\nas long as they were familiar and\ncomfortable with this process.\n\n195\n00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.602\n&gt;&gt; Well, we would always recommend that\neven an internal auditor, that for\n\n196\n00:12:02.602 --> 00:12:06.723\nthe first time that you do this that you\nbring somebody in who actually understands\n\n197\n00:12:06.723 --> 00:12:07.513\nthe standard.\n\n198\n00:12:07.513 --> 00:12:12.910\nAnd then after that, when you are talking\nabout what I like to call it the top\n\n199\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:19.270\nup audit, then an internal auditor will\nhelp do the internal assessment for that.\n\n200\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.534\nBut suddenly,\nwhen you're starting off down the road,\n\n201\n00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:25.127\nyou really need some advice,\nyou really do.\n\n202\n00:12:25.127 --> 00:12:31.120\nSo, what about the assessment then of\nthe certification bodies themselves?\n\n203\n00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.580\nSo these are the organizations\nsuch as APMG or PeopleCert.\n\n204\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:41.549\nThey must be accredited\nthemselves to ISO 17021,\n\n205\n00:12:41.549 --> 00:12:44.598\nthey have to be accredited.\n\n206\n00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:48.408\nSo when you are looking to\ngain accreditation, and\n\n207\n00:12:48.408 --> 00:12:51.960\nyou are ready to actually\ndo your formal audit.\n\n208\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.228\nThen you need to ensure that\nthe certification body that you\n\n209\n00:12:58.228 --> 00:13:02.275\nare bringing in,\nsuch as IPMG or PeopleCert have\n\n210\n00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:07.130\nachieved the ISO 17021\naccreditation themselves.\n\n211\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:14.390\nThat is a requirement for\nanybody that provides audit certification.\n\n212\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.055\nIf now, these bodies don't\nnecessarily perform consulting and\n\n213\n00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:25.695\nthere is a difference between the two\nbecause it goes back to these ethics\n\n214\n00:13:25.695 --> 00:13:28.752\nconversations that we\nwere having earlier on.\n\n215\n00:13:28.752 --> 00:13:31.633\nFor instance, people said,\ndo not perform consulting.\n\n216\n00:13:31.633 --> 00:13:36.955\nThey don't have any consultants,\nbecause these are ethics\n\n217\n00:13:36.955 --> 00:13:41.909\nthat you don't want a consultant to be-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you don't want to\n\n218\n00:13:41.909 --> 00:13:46.154\nhave any question of where you're just\npaying them off to get the certification,\n\n219\n00:13:46.154 --> 00:13:49.256\ncuz they're not devalues\nthe entire certification process.\n\n220\n00:13:49.256 --> 00:13:51.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a conflict of interest.\n\n221\n00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.866\nSo the assessment,\nactually, this ISO 17021.\n\n222\n00:13:55.866 --> 00:14:02.293\nThat particular assessment just covers\nhow well the auditors understand Part 1,\n\n223\n00:14:02.293 --> 00:14:07.940\nand how competent the auditors\nare on actual certification itself.\n\n224\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.180\nSo we would always recommend, and, I mean,\n\n225\n00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.030\na lot of organizations that I've\nworked with to achieve ISO 20000,\n\n226\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:20.110\nthese organizations will employ\na separate consultancy firm.\n\n227\n00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.310\nAnd then some global\norganizations that will\n\n228\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.390\nemploy a separate consultancy firm,\nand we will come in and\n\n229\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.690\nwe will do the consultancy and\nwe will make recommendations.\n\n230\n00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:34.930\nAnd it could be up to,\nin one organization that I've worked with,\n\n231\n00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:39.187\nit was about a two year process\nin order to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n232\n00:14:39.187 --> 00:14:43.622\nAnd that's from the initial yes, we want\nthat certification right the way through\n\n233\n00:14:43.622 --> 00:14:46.280\nto actually achieving the certification.\n\n234\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.753\nAnd the good thing about having\nthe independent consultants around is that\n\n235\n00:14:50.753 --> 00:14:55.368\nan independent consultant will not only\nbe able to work with the auditor, but\n\n236\n00:14:55.368 --> 00:14:58.365\nthey'll speak the same\nlanguage as the auditor.\n\n237\n00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:02.242\nAnd an independent consultant can\nget to know your organization and\n\n238\n00:15:02.242 --> 00:15:06.459\nthen can translate your organizational\nperformance into a language that\n\n239\n00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:09.080\nthe auditor can understand.\n\n240\n00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.130\nAnd that's something that you then expect\nyour internal auditor to sit in on and\n\n241\n00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.840\nyour internal auditor to be involved in.\n\n242\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.790\nSo that the next time you have your full\nassessment audit, in three years time,\n\n243\n00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.320\nthen that internal auditor\ncan perform that role.\n\n244\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:29.710\nBut it's worthy investment, right at\nthe very beginning, put it that way, okay?\n\n245\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.964\nThat's what I would say, but\nthat's completely up to you.\n\n246\n00:15:32.964 --> 00:15:34.147\nIn my experience, or\n\n247\n00:15:34.147 --> 00:15:38.106\nit's not a mandatory requirement to\nbring somebody else in external.\n\n248\n00:15:38.106 --> 00:15:43.287\nI have not come across an organization\nthat has managed to achieve ISO\n\n249\n00:15:43.287 --> 00:15:48.400\n20000 accreditation without\nusing an external consultant.\n\n250\n00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's just in my experience.\n\n251\n00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.160\nSo I can't tell you the right or wrong,\nit's not a mandatory requirement.\n\n252\n00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.001\nBut certainly,\n\n253\n00:15:54.001 --> 00:15:58.094\nI've never come across anybody that\nhas achieved ISO 20000 without that.\n\n254\n00:15:58.094 --> 00:16:00.741\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n255\n00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:06.643\n&gt;&gt; So your certificate will last three\nyears before a full re-audit and\n\n256\n00:16:06.643 --> 00:16:09.806\nit says normally lasts three years.\n\n257\n00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:17.198\nTake a look at clause 17021,\nthe audit program.\n\n258\n00:16:17.198 --> 00:16:21.385\nSo the certificate ISO 17021,\n\n259\n00:16:21.385 --> 00:16:24.897\nthat applies to the auditor and\n\n260\n00:16:24.897 --> 00:16:30.040\nthe auditor's organization should we say.\n\n261\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.873\nThis is where it gets quite difficult,\nokay.\n\n262\n00:16:33.873 --> 00:16:37.700\nSo ISO 17021, let's say I'm an auditor.\n\n263\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.275\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n264\n00:16:38.275 --> 00:16:42.252\n&gt;&gt; And I am auditing you for ISO 20000.\n\n265\n00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.396\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nOkay?\n\n266\n00:16:43.396 --> 00:16:49.835\nSo I have to abide by these rules, and the\nrules I have to abide by are ISO 17021,\n\n267\n00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:54.389\nthat first one,\nis that I can audit you initially, right?\n\n268\n00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:59.461\nIt will be a two-stage initial audit,\nso I'll come in first of I'll\n\n269\n00:16:59.461 --> 00:17:04.884\nsay to you very simply, okay,\nhere's your non-conformance issues and\n\n270\n00:17:04.884 --> 00:17:10.131\nI give you the opportunity to address\nthose non-conformance issues,\n\n271\n00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:14.520\nand then I'll come back in\nwhatever period we've agreed.\n\n272\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.320\nAnd then I'll come back and\nI'll say, okay,\n\n273\n00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.319\nhave you addressed\nthe non-conformance issues?\n\n274\n00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:23.448\nShow me that you've addressed them,\nthen I give you the certificate, then we\n\n275\n00:17:23.448 --> 00:17:28.906\nconduct a surveillance audit at least once\na year, so at least once a year I come in.\n\n276\n00:17:28.906 --> 00:17:33.303\n&gt;&gt; Now is this like a surprise visit or\nis it scheduled?\n\n277\n00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:35.125\n[LAUGH] Am I allowed to ask that question?\n\n278\n00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:37.931\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's go over that.\n\n279\n00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:39.176\nNo, it should be scheduled.\n\n280\n00:17:39.176 --> 00:17:41.782\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But it's not an optional thing.\n\n281\n00:17:41.782 --> 00:17:43.365\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n282\n00:17:43.365 --> 00:17:44.390\n&gt;&gt; You don't get the choice.\n\n283\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.389\nYou don't get to say, no, I don't want it.\n\n284\n00:17:46.389 --> 00:17:48.057\nPut it that way, okay?\n\n285\n00:17:48.057 --> 00:17:52.853\nSo then within the first 12 months\nI'm gonna say to you, Cherokee,\n\n286\n00:17:52.853 --> 00:17:57.582\nI need to come in next week and\ndo another surveillance audit for you.\n\n287\n00:17:57.582 --> 00:18:01.120\nNow I'm not going to turn around and\nsay to you,\n\n288\n00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.380\nI'm coming in tomorrow, but\nI am gonna give you notice.\n\n289\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.112\nBut nevertheless, I still need to\nensure at least once a year we have\n\n290\n00:18:10.112 --> 00:18:15.094\na surveillance audit, and that\nsurveillance audit will make sure that\n\n291\n00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:19.507\nyou are keeping up to speed with\neverything that's required.\n\n292\n00:18:19.507 --> 00:18:20.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n293\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:26.690\n&gt;&gt; And therefore I can highlight any\nsort of minor non-conformities that\n\n294\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.915\nyou may have where I will say to you\nthis needs to be dealt with, and\n\n295\n00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:37.805\nthen after three years, on the third year,\nit will be a full re-audit and\n\n296\n00:18:37.805 --> 00:18:41.995\na full re-audit includes\nabsolutely everything.\n\n297\n00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:48.148\nAnd at that point in time if\nthere are any non-conformities,\n\n298\n00:18:48.148 --> 00:18:53.370\nthen you don't retain your ISO 20000,\nokay.\n\n299\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:58.483\nSo the APMG is a national\naccreditation body\n\n300\n00:18:58.483 --> 00:19:03.739\nhere within the US and\nwithin Europe as well.\n\n301\n00:19:03.739 --> 00:19:08.811\nAnd they will approve the registered\ncertification bodies to\n\n302\n00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:16.720\nbe able to use not only the APMG logo, but\nalso the ISO 20000 accreditation as well.\n\n303\n00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.888\nAnd of course as we've already said,\n\n304\n00:19:19.888 --> 00:19:25.828\nthe auditing bodies themselves\nmust be accredited to ISO 17021,\n\n305\n00:19:25.828 --> 00:19:30.390\nand APMG will check that as well,\nthey really do okay.\n\n306\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.796\nSo this is just really an assurance that\nthe people that are coming out to do\n\n307\n00:19:34.796 --> 00:19:37.178\nthe audit can officially\n&gt;&gt; They're legitimate.\n\n308\n00:19:37.178 --> 00:19:42.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're legitimate and they can\nofficially give you that certification.\n\n309\n00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.444\nIt's not just somebody else\nthat's just coming in and\n\n310\n00:19:45.444 --> 00:19:48.710\nsaying, yeah you're doing\nreally well in that system.\n\n311\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n312\n00:19:49.913 --> 00:19:52.162\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's okay.\n\n313\n00:19:52.162 --> 00:19:54.840\nYou've got that assurance there, okay.\n\n314\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.188\nSo here we have then you've got\nyour initial certification audit.\n\n315\n00:19:58.188 --> 00:20:00.678\nThese are the types of\naudit that you can have and\n\n316\n00:20:00.678 --> 00:20:05.210\nyour initial certification audit it is\nconducted by the accreditation body.\n\n317\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:12.527\nAnd that's your first assessment that says\nyes, okay, you have achieved ISO 20000.\n\n318\n00:20:12.527 --> 00:20:13.027\nYes or no, okay?\n\n319\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.828\nAnd that's in two stages because we're\ngonna identify any non-conformities\n\n320\n00:20:21.828 --> 00:20:26.156\nfirst of all and then we will give you\nthe actual certificate at the end of\n\n321\n00:20:26.156 --> 00:20:27.330\nthe second stage.\n\n322\n00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.010\nAnd then your recertification,\n\n323\n00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.699\nthat happens well after your\nfirst initial assessment and\n\n324\n00:20:34.699 --> 00:20:39.205\nthen every three years you\nwill have recertification.\n\n325\n00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:42.445\nBut every year you will have\nthe surveillance audit and\n\n326\n00:20:42.445 --> 00:20:45.980\nas it says, it's carried out\nby that certification body.\n\n327\n00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:52.667\nSo this is not something that's\ncarried out by an internal auditor.\n\n328\n00:20:52.667 --> 00:20:55.444\nIt's carried out by\nthe certification body.\n\n329\n00:20:55.444 --> 00:20:58.587\nNow what we would recommend this that you\n\n330\n00:20:58.587 --> 00:21:03.308\nhave an internal auditor to\nactually audit you internally.\n\n331\n00:21:03.308 --> 00:21:07.748\nAs it says here, the self assessment\nconducted by the service provider,\n\n332\n00:21:07.748 --> 00:21:12.046\nthe person who's looking to achieve\nISO 20000, then I would look\n\n333\n00:21:12.046 --> 00:21:16.934\nto maybe have an internal auditor who's\ngoing to be on a regular basis checking.\n\n334\n00:21:16.934 --> 00:21:20.040\n&gt;&gt; And like you said, and this is\nsomething that if I have someone and\n\n335\n00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.317\nthat maybe that is their full-time job,\nthey can keep an eye on it and\n\n336\n00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:26.482\nnot just rushing to the last minute\nbecause that's gonna be kind of\n\n337\n00:21:26.482 --> 00:21:28.877\nobvious whenever the actual\naudit is happening.\n\n338\n00:21:28.877 --> 00:21:32.557\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou can have that first party audit,\n\n339\n00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:36.250\nyou can have an external\nconsultant to do that.\n\n340\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.426\nAnd certainly for, as I've already said,\nand I'm not gonna [INAUDIBLE] that point,\n\n341\n00:21:40.426 --> 00:21:43.558\ncertainly for the sake of the first\ntime that you try and do this,\n\n342\n00:21:43.558 --> 00:21:45.947\nyou'd bring in an external\nconsultant as well.\n\n343\n00:21:45.947 --> 00:21:52.160\nAnd you also have a third party audit too,\nwhich is the certification body.\n\n344\n00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.422\nNow, the certification body\ncan actually come in and\n\n345\n00:21:56.422 --> 00:22:01.259\ndo an independent audit outside\nof the surveillance audit.\n\n346\n00:22:01.259 --> 00:22:05.200\nThat's not probably gonna be cheap,\nbut they can do that.\n\n347\n00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.598\nThere's always a weariness.\n\n348\n00:22:06.598 --> 00:22:11.662\nNow, the certification body themselves\nare going to remain completely impartial,\n\n349\n00:22:11.662 --> 00:22:16.443\nand there's always a weariness within\nthis that that's going to influence your\n\n350\n00:22:16.443 --> 00:22:18.782\nactual performance at the real audit.\n\n351\n00:22:18.782 --> 00:22:21.047\nSo a lot of organizations\ndon't like to do that,\n\n352\n00:22:21.047 --> 00:22:23.757\nbring the certification body in early and\nsay, hey look,\n\n353\n00:22:23.757 --> 00:22:26.710\ncan you assess this,\nbecause that might influence the audit.\n\n354\n00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.608\n&gt;&gt; And also,\nyou wanna put your best foot forward,\n\n355\n00:22:28.608 --> 00:22:30.054\nat least that's what I would think.\n\n356\n00:22:30.054 --> 00:22:33.451\nYou don't wanna have that\nkind of tarnished reputation.\n\n357\n00:22:33.451 --> 00:22:40.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, right and I think\nit's down to you as an organization.\n\n358\n00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.553\nI wouldn't say that there's\nany recommendation either way.\n\n359\n00:22:43.553 --> 00:22:49.281\nAnd I know that we work well with the\ncertification auditors when they'll come\n\n360\n00:22:49.281 --> 00:22:55.205\nin, and they're incredibly independent and\ngenerally really professional.\n\n361\n00:22:55.205 --> 00:22:59.214\nAnd I've never known it influence\nan organization in the past, but\n\n362\n00:22:59.214 --> 00:23:02.870\nI understand that there's\na wariness there in doing that, so\n\n363\n00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.285\nI wouldn't worry too much about that.\n\n364\n00:23:05.285 --> 00:23:07.148\nYou can do that.\n\n365\n00:23:07.148 --> 00:23:08.957\nThat's completely up to you, again.\n\n366\n00:23:08.957 --> 00:23:11.983\nAnd then you've got a second party audit,\nand\n\n367\n00:23:11.983 --> 00:23:15.800\nthat's an audit by somebody\nthat has a user interest.\n\n368\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.200\nSo let's say that you have\nan external customer, for instance,\n\n369\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.440\nwho's got a vested interest\nin you achieving ISO 20000,\n\n370\n00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.371\nthen they might come in and\ndo a preparation audit for you.\n\n371\n00:23:28.371 --> 00:23:29.807\nThat's another possibility.\n\n372\n00:23:29.807 --> 00:23:34.070\nThat's something that can happen and\nagain, right or wrong,\n\n373\n00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.410\nthat is really entirely up to you.\n\n374\n00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.892\nSo what you have to do then\nwhen you're arranging for\n\n375\n00:23:41.892 --> 00:23:46.033\nyour ISO 20000 audit,\nyou have to select an independent\n\n376\n00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:49.951\naudit company to assess your\nservice management system.\n\n377\n00:23:49.951 --> 00:23:53.803\nYou have to select\nan independent consultancy firm,\n\n378\n00:23:53.803 --> 00:23:58.767\na consultant to come in and\nassess your service management system And\n\n379\n00:23:58.767 --> 00:24:03.404\nthen you're going to decide on\nyour certification intervals.\n\n380\n00:24:03.404 --> 00:24:08.870\nSo your surveillance audits could be every\nsix months, or they could be annually.\n\n381\n00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.986\nYour re-certification is going\nto be every three years, and\n\n382\n00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:18.049\nthen you have to think about what you're\ngoing to do with nonconformities,\n\n383\n00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:22.954\nand I know that in a previous episode\nI talked about nonconformities, and\n\n384\n00:24:22.954 --> 00:24:27.859\nabout the fact that, when you're\ndoing this internally, internally,\n\n385\n00:24:27.859 --> 00:24:32.685\nyou're really going to be trying to\npass the audit, and so internally,\n\n386\n00:24:32.685 --> 00:24:36.923\nyou might not necessarily have\nthe impartiality internally.\n\n387\n00:24:36.923 --> 00:24:41.716\nYou can identity noncomformities, and\nthis is why we will always say to you,\n\n388\n00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:46.070\nbring somebody in external,\ncertainly right at the very beginning,\n\n389\n00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.150\nbecause an external person can\nadd that impartiality into that.\n\n390\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.233\nThey'll give you that unbiased view,\nand the inter,\n\n391\n00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:59.205\nthe external consultant can also\nengage with the auditor as well,\n\n392\n00:24:59.205 --> 00:25:04.030\nand a lot of external consultants\nwon't do that on your behalf.\n\n393\n00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.779\nAs I've already said,\nthey speak the same language.\n\n394\n00:25:05.779 --> 00:25:06.630\nSo why not?\n\n395\n00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:11.581\nLet's do that, and then,\nwe take a look at Part 1, And Part 1,\n\n396\n00:25:11.581 --> 00:25:14.461\nwe have to be able to apply Part 1, and\n\n397\n00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:18.352\nthat last bullet point in\nthere is very important.\n\n398\n00:25:18.352 --> 00:25:24.816\nYou can not exclude any of those\nrequirements that are in Clauses 4 to 9.\n\n399\n00:25:24.816 --> 00:25:25.950\nYou can't do that.\n\n400\n00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:32.423\nPart 1 is not a standard for\nproducts, or services, or for\n\n401\n00:25:32.423 --> 00:25:38.933\nthe organization, but Part 1 is\neverything that you have to achieve.\n\n402\n00:25:38.933 --> 00:25:42.681\nAnd I like the interesting point there\nthat says that you do not need to own\n\n403\n00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:43.860\nthe infrastructure.\n\n404\n00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.235\nThe technology doesn't have to be yours.\n\n405\n00:25:47.235 --> 00:25:52.313\nYou can still achieve ISO 20000,\nbecause what we're auditing against,\n\n406\n00:25:52.313 --> 00:25:57.050\nwe are auditing against your ability\nto manage the infrastructure.\n\n407\n00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.510\nWe are not auditing\nthe infrastructure itself.\n\n408\n00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.410\nBut these requirements, well,\nyou have to meet them all.\n\n409\n00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:11.558\nIn order to pass the order you have to\nmeet them all, and the first thing that\n\n410\n00:26:11.558 --> 00:26:16.458\nyou have to do is, you have to set\na scope, and your scope is the scope for\n\n411\n00:26:16.458 --> 00:26:22.178\nthe actual audit itself, in other words\nwhat processes you're going to include,\n\n412\n00:26:22.178 --> 00:26:26.918\nwhat documentation you're going\nto include, what about skills and\n\n413\n00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:31.450\ntraining of stuff, don't forget,\nthey're included as well.\n\n414\n00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:36.773\nYour organization has\nto be a legal entity.\n\n415\n00:26:36.773 --> 00:26:42.439\nSo in other words, you have to have\na registered company, and whatever country\n\n416\n00:26:42.439 --> 00:26:47.767\nyou are located in you have to have\na registered company, and a certificate\n\n417\n00:26:47.767 --> 00:26:53.330\nwill not be awarded to anybody that\nare formed from lots of legal entities.\n\n418\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.260\nSo a partnership, for instance,\n\n419\n00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.970\nyou are not going to be awarded\na certificate across a partnership.\n\n420\n00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.580\nThe certificate will be\nawarded to one legal entity.\n\n421\n00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.567\nEven though maybe the processes\nthemselves are spread across to\n\n422\n00:27:09.567 --> 00:27:14.737\norganizations, nevertheless,\nno that's not going to happen,\n\n423\n00:27:14.737 --> 00:27:19.279\nit's going to be awarded to just one,\nnot to both of them.\n\n424\n00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:24.216\nThat's something that's worth bearing in\nmind, because when we talk about software\n\n425\n00:27:24.216 --> 00:27:28.609\nas a service, and when we talk about\nthe fact that a lot of organizations now,\n\n426\n00:27:28.609 --> 00:27:33.479\nwe'll outsource, and we'll use one service\nprovider to provide us with one thing,\n\n427\n00:27:33.479 --> 00:27:38.077\nand somebody else to provide us with\nsomething else, then if you're looking for\n\n428\n00:27:38.077 --> 00:27:41.036\nISO 20000 accreditation-\n&gt;&gt; You can't share that.\n\n429\n00:27:41.036 --> 00:27:42.519\n&gt;&gt; You can't share it with anybody, no.\n\n430\n00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:43.460\nThat's yours.\n\n431\n00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.370\nYou cannot share it with anyone at all.\n\n432\n00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.930\nIn terms of the governance of\nthe processes for form clause 4,\n\n433\n00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.830\nwell, you have to ensure,\n\n434\n00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.570\nwhen we look at third parties, and\njust while we're talking about this,\n\n435\n00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.870\nwhen we look at third parties, if a third\nparty were outsourcing something and\n\n436\n00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.560\nthey're providing a service for\nus, then we own that.\n\n437\n00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.220\nWe own that process, and we own that\nservice, and we own the processes and\n\n438\n00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:13.410\nthe policies to manage that, and\nthat's what you will be audited against.\n\n439\n00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.890\nSo that means that you are responsible for\nwhat they're doing, and if what they're\n\n440\n00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:24.400\nproducing is not conformant to ISO 20000,\nthen you won't achieve your audit.\n\n441\n00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.860\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n442\n00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.495\nSo you have to make sure that what\nthey're doing is going to allow you to\n\n443\n00:28:30.495 --> 00:28:35.604\nachieve ISO 20000, because if what\nyou're doing isn't going to allow\n\n444\n00:28:35.604 --> 00:28:40.557\nyou to achieve ISO 20,000 leave it\nto nonconformity that it's quite\n\n445\n00:28:40.557 --> 00:28:45.615\nsimply a nonconformity, and\nyou're not going to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n446\n00:28:45.615 --> 00:28:49.060\nSo just before we start to\ntake a look at evidence, and\n\n447\n00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.351\nwe're going to take a look\nat that in our next show,\n\n448\n00:28:52.351 --> 00:28:57.787\nwe're just going to call that a wrap for\nthis particular show, and we'll carry on,\n\n449\n00:28:57.787 --> 00:29:01.945\nand look in at all the evidence\nthat you need in our next episode.\n\n450\n00:29:01.945 --> 00:29:04.442\n&gt;&gt; All right, and just like Jo said,\nlooks like that's a wrap.\n\n451\n00:29:04.442 --> 00:29:06.259\nSo, thank you for joining us here.\n\n452\n00:29:06.259 --> 00:29:08.648\nLet's stay tuned,\nwe're not finished quite yet.\n\n453\n00:29:08.648 --> 00:29:10.067\nFor this show, we'll sign out.\n\n454\n00:29:10.067 --> 00:29:11.722\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n455\n00:29:11.722 --> 00:29:12.484\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n456\n00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:14.493\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n457\n00:29:14.493 --> 00:29:20.392\n[MUSIC]\n\n458\n00:29:20.392 --> 00:29:23.560\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.342\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:11.975\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.975 --> 00:00:17.425\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your ISO/IEC\n20000 2011 Foundation Series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:19.910\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.165\nIn the last episode we were looking at the\nauditing and certification process, and\n\n8\n00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:25.823\nwe're not quite finished yet.\n\n9\n00:00:25.823 --> 00:00:29.760\nSo back in the studio with us today\nwe have ISO expert Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.360\nThanks for joining us Jo.\n\n11\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.080\n&gt;&gt; It's great to be here Cherokee,\nhow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.827\n&gt;&gt; I am doing excellent thank you for\nasking.\n\n13\n00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:39.623\nWe started going through that\nprocess of what to expect.\n\n14\n00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.146\nWell, we had already gone\nthrough all the clauses, and\n\n15\n00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.110\nwe have that good understanding now,\nbut what's left to cover?\n\n16\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.433\n&gt;&gt; Really what we're covering\nin this particular section,\n\n17\n00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.966\nthis is just a Part 2 of\nour previous episode.\n\n18\n00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:56.723\nAnd we're just carrying on with\nthe exact audit process, really,\n\n19\n00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.904\nand exactly what to\nexpect during the audit.\n\n20\n00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:04.168\nWe've already, as you've seen, gone\nthrough in previous episode what clauses\n\n21\n00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:07.900\nwe need to cover, and also what\ndocumentation that we need to produce.\n\n22\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.900\nAnd so here we're just having, well,\nkind of a refresher, but more importantly\n\n23\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.340\nthis is just an overview of what\nthe auditor is going to ask of you.\n\n24\n00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.920\nAnd how the process is going to go,\nwhat's gonna happen at the end of it.\n\n25\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.264\nSo in Part 1, we just looked\nat the frequency of audits and\n\n26\n00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:28.401\nwho can get to do your audit.\n\n27\n00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:33.874\nAnd well the relevance of bringing in\nan external consultant to help you.\n\n28\n00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:38.640\nCertainly the first time that you try, or\nonce you've made the decision to try and\n\n29\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.174\nachieve ISO 20000.\n\n30\n00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:44.961\nAnd so now we're just gonna look a little\nbit more in depth at the evidence\n\n31\n00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:46.463\nthat you can provide.\n\n32\n00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:50.986\nWhat can be submitted and what can't\nbe submitted, and also the scope,\n\n33\n00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:53.210\netc of the actual audit itself.\n\n34\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.744\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan.\n\n35\n00:01:54.744 --> 00:01:56.294\n&gt;&gt; Right, well then well we better get\n\n36\n00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:57.023\ngoing then say-\n\n37\n00:01:57.023 --> 00:01:58.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n38\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.450\n&gt;&gt; That's it, sounds like a plan\nall right well then, [LAUGH] Well,\n\n39\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.590\nlet's take a look then at our Part 1 then,\nthe evidence then here for Part 1.\n\n40\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.300\nSo we've been through, in previous\nsessions we've been through all of\n\n41\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.020\nthe mandatory requirements which is the,\nyou shall produce this and\n\n42\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.680\nyou want to see evidence of relationships,\netc.\n\n43\n00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.050\nSo what do I want to see?\n\n44\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.610\nWell, generically for\nevery single process,\n\n45\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.310\nwe've got to see accountability for\neach process.\n\n46\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.360\nAnd this is evidence required for\nconformity to Clause 4,\n\n47\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.960\nnow if you remember Clause 4,\nwas the service management system.\n\n48\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.144\nA service management system\nwas all about the policies and\n\n49\n00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:43.644\nprocesses, and the management of IT.\n\n50\n00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:45.020\nSo what does this really mean?\n\n51\n00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.723\nWell, what it means is that every\nprocess has to have a process owner.\n\n52\n00:02:50.723 --> 00:02:53.624\nEvery process has to be documented,\n\n53\n00:02:53.624 --> 00:02:58.410\nevery process has to be\nsubject to version control.\n\n54\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.820\nEvery process has to be subject\nto continual improvement.\n\n55\n00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.090\nWhat does that actually mean?\n\n56\n00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.769\nWell, first a start,\nI don't care what you call your processes.\n\n57\n00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.949\nBut, I do care that you've got processes\nthat cover things like incident and\n\n58\n00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.813\nproblem management and that you understand\nthe difference between the two.\n\n59\n00:03:21.813 --> 00:03:25.459\nI do care that you have\na process that covers\n\n60\n00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.438\nthe change of anything to do\nwith your IT infrastructure.\n\n61\n00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:34.596\nI do care that you have a process to\ncome about configuration management and\n\n62\n00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:38.410\nI do care that you have service\nlevel management in place.\n\n63\n00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.495\nWhat you call those\nprocesses I don't care.\n\n64\n00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:46.580\nI do care that you have an owner\nthat's defined for each process.\n\n65\n00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.520\nSo in the process documentation,\nI want to see a revision history.\n\n66\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.227\nI'm probably going to ask to see all\nthe versions of the processes is two.\n\n67\n00:03:57.227 --> 00:04:01.159\nI'm gonna want to see that\nyou have a process owner, and\n\n68\n00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.098\nthat processor is documented within\nthe process documentation, and\n\n69\n00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:11.470\nI might even want to speak with that\nprocess owner each individual process.\n\n70\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.983\nI'm going to want to see that\npart of your process details what\n\n71\n00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:21.221\nto do when you've identified\nan improvement opportunity.\n\n72\n00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:25.710\nI'm going to ask to see\nspecific procedures to do with\n\n73\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.600\ncertain process activities.\n\n74\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.927\nSo I might ask to see work instructions.\n\n75\n00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:39.793\nWhat I need to see is all of the evidence\nto do with all of the processes that tells\n\n76\n00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:47.040\nme whether a process as an owner that\ntells me whether a process has activity.\n\n77\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.180\nIt tells me that you understand\nthe defined inputs to a process and\n\n78\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.740\nyou understand what outputs you expect\nfrom a process, and that you know\n\n79\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.890\nwhat to do in a process doesn't quite turn\nout the way that you expected it to do.\n\n80\n00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.570\nI'm also looking for\nevidence that processes are followed.\n\n81\n00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.900\nSo again I'm looking for\nevidence what to do in an exception,\n\n82\n00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.870\nwhat to do when somebody doesn't\nfollow the changed management process.\n\n83\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.234\nNow remember the things that we talked\nabout earlier on about making the decision\n\n84\n00:05:22.234 --> 00:05:23.851\nfor change management as to.\n\n85\n00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:28.239\nDo we allow the service test update\nconfiguration management system or\n\n86\n00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:32.270\ndo we insist that it goes through\nthe change management process?\n\n87\n00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.745\nAll of those decisions, there have to be\ndocuments it's part of the policies and\n\n88\n00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:40.965\nthe guidances for IT service management.\n\n89\n00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:45.705\nSo I want to make sure that we've got\nall of that control documented and\n\n90\n00:05:45.705 --> 00:05:49.995\nthat you're able to prioritize\nnot only process improvements but\n\n91\n00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:52.695\nprioritize within the processes\nthemselves as well.\n\n92\n00:05:53.695 --> 00:05:57.490\nSo, we've seen in service\nlevel management that we have\n\n93\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.520\nprioritization tables that are contained\nwithin the service level agreement.\n\n94\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.716\nAnd those prioritization tables apply to\nincidents, and they apply to changes,\n\n95\n00:06:07.716 --> 00:06:12.475\nand they apply to problems, and\nthey apply to requests, etc, etc, etc.\n\n96\n00:06:12.475 --> 00:06:17.173\nHowever, it's not impossible that\nyou will get a number of priority\n\n97\n00:06:17.173 --> 00:06:22.160\nthree incidents opened at the same time,\nso how do you prioritize?\n\n98\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.564\nWell, I'd expect you, if they're all\na priority three, I would expect you to\n\n99\n00:06:26.564 --> 00:06:30.201\nprioritize them based on time,\nthe one that was opened soonest.\n\n100\n00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:31.787\nBut you might not do that, so\n\n101\n00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:35.960\nI want to see evidence of how you\nactually prioritize your incidents.\n\n102\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.780\n&gt;&gt; So as long as there is some kind\nof triage methodology in place.\n\n103\n00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.479\nLike, however many people it's affecting\nas far as being out of production, and\n\n104\n00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:44.100\nso forth.\n\n105\n00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.316\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but it's not enough for\nyou to tell me that yes,\n\n106\n00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:51.000\nit's okay because Justin\nknows what he's doing.\n\n107\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.230\nWell for start Justin doesn't\nknow what he's doing but anyway.\n\n108\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.037\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:06:54.037 --> 00:06:54.841\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell him that.\n\n110\n00:06:54.841 --> 00:06:59.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No no okay yes we just\nhad this discussion with him.\n\n111\n00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.750\nBut it's not enough for you to say to me,\n\n112\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.610\nno that's okay Justin\nknows what he's doing.\n\n113\n00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.710\nI want to see where it's documented,\nbecause what if Justin wasn't around and\n\n114\n00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.640\nRonnie had to do something that day.\n\n115\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.049\nRonnie wouldn't know what to do, and\nhe wouldn't know how to prioritize.\n\n116\n00:07:12.049 --> 00:07:15.957\nSo this evidence,\nit's got to be documentary evidence.\n\n117\n00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:22.180\nAnd I know that I said time and time\nagain, show me, but you have to see this.\n\n118\n00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.440\nIt has to be shown,\nit has to be given to the auditor,\n\n119\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.300\nwe have to have that documentary evidence.\n\n120\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.620\nNow you can have it within a process for\nyour tool and that's okay.\n\n121\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.390\nBut at some point in time,\nyou must have configured your tool.\n\n122\n00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.020\nI want to see the configuration\nof your tool then.\n\n123\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.590\nIf it's all contained in the tool and\nthe tool is automating this,\n\n124\n00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.418\nthere still has to be a documented\nprocess that the tool will perform.\n\n125\n00:07:49.418 --> 00:07:54.397\nSo even where it's automated even where\nyou've got it all facilitating this,\n\n126\n00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:57.232\nthere still has to be\ndocumentary evidence.\n\n127\n00:07:57.232 --> 00:08:01.451\nAnd you can have additional evidence\nsuch as your catalogue of services\n\n128\n00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:05.815\nThe individual service level agreements\nthat contain the service levels\n\n129\n00:08:05.815 --> 00:08:06.670\ntargets etc.\n\n130\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:13.340\nExternal documents such as documents for\nthe use of the tool.\n\n131\n00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.220\nDocuments that will tell me what specific\nprocesses are and specific plans, and\n\n132\n00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.230\nspecific procedures and work instructions.\n\n133\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.740\nI want to see documentation\nthat shows me the integration.\n\n134\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.668\nSo, for instance,\na service level agreement.\n\n135\n00:08:28.668 --> 00:08:32.237\nA service level agreement is a document\nthat our customers sign, yes?\n\n136\n00:08:32.237 --> 00:08:35.852\nIt's an agreement between IT and\nthe service provider.\n\n137\n00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:39.541\nBut what do with that\nservice level document?\n\n138\n00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:45.532\nIs it a document that we keep in our\ndocument repository management system?\n\n139\n00:08:45.532 --> 00:08:50.783\nIs it a document that we put into\nSharePoint, or is it actually a document\n\n140\n00:08:50.783 --> 00:08:56.960\nthat we keep in SharePoint and a record\nthat we create in our core logging tool?\n\n141\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:02.380\nSo that when we create a record that\nrecord, that service level record contains\n\n142\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:08.315\nall of the operational hours,\nthe release windows, the change freezes.\n\n143\n00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:12.440\nThat contains the target resolution for\n\n144\n00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.000\npriorities one sort of priorities four or\nfive or whatever you might call for\n\n145\n00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.190\nincident management, the target\nresolution times, or response times.\n\n146\n00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.781\nThe problem management and\nthe target resolution times or\n\n147\n00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:29.084\nimplementation times would\nchange management etc.\n\n148\n00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:34.929\nBecause you see if you imput this into the\ntool, then its automatically then related\n\n149\n00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:40.050\nto the incidents, and the problems,\nand the changes, and the request.\n\n150\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.180\nSo how is your service\nlevel management perform?\n\n151\n00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.236\nIs it performed using just the document,\nor\n\n152\n00:09:48.236 --> 00:09:52.294\nis it actually performed to\nmanage using the tool itself?\n\n153\n00:09:52.294 --> 00:09:54.250\nThat's the supplementary information.\n\n154\n00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.300\nThat's the evidence that I want to see.\n\n155\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.230\nThat's what we mean by show me.\n\n156\n00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.830\nJust because you've gone and\n\n157\n00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:08.024\nbought a tool off the shelf doesn't mean\nthat you have complied with ISO 20000.\n\n158\n00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:12.587\nAnd I know that I've said this in\nthe past when it comes to ITIL, but\n\n159\n00:10:12.587 --> 00:10:18.473\nthere's no such thing as ITIL compliant,\nbecause ITIL is well, it's a framework.\n\n160\n00:10:18.473 --> 00:10:19.081\n&gt;&gt; A framework.\n\n161\n00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:23.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that you will adapt\nto suit your environment.\n\n162\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.045\nThere is such a thing\nas achieving ISO 20000.\n\n163\n00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:32.851\nBut however,\nbecause you implement your own proprietary\n\n164\n00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:37.763\nversion of a framework in\norder to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n165\n00:10:37.763 --> 00:10:42.363\nThen a tool can't be ISO 20000\ncompliant either because ISO\n\n166\n00:10:42.363 --> 00:10:47.460\n20000 will look different for\neach organization as well.\n\n167\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:53.175\nCuz that's obviously going to be based\non your ability to manage your services,\n\n168\n00:10:53.175 --> 00:10:57.360\ni.e., the efficiency and\nthe effectiveness of your framework.\n\n169\n00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.742\nSo when it comes to anybody trying\nto claim that their tool is ITIL or\n\n170\n00:11:02.742 --> 00:11:06.280\nISO 20000 compliant then\nthere's no such thing.\n\n171\n00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:12.505\nI can tell you however,\nthat there is an organization out there\n\n172\n00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:17.133\nin the big wide world that will\nprovide an audit for tools.\n\n173\n00:11:17.133 --> 00:11:24.088\nThat will ordered against the tools\nability to support an ITIL framework.\n\n174\n00:11:24.088 --> 00:11:29.414\nAnd Pink Elephant do what we call\na PinkVERIFY and this can be Googled,\n\n175\n00:11:29.414 --> 00:11:33.400\nPinkVERIFY audit for\nservice management tool set.\n\n176\n00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.430\nAnd if you take a look at the PinkVERIFY\nwebsite, then it will give you\n\n177\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.287\na list of tools that are available\nout there in the big wide world and\n\n178\n00:11:43.287 --> 00:11:48.058\nit will tell you what processes\nare are deemed to be supportable or\n\n179\n00:11:48.058 --> 00:11:51.770\nrather supporting of\nthe ITIL based framework.\n\n180\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.720\nAnd I have worked with a number of\ntool manufacturers Actually to ensure\n\n181\n00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.950\nthat their tools are able to support\nITIL framework and ITIL based framework.\n\n182\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.590\nSo that's something that you can use,\n\n183\n00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:08.000\nit's something that's available\nto you that you can keep in your,\n\n184\n00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.660\nI don't know in your little-\n&gt;&gt; Repertoire.\n\n185\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.373\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just something that you can use\n\n186\n00:12:13.373 --> 00:12:15.989\nto identify what tools\nare going to help you and\n\n187\n00:12:15.989 --> 00:12:18.150\nwhat tools aren't going to help you.\n\n188\n00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.080\nAnd if your tool is not on that list, or\n\n189\n00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.920\nthe one that you want to buy is not on\nthat list, then probably you're starting\n\n190\n00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.470\nfrom further back then you would be if\nyou were to buy a tool of that list.\n\n191\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.712\nNow before Cherokee asks me about money\ncuz she always asks me about money.\n\n192\n00:12:31.712 --> 00:12:34.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know\n\n193\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.220\nhow much a tool is going to cost you.\n\n194\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.510\nSome tools it's dependent on license and\n\n195\n00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.490\nit's dependent on the number\nof licenses that you buy,\n\n196\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:48.380\nsome tools you can just buy the tool and\nan unlimited number of licenses.\n\n197\n00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.190\nSome tools that depends on\nthe size of the organization.\n\n198\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.810\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n199\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.380\n&gt;&gt; One thing that I would say to\nyou is though we're aiming for\n\n200\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.940\nefficiency and effectiveness and\n\n201\n00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.195\ntherefore what that means is that he had\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to\n\n202\n00:13:00.195 --> 00:13:04.215\nover engineer your processes and therefore\nyou don't want to toll it's going to\n\n203\n00:13:04.215 --> 00:13:08.385\nover engineer your processes either,\nso keep it simple.\n\n204\n00:13:08.385 --> 00:13:13.845\n&gt;&gt; I mean even if you had the talent or\nthe skills set within your organization.\n\n205\n00:13:13.845 --> 00:13:18.285\nYou can even create internal databases or\nsoftware to be able to support that,\n\n206\n00:13:18.285 --> 00:13:22.320\nI mean I've worked with companies that\neven utilize third party companies to\n\n207\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.890\nbuild a custom solution for this type\nof situation with their databases.\n\n208\n00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.185\n&gt;&gt; You can, and we'll tell you that\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n209\n00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:35.004\nThere's a danger in that, though,\nthat as the ITIL framework itself updates,\n\n210\n00:13:35.004 --> 00:13:38.304\nas ISO 20000 updates.\n\n211\n00:13:38.304 --> 00:13:42.890\nThat any proprietary tool\nthat you have had created,\n\n212\n00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:47.160\nis going to support your\nadaptation of the ITL framework.\n\n213\n00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.719\nHowever, as that changes,\nthen the tool might not.\n\n214\n00:13:50.719 --> 00:13:53.436\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And there's always a danger with what\n\n215\n00:13:53.436 --> 00:13:58.051\nwe call bespoke software, with software\nthat's been created just for you,\n\n216\n00:13:58.051 --> 00:14:02.400\nis that it will meet the needs of your\norganization at that point in time.\n\n217\n00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.740\nBut the evolution might actually, well,\nmove out of bounds of best practice.\n\n218\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.249\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it might actually devolve\n\n219\n00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:10.252\nrather than evolve.\n\n220\n00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:13.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can see that,\nyes, I understand.\n\n221\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.660\n&gt;&gt; Because organizations, and\nthis is what tends to happen.\n\n222\n00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:22.040\nAnd I've worked with one tool manufacturer\nactually, a global tool manufacturer,\n\n223\n00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.747\nwho were looking to achieve and\nITIL audit passer PinkVERIFY.\n\n224\n00:14:26.747 --> 00:14:33.910\nAnd their tool had evolved as per the\nrequest of some of their major clients.\n\n225\n00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:39.587\nAnd their major clients had\nwanted some proprietary updates.\n\n226\n00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.155\nAnd so they put them into the tool set.\n\n227\n00:14:41.155 --> 00:14:45.685\nBut what had happened was with each\nedition with each, implementation,\n\n228\n00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:49.169\nshould we say, the tool had actually move-\n&gt;&gt; Steering away.\n\n229\n00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:53.604\n&gt;&gt; Further and further away from ITIL til\nthey get to a point where to bring it back\n\n230\n00:14:53.604 --> 00:14:57.370\nin line within ITIL framework or\nwith base practice.\n\n231\n00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.924\nIt took quite a lot of work\nto be able to achieve that.\n\n232\n00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:05.707\nAnd a lot of development work and a lot of\ntrying to get the balance between keeping\n\n233\n00:15:05.707 --> 00:15:09.944\nthe customers happy because the customers\nwanted to see this feature.\n\n234\n00:15:09.944 --> 00:15:11.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n235\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.950\nkeeping with the itil community\nhappy because best practice says no\n\n236\n00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.750\nreally this is the most\nefficient way of doing this.\n\n237\n00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.645\n&gt;&gt; Just like the struggle of a developer's\nlife like trying to keep everyone happy.\n\n238\n00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:23.467\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n239\n00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:26.370\nthat's exactly what\nthey had to go through.\n\n240\n00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:32.050\nAnd so yes you can do this by bringing\nin somebody to build a tool for\n\n241\n00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:36.010\nyou, but\nthere's a danger that your tool will then,\n\n242\n00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:40.170\nlet's just say, devolve,\nrather than evolve.\n\n243\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.625\nAlso, bringing in somebody to build\na tool for you can be quite expensive.\n\n244\n00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:45.519\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's expensive.\n\n245\n00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:48.899\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean,\nwe don't tell you that there's a right or\n\n246\n00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:53.616\nwrong way to do anything and\nsuddenly as far as ISO 20000 is concerned.\n\n247\n00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:56.288\nIf you've got a tool that's\ngoing to facilitate things for\n\n248\n00:15:56.288 --> 00:16:00.037\nyou then all we want to see is that it's\nfacilitating and then it's not hindering.\n\n249\n00:16:00.037 --> 00:16:02.616\nAnd we don't really care\nwhat the tool is at all.\n\n250\n00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:05.112\n&gt;&gt; All right We don't\ncare how you do this, but\n\n251\n00:16:05.112 --> 00:16:08.028\nyou've gotta think about\nreturn on investments.\n\n252\n00:16:08.028 --> 00:16:12.349\nAnd when we're demonstrating\ndelivery value to the organization,\n\n253\n00:16:12.349 --> 00:16:14.657\nif we are a small service provider and\n\n254\n00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:19.080\nwe've got 100 people in our\nservice provider organization.\n\n255\n00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.540\nAnd we've just spent $30 million on\nhaving utility challenges for us.\n\n256\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Then where's my profit?\n\n257\n00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.500\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'm struggling to see where we\nprovide value to the organization, okay?\n\n258\n00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.660\nIt might be difficult for\nus to demonstrate that, so\n\n259\n00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.592\nyou've gotta think about this.\n\n260\n00:16:34.592 --> 00:16:39.830\nThere's gotta be a reason sort\nof decision that you make,\n\n261\n00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.640\nso let's take a look, then,\nat other evidence that we want to see.\n\n262\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.700\nThe first thing that we want to see is,\nas an auditor,\n\n263\n00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.750\nyou will have to sit down with your\nclient and agree your audit scope.\n\n264\n00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:58.500\nSo what we need you to do is right at the\nbeginning, and this, again, is why we'd\n\n265\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:04.460\nsay use an external consultancy to help\nyou with this the first time you do this.\n\n266\n00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.830\nBecause your scope statement has got to be\nagreed with the auditor and out of bounds,\n\n267\n00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.790\nand it's got to be very specific.\n\n268\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:15.520\nNow this is the same slide that you saw\n\n269\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.120\nearlier on in our previous episodes,\nactually.\n\n270\n00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.090\nBut your scope statement has gotta\nbe specific to your organization.\n\n271\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:30.720\nAnd this is the scope that\nyou will audit against.\n\n272\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.810\nSo, that includes the scope of\nyour service management system.\n\n273\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.970\nSo what procedures and\nwhat policies are outside of scope?\n\n274\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.420\nAnd what procedures and policies and\nprocesses are inside of scope?\n\n275\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.290\nAnd that includes the interfaces.\n\n276\n00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.471\nAnd think about the interfaces\nwith third parties.\n\n277\n00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:54.030\nThat includes the services\nthat you are auditing for.\n\n278\n00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.880\nAnd it includes geographical\nlocation perhaps.\n\n279\n00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.425\nThere are optional,\nsuch as who your customer is, cuz maybe\n\n280\n00:18:02.425 --> 00:18:07.855\nyou only want to audit one specific\nservice for one specific customer.\n\n281\n00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:10.645\nBecause maybe you've got everything\nworking really great for\n\n282\n00:18:10.645 --> 00:18:14.006\nthat one specific service, so\nwe only wanna audit that one service.\n\n283\n00:18:16.217 --> 00:18:17.517\nWould I recommend her?\n\n284\n00:18:17.517 --> 00:18:21.768\nNo, I mean, it's a good starting point,\nbut I personally wouldn't recommend it.\n\n285\n00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:26.276\nBecause all it takes is one change on\nanother service that might undermine\n\n286\n00:18:26.276 --> 00:18:30.641\nthe integrity of the infrastructure\nthat might actually then cause you\n\n287\n00:18:30.641 --> 00:18:34.808\nto have nonconformities in audit\non that particular service.\n\n288\n00:18:34.808 --> 00:18:36.508\nSo, is it impossible?\n\n289\n00:18:36.508 --> 00:18:37.488\nNo, it's not impossible.\n\n290\n00:18:37.488 --> 00:18:42.338\nAnd I've seen organizations that\nwill very much limit their scope.\n\n291\n00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:45.318\nHowever, what you have to do is make sure\nthat you agree that with the auditor\n\n292\n00:18:45.318 --> 00:18:45.838\nin advance.\n\n293\n00:18:45.838 --> 00:18:48.380\nAnd if the auditor\ndoesn't like your scope,\n\n294\n00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.830\nhe's gonna tell you that\nhe doesn't like your scope.\n\n295\n00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:57.169\nSo again, I'd recommend that you get\nsome professional advice before you\n\n296\n00:18:57.169 --> 00:19:04.323\ndecide on the scope statement to make sure\nthat it lies within the audit guidelines.\n\n297\n00:19:04.323 --> 00:19:08.392\nNow Part 3 includes examples,\nand don't forget,\n\n298\n00:19:08.392 --> 00:19:15.160\nthere are Parts 1 through to Parts 11 of\nthe actual international standard itself.\n\n299\n00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.012\nAnd in fact, if we look at part 11,\n\n300\n00:19:18.012 --> 00:19:23.912\nthat refers to the interaction\nbetween ITIL and between ISO 20,000.\n\n301\n00:19:23.912 --> 00:19:27.300\nSo there are numerous parts\nthat are going to help you.\n\n302\n00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.030\nThey're gonna provide guidance,\nand of course,\n\n303\n00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.650\nwe know Part 2 provides guidance as well.\n\n304\n00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.793\nSo look at Part 3, it includes examples\nof technology that we can use,\n\n305\n00:19:35.793 --> 00:19:39.326\nsuch as the service and\nthe desktops and the networks, etc.\n\n306\n00:19:39.326 --> 00:19:44.440\nIt just provide just examples of\nthe technology that we will use.\n\n307\n00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.360\nAnd so, we will,\nin our scope, we will outline\n\n308\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.120\nexactly what technology it includes and\nwhat technology it doesn't include.\n\n309\n00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.666\nJust bear in mind that if there\nare interfaces into that technology, and\n\n310\n00:19:57.666 --> 00:20:02.343\nthat technology is running something\nthat you depend on for ISO 20,000,\n\n311\n00:20:02.343 --> 00:20:04.480\nthen you can't exclude it.\n\n312\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.660\nFor instance, think about our servers and\nour mainframes.\n\n313\n00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.640\nThe server where your\ncall login system sits,\n\n314\n00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.270\ndo you actually want to exclude that\nphysical piece of hardware or not?\n\n315\n00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.840\nBecause you're going to have an interface\ninto that piece of hardware, so\n\n316\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.070\nwhy exclude it?\n\n317\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.433\nIf your front end for some of the services\nthat you provide to your end users and\n\n318\n00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:30.247\nyour customers,\nif that front end is on a mobile device,\n\n319\n00:20:30.247 --> 00:20:33.994\nthen do you want to exclude\nthose mobile devices or not?\n\n320\n00:20:33.994 --> 00:20:38.141\nIt's something that you\nhave to consider when you\n\n321\n00:20:38.141 --> 00:20:42.540\nare defining the scope for\nthe order itself.\n\n322\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.740\nSo when you are preparing for your audit,\nthink about whether your audit is gonna be\n\n323\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.440\nperformed in conjunction with ISO 9,000,\nwhich is for quality management, or\n\n324\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.510\nISO 27,002, which, of course,\nis for IT security management.\n\n325\n00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:02.590\nAnd make sure that you understand\nexactly what is involved of you.\n\n326\n00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.650\nAnd then select your certification body.\n\n327\n00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.276\nInvolve that order to as early as you\npossibly can in the scope definition,\n\n328\n00:21:11.276 --> 00:21:13.150\nso that you can agree that within.\n\n329\n00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.944\nAnd then prepare all of your third party,\nsuch as your suppliers,\n\n330\n00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:20.010\nsuch as your staff,\nsuch as representatives, etc.\n\n331\n00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:27.770\nAnd this is why we have the ISO\n20,000 foundation certification.\n\n332\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.770\nIt's not just about preparing you for\naudit, but\n\n333\n00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:35.420\nit's also about preparing all of your\nstaff for the audit process as well.\n\n334\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.061\nThis is why we even offer an exam and\na certificate for\n\n335\n00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:44.820\nyour staff to say that yes,\nI know what's expected.\n\n336\n00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.110\nNow will that help your audit chances?\n\n337\n00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.200\nTechnically no,\nit won't help your audit chances.\n\n338\n00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.820\nBut certainly, when the evidence\nthat the auditor is looking for\n\n339\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.850\nstates that I'm gonna go and ask my stuff.\n\n340\n00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.720\nI'm gonna go and ask you stuff where\nthe information security policy is, for\n\n341\n00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.690\ninstance.\n\n342\n00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:10.346\nWell, if everybody's prepared for all the\nquestions that the auditors going to ask,\n\n343\n00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:11.782\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; I think naturally,\n\n344\n00:22:11.782 --> 00:22:15.080\nyou would just be additional support,\na support system there.\n\n345\n00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.713\nSo hey, I know what they're talking about,\nlet me help in any way I can.\n\n346\n00:22:17.713 --> 00:22:23.190\nI mean, because that should be the\nultimate goal for everyone involved here.\n\n347\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.573\n&gt;&gt; I have known organizations,\n\n348\n00:22:24.573 --> 00:22:28.514\nlarge multinational organizations that\nhave looked to achieve ISO 20,000.\n\n349\n00:22:28.514 --> 00:22:32.486\nAnd the first thing that they've\ndone is in preparation for\n\n350\n00:22:32.486 --> 00:22:37.580\nISO 20,000 is that, everybody has\nhad ITIL foundation training.\n\n351\n00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.280\nAbsolutely everybody, because we know\nthat that's a prerequisite for this.\n\n352\n00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.590\nAnyway, so everybody's had\nthe ITIL foundation training.\n\n353\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.840\nAnd then in preparation for\n\n354\n00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.600\nthe audit, everybody has had\nISO 20,000 training as well.\n\n355\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.980\nSo everyone within IT has had that,\nso they know what to expect.\n\n356\n00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.401\nThey already know all of the terminology,\netc,\n\n357\n00:22:57.401 --> 00:23:01.427\nthat's being used because they've\nundertaken the ITIL foundation training.\n\n358\n00:23:01.427 --> 00:23:05.970\nAnd so with the ISO 20,000 foundation\ntraining, then this is just\n\n359\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:11.410\na demonstrable proof to the auditor that\neverybody's fully equipped for this audit.\n\n360\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:17.295\nAnd I mean fully equipped mentally and\nthat everybody is prepared for this audit.\n\n361\n00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.875\nSo does it technically help?\n\n362\n00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:24.495\nTechnically no, but\nwill it realistically help you?\n\n363\n00:23:24.495 --> 00:23:27.505\nYes, it will because it means that\neverybody is going to be prepared.\n\n364\n00:23:27.505 --> 00:23:30.135\nThen of course now,\nwe've got the beauty of\n\n365\n00:23:30.135 --> 00:23:35.305\nbeing able to get all of this information\nto your staff through this medium.\n\n366\n00:23:35.305 --> 00:23:39.460\nAnd they can actually watch these shows,\nand that will help.\n\n367\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.240\nIt will give them an overview of what\nit is that you're trying to achieve.\n\n368\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.430\nPrepare your documentation pack for\nthe auditor.\n\n369\n00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:50.050\nAnd the first time that you do this, as\nI've said, try and get somebody external,\n\n370\n00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.890\nsomebody who knows the process\nto help you with this.\n\n371\n00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:57.236\nBecause I will guarantee,\nand I don't guarantee a lot,\n\n372\n00:23:57.236 --> 00:23:59.201\nespecially not within IT [LAUGH].\n\n373\n00:23:59.201 --> 00:24:03.069\nI don't guarantee a lot, but I'll\nguarantee that if you don't have somebody\n\n374\n00:24:03.069 --> 00:24:07.054\nwho's been through this before An external\nperson to help you with this the first\n\n375\n00:24:07.054 --> 00:24:10.040\ntime, you won't have\nsufficient information.\n\n376\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.580\nOkay.\n\n377\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.370\nAnd you've got to be prepared that\nsomething is going to be nonconformant.\n\n378\n00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:19.120\nAgain, which is why,\nthe first time you do it, get some help.\n\n379\n00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.670\nBecause, that way,\nnonconformities can be highlighted, and\n\n380\n00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.450\nyou can deal with them before your\nactual order, so get some help.\n\n381\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:28.810\nPart one of your order,\n\n382\n00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.910\nphase one of your order is going to\nhighlight any non conformities for you.\n\n383\n00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.290\nSo be prepared,\nyou have to do something about them.\n\n384\n00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.890\nIf you don't do anything about them,\n\n385\n00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:44.000\nthen you're going to in phase\ntwo fail your ISO 20,000.\n\n386\n00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.110\nLet's be prepared to do\nsomething about nonconformities.\n\n387\n00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.270\nNow we've already said ISO\n20000 is valid for three years.\n\n388\n00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.990\nBut you're gonna have top up\naudits as I'd like to call them or\n\n389\n00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.590\nsurveillance audit at least once a year.\n\n390\n00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:01.690\nAnd there may be if there's been\nany serious issues highlighted\n\n391\n00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.790\nIn your surveillance audits, then there\nare going to be follow up visits to\n\n392\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.710\nmake sure you are getting back-\n&gt;&gt; Complying?\n\n393\n00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:08.690\n&gt;&gt; Up to the standards.\n\n394\n00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.160\nRight, you have to.\n\n395\n00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.785\nAnd so you have to continue all\nof your internal audits etc,\n\n396\n00:25:14.785 --> 00:25:18.305\nexactly as what's specified in part one.\n\n397\n00:25:18.305 --> 00:25:19.305\nYou have to do this.\n\n398\n00:25:19.305 --> 00:25:21.795\nThis is a commitment.\n\n399\n00:25:21.795 --> 00:25:24.195\nThis is not just a one off exercise.\n\n400\n00:25:24.195 --> 00:25:29.895\nThis is a commitment to actually\ndoing this on an ongoing basis,\n\n401\n00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:31.425\nprobably indefinitely.\n\n402\n00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.790\nAnd you have to make sure that you're\ngonna be given your expiration date\n\n403\n00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.350\nwhich you know that is typically\nthree years or thereabout.\n\n404\n00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.220\nSo you're gonna be given your\nexpiration date for your certificate so\n\n405\n00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.320\nyou have to make sure in your surveillance\naudit that everything's kept up to date.\n\n406\n00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.600\nAnd then when it comes to your\nthree years, that you're ready for\n\n407\n00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.940\nyour re-audit at that point in time.\n\n408\n00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:00.000\nNow one of the things about the ISO 20,000\ncertificate is that once you've got your\n\n409\n00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.920\ncertificate, anybody can ask\nto see your certificate.\n\n410\n00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.100\nSo it mentions in that bottom bullet point\nin there about inspecting the certificate.\n\n411\n00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.348\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, I just can't make this up.\n\n412\n00:26:11.348 --> 00:26:12.378\n&gt;&gt; You can't.\n\n413\n00:26:12.378 --> 00:26:16.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's an official certificate as well\n\n414\n00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.080\nand it has the expiry date on there and\n\n415\n00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.130\nit has other locations\nwhich it is applicable to.\n\n416\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.160\nAnd the certificate's very, very specific,\n\n417\n00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.620\nso the certificate will state,\nthis is what it applies to.\n\n418\n00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.780\nSo an organization, and\nI've seen organizations that do this.\n\n419\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.090\nThey can display their certificate or\n\n420\n00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.800\ndisplay a flag on the wall\nof the organization.\n\n421\n00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.300\nAs you walk into their office and\n\n422\n00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.380\ninto their reception you'll\nsee that certificate.\n\n423\n00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.710\nBe careful about the words\nin those certificates,\n\n424\n00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:51.370\nbecause just because one particular\nservice provider within one particular\n\n425\n00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:56.000\nbusiness unit has achieve ISO 20,000,\nit doesn't mean that ISO 20,000\n\n426\n00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.920\ntherefore applies to the whole of\nthe organization and especially,\n\n427\n00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.720\nwhen you're talking about,\nyou know, software as a service.\n\n428\n00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.940\nOrganizations that provide\nthat sort of service.\n\n429\n00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.340\nThey're going to have a number of\ndifferent service provider units\n\n430\n00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.660\nproviding service to different customers.\n\n431\n00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:18.040\nAnd one of those service provider units,\none of those services to one customer may\n\n432\n00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.940\nhave achieved ISO 20000 certification,\nbecause maybe the customer requires it.\n\n433\n00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.140\nBut it doesn't necessarily\napply to any of the others.\n\n434\n00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.141\nSo be careful, you cannot fabricate this.\n\n435\n00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:35.500\n[LAUGH] You can't sort of,\nmaybe I don't know,\n\n436\n00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.320\nget sort of the tape-\n&gt;&gt; Photoshop it.\n\n437\n00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, you can't Photoshop it,\nyou can't get the tape out, the tippet,\n\n438\n00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.160\nthe white out or whatever.\n\n439\n00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.520\nAnd just write something else in.\n\n440\n00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.210\nYou can't do that,\nit is an official certificate and\n\n441\n00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.010\nit will have an expiry date and\nit will say the location and\n\n442\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:58.180\nthe somewhat of the scope on\nthat particular certificate.\n\n443\n00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.250\nAnd anybody can ask to see it.\n\n444\n00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.490\nSo be aware of that.\n\n445\n00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.590\nSo that's it in terms of preparation for\nyour audit, that's it for\n\n446\n00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.580\nthis particular episode.\n\n447\n00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.710\nAnd I'd like you to join us again.\n\n448\n00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.750\nWe do have another\ncouple of episodes left,\n\n449\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:16.200\nand one of the covers maintain it,\nyour certificate.\n\n450\n00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.750\nMake sure that you do stay up to date.\n\n451\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.320\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n452\n00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.970\nthen we're gonna be looking, you do have\nsome exercises that are available to\n\n453\n00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.270\nyou to ensure your understanding.\n\n454\n00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:29.550\nAnd of course there's a test\nassociated with this particular class.\n\n455\n00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:35.820\nYou can obtain your own ISO\n20,000 Foundation Certification.\n\n456\n00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.400\nAnd so yes, we do have a sample\npaper available to you that I'm\n\n457\n00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.330\ngoing to ask you to do, and then we're\ngoing to run through that sample paper.\n\n458\n00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:48.220\nBut for now then, we're just\ngonna sign off for this episode.\n\n459\n00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.190\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, thank you.\n\n460\n00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.460\nAnd you don't wanna miss the rest\nof this because we've come so far,\n\n461\n00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.860\nlet's go ahead and see this through.\n\n462\n00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:58.600\nLet's get that certification both for\nour organization and to pass that exam for\n\n463\n00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.580\nourselves, as well.\n\n464\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.940\n&gt;&gt; Why are you making\nthis sound like torture?\n\n465\n00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.020\nI just want to say this.\n\n466\n00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.570\nYou've come so\nfar you might as well continue.\n\n467\n00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:06.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, they have come this far.\n\n468\n00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:11.187\nYou guys have come so far so- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have this vision in my head of some\n\n469\n00:29:11.187 --> 00:29:17.010\npoor guy trekking across a deserted\nisland and he's been there for 500 years.\n\n470\n00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:19.510\nAnd he's just trying to get to that.\n\n471\n00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.180\n&gt;&gt; Hey I have been studying for\ncertifications and\n\n472\n00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.490\nfelt like I was trekking in a desert.\n\n473\n00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.600\nBut hopefully you haven't felt that way\nand we're almost there so I'm just saying.\n\n474\n00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.600\nHang in there.\nWe're gonna get that cert, and\n\n475\n00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.260\nwe're gonna get you through\nthis audit process.\n\n476\n00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.390\nSo we'll sign off for now,\nand see you next time.\n\n477\n00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.052\nHave a good one.\n\n478\n00:29:38.052 --> 00:29:44.151\nBye.\n[MUSIC]\n\n479\n00:29:44.151 --> 00:29:47.060\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

00:00:08.503\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:12.096\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:18.385\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your ISO/IEC\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.630\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.104\nIn this episode, we'll talk about\nachieving and maintaining that important\n\n8\n00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:27.221\nISO certification that we've been\ncovering throughout the series.\n\n9\n00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:30.350\nBack with us today in studios,\nwe have ISO expert Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.800\nHow's it going Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great,\nCherokee, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.290\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful,\nwe're rounding the end of our series here.\n\n13\n00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.550\nWe've covered quite a significant bit so\nfar.\n\n14\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.370\nSo what's left here on this show?\n\n15\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, what we're gonna look at\nnow is just really the simple sort\n\n16\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.230\nof getting into ISO 20000 and\nthen how do we maintain ISO 20000?\n\n17\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.980\nVery, very simply, and then in the\nsubsequent session we're going to just go\n\n18\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.380\nover our foundation test in itself,\nbecause we do have test\n\n19\n00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.070\nat the end of this and this is something\nthat you can encourage your staff to take.\n\n20\n00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.107\nAnd certainly it's something that I would\nbe encouraging you to take if you're\n\n21\n00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:16.369\nlooking to implemented ISO 20000,\nbecause it just tests that you have gained\n\n22\n00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.803\na general understanding of what it is that\nwe are looking for in ISO 20000 audit?\n\n23\n00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:23.030\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan.\n\n24\n00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.930\nSo yes of course,\n\n25\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.963\nonce we achieve that we definitely wanna\nhold onto it and maintain that status.\n\n26\n00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:31.782\nSo what are some things that\nwe should be thinking about\n\n27\n00:01:31.782 --> 00:01:36.240\nto solidify that procurement\nof the certification?\n\n28\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing that I wanna do\nis just go over something that we covered\n\n29\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.000\nright the way back in our\nfirst episode actually,\n\n30\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.420\nwhich was about our\nservice management system.\n\n31\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.960\nAnd we have here our Plan, Do,\n\n32\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.180\nCheck, ACT iterative and\nview of our service management system.\n\n33\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.070\nAll we have to do is we have to both\nestablish we have to improve our service\n\n34\n00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.710\nmanagement system, in an iterative\nway using Plan, Do, Check, Act.\n\n35\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.698\nAnd so when we define the scope for\nour audit itself,\n\n36\n00:02:06.698 --> 00:02:12.425\nwhen we've already covered in a previous\nsection how we define the scope.\n\n37\n00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:17.577\nAnd we do cover the scope,\nwhen we do have this scope defined, then\n\n38\n00:02:17.577 --> 00:02:23.850\nwe go to plan what our service management\nsystem should look like for that scope.\n\n39\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.916\nWe probably already got quite a lot\nin place already but nevertheless\n\n40\n00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:34.160\nthere are going to be a lot of times\nwhere we've got our scope defined and\n\n41\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.221\nnow we've got to say, okay well\nthis is what we're going to audit.\n\n42\n00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:42.870\nNow let's plan what our service management\nsystem looks like for this service.\n\n43\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.944\nIn a previous episode,\nI mentioned the fact that,\n\n44\n00:02:45.944 --> 00:02:48.946\nif you were a software is\na service type provider,\n\n45\n00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:53.752\nthen you may have different services\nthat you provide to different customers.\n\n46\n00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:58.264\nAnd you might want to just say\naudit one particular service for\n\n47\n00:02:58.264 --> 00:03:01.387\none customer, maybe they require it, and\n\n48\n00:03:01.387 --> 00:03:06.300\nyou might just wanna audit it\nthat one service for ISO 20000.\n\n49\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.320\nWell, I will in which case and\nyou're gonna have to define your scope.\n\n50\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.390\nAnd then you, after you've defined your\nscope, we're going to have to look at\n\n51\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.490\nthe service management system ie, you're\ngoing to have to look at the processes and\n\n52\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.980\nthe plans and the policies that you\nhave in place to manage that service.\n\n53\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.000\nSo, that's your plan, and\nyour plan is to cover\n\n54\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.890\nthat scope to ensure that you've got the\npolicies in place to manage that service,\n\n55\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.700\nso then you go in to put those policies\ninto action that's part of your do,\n\n56\n00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.190\nit's implementing and operating the SMS\nit's putting the policies into action.\n\n57\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.100\nThat also includes not just putting\nthe policies into action, but\n\n58\n00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.220\nputting the right people\nin the right places and\n\n59\n00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.260\ngiving these people\nthe right amount of skills.\n\n60\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.357\nTo be able to do their role, and\nhaving the right tools in place to be\n\n61\n00:03:59.357 --> 00:04:04.838\nable to fulfill the needs, and\nto be able to facilitate the processes.\n\n62\n00:04:04.838 --> 00:04:09.760\nAnd so once you implement it,\nthen you've gotta check that it's working.\n\n63\n00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.673\nAnd that includes an internal audit,\nthat includes management reviews perhaps.\n\n64\n00:04:14.673 --> 00:04:19.367\nAnd then in the Act part of the plan\ndue checkout, what I want to see is,\n\n65\n00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:23.511\nthat you're identifying opportunities for\nimprovement and\n\n66\n00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:26.794\nthat you are then managers\nknows improvements.\n\n67\n00:04:26.794 --> 00:04:30.798\nSo you plan them, yo do them,\nyou check that they've worked and\n\n68\n00:04:30.798 --> 00:04:34.374\nthen you make recommendations for\nfuture improvement.\n\n69\n00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:40.867\nWhen you first decide that you want to\nachieve ISO 20000, then you'll bring\n\n70\n00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:46.437\nsomebody in that will help you to\ndefine the scope and to plan your SMS.\n\n71\n00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:50.000\nBut at that point in time you're\ngoing to have to do the work.\n\n72\n00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.103\nYou're going to have to implement those\npolicies, you're going to have to\n\n73\n00:04:54.103 --> 00:04:58.734\nimplement the processes the procedures on\nimplementing the tools that can help you.\n\n74\n00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:03.630\nYou're going to have to implement the\ntraining that everybody will need in order\n\n75\n00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.000\nto be able to fulfill that role.\n\n76\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.810\nSo that can be quite a huge project and\nI have said this number of times.\n\n77\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.400\nI have said to you over the course\nof the last two episodes,\n\n78\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.360\nthat this is not something you're\ngoing to be able to do overnight\n\n79\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.080\nthis is something that\nyou make a decision.\n\n80\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.414\nAnd then after you've made that decision,\nit could be two or three years perhaps\n\n81\n00:05:27.414 --> 00:05:32.212\nbefore you actually feel in a position\nwhere you are ready to go to audit.\n\n82\n00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:36.752\nWe're gonna start off with wherever we\nare right now which is gonna be chaos.\n\n83\n00:05:36.752 --> 00:05:39.267\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I mean it might not necessarily be\n\n84\n00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:43.494\nchaos, but it's going to be\nthe proprietary way that you work.\n\n85\n00:05:43.494 --> 00:05:47.636\nAnd during Phase 2,\nPhase 2 will be where you start to, well,\n\n86\n00:05:47.636 --> 00:05:52.730\nyou make that decision where that dotted\nline is between Phase 1 and Phase 2.\n\n87\n00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.777\nYou make the decision that you\nwant to achieve ISO 20,000,\n\n88\n00:05:57.777 --> 00:06:02.377\nand so this is where you decide\nhow you're going to do this.\n\n89\n00:06:02.377 --> 00:06:04.495\nThis is where you do your planning.\n\n90\n00:06:04.495 --> 00:06:10.055\nAnd you might use something like framework\nlike ITIL to help you with this.\n\n91\n00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:11.975\nAnd here you're going to plan.\n\n92\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.226\nAnd here, you're going to implement.\n\n93\n00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:17.657\nAnd we're going to have to implement.\n\n94\n00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:22.308\nAnd, of course, all the time, over time,\nwe are improving not only our\n\n95\n00:06:22.308 --> 00:06:27.267\nalignment to the organization, but\nwe're improving towards our goal, and\n\n96\n00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:30.797\nour goal is to achieve\nISO 20000 certification.\n\n97\n00:06:30.797 --> 00:06:35.882\nSo, all of the time we might want to hear,\nwe might want to implement,\n\n98\n00:06:35.882 --> 00:06:40.453\nsay an ITIL based framework, and\nthen we ensure that ITIL based\n\n99\n00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:45.543\nframework here will meet the needs\nof the service management system,\n\n100\n00:06:45.543 --> 00:06:50.741\nand will actually conform to the scope\nthat we have initially defined.\n\n101\n00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:54.220\nYou might think of your scope as being\nyour vision, for instance, if you\n\n102\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.060\nare looking at continual improvement\nyou'd be looking at having a direction.\n\n103\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.233\nYour scope is your direction,\n\n104\n00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:04.423\nyour scope is your vision that's\nwhat you want to achieve.\n\n105\n00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:08.930\nI've got an example here of a plan\nwithin a specific organization.\n\n106\n00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.002\nAnd if we look at different\nphases here within this plan,\n\n107\n00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:16.421\nyou see that we've got Phase 1, which is\nthe management system in the planning.\n\n108\n00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:19.313\nAnd that's one that I know that\nI've said this to you before and\n\n109\n00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:21.235\nthis is not something that you have to do.\n\n110\n00:07:21.235 --> 00:07:24.670\nBut what I've said to you before is\nthe fact that you might bring somebody\n\n111\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.356\nexternal in.\n\n112\n00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:29.689\nYou do self-assessment audits to see\nhow compliant you are, but I would be,\n\n113\n00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:31.700\nif you've never done this before.\n\n114\n00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.080\nThen I would certainly,\n\n115\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.162\nI'd be bringing somebody in externally\nto help you at this point in time.\n\n116\n00:07:37.162 --> 00:07:39.210\nAnd then you make the decisions here.\n\n117\n00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.485\nYou'll make the decisions right here as\nto not only what your scope is because\n\n118\n00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:48.155\nagain that scope's gonna have to be agreed\nhere in your final certification audit,\n\n119\n00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:51.533\nyour scope's gonna have to be\nagreed with your auditor's.\n\n120\n00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:57.225\nSo, at this point in time, get somebody\nin to help you and define your vision,\n\n121\n00:07:57.225 --> 00:08:02.145\ndefine your scope and then throughout\nPhase 1 through to Phase 2,\n\n122\n00:08:02.145 --> 00:08:05.380\nwe've got process implementation.\n\n123\n00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.974\nSo here we've planned, here we've got\nour vision, and we've planned and\n\n124\n00:08:08.974 --> 00:08:11.013\nhere we're implementing our processes.\n\n125\n00:08:11.013 --> 00:08:14.900\nAnd they may be faced on\na framework such as ITIL.\n\n126\n00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.275\nAnd here then, we want to then,\nonce we've got that implemented, and\n\n127\n00:08:18.275 --> 00:08:22.294\nwe've got our service management system\nimplemented, and it seems to be working.\n\n128\n00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:26.724\nWe wanna make sure that they're subject\nto continual improvement by doing\n\n129\n00:08:26.724 --> 00:08:28.350\nan internal audit.\n\n130\n00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.310\nDoes it actually meet\nthe needs of the organization?\n\n131\n00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.914\nDoes it meet the requirements\nof the certification,\n\n132\n00:08:36.914 --> 00:08:41.720\nand are there any nonconformities here?\n\n133\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.840\nThese nonconformity the areas where\nwe don't meet the requirements,\n\n134\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.300\nwe don't meet the scope necessarily,\n\n135\n00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.500\nwell these nonconformities\nare where we have to improve.\n\n136\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.220\nAnd then we prepare for\n\n137\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.040\na certification in Phase 1 and\nthat's by doing our pre-assessment audit.\n\n138\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.970\nSo our Phase 1 audit and\n\n139\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.220\nour second phase audit as well Which\nis the final certification ordered.\n\n140\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.700\nNow at this point in time, if you've\ngot somebody external, if you've got\n\n141\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.160\nan external consultant in, then at this\npoint in time you're pre-assessment order.\n\n142\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.057\nYou'll already be aware of what\nnon-conformities you have.\n\n143\n00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:22.064\nSo I'd expect that once we get to this\npoint here, you should be aware of where\n\n144\n00:09:22.064 --> 00:09:26.194\nyou need to improve, and if in fact it's\nreally down to here, during Phase 3,\n\n145\n00:09:26.194 --> 00:09:28.830\nwhere all of this should come out.\n\n146\n00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.746\nIf you don't have anybody\nexternal helping you with this,\n\n147\n00:09:32.746 --> 00:09:37.619\nthen your internal audit at Phase 3,\nthey might not pick everything up.\n\n148\n00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.027\nAnd just be aware of that,\n\n149\n00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:43.396\nyour pre-assessment audit may pick up\nother things that you haven't noticed.\n\n150\n00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:47.469\nAnd then we're moving to the end of\nPhase 4 where you get your final\n\n151\n00:09:47.469 --> 00:09:48.939\ncertification audit.\n\n152\n00:09:48.939 --> 00:09:51.960\nAnd that's where your\ncertificate will be awarded.\n\n153\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.889\nAnd then at that point in time,\nfrom there onwards what will happen is,\n\n154\n00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:58.835\nyou will have your surveillance\naudits every year and\n\n155\n00:09:58.835 --> 00:10:01.797\nthen you will have your full\naudit every three years.\n\n156\n00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:08.483\nI've already mentioned in\na previous episode that tool set,\n\n157\n00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:11.761\nthey don't conform to ISO 20,000.\n\n158\n00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:16.959\nThey don't conform to ITIL either,\nalthough if we look at\n\n159\n00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:22.474\nthe pink verify website,\nthen you will find a list of tools and\n\n160\n00:10:22.474 --> 00:10:27.591\nwhether they support the ITIL\nbest practice framework.\n\n161\n00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:32.380\nAnd also what process is within the ITIL\nbest practice framework they support.\n\n162\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.070\nYou have to make the decision as to\nhow you want to select your tool, and\n\n163\n00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.070\nwe've already had this discussion\nin our previous sessions.\n\n164\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.735\nSo you know that in our previous episode\nwe've spoken about this at length.\n\n165\n00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:47.508\nYou just need to make a decision,\n\n166\n00:10:47.508 --> 00:10:52.964\nas to whether you want to bring in\nsomebody to write it all for you.\n\n167\n00:10:52.964 --> 00:10:55.048\nWhether you want to buy\nsomething off the shelf and\n\n168\n00:10:55.048 --> 00:10:56.830\nhow you want to implement it as well.\n\n169\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.091\nDo you implement it module by module or\ndo want to try and\n\n170\n00:11:01.091 --> 00:11:04.623\nimplement everything\nin a big bang fashion?\n\n171\n00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:09.821\nDepends on the size of the organization\nand quite frankly it depends on the amount\n\n172\n00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:15.040\nof disruption that you are able to\naccommodate within the organization.\n\n173\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.300\nIt can be a challenge doing it either way\nbecause implementing in a phased manner,\n\n174\n00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.610\nwell that means that you're gonna\nhave some data on old data bases and\n\n175\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.905\nsome data on new data bases and\nyou have to think about migration, etc.\n\n176\n00:11:26.905 --> 00:11:32.025\nDoing it in a big bang fashion and bring\neverything in all once can be very costly,\n\n177\n00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:36.259\nbecause you're talking about all\nof the licenses, all upfront.\n\n178\n00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:40.614\nBut you also have to accommodate some\ndisruption where everybody tries to get\n\n179\n00:11:40.614 --> 00:11:45.103\nused to and you call login system where\neverybody is going to a training and where\n\n180\n00:11:45.103 --> 00:11:49.726\neverybody is kind of running around a bit\nlike headless chickens, to be perfectly\n\n181\n00:11:49.726 --> 00:11:53.820\nhonest at the beginning, wondering\nwhat on earth they should be doing.\n\n182\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.414\nWhatever you do, your implementation\nplan and your deployment plan and\n\n183\n00:11:59.414 --> 00:12:01.104\nthe processes themselves.\n\n184\n00:12:01.104 --> 00:12:05.878\nRemember you configure the tool\nto facilitate the processes,\n\n185\n00:12:05.878 --> 00:12:09.580\nthey should be in your\nservice management plan.\n\n186\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.542\nThey should be in your service management\nsystem because you're going to be audited\n\n187\n00:12:13.542 --> 00:12:15.155\nagainst those processes.\n\n188\n00:12:15.155 --> 00:12:18.505\nYou need that documentation so\nwhy rewrite it?\n\n189\n00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:19.887\nWhy reinvent the wheel?\n\n190\n00:12:19.887 --> 00:12:22.101\nThat's certainly not efficient.\n\n191\n00:12:22.101 --> 00:12:27.219\nIf you're implementing a new tool to help\nyou, then simply write your processes\n\n192\n00:12:27.219 --> 00:12:32.760\ndown that you want to achieve and\nthere you go, version one of your process.\n\n193\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.494\nYou've got something to show\nthe auditor when the auditor says,\n\n194\n00:12:37.494 --> 00:12:41.463\nshow me well, there you go,\nyou can show them, okay?\n\n195\n00:12:41.463 --> 00:12:46.000\nRemember, however you implement a tool,\nand\n\n196\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.447\nhowever you achieve your ISO 20000,\nyou have surveillance audits and\n\n197\n00:12:53.447 --> 00:12:57.653\nyou have another audit every three years.\n\n198\n00:12:57.653 --> 00:13:02.655\nThe auditor knows that in three years\nthings haven't remained the same,\n\n199\n00:13:02.655 --> 00:13:07.507\nbecause we're in IT, and things\ndon't stay the same for three years.\n\n200\n00:13:07.507 --> 00:13:11.828\nSo the auditor is to going to want to\nsee evidence that things have moved, and\n\n201\n00:13:11.828 --> 00:13:15.515\nthings have improved and\nthings have changed over three years.\n\n202\n00:13:15.515 --> 00:13:18.647\nCuz you cannot tell me and\nI don't believe you if you do,\n\n203\n00:13:18.647 --> 00:13:22.981\nyou can't tell me that three years have\nelapsed from one audit to the next when\n\n204\n00:13:22.981 --> 00:13:25.267\nyou've not raised any change request.\n\n205\n00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:28.051\nAnd you've not had any incidence,\nand you've not had any problems and\n\n206\n00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:30.291\neverything is exactly the same\nas it was three years ago.\n\n207\n00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:33.746\n&gt;&gt; You've got bigger problems than wanting\nto pass an audit if that were the case.\n\n208\n00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.496\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:35.996\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:13:35.996 --> 00:13:37.179\n&gt;&gt; Yes a lot bigger problems,\n\n211\n00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:38.983\nlike the fact that you have no customers.\n\n212\n00:13:38.983 --> 00:13:40.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n213\n00:13:40.395 --> 00:13:42.179\n&gt;&gt; That's a bigger problem.\n\n214\n00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:44.296\nSo, things will have changed over\n\n215\n00:13:44.296 --> 00:13:49.041\nthe three years and don't try and\nconvince the auditors that they haven't,\n\n216\n00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:51.110\nall right.\nWe can see through that.\n\n217\n00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:56.100\nSo, we need to see evidence that you\nhave improved over those three years,\n\n218\n00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.210\nwe need to see the evidence that\nyou have made improvements.\n\n219\n00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.990\nAnd that as things have changed,\nas maybe new services have come\n\n220\n00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.120\nonline as the number of incidents is\nincreased or decreased the number\n\n221\n00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.108\nof changes is increased or decreased, then\nwe want to see evidence of improvement.\n\n222\n00:14:12.108 --> 00:14:15.196\nAnd we want to see a plan for\nevery single improvement.\n\n223\n00:14:15.196 --> 00:14:17.539\nSo, we want to see things\nlike CSI registers,\n\n224\n00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:21.670\nwe want to see that you're prioritizing\nyour improvement opportunities.\n\n225\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.923\nAnd that when you're implementing\nimprovement opportunities\n\n226\n00:14:25.923 --> 00:14:29.789\nthat there's a plan behind that\nwe need to see all of that.\n\n227\n00:14:29.789 --> 00:14:34.850\nOkay, so now we have reached the end\nof our ISO 20000 course material,\n\n228\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.749\nand so what's available for\n\n229\n00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:41.530\nyou in your downloadable material\nare some refresher exercises.\n\n230\n00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:47.298\nJust to refresh your memories on exactly\nwhat we've covered throughout the class.\n\n231\n00:14:47.298 --> 00:14:51.677\nYou also have some sample\nquestions in a separate piece\n\n232\n00:14:51.677 --> 00:14:55.910\nof downloadable material or\na separate format.\n\n233\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:01.010\nSo what I'd like you to do right now is,\nI would like you to download the sample\n\n234\n00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:06.220\nquestions, and I would like you\nto take those sample questions.\n\n235\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.688\nAnd if you come back in a later session\nwe will go over the sample questions with\n\n236\n00:15:10.688 --> 00:15:13.740\nyou, there're only ten\nsample questions for you.\n\n237\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.255\nAnd so come back,\njoin us in a later session and\n\n238\n00:15:16.255 --> 00:15:19.932\nwe will actually go over those\nsample questions, and we'll go over\n\n239\n00:15:19.932 --> 00:15:24.740\na little bit more information about the\nactual exam for an ISO 20000 foundation.\n\n240\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, well you heard it.\n\n241\n00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.260\nYou don't wanna miss\nthose sample questions,\n\n242\n00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.850\nbecause that might give\nyou an insight into what,\n\n243\n00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.100\nas to what

Welcome back to your ISO/IEC\n20000:2011 Foundation series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.860\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.980\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be taking a look at an exam review.\n\n7\n00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.599\nAnd you guessed it, Mrs.\n\n8\n00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.500\nJo Peacock has some surprise,\nlike a pop quiz for us here.\n\n9\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.110\nSo we can only imagine how this is\ngoing to go, I'm pretty excited.\n\n10\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.921\nAnd you should be too because you'll\nprobably be laughing at my detriment\n\n11\n00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:36.604\nhere [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:38.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.148\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying a word, nothing.\n\n14\n00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:45.249\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we do have some questions\navailable that we are gonna cover here and\n\n15\n00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.060\njust kinda get in that mindset and\nthat mentality.\n\n16\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.190\nHey, I'm getting ready for this exam.\n\n17\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.970\nWhat should I expect, right?\n\n18\n00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, first of all, I mean,\nshe's being really eager right now.\n\n19\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.705\nShe's very enthusiastic,\nI'm not too sure, I don't know.\n\n20\n00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:00.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something wrong, I think.\n\n21\n00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.460\nBut let me tell you a little\nbit about your exam then.\n\n22\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.190\nFor those of you that have sat your ITIL\nFoundation exam, then you will find your\n\n23\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.480\nISO 20000 exam to be in a very,\nvery similar format.\n\n24\n00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.618\nYou will have a one hour to complete\n\n25\n00:01:18.618 --> 00:01:23.346\na 40 question multiple choice test.\n\n26\n00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:28.810\nYou'll need to get 26 out of 40 in\norder to pass, and you will take\n\n27\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.190\nyour exam in exactly the same way that\nyou would take your ITIL Foundation exam.\n\n28\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.862\nSo in this instance then,\nwhat you will do is,\n\n29\n00:01:38.862 --> 00:01:44.901\nyou will obtain your exam voucher and\nthen log on to the peoplecert website.\n\n30\n00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:50.327\nAnd the peoplecert organization,\nwell, they're an examining body and\n\n31\n00:01:50.327 --> 00:01:55.228\nthey will allow you to register for\nyour ISO 20000 Foundation\n\n32\n00:01:55.228 --> 00:02:00.570\nexam through their website at a time and\na date to suit yourself.\n\n33\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.550\nAnd then you will be given the exam at\nthat appropriate time in exactly the same\n\n34\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.490\nway as you would with your\nITIL Foundation test.\n\n35\n00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.617\nSo as I've said, you get 40 questions,\nand you get an hour to complete this.\n\n36\n00:02:12.617 --> 00:02:16.050\nYou've gotta get 26 out\nof 40 in order to pass.\n\n37\n00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.660\nNow with every single question,\nthere is only one right answer.\n\n38\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.260\nAt the moment, on the peoplecert website,\nthere is a sample paper, and\n\n39\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.490\nthat sample paper is 10 questions in\nlength, just to give you an idea for\n\n40\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.130\nwhat is expected in your\nISO 20000 Foundation test.\n\n41\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.902\nNow obviously,\nthis test is designed to test that you\n\n42\n00:02:42.902 --> 00:02:48.110\nunderstand what is required\nin the ISO 20000 audit.\n\n43\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.241\nNow I know that there's only 10 questions\non there, and we're going to go through\n\n44\n00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:55.070\nthese 10 questions now, so\nthat is your sample paper.\n\n45\n00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.950\nHowever, you do have the option for\ndownloadable\n\n46\n00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.420\nquestions as part of your downloadable\nmaterial to do with this particular class.\n\n47\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.310\nSo, there are additional questions there,\nand we'll make those available to you.\n\n48\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.024\nBut for now, for the actual official\nsample paper from peoplecert,\n\n49\n00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:16.750\nyou have 10 questions.\n\n50\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.611\nAnd so yep, we're gonna go over these now.\n\n51\n00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:21.702\nAnd in fact,\nthis is gonna be a pop quiz, and\n\n52\n00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:26.734\nI'm putting Cherokee on the spot,\neven more than I would normally do.\n\n53\n00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:27.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's gonna go great,\nlike I told you.\n\n54\n00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:30.918\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm feeling kind\nof vindictive today.\n\n55\n00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:34.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's thundering outside,\n\n56\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.220\nwe've got a bit of rain, and I'm in one\nof those vindictive moods, so watch out.\n\n57\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.336\nSomebody did say to me yesterday actually\nthat they were incredibly scared of me.\n\n58\n00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:46.569\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It wasn't me either.\n\n59\n00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It should have been her.\n\n60\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.070\n[LAUGH] All right, let's take a look\nat question number 1 then, should we?\n\n61\n00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.572\nOkay, then, what do you reckon then,\nquestion number 1, Cherokee?\n\n62\n00:03:57.572 --> 00:04:04.470\nISO 20000-1, so that's part 1,\ncan be applicable to a service provider,\n\n63\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.920\neven if the customers or\nsupplies have demonstrated conformity.\n\n64\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.870\nOr only if the suppliers have\ndemonstrated conformity.\n\n65\n00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.633\nOr only if the suppliers haven't\ndemonstrated conformity to ISO 20000.\n\n66\n00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.522\nOr only if its customers have\ndemonstrated conformity.\n\n67\n00:04:22.508 --> 00:04:26.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n[LAUGH] it's not about the customers.\n\n68\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.760\nBut that sounds horrible, but in this\nsituation, we're really talking, and\n\n69\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.920\nit's not really falling\nonto the suppliers.\n\n70\n00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.676\nIt's not their responsibility to have or\nhave not.\n\n71\n00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:39.730\nSo I'm gonna go with A for this one, Jo.\n\n72\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.308\n&gt;&gt; It is actually A.\n\n73\n00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:44.890\nIt doesn't matter about the customer or\nthe supplier in this instance.\n\n74\n00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.840\nIt's actually about you.\n\n75\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.233\nYou're the one that's being audited,\nnot your customers and not your suppliers,\n\n76\n00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:50.967\nit's about you.\n\n77\n00:04:50.967 --> 00:04:54.930\nSo it doesn't matter what they've done, so\nwhether they have demonstrated or whether\n\n78\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.529\nthey haven't demonstrated conformity\nto ISO 20000, the onus is on you.\n\n79\n00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:01.000\nYou're the one that's trying\nto achieve ISO 20000.\n\n80\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.930\nNow, you might not like\nthe wording on this, tough.\n\n81\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.540\n[LAUGH] That's what\nI've got to say to you.\n\n82\n00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.268\nThis is very typical of\nthe wording in your test.\n\n83\n00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:15.150\nSo I'm gonna tell you as I\ndo with every single test,\n\n84\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.810\nRTFQ, read the full question.\n\n85\n00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.090\nBe very, very clear on this.\n\n86\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.640\nRead the full question.\n\n87\n00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.610\nYou have got an hour to do this test,\nand you have got, well, it's an hour,\n\n88\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.970\n60 minutes, and you've got 40 questions.\n\n89\n00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.670\nThat's a minute and a half per question.\n\n90\n00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.010\nTake your time, and\nread every single word.\n\n91\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.516\nAnd in this case, it's, well, A.\n\n92\n00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:43.020\nSo what about number 2 then?\n\n93\n00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.160\nIn the Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology,\nsometimes known as the demon cycle,\n\n94\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.960\nit can be applied to all processes.\n\n95\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.827\nWhat about act?\n\n96\n00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:51.890\nWhat does act do?\n\n97\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.140\n&gt;&gt; Act is where we're\nactually doing something.\n\n98\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.980\nSo let's see what our\noptions that we've got.\n\n99\n00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.830\nImplement a process, take an action\nto improve process performance,\n\n100\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.240\nestablish objectives and\nprocesses to deliver results.\n\n101\n00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.740\nOkay, so\nlet me think about this one here then.\n\n102\n00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.177\nImplementing, so\nthat's a form of acting, right?\n\n103\n00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:19.431\nLet's see, but taking an action to improve\nprocess performance, hm, I would say,\n\n104\n00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:23.198\nthere's always like [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; There's only ever one answer.\n\n105\n00:06:23.198 --> 00:06:25.973\n&gt;&gt; There's only one answer, right,\nokay, so implementing a process, so\n\n106\n00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:28.275\nyou might have already a process\nthat's been implemented.\n\n107\n00:06:28.275 --> 00:06:30.087\nAnd you might just like improving it, so\n\n108\n00:06:30.087 --> 00:06:32.393\ntaking an action to improve\nprocess performance.\n\n109\n00:06:32.393 --> 00:06:33.674\nFinal answer, Alex.\n\n110\n00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:38.140\n&gt;&gt; What's Alex got to do with it?\n\n111\n00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.170\n&gt;&gt; You've never seen Jeopardy?\n\n112\n00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.827\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n113\n00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:44.275\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, I don't know.\n\n114\n00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:46.471\n&gt;&gt; What was your final answer, A?\n\n115\n00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:47.448\n&gt;&gt; B.\n\n116\n00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:51.740\n&gt;&gt; It was B, okay, yes,\nB is the right answer, it is B.\n\n117\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.600\nThink about Plan-Do-Check-Act, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.920\nPlan is you plan the implementation, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.580\nThen you do it, that's performing\nthe implementation, so that would be A.\n\n120\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.894\nThen you check that it's worked and then\nin act, well, you identify where things\n\n121\n00:07:06.894 --> 00:07:11.996\nhaven't quite worked and identify\nfurther opportunities for improvement.\n\n122\n00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:16.320\nSo taking action to improve process\nperformance, that's your act.\n\n123\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.543\nAnd of course, this is an iterative cycle,\nso yes, the answer is B.\n\n124\n00:07:20.543 --> 00:07:23.194\nYeah, that's one where you gotta\nlike read through each one of them.\n\n125\n00:07:23.194 --> 00:07:24.998\nBecause you're just like going through,\nand you're like A, and\n\n126\n00:07:24.998 --> 00:07:26.620\nthen you're like,\nthat sounds good enough, but no.\n\n127\n00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.169\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not, yeah.\n\n128\n00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:28.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n129\n00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:32.431\n&gt;&gt; Think about, you have to understand\nwhat happens in every single step in that\n\n130\n00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:34.271\ndemo cycle, Plan-Do-Check-Act.\n\n131\n00:07:34.271 --> 00:07:38.825\nOkay, what about then, 3,\nfor a service provider,\n\n132\n00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:42.890\nthe first step in developing\na security policy.\n\n133\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.410\nNow you should know this,\nyou should be good at this.\n\n134\n00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.836\nWhat's the answer for this one?\n\n135\n00:07:46.836 --> 00:07:48.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nlet's take a look at the options here.\n\n136\n00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:50.201\n&gt;&gt; Nothing like putting her on\nthe spot on this one at all.\n\n137\n00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:54.716\n&gt;&gt; Classifying information assets,\nsetting an owner of its\n\n138\n00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:59.149\ninformation asset, or\noverviewing past experiences?\n\n139\n00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:03.055\nOkay, that's a good one there.\n\n140\n00:08:03.055 --> 00:08:06.210\nOr D, aware staff, aware staff.\n\n141\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.730\nOkay, so trained staff?\n\n142\n00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, make staff aware.\n\n143\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.348\nYeah, the wording's not great.\n\n144\n00:08:10.348 --> 00:08:11.508\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely an important one.\n\n145\n00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:15.196\nOkay, all right.\n\n146\n00:08:15.196 --> 00:08:20.133\nSo we might want to have a good\nunderstanding about what kind of assets we\n\n147\n00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:25.410\nhave before we can triage them and\nperform any kind of risk analysis.\n\n148\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.590\nBut I don't know, Jo, it's tough,\nbecause also staff that's a big one.\n\n149\n00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.156\nYou always have to make sure\nyour staff are trained.\n\n150\n00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:33.015\n&gt;&gt;

Well, you know what, we're not waiting.\n\n157\n00:08:42.835 --> 00:08:46.505\nYou've got an hour,\nyou've got an hour to do 40 questions.\n\n158\n00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:49.355\nYou're not gonna do 40\nquestions at this rate.\n\n159\n00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:50.965\nYou got a minute and a half per question.\n\n160\n00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:53.265\n&gt;&gt; All right, a minute and a half,\nI think I've exceeded that.\n\n161\n00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:54.365\nSo we're gonna go with A, Jo.\n\n162\n00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:55.775\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna go with A?\n\n163\n00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:57.320\nIt is actually A, yes.\n\n164\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's defining the scope first.\n\n165\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.651\nYou've never seen\nthe British TV show Countdown?\n\n166\n00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:02.342\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n167\n00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:04.559\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\nin Countdown they have a clock.\n\n168\n00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:07.732\nThey give everybody\na particular conundrum to do,\n\n169\n00:09:07.732 --> 00:09:10.810\nand then they'll give everybody a clock.\n\n170\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:11.970\nAnd that's what what we need.\n\n171\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.852\nThat's what we need with you,\nwe need a little clock that ticks down.\n\n172\n00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:15.850\n&gt;&gt; With like a big loud buzzer sound here?\n\n173\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.417\n&gt;&gt; No it's not a buzzer sound, no.\n\n174\n00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:18.880\nIt's a very particular sound, and\n\n175\n00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.116\neverybody that's watching us in the UK\nknows exactly what I am talking about.\n\n176\n00:09:22.116 --> 00:09:25.349\nAnd we'll have to see if we can now Google\nthis one so that we could edit this in and\n\n177\n00:09:25.349 --> 00:09:26.102\nput it at the end.\n\n178\n00:09:26.102 --> 00:09:28.363\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Put it at the end now.\n\n179\n00:09:28.363 --> 00:09:30.830\nOkay, it is actually A.\n\n180\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.710\nFor service provider, the first thing\nthat we've got to do is define our scope.\n\n181\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.330\nSo work out exactly what our\nsets are going to be covered by\n\n182\n00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.540\nour security policy.\n\n183\n00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:45.740\nAnd then as part of the security policy,\nwell, as you say, we're doing risk\n\n184\n00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.800\nmanagement, but, yes, we've gotta set\nan owner for every information asset.\n\n185\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.440\nBut it's not just about information,\nof course.\n\n186\n00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.200\nThe IT security policy is\nabout absolutely everything.\n\n187\n00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.960\nAnd information security policy is\nsecurity of the information that we have,\n\n188\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.512\nand every single piece of information\nhas got to have an owner.\n\n189\n00:10:05.512 --> 00:10:09.470\nWe've gotta look at past experiences\nto help us define a policy,\n\n190\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.790\nto help us identify what might happen.\n\n191\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.290\nAnd sure, we've gotta train people, but\n\n192\n00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.830\nfirst of all we've gotta\nknow what we've got.\n\n193\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:16.830\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n194\n00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.150\n&gt;&gt; So what about number four, then?\n\n195\n00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.730\nWhat should be avoided in\nan access control policy?\n\n196\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I might like this one.\n\n197\n00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.150\nWhat kind of answers do we have here?\n\n198\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.850\nEverything is generally permitted unless,\nwhat does that say?\n\n199\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.080\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, RTFQ.\n\n210\n00:11:05.896 --> 00:11:06.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n211\n00:11:08.996 --> 00:11:09.833\nA.\n\n212\n00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:11.016\n&gt;&gt; A?\n\n213\n00:11:11.016 --> 00:11:11.981\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Service reporting, budget and\n\n271\n00:13:28.204 --> 00:13:30.740\naccounting, supplier management.\n\n272\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.360\nOkay, delivering.\n\n273\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.032\nDefinitely it's the supplier management.\n\n274\n00:13:37.032 --> 00:13:40.701\nBecause I have to have my supplies\nin order to be able to deliver.\n\n275\n00:13:40.701 --> 00:13:42.733\nThat's three.\n\n276\n00:13:42.733 --> 00:13:44.892\nOkay, budgeting and accounting.\n\n277\n00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:49.970\nYeah, I have to,\nI'm going to go two and three.\n\n278\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.120\nIs there not a two and three option?\n\n279\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.120\nNo, that's not even up there.\n\n280\n00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.055\nSo obviously, that's not the right answer.\n\n281\n00:13:54.055 --> 00:13:56.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man, all right.\n\n282\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.930\nC, because if you don't know the answer,\nyou always go with C, right?\n\n283\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.550\n&gt;&gt; Wrong [LAUGH].\n\n284\n00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.320\n&gt;&gt; So what is it, Jo?\n\n285\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.295\n&gt;&gt; It's one and two.\n\n286\n00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:10.190\nService delivery processes,\nthink of these as being a development and\n\n287\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.070\na design processes.\n\n288\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.020\nSo we'll process we have in there?\n\n289\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.060\nWell, we had budgeting and\naccounting, we didn't have charging.\n\n290\n00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.580\nWe also had service reporting.\n\n291\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.190\nWe had service level\nmanagement in there as well.\n\n292\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.345\nWe certainly didn't have\nsupplier management.\n\n293\n00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:27.860\nSupplier management is one of\nour relationship processes.\n\n294\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n295\n00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the answer there is D,\nthat's one and two.\n\n296\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.820\nOkay, so speaking of relationship\nprocesses, here's another one.\n\n297\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:37.570\nWhat about number seven?\n\n298\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.670\nWhat does BRM,\nBusiness Relationship Management, involve?\n\n299\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:46.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so documenting and\ninterfacing with relevant parties, yes.\n\n300\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.229\nManaging contracts and performance.\n\n301\n00:14:51.551 --> 00:14:54.395\nRoles and relationships with suppliers.\n\n302\n00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:56.671\nCommunication with the suppliers.\n\n303\n00:15:01.524 --> 00:15:08.670\nIt's not just the suppliers, so\nI have to be a little more vague.\n\n304\n00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.430\nI'm not gonna define it\nwith just the suppliers.\n\n305\n00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.070\nI'm gonna say relevant parties,\n\n306\n00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.670\nbecause you're going to be interfacing\nwith suppliers as well as customers.\n\n307\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.280\nBRN is also responsible for\nthose relationships.\n\n308\n00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.930\nWould A be right, Jo?\n\n309\n00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, A is right.\n\n310\n00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.560\nIt's the justification.\n\n311\n00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.935\n&gt;&gt; My justification is bad?\n\n312\n00:15:28.935 --> 00:15:31.433\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it's not just the supply,\n\n313\n00:15:31.433 --> 00:15:35.560\nI wouldn't mind, but\ndidn't you see the last question?\n\n314\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.050\nI mean, didn't the last question, so hang\non and let me read this last question.\n\n315\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.932\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n316\n00:15:39.932 --> 00:15:42.266\n&gt;&gt; Didn't the last question\ntalk about supplier management?\n\n317\n00:15:42.266 --> 00:15:43.690\nYou don't remember that part?\n\n318\n00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.690\n&gt;&gt; I remember that one.\n\n319\n00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.201\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then.\nSo why are you thinking that business\n\n320\n00:15:47.201 --> 00:15:49.935\nrelationship management\ndeals with suppliers,\n\n321\n00:15:49.935 --> 00:15:52.027\nand supplier management wouldn't?\n\n322\n00:15:52.027 --> 00:15:54.257\n&gt;&gt; Well it deals with our customers too.\n\n323\n00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:56.770\n&gt;&gt; It deals with our customers, not too.\n\n324\n00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n&gt;&gt; It deals with our,\n\n325\n00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.167\nguess who deals with suppliers?\n\n326\n00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:02.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well I'm trying to\nbe nice to everyone here Jo.\n\n327\n00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.470\nAnd manage all of those relationships.\n\n328\n00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.090\nBut okay, so that's not...\n\n329\n00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.060\n&gt;&gt; She's been asleep.\n\n330\n00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.910\nShe's been asleep for all of this show.\n\n331\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.400\nShe's been sleeping.\n\n332\n00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so...\n\n333\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:13.920\n&gt;&gt; It's still A.\n\n334\n00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.120\nYou're still right.\n\n335\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.695\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n&gt;&gt; You're still right.\n\n336\n00:16:16.695 --> 00:16:18.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm gonna take my point,\nall right?\n\n337\n00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.994\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you can have it grudgingly.\n\n338\n00:16:23.994 --> 00:16:24.640\nIt is A.\nIt's\n\n339\n00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.870\ninterfacing with the relevant parties.\n\n340\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.910\nRelevant parties being I.T.\nor I.T. service provider and\n\n341\n00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.340\na customer now uses In\nthat customer environment.\n\n342\n00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.980\nContract, well, we're talking about\nmanaging contracts and performance.\n\n343\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.730\nThat would be suppliers,\nthat's legally binding contracts.\n\n344\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:48.240\nAnd yeah, the others are suppliers,\nthat are managed by supplier management.\n\n345\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:48.810\nGuess what?\n\n346\n00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.590\nLet's take a look at incident and\nproblem management,\n\n347\n00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.562\nplease somebody get me out of here.\n\n348\n00:16:55.562 --> 00:16:58.860\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nAnd so, incident and problem management\n\n349\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:04.805\nare the same process, could be the same\nprocess are separate processes.\n\n350\n00:17:04.805 --> 00:17:09.030\nIt depends on the nature of\nthe service provider if they would be\n\n351\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.480\nhandled as the same or separate process.\n\n352\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.140\nIncident and\nproblem management are separate processes.\n\n353\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.100\n&gt;&gt; I have been known to take\n\n354\n00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.550\npeople outside with a baseball bat\ndepending on the answer to this question.\n\n355\n00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.980\nBy the way.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My gosh, so\n\n356\n00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.780\nam I in for a beating?\n\n357\n00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.690\n&gt;&gt; No pressure.\n\n358\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.778\n&gt;&gt; Am I in for a beating here?\n\n359\n00:17:31.778 --> 00:17:33.651\n&gt;&gt; It depends on the answer.\n\n360\n00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:36.770\n&gt;&gt; C.\n\n361\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.210\n&gt;&gt; They are separate processes, yes!\n\n362\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.295\n&gt;&gt; I don't get beat today!\n\n363\n00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:42.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n364\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.400\nshe doesn't get taken outside\nwith a baseball bat today.\n\n365\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.545\nWell, that is a sigh of relief.\n\n366\n00:17:46.545 --> 00:17:47.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they are,\n\n367\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.890\nthey're separate processes.\n\n368\n00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.700\nThey have to be handled\nas separate processes.\n\n369\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.520\nAnd I know that we mentioned this\nearlier in one of the episodes.\n\n370\n00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.050\nAbout the fact that you\ncan't combine these.\n\n371\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.050\nIncident management is about restoring\nnormal service operation as quickly as\n\n372\n00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.060\npossible.\n\n373\n00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.330\nAnd problem management is about\nfinding out what went wrong.\n\n374\n00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.060\nThese are two completely\nseparate entities.\n\n375\n00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:13.410\nWhat I can tell you is if\nyou go into the ITIL shows,\n\n376\n00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.610\nand you take a look at the ITIL\nservice operation show.\n\n377\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.550\nThere is actually an episode that,\nvery short episode.\n\n378\n00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:25.990\nThat actually describes the interaction\nbetween incidents and problems.\n\n379\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.000\nNow, this is not something\nthat Cherokee has watched.\n\n380\n00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.210\nThis is something that Ronnie was involved\nwith with me and so Ronnie was by my\n\n381\n00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:39.200\nside throughout this one so I'll kind of\nlet you off, but yes, there is an episode\n\n382\n00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.490\nthere that will describe the difference\nbetween the incident and the process.\n\n383\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.120\n&gt;&gt; Well I do remember how upset you\ngot when I said disaster recovery\n\n384\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.075\ninstead of continuity.\n\n385\n00:18:48.075 --> 00:18:48.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n386\n00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.490\nI could get very upset very, very quickly\nwhen you use the wrong terminology.\n\n387\n00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.010\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n388\n00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.560\nSo I'm trying to be careful here.\n\n389\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.229\n&gt;&gt; I told you that people find\nme scary and I don't know why.\n\n390\n00:19:02.229 --> 00:19:03.080\nI'm nice.\n&gt;&gt; Two more.\n\n391\n00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.660\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at number nine then.\n\n392\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:09.130\nWhat can be excluded from\nconfiguration management?\n\n393\n00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.850\nWhich could be excluded from\nconfiguration management.\n\n394\n00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.460\n&gt;&gt; The relationship between\nconfiguration items no.\n\n395\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.290\nThat's a big no.\n\n396\n00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.452\nOkay.\n\n397\n00:19:19.452 --> 00:19:22.600\nAll right, so\nA is a no that can not be excluded.\n\n398\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.900\nB the request for change no.\n\n399\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.020\nC, the financial management\nof configuration items, or\n\n400\n00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.070\nD, none of the above.\n\n401\n00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.660\nSo we know it's not D because\nwe definitely have A and B.\n\n402\n00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.350\nSo I guess that leaves me with C.\n\n403\n00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.670\nAnd I will fall back on that adage\nthat if you don't know then go with C.\n\n404\n00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.150\nBut I'm pretty sure it's C.\n\n405\n00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.860\n&gt;&gt; It is C!\n\n406\n00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.730\nI don't like the,\nif you don't know go with C, though.\n\n407\n00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.780\nBut yeah, it is C.\n\n408\n00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.329\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm just joking guys.\n\n409\n00:19:50.329 --> 00:19:53.836\nThat's not a legitimate test style there.\n\n410\n00:19:53.836 --> 00:19:57.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's just something, it's a rumor.\n\n411\n00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.660\nYeah well I've heard various techniques.\n\n412\n00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.770\nLike if you don't know the answer\ngo with all of the above, and\n\n413\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.420\nit's certainly, well there's not\nan option for that in this one.\n\n414\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.780\nWhat I can tell you about this is that of\ncourse if you remember from a previous\n\n415\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.680\nepisode, we're certainly not going to\nbe auditing on financial management and\n\n416\n00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.250\nhow you procure.\n\n417\n00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.530\nAnd how you select suppliers\nthat's completely up to you.\n\n418\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.280\nAnd the financial management\nof configuration items.\n\n419\n00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.500\nWell that's dealt with in accounting and\nin budgeting\n\n420\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.900\nbecause financial management would\ninvolve things like depreciation, etc so.\n\n421\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:33.550\nThat's not something that we would look at\nwithin configuration management itself.\n\n422\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.210\nOkay, so we're getting there.\n\n423\n00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.330\nWe're getting there.\n\n424\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.300\nNearly, the last one.\n\n425\n00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.650\nIn fact, here we are at the last one then.\n\n426\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.420\nThe very last question.\n\n427\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.340\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n428\n00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.661\nThe number of personnel and\nthe experience and\n\n429\n00:20:46.661 --> 00:20:51.688\nqualification of the personnel\nassigned to conduct an audit should be\n\n430\n00:20:51.688 --> 00:20:57.308\ndependent on the scope of the audit,\nthe time available to perform the audit,\n\n431\n00:20:57.308 --> 00:21:00.745\nthe purpose of the audit,\nand all of the above.\n\n432\n00:21:00.745 --> 00:21:01.245\nHm.\n\n433\n00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.558\nAll right, there's not really\na set time to perform the audit.\n\n434\n00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:10.450\nIt's not like like we have a window there,\nas we had talked about that.\n\n435\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.710\nIt can be different, it can vary.\n\n436\n00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:17.951\nThe scope can vary and\nthe purpose that defines\n\n437\n00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:22.420\nin this scope so that can vary also.\n\n438\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.359\nSo...\n\n439\n00:21:29.954 --> 00:21:31.825\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's see.\n\n440\n00:21:31.825 --> 00:21:33.335\nThe number personnel and\nthe experience and\n\n441\n00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:38.945\nqualifications of personnel assigned to\nconduct an audit should be dependent on.\n\n442\n00:21:38.945 --> 00:21:41.715\nSince I really can't define\nthose other three things,\n\n443\n00:21:41.715 --> 00:21:43.335\nI guess I say all of the above.\n\n444\n00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:47.400\nBecause they all have\nthe same weight in my mind.\n\n445\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.098\n&gt;&gt; Is this because of exam technique?\n\n446\n00:21:49.098 --> 00:21:49.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n447\n00:21:49.985 --> 00:21:54.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm hauling back on that,\n\n448\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.500\nJo, sorry, but yeah.\n\n449\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.110\nI'm sure you have a better reason.\n\n450\n00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.710\n&gt;&gt; RTFQ,\nyes of course I've got a better reason.\n\n451\n00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.950\nRead the full question.\n\n452\n00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.357\n&gt;&gt; Read the full question?\n\n453\n00:22:03.357 --> 00:22:05.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThe number of people, and\n\n454\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.425\nthe experience that\nthey've got assigned...\n\n455\n00:22:07.425 --> 00:22:11.970\nSo the experience that they've\ngot to be assigned to anything\n\n456\n00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.500\nis always dependent on what it\nis you're asking them to do.\n\n457\n00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.484\nAnd how long it's going to take them\nto do it and what the purpose is.\n\n458\n00:22:18.484 --> 00:22:19.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are all variables.\n\n459\n00:22:19.095 --> 00:22:19.595\nThat's what-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n460\n00:22:19.595 --> 00:22:20.685\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n461\n00:22:20.685 --> 00:22:22.115\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n462\n00:22:22.115 --> 00:22:27.005\nSo of course, the question simply says\nto you, how many people you need and\n\n463\n00:22:27.005 --> 00:22:29.878\nwhat their skills are is gonna\nbe completely depending on what?\n\n464\n00:22:29.878 --> 00:22:33.760\nWell it's completely depending on\nwhat you're asking them to do,\n\n465\n00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.060\nand how long you're asking them to\ndo this for and for what reason.\n\n466\n00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.270\nSo yeah, the answer is all of the above.\n\n467\n00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.490\nNot just because of the exam technique.\n\n468\n00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:46.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know if I'm ready\nto take the exam yet, but at least I\n\n469\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.940\ncan hit the rewind button and go back and-\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're on track for a pass.\n\n470\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n471\n00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.560\n&gt;&gt; How are you doing?\n\n472\n00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.850\nAre you on track for a pass at this rate?\n\n473\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:23:01.930\nDon't forget, you've only gotta get 65%,\nso 26 out of 40, in order to pass.\n\n474\n00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.274\nSo you're on track for a pass.\n\n475\n00:23:06.274 --> 00:23:11.560\nI'd prefer it if you got 100%,\nbut beggars can't be choosers.\n\n476\n00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.570\nThat's what I was always\ntaught when I was a kid.\n\n477\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.950\nWe'll go with what we got.\n\n478\n00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.700\nThink about common sense.\n\n479\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.030\nIf there are any concepts you're not too\nsure of about any of the processes that\n\n480\n00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.010\nwe have covered, and\nhow to implement some of these processes.\n\n481\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.580\nThen I would refer you\nback to the ITIL episode.\n\n482\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:36.340\nAnd go and take a look at our ITIL shows,\nand look at ITIL foundation,\n\n483\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.400\nand look at the various\nlifecycle phases within ITIL.\n\n484\n00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.010\nAnd that'll certainly\ngive you an understanding\n\n485\n00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.520\nof the best practice framework that,\nof course, you then have to adopt and\n\n486\n00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:51.350\nadapt in your organization, so\nthat you can achieve ISO 20000.\n\n487\n00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:55.350\nSo what the actual processes\nwould look like, well,\n\n488\n00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:59.590\nas I said, go back to ITIL and\ntake a look at some of these processes.\n\n489\n00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.120\nAnd that will give you the objective\nof some of these processes.\n\n490\n00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.750\nWhat we're auditing against,\n\n491\n00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.860\nthat's what we've covered as part\nof our ISO 20000 foundation.\n\n492\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo so\n\n493\n00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:13.320\nI think just a little bit more studying\nin then we should be ready to go and\n\n494\n00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.640\nset that exam and at least have the\nconfidence to go through an audit process.\n\n495\n00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.300\nSo I appreciate your time and effort with\nthis series, and I appreciate you for\n\n496\n00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.470\nhanging out with us also.\n\n497\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.010\nBut that's it for\nthis particular series and\n\n498\n00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.210\nwe will go ahead and\nbid you a final adieu here.\n\n499\n00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.652\nI am going to sign out as\nyour host Cherokee Buss.\n\n500\n00:24:30.652 --> 00:24:32.579\nAnd I, Jo [INAUDIBLE].\n\n501\n00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:34.041\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n502\n00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:40.560\n[MUSIC]\n\n503\n00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.076\n[MUSIC]\n\n504\n00:24:41.076 --> 00:24:44.232\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",
