00:00:06.282\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:08.243\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:11.857\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:14.330\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.760\nHelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.270\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\nthis episode of ITIL Executive Overview.\n\n9\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.990\nBenefits of Service Management\nis the name of this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.595\nlet's find out more from\nour expert Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:33.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, there's an introduction,\nyeah that was a scary introduction.\n\n12\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.488\nZach, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:34.488 --> 00:00:35.530\n&gt;&gt; Good, doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.870\nAnd this is very exciting,\nbeginning of a little miniseries here.\n\n15\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.829\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, normally when we are in\na sort of a classroom environment, for\n\n16\n00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.080\ninstance, then we would quite often get,\nor\n\n17\n00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.360\nI would quite often get asked to\nprovide overviews for executive levels.\n\n18\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.940\nPeople that didn't necessarily wanna\ngo on an ITIL foundation course.\n\n19\n00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.881\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or people that,\n\n20\n00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:00.740\nbecause I mean that's a three day course.\n\n21\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.040\nThat's a three day class, they didn't\nnecessarily want the accreditation.\n\n22\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.860\nBut also they want to understand more\nabout what the benefits of ITIL are, and\n\n23\n00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.750\nwhat the benefits of implementing\na service management framework are.\n\n24\n00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.020\nSo really, the intention of\nthis particular series is to,\n\n25\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.140\nand it is a very short series so\nwe can call it a miniseries,\n\n26\n00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.670\nis just to really go over what we would\nnormally do in an executive overview,\n\n27\n00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.530\nwhich is take a look a the benefits\nof service management.\n\n28\n00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.480\nAnd I don't just mean sort of\nthe hypothetical benefits.\n\n29\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.370\nI don't mean the theoretical benefits.\n\n30\n00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.940\nWhat I actually mean\nare the tangible benefits as well.\n\n31\n00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.020\nWhat you expect to achieve by or\nthe benefits\n\n32\n00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.380\nyou expect to realize by implementing\nthe service management framework.\n\n33\n00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.075\nAnd so that's what I wanted to\ndo in this particular series.\n\n34\n00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.935\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's the takeaway from this course.\n\n35\n00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:56.855\n&gt;&gt; Well not just that, but it's also\na look at sort of ITIL as a framework.\n\n36\n00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:59.795\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So in our first episode we're going to\n\n37\n00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:04.215\nreview the actual tangible benefits\nfrom implementing the service\n\n38\n00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:05.725\nmanagement framework.\n\n39\n00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.412\nAnd then in our subsequent episodes,\n\n40\n00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:11.010\nwe're just going to look at the ITIL\nframework in a little bit more depth.\n\n41\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're not going to go to the depth\n\n42\n00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.210\nthat's needed for an ITIL foundation\nclass, because obviously we've got an ITIL\n\n43\n00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.400\nfoundation series and we really don't need\nto repeat all of that, but we are aware.\n\n44\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.710\nAnd I'm perfectly aware because\nof the queries that I get,\n\n45\n00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.150\nthat there are those out there that don't\nnecessarily want to take an accredited\n\n46\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.290\nclass but that simply want to have\nan understanding of ITIL itself.\n\n47\n00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.990\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so for\n\n48\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.240\nthe first part of this particular series\nwe're going to be looking at benefits, and\n\n49\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.840\nthen in the second part of this\nseries we're gonna spend some time,\n\n50\n00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.510\na few episodes, just looking at\nour ITIL processes themselves.\n\n51\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.180\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; And just a really quick recap over\n\n52\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.230\nwhat those processes are,\njust a synopsis of ITIL.\n\n53\n00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.920\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n54\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.020\n&gt;&gt; But when I talk about the benefits,\n\n55\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.680\nI'm not just talking about\nthe benefits of ITIL though.\n\n56\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.659\nAnd I think that's something that\nI kind of want to make clear\n\n57\n00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.810\nright at the very start, we are not\ntalking about benefits of just ITIL.\n\n58\n00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.390\nWe're talking about the benefits of\na structured service management framework.\n\n59\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n60\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.268\n&gt;&gt; What do you know about\nthe difference between or\n\n61\n00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:26.574\nthe relationship between service\nmanagement and project management?\n\n62\n00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:29.085\n[LAUGH] This is called putting\nhim on the spot, right.\n\n63\n00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:32.452\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Jo, I'm gonna defer to you on this one.\n\n64\n00:03:32.452 --> 00:03:35.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know that you know more than I.\n\n65\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.790\n&gt;&gt; Well the reason that I ask is because\nthere is an overlap between the two,\n\n66\n00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.640\nand we call that dev ops.\n\n67\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.330\nWe call that service transition, and we'll\ntake a look at it in a subsequent episode.\n\n68\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.655\nBut there is, as I said,\nthere is an overlap.\n\n69\n00:03:51.655 --> 00:03:55.790\nBut project management are responsible for\ncreating new services.\n\n70\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.145\nThey are responsible for\ndesigning and developing and\n\n71\n00:04:00.145 --> 00:04:04.695\nthen deploying new services\ninto the live environment.\n\n72\n00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:05.929\nAnd service management,\n\n73\n00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:09.019\nwell I like to think of service\nmanagement as the book end to that.\n\n74\n00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.196\nService management are the people that\nactually take a look at the strategy,\n\n75\n00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:16.340\nthey come up with the ideas for\nthe new services.\n\n76\n00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.499\nBut then what they'll also do, they'll\nhand that over to project management and\n\n77\n00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:23.405\nproject management design and\ndevelop and then deploy.\n\n78\n00:04:23.405 --> 00:04:28.280\nAnd then service management pick up\nthe new service and then they run it\n\n79\n00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.250\nas part of business as usual,\nas part of the operational perspective.\n\n80\n00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.190\nSo what we're going to be doing in\nthis particular series is we're going\n\n81\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.750\nto be just taking a look at\nthe operational side of things, so\n\n82\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.200\nthe business as usual side of things.\n\n83\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.420\nNow there is gonna be some\noverlap into project management.\n\n84\n00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.656\nAnd in fact there's actually going to be\nsome tenderals into project management\n\n85\n00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:57.597\nwhere we might not have the project\nmanagement guys pick up certain things.\n\n86\n00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:00.383\nAnd we might say, well look,\nthat still needs to happen.\n\n87\n00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:04.257\nAnd so because it still needs to happen,\nit's gonna happen at this point in time.\n\n88\n00:05:04.257 --> 00:05:08.790\nBut we're going to do it at the same time\nthat the project guys are going to do it.\n\n89\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.350\nOr we might ask the project\nguys do it own our behalf.\n\n90\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.380\nSo there is a synergy between the two.\n\n91\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.350\nI expect there to be teamwork,\nI expect it.\n\n92\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.280\nIf there's not,\nthen we've got a very disjointed IT team.\n\n93\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.390\nAnd I have to say, and I am gonna say\nthis, that that's actually quite common.\n\n94\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.420\nThat's not an unusual to have an IT team\nthat consists of two distinct sides.\n\n95\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.171\nAnd I hear this all the time,\nwhere we've got project team and\n\n96\n00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:49.280\nthe development guys, and then we have\ngot the service operation guys and\n\n97\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.380\nthe business as usual guys, and they're\nthe support guys as they're called.\n\n98\n00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.780\nSo the project guys build something and\nthen they kind of throw it over the wall\n\n99\n00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.840\nto the support guys, and the support guys\nhave got to deal with it afterwards.\n\n100\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.220\nYeah, that's not exactly how you want it.\n&gt;&gt; Not ideal.\n\n101\n00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.210\n&gt;&gt; No, what we want is a cohesive\nIT structure, that's what we want.\n\n102\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.570\nWe want collaboration between the two.\n\n103\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.320\nAnd in an ideal world there\nshouldn't be a barrier between them.\n\n104\n00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.830\nThey shouldn't be two separate teams.\n\n105\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.451\nThey should be two cohesive teams that\ncollaborate on not just on projects but\n\n106\n00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:25.242\nalso on support work as well.\n\n107\n00:06:25.242 --> 00:06:27.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we're aiming for.\n\n108\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.270\nAnd if we have service management and\nproject management implemented and\n\n109\n00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.350\nwe have a framework for both, and\n\n110\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.090\nyou'll actually find that that does\nwork and it works really well.\n\n111\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.140\nBut it also saves us money.\n\n112\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.840\nLet's face it,\nthat's what everybody wants, right.\n\n113\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.675\n&gt;&gt; I wanna make money.\n\n114\n00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:44.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Save money, ain't gonna happen.\n\n115\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.536\nMake money.\n[LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:47.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No Zach, you wanna save money.\n\n117\n00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.580\n&gt;&gt; I wanna save money.\n\n118\n00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes you do.\n\n119\n00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.760\n&gt;&gt; She's right.\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at some common\n\n120\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.120\ncomplaints for IT.\n\n121\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.570\nBecause what I'm really doing here\nis looking at the justification for\n\n122\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.960\nservice management.\n\n123\n00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.960\nNot just ITIL,\nwe're talking about things like SIAM and\n\n124\n00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.910\nwe're also talking about\n[INAUDIBLE] as well.\n\n125\n00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.270\nThere are other service\nmanagement frameworks out there.\n\n126\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.840\nAnd of course we already have, at the time\nof recording, we have a SIAM series.\n\n127\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.162\nWe are currently in production\nwith a series as well.\n\n128\n00:07:16.162 --> 00:07:22.510\nSo we are involved with all of the service\nmanagement frameworks and not just ITIL.\n\n129\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.510\nBut these are common\ncomplaints across the world,\n\n130\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.160\naround the world, just general complaints.\n\n131\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.860\nIf you think about, and this is just\nsort of market research, by the way.\n\n132\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.920\nThis is not something that\nwe have done ourselves.\n\n133\n00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.870\nWe've taken our information from\nplaces like Gartner and Forrester.\n\n134\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.619\nThis is just general market research.\n\n135\n00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:46.408\nDo you know that 21% of our organizations,\njust companies in general,\n\n136\n00:07:46.408 --> 00:07:49.224\nview IT as an expensive overhead?\n\n137\n00:07:49.224 --> 00:07:50.502\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n\n138\n00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:53.240\nI would have thought it would\nbe even higher than that.\n\n139\n00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's only 21%.\n\n140\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.652\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think a lot of organizations now,\n\n141\n00:07:56.652 --> 00:08:00.680\nif we were to turn the clock back\nto when ITIL first started, so\n\n142\n00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.313\nover 20 years ago now.\n\n143\n00:08:02.313 --> 00:08:03.361\n&gt;&gt; Way back in the day.\n\n144\n00:08:03.361 --> 00:08:07.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, when that first started,\nit would've been more than that.\n\n145\n00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:12.050\nBut now we recognize that IT is\nan integrated part of our industry.\n\n146\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.218\nBut nevertheless, they're still 21%, so\nthat's still quite high given that you're\n\n147\n00:08:16.218 --> 00:08:19.791\ntalking about the generation of people\nthat cannot leave their cell phones for\n\n148\n00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.720\nlonger than five minutes.\n\n149\n00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.107\nRight, and yet still 21% of people\nthink that it's just an overhead,\n\n150\n00:08:26.107 --> 00:08:27.466\nthat's quite scary.\n\n151\n00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:31.571\nAnd only 45% of people consider IT,\nthat's the IT team,\n\n152\n00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:35.619\nto be necessary because they-\n&gt;&gt; Thought that number would be higher\n\n153\n00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:36.136\nas well.\n\n154\n00:08:36.136 --> 00:08:40.577\n&gt;&gt; Well, no, I mean, I would have thought,\nwell, actually, yes, you're right.\n\n155\n00:08:40.577 --> 00:08:43.951\nBecause if only 45% consider\nIT to be necessary, I mean,\n\n156\n00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:47.335\nwe need IT to do absolutely\neverything in our organization.\n\n157\n00:08:47.335 --> 00:08:48.697\n&gt;&gt; To do absolutely everything.\n\n158\n00:08:48.697 --> 00:08:53.750\n&gt;&gt; You can't get into\nour building without IT.\n\n159\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.884\nYou can't get through a door,\nprobably in your building, without IT.\n\n160\n00:08:57.884 --> 00:09:02.757\nYou can't do anything without IT,\nIT sends and receives email,\n\n161\n00:09:02.757 --> 00:09:04.978\nIT sends and receives texts.\n\n162\n00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:07.368\nIt's IT that sends and\nreceives or makes and\n\n163\n00:09:07.368 --> 00:09:11.450\nreceives a phone call now because it's\nall VOIP, it's all voice over IP.\n\n164\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.737\nSo when you consider that IT is part\nof absolutely everything that we do,\n\n165\n00:09:17.737 --> 00:09:22.024\nand yet only 45% of organizations\nthink that they need it.\n\n166\n00:09:22.024 --> 00:09:22.685\n&gt;&gt; It's baffling.\n\n167\n00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:28.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, we all need it,\nand 100% of organizations use it.\n\n168\n00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.921\nWhat about, 32% of business users\nsee IT as a valued partner?\n\n169\n00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:37.640\nThat means that the rest of them see\nIT as something other than valued.\n\n170\n00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.213\n&gt;&gt; Like an errant cousin or something?\n\n171\n00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:43.556\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH] or even as a partner,\nI mean, consider this.\n\n172\n00:09:43.556 --> 00:09:48.575\nBecause IT is, well,\nit's a partnership with the organization,\n\n173\n00:09:48.575 --> 00:09:54.751\nand yet there's only 32% of business\nusers, that's people like you and Zach.\n\n174\n00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:58.806\nOnly 32% of people consider\nIT to be valuable.\n\n175\n00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:04.119\nThat's, yeah, and\n37% of business users perceive that\n\n176\n00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:09.128\nwhat we do in IT is lay down the law,\nthat's what it says.\n\n177\n00:10:09.128 --> 00:10:11.439\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What we do is constrain it,\n\n178\n00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:12.539\nthat's what we do.\n\n179\n00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:17.307\nAnd if it wasn't for the the IT team,\nwe'd be able to do whatever we wanted,\n\n180\n00:10:17.307 --> 00:10:19.853\nwhich is great, but there'd be chaos.\n\n181\n00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:21.920\nBut they don't perceive the value in that.\n\n182\n00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.235\nThey think that we constrain, and\nthey don't understand why we constrain.\n\n183\n00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:29.327\nAnd a lot of this is down to\nmiscommunication, by the way.\n\n184\n00:10:29.327 --> 00:10:33.546\nAnd again, that's something else\nthat is really something we\n\n185\n00:10:33.546 --> 00:10:37.935\ncan address by implementing\nthe service management framework.\n\n186\n00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.228\nAnd 14% of organizations, this is\nquite low compared to the others, and\n\n187\n00:10:43.228 --> 00:10:47.000\nI'm kind of impressed by this, but\nthen I'm not, because it worries me.\n\n188\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.070\n14% of organizations do not consider IT\nto be necessary for business advancement.\n\n189\n00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.782\nIn other words,\nwe could have grown without IT.\n\n190\n00:10:56.782 --> 00:11:00.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're talking about the guy\nthat sells brownies on the corner here,\n\n191\n00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:01.136\nI think [LAUGH].\n\n192\n00:11:01.136 --> 00:11:04.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know,\nbecause even he needs IT now.\n\n193\n00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.219\n&gt;&gt; No, I believe that, eveybody does.\n\n194\n00:11:06.219 --> 00:11:09.830\n&gt;&gt; Because if you're selling brownies,\nlet's just take him.\n\n195\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.718\nLet's say that here in the US,\nfor instance,\n\n196\n00:11:12.718 --> 00:11:17.917\nif you're selling brownies in the corner,\nthen you're making money out of that.\n\n197\n00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:20.860\nAnd that means that you've\ngotta pay taxes on that money.\n\n198\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.035\nGuess how you pay your taxes?\n\n199\n00:11:23.035 --> 00:11:29.960\nYou have to do this in IT,\nyou have to get on to the tax service.\n\n200\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.284\nWhether it's HMRC, whether it's the IRS,\nno matter who it is.\n\n201\n00:11:34.284 --> 00:11:40.190\nYour tax organization, your tax\ndepartment, you've gotta file your taxes.\n\n202\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.594\nSo to turn around and say that even\nthe guy, that's probably the guy on\n\n203\n00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:47.536\nthe street corner selling brownies, well,\nthe fact is that he needs IT as well.\n\n204\n00:11:47.536 --> 00:11:51.090\nAnd you can't tell me that\nhe doesn't have a cellphone.\n\n205\n00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.407\n&gt;&gt; Right, that and also,\nunless he's on social media,\n\n206\n00:11:54.407 --> 00:11:59.037\nhe's missing a huge portion of the market,\nhe could be reaching millions.\n\n207\n00:11:59.037 --> 00:12:00.849\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, and yet\n\n208\n00:12:00.849 --> 00:12:06.970\n14% of organizations don't consider\nthat they need IT to advance.\n\n209\n00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.640\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n&gt;&gt; That's still a huge amount, I mean,\n\n210\n00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.304\nI know it's lower than the rest,\nbut it's still a huge amount.\n\n211\n00:12:11.304 --> 00:12:13.314\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n212\n00:12:13.314 --> 00:12:15.785\n&gt;&gt; So I want to sort of point out here,\n\n213\n00:12:15.785 --> 00:12:20.320\nwe've got the stated benefit\nof implementing best practice.\n\n214\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.706\nAnd what that means is,\nin the ITIL publications,\n\n215\n00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:25.570\nand we'll talk about\nthem in a little while.\n\n216\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.910\nBut in the ITIL publications,\nwe have stated benefits.\n\n217\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.751\nIn other words, they say well,\nwhat we do in a service management\n\n218\n00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:38.107\nframework is provide\nvalue to the business.\n\n219\n00:12:38.107 --> 00:12:41.120\nZach knows something about value,\nwhat do you know about value, Zach?\n\n220\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.265\n&gt;&gt; Value is perceived.\n\n221\n00:12:43.265 --> 00:12:44.479\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay-\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n222\n00:12:44.479 --> 00:12:47.058\nyou didn't think I was gonna\ndo that did you [LAUGH]?\n\n223\n00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:52.310\n&gt;&gt; No, I was hoping you were, I didn't\nactually set him up for this, so I'm glad.\n\n224\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.164\nI didn't prepare him for\nthis, but value is perceived.\n\n225\n00:12:56.164 --> 00:12:58.859\nOne of the things that we miss out in IT,\n\n226\n00:12:58.859 --> 00:13:04.820\nwe're not very good at selling ourselves\nin IT, by the way, did you know that?\n\n227\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.113\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I imagined so.\n\n228\n00:13:06.113 --> 00:13:09.959\n&gt;&gt; We're not,\nwe tend to be the kind of people, I mean,\n\n229\n00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:14.170\nyou've seen that just looking\nat the previous slide.\n\n230\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.259\nWe tend to be the departments and\nthe teams that will just sort of sit in\n\n231\n00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:21.163\nthe corner and\njust quietly get on with our work.\n\n232\n00:13:21.163 --> 00:13:25.234\nAnd we're not very good at selling\nourselves, we're not very good at saying,\n\n233\n00:13:25.234 --> 00:13:28.450\nthis is what we've achieved,\nthis is what we've done.\n\n234\n00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.064\nAnd because of us,\nyou have been to achieve this.\n\n235\n00:13:32.064 --> 00:13:35.199\nWe don't do that, we just wait for\nthem to ask us for something, and\n\n236\n00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:39.160\nthen we tend to give it to them and say,\nthere you go, that's what you asked for.\n\n237\n00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.350\nOr, no, you can't have what you asked for,\nbut we've given you this instead.\n\n238\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:48.273\nAnd we're not very good at sort of\narticulating why it's been like that.\n\n239\n00:13:48.273 --> 00:13:50.353\nWe're really not good at that, so\n\n240\n00:13:50.353 --> 00:13:55.088\nwhen we talk about providing value in\nthe form of goods or services, you will be\n\n241\n00:13:55.088 --> 00:13:59.280\namazed by how many organizations\ndon't appreciate the value of IT.\n\n242\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.640\nAnd it's simply because\nwe're just not very good at\n\n243\n00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.580\narticulating how valuable we are.\n\n244\n00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.582\nWe should be in a position where we\nintegrate IT with the business strategy.\n\n245\n00:14:11.582 --> 00:14:15.542\nIn other words, whatever the business\nis decided is a strategy,\n\n246\n00:14:15.542 --> 00:14:19.430\nthen IT shouldn't be running,\nbehind picking up the pieces and\n\n247\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:23.120\ntrying to catch up,\nIT should be leading that now.\n\n248\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.364\nLike I've said, without IT,\nyou can't even get through the front door.\n\n249\n00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:31.810\nSo IT should be leading the strategy,\nthey should be driving the strategy.\n\n250\n00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:37.240\nAnd in fact, they should be the ones that\nsit in on the board of any organization\n\n251\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.840\nand say, hey look, we've got this new\ntechnology, we can do this for you.\n\n252\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.620\nWhat we're also able to do, by the way\nwith implementing best practice,\n\n253\n00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.245\nis with a framework, we can control cost.\n\n254\n00:14:50.245 --> 00:14:56.320\nA lot of IT organizations,\na lot of IT departments,\n\n255\n00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.590\nfor instance, that, and\nwe call them service providers in ITIL.\n\n256\n00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:05.480\nBut there are a lot of IT departments\nthat don't really have a good handle,\n\n257\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.070\nshould I say, on cost.\n\n258\n00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.764\nHow much money is being spent and\nwhere it's being spent.\n\n259\n00:15:11.764 --> 00:15:15.576\nAnd what we do is,\nwe take a budget from the organization and\n\n260\n00:15:15.576 --> 00:15:19.720\nwe're actually seen as a cost\ncenter to the organization.\n\n261\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:25.050\nWhen in fact, if we can demonstrate\nthat we are delivering value,\n\n262\n00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.393\nthen we should be seen as a profit center.\n\n263\n00:15:28.393 --> 00:15:32.959\nSo a lot of implementing service\nmanagement allows you to\n\n264\n00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:38.100\ntake the cost center, and\nturn that into a profit center.\n\n265\n00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.150\nSo we're no longer just a cost,\nwe're no longer a drain on the budget, but\n\n266\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.610\nwe're actually seen as driving\na profit for the organization.\n\n267\n00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:53.646\nIt's a huge change in perspective, that's\nwhat we should be aiming to achieve,\n\n268\n00:15:53.646 --> 00:15:58.266\nand that's what you can achieve\nby implementing best practice,\n\n269\n00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:00.455\nas well as management of risk.\n\n270\n00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:04.961\nIt's all about implementing efficient and\neffective processes.\n\n271\n00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:11.485\nNow efficiency means Doing it\nright the first time, by golly.\n\n272\n00:16:11.485 --> 00:16:16.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, it doesn't, we talked\nabout this, Zach, you know we have.\n\n273\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.045\nAnd not just prior to this\nparticular episode, but\n\n274\n00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:19.447\nwe have talked about this at length.\n\n275\n00:16:19.447 --> 00:16:21.810\nAnd efficiency means minimal waste.\n\n276\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:28.105\nAnd in service management terms,\nit means achieving an outcome,\n\n277\n00:16:28.105 --> 00:16:31.918\nthat's being effected with well,\nminimal waste.\n\n278\n00:16:31.918 --> 00:16:36.170\nMinimal waste in terms of time, so\nas quickly as you possibly can.\n\n279\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.930\nMinimal waste in terms of money,\nas cheaply as you possibly can.\n\n280\n00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.870\nBut minimal waste in terms of scale,\n\n281\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.260\nfinding the right person\nto do the right job.\n\n282\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.450\n&gt;&gt; Which is exactly what I meant\nby doing it right the first time.\n\n283\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.620\n&gt;&gt; Did you know that having somebody\noverskilled doing a particular job\n\n284\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.760\nis just as inefficient as having\nsomebody who is underskilled.\n\n285\n00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we talked about that before.\n\n286\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.630\n&gt;&gt; We have talked about this\nbefore in one of our other series.\n\n287\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.440\nWe have talked about this.\n\n288\n00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.950\nBecause the person that is overskilled\n\n289\n00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.140\nis generally not going to be giving\n100% to that particular task at hand.\n\n290\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.920\nThey're probably gonna be distracted,\nI can do this with my eyes closed.\n\n291\n00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.070\nThey're gonna be distracted.\n\n292\n00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.990\nWhereas the person that's\nunderskilled at least is going to be\n\n293\n00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.450\ntrying to deliver 100%.\n\n294\n00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.840\nNow, nevertheless they're\ngoing to be slightly\n\n295\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:36.120\nbehind in terms of productivity because\nthey need the necessary skills.\n\n296\n00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.260\nBut the person that's overskilled\nis going to miss things as well.\n\n297\n00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.010\nThey're not gonna give 100%.\n\n298\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.190\nSo either one are just as\ninefficient as the other.\n\n299\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.130\nSo we need to have somebody who has\nthe right skill level to do the right\n\n300\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:48.810\nactivity.\n\n301\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.320\n&gt;&gt; Like the age old expression,\noverqualified.\n\n302\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.570\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, it's really dangerous\nto have somebody that's overqualified.\n\n303\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.660\nYou might think that it's a great idea,\nbut it's not.\n\n304\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.050\nThey're gonna get bored very, very easily\nand they're not going to give you 100%.\n\n305\n00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.080\nSo we talk about efficient and\neffective processes.\n\n306\n00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.640\nAnd effective processes means actually\ndoing what it's suppose to do and\n\n307\n00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.830\ndelivering the output that\nit's suppose to deliver.\n\n308\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.480\nWe want to have continual\nimprovement embedded into\n\n309\n00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.450\nsort of the business as usual,\nand in normal operations.\n\n310\n00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.300\nContinual improvement means that\nwe continually, in other words,\n\n311\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.350\non a regular basis,\nit's an iterative approach.\n\n312\n00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.130\nWe have an iterative\napproach to assessing and\n\n313\n00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:37.040\nevaluating ourselves as IT and\nevaluating whether we\n\n314\n00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:42.220\nare delivering value to the business\nthat's about improving quality.\n\n315\n00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.350\nBut it's really about\nensuring that we remain\n\n316\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.050\naligned to the needs of the business.\n\n317\n00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.300\nThat's what we need to do.\n\n318\n00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:56.189\nSo improvement to the business, or\nrather business benefits of bringing in IT\n\n319\n00:18:56.189 --> 00:19:01.210\nservice management, means that in\nan organization, we've got a handle on IT.\n\n320\n00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.750\nWe know what IT is doing.\n\n321\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.490\nAnd we are able to make better\ndecisions on our strategy,\n\n322\n00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.430\nbased on what IT can provide us\nbecause we have faith in IT.\n\n323\n00:19:12.695 --> 00:19:16.330\nIf IT understand the organization,\n\n324\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.910\nthen the organization can be\nmore agile in the market place.\n\n325\n00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.900\nBecause again,\nthey have that trust with IT, but\n\n326\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.390\nIT is also working for the business.\n\n327\n00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.620\nIT is not a constraint,\n\n328\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:35.001\nIt means that because IT understands\nwhat the business is trying to achieve,\n\n329\n00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:39.820\nwe can be efficient and\neffective at providing efficient services.\n\n330\n00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.990\nIn other words,\nimproving their productivity.\n\n331\n00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.670\nAnd again, having efficient and\neffective methods and processes for\n\n332\n00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.620\nmanaging our suppliers means that we\nhave rationalized sourcing as well.\n\n333\n00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.710\nBecause we're able to do it here in IT.\n\n334\n00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:01.308\nWe are able to the business,\nwith a structured framework,\n\n335\n00:20:01.308 --> 00:20:05.487\nwith efficient and\neffective consistent processes,\n\n336\n00:20:05.487 --> 00:20:10.685\nwe are able to deliver competitive\nadvantage to the organization.\n\n337\n00:20:10.685 --> 00:20:15.662\nAnd in IT, what that means for us is that\nif we have got a structured, consistent,\n\n338\n00:20:15.662 --> 00:20:18.116\nefficient, and effective framework,\n\n339\n00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:21.745\nit means that we actually get\na reduction in support cause.\n\n340\n00:20:21.745 --> 00:20:24.005\nIt means that our resolution rates go up.\n\n341\n00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:26.135\nIt means that we can implement\nmore successful changes.\n\n342\n00:20:26.135 --> 00:20:29.105\nAnd again,\nwe can make better sourcing decisions.\n\n343\n00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:34.730\nAnd then when we say, I just wanna go\nback to that more succesful changes,\n\n344\n00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:39.560\nI also want to bring in the increased\nvolume of changes as well.\n\n345\n00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.700\nBecause if our processes are more\nefficient and we have a consistent way\n\n346\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.130\nof managing change, then actually we\ncan handle a higher volume of change.\n\n347\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.830\nAnd something else that we do too with\nconsistency is bringing a common language.\n\n348\n00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.500\nThis is a huge, big benefit to IT.\n\n349\n00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.730\nBecause it means that\nour IT teams are talking\n\n350\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:07.235\nto each other in a common language,\nbut it also means that our IT\n\n351\n00:21:07.235 --> 00:21:12.860\nteams are able to talk to all of\ntheir suppliers in a common language.\n\n352\n00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:19.292\nBecause if I consider ITIL itself as\na service management framework then, let's\n\n353\n00:21:19.292 --> 00:21:25.830\njust say that ITIL is the most globally\nrecognized service management framework.\n\n354\n00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.630\nWell, I said globally, in the world.\n\n355\n00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.380\nIt's the most widespread\nservice management frame work.\n\n356\n00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.710\nIf you are a supplier, or a vendor,\nand you are trying to bid for\n\n357\n00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.340\na particular contract say within the\ngovernment, anywhere around the world you\n\n358\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.320\nhave to demonstrate that you\nare working to an ITIL framework.\n\n359\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.600\nThat you understand service management,\nand\n\n360\n00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.740\nthat you are working to best practices.\n\n361\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:54.540\nBut actually you are therefore\nable to demonstrate that\n\n362\n00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.800\nyou make best use of the tax payers\nmoney that's being given to you.\n\n363\n00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.660\nSo there is actually a requirement if\nyou want to be a supplier to government,\n\n364\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.410\nthat you work to a best\npractice framework.\n\n365\n00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.953\nWell if that's a requirement then that\nmeans that they're working in a certain\n\n366\n00:22:11.953 --> 00:22:15.360\nway and they want to make sure\nyou're working in a certain way.\n\n367\n00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.481\nSo we're all using\nthe same common language,\n\n368\n00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:23.400\nwe all have exactly\nthe same way of working.\n\n369\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.590\nUltimately, efficiency leads to\nhigher customer satisfaction,\n\n370\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.030\nthat's what it is that we are aiming for.\n\n371\n00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.130\nAnd so\nwhy do we want to adopt ITIL itself, then?\n\n372\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.500\nWell, ITIL is pretty much the same as\nany other service management framework.\n\n373\n00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.845\nBut as I've said, ITIL is the most\nglobally recognized, should we say.\n\n374\n00:22:47.845 --> 00:22:51.481\nAnd what you do with ITIL,\nis you adopt it, and\n\n375\n00:22:51.481 --> 00:22:54.670\nyou adapt it to suit your organization.\n\n376\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.509\nSo, it will help you to\nimprove your overall quality,\n\n377\n00:22:58.509 --> 00:23:03.432\nit will help you to control costs,\nand it will help you to align service\n\n378\n00:23:03.432 --> 00:23:07.790\nmanagement to the business and\nalign IT to the organization.\n\n379\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.840\n&gt;&gt; And Jo, at the beginning of the show\nyou mentioned tangible reasons, and\n\n380\n00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.320\nthat you'd give us some numbers,\nso where are we at with that?\n\n381\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did, yeah.\n\n382\n00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.230\nBut, right, well I'll just taking\na look at the time, actually.\n\n383\n00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.590\nAnd so what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna\nleave you with a little bit of a teaser.\n\n384\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.470\nSo we're gonna come back in a part two,\n\n385\n00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.682\nand we're gonna talk\nabout that in part two.\n\n386\n00:23:27.682 --> 00:23:31.400\n&gt;&gt; Part two of ITIL Executive Overview.\n\n387\n00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.920\nBenefits of Service Management, part two\ncoming your way, this has been part one.\n\n388\n00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.730\nMake sure you watch everything in\nthe ITIL Executive Overview series,\n\n389\n00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.500\nyou're gonna be very glad that you did.\n\n390\n00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.870\nAnd by the way, you'll also be

check that out as well.\n\n393\n00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.900\nWell, what do you know about ITProTV.\n\n394\n00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.860\nITProTV is binge-worthy, thanks for\nwatching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n395\n00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.376\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n396\n00:23:52.376 --> 00:23:53.990\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again very soon.\n\n397\n00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:59.510\n[MUSIC]\n\n398\n00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.030\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",
