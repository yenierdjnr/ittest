          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.365\n[NOISE] In this segment, we'll be\n\n2\n00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:09.325\ntaking a look at what we can expect from\n\n3\n00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:14.446\nour upcoming ITIL Foundation series.\n\n4\n00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:17.785\nNow, Terry, you've joined us, so\ngraciously, and we thank you for that.\n\n5\n00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:21.195\nWhy don't we go ahead and start with\nwho is the intended audience for\n\n6\n00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:22.455\nthis upcoming series?\n\n7\n00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:23.638\n>> It's a good question.\n\n8\n00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:26.575\nITIL covers a wide range of topics.\n\n9\n00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:28.110\nThis is the foundation course.\n\n10\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.220\nSo it actually can target anybody\nthat works in IT, whether you work\n\n11\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.830\nin operations in a day to day function or\nwhether you are an executive\n\n12\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.830\nthat works at the strategic functions and\nall points in between.\n\n13\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.920\nA lot of organizations adopt ITIL\n\n14\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.520\nto expand the organization\nacross various functions.\n\n15\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.140\nSo if you are an IT,\nthis is the topic for you.\n\n16\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.480\n>> All right, well if you're looking for\nthe Cisco class, this isn't then, right?\n\n17\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.570\nSo now that we know who is\nactually looking at this\n\n18\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.870\nwhy don't you give us a general idea\nof what we can expect from the series.\n\n19\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.660\n>> Sure, one way I describe this to lay\npeople that ask me, what do you do.\n\n20\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.960\nAnd I tell them I'm an ITEL instructor.\n\n21\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.580\nIt's effectively, business skills for\nIT people, right?\n\n22\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.000\nIt describes ITIL functions as\nthey relate to the business.\n\n23\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.570\nAnd I can give you a brief overview,\nhere on the slide here.\n\n24\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.550\nIn that, it starts with\nan overall description of ITIL.\n\n25\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.630\nBut then it digs in to service strategy,\nit moves to service design,\n\n26\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.150\nservice transition, service operation.\n\n27\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.630\nAnd then wraps it up with fundamentals\nof continual service improvement.\n\n28\n00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.950\nSo as you can tell it is\ncovering a wide expanse of detail\n\n29\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.420\nat a foundation level which means that\nyou're going to get a superficial\n\n30\n00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.160\nrendering of the entire ITL course books.\n\n31\n00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.150\n>> All right and anything specific that\nyou want to say about what we're going to\n\n32\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.900\nlearn in the series itself?\n\n33\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.200\n>> Yeah,\nI think the way to approach this is that,\n\n34\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.390\nunderstand you're gonna have\nsome self study, right?\n\n35\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.150\nAnd while you'll get a lot\nof good information and\n\n36\n00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.450\nconceptual hooks to hang this knowledge\non when you go through the episodes.\n\n37\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.360\nYour self study is gonna be important and\n\n38\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.350\nthe primary way to do your self study\nis to focus on some practice exams.\n\n39\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.170\nAnd there's two available,\nI'm showing you an example now,\n\n40\n00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.130\nhappens to be called sample papers,\nthey're practice exams.\n\n41\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.520\nSample Paper C and\nI'm just scrolling through here.\n\n42\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.310\nYou can see that the exam ends up being\n40 questions, this mimics the real exam.\n\n43\n00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.450\nSo obviously, they're not the exact\nsame questions, but this is very similar\n\n44\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.380\nin format, and complexity and it covers\nthe same concepts as the real exam will.\n\n45\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.620\nAnd you've got two of these.\n\n46\n00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.160\nAnd these also are accompanied\nby the answers to the exam, so\n\n47\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.270\nif you take sample paper C you also get\nanother handout that has the answers and\n\n48\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.880\nthe rationale for\nwhy that answer is correct.\n\n49\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.360\nAnd at the foundation level the rationale\nis It's because it's correct a lot,\n\n50\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.880\nit's the right answer, right.\n\n51\n00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.920\nNot necessarily a full blown explanation.\n\n52\n00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.370\nSo, I think be ready to do your\nself study these two practice\n\n53\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.460\nexams are gonna be the key methods of\nthat sell study and review, all right.\n\n54\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.970\nAnd you can use the answers and\n\n55\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.730\nthe rational to reinforce what\nyou've learned through the episodes.\n\n56\n00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.700\n>> I guess the final\nquestion I would have for\n\n57\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.820\nyou is can you tell us a little\nbit about the exam itself?\n\n58\n00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.230\nWhat can we expect as test takers,\nthe time constraints,\n\n59\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.310\nquestions, signing up,\nanything you can think of?\n\n60\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.420\n>> Sure, we'll there's 40 questions on the\nexam and you get 60 minutes to take it.\n\n61\n00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.690\nThat average about a minute and\na half, well exactly a minute and\n\n62\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.080\na half per question.\n\n63\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.050\nSo it's a pretty good clip, you just\nroll through the exam and answer them.\n\n64\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.870\nAnd it's the type of exam that it's only\ntesting at, it's testing your knowledge.\n\n65\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.550\nIt's not testing your\nability to analyze and\n\n66\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.790\nimplement ITIL,\nit really is a lot of recall.\n\n67\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.240\nSo, there's a lot of wrote\nmemorization involved and\n\n68\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.870\nconceptual awareness as opposed to\ndeep dive analysis and synthesis.\n\n69\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.490\nRight, so, it's pretty quick.\n\n70\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.300\nThere's only one right answer for\neach one.\n\n71\n00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.470\nYou gotta get 26 out of the 40,\n\n72\n00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.580\nso the bar is not super high,\n65% that turns out to be.\n\n73\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.670\n26 questions correct out of 40 and\n\n74\n00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.200\nyou are considered certified\nat the foundation level.\n\n75\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.675\nThat's how the exam looks.\n\n76\n00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:21.570\nAnd the downloads that are available\nif you look around the screen.\n\n77\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.890\nYou'll get a choice to\ndownload the episode files.\n\n78\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.530\nThose practice exams are zipped\nup in there so you can get those.\n\n79\n00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.780\nIncluding the answers and the rationale.\n\n80\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.480\nThere's the veritable goody\nbox of other things, too.\n\n81\n00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.480\nThere's instructions on how you can\njoin the ITSM community of forums.\n\n82\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.200\nSo you can come in, log in,\nget to the forum and\n\n83\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.170\nhave conversations with experts\nlike me and other instructors\n\n84\n00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.980\nas well as other candidates, the people\ntrying to get the certification.\n\n85\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.599\nSo you can post your questions and\nget good answers there.\n\n86\n00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.190\nThe course materials,\naffectedly the slide deck if you will,\n\n87\n00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.670\nit's not in powerpoint formats and\npdf format, but you get what I'm\n\n88\n00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.890\npresenting in paper form,\nthere's ways to get access to that.\n\n89\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.290\nInstructions for how to get there, and\nalso instructions for how to redeem\n\n90\n00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.890\ndiscounts for your actual exam, as well\nas to buy books, like if you want to buy\n\n91\n00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.315\nthe ITIL library books, those five core\npublications or some pocket manuals.\n\n92\n00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:25.295\nAnd things like that, so there's four\n\n93\n00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:32.505\ndeliverables that are associated with\nthe two exams and two answer sheets.\n\n94\n00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:36.465\nAnd then there is another download\nthat will give you instructions for\n\n95\n00:05:36.465 --> 00:05:40.495\nhow you can redeem those discounts for all\nthose resources including the

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:18.075\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n5\n00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:21.860\nand in today's episode we begin\nour series on ITIL Foundation.\n\n6\n00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.315\nAnd joining us in the studio to lend his\nexpertise on that topic is our friend and\n\n7\n00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:29.900\n[LAUGH] well, our colleague as well,\nour good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n8\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.120\nTerry, welcome to the show,\nsir, we're so glad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.840\nHow are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.040\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel, glad to\nbe here and we got a lot to learn so\n\n11\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.800\nlet's get started.\n\n12\n00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.049\nAs Daniel said, we're here for\nITIL Foundation.\n\n13\n00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:43.885\nThis first episode is on\nthe introduction topics and\n\n14\n00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:47.165\nwe're basically gonna try\nto prepare you for an exam.\n\n15\n00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:51.216\nThat's our primary objective over all of\nthese episodes is to get you ready to take\n\n16\n00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:52.516\nthe Foundation's exam.\n\n17\n00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:57.035\nThe advantage of taking it through ITProTV\nis that the fire hose that I am going to\n\n18\n00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:01.083\nbe throwing out here and you're\ndrinking from is controlled by you, so\n\n19\n00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:04.020\nyou kind of take it in\nthe doses that you need.\n\n20\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.020\nBut there is lots to learn, and again,\n\n21\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.290\nwe're just setting the table\nhere with the introduction.\n\n22\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.130\nWe're going to talk about\nthe overall framework of ITIL,\n\n23\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.770\nthe topics are broad and\ndetailed at the same time.\n\n24\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.450\nA lot of vocabulary,\na lot of words to learn and let's dive in.\n\n25\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.550\nMultiple episodes, as I mentioned, and\nthere'll be up to 13 episodes on and off\n\n26\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.870\nfor the ITIL Foundations, including some\npost episode quizzes and some self study.\n\n27\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.540\nSome of this you need to\ndo a little homework and\n\n28\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.940\nthen come to the episodes that's\nrelated to the practice exams.\n\n29\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.830\nThere's two practice exams associated\nwith this learning and that's\n\n30\n00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.460\nreally where you're going to reinforce\nall the things I've been teaching.\n\n31\n00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.450\nThis course is officially based on\nthe five core publications of ITIL.\n\n32\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.170\nAs you can see them listed here,\nstrategy, design,\n\n33\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.430\ntransition, operations and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n34\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.610\nThese five core books are the books\nfrom which all of the exam\n\n35\n00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.700\nquestions are coming from.\n\n36\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.510\nThe advantage of,\n\n37\n00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.060\nof course, taking a course is,\nyou don't have to read all five books.\n\n38\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.370\nYou can learn from me and\ntake it from there.\n\n39\n00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.460\n>> I prefer that method.\n\n40\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.301\n>> It's much better.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:19.631\n>> I wonder, Daniel,\n\n42\n00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:25.580\ncan you see from any commonality among\nthese graphics that these pictures have?\n\n43\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.726\n>> There seem to be some sort\nof star type pattern to them.\n\n44\n00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:29.911\n>> Yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:30.869\n>> [CROSSTALK] branching\nout with the graphic.\n\n46\n00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:34.117\n>> Yeah, some of them are definitely\nhave the star based piece to them,\n\n47\n00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:37.201\nexcept the ones kind of look like\npeas in the service transition.\n\n48\n00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:38.200\n>> Like blood in a vessel.\n\n49\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.530\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n50\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.650\nWhat they all are is organic.\n\n51\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.090\nThey're all organic symbols, and that's\nthe nature of the ITIL beast, if you will,\n\n52\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.210\nis that it does grow\nwithin the organization.\n\n53\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.655\nIt's a cultural thing, almost.\n\n54\n00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:54.790\nSo it's a framework that kind of\nguides the way to deliver IT services.\n\n55\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.160\nIt is meant to grow and you to grow with\nit, so that's kinda the little trivia.\n\n56\n00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.810\nThat's not on the exam, don't worry about\nthat, but just a note about the graphics.\n\n57\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.050\nWhat ITIL stands for,\nthis is a tough thing.\n\n58\n00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.161\nWhen I talk to someone on the street\nabout what do you do, and\n\n59\n00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:14.790\nI say I teach ITIL courses,\nand say what's ITIL?\n\n60\n00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.806\nAnd I say, well, it's IT infrastructure\nlibrary, said, you're a librarian.\n\n61\n00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:21.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I said yep, yep, not really.\n\n62\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.940\nSo while the name is not\nnecessarily that descriptive,\n\n63\n00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.570\nit is IT service management framework and\nITIL is the official brand.\n\n64\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.002\nAnd once upon a time,\nthe answer to the question, what is ITIL?\n\n65\n00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:37.680\nWell, it's simply a set of books and\ntruly it is, it's a set of books.\n\n66\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.330\nIt provides guidance, advice, and again,\n\n67\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.290\nestablishes a solid framework that\nprescribes certain things to do.\n\n68\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.250\nI should say, not prescribe,\nit defines certain things\n\n69\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.930\nthat can make you successful,\nbut doesn't prescribe them.\n\n70\n00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.650\nYou don't have to do them.\n\n71\n00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.508\nAdopt and adapt are the two\nwords associated with ITIL.\n\n72\n00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:02.750\nA little bit of history of it,\nit's owned now by AXELOS.\n\n73\n00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.750\nIt was formed actually out of the Office\nof Government Commerce in the UK,\n\n74\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.710\nso imagine the US Chamber of\nCommerce trying to help businesses.\n\n75\n00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.200\nWell, the Office of Government Commerce,\nagain in the UK,\n\n76\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.526\nventured out to define what's\nthe best way to deliver IT.\n\n77\n00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:23.560\nAnd they own that venture.\n\n78\n00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.935\nThey invited industry experts, academics,\nand various folks from the industry and\n\n79\n00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:35.791\ncame up and started writing books, and\nsaid, this is a good way to deliver IT.\n\n80\n00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:40.790\nAnd here's what common\nbest practices look like.\n\n81\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.805\nAnd eventually,\nit did become a best practice over time.\n\n82\n00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:47.340\nYou'll see some of the milestones here.\n\n83\n00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.730\nVersion 3 came out in 2007.\n\n84\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.550\nThey did an update to that version\nin 2011, but promised that they\n\n85\n00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.650\nwouldn't reversion ITIL as it went on so\nyou didn't have to recertify.\n\n86\n00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.420\n>> That is awesome.\n\n87\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.498\n>> Yeah,\ncuz you know some of those [CROSSTALK]\n\n88\n00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:01.035\n>> Again.\n\n89\n00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:02.570\n>> Yeah.\n>> I've done the IT certifications\n\n90\n00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.650\nthroughout my life, and they love to\nexpire them, and now there's new ones.\n\n91\n00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.240\nThe information really\nhasn't changed a whole lot,\n\n92\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.860\nand now you've got to pay another $400 or\nwhatever for an exam.\n\n93\n00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.830\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n94\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.920\nSo they promised not to reversion in that\nregard, but they do continue to update it.\n\n95\n00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.030\nSo there's some information.\n\n96\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.840\nThey added some four processes to\n2011 that kind of broadened it out.\n\n97\n00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.340\nSo it's not a dead book, it is organic,\nthis set of books, they're not dead.\n\n98\n00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.285\nThey continue to grow and adapt and\n\n99\n00:05:30.285 --> 00:05:34.848\nin fact they just launched a new course\nback in March called Agile Practitioner,\n\n100\n00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:39.294\nso that's actually adding to the\ncurriculum as well and certification pass.\n\n101\n00:05:39.294 --> 00:05:42.760\n>> Okay.\n\n102\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.260\n>> This is a busy graphic.\n\n103\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.030\nIt can help test takers focus on a few\nthings that might show up on an exam.\n\n104\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.410\nIt's really describing how a best\npractice comes into existence.\n\n105\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.280\nLet me try and make some sense out\nof these, I'll get my pointer here.\n\n106\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.030\nTo show out if you look on the side\nover here we have sources and\n\n107\n00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.860\nthen on the right here we have enablers.\n\n108\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.060\nAnd then you can see that they're\nkind of pushing things down through,\n\n109\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.790\nI call it the grist mill or the crucible.\n\n110\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.260\nEffectively what this is,\nis it sources of best practice are really\n\n111\n00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.620\nwhere ideas come from, standards could\nbe a place where ideas come from.\n\n112\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.500\nIndustry practice,\nyour own internal experience and how you\n\n113\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.480\ndo things in your own IT departments\ncould be a source of best practice.\n\n114\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.670\nSo again, back in the day when they\nwere trying to define this framework,\n\n115\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.170\nit wasn't a best practice yet.\n\n116\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.090\nThey were just writing books and\ncoming up with ideas, and they did.\n\n117\n00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.720\nThey got academics involved,\nthey had training and education.\n\n118\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.600\nThey had people from industry and did\na lot of interviews with lots of folks.\n\n119\n00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.730\nAnd the combination were those ideas where\nactually then utilized by people and\n\n120\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.630\nthat's really what the enablers are.\n\n121\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.740\nWith one exception,\nyou have technologies here,\n\n122\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.940\nall the rest of these enablers are people.\n\n123\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.280\nAnd certainly technology can help\nany implementation to automate,\n\n124\n00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.840\nto make things less error prone, etc.\n\n125\n00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.430\nBut I look at sources as\nwhere ideas come from.\n\n126\n00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.950\nEnablers is what people do with\nthose ideas, and then they just\n\n127\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.960\npush that down through this crucible,\nI call it, they use it in operations.\n\n128\n00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.710\nSo they take it back to their shops and\nthey say, well, this is what we've been\n\n129\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.770\ndoing, but this is an idea that we\nhadn't considered, it might help us out.\n\n130\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.995\nAnd they got lots of external\nfactors determining how fit this is.\n\n131\n00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:34.515\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So ITIL was basically trying to figure\n\n132\n00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:37.050\nout, all right,\nwhat are the people in the industry doing?\n\n133\n00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.720\nAnd what is succeeding,\nwhat's not succeeding?\n\n134\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.490\nLet's take all those things\nthat are succeeding and\n\n135\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.730\nwe'll make that a best practice,\nwrite that in some sort of framework so\n\n136\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.640\nother people can succeed\nas these folks have.\n\n137\n00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.250\n>> Exactly and that was done, it didn't\nhappen overnight, it was practiced.\n\n138\n00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.321\nIt was put through this grist mill.\n\n139\n00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:56.895\nIt goes through highly regulated\nenvironments, regulators,\n\n140\n00:07:56.895 --> 00:07:59.815\nit goes through highly\ncompetitive environments.\n\n141\n00:07:59.815 --> 00:08:03.561\nRight, so you could be an IT service\nprovider that sells your IT services,\n\n142\n00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:06.118\nor you could be an internal\nservice provider that is\n\n143\n00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:09.930\njust providing services to your own\ncompany, and it still applies to both.\n\n144\n00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.380\nSo they wanted to make sure it was\nuniversally applicable, as well.\n\n145\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.993\n>> Not just some anomaly that well they\njust happened to get lucky and it worked.\n\n146\n00:08:16.993 --> 00:08:17.730\n>> Exactly.\n\n147\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.440\n>> This we tried it, we tested it,\nit works mostly for everybody, so\n\n148\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.400\nthat's why it's a best practice per say.\n\n149\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.030\n>> Exactly, and\nit's been put through this test.\n\n150\n00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.600\n>> They stuck it through the grinder.\n\n151\n00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.280\n>> Exactly.\n\n152\n00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.140\nExactly, the grinder's another good word,\nyeah.\n\n153\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.540\nCrucible, grist mill, it's proven to work.\n\n154\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.410\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right,\n\n155\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:40.060\nacross various industry segments,\nsize, shape, scope, etc.\n\n156\n00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:45.450\nAgain, exam takers, what you might\nunderstand in trying to make sense of this\n\n157\n00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.520\nrather complex graphic, is that sources,\nif you were to get a question like what\n\n158\n00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.595\nare sources of best practice just\nthink about where ideas come from and\n\n159\n00:08:53.595 --> 00:08:55.645\nbe able to pick them out of\na multiple choice question.\n\n160\n00:08:55.645 --> 00:08:58.215\nAnd then you see on the enabler side,\nyou're really looking for\n\n161\n00:08:58.215 --> 00:09:03.215\npeople, employees, managers,\ncustomers, suppliers, advisers and\n\n162\n00:09:03.215 --> 00:09:05.900\nof course technology can\nhelp all this as well, okay.\n\n163\n00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.560\nAnd that's really what ITIL has done.\n\n164\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.360\nIt was good ideas, end up being practiced\nby people with certain goals in mind and\n\n165\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.870\nthey put that through\nthe grinder as Daniel said and\n\n166\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:22.600\nit's become a best practice which makes it\none of the most valuable aspects of it.\n\n167\n00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.210\nIn fact, it is the most widely\naccepted best practice for\n\n168\n00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.400\nIT service management in the world.\n\n169\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.250\n>> They did something right.\n\n170\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.960\n>> That's right.\n\n171\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.766\nWell, and it shows up in how\npopular it is in courses.\n\n172\n00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:37.160\nI mean here's ITProTV offering these,\ntraining companies all over the world do\n\n173\n00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.500\nit, companies are adopting them,\nvarious sizes of companies as well.\n\n174\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.000\nSo it's been proven to work overtime\nthrough various environments, right.\n\n175\n00:09:50.534 --> 00:09:52.418\nHere's a good testable moment,\n\n176\n00:09:52.418 --> 00:09:55.627\nwhat are the factors of ITIL\nthat make it so successful?\n\n177\n00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:59.670\nWell, the fact that it's a best practice\nmakes it successful because that\n\n178\n00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.710\nmeans lots of people are using it.\n\n179\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:06.830\nSo if you want to engage with\na supplier that also understands ITIL.\n\n180\n00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.540\nYou can have a conversation with them\nin ITIL terms that they understand.\n\n181\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.650\nIf you want to bring in a new employee and\nthey understand ITIL,\n\n182\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.770\nthen you also are able to bring them\non with common understanding as well.\n\n183\n00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.747\nSo it's also non-prescriptive,\nmeaning it doesn't tell\n\n184\n00:10:24.747 --> 00:10:29.740\nyou thou shalt do this,\nit's more guidance and framework.\n\n185\n00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.410\nAgain the two words are adopt and adapt.\n\n186\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.900\nAnd it's vendor neutral.\n\n187\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.554\nIt's not the way IBM did it or\nthe way HP did it.\n\n188\n00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:42.162\nOr you may remember some\nlicensed practices in the past,\n\n189\n00:10:42.162 --> 00:10:47.590\nlike a Total Quality Management, or other\nones that have come and gone, so to speak.\n\n190\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.870\nSo, it's vendor neutral.\n\n191\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.560\nNot tied to a particular tool set.\n\n192\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.660\nIt's not how the tool maker decided\nyou should do change management,\n\n193\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.450\nor incident management.\n\n194\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.480\nIt's the way that they defined\nit with that in mind, okay.\n\n195\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.410\nIt's another tool to use.\n\n196\n00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.500\nThe graphic's not necessarily showing\nthese all, but ITIL is meant to compliment\n\n197\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:19.400\nproject management disciplines, or\nmaturity models, or even standards.\n\n198\n00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.276\nIt compliments those.\n\n199\n00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:21.609\nIt doesn't replace those.\n\n200\n00:11:21.609 --> 00:11:23.038\nIt's not a development standard.\n\n201\n00:11:23.038 --> 00:11:26.510\nIt's not describing the software\ndevelopment life cycle.\n\n202\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.970\nBut it does work well with those\ntypes of disciplines, as well.\n\n203\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.920\nIt's another tool in the toolbox.\n\n204\n00:11:36.525 --> 00:11:38.206\nInteresting note here,\n\n205\n00:11:38.206 --> 00:11:43.385\nservice management professionals\naren't just technical people.\n\n206\n00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:46.145\nIT is full of technical people,\nand rightly so.\n\n207\n00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:48.980\nYou need good solid technology to work.\n\n208\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.890\nBut ITIL is also based on having\nsome good solid business skills,\n\n209\n00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:58.370\ninterpersonal skills, communication\nskills, being good at defining processes.\n\n210\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.150\nAnd I won't cast dispersion on an IT\nperson, I'm an IT person myself.\n\n211\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.760\nYou probably are, Daniel, an IT person?\n\n212\n00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.773\n>> [CROSSTALK] once or twice.\n>> Yeah, once or twice.\n\n213\n00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:06.320\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.590\nIt's not that IT folks don't\nunderstand these things,\n\n215\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.010\nit's just not all IT folks\nunderstand these things.\n\n216\n00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.470\nSo you need a balance of skill sets to\nbe able to successfully implement ITIL.\n\n217\n00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.870\nIt's even a bit of sales and\nmarketing, if you will.\n\n218\n00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:24.020\nI mean, presenting your IT organization\nto the business in a sales and marketing\n\n219\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:29.240\ntype manner is different than just\nbeing the mysterious cost center that.\n\n220\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.750\nWe're not sure what you do,\nIT, but you sure cost a lot.\n\n221\n00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.319\nThat kind of thing.\nSo sales and marketing is trying to\n\n222\n00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:38.570\nposition IT in relationship to\nthe business in a positive light.\n\n223\n00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.890\n>> We do to tend to like to keep things\na little, a bit of a mystique around it.\n\n224\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.540\nLike a Fog of War, if you will.\n\n225\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.040\n>> Exactly.\n\n226\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.290\n>> We're like, I don't know what they,\nbut I know if they're not there,\n\n227\n00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.470\nwe're out of business, so.\n\n228\n00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.990\n>> Right.\n\n229\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:56.070\nAnd IT doesn't typically involve itself\nin the day to day of the actual business.\n\n230\n00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.530\nHe's just like you just need\nservers up and running.\n\n231\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.480\nYou need to make sure the website is,\nsomeone can get to it.\n\n232\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.700\nAnd those things, I'll make sure that\nhappens and you run the business.\n\n233\n00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.150\nBut if I know what's happening, that's\nbasically what we're talking about, right?\n\n234\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.060\n>> Absolutely.\n\n235\n00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.190\n>> Is engraining the two\nthings back together.\n\n236\n00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.610\n>> Exactly, it's certainly still\ndelivering on those technical promises.\n\n237\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.840\nYou must, IT must deliver on\nthose technical promises.\n\n238\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.510\nBut it needs to do so\nwith a business focus.\n\n239\n00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.980\nAnd that's what ITIL is trying\nto position IT to do better,\n\n240\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.062\nis focus on that business\n>> Why does our website need to be\n\n241\n00:13:27.062 --> 00:13:28.450\naccessible 24/7?\n\n242\n00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.250\nWell, because we're an online store and\n\n243\n00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.570\nif people can't get to it then\nwe're not gonna make any money.\n\n244\n00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.250\nSo it's why are we doing this,\nnot just do it.\n\n245\n00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.350\n>> That's right.\n\n246\n00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.710\nAnd to understand that the business\nis not just static it's moving.\n\n247\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.000\nAnd as the business moves,\nIT needs to adjust.\n\n248\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.390\nSo what you got really good at servers and\nweb, right.\n\n249\n00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.720\nDo you now need to be better at\nunderstanding cloud computing?\n\n250\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.620\nDo you need to be better at\nunderstanding virtualization, I mean,\n\n251\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.710\nthose kind of things?\n\n252\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.825\nSo you need to evolve as the business\nis evolving, that type of thing.\n\n253\n00:13:56.825 --> 00:13:57.455\nOkay, good.\n\n254\n00:14:00.565 --> 00:14:03.073\nThe accreditation scheme\nAxilos is the owner,\n\n255\n00:14:03.073 --> 00:14:05.905\nthe official creditor at\nthe top of the pyramid here.\n\n256\n00:14:05.905 --> 00:14:09.710\nExam institutes such as People Cert and\nAccent are also involved.\n\n257\n00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.200\nAn accredited training organization\nsuch as PassionIT Group and\n\n258\n00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.080\naffiliates such as\nITProTV is an affiliate.\n\n259\n00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.089\nThrough this structure,\nofficial training can be delivered,\n\n260\n00:14:20.089 --> 00:14:22.908\nexams can be administered and\ncertifications can be published.\n\n261\n00:14:22.908 --> 00:14:27.900\nSo this is just the hierarchy of\ncontrol of the official accreditation.\n\n262\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.509\nAnd of course you are a candidate.\n\n263\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.410\nAnd you're here to get certified.\n\n264\n00:14:36.465 --> 00:14:41.730\nSo, among the many certifications\nyou can have, here's a big list.\n\n265\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.380\nWe are now starting here at ITIL\nfoundations, it provides a foundation and\n\n266\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.650\nbasic understanding of the ITIL framework.\n\n267\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:56.060\nIt does so by giving you a broad\nsurvey of all stages of the lifecycle.\n\n268\n00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.020\nYou see the service lifecycle here,\nthese five books.\n\n269\n00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.950\nService Strategy, Service Design,\n\n270\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:06.080\nService Transition, Service Operations,\nand Continual Service Improvement.\n\n271\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.710\nThose are the five core books.\n\n272\n00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.040\nThey also represent five separate courses.\n\n273\n00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.580\nSo you could take those courses\nindividually after foundations.\n\n274\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.700\nFoundations is a pre-requisite.\n\n275\n00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:22.280\nSome of the topics in those five\ncourses of service life cycle\n\n276\n00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:28.020\nare combined into more in depth\ntreatment in service capability.\n\n277\n00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.590\nSo, for instance, service offerings and\n\n278\n00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:34.280\nagreements takes some from service\nstrategy and service design.\n\n279\n00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.720\nSo it begs from and\n\n280\n00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.710\nborrows from both of those books\nto form a related set of topics.\n\n281\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.794\nAs with planning, protection, and\noptimization, operation support analysis,\n\n282\n00:15:44.794 --> 00:15:46.642\nand release control and validation.\n\n283\n00:15:46.642 --> 00:15:51.815\nYou can mix and match these courses\nas you wish and eventually,\n\n284\n00:15:51.815 --> 00:15:57.279\nonce you have a 17 credits,\nyou can then take the capstone course\n\n285\n00:15:57.279 --> 00:16:03.917\ncalled Managing Across the Lifecycle and\nsuccess With that particular course,\n\n286\n00:16:03.917 --> 00:16:09.890\nmanaging across the life cycle will\nlead to ITIL Expert certification.\n\n287\n00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.100\nThe exam itself,\nwhat you're marching toward,\n\n288\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.090\nis to be able to pass a 40 question test,\nmultiple choice test.\n\n289\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.130\n40 questions, answers A,\nB, C, and D, right?\n\n290\n00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:24.720\nPick the right one.\n\n291\n00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.160\nYou get 60 minutes for that, so\nthat's about, averages out to a minute and\n\n292\n00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.110\na half per question, so\nit's a pretty good clip, right?\n\n293\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.300\nYou need to know it, basically.\n\n294\n00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.160\nThere's some concepts you\nneed to bring to it, and\n\n295\n00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.830\nthere's just some rote memorization,\nright?\n\n296\n00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.060\nSo, memorization and conceptual\nawareness is what the goal is here.\n\n297\n00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.280\nNotice the bar is not super high.\n\n298\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:44.912\nIt's only 65%.\n\n299\n00:16:44.912 --> 00:16:47.740\nThat means you've gotta get\n26 out of 40 questions right?\n\n300\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.925\nSo, it's not a real high bar to pass,\nbut don't get cocky.\n\n301\n00:16:51.925 --> 00:16:53.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You need to have some,\n\n302\n00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.050\nsome humble confidence, I think,\nwould be the appropriate goal, all right?\n\n303\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.330\nThe exams are challenging.\n\n304\n00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.690\n>> No Christmas train.\n\n305\n00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.440\n>> No Christmas train?\n\n306\n00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.150\nNo that's right.\n\n307\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.990\nExactly.\nThat's right.\n\n308\n00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.050\nAll right.\nAnd again, it provides, and\n\n309\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.160\nhere's just a sample\nquestion as an example.\n\n310\n00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.207\nWhat are some of the reasons\nITIL is successful, right?\n\n311\n00:17:13.207 --> 00:17:16.256\nAnd notice that it's not just simply A,\nB, C and D.\n\n312\n00:17:16.256 --> 00:17:20.800\nThey give you 1, 2 and 3, and\nyou gotta pick the right combination.\n\n313\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.190\nSo that makes it little\nbit more challenging.\n\n314\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.570\nIt means you have to evaluate all\nthree things in this case, all right?\n\n315\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:26.829\nSometimes there might be four things.\n\n316\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.390\nSometimes its just simply A, B, C,\n\n317\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.220\nand D, too, and you can just, it's just\nknowledge, rote memorization, all right?\n\n318\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.245\nSo what is the answer to this one?\n\n319\n00:17:35.245 --> 00:17:37.940\nDaniel, remember from\nabout five slides ago?\n\n320\n00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.464\n>> I literally, can't see that.\n\n321\n00:17:39.464 --> 00:17:41.080\n[LAUGH]\n>> What are some reasons\n\n322\n00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.100\nITIL is successful?\n\n323\n00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.640\nIs it the best practice, is that\none of the reasons it's successful?\n\n324\n00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.870\n>> Right, it is not tied to one vendor.\n\n325\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.730\nSo it's vendor neutral.\n\n326\n00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.810\nAnd it describes how IT organizations\nneed to form their activities.\n\n327\n00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.050\n>> It would seem like the answer is B.\n\n328\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.030\n>> One and two only, or\nI mean, one and two, right,\n\n329\n00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.320\nbecause it doesn't include number three.\n\n330\n00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:00.830\n>> Correct.\n\n331\n00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.410\n>> Very good.\n\n332\n00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.030\n>> Right, I was paying attention.\n\n333\n00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:03.620\n>> Yeah, you were.\n\n334\n00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.780\nDing, ding, ding,\nyou see the bold text there.\n\n335\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.600\nAnd by the way, we'll have quizzes\nlike this at the end of each section.\n\n336\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.240\nSo we can kind of have\na little fun with those.\n\n337\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.120\nWe'll just time those out as part of the\nreinforcment for what we're learning here.\n\n338\n00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.455\nAll right.\n\n339\n00:18:17.455 --> 00:18:18.934\nAll right.\n\n340\n00:18:21.843 --> 00:18:24.500\nService lifecycle.\n\n341\n00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.380\nSo Daniel,\nI'm gonna pick on you a little bit.\n\n342\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.680\nWhat does lifecycle mean?\n\n343\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.290\n>> It means the cycle of life.\n\n344\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:30.976\n>> Pretty much.\n\n345\n00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:32.368\n>> The recursive definitions.\n\n346\n00:18:32.368 --> 00:18:32.910\n>> That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.731\n>> No, its just how\n\n348\n00:18:33.731 --> 00:18:37.962\nlong something is around, that we're going\nto continue to use it until maybe we adopt\n\n349\n00:18:37.962 --> 00:18:40.950\nsomething else, or\nit just becomes debunked.\n\n350\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.070\n>> Pretty much it.\n\n351\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.800\nAnd it starts from its inception\nthrough its retirement, and\n\n352\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.170\nall points in between, right?\n\n353\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.640\nSo what ITIL does is describe it for\n\n354\n00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.000\na very specific entity called a service,\nall right?\n\n355\n00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.170\nThe service lifecycle, all right?\n\n356\n00:18:55.170 --> 00:19:00.362\nAnd a service lifecycle is, as we'll\ndistinguish a little bit later on,\n\n357\n00:19:00.362 --> 00:19:05.280\ndiffers from an application lifecycle or\na solution lifecycle.\n\n358\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.605\nWhat's the lifecycle of a server?\n\n359\n00:19:06.605 --> 00:19:10.690\n>> The lifecycle of a server is\nprobably how long it's relevant or\n\n360\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.648\nusable in your environment.\n\n361\n00:19:12.648 --> 00:19:14.390\n>> True, all right?\n\n362\n00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.110\nSo you bought it,\nthat's part of life cycle.\n\n363\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.850\n>> That's the inception.\n\n364\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:17.968\n>> Configured it, right?\n\n365\n00:19:17.968 --> 00:19:20.004\nYou get it configured, you use it and\n\n366\n00:19:20.004 --> 00:19:24.170\neventually it either goes out of support\nor gets supplanted by something.\n\n367\n00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.430\n>> Or you outgrow the usefulness.\n\n368\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.950\n>> Yeah, its capacity.\n\n369\n00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.690\nExactly, so\nthat's the lifecycle of a server.\n\n370\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:34.619\nWell services have lifecycles, too and\nthat's what we need think of, right?\n\n371\n00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:37.248\nAnd that's just how ITIL is structured.\n\n372\n00:19:37.248 --> 00:19:40.983\nAnd they broke this lifecycle\ndown into five stages,\n\n373\n00:19:40.983 --> 00:19:43.896\nthe first stage being service strategy.\n\n374\n00:19:43.896 --> 00:19:49.290\nWhat services should we be offering,\nthat will help the business succeed?\n\n375\n00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.512\n>> CRT repair.\n\n376\n00:19:50.512 --> 00:19:51.670\nRight?\n[LAUGH]\n\n377\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.470\n>> Right, well it could be.\n\n378\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.560\n>> Not a lot of call for\nthat anymore, right?\n\n379\n00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.550\n>> Exactly, not a lot of call for\nthe service to repair CRTs.\n\n380\n00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.820\nExactly.\n\n381\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.080\nBut there might be a service for\nfinancial management,\n\n382\n00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.230\nthere might be a service for\nbusiness intelligence.\n\n383\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.930\nThere might be a service for\ndelivering servers,\n\n384\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.950\nmaking sure servers are racked and\nready, right?\n\n385\n00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.000\n>> Man, I'd pay for that.\n\n386\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.994\n>> Right?\n>> I tell you what.\n\n387\n00:20:12.994 --> 00:20:14.109\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n388\n00:20:14.109 --> 00:20:14.840\nGood point.\n\n389\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.600\nSo, service strategy is, again,\nthe lifecycle stage that's focusing on\n\n390\n00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.450\nwhat services should we be offering\nto whom and at what cost, right?\n\n391\n00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.050\nAnd then once you decide what\nyour services are gonna be,\n\n392\n00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.310\nyou need to design those services.\n\n393\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.200\nAnd then after the design,\nyou transition them, right?\n\n394\n00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.720\nSo that's the part of getting\nit from the paper world and\n\n395\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.835\nmaking it available for use, which is\nwhat happens in service operations.\n\n396\n00:20:40.835 --> 00:20:42.670\nIt's when the service can be used, right?\n\n397\n00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.330\nContinual service improvement.\n\n398\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.070\nIt's certainly called a lifecycle stage,\nand it's totally fair.\n\n399\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.580\nBut it's actually alive and\nwell in all of these stages.\n\n400\n00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.110\nSo, CSI, continual service improvement,\n\n401\n00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.870\nis a stage through which you improve\nyour existing services, right?\n\n402\n00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:03.770\nBut it also could include\nimproving your design processes.\n\n403\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:08.290\nIt could include improving your\nstrategy processes, etc., okay?\n\n404\n00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:13.260\nNotice that these lifecycle stages\ncorrespond to the five core books, right?\n\n405\n00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.120\nSo again, here's the ITIL folks,\nthe librarians, if you will.\n\n406\n00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.944\nThe ITIL librarians deciding how to divide\nand conquer all they want to share for\n\n407\n00:21:21.944 --> 00:21:25.832\nbest practice, and they made a good\ndecision here to divide it up\n\n408\n00:21:25.832 --> 00:21:29.147\ninto lifecycle stages\n>> I see what you did there.\n\n409\n00:21:29.147 --> 00:21:29.717\nYeah, they're smart.\n\n410\n00:21:29.717 --> 00:21:31.218\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n411\n00:21:31.218 --> 00:21:33.535\nThat's what they're trying to get done,\nokay?\n\n412\n00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:40.917\nSo what they've done in each one\nof these stages is also defined\n\n413\n00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:44.100\nthe processes within those\nstages that make sense.\n\n414\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.547\nNow, just because a stage\nhappens to be born, I'm sorry.\n\n415\n00:21:48.547 --> 00:21:52.868\nJust because a process happens to be born\nin a stage doesn't mean that's the only\n\n416\n00:21:52.868 --> 00:21:53.771\nplace it lives.\n\n417\n00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:54.740\nKeep that in mind.\n\n418\n00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.320\nThey're in these books.\n\n419\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.630\nRight, so the server strategy\nbook describes five processes,\n\n420\n00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.970\nas you can see them here.\n\n421\n00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.250\nService portfolio management,\nfinancial management,\n\n422\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.800\nbusiness relationship management\nare part of the foundations.\n\n423\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.880\nDemand management and\nstrategy management for\n\n424\n00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.090\nIT services are not included in\nthe foundation curriculum, so\n\n425\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.580\nthere's no test questions on\nthose particular processes.\n\n426\n00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:24.990\nMemorization of this particular slide is\nnot critical to your success on the exam,\n\n427\n00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.740\nbut it is also very helpful.\n\n428\n00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:33.350\nIf you understand what each stage has,\nwhich processes exist at which stage,\n\n429\n00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.354\nyou have an idea of what that\nstage is trying to get done.\n\n430\n00:22:37.354 --> 00:22:38.517\nOkay.\n\n431\n00:22:44.105 --> 00:22:49.660\nAll right, this is a great graphic for\nlots of reasons.\n\n432\n00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.584\nNotice that the center of this is ITIL,\nright?\n\n433\n00:22:52.584 --> 00:22:56.550\nAnd you've got service\nstrategy focusing around that.\n\n434\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.980\nI think a better graphic\nmight include the customer,\n\n435\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.280\nwhere you see the word ITIL there.\n\n436\n00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.580\nIf the customer was there, or the business\nwas there, that strategy should revolve\n\n437\n00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:10.750\naround the customer, and then all\nthe other stages revolve around strategy.\n\n438\n00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.980\nAnd then there's continual service\nimprovement providing leverage\n\n439\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.660\nagainst all of those, right?\n\n440\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.130\nMaking sure they're all\ndoing it very well, right?\n\n441\n00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.140\nSo sure, we're gonna talk about\nit kind of in a cascade fashion.\n\n442\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.640\nWe'll talk about strategy first.\n\n443\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.540\nIn a perfect world,\n\n444\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.970\nin a green field where you're just\nstarting, that's where you'd start.\n\n445\n00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.750\nWhat services do we wanna offer?\n\n446\n00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.830\nBut people adopt ITL in a non-green field.\n\n447\n00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.550\nIn other words,\nyou already got existing services, right?\n\n448\n00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:41.700\nSo the way you implement ITIL, well,\nwe're gonna talk about it in cascade.\n\n449\n00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.510\nThese processes and\nthese stages are actually integrated.\n\n450\n00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.520\nThey work together.\n\n451\n00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.608\nAnd CSI is a good point of leverage.\n\n452\n00:23:47.608 --> 00:23:51.348\nContinual service improvement is\na good point of leverage around that.\n\n453\n00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:52.288\nOkay.\n\n454\n00:23:56.718 --> 00:24:01.310\nSo transition to some definitions now and\nhere's one that's a key one.\n\n455\n00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.520\nWhat is a service?\n\n456\n00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.280\nThis is worth memorizing, test takers.\n\n457\n00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.918\nA means of delivering value to\ncustomers by facilitating outcomes they\n\n458\n00:24:09.918 --> 00:24:14.790\nwant to achieve without the ownership\nof specific cost and risks.\n\n459\n00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.916\nNotice that value and\ncustomers is in uppercase here.\n\n460\n00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:23.510\nITIL focuses so much on delivering value,\n\n461\n00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:28.510\nnot just solutions, but value and\ndelivering them to customers, so\n\n462\n00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:32.160\nmuch focus is on the customers,\nI call it the 9/10th rule.\n\n463\n00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.720\nNine times out of ten, if you face a test\nquestion, and one of the answers has\n\n464\n00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.330\nthe word value in it, and the other\nthree don't have the word value in it,\n\n465\n00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:45.580\nchances are the one with the value\nin it is gonna be the right answer.\n\n466\n00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.160\nAnd it holds true with our customers, too.\n\n467\n00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.790\nThat's just how much focus ITIL puts on\nthose two concepts, value and customer.\n\n468\n00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.700\nThe other word here, actually,\nis the word service,\n\n469\n00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.380\nyou see it's also in all uppercase here.\n\n470\n00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.150\nWhat is a service?\n\n471\n00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.810\nService versus solution,\nservice versus a system.\n\n472\n00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.780\nService is this all encompassing method or\n\n473\n00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.510\nmeans of delivering\nvalue to the customers.\n\n474\n00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.820\nThere's nothing really magical\nabout the word outcome here,\n\n475\n00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.430\nit's not a real crazy definition,\nyou see the definition there.\n\n476\n00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.540\nUnderstanding the definition of\noutcomes can also serve you on you exam\n\n477\n00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.120\nquestion as well.\n\n478\n00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:32.680\nService management, again, definition,\njust rote memorization time.\n\n479\n00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.130\nWhat is service management?\n\n480\n00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:38.200\nIt is a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities.\n\n481\n00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.360\nI equate the words,\nservice management with capabilities,\n\n482\n00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.040\nis my memory crutch there.\n\n483\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.120\nService management means you have\nthe ability to deliver services\n\n484\n00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.610\nwell is what that's trying to connote.\n\n485\n00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:01.090\nIT service management is this capability\nof delivering services using IT.\n\n486\n00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.130\nWe just kinda cascaded there.\n\n487\n00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.200\nWhat is a service?\n\n488\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.610\nQuite generically,\nit means delivering value to customers.\n\n489\n00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.060\nWhat is service management?\n\n490\n00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.220\nA capability to deliver a service.\n\n491\n00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.350\nIT service management is the ability\nto deliver service through IT.\n\n492\n00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.080\n>> It's pretty simple.\n\n493\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.670\n>> It is.\n>> I like the way that they\n\n494\n00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:23.520\nbasically are funneling you where exactly\nthey want you to know and what to think.\n\n495\n00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.050\n>> That's right, and simply,\n\n496\n00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.780\nthey just distill things into\nthese conceptual buckets.\n\n497\n00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.780\nLots of things we consider,\nthey just distill them down.\n\n498\n00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.100\nThree types of service providers.\n\n499\n00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:44.760\nPretty straight up here, Type I, Type II,\nType III, internal, shared, external.\n\n500\n00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.810\nAgain, trying to memorize these is\ndefinitely worth your trouble for an exam.\n\n501\n00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.570\nType I and Type II both happen\nto be internal providers.\n\n502\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:27:01.510\nAn internal service provider is an IT\norganization embedded with the business.\n\n503\n00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.870\nI'll give you an example of\na company I used to work for.\n\n504\n00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.700\nWe had different divisions, we had an R&D\ndivision, we had a manufacturing division,\n\n505\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.640\na sales division, a vaccines division,\nthose kinds of things.\n\n506\n00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.170\nThose separate business units each\nhad their own IT department, so those\n\n507\n00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.720\nwere internal service providers imbedded\nwith the business units themselves.\n\n508\n00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.990\nA shared services unit is also internal,\nbut\n\n509\n00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:28.750\nit had the central things that are used by\nall of the business unit, such as email,\n\n510\n00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:32.735\nthe Intranet portal, document management\nsystems, learning management systems.\n\n511\n00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:35.880\nThose things that are consumed\nby all the business units\n\n512\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.800\ninstead of those specialized services\nthat are within the business units.\n\n513\n00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.860\nSo internal, shared,\nthey both happen to be internal, but\n\n514\n00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.490\nshared is used by multiple business\nunits within the same organization.\n\n515\n00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.600\nAn external service provider\nis simply a provider that\n\n516\n00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.530\nprovides IT services to someone\noutside their organization.\n\n517\n00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.750\nPerhaps for profit, that sort of thing.\n\n518\n00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:02.880\nPerhaps they make money doing this,\nISPs, your cable TV provider\n\n519\n00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.470\nis effectively an IT provider and they're\nproviding services to external customers.\n\n520\n00:28:14.867 --> 00:28:16.685\nStakeholders and service management.\n\n521\n00:28:16.685 --> 00:28:21.360\n[COUGH] I like the fact that these\n\n522\n00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.180\nare three highlighting customers,\nusers and supplier.\n\n523\n00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.900\nThose are stakeholders and\nservice management.\n\n524\n00:28:28.965 --> 00:28:35.520\nApparently, there's a stakeholder here\nthat is missing we should take a note of.\n\n525\n00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.670\nIt's actually the service\nprovider themselves.\n\n526\n00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:43.110\nYou perhaps heard the phrase,\nthe cobbler's kids have no shoes?\n\n527\n00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.350\nLeaving out the service provider,\nyourself and\n\n528\n00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.150\nyour own employees within the IT\norganization, they're obviously\n\n529\n00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.780\nstakeholders in service management too and\nyou gotta tend to them as well.\n\n530\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.930\nSo there's actually four stakeholders,\ncustomers,\n\n531\n00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:02.797\nusers, suppliers, and\nthe IT service provider themselves.\n\n532\n00:29:02.797 --> 00:29:08.980\nWhat's the difference between\na customer and a user in this context?\n\n533\n00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.970\nCan they be the same?\n\n534\n00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.030\nSure.\n\n535\n00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.660\nBut why distinguish between those?\n\n536\n00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.520\nCan you give me an example perhaps,\nDaniel?\n\n537\n00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.470\n>> I was just assuming just off the top\nof my head that customers and users,\n\n538\n00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.150\ncustomers are obviously somebody\nthat's outside of your organization,\n\n539\n00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:25.210\nand a user might be someone\nthat's within your organization\n\n540\n00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.520\nthat works with your product as well.\n\n541\n00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.330\n>> Interesting, but not quite right.\n\n542\n00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.950\n>> Okay.\n\n543\n00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.264\n>> I see where you're going with it,\nbut not quite right.\n\n544\n00:29:33.264 --> 00:29:37.450\nSo take an internal service provider,\none that basically they provide IT for\n\n545\n00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.242\nthe same company.\n\n546\n00:29:38.242 --> 00:29:44.200\nThe customer would be\nthe one that paid for\n\n547\n00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:50.160\nand got the budget for this new let's say,\nlearning management system.\n\n548\n00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.590\nThat might be the HR department.\n\n549\n00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:56.890\nMaybe the HR department was the one\nthat negotiated with the CEO and\n\n550\n00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.850\nthe CIO, we need this kind of solution.\n\n551\n00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.310\nWe're gonna go to IT to get it, but\nwe need this kind of solution and\n\n552\n00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:08.480\nthey got the money to do it, and\nthen they effectively contract IT.\n\n553\n00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.590\nIt's not a contract, it's just\na relationship with their IT department.\n\n554\n00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:15.630\nWe want you to make\nan LMS available to us.\n\n555\n00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.809\nSo they're the customer and\nthey pay for it, and they sponsored it.\n\n556\n00:30:18.809 --> 00:30:21.330\nUsers is gonna be everyone in the company.\n\n557\n00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.953\nEveryone in the company was gonna\nuse the learning management system..\n\n558\n00:30:24.953 --> 00:30:29.287\nThe difference, the reason why they're\ndistinguishable here is because customers\n\n559\n00:30:29.287 --> 00:30:32.690\nand users could have\ndifferent stakes in the game.\n\n560\n00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:36.338\nA customer is looking at certainly\ncosts parameters and they're concerned\n\n561\n00:30:36.338 --> 00:30:40.760\nabout budget, project timing, when the\ngoing to be delivered, all these things.\n\n562\n00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.420\nUsers are waiting to consume it.\n\n563\n00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.309\nCustomers may want it cheap,\nfast and good.\n\n564\n00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.170\nUsers want it good,\nthey don't really care how much it costs.\n\n565\n00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.680\nIn some regards, they don't have\nthe same stakes in the game.\n\n566\n00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.800\n>> So a customer is not usually\nconsuming the product itself.\n\n567\n00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.290\nThey're just purchasing it for\nthe consumer to use.\n\n568\n00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.530\n>> Right, and they're not\nnecessarily mutually exclusive.\n\n569\n00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:08.100\nA customer may also be a user,\ncould be, but not necessarily, exactly.\n\n570\n00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.910\nRight.\n\n571\n00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.500\n>> So if the finance department,\nthe CFO of an organization says,\n\n572\n00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.620\nI need this kind of IT solution,\nhe gets it funded.\n\n573\n00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.350\nSure, he may never touch it.\n\n574\n00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.980\nHe may never actually use it, but\nthe financial analysts use it everyday.\n\n575\n00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.990\nSo they're not necessarily\nthe same kind of stakes.\n\n576\n00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.970\n>> I actually had that kind of\nsituation when I worked in insurance.\n\n577\n00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:32.860\nWe had CFOs, we had CIOs, and they said,\nyeah, we need this type of claim system.\n\n578\n00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.998\nWe bought this electronic claim system.\n\n579\n00:31:34.998 --> 00:31:38.510\nThey never used the thing, but our claims\ndepartment, they use it all the time.\n\n580\n00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.220\n>> Exactly.\n\n581\n00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.340\nSomeone sponsored it and paid for\n\n582\n00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.430\nit, that's the customer\nwho actually paid for it.\n\n583\n00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.040\nThen the users are the people\nwho get it done.\n\n584\n00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.109\n>> Makes sense.\n\n585\n00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.730\n>> That will do it for this episode.\n\n586\n00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.100\nWe'll pick back up on the next one.\n\n587\n00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.210\n>> Excellent, we really enjoyed\nour introduction into ITIL.\n\n588\n00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.990\nWhat it is, what we can expect when\nit comes to our exam a little bit.\n\n589\n00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.540\nWhat we can expect with what we are going\nto need to know, some key definitions and\n\n590\n00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.360\nthings of that nature.\n\n591\n00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.050\nWe appreciate that Terry, for\nyou explaining these things to us.\n\n592\n00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.140\nBut like you said, it looks like we have\ncome down to the end of this episode.\n\n593\n00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.750\nWe thank you guys for joining us.\n\n594\n00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:18.910\nHopefully, you have learned something.\n\n595\n00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.890\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou in the next one as well.\n\n596\n00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.950\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n597\n00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.670\nI'm Terry Decker, see you next time.\n\n598\n00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.642\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n599\n00:32:32.642 --> 00:32:35.360\n[SOUND]\n\n",

great episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.640\nin today's episode we continue on with\nstarting our series on ITIL Foundation.\n\n5\n00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.770\nJoining us back in the studio for\n\n6\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.600\nour part II on the introduction is\nour good friend Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n7\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.480\nTerry, welcome back sir,\nit's so good to have you.\n\n8\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.030\n>> Thanks Daniel, glad to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.660\nAnd let's dig right in.\n\n10\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.650\nYou'll recall from the first\nsection that we discussed\n\n11\n00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.820\ntypes of IT service providers,\nwe had internal, shared, and external.\n\n12\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.480\nSo we're gonna begin today\nwith types of IT services,\n\n13\n00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270\nas opposed to IT service providers.\n\n14\n00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.290\nSupporting services,\ninternal customer facing services, or\n\n15\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.710\nexternal customer facing services.\n\n16\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.870\nAgain, the three types\nhere of IT services,\n\n17\n00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.740\nas opposed to IT service providers, right.\n\n18\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.390\nA supporting service, it is basically,\nin the back end if you will,\n\n19\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.990\nthe back office services, server services,\ndatabase services, network services,\n\n20\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.090\nthe things that allow the front-end\ncustomer facing services to work.\n\n21\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.270\nSo, an internal customer\nfacing service could be email.\n\n22\n00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.160\nAnd underneath that are supporting\nservices like, servers,\n\n23\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.470\ndatabases, networks, right?\n\n24\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.730\nAnd then external customer facing\nservices are just those services that\n\n25\n00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.670\nare exposed to external customers.\n\n26\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.960\nAgain, probably for\nprofit but not necessarily.\n\n27\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.685\nConsider a bank for instance.\n\n28\n00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:43.501\nA bank has services,\nIT services for their employees,\n\n29\n00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:49.070\nteller software desktops\nas you go into the bank.\n\n30\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.100\nAnd then of course we use IT\nservice as customers in the bank.\n\n31\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.770\nEven though we don't pay for\nthose services directly.\n\n32\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.650\nWe use the ATM machines,\nwe perhaps use our phone,\n\n33\n00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.590\nthose IT services to access a bank.\n\n34\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.180\nSo, there's a service provider\nthat has supporting services,\n\n35\n00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.610\ninternal customer facing services and\nexternal customer facing services.\n\n36\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.400\nSo, you could be an IT organization\nthat is all three of these.\n\n37\n00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.420\nRight, so they're not mutually\nexclusive to one organization, right.\n\n38\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.950\nAnd I should add to this that\n\n39\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.130\nthese are distinctions in some\nregards without a difference.\n\n40\n00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.230\nRight, we can distinguish\nbetween a supporting service and\n\n41\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.500\ninternal customer facing and\nan external customer facing service.\n\n42\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.831\nWe can distinguish those.\n\n43\n00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:36.600\nBut as far as ITIL is concerned,\nyou still need to provide value, right?\n\n44\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.820\nIt's not just because someone is\npaying for it that you provide value.\n\n45\n00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.560\nYou provide value as a service provider,\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.410\nSo it's important to know these.\n\n47\n00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.450\nBut it's also just as important to\nunderstand that these are distinctions,\n\n48\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.400\nreally, without a difference, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.520\nAnother graphical representation of this,\nyou see external customers,\n\n50\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.550\nthis is an organization that\nhas some external customers.\n\n51\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.860\nSome of them supporting the business\nprocesses as you can see in this area.\n\n52\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.070\nAnd then other external customers\ndirectly interacting with IT,\n\n53\n00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.220\nwithout a business process in between.\n\n54\n00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.400\nSo imagine a brick and\nmortar book seller, right?\n\n55\n00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.540\nThat has external customers.\n\n56\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.380\nSo people walk into the store.\n\n57\n00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.770\nThere's IT supporting those points of\nsales systems and inventory systems.\n\n58\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.280\nAnd there's business processes that\nare affecting inventory management and\n\n59\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.290\nthose types of things.\n\n60\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.170\nRight, for that book seller\nthat's got brick and mortar.\n\n61\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.840\nBut then you can have external customers\ndirectly interfacing with IT systems and\n\n62\n00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.890\nIT services such as\nthrough their web portal.\n\n63\n00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.080\nThey don't go through some middleware,\nor I shouldn't say middleware,\n\n64\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.570\nmiddleman of business process,\nthey access the IT services directly.\n\n65\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.833\nSo, while we do distinguish\nbetween internal,\n\n66\n00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:54.297\nexternal, these lines get blurred\nquite easily, as you can see.\n\n67\n00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:56.650\nAnd again, as far as ITIL is concerned,\n\n68\n00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.666\nyou still must bring the same sort\nof discipline to providing value,\n\n69\n00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:05.590\nwhether you're internal, external,\nor some hybrid of them all.\n\n70\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.960\nOkay.\n\n71\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.819\nSome other ways to describe\nservices is core enabling and\n\n72\n00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.960\nenhancing services, right.\n\n73\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.760\nNot types of service providers but\ntypes of services.\n\n74\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.730\nAs an example, email is the service\nthat most organizations,\n\n75\n00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.350\nmost people are familiar with now.\n\n76\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.645\nRemember the time before email?\n\n77\n00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:30.690\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I do remember the time before email.\n\n78\n00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.300\nYes sir.\n\n79\n00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.730\n>> There was a time before email.\n\n80\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.450\n>> It did happen.\n\n81\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.190\n>> That's right.\n\n82\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.090\nAnd there was interoffice memos on paper.\n\n83\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.570\nThere's a physical inboxes and\noutboxes that people used, right?\n\n84\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.360\nSo that core servers providing email,\nis something\n\n85\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.659\nfairly ubiquitous now,\neveryone aware of that core service.\n\n86\n00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.160\nWhat about email on your phone,\nis that also a given?\n\n87\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.280\nIn some organizations, it's not.\n\n88\n00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.590\nYou need the mobile email\nis not necessarily you get,\n\n89\n00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.680\nthat would be called enhancing service.\n\n90\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.690\nI know in my experience,\nwhen we first got email,\n\n91\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.610\nwe didn't necessarily\nrule out mobile email.\n\n92\n00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.720\nThat was something only the sales\npeople got for instance, right?\n\n93\n00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.690\nSo that was an enhancing service,\nand only certain groups got it.\n\n94\n00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.750\nSo core is something that's\nused by everybody and\n\n95\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.520\nprovides of course services and\nenhancing services with those things that\n\n96\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.170\nmaybe a subset of the group of\nthe customers or the business uses.\n\n97\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.820\nAn enabling service is akin\nto a supporting service.\n\n98\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.430\nIt's a service that allows\nthose services to happen.\n\n99\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.120\nSo what do you need for\nemail service to work?\n\n100\n00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.450\n>> You need a server,\nyou need access to a network.\n\n101\n00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.690\n>> So you need identity management,\n\n102\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.420\nyou need network management,\nyou need servers, right.\n\n103\n00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.560\nAnd those types of things in the back are\nsupporting services, or enabling services.\n\n104\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.080\nThey let that happen.\n\n105\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.740\nAgain, in some regards, it's another\ndistinction without a difference.\n\n106\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.460\nYou still need to put focus on\ndelivering value to your customers.\n\n107\n00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.840\nIt's just that an enabling\nservice doesn't necessarily have\n\n108\n00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.900\nthe end user customer in mind.\n\n109\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.030\nMaybe they have the email service\nprovider in mind as a customer.\n\n110\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.510\nBut you still must provide\nvalue to your customers.\n\n111\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.480\nAll right, folks, more definitions.\n\n112\n00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.430\nI think I'll give you a little apology,\nperhaps.\n\n113\n00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.280\nA lot of preparing for this foundation\nexam is memorization of words.\n\n114\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.380\nAnd where the apology comes from is\nthat these are sometimes the words\n\n115\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.590\nare something we've used for a long time.\n\n116\n00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.710\nAnd ITIL has given them\nvery specific meaning.\n\n117\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.650\nIf you bring your definition\nof the word to the exam,\n\n118\n00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.730\nthere could an opportunity for\nfailure, right?\n\n119\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.830\nYou won't get the question right because\nyou're bringing your definition and\n\n120\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.360\nnot the good old ITIL definition.\n\n121\n00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.860\nSo pay attention to definitions here,\n\n122\n00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.700\nI don't expect you to\nmemorize these as I go.\n\n123\n00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.290\nBut you do need to focus back on these\ndefinitions as you do your self-study and\n\n124\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.630\nprepare for the exam, right.\n\n125\n00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.610\nAgain, nothing really magical\nabout this definition, a process,\n\n126\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.630\na structured set of activities designed\nto accomplish a specific objective.\n\n127\n00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.780\nIt takes one or more defined inputs,\nand turns them into defined outputs.\n\n128\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.250\nRight, fairly straightforward.\n\n129\n00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.570\nSo digging in a little bit\ndeeper to what a process has.\n\n130\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.895\nITIL further characterizes processes\nas having four attributes.\n\n131\n00:07:30.895 --> 00:07:35.975\nEvery process defined by ITIL\nhas these same four attributes.\n\n132\n00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:40.839\nIt has in response to a specific trigger.\n\n133\n00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:42.600\nNow something gets it started.\n\n134\n00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.360\nThat's the input, right.\n\n135\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.830\nIt has a specific output, right,\nthe process has an output.\n\n136\n00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.580\nIt has some sort of stakeholder\nbeing me as a customer,\n\n137\n00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.590\nit delivers that output to\na stakeholder or a customer, right.\n\n138\n00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.480\nA customer is just a type of stakeholder,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.325\nAnd it is measurable.\n\n140\n00:08:01.325 --> 00:08:07.605\nA process needs to be measurable, and the\nimplication there is that you measure it.\n\n141\n00:08:07.605 --> 00:08:10.860\nLater on, when we talk about continuous\nservice improvement, the foundation of\n\n142\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.860\nbeing able to improve services is to\nbe able to measure what's underneath\n\n143\n00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:21.730\nthat service, and a measurement process\nis one of those key aspects of that.\n\n144\n00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.560\nDefinitely worth memorizing these four\nattributes as you move forwards in your\n\n145\n00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.770\nstudies, specific inputs,\nspecific outputs, or results.\n\n146\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.580\nThey deliver those outputs to a specific\nstakeholder, a customer could be, and\n\n147\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.040\nmeasurable, again, worth memorizing here.\n\n148\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.080\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about measurement just a bit.\n\n149\n00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.670\nPerhaps you're familiar with a service\ndesk or a help desk, and they follow\n\n150\n00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:53.710\nprocesses to resolve when incidence occur,\nsuch as I can't find this,\n\n151\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.680\nI can't find that, the applications down,\nthe service desk is that call, and\n\n152\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.050\nfollows the process to get it back and\nget it restored.\n\n153\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.880\nHow would you measure\nthat kind of process?\n\n154\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.240\n>> I guess you would have to make\nreally clearly defined definitions for\n\n155\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.820\neach phases of the process.\n\n156\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.520\nAnd then they would be able to say, okay,\nI accomplished this phase of the process,\n\n157\n00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.750\nand be able to check that off.\n\n158\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.261\nRight, not only did you accomplish it.\n\n159\n00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:22.980\n>> Right.\nPerhaps the timescales of it.\n\n160\n00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.773\nHow quick they did it?\n\n161\n00:09:23.773 --> 00:09:26.886\nbecause we expect service desk to\nbe responsive and quick, right, so\n\n162\n00:09:26.886 --> 00:09:28.640\nperhaps you measure the time it takes.\n\n163\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.179\nSo, how long were you on hold?\n\n164\n00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:33.518\nDid you call, and\nwere you were on hold for three minutes?\n\n165\n00:09:33.518 --> 00:09:35.518\nThat can be something measured, right?\n\n166\n00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:39.370\nThat can be an element of measuring\njust how effective your service desk is.\n\n167\n00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.829\nHow long did it take them to\nrespond that they got your concern?\n\n168\n00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:45.970\nHow long did it take them to resolve it,\nright.\n\n169\n00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.570\nSo you could measure those things.\n\n170\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.080\nBut so, we're gonna be describing\nsome 22 processes this week, and\n\n171\n00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.300\nwe're not gonna dive deep\ninto their measurements.\n\n172\n00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.830\nBut understand that every process is\nintended to be measured, and that\n\n173\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.058\nmeasurement is showing you the quality of\nhow good that process is actually working.\n\n174\n00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:06.970\nOkay, all right, a process model,\n\n175\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:12.540\nthis word model is used a lot in ITO,\nand it effectively just describes\n\n176\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:19.050\nthe various parameters of succeeding\ngiven the particular process, right?\n\n177\n00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:24.560\nAnd to be able to succeed in your process\nmodel, you must be able to show control.\n\n178\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.005\nYou must define your processes themselves,\nright.\n\n179\n00:10:28.005 --> 00:10:29.970\nThat's the middle tier here.\n\n180\n00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.340\nAnd you must also enable people\nto know how to use that process,\n\n181\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.850\nyou have to have people, process enablers.\n\n182\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.850\nThese are the people that actually\nget it done, or the tool sets that\n\n183\n00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.900\nhelp you get those done,\nthe enables there, could be technology.\n\n184\n00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.320\nSo under process control,\nyou have things like process policy.\n\n185\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.450\nYou could have a very,\nvery good process that would really work,\n\n186\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.250\nwell if people only followed it, right.\n\n187\n00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.610\nSo if people aren't following it,\nit's obviously not working,\n\n188\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.730\nbecause people are choosing to go off\nthe reservation and do their own things.\n\n189\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.130\nSo no matter how good or bad the process\nis, if you don't have some sort of policy\n\n190\n00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.520\non top of it to say, we got to follow\nthis process, it's not going to happen.\n\n191\n00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.860\nRight, very well.\n\n192\n00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.680\nSo understanding process control is\neffectively understanding that there\n\n193\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.610\nis a hierarchy of why\nwe need this process,\n\n194\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.930\nhow we're going to control this process,\nwhat it's intended to do, its objectives.\n\n195\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.276\nAnd you're certainly getting\nit documented, right?\n\n196\n00:11:30.276 --> 00:11:34.541\nAnd then under process itself is\nyour metrics, your measurements,\n\n197\n00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:38.952\nhow you go about improving it,\nhow do you go about testing compliance,\n\n198\n00:11:38.952 --> 00:11:43.460\nour people actually following this,\nso you audit them or you go and see.\n\n199\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.250\nYou go and look and see, if people\nare actually following the process.\n\n200\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.694\nThat's what process is about, okay.\n\n201\n00:11:49.694 --> 00:11:55.040\nAll right, so we have process,\nstructure set of steps, instructions.\n\n202\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.290\nA function is a team or\ngroup of people and\n\n203\n00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:03.130\nthe tools and resources they use to\ncarry out one or more processes.\n\n204\n00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.104\nSo a process is a set of instructions.\n\n205\n00:12:06.104 --> 00:12:11.701\nA function is a set of people with\nspecial skills and tools, right?\n\n206\n00:12:11.701 --> 00:12:16.704\nITIL is really good at distilling\nthese definitions down, right,\n\n207\n00:12:16.704 --> 00:12:21.722\nand there's only four functions\ndescribed by ITIL, only four..\n\n208\n00:12:21.722 --> 00:12:25.884\nThere's 26 processes,\n22 are in scope of foundations, and\n\n209\n00:12:25.884 --> 00:12:29.410\nthere are four functions,\nand they show up here.\n\n210\n00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.060\nThese are the four functions.\n\n211\n00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.530\nWe'll talk about these in depth when\nwe talk about service operations later.\n\n212\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.750\nBut I find it interesting that these four\nfunctions or these special groups of\n\n213\n00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:43.160\npeople with they're special skills can\nbe distilled down in just the four.\n\n214\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.740\nThere's only four of them.\n\n215\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.220\nAgain, we'll get in the details\nof these a little bit later.\n\n216\n00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:54.130\nA process, a set of steps, a function,\na group of people with special skills and\n\n217\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.170\ntools, okay.\n\n218\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.730\nWhere that could play out academically, if\nyou get a question, for instance, there is\n\n219\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:05.500\na process who's primary purpose is to\nrestore service as quickly as possible.\n\n220\n00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.740\nIt's called instant management.\n\n221\n00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.430\nThere's a process that has that purpose.\n\n222\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.090\nThere is a function called service desk\n\n223\n00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.730\nthat Implements the instant\nmanagement process.\n\n224\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.890\nSo the service desk also has the purpose\n\n225\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.090\nof restoring service as\nquickly as possible, right?\n\n226\n00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.400\nThe process purpose restores\nservice as quickly as possible.\n\n227\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.590\nThe service desk, in using that process,\nalso has the same purpose, right?\n\n228\n00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.690\nBut here's where that\ncan show up on a test.\n\n229\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:38.250\nAs an example, which of the following\nprocesses is responsible for\n\n230\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.940\nrestoring services as quickly as possible.\n\n231\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.062\nYou might be tempted to pick service desk,\nbut it's not a process, it's a function.\n\n232\n00:13:46.062 --> 00:13:49.250\nSo, that's where knowing\nthe difference between a function and\n\n233\n00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.330\na process could serve you well on a test,\nand there's only four functions.\n\n234\n00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.450\nYou might not memorize all 26 processes,\nbut you can memorize four\n\n235\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.240\nfunctions probably, at least, keep you\nout of that little test trap if you will.\n\n236\n00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.976\n>> Couple of little flash cards to\nhelp out with that kinda thing, right?\n\n237\n00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:04.999\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly right, yep, good.\n\n238\n00:14:04.999 --> 00:14:08.014\nOkay, so we got processes,\nwe got functions, and\n\n239\n00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.991\nnow we're gonna discuss roles.\n\n240\n00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:14.639\nAnd, again, nothing really\nmagical about the word itself.\n\n241\n00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:17.200\nIt's a set of responsibilities\nassigned to a person.\n\n242\n00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.480\nI have this role.\n\n243\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.140\nThis is what I'm supposed\nto be doing in this role.\n\n244\n00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.170\nAll right.\n\n245\n00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.210\nIt's a generic definition of a role.\n\n246\n00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.400\nRight, we'll talk about some generic roles\nhere in a minute, like process owner,\n\n247\n00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:32.680\nprocess manager, etc, right, but role is\nsimply that set of responsibilities and\n\n248\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.090\nactivities granted to a specific person,\nright.\n\n249\n00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.740\nSo, if you're the incident\nmanagement process owner,\n\n250\n00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.240\nyou have a certain set of responsibilities\nthat the incident management process\n\n251\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.020\nowner is supposed to be taking care of,\nright, that sort of thing.\n\n252\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.480\nOr if you're an instant management\npractitioner, then you have\n\n253\n00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.730\nother roles that you're supposed\nto be responsible for, as example.\n\n254\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.360\nSo, are the roles the specific\nresponsibilities for\n\n255\n00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.530\nthe people that work inside of a function?\n\n256\n00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.360\n>> Yes.\n\n257\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.690\n>> Absolutely, very good.\n\n258\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.120\nExactly, indeed.\n\n259\n00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:13.078\nSo this term RACI matrix,\nthe actual exam is not a acronym test.\n\n260\n00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.389\n>> This is a family show, so\nlet's keep it clean [CROSSTALK]\n\n261\n00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:16.486\n>> Exactly, not very race [LAUGH].\n\n262\n00:15:16.486 --> 00:15:17.114\n>> Nothing racy.\n\n263\n00:15:17.114 --> 00:15:19.078\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah good point.\n\n264\n00:15:19.078 --> 00:15:23.682\nIn fact, I think, I've seen it described\notherwise as ARCI, A-R-C-I, but\n\n265\n00:15:23.682 --> 00:15:26.131\nRACI certainly sounds great here racier.\n\n266\n00:15:26.131 --> 00:15:27.140\n>> It does.\n>> And there we are.\n\n267\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.455\n>> So salacious.\n\n268\n00:15:28.455 --> 00:15:32.790\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n269\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.950\n>> Again,\nITL does not present you an acronym test.\n\n270\n00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.790\nThey're not gonna say what does BRM mean,\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n271\n00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:46.353\nYou may see those acronyms\noften on the slide deck.\n\n272\n00:15:46.353 --> 00:15:49.751\nThere's only three acronyms\nthat I've seen tested.\n\n273\n00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:51.236\nRACI is one of them.\n\n274\n00:15:51.236 --> 00:15:53.332\nYou need to know what\nthese four letters mean.\n\n275\n00:15:53.332 --> 00:15:53.896\nRight?\n\n276\n00:15:53.896 --> 00:15:57.130\nSo this happens to be an exception to\nthe rule, that it's not an acronym test,\n\n277\n00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.990\nthat's what I'm pointing out here.\n\n278\n00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.270\nAnd it's pretty easy to work out,\nResponsible, Accountable,\n\n279\n00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.320\nConsulted and Informed, right?\n\n280\n00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.650\nAnd the purpose of a RACI matrix is\nto be able to, as this graphic shows\n\n281\n00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:16.915\nis to be able to map roles\nto specific activities.\n\n282\n00:16:16.915 --> 00:16:21.410\nIn this example they've listed\nthe director service managements,\n\n283\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.300\nservice level manager these\nare the roles being played out.\n\n284\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.348\nRight?\nAnd underneath it you had Activity 1,\n\n285\n00:16:26.348 --> 00:16:27.920\nActivity 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.\n\n286\n00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:34.011\nSo in this Matrix you can see that\nthe Director Service Management is both\n\n287\n00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:37.079\naccountable and\nresponsible for Activity 1 and\n\n288\n00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:40.998\nthat the Service Level Manager\nis consulted for Activity 1.\n\n289\n00:16:40.998 --> 00:16:44.933\nProblem manger and security manager\ninformed for Activity 1 and\n\n290\n00:16:44.933 --> 00:16:48.570\nthe procurement manger is also consulted.\n\n291\n00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.020\nNow the value of this matrix, let's\ntalk about it at the high level first,\n\n292\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.580\nbefore we get into the details here.\n\n293\n00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.930\nThe value of this of having a RACI Matrix.\n\n294\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:04.180\nSo you can, in a single table be able to\nshow who was on point for what, right.\n\n295\n00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.570\nThe RACI, the letters themselves\ndescribe your level of involvement, or\n\n296\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.644\na person's level of\ninvolvement in that activity.\n\n297\n00:17:11.644 --> 00:17:12.890\nAll right.\n\n298\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.120\nSo let's describe what these mean.\n\n299\n00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.697\nAccountable means you\nmake sure it gets done.\n\n300\n00:17:19.697 --> 00:17:21.768\nYou don't do anything.\n\n301\n00:17:21.768 --> 00:17:23.800\nYou make sure it gets done.\n\n302\n00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.840\nResponsible is you do it,\nyou get that done.\n\n303\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.310\nSo in this particular case, the director\nof service management is both accountable\n\n304\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.470\nand responsible for Activity 1.\n\n305\n00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.940\nThey make sure it gets done and\nthey do it.\n\n306\n00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.040\n>> So you can be both.\n\n307\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.760\n>> You can be both.\n\n308\n00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.092\n>> It's not just a-\n>> Exactly.\n\n309\n00:17:39.092 --> 00:17:40.411\n>> Either or, it can be both and.\n\n310\n00:17:40.411 --> 00:17:46.590\n>> Exactly right, now because\nan accountable person doesn't do anything.\n\n311\n00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.240\n>> No, well they do do something, but\ntechnically, based off your definition,\n\n312\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.840\nno they don't.\n\n313\n00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.300\n>> They do not, and because a cannibal\nperson doesn't do anything, for\n\n314\n00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.580\nany given activity you have to\nhave at least one responsible.\n\n315\n00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.700\nOr else nothing will get done, right.\n\n316\n00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.380\nSo the rules, that's one of the rules.\n\n317\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.620\nYou have to have at least one R for\nany given activity.\n\n318\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.320\nAt least one R, or else it's not get done.\n\n319\n00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.180\n>> Right, that makes sense, right.\n\n320\n00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.130\n>> Now, the word accountable though,\n\n321\n00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.590\nmeans there's only one person\nthat make sure it's done.\n\n322\n00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.088\nBecause if you've more than one person\nthat's accountable, they can get lost,\n\n323\n00:18:21.088 --> 00:18:23.381\nI thought Jerry did that,\nor I thought Mary did that.\n\n324\n00:18:23.381 --> 00:18:25.436\n>> Too many [CROSSTALK]\n>> Exactly.\n\n325\n00:18:25.436 --> 00:18:26.068\n>> And the soup gets salty?\n\n326\n00:18:26.068 --> 00:18:27.290\n>> Exactly right.\n\n327\n00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.290\nOne accountable.\n\n328\n00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.030\nRight?\n\n329\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:29.900\nOnly one accountable.\n\n330\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.030\nSo there's the two rules for this.\n\n331\n00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.970\nOnly one accountable and at least one R.\n\n332\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.420\nOne responsible.\n\n333\n00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.370\nNow consulted and informed are subtle.\n\n334\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.040\nConsulted could either be a pull or\na push.\n\n335\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.490\nFor instance, for Activity 1,\nthe service level managed is consulted for\n\n336\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:47.900\nactivity one.\n\n337\n00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.780\nThat could be because, when the director\nof service management gets done with\n\n338\n00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:57.440\nthe responsibility, they're going to\npush it over to service level manager so\n\n339\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.180\nthat they can do Activity 2.\n\n340\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.990\nSo that can be the push consulting part.\n\n341\n00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:05.900\nIt also could be a pull, where the reason\nwhy the service level manager's\n\n342\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.090\nconsulted for Activity 1 is because\nthe director of service management\n\n343\n00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:14.410\nneeds some information from them\nbefore they can do activity one.\n\n344\n00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.640\nSo that's the pull of the consultant.\n\n345\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.420\nBut there is a level of involvement for a\nconsultant that's a bit more involved than\n\n346\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.940\ninformed, which is just kinda\nthe courtesy copy on an email.\n\n347\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.780\nRight?\n\n348\n00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.730\nWe'll let you know.\n\n349\n00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.430\nI don't need information from you.\n\n350\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.160\nYou don't need to do anything with\nthe information I'm giving you, but\n\n351\n00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.890\nyou just wanna know.\n\n352\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.760\nSo that's what that is.\n\n353\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.087\nFair enough?\n\n354\n00:19:35.087 --> 00:19:37.660\n>> Fair enough.\n>> All right, the RACI matrix.\n\n355\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.175\nKnow what it is, know what the letters\nstand for, and know the rules.\n\n356\n00:19:41.175 --> 00:19:43.015\nOnly one A and at least one R.\n\n357\n00:19:45.565 --> 00:19:46.545\nPretty straight forward there.\n\n358\n00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:51.645\nPointing to this one more than one person\naccountable, you get no one responsible.\n\n359\n00:19:51.645 --> 00:19:54.765\nI remember in learning CPR,\nif you come and\n\n360\n00:19:54.765 --> 00:19:58.632\nadminister CPR, you don't just,\nyou yell out someone call 911.\n\n361\n00:19:58.632 --> 00:19:59.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n362\n00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.381\n>> Yeah.\n>> You point to someone and\n\n363\n00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:04.553\nsay you, call 911 to make sure\nthat it's gonna get done.\n\n364\n00:20:04.553 --> 00:20:06.340\n>> Quite right.\n>> So that's accountable in that case,\n\n365\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.640\nit's also responsible.\n\n366\n00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.450\n>> Right.\nYou call it.\n\n367\n00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.270\nAll right.\n\n368\n00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.910\n>> The matrix could also show you,\nif I just go back one,\n\n369\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.990\nit could also show you where\nthe distribution of effort.\n\n370\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.570\nYou might look at this an easy way, and\neasily determine, maybe the problem here\n\n371\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.690\nis that it's got too many R's next to\ntheir name, or that sort of thing.\n\n372\n00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.970\nAnd it's also completely transparent.\n\n373\n00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.380\nIf you come up with a RACI matrix and\nyou share it with people,\n\n374\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.810\nthen there is no hiding,\nI didn't know I was responsible for that.\n\n375\n00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:37.480\n>> Right.\n\n376\n00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.630\n>> Because well yeah, you should have\nknown, because we published this RACI.\n\n377\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.180\n>> You know that email you got that had\nthe RACI chart on it with your name with\n\n378\n00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.238\nthe R next to it?\n\n379\n00:20:45.238 --> 00:20:45.790\nYeah.\n>> Exactly.\n\n380\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.710\n>> No getting away with this.\n\n381\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.390\n>> Exactly.\n\n382\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.370\nSo it's transparent.\n\n383\n00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:53.040\nIt's a way to manage the expectations\nof deliverables, etc.\n\n384\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.311\nSo a very powerful tool.\n\n385\n00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:55.750\nAll right.\n\n386\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.560\nSo now some generic roles,\na process owner.\n\n387\n00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:04.880\nA process owner is accountable to insure\nthat the process is performed according to\n\n388\n00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.990\nagreed and documented process and meets\nthe aims of the process as it's defined.\n\n389\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.500\nEffectively, what a process owner does\n\n390\n00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.510\nis make sure that the process\nis operated at a high quality.\n\n391\n00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.856\nRight, and to do that,\nit has to be documented,\n\n392\n00:21:19.856 --> 00:21:23.260\nit has to be audited pretty instantly,\nit has to be measured, right.\n\n393\n00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.580\nSo the process owner is accountable for\nthose things.\n\n394\n00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:31.741\nWhereas a process manager is managing\nthe day to day execution of the process,\n\n395\n00:21:31.741 --> 00:21:37.060\nmanaging on a day to day basis,\nas opposed to a process practitioner\n\n396\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.375\nwho's executing steps within that process,\nright.\n\n397\n00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:45.230\nA process practitioner is a little bit\ncloser to the ground getting things done.\n\n398\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:50.230\nGoing back a little bit, a process manager\nis managing the execution of the process.\n\n399\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.540\nThe process owner has defined the process.\n\n400\n00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.360\nIt's measuring the process, and\nit's ensuring it's up to speed.\n\n401\n00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.708\n>> Now, this flies in the face of all the\nmanagers I've had, because they love to\n\n402\n00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:01.937\ncome sit right over my desk and tell me\nexactly how I should be doing things.\n\n403\n00:22:01.937 --> 00:22:04.028\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I believe they call that micromanaging.\n\n404\n00:22:04.028 --> 00:22:05.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It could be, yeah.\n\n405\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.280\n>> That's actually a good point,\nDaniel, because a process owner and\n\n406\n00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.900\na process manager could be\nthe same person, right.\n\n407\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.110\nThis is not an organizational chart.\n\n408\n00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:17.546\nA process owner could also\nbe a process manager.\n\n409\n00:22:17.546 --> 00:22:21.357\nIt doesn't have to be good.\n\n410\n00:22:21.357 --> 00:22:25.690\nSo again, process owner accountable for\nthe quality of the process.\n\n411\n00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.010\nA process manager manages\nthe day to day execution.\n\n412\n00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.180\nAnd a process practitioner\nis executing the steps with.\n\n413\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.530\nIt's also, not only is it\nnot an organizational chart,\n\n414\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.420\nit is not even hierarchic.\n\n415\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.640\nIt's possible for a process\npractitioner to outrank a manager,\n\n416\n00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.440\nit's possible, right.\n\n417\n00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.080\nOr a manager could outrank the process\nowner, it's also possible there.\n\n418\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.890\nIt's not an organizational\nchart in any way,\n\n419\n00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.250\nthese are roles that must be played out,\nall right.\n\n420\n00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.880\nAnother very important\nrole is the service owner.\n\n421\n00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.160\nThe service owner becomes\nthe primary contact,\n\n422\n00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.700\nthe face of the service, if you will.\n\n423\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.280\nHe's accountable for the delivery of\nthe IT service including the initiation,\n\n424\n00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.470\nongoing transition and\noperations of that service.\n\n425\n00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:15.563\nSo, the service owner again becomes\nthe face of the service to the customers,\n\n426\n00:23:15.563 --> 00:23:18.355\nmake sure that service is of high quality.\n\n427\n00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:21.340\nAnd that includes understanding\nwhat processes underpin it,\n\n428\n00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.825\nwhat technology underpins it,\nnot at a deep level, but at a macro level,\n\n429\n00:23:24.825 --> 00:23:28.675\nif you will, to make sure that service is\ndelivering that right kind of quality.\n\n430\n00:23:28.675 --> 00:23:30.260\n>> The 30,000 foot view.\n\n431\n00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:30.890\n>> Yes, right.\n\n432\n00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.890\nGood, any questions on roles or\nanything, anybody?\n\n433\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.703\nLet's go a little quiz then,\nsee how we do with this.\n\n434\n00:23:41.703 --> 00:23:44.902\nWhat is the best net definition for\nservice management?\n\n435\n00:23:44.902 --> 00:23:46.331\nDaniel, you wanna try any of these?\n\n436\n00:23:46.331 --> 00:23:48.064\n>> Aw man, I'm horrible at tests.\n\n437\n00:23:48.064 --> 00:23:49.888\nYeah.\n\n438\n00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:51.169\nLet's see here.\n\n439\n00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:54.960\nWhat is the best definition,\nI am horrible at tests.\n\n440\n00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.881\nYou shouldn't ask me test questions.\n\n441\n00:23:57.881 --> 00:23:59.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's fine.\n\n442\n00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.020\nWe'll just go ahead,\ngive the students a chance here.\n\n443\n00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.350\nAn organization working together\nto deliver services for customers.\n\n444\n00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.100\nThere's a word I'd like to add\nto this that's almost common\n\n445\n00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.600\nto all the definitions of service\nmanagement is a capability.\n\n446\n00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.140\nIt's an organizational\ncapability that allows for\n\n447\n00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.470\npeople to work together to\ndeliver service for customers.\n\n448\n00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.318\nIt's a capability.\n\n449\n00:24:17.318 --> 00:24:20.050\nThat's good.\n\n450\n00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.720\nFunctions are best described as,\nDaniel, know the trans?\n\n451\n00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.435\n>> Is it hot in here, or is just me?\n\n452\n00:24:25.435 --> 00:24:26.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It feels hot.\n\n453\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.860\nIt's really warm.\n\n454\n00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.070\nFunctions, I think I\ngive this one a see here.\n\n455\n00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:36.565\nLook, lacking their own body knowledge,\nclosed loop systems,\n\n456\n00:24:36.565 --> 00:24:42.820\nself-contained units of organization,\nfocused only on IT Operation activities.\n\n457\n00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.820\nFunctions, I'm trying to\nremember what functions were.\n\n458\n00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.660\nWe talked about that.\n\n459\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.170\n>> It's a group of people\nwith special skills and\n\n460\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.420\ntools and\nITIL divided them up into four chunks.\n\n461\n00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.460\nThat would be those self-contained\nunits of an organization.\n\n462\n00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.760\nOperating definition of a function is\na group of people with special skills and\n\n463\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.890\ntools and ITIL describes four of them.\n\n464\n00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.640\nSo that's a self-contained piece.\n\n465\n00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.050\nConsider the following statements.\n\n466\n00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.392\nTrue.\n>> [LAUGH] A very good answer.\n\n467\n00:25:14.392 --> 00:25:16.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You have to consider.\n\n468\n00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.390\nA process should be traceable\nto a specific trigger.\n\n469\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.370\nAnd characteristics of a process\nare that it is performance driven and\n\n470\n00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.240\nable to be measured.\n\n471\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.989\nWhich of those two are correct?\n\n472\n00:25:31.468 --> 00:25:32.110\n>> You got me.\n\n473\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.160\n>> It's B, both of the above.\n\n474\n00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:33.800\n>> Both of the above.\n\n475\n00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.970\nThere were four characteristics\nof a process, you may recall.\n\n476\n00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.710\nIt's measurable, that's one of them\nhere and it responds to a trigger.\n\n477\n00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.030\nSo that's these two.\n\n478\n00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:46.970\nIt delivers an output, and delivers that\noutput to a particular stakeholder or\n\n479\n00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.150\ncustomer.\n\n480\n00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.620\nThat's why we do the review,\nand by the way,\n\n481\n00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.000\nyou'll have ample time to do some review.\n\n482\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.450\nThere's some sample papers\nthat you could download and\n\n483\n00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.230\nthose will help you reinforce these,\nas well.\n\n484\n00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.210\nWhat is the RACI model used for?\n\n485\n00:26:04.975 --> 00:26:05.740\nDaniel, you wanna try again?\n\n486\n00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.280\n>> I'm having a real hard time seeing\nthe screen to be honest with you,\n\n487\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.340\nwhich is why it's very difficult.\n\n488\n00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.810\n>> That's fair enough.\n\n489\n00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.140\n>> We got a monitor over my camera.\n\n490\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.140\n>> I see, it is kind of small.\n\n491\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.510\n>> It's about 12 feet away from me.\n\n492\n00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.060\n>> I get it.\nIt is kind of small.\n\n493\n00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.710\nSo small print.\n\n494\n00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.600\nThe RACI model is used for\ndocumenting the roles and\n\n495\n00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.830\nrelationships of stakeholders\nin a process or activity.\n\n496\n00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:30.590\nStraight up there, again,\nworth memorizing these types of things and\n\n497\n00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.540\nknowing what RACI stands for.\n\n498\n00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.140\nYou want to try that one?\n\n499\n00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.050\nWhat is RACI?\n\n500\n00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.323\n>> Responsibility, accountability,\nconsulting and information.\n\n501\n00:26:39.323 --> 00:26:43.880\n>> Yeah, very responsible,\naccountable, consulted, informed.\n\n502\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.380\nGood job.\n\n503\n00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.480\nWhich of the following is not\na valid service provider type\n\n504\n00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.150\nas defined in the ITIL framework?\n\n505\n00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.780\nSo types of service providers.\n\n506\n00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.929\nInternal, is that one?\n\n507\n00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.230\nYep.\nShared services, yep.\n\n508\n00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.520\nExternal service, yep.\n\n509\n00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.160\nCommercial service provider, no such thing\ndefined as commercial service provider.\n\n510\n00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.380\nSo D is correct because it's incorrect.\n\n511\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.760\nWhich of the following is not valid?\n\n512\n00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.560\n>> Those stinking not statements.\n\n513\n00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.670\nThey love to grab you, don't they?\n\n514\n00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.055\n>> Yeah.\nA service owner is responsible for\n\n515\n00:27:16.055 --> 00:27:17.695\nwhich of the following?\n\n516\n00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.585\nContinual improvement of a service.\n\n517\n00:27:22.756 --> 00:27:24.040\nThat sounds pretty good.\n\n518\n00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.890\nDesigning and documenting it.\n\n519\n00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.460\nNo, they don't get their hands that dirty.\n\n520\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.630\nCarrying out\nthe Service Operations activities.\n\n521\n00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.950\nNo, they don't carry out activities.\n\n522\n00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.340\nThey don't get down to weeds of things.\n\n523\n00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.040\nProducing a balanced scorecard.\n\n524\n00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.970\nAgain, they don't get down in the weeds.\n\n525\n00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.467\nSo, A is the correct answer,\ncontinual improvement of a service.\n\n526\n00:27:43.868 --> 00:27:47.079\nWhich is the best definition for\na service?\n\n527\n00:27:51.952 --> 00:27:56.240\nA means to deliver products, nope.\n\n528\n00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.310\nA means to deliver value, yes,\nby facilitating outcomes.\n\n529\n00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.450\nThe rest of that definition, by the way,\n\n530\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:09.020\nis a means to deliver value by\nfacilitating outcomes a customer\n\n531\n00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.610\nwants to achieve without\nownership of cost and risk.\n\n532\n00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:14.305\nMemorize that one.\n\n533\n00:28:14.305 --> 00:28:19.856\n[SOUND] Which of the following statements\nwould you say is most accurate?\n\n534\n00:28:19.856 --> 00:28:25.080\nCSI, Continuous Service Improvement, is\nevident across all stages of life cycle?\n\n535\n00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.850\nThat sounds pretty accurate.\n\n536\n00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:33.270\nService strategy is major input stays\nservice transition, not directly.\n\n537\n00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:37.810\nService operation is only concerned\nwith proactive processes, nope.\n\n538\n00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.900\nService design is not considered\ndesign of processes, only services.\n\n539\n00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.570\nAlso, not true.\n\n540\n00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.948\nA is the correct answer.\n\n541\n00:28:49.005 --> 00:28:52.140\nWhat are some of the sources\nof best practice?\n\n542\n00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.670\nThis goes back to episode one.\n\n543\n00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.090\nWe had the graphic where we had\nthe sources along the left,\n\n544\n00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.980\nthe enablers on the right.\n\n545\n00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.450\nThe sources were where ideas came from.\n\n546\n00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:04.700\n>> The meat grinder.\n\n547\n00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.610\n>> Yeah, that was the meat grinder slide,\nthat's right.\n\n548\n00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.140\nThe meat grinder slide.\n\n549\n00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.400\nSources where ideas came from,\nemployees took those ideas and\n\n550\n00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.310\nput them through the grinder, yep.\n\n551\n00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.600\nC is the correct answer, where sources\ncome from, sources of best practice.\n\n552\n00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:24.470\nAnd that concludes Part two\nof the Introduction to ITILl.\n\n553\n00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.090\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n554\n00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.820\n>> Yep.\n>> This is actually really cool\n\n555\n00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.450\ninformation.\n\n556\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.640\nI didn't know what to\nexpect coming in here.\n\n557\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.940\nI knew what ITIL was, and\n\n558\n00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.435\nnow that I'm learning more about what ITIL\ndoes, it's making a whole lot more sense.\n\n559\n00:29:35.435 --> 00:29:38.210\nAs somebody who has worked in IT and\n\n560\n00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.190\nhas seen all the things that\nyou've been talking about,\n\n561\n00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:46.200\nthis is really helpful information for\nanybody in IT or IT management.\n\n562\n00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.570\nBecause it helps us focus what we're\ndoing towards a goal instead of just, o,\n\n563\n00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:56.990\nyou need a server, here you go and my job\nis done and never mind anything else.\n\n564\n00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.260\nIt's why do I need that server?\n\n565\n00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.600\nNow I got a purpose behind that.\n\n566\n00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.024\n>> Exactly.\n>> And it starts to makes sense and\n\n567\n00:30:02.024 --> 00:30:04.500\nwe have a business model to follow,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n568\n00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.100\nTerry, we thank you for joining us today.\n\n569\n00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.960\nGreat, great explanations.\n\n570\n00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.212\nEven though I bombed the test.\n\n571\n00:30:09.212 --> 00:30:11.125\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm a horrible test subject.\n\n572\n00:30:11.125 --> 00:30:14.410\nYou can't judge him on\nmy poor performance.\n\n573\n00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.380\nThat being said, we do thank you for\nstopping by, we thank you guys for\n\n574\n00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.690\nwatching, but it's time for\nus to sign off.\n\n575\n00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.368\nFor ITPRO TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n576\n00:30:22.368 --> 00:30:25.219\n>> And I'm

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.860\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.360\nwell we're continuing on with more\non our ITIL Foundation series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.350\nJoining us back in our studio to\nlend his expertise on that topic,\n\n6\n00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.750\nour good friend Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n7\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.300\nTerry, welcome back sir, how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.350\n>> It's going good, I'm glad to be\nback and glad to see you again.\n\n9\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.030\nYou'll recall from our first couple\nof episodes we were dealing with some\n\n10\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.280\nintroductory topics for ITIL.\n\n11\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.580\nNow we're gonna start the multiple\nepisodes on each of the lifecycle stages,\n\n12\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.550\nbeginning with service strategy.\n\n13\n00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.900\nHere's a few of the topics we'll be\ntalking about in service strategy,\n\n14\n00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.760\nthis is an overview.\n\n15\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420\nAs we go and teach lifecycle stage it\nis structured this way every time.\n\n16\n00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.140\nWhere we talk about the entire stage,\nscope and purpose and\n\n17\n00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.160\nthen we get into some words, basics.\n\n18\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.110\nSome good key concepts and vocabulary and\nthen we talk about some processes.\n\n19\n00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.680\nIn this case there is three\nprocesses that serve as strategy.\n\n20\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.350\nService portfolio management,\nfinancial management for\n\n21\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.510\nIT services and\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n22\n00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.330\nSo that's where we're heading.\n\n23\n00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.020\nService strategy as a whole\nis really trying to define\n\n24\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.300\nthe overall effectiveness and\nquality of the IT service provider.\n\n25\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.080\nAnd you'll see a lot of P's here,\nperspective, positions, plans, and\n\n26\n00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.720\npatterns, these are all basically self\nassessment of the IT provider itself.\n\n27\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.410\nI can kinda characterize this\nas perhaps on the continuum,\n\n28\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.770\nyou could be an IT service\nprovider that's on,\n\n29\n00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.700\nI call it the bad end of the continuum,\nwhere you are a mysterious call center.\n\n30\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.340\nWhere the customer describes you as,\nwe're not sure what you do but\n\n31\n00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.800\nyou sure cost a lot.\n\n32\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.810\nAnd therefore you're big value seems\nto be focused on cost reduction, and\n\n33\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.130\nalways trying to save the money and\nyour competition is really budgets and\n\n34\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.970\nbeing competitive at a cost level.\n\n35\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.830\nOn the other end of the spectrum however\nthe better end of the continuum, if you\n\n36\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.230\nwill, would be a service provider that is\na strategic asset for the organization.\n\n37\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.170\nAnd without a good IT service provider,\nour business would not be as\n\n38\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.260\nsuccessful and we view you, and\nwe view IT as a strategic asset, right?\n\n39\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.310\nSo that's really kinda dealing with\nyour position along the continuum,\n\n40\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.230\njust where are you and\nwhere do you wanna be.\n\n41\n00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.140\nAnd if you find yourself on kinda on the\nband end where you're simply just chasing\n\n42\n00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.570\nbudgets and not really able to\narticulate how you're adding value.\n\n43\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.470\nThen you need to be moving toward this\nother in the continua where you're\n\n44\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.220\nadding value and you can articulate\nthat value to the business\n\n45\n00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.630\nmore effectively that's what\nthis deals with, all right.\n\n46\n00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.790\nSo you're obviously dealing with the\ncompeting interest of the business is here\n\n47\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.694\nyou know like I competing interest.\n\n48\n00:02:51.694 --> 00:02:56.754\nBut trying to merge those interest if you\nwill where the CEO of the organization\n\n49\n00:02:56.754 --> 00:03:01.890\nis trying to get things done and\nthe CIO is trying to match up with those.\n\n50\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.940\nAnd the level of communications between\nand betwixt, if you will, these\n\n51\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.000\nvarious layers of the organization is also\nkey to the success of a service provider.\n\n52\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.890\nAnd as the communications from the CEO and\n\n53\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.660\nCIO are articulated that needs to\nbe articulated downstream as well.\n\n54\n00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.328\nSo service strategy is really\na whole lot about making sure these\n\n55\n00:03:26.328 --> 00:03:31.169\nconversations at the very top of\na service are making their way into\n\n56\n00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:36.286\nsymbiotic relationship across\nthe organization within IT, right?\n\n57\n00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:43.237\nSo the scope of service strategy\npretty states, define the strategy for\n\n58\n00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:47.782\nthe service provider to make sure\nthe right services are being offered,\n\n59\n00:03:47.782 --> 00:03:50.635\nto deliver the right\nkind of business value.\n\n60\n00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:53.690\nThat's really what it down to, okay.\n\n61\n00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.640\nSo, therefore,\nyou're focused on the value.\n\n62\n00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.780\nRemember the definition of a service is a\nmeans of delivering value to the customer.\n\n63\n00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.640\nWell, a service strategy is trying to\ndetermine both sides of that coin.\n\n64\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.790\nWhat is the value we're trying to\nachieve on behalf of the customer?\n\n65\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.270\nWhat services do we need\nto bring into play?\n\n66\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.110\nTo deliver that value right?\n\n67\n00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.695\nSo let's take a brick and mortar store.\n\n68\n00:04:15.695 --> 00:04:19.080\nThe selling books as we've\nmentioned in other examples.\n\n69\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.740\nBefore the advent and popularity\nof the internet it was a very good\n\n70\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.030\nstrategy to try to gain sales just\nby driving people to the store.\n\n71\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.650\nOf course,\nIT was involved in inventory management.\n\n72\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.180\nThey were involved in perhaps point\nof sale systems and that's important,\n\n73\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.060\nthat brick and mortar organization.\n\n74\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.150\nBut is that same bookstore decided that it\nwas going to be a better strategy to try\n\n75\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.710\nto reach out and\ngo beyond the physical walls and\n\n76\n00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.090\nhave an online store front\nthrough internet sales.\n\n77\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.750\nIT obviously was going to be part of\nthat strategy in a lot different way and\n\n78\n00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.140\nmore embedded with the business and\nhow that's going to work.\n\n79\n00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.830\nSo, again adapting the business strategy\nas it's changing to the IT strategy and\n\n80\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.545\nvice versa is what service strategy\nis trying to figure out, okay.\n\n81\n00:05:09.582 --> 00:05:11.160\nTrying to deliver value.\n\n82\n00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.640\nKeep reinforcing that word I mentioned\nin a couple of the other episodes,\n\n83\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.730\nthe value is gonna be\nthe operating word in many,\n\n84\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.770\nmany of the answers to\nthe question on the exam.\n\n85\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.950\nValue, value, value,\nnot just solutions, right.\n\n86\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.755\nAnd the value is the level to which\n\n87\n00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:31.295\nyou're able to deliver the expectations\nthat the customer has, right?\n\n88\n00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:34.395\nSo maybe it's related to cost.\n\n89\n00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:37.775\nMaybe the customer truly wants you\nto do the same thing for less money.\n\n90\n00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:41.197\nSo it's not that cost isn't important,\nof course it is.\n\n91\n00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:44.457\nRight, but it's not the only\nway that you should measure\n\n92\n00:05:44.457 --> 00:05:46.427\nhow you deliver value\nto your organization.\n\n93\n00:05:46.427 --> 00:05:48.377\n>> Right, cuz something could\nbe extremely expensive.\n\n94\n00:05:48.377 --> 00:05:54.192\nI think of my own experience, where we\nhad IT budget of about $2.5 million.\n\n95\n00:05:54.192 --> 00:05:54.853\n>> Right.\n\n96\n00:05:54.853 --> 00:05:58.459\n>> Right, and we would spend money\non IT and it was 2.5 million.\n\n97\n00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.210\nNow you might be sitting there thinking,\nwow, that's a lot of money.\n\n98\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.900\nOr you might be thinking, wow,\nthey got a small IT shop.\n\n99\n00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.680\nIt depends on your perspective.\n\n100\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.880\n>> Exactly.\n>> But that money was meant to further us,\n\n101\n00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.120\nand create ways for us to create more\nmoney potential in our business.\n\n102\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.800\nSo it just depends on the perspective\nthat you're looking at.\n\n103\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.080\nIf you're looking at\nlike you said earlier,\n\n104\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.120\nIT is this mystery shop that just costs\nus money, you don't see the value in it.\n\n105\n00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.830\nIf you see the values of one of this,\n\n106\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.830\nwe continue to spearhead how\nare business is driven and allow\n\n107\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.600\nit down the avenues where new potential\nmarkets are that we have yet to dip into.\n\n108\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.498\nWell now it's created a whole lot of\nvalue that we would never have before.\n\n109\n00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:45.100\n>> I agree, look at an example,\nlook at banking as an example.\n\n110\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.960\nI rarely go to a physical teller anymore,\nI used to,\n\n111\n00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.060\nI was in front of a teller a lot.\n\n112\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.360\nIT has changed that dynamic and\nmy relationship with the bank.\n\n113\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.820\nAnd I'm not necessarily paying\ndirectly for that new service.\n\n114\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.090\nBut IT is certainly delivering some value\nto that bank, because if the bank can't\n\n115\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.380\nprovide me online banking,\nI'm going to another one, right?\n\n116\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.240\nSo customer attention can be\nthe value you're delivering\n\n117\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.910\nas an IT service provider.\n\n118\n00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.540\nValue can be rendered in lots of ways,\nbesides cost.\n\n119\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.630\n>> That's right.\n\n120\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.600\n>> Okay, so\neffectively what you're trying to do\n\n121\n00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.300\nis focus on three aspects of value\nfrom the customers perspectives.\n\n122\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.020\nAnd this is a good test\ntaking moment here.\n\n123\n00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.425\nThese things could very\nwell show up on the exam.\n\n124\n00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:37.510\nThe three legged stool, the three\nthings that a customer considers.\n\n125\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:44.230\nWhere they consider value or business\noutcomes preferences and perceptions.\n\n126\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:50.020\nAnd to kinda reenforce these three things,\nI want to use a non IT example.\n\n127\n00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.436\nLet's take the business outcome,\nagain forgive me, it's not an IT example.\n\n128\n00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:59.667\nBut consider the business outcome\nare being able to lower the window on your\n\n129\n00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:00.481\nautomobile.\n\n130\n00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:05.431\nYou give that to the IT department and\nthey think about the regulatory risks,\n\n131\n00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:08.262\nthe complexity, the ease to repair, etc.\n\n132\n00:08:08.262 --> 00:08:11.429\nAnd they design you something that\nmeets that business outcome, and\n\n133\n00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:13.770\nthey deliver to you, as the customer.\n\n134\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.140\nAnd you get into the car,\nand it's one of these.\n\n135\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.170\nYou're cranking the window, right?\n\n136\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.360\nThe business outcomes are being met.\n\n137\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.640\nHowever, they may have thought,\nyou know what?\n\n138\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.440\nI like electric windows.\n\n139\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.780\nSo I have a preference for that.\n\n140\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.890\nSo you have to consider that\ntheir preferences are in play.\n\n141\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.970\nAnd you could argue back\nwith them all you want.\n\n142\n00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.340\nSo well, wait a minute, this is cheaper.\n\n143\n00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.750\nThis crank is cheaper.\n\n144\n00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.130\nIt's easier to replace.\n\n145\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.950\nWe have less regulatory risk involved\nbecause if you drive into a lake you could\n\n146\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.120\nstill lower your window, you don't have to\nhave the car running to lower your window,\n\n147\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.470\nwe don't have to fight\nthe regulators any more.\n\n148\n00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.100\nThis is the outcome you wanted.\n\n149\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.785\nAnd if you had that attitude\nas an IP service provider,\n\n150\n00:08:52.785 --> 00:08:55.505\nthe customer could just say, well,\nI'll find someone that will do that.\n\n151\n00:08:55.505 --> 00:08:58.055\nI'll get me someone that can develop\n\n152\n00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:00.975\nme a car window that I\ncould just push a button.\n\n153\n00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:04.715\n>> So you build value by taking\ntheir preferences into consideration\n\n154\n00:09:04.715 --> 00:09:06.605\nas you design the IT structure.\n\n155\n00:09:06.605 --> 00:09:09.480\n>> Absolutely, and again,\nthere's gonna be this tension.\n\n156\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.180\nYou're thinking you're\nbuilding the perfect thing.\n\n157\n00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.260\n>> It's a push pull.\n\n158\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.230\n>> Right, it's a push pull,\nbut you gotta get it right.\n\n159\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.180\nYou certainly can't ignore\nthe preferences, or\n\n160\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.880\nelse the perceptions are gonna be your\nnot delivering the right value, right?\n\n161\n00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.880\nThey may think this is cheap.\n\n162\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.940\nI was in a competitor's car the other day,\nand all I had to do was push a button.\n\n163\n00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.540\nAnd I didn't just have to hold it down,\nI could just press it once.\n\n164\n00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.470\nAnd you get the idea how these\npreferences and perceptions are gonna\n\n165\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.780\nskew the value proposition from\nthe customer's standpoint.\n\n166\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.000\nYou have to know those\nthings as a certifier,\n\n167\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.080\nwhat's going to delight them, what's\ngoing to give them what they need, right?\n\n168\n00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.030\nBut a good test taking moment.\n\n169\n00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.370\nOutcomes, preferences, and\n\n170\n00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.600\nperceptions of the business is what drives\nthe value conversation with the customers.\n\n171\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.990\nThis is rather a busy slide that really\nlikes pointing out to is you must\n\n172\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:06.100\nhave a delivery positive experience,\na net positive difference, right?\n\n173\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.956\nSo if you look at this slide for a second,\nlet me get my pointer going here.\n\n174\n00:10:12.782 --> 00:10:17.661\nIf you see that the reference value,\nsay the business process now\n\n175\n00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:22.640\ntakes five days, right so\n40 hours of work, manual labor to do.\n\n176\n00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.890\nAnd you're gonna introduce\nan IT service that gives them,\n\n177\n00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:31.248\nthey can do it in say,\n16 hours instead of 40 hours.\n\n178\n00:10:31.248 --> 00:10:33.978\nThen you're giving them a net\npositive difference of 24 hours of\n\n179\n00:10:33.978 --> 00:10:35.370\nproductivity, right.\n\n180\n00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:41.007\nNot net yet but you're doing 24 hours\nof positive difference for them.\n\n181\n00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:43.991\nAnd then it takes you a while to\nget the data turned back around and\n\n182\n00:10:43.991 --> 00:10:47.528\nthere's some data latency issues, so\nthere's another eight hours a day to\n\n183\n00:10:47.528 --> 00:10:50.970\nprocessing before they can actually\nuse the outputs of this IT service.\n\n184\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.740\nSo you're taking way\nanother eight hours of it.\n\n185\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.812\nSo the net difference, instead of being\n24 hours of net productivity gains,\n\n186\n00:10:57.812 --> 00:11:00.077\nit's only 16 hours of net productivity.\n\n187\n00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:02.930\nBut at least it's better, right?\n\n188\n00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:08.000\nNow obviously if you introduce such\na service, and the gain was not worth\n\n189\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.940\nanything, it was either zero,\nyou're not gonna invest in that, right.\n\n190\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.480\nOr if it's a negative difference,\nwhere it actually takes them more time or\n\n191\n00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.130\nmore effort.\n\n192\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:20.000\nSo the ultimate thing you're trying to\nget here is that the value is a net gain\n\n193\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.570\nin value as you're trying\nto deliver those, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:28.342\nAnd again, based on those three factors\nof perception, preferences and outcomes.\n\n195\n00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:36.070\nAll right, the way an IT service\nprovider can look at providing value\n\n196\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.280\nis even distilled down into a couple other\nconcepts called utility and warranty.\n\n197\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.030\nAnd again, this is just words\nyou're gonna have to learn, right?\n\n198\n00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.870\nUtility and warranty,\nthis is a good test taking slide here.\n\n199\n00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.570\nUtility equals fitness for purpose.\n\n200\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.880\nThat's worth memorizing.\n\n201\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.140\nWarranty equals fitness for\nuse, another thing to memorize.\n\n202\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.650\nFor me personally,\nit was kind of confusing.\n\n203\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.320\nI always got them mixed up.\n\n204\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.770\nMy memory crutch for\nthat is that the Us don't match.\n\n205\n00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.780\nUtility is fit for\npurpose, not fit for use.\n\n206\n00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.290\nSo the Us do not match.\n\n207\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.940\nJust a little mnemonic device for\nyou to help you remember those things.\n\n208\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.300\nBut let's talk about\nwhat these really mean.\n\n209\n00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.140\nUtility is effectively the functionality\nof a service, if you will,\n\n210\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.440\nthe functionality.\n\n211\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.860\nIt allows someone to do something\nthat they couldn't do before.\n\n212\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.561\nI'll go back,\nin one of our previous episodes,\n\n213\n00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:26.939\ndo you remember the days before email?\n\n214\n00:12:26.939 --> 00:12:31.612\nSo before email, there was paper\nbeing passed around, right,\n\n215\n00:12:31.612 --> 00:12:34.820\nliterally physical inboxes and outboxes.\n\n216\n00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.645\n>> Interoffice memos.\n\n217\n00:12:35.645 --> 00:12:38.610\n>> Interoffice memos, or\na little distribution list where\n\n218\n00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.530\nyou initial that you'd read it and\npassed them around, remember, right?\n\n219\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.884\nAnd obviously email has made that a little\nbit different and a little bit better.\n\n220\n00:12:45.884 --> 00:12:50.400\nSo email actually supports\nperformance in that regard.\n\n221\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.530\nIt's a lot easier.\n\n222\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.942\nYou can send a memo to 5,000 people,\n15,000 people, if you want.\n\n223\n00:12:54.942 --> 00:12:58.900\nYou can get read receipts,\nelectronically back, those kind of things.\n\n224\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.878\nSo it actually transformed that\nparticular communication mechanism,\n\n225\n00:13:02.878 --> 00:13:04.720\njust for memos themselves.\n\n226\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.820\nEmail was supporting a performance, right,\n\n227\n00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.790\nyou can do it a lot easier,\na lot more effectively.\n\n228\n00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.893\nStaying with the email example, utility\ncan also be the removal of constraint.\n\n229\n00:13:15.893 --> 00:13:20.180\nI remember when we first got email,\nin my office.\n\n230\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.939\nWhen we first got email I had to be\nat work on a work on a desktop or\n\n231\n00:13:24.939 --> 00:13:32.000\na laptop from my company, at work, plugged\ninto my network at work period, right?\n\n232\n00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.730\nThen that guy removed that constraint\nwhere you have to be at work, and\n\n233\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.780\nI could check my mail\nthrough the Internet.\n\n234\n00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.540\nI could just have a browser, right,\nlike Outlook Web Access, for instance.\n\n235\n00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.470\nSo that changed,\nthat took away that constraint.\n\n236\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.750\nDidn't have to be to be at work anymore.\n\n237\n00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.400\nAnd then again it just keeps going, right.\n\n238\n00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.410\nNow I can just check my mail on my phone,\n\n239\n00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.820\nright, don't even have to be on a browser\non a desktop, I can have mobile email.\n\n240\n00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.020\nSo again, keep removing constraints.\n\n241\n00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.000\nThat's utility, right?\n\n242\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.122\nIf you can deliver utility and\nthat's either performance supported or\n\n243\n00:14:04.122 --> 00:14:06.730\nconstraints removed,\nthat's what this OR gate is.\n\n244\n00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.960\nIf either of those are true,\nthen you consider it fit for purpose.\n\n245\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.979\nAnd that was the and gate over here.\n\n246\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.570\nAnd means both of these conditions must\nbe supplied before you can deliver value.\n\n247\n00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.010\nSo not only must you deliver utility,\nfunctionality, but\n\n248\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:28.205\nyou also must deliver what's\ncalled warranty, fit for use.\n\n249\n00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:33.325\nSo warranty just means, is this service\neven available for me to use, right?\n\n250\n00:14:33.325 --> 00:14:35.575\nIf it's got the most\nperfect functionality,\n\n251\n00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:39.580\nit let's you do things faster with\nless errors and more efficiency.\n\n252\n00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.660\nBut yet it's never available, then it's\nnot gonna be able to provide value.\n\n253\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.950\nSo if your email system's always down,\n\n254\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.150\nobviously it's not providing\nthe value it should.\n\n255\n00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:51.480\nRight, so warranty deals with\nthose availability factors.\n\n256\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:57.510\nWe'll talk in a bit more detail about each\none of these facets of warranty here,\n\n257\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.060\nbut I'll give you a brief overview now.\n\n258\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.740\nAvailability is simply that is\nthe service available to be used.\n\n259\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.275\nNow that could be affected by capacity,\nenough disk space, enough memory,\n\n260\n00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:11.082\nenough CPU,\nall those kind of things, right?\n\n261\n00:15:11.082 --> 00:15:15.950\nIt also be, is it continuity enough,\ndoes it have enough continuity.\n\n262\n00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:21.770\nSo continuity goes with like if a server\nfails, is the service still up, right?\n\n263\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.760\nIf a network switch goes out,\nis the service still up, right?\n\n264\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.920\nYou have some failures but you have\ncontinuity built into it as well, right?\n\n265\n00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.530\nAnd then security,\nyou could availability covered.\n\n266\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.970\nNice design and you have\na capacity covered, well-designed.\n\n267\n00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.150\nYou could have continuity\ncovered with lots of redundancy.\n\n268\n00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.310\nBut a denial of service attack hits your\nnetwork or a virus attacks your network,\n\n269\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.420\nstarts deleting data everywhere, right?\n\n270\n00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.490\nOr anybody can come in and\nlog in and start grabbing data and\n\n271\n00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.380\nstealing data, right?\n\n272\n00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.210\nSo security is also an aspect\nof how a service can deliver on\n\n273\n00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.095\nthe warranty aspects of it.\n\n274\n00:15:55.095 --> 00:16:00.036\nSo again, take away for test takers,\nmemorize these words, utility, Warranty.\n\n275\n00:16:00.036 --> 00:16:05.610\nMemorize what they're referring to,\nfitness for purpose, fitness for use.\n\n276\n00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.730\nAnd know that they both must be provided,\nbefore you can deliver value.\n\n277\n00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:11.520\nAll right.\n\n278\n00:16:14.355 --> 00:16:15.945\nAgain, some more words.\n\n279\n00:16:15.945 --> 00:16:17.845\nIt's a lot of vocabulary.\n\n280\n00:16:17.845 --> 00:16:18.663\nSo, more words.\n\n281\n00:16:18.663 --> 00:16:20.350\nAssets.\n\n282\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.855\nAn asset is one of two types.\n\n283\n00:16:23.855 --> 00:16:26.730\nIt's either a resource or capability.\n\n284\n00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.090\nA resource is something tangible.\n\n285\n00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.050\nA capability is a skill or a knowledge.\n\n286\n00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:36.750\nAn organizational capability,\nit could be divided in several people.\n\n287\n00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.370\nRight?\n\n288\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.950\nThe capability's intangible.\n\n289\n00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:46.220\nAnd these assets exist in two domains,\nright?\n\n290\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.360\nThey exist within the service and\n\n291\n00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.860\nthey exist within the service\nprovider themselves.\n\n292\n00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.870\nOkay?\n\n293\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.860\nThat's also important to know.\n\n294\n00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.810\nGiving example here.\n\n295\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.180\nYou have your customer assets,\nresources and capabilities.\n\n296\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.661\nYou have your service assets,\nresource and capabilities on one side.\n\n297\n00:17:03.661 --> 00:17:08.480\nAnd the effect of what you're doing is\ncombining service assets with customer\n\n298\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.070\nassets to create that warranty,\nthat value, utility and warranty.\n\n299\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.630\nSo take this as an example.\n\n300\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:24.450\nIT services could help financial managers,\nor financial analyst, do their job.\n\n301\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.010\nIT doesn't have to know\nfinancial management.\n\n302\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.480\nThat's what financial analysts are for.\n\n303\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.660\nSo they have their resources and\ntheir capabilities on the business side.\n\n304\n00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.830\nYou're bringing IT services to them, so\n\n305\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.148\nthat you can combine them to\ngenerate some business outcome.\n\n306\n00:17:40.148 --> 00:17:41.985\nOkay.\n\n307\n00:17:41.985 --> 00:17:47.066\nSo again, resources and capabilities\nis what an asset is, two things,\n\n308\n00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:53.570\nand they exist in two domains, within the\ncustomer and within the service provider.\n\n309\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:58.978\nCustomer assets and service assets\nare combined to create value,\n\n310\n00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:02.970\nall right?\n\n311\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.350\nNow, the three processes.\n\n312\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:11.060\nWe're gonna talk about in order, service\nportfolio, financial management and\n\n313\n00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.180\njust skipped my mind here,\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n314\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.750\nFirst, Service Portfolio management.\n\n315\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.890\nIf the center of the IoT\nuniverse is a service.\n\n316\n00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.570\nThen it makes sense that you\narticulate and delineate and\n\n317\n00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.230\nenumerate what your services are.\n\n318\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.650\nIf you don't have a listing of what\nservice you're currently providing, how\n\n319\n00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.370\ncan you possibly determine what services\nyou're supposed to be providing or\n\n320\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.000\nwhich ones should be retired?\n\n321\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.490\nSo the service portfolio is the process,\nservice portfolio management,\n\n322\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:51.490\nI should say, is the process that enables\nthe articulation of all your services.\n\n323\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:52.410\nOkay?\n\n324\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.050\n>> It's funny, I'm actually doing\na show for IT Pro TV and map,\n\n325\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:02.910\nwhich is a nice little network utility\nthat enumerates services on a computer.\n\n326\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.950\nThat's exactly what it does, it finds\nout what services are running on this\n\n327\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.260\ncomputer, and then list them out for you.\n\n328\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:07.800\n>> Interesting.\n\n329\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.240\n>> So, yeah, it is a little right there.\n\n330\n00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.670\n>> [CROSSTALK] It is\nkind of a coincidence.\n\n331\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.690\n>> The same thing.\n\n332\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:13.680\n>> Coinkydink.\nI like that one.\n\n333\n00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.880\n>> Can I quote you on that one,\ncoinkydink?\n\n334\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.410\n>> Yes.\n>> All right.\n\n335\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.810\nCoinkydink.\n\n336\n00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.660\nYeah, services,\n\n337\n00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:24.060\nof course, software services like\nthe one within operating systems or\n\n338\n00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.220\nwithin network systems are not,\nthey are sets of code operating.\n\n339\n00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.060\nAnd of course in the ITIL sensing\nservices, something big,right?\n\n340\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.300\nSomething big goes beyond the solutions.\n\n341\n00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:39.510\nAs you can see at the bottom of this\nparticular slide, three components of\n\n342\n00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:46.730\nthe portfolio, includes the pipeline,\nthe catalog and retired services.\n\n343\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.890\nThose three portions, and there's a\ngraphical representation on this next one.\n\n344\n00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:58.210\nThe service pipeline is the portion of\nthe portfolio that holds information about\n\n345\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:03.980\nservices that we could be bringing in to\noperations, ones under consideration.\n\n346\n00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.670\nRight?\n\n347\n00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.860\nThe service catalog is the portion\nof the portfolio that deals with,\n\n348\n00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.460\nthat has all the information related\nto current operational services,\n\n349\n00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.440\nthe ones that are currently active, and\nof course retired services is the other\n\n350\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.080\npart of the portfolio and it just list all\nthe services that are already come and\n\n351\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.600\ngone, they're no longer being utilize,\nright?\n\n352\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.650\nThink, step back this for a second,\nwhy do you think it would be important for\n\n353\n00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.930\na service strategy, a service strategist,\nwhy would you think it would be important\n\n354\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:40.230\nfor service strategists to have\nthis kind of view of the portfolio?\n\n355\n00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.747\nA pipeline of things under consideration,\nthe catalogue things that\n\n356\n00:20:44.747 --> 00:20:49.350\nare operational and retired services\n>> I\n\n357\n00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.560\nguess that's a piece of you could know\nof what can and cannot do, right?\n\n358\n00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.400\nThat's part of it,\nif I know what we have available to us,\n\n359\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.480\nthen I am going to able discern what\nwe're gonna be able to in the future or\n\n360\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.910\nneed to accomplish before\nwe can do future ventures.\n\n361\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.765\n>> Right.\n>> That's as far as I got [LAUGH].\n\n362\n00:21:07.765 --> 00:21:08.910\n>> Well, that's good.\nThat's a good way to look at it.\n\n363\n00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:09.540\nIt really is.\n\n364\n00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.760\nIt gives you the basis to have\nan intelligent conversation\n\n365\n00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.760\nabout what services we currently offer and\n\n366\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.320\nwhat ones we should,\nnot necessarily could, should be offering.\n\n367\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.160\nAnd determine if you can\ndeliver those services as well.\n\n368\n00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.520\nSo it gives you the basis to understand\nwhat ITIL refers to as market space.\n\n369\n00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.370\nThe opportunity for additional services.\n\n370\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.350\nThe retired services gives you that\nhistorical context of where you've come.\n\n371\n00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:40.390\nSo if you want to dust it off and bring it\nback in to operational status, you could.\n\n372\n00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.630\nOr, you at least have a show like a record\nlike, yeah, we used to do that but\n\n373\n00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.090\nwe retired it because and then have good\n\n374\n00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.970\nintelligent conversation about why\nwe don't do that service anymore.\n\n375\n00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.840\nRight?\n\n376\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.050\nSuch as group wise.\n\n377\n00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.230\nRemember back in group wise.\n\n378\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.530\nWe had that conversation a little\nbit earlier about group wise.\n\n379\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.956\n>> Foul mouth there.\n\n380\n00:21:56.956 --> 00:21:59.511\n>> [LAUGH] [LAUGH] Right.\n\n381\n00:21:59.511 --> 00:22:02.060\nThis graphic shows a little\nsomething else, too,\n\n382\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.920\nthat the Service Portfolio\nincludes these three parts, and\n\n383\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.160\nthat's something you need to take away for\nthe exam.\n\n384\n00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.790\nAnother thing that's pretty\npowerful to do is that,\n\n385\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:16.110\nif you can link your portfolio to\nunderline configuration management system.\n\n386\n00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:22.050\nThe set of data and information about all\nthe assets underneath these services.\n\n387\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.600\nSo, as an example,\nif you have a service called email.\n\n388\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.100\nRight, it's currently active,\n\n389\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.000\nit's in your service catalog,\nyour messaging service, if you will.\n\n390\n00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.150\n>> I do have that, actually.\n\n391\n00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.028\n>> You do have a messaging service.\n\n392\n00:22:32.028 --> 00:22:33.110\n>> I'm with you.\n\n393\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.350\n>> All right.\n\n394\n00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.520\nUnderneath that service could\nbe any number of servers.\n\n395\n00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:44.370\nAnd databases and\nmaybe they had 16 changes this week and\n\n396\n00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.040\n250 incidents this month and\nthose kind of things.\n\n397\n00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.160\nIf you can get all that information\nrolled up to a service, the CMS can\n\n398\n00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.880\nhave that underlying data, if you can\nroll it up to link it to a given service.\n\n399\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.800\nYou can do some very powerful analysis\nabout what it costs to deliver a service,\n\n400\n00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.746\nhow complex it is, okay?\n\n401\n00:23:03.746 --> 00:23:05.823\nAll right.\n\n402\n00:23:08.234 --> 00:23:10.710\nHypothetical situation,\nchange of subject here.\n\n403\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.260\nYou have to have situation,\nmy first day of employment.\n\n404\n00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:19.730\nSit down, call the service desk and\nsay, hey, I'm new here.\n\n405\n00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:23.370\nI'd like access to the HR database.\n\n406\n00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.487\nI'd like to review everyone's salaries.\n\n407\n00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:28.150\n>> That's what I do every\ntime I start a new job.\n\n408\n00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.329\nThat's the exact words\nthe thing that I do.\n\n409\n00:23:30.329 --> 00:23:32.894\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n410\n00:23:32.894 --> 00:23:34.760\n>> So, appreciate the humor there.\n\n411\n00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.070\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It's meant to be humourous.\n\n412\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.814\nMost folks would say,\nwell that's ridiculous.\n\n413\n00:23:37.814 --> 00:23:40.033\n>> Yeah.\n>> No way is that service test gonna say,\n\n414\n00:23:40.033 --> 00:23:42.517\nyeah, sure Terry you can have access,\nbut why?\n\n415\n00:23:42.517 --> 00:23:44.750\nWhy would the service-\n>> Like it's on our Internet site,\n\n416\n00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.315\njust go there and click the button.\n\n417\n00:23:46.315 --> 00:23:48.468\n[LAUGH]\n>> Why would the service desk just\n\n418\n00:23:48.468 --> 00:23:52.156\nhave it, I appreciate that\nyou're getting the humor here,\n\n419\n00:23:52.156 --> 00:23:56.367\nis that why would a service desk\neven entertain that kind of request?\n\n420\n00:23:56.367 --> 00:23:57.846\n>> Why would they entertain\nthat kind of request?\n\n421\n00:23:57.846 --> 00:24:02.845\nBecause you are the person that\nis working in that sphere.\n\n422\n00:24:02.845 --> 00:24:04.580\nThat you need that access.\n\n423\n00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.620\nIt's what we call role base access.\n\n424\n00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.480\n>> Could be.\n\n425\n00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.570\nYeah, so\nyou basically get it then is that,\n\n426\n00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:14.010\nthere's processes in place that prevent\nthe service desk from saying, yeah, Terry,\n\n427\n00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.350\ngo ahead and have this access.\n\n428\n00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:20.040\nRight, those rules of engagement,\nthose methods of operations,\n\n429\n00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.160\nrole based access are gonna\nbe part of that dilemma.\n\n430\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.770\nAnd, it's probably gonna come from an HR\nperson, instead of me calling a service\n\n431\n00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.670\ndesk, an HR manager is going to come and\nrequest this access on my behalf,\n\n432\n00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.810\nthere's gonna be something in play,\nthe kind of governs that behavior.\n\n433\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.610\nAnd that's what governance is about,\nright?\n\n434\n00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.090\nA governance is not just\ntelling good processes and\n\n435\n00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.910\nplace it's having the good rules and\npolicy in place and\n\n436\n00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:47.920\ntogether the good rules, policy and\ngood processes are going to form\n\n437\n00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.200\nthis governance model that you need,\nsomehow guiding people on their way.\n\n438\n00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.515\nThat's what governance is about.\n\n439\n00:24:57.872 --> 00:25:01.820\nAll right, again some more words,\na business case.\n\n440\n00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.540\nIt's not a grand eloquent definition here.\n\n441\n00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.700\nA decision support and planning tool\nthat projects likely consequences\n\n442\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.230\nof a financially significant\nbusiness action.\n\n443\n00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.490\nPut another way, it's the justification\nfor spending a lot of money.\n\n444\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.380\nSo what's a lot of money?\n\n445\n00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.732\n>> A lot of money is $47 billion.\n\n446\n00:25:25.732 --> 00:25:27.065\n>> That would be a lot.\n\n447\n00:25:27.065 --> 00:25:30.350\nYou'd probably need a business case if you\nwanna spend that much money exactly right.\n\n448\n00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.190\nI once had, the called it at my\norganization, grant of authority,\n\n449\n00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.810\nmeaning I had, by directive,\nI had the authority to\n\n450\n00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.990\nauthorize spending of $50,000 without\nasking for anybody's permission.\n\n451\n00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:45.650\nThat's significant, so\n\n452\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.380\nthat's where they drew that line\nat my level in the organization.\n\n453\n00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.820\nHowever my boss insisted that\nif I wanted to spend more\n\n454\n00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.150\nthan $1,500 I needed to come to him with\na justification for why I wanted to do it.\n\n455\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.970\nSo significant for my boss was not\nthe same as the directive laid out.\n\n456\n00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.490\nSo significant is nebulous word, right?\n\n457\n00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.840\nFinance this significant business action.\n\n458\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.240\nSo it's kind of a define your own\nsignificance in this definition, and\n\n459\n00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.720\nthat's totally fine.\n\n460\n00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.440\nBut the point of this is that,\nif it is significant, whatever that means,\n\n461\n00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.440\na business case should be provided,\nshowing the justification.\n\n462\n00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.820\nWhat's the pluses and minuses?\n\n463\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.570\nWhat's the value we're\ngonna get out of this?\n\n464\n00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.480\nWhy should we spend this much\nmoney on this particular activity.\n\n465\n00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.570\nThat's what a business case is.\n\n466\n00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.520\nSo you're dealing with the objectives and\nthe impact and\n\n467\n00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.230\nthe risks,\nincluding the risk of doing nothing.\n\n468\n00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.430\nAnd speaking or risk.\n\n469\n00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.250\n>> My favorite.\n\n470\n00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.328\n>> Yeah.\n>> Risk management.\n\n471\n00:26:40.328 --> 00:26:44.340\n>> Risk management, ITIL is not\na risk management discipline or\n\n472\n00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.040\na best practice, they give it\na big nod here as they should.\n\n473\n00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:48.990\nRight?\n\n474\n00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:54.990\nRisk Management is something you should\ndefinitely consider, you see MOR here,\n\n475\n00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:59.360\nyou can go to various frameworks,\nlook on the internet and get those.\n\n476\n00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.940\nThere's no particular test questions or\ndirectives or in the syllabus\n\n477\n00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.190\nthat are gonna drive you to a lot of\ntest question on risk management, so\n\n478\n00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.480\nI won't believe in this.\n\n479\n00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.547\nBut obviously having a formal\napproach to risk management\n\n480\n00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:15.624\ncan be beneficial to your IT organization.\n\n481\n00:27:15.624 --> 00:27:16.124\nAll right?\n\n482\n00:27:19.535 --> 00:27:25.127\nThe portfolio we just talked about\nin much detail with the portfolio.\n\n483\n00:27:25.127 --> 00:27:26.840\nWe have several slides here to go through.\n\n484\n00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.570\nMoving on to financial management for\nIT services.\n\n485\n00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:32.920\nOkay.\n\n486\n00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.110\nAgain, nothing really magical\nabout this definition.\n\n487\n00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.730\nWe're not driving deep\ninto financial management.\n\n488\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.120\nThe purpose of financial management for IT\nservices is to ensure that the right funds\n\n489\n00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.560\nare available for the right investment.\n\n490\n00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.953\nSo to do that you have to have some\nintelligent data available to you.\n\n491\n00:27:48.953 --> 00:27:51.595\nSome intelligence to bring to that.\n\n492\n00:27:51.595 --> 00:27:56.790\nSo financial management is trying to\nenable the capturing of that intelligence.\n\n493\n00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.590\nHow much do things cost?\n\n494\n00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.620\nWhat is the benefit of\nspending this much money?\n\n495\n00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.950\nThere are three activities associated\nwith Financial Management,\n\n496\n00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:13.370\nworth memorizing by the way, test takers,\nbudgeting, accounting, and charging.\n\n497\n00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:15.150\nAnd I'll challenge Daniel\na little bit here.\n\n498\n00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.750\nYou know the difference between\nbudgeting and accounting, by any chance?\n\n499\n00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:21.670\n>> Budgeting and accounting.\n\n500\n00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.240\nOkay so, budgeting is saying here's\nhow much money we want to, or\n\n501\n00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.750\nare allocating, for whatever,\nyou know, pick your topic.\n\n502\n00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.730\nAnd accounting is how much have\nwe actually spent and used.\n\n503\n00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:33.450\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n504\n00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.560\nSo budgeting is the predictive part.\n\n505\n00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.110\nHere's how much we think we need.\n\n506\n00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.330\nIt's right.\nIt's the projected spend.\n\n507\n00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.550\nRight?\nAnd accounting is the actual spend, right?\n\n508\n00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.880\nThose two activities, again,\n\n509\n00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.090\nnot rewriting financial management here,\npretty basic concepts.\n\n510\n00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.820\nAnd these basic concepts can\nhelp you on the exam, right?\n\n511\n00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.060\nUnderstanding what budgeting and\naccounting are and\n\n512\n00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.700\nknowing that those are two activities that\nmust be done in financial management.\n\n513\n00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.510\nThis third activity, charging,\nis something that is optional,\n\n514\n00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.640\ndepending on what kind of\nservice provider you are.\n\n515\n00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.110\nProbably a provider to\nexternal customers for\n\n516\n00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.970\nmaking money is going to charge for\nthose things.\n\n517\n00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.480\nRight, so it's not optional in that case.\n\n518\n00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.290\nBut if you consider an internal service\nprovider that's part of the same\n\n519\n00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.900\norganization, they might\nnot have charge backs.\n\n520\n00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.070\nIt may not be,\nit may just all be done through budgets.\n\n521\n00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.080\nAnd perhaps there's cost centers with\nsome notional charging involved, but\n\n522\n00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.720\ncharging itself is an optional\nactivity when you consider\n\n523\n00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.230\nthe big scope of financial management.\n\n524\n00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.760\nDepending on what kind of\norganization you are right?\n\n525\n00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.680\nTwo are mandatory.\n\n526\n00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.290\nBudgeting and accounting.\n\n527\n00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:39.120\nProjecting, inactuals, but\ncharging would be an optional one okay?\n\n528\n00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.888\nBusiness Relationship Management.\n\n529\n00:29:42.888 --> 00:29:46.200\nMoving on to the third and\nfinal process in service strategy.\n\n530\n00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:52.300\nAs the name implies, the purpose of the\nbusiness relationship management process\n\n531\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.250\nis to establish and\nmaintain business relationships.\n\n532\n00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.810\nEffectively, what it's trying to do\nis understand the business needs.\n\n533\n00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.490\nAnd make sure those\nbusiness needs are met.\n\n534\n00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:09.710\nTherefore managing customers expectations\nalong the way and making sure that their\n\n535\n00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:14.760\nperceptions and their preferences and\nthe outcomes are actually achieved.\n\n536\n00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.810\nIn other words that value is delivered,\nthat is the objectives.\n\n537\n00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.440\nThe scope of business\nrelationship management.\n\n538\n00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.080\nWhether it's an internal or\nexternal provider,\n\n539\n00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.930\nis making sure your aligning your\nservice assets to customers’ needs.\n\n540\n00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.750\nRight?\n\n541\n00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:36.960\nNow, let's take this to step back\nas we close off this episode.\n\n542\n00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.490\nWe talked about service portfolio\nmanagement and the portfolio itself.\n\n543\n00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.420\nWe talked about financial management for\nIT services.\n\n544\n00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.820\nAnd we talked about business\nrelationship management.\n\n545\n00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.340\nAnd just pause and reflect for a minute.\n\n546\n00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:52.360\nDoes it make sense that you want\nthese processes in play early\n\n547\n00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:55.140\nin the lifecycle of a service.\n\n548\n00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.600\nThat you want to do this, again,\nin service strategy, the very first one.\n\n549\n00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.700\nRight?\nDoesn't it make\n\n550\n00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.150\nsense that you want to\nconsider business relationship\n\n551\n00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.340\nmanagement early on in a lifecycle of a\nservice even before it's launched, right?\n\n552\n00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.060\nDon't you want to understand\nthe finances involved?\n\n553\n00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.560\nIf you wanna launch a new service and\n\n554\n00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.110\ndon't you wanna understand\nthe on going portfolio.\n\n555\n00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.820\nSo, you understand what services\nare in play, which one can be in play.\n\n556\n00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.530\nI want you to keep reminding\nyourself as we go to these processes\n\n557\n00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.280\nof why the IT librarian so to speak.\n\n558\n00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.470\nWhy those writers would try to\ngroup this as a strategic activity.\n\n559\n00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.290\nSomething early in\nthe lifecycle of a service.\n\n560\n00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:40.306\nAgain this is to reinforce the idea of\nthe lifecycle stages that we go through.\n\n561\n00:31:40.306 --> 00:31:42.956\nAny questions?\n\n562\n00:31:42.956 --> 00:31:48.750\n[LAUGH]\n>> You did the wrong shot.\n\n563\n00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.510\n>> All right.\n\n564\n00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.770\nAny questions or\n>> Yeah.\n\n565\n00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:52.320\nYeah!\n\n566\n00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.500\nWell, is there anything\nelse that we need to know?\n\n567\n00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.140\nBecause it does\n\n568\n00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.850\nlook like our time is expiring\n>> Yup.\n\n569\n00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.660\n>> Quite soon.\n\n570\n00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.210\n>> It's good.\n\n571\n00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.400\nThat's it for Service Strategy.\n\n572\n00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.940\n>> Awesome.\n>> Up next is Service Design.\n\n573\n00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:01.460\n>> Well, excellent.\n\n574\n00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.260\nWe look forward to that.\n\n575\n00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.010\nObviously there's a good reason that we\nshouldn't just get out there and wing it.\n\n576\n00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.670\n>> Because if you think we'll\njust run this business.\n\n577\n00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:10.070\nIt will be super easy.\n\n578\n00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.827\nI didn't know that that router\nwas gonna cost $50,000 though.\n\n579\n00:32:13.827 --> 00:32:15.280\nYou know, yeah.\n\n580\n00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.440\nSo it's probably, like you said,\na good idea to have a plan beforehand,\n\n581\n00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.880\nstart thinking of these things beforehand.\n\n582\n00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.910\nAs much pre-planning as you can do before\nyou jump into the deep end of that pool,\n\n583\n00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.180\nit's probably going to help out a lot.\n\n584\n00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.350\nSo we look forward to\nthe next episode as well.\n\n585\n00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.630\nBut Terry looks like our time\nhas expired from this one.\n\n586\n00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:33.410\nSo where gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n587\n00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.210\nI have been you host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n588\n00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.920\n>> And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n589\n00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.342\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n590\n00:32:38.342 --> 00:32:45.321\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.320\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.930\nAnd in today's episode we\nare moving forward with more\n\n5\n00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.180\non our ITIL Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.322\nJoining us back in the studio, you know\nwho it is, you know him, you love him,\n\n7\n00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:25.247\nhe's number one in your hearts.\n\n8\n00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:27.540\nOur good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.360\nTerry, welcome back, sir, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.020\n>> I'm glad to be back, thanks much.\n\n11\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.530\nAnd as you recall,\nwe've done service strategy.\n\n12\n00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.480\nNow, we're going to dive into the second\nof our five life cycle stages,\n\n13\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.940\nservice design.\n\n14\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.220\nAnd it's a big one, this one's gonna\nbe broken up into a couple episodes.\n\n15\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.950\nIf you look on your screen there,\nyou can see that in fact,\n\n16\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.700\nthere is eight processes\nin service design.\n\n17\n00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.470\nAnd before we get to those processes,\nwe're gonna be talking about some of\n\n18\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.800\nthe high level aspects of design stage at\nlarge and pick up some good vocabulary.\n\n19\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.980\nAs always we need to learn a few words.\n\n20\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.682\n>> They love it,\nthe ITIL learn their vocab.\n\n21\n00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:04.080\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n22\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.050\nThere will be words.\n\n23\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.920\nThere will be words so\nwe'll get to some of those as well.\n\n24\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.410\n>> And words that describe those words.\n\n25\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.400\nThat'll be fun.\n\n26\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.400\n>> Exactly.\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n27\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.590\nAnd again the purpose of service design, a\nlittle bit of tongue in cheek here, is to\n\n28\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.310\ndesign services effectively and to make\nsure you're satisfying service strategy.\n\n29\n00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.750\nBut I want to focus\na little bit on service as\n\n30\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.470\nopposed to solutions design or\nsystems design or architectural design.\n\n31\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.313\nI want to focus on service design just for\na little bit.\n\n32\n00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:39.540\nAnd to just basically highlight a story\nfrom a few years ago, early 2000s.\n\n33\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.780\nI wasn't at the meeting, but I can imagine\nthis meeting of the IT infrastructure\n\n34\n00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.040\nfolks, they're in a meeting and someone\nsuggested that there's been a lot of\n\n35\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.600\npeople talking about the need for\nhaving work team FileShares.\n\n36\n00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.370\nYou had your personal FileShares but\n\n37\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.860\nwork teams need their FileShares\ntooAnd the premise being,\n\n38\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.670\na team leader could gain a FileShare and\nthen be able to administer as he wish.\n\n39\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.800\nPasses out permissions as he wants to.\n\n40\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.930\nIt's a good idea.\n\n41\n00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.430\nAnd Jimmy was a server FileShare guy,\nhe was in the room.\n\n42\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.860\nHe says yeah, we can do that.\n\n43\n00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.450\nI'll get some more storage for us.\n\n44\n00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790\nI'll allocate it.\n\n45\n00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.610\nAnd let's just make it happen, right?\n\n46\n00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.160\nSo I'm not sure how the meeting\nadjourned but Jimmy was the man,\n\n47\n00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.910\nhe was gonna get this done.\n\n48\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.410\nI was a work team leader.\n\n49\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.130\nI happened to be the technical operations\nmanager for a learning management system.\n\n50\n00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.370\nAnd I needed FileShare,\nexactly what of need I had.\n\n51\n00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.190\nAnd here was the infrastructure\nteam gonna supply that need.\n\n52\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.160\nSo I called Jimmy, because I heard\nabout it on the elevator sometime or\n\n53\n00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.440\nat a water cooler, and Jimmy was the man.\n\n54\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.460\nSo I give Jimmy a call and\nsay, I need some FileShares.\n\n55\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.970\nI need five gigs worth of space.\n\n56\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.550\nHe said, I'm sorry,\nyou can only have 1 gig.\n\n57\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.150\nI said, what do you mean only one gig?\n\n58\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.440\nI need five gigs.\n\n59\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.310\nI said, well can I have five one gigs?\n\n60\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.740\nAnd Jimmy said, okay, yeah.\n\n61\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.320\nYou can have five one gig FileShares.\n\n62\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.960\nSo, all right.\n\n63\n00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.860\nI've got my five, one gig FileShares.\n\n64\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.350\nAnd I was storing things for\nmy work team like XML files,\n\n65\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.550\njar files, just various things to\ndevelop this learning management system.\n\n66\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.800\nAnd pictures here and\ngraphics there, all kinds of stuff.\n\n67\n00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.730\nOne Saturday morning I come in with\nmy work team, 8:00 in the morning,\n\n68\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.790\nwe're gonna be rolling out this\nlearning management system.\n\n69\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.198\nIt's going live on Monday.\n\n70\n00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:24.330\nI come in on Saturday and\nthe FileShares aren't there.\n\n71\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.940\nAnd Jimmy's nowhere to be found, right.\n\n72\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.625\nI don't know what I'm gonna do.\n\n73\n00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:30.960\n1:00 in the afternoon,\nI still haven't got the work, right.\n\n74\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.560\nAnd Jimmy happens to get back to me and\nSays, yeah, what are you doing, Terry?\n\n75\n00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.280\nI said, well I'm trying to build out my\nlearning management system this week and\n\n76\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.150\nthe FileShares aren't ready.\n\n77\n00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.590\nHe says, well of course they're not ready.\n\n78\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.070\nWe maintain the servers on the weekend.\n\n79\n00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.650\nThat's when we do maintenance.\n\n80\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.090\nThey were probably being patched or\nsomething.\n\n81\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.260\nI don't know what was going on.\n\n82\n00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.420\nBut that's why they're not available.\n\n83\n00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.730\nThey're not supposed to be\navailable on the weekend.\n\n84\n00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.850\nI said, we didn't tell me that.\n\n85\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.890\nI didn't know.\n\n86\n00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.780\nAnd he said, and spy what are you doing?\n\n87\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.720\nI said, well I'm storing these\nartifacts that I need for developing.\n\n88\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.820\nHe said, you're not suppose\nto store that stuff there.\n\n89\n00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.520\nSo there I was,\nfive hours late to my project.\n\n90\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.020\nI got it done, I got launched on time.\n\n91\n00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.870\nBut I did understand even without given\n\n92\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.380\nwords that there was a difference between\na service and a solution on that very day.\n\n93\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.020\nIs that I didn't know\nthe rules of engagement fully.\n\n94\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.030\nI didn't know that I was not supposed to\nkeep my source code like things in there.\n\n95\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.730\nI didn't know that it wasn't going\nto be available on a Saturday.\n\n96\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.000\nNo one told me, right?\n\n97\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.740\nThat sort of thing.\n\n98\n00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.025\nSo when you're designing a service,\nyou can't simply design a solution and\n\n99\n00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:30.895\nprop it up, right.\n\n100\n00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:34.335\nIt has to have these other things\naround like governance, like process,\n\n101\n00:04:34.335 --> 00:04:37.425\nlike communications,\nlike change control communications,\n\n102\n00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:39.940\nlike who to call when it's not available.\n\n103\n00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.070\nThose types of things.\n\n104\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.140\nCuz I called the service desk,\nthey had no clue.\n\n105\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.980\nThis was Jimmy's idea, right.\n\n106\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.840\nIt wasn't that the service\ndesk didn't support it.\n\n107\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.870\nIt was kind of IT for IT so\nthey didn't think they needed to care.\n\n108\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.205\nWell, ITIL has a different\napproach to that.\n\n109\n00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:55.310\nITIL suggests you care, right.\n\n110\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.370\nAnd to understand who's using\nthese solutions as a service,\n\n111\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.730\nnot just something you prop and\nhopes works.\n\n112\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.810\nSo when you consider service design,\nyou must consider a lot broader sphere\n\n113\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.750\nof controls and processes and\nmechanisms that make it work.\n\n114\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.620\nIt's not simply propping up a solution.\n\n115\n00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.750\nSo you're answering lots of questions\nwhen you do a service design.\n\n116\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.480\nSo the scope of service design is\n\n117\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.550\nbroadly, just making sure you deliver\nthe right processes, the right procedures,\n\n118\n00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.350\nthe right solutions are part of it,\nsystems are part of it.\n\n119\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.630\nSo, it's not that those\nthings aren't valuable.\n\n120\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.088\nIt's just they aren't the only thing.\n\n121\n00:05:41.088 --> 00:05:42.910\n>> Right, all right.\n\n122\n00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:49.230\n>> Service design is intended to deliver\non lots of different business values.\n\n123\n00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.710\nCertainly on reducing total cost of\nownership by being good at this, right?\n\n124\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.290\nYou don't need to reinvent the wheel\nevery time you need to design a service.\n\n125\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.510\nYou have repeatable processes that work,\nso you can do that effectively.\n\n126\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.990\nYou can respond to business needs quickly,\n\n127\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.894\nif you're really gonna therefore reduce\nthe total cost of ownership as well.\n\n128\n00:06:05.894 --> 00:06:14.130\nAll right, the four Ps,\ndefinitely worth memorizing.\n\n129\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.240\nTest takers.\n\n130\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.640\nThe four Ps of service design.\n\n131\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.380\nThe way I remember it is two are related\nto people and two have prose.\n\n132\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.130\nPeople and partners are the people ones.\n\n133\n00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.400\nProcesses and\nproducts are the pros, if you will.\n\n134\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.170\nTwo people and two pros.\n\n135\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.760\nAgain, not just thinking\nabout solutions here.\n\n136\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.880\nIn fact only one of these\nPs deals with the solution.\n\n137\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.220\nThat's the product side,\nthat's where the technology is.\n\n138\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.320\nIT delivers technical solutions or\nproducts, sure they do.\n\n139\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.290\nSo that's really the only aspect here\n\n140\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.360\nthat's related to just the technology\nstuff, just the solution side.\n\n141\n00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.930\nThe rest of them are related to\nthe things that make it a service.\n\n142\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.770\nWhat processes are in place?\n\n143\n00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.350\nWhat people need to be trained?\n\n144\n00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.990\nWhat people are involved,\n\n145\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.220\non the business side, as well as on\nthe service provider side, right?\n\n146\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.170\nAnd of course, we don't deliver anything\nin IT these days without having some sort\n\n147\n00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.330\nof supplier involved.\n\n148\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.610\nWhether it be for software or for\nservers or for printer cartridges or\n\n149\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.320\nwhatever our partners,\nour suppliers or third party partners\n\n150\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.530\nare gonna be part of the solution as well,\nto make sure they're properly engaged.\n\n151\n00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.640\nAnd again, I wanna ask you to keep in mind\n\n152\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.530\nthe value of this happening early\nin the life cycle of a service.\n\n153\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.970\nYou don't think of these things later,\n\n154\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.460\nafter you've launched the service,\nbecause you're gonna stumble.\n\n155\n00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.820\nYou think of them early.\n\n156\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.410\nSo that's why these considerations\nare early in the life cycle of the service\n\n157\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.860\nin service design.\n\n158\n00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.360\nOkay.\n\n159\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.110\nAnother way to consider\nthe aspects of service design is\n\n160\n00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.590\nthese five major aspects here.\n\n161\n00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.220\nYou've go the four P's and\nhere's some other ones.\n\n162\n00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.590\nAnd some of them are redundant, for\n\n163\n00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.490\ninstance under processes,\nnumber five here.\n\n164\n00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.784\nProcesses is one of the Ps, right.\n\n165\n00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:04.860\nService Solutions, number one here.\n\n166\n00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.257\nService Solutions is really kind of\nrelated to the To the products side of\n\n167\n00:08:08.257 --> 00:08:09.211\nthings over there.\n\n168\n00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:11.211\nRight?\nSo some of these are overlap.\n\n169\n00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:15.500\nBut here's the five major\naspects of service design.\n\n170\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.690\nUnderstanding your own\ntool sets within IT.\n\n171\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.380\nSo your management information systems and\ntools.\n\n172\n00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.460\nHow are you gonna manage this service?\n\n173\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.610\nConsider Jimmy and\nthe file shares situation.\n\n174\n00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.292\nHe gave me five 1 Gig file shares.\n\n175\n00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:35.420\nHe needsto be able to know if I'm running\nout of space, for instance, or If I'm\n\n176\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.750\nnot managing administration, security\nwise, too many people have access,\n\n177\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.720\nmaybe I grant seven people administrative\naccess to them when I shouldn't have.\n\n178\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.960\nSo being able to look at\nthat particular service and\n\n179\n00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.310\nmanage it is what management\ninformation systems is about.\n\n180\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.740\nAnd, of course your technology and\nmanagement architectures.\n\n181\n00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.850\nIs it a web server?\n\n182\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.650\nIs it client server?\n\n183\n00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.380\nIs it web based?\n\n184\n00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.100\nThose kinds of architectures are in place,\nas well as the management architectures.\n\n185\n00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.120\nWho Is responsible for\napproving these changes here, and\n\n186\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.490\nwho is responsible for implementing these\nchanges there, those sort of things.\n\n187\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.440\nAnd then coming up with\neffective means of measurements.\n\n188\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.720\nMeasurements, methods, and metrics.\n\n189\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.120\nIf you and your service or\n\n190\n00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.850\nthe business have promised that you\ncould deliver a hundred changes a month.\n\n191\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.860\nDo you have the ability\nto actually monitor\n\n192\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.200\nthe volume of changes that\nservice is gonna have?\n\n193\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.590\nCan you keep score, right?\n\n194\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.660\nIf you're promising a very\nhighly responsive service desk,\n\n195\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.210\nare you measuring the responsiveness\nof the service desk?\n\n196\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:45.810\nSo, if you're gonna promise something then\nyou need to be able to measure it and\n\n197\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:51.300\nservice design is where you ensure you\nhave those methods of measurement in play.\n\n198\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:51.800\nOkay.\n\n199\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.560\nAnd these next several slides\nare related to those things.\n\n200\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.890\nOkay.\n\n201\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.532\nThe Service Design package this is big.\n\n202\n00:10:03.532 --> 00:10:09.410\nWhen you're designing a service,\n\n203\n00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:16.470\nand you're considering those four P's,\npeople, partners, processes and products.\n\n204\n00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:21.050\nWhen you consider those four P's, there's\nlots of t's to cross and i's to dot.\n\n205\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.670\nThere's lots of things\nyou have to get together.\n\n206\n00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.530\nThink about just on the solutions side.\n\n207\n00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.340\nOn the solutions side you're\ngonna need business requirements,\n\n208\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.480\nsystem requirements, maybe a design\nspecification an architectural diagram,\n\n209\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.520\npictures of the way\nthe solution is designed.\n\n210\n00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.510\nPerhaps you're going to need to define\nsome processes like change management\n\n211\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.080\nprocesses, instrument management processes\nor what requests are gonna be allowed.\n\n212\n00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.196\nI need a new headset.\n\n213\n00:10:47.196 --> 00:10:48.450\nI need a new server.\n\n214\n00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.990\nI need a new file share.\n\n215\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.610\nHow are you going to engage the business\non those kinds of requests right?\n\n216\n00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.830\nSo lots of things to ask and\nhave an answer to.\n\n217\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.782\nThe service design package is really\nthe answer to all those questions right?\n\n218\n00:11:02.782 --> 00:11:05.030\nThey usually come in\nthe form of documents.\n\n219\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.340\nSo the name package is a good name.\n\n220\n00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.680\nAnd then there's probably\na stack of things.\n\n221\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.530\nIt's the business requirements document\nfollowed by the service requirements\n\n222\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.040\ndocuments, the design specs,\narchitectural diagram.\n\n223\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.370\nAll of those deliverables that answer\nthe question what's this gonna take for\n\n224\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.800\nthis service to be successful?\n\n225\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.030\nAnd those artifacts, those documents,\nif you will, are collected and\n\n226\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.980\nbecome part of the primary\ndeliverable of service design.\n\n227\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.255\nThe service design package.\n\n228\n00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:37.055\n>> Man Terry if only we had a list of\nthose specific artifacts, there it is.\n\n229\n00:11:37.055 --> 00:11:38.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's on the screen.\n\n230\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.340\nYeah, some of those things, exactly right.\n\n231\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.520\nSome of the things.\n\n232\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.180\nAnd this is not an exhaustive list.\n\n233\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.020\nIt could be lots of different things.\n\n234\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.220\n>> Does it change depending\non your environment or\n\n235\n00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.156\njust whatever you decide to create.\n\n236\n00:11:48.156 --> 00:11:53.140\n>> Absolutely,\nit changes based on each service right?\n\n237\n00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.490\nSome of them might be\nrepeatable like say for\n\n238\n00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:00.775\nexample the service is gonna need\na request fulfillment process.\n\n239\n00:12:00.775 --> 00:12:04.675\nYou might already have that defined so\nyou don't have to go redefine the process.\n\n240\n00:12:04.675 --> 00:12:05.675\nYou just got to point to it.\n\n241\n00:12:05.675 --> 00:12:09.585\nI'll give an example of how this\nwas executed in my own experience.\n\n242\n00:12:09.585 --> 00:12:14.510\nThe service design package was\neffectively it became a SharePoint\n\n243\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.920\nlist at one time but it was just an Excel\nspreadsheet with all the deliverables that\n\n244\n00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.410\nneeded to be delivered before this\nservice was considered ready.\n\n245\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.930\nSo this is the question.\n\n246\n00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.020\nDo you have a business\nrequirements document approved?\n\n247\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.070\nYes.\n\n248\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.130\nThere's the check but it also led to,\n\n249\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.210\nthere was a link, to that actual artifact,\nthe business requirements this document.\n\n250\n00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:40.390\nSame thing for service, service\nrequirements or system requirements.\n\n251\n00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.360\nDesign specification\narchitectural diagram.\n\n252\n00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.850\nDo you have an asset\nmanagement process ready?\n\n253\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.800\nYes.\nWe can answer the questions but\n\n254\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.030\nthen we actually point at those documents.\n\n255\n00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.940\n>> So just saying yes is\nnot enough of a qualifier.\n\n256\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.010\nActually proving that our yes is correct.\n\n257\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.770\n>> Exactly, and showing that artifact.\n\n258\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.600\nSo the service design package is\nnot just an answer to the question,\n\n259\n00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.940\nyes we have one.\n\n260\n00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.280\nHere it is.\n>> Here's the proof.\n\n261\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.440\n>> Here's the proof, and\nreference it as you need to.\n\n262\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.480\nAnd different people reference it over\nthe life cycle of that service, right.\n\n263\n00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.130\nYou can go back to it, you can use it\nto support your training program later.\n\n264\n00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.610\nYou can use it to support any\nnumber of knowledge transfer\n\n265\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.610\nquestions you might have as you go\nthrough development of that service.\n\n266\n00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.389\nAs we dug before management\ninformation systems and tools.\n\n267\n00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.150\nThey help you manage a service.\n\n268\n00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.390\nIt's a keyword here.\n\n269\n00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.650\nThe word tools in the Itel\nparlance in vocabulary,\n\n270\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.950\ntools means things that IT uses.\n\n271\n00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.520\nSolutions are things that customers\nconsume, or users consume.\n\n272\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.650\nIt's just a vocab check there,\nbut that's what those are.\n\n273\n00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.150\nOkay.\n\n274\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.740\nThere's a mention down here of the service\nknowledge management system, the SKMS.\n\n275\n00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.630\nWe will have a good amount of discussion\nabout the SKMS a little bit later.\n\n276\n00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.245\n>> Okay.\n\n277\n00:13:57.669 --> 00:13:59.260\n>> Technology and\nmanagement architectures.\n\n278\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.560\nThis deals with your infrastructure and\nyour organization.\n\n279\n00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.480\nThat's the architecture of your\norganization, as well as the architecture\n\n280\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.230\nof your infrastructure, and\nhow those work together.\n\n281\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.980\nI mentioned that before.\n\n282\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.900\nI mentioned measurement and\nmethods earlier.\n\n283\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.020\nYou can have your progress metrics,\nsuch as,\n\n284\n00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.240\nhow's the project going\nwithin your milestones.\n\n285\n00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.710\nCompliance metrics, how many people are\nfollowing the processes effectiveness, or\n\n286\n00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.710\nefficiency etc.\n\n287\n00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.220\nWe'll have a big discussion about\nmetrics a little bit later on as well.\n\n288\n00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.200\nBut you're answering the question\nhere at service design.\n\n289\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.050\nWhat are we gonna measure?\n\n290\n00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.010\nWhat does success look like?\n\n291\n00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.130\nIs the question, and\nyou're gonna measure that success.\n\n292\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.960\nMaking sure you have the right methods\nto collect those measurements is what\n\n293\n00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.880\nservice design is about.\n\n294\n00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.990\nAnd of course processes,\nit's one of the Ps.\n\n295\n00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.090\nAnd it's one of the aspects we\nneed to consider here as well.\n\n296\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:47.510\nAll right.\n\n297\n00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.240\nSo that's some of the generic terminology\nused, associated with Service Design.\n\n298\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.200\nThe key takeaway there is\nthat Service Design package.\n\n299\n00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.270\nThe four Ps and the five aspects.\n\n300\n00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.650\nThose are the key takeaways for\ntest takers out there.\n\n301\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.420\nOkay.\n\n302\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.360\nNow we're going to launch into.\n\n303\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.588\nAn examinations of the eight processes.\n\n304\n00:15:06.588 --> 00:15:09.690\nIn this particular episode,\nwe'll get through four of them and\n\n305\n00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.010\nwe'll work on the other four\nin another episode, okay.\n\n306\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.960\nFirst up is I call it the mother\nhen of service design.\n\n307\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.508\nIs the design coordination process.\n\n308\n00:15:21.508 --> 00:15:27.490\nThe reason why I call it the mother\nhen is making sure that the other\n\n309\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:32.590\nprocesses, all other seven of these\nprocesses are done and done well.\n\n310\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.342\nSo design coordination is shepherding\nall these other processes to\n\n311\n00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:42.067\ncompletion through the service\ndesign life cycle stage.\n\n312\n00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:44.078\nAnd not only shepherding them through,\n\n313\n00:15:44.078 --> 00:15:48.221\nbut making sure that that shepherding is\nefficient, that it's well documented,\n\n314\n00:15:48.221 --> 00:15:52.260\nand can be repeated the next time a\nservice-designed activity comes their way.\n\n315\n00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.230\nIt's also the hand shake\nwith project management.\n\n316\n00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.600\nAgain Itell is not a project\nmanagement discipline,\n\n317\n00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.170\nit's a service management discipline.\n\n318\n00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.369\nIf a project manager, if a pmo,\na project management office,\n\n319\n00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:09.160\nwants to shake hands with itill,\nthis is where it would shake hands with\n\n320\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.213\ndesign coordination I'm sorry,\nwith service design.\n\n321\n00:16:12.213 --> 00:16:14.800\nIt would do so\nthrough the design coordination process.\n\n322\n00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.640\nIf you look at some of\nthe objectives on the screen here,\n\n323\n00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.630\nsome of them actually sound\nlike project management, right?\n\n324\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.510\nCoordinate design activities, right?\n\n325\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.800\nManage overall quality criteria, right?\n\n326\n00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.900\nEnsure appropriate service design\npackages are delivered on time, right?\n\n327\n00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:38.258\nAnd to make sure that these processes are\nreusable and therefore efficient, okay?\n\n328\n00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:45.750\nSo design coordination, is the mother\nhand of all things in service design.\n\n329\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.720\nWhat's out of scope are those things\nthat are in other lifecycle stages like\n\n330\n00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.910\ntransition processes.\n\n331\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.360\nGood news is there's a mother hand\nwaiting in service transition too and\n\n332\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.830\nwe'll talk about that\none a little bit later.\n\n333\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.493\nOkay?\n\n334\n00:16:58.493 --> 00:17:00.260\nAll right.\n\n335\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:00.970\nThat's service design.\n\n336\n00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.180\nService Level Management,\nliving on through these processes.\n\n337\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.140\nAgain, a lot of conceptual things here.\n\n338\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.790\nService Level Management\nis trying to make.\n\n339\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:19.910\nObjective, what business relationship\nmanagement called subjective.\n\n340\n00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.090\nThat's one way to look at it.\n\n341\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:23.150\nSo let's talk about service\nlevel management here.\n\n342\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:33.300\nTo ensure that all current and planned\nIT Services are delivered to a achievable\n\n343\n00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.228\ntargets and what targets means is\nachievable is actually measurable targets.\n\n344\n00:17:37.228 --> 00:17:40.200\nTargets, measurable targets.\n\n345\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.450\nSo as an example, the business\nrelationship manager, we learned about\n\n346\n00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.710\nBRM, business relationship management and\nservice strategy before.\n\n347\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.920\nBusiness relationship management is gonna\ndiscern the high level requirement.\n\n348\n00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.310\nService level requirements such as the\ncustomer may say, I need this service to\n\n349\n00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:02.980\nbe available 24/7, 365 days a year,\n24 hours a day, 7 days a week, right?\n\n350\n00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.780\nNow, that's good,\ngood we have that requirement.\n\n351\n00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.965\nBy the time service level\nmanagement gets here, though, and\n\n352\n00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:13.619\nstarts engaging the customer,\n\n353\n00:18:13.619 --> 00:18:18.580\nthey're gonna try to narrow that down into\nactual deliverable availability targets.\n\n354\n00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:23.940\nYou say you want it 24/7, but can we take\nit down two hours a month for maintenance?\n\n355\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.880\nYeah, yeah you can do that.\n\n356\n00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.000\nHow about two hours a week?\n\n357\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.510\nYeah, sure.\nNo problem.\n\n358\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.040\nBetween 3 and 4AM?\n\n359\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.150\nBetween 3 and 5AM?\n\n360\n00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.680\nYeah those would be good.\n\n361\n00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:38.000\nSo now it is not quite 24/7, it is getting\ninto a very specific targeted measurable.\n\n362\n00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.960\nEvent of availability and making sure\nthat there's ample time for availability.\n\n363\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.520\n>> So you're trying to figure out what\nthe, I guess for, maybe customers the word\n\n364\n00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.280\nI'm looking for, what the customers\nidea of high availability means?\n\n365\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.460\nAnd then working within that constraint.\n\n366\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.570\n>> Exactly and therefore creating\nthe measurable targets against it.\n\n367\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.220\nAnd there's the key thing\nit's gonna be measurable,\n\n368\n00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.930\nit's not gonna be did you like it?\n\n369\n00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.350\nDid you think it was available?\n\n370\n00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.660\nIt's gonna be measured, right?\n\n371\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.780\nSomehow, mythologically,\nit's gonna be done.\n\n372\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.150\n>> If it needs to be up an hour every day,\nthen we have 60 minutes to say, okay, for\n\n373\n00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.710\nthis minute it was up,\nfor that minute it was up.\n\n374\n00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.300\nWell, this minute it was actually down.\n\n375\n00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.720\n>> Right\n>> And we can measure that.\n\n376\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.740\n>> Exactly.\n\n377\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.820\nSo if you're gonna promise something\nSLM's gonna make sure it's measurable.\n\n378\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.090\nThe BRM person is just going to\ngather the high level ones and\n\n379\n00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.370\nthen the service level manager's gonna\nbasically follow up in that discussion and\n\n380\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.280\nget it to very specific\nmeasurable targets.\n\n381\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.905\nRight?\nSo it's negotiating and\n\n382\n00:19:34.905 --> 00:19:38.265\nagreeing to what those targets are,\nwhat those actual targets are?\n\n383\n00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:39.695\nRight?\n\n384\n00:19:39.695 --> 00:19:42.795\nAnd therefore setting the expectations\na little bit different.\n\n385\n00:19:42.795 --> 00:19:45.205\nCuz it may be that it needs to be 24/7,\nand\n\n386\n00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:47.530\nsome services actually\ncan't have any down time.\n\n387\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.110\nSo, you can't take it down\ntwo hours a month, right?\n\n388\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.010\nSome services are like that, so\nwe're more forgivable, right?\n\n389\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.020\n>> I've heard it said we can give\nyou a 24 hours a day 7 days a week,\n\n390\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.988\nzero downtime,\nyou just have to be able to pay for it.\n\n391\n00:19:58.988 --> 00:19:59.635\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n392\n00:19:59.635 --> 00:20:01.130\nabsolutely\n>> Exactly.\n\n393\n00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.900\nAnd that's also part of the back and\nforth.\n\n394\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.320\nMaking sure this is, we can do it.\n\n395\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.960\nBut right?\n\n396\n00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.670\nSo again, service level management's\ngonna be negotiating, what those\n\n397\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.725\nreal measurable targets are in real terms,\nincluding maintenance periods, etc.\n\n398\n00:20:14.725 --> 00:20:16.055\nWhatever the targets might be.\n\n399\n00:20:16.055 --> 00:20:18.627\nThe service does correspond\nwithin five minutes,\n\n400\n00:20:18.627 --> 00:20:20.853\nthey will resolve within two days, right?\n\n401\n00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:23.007\n80% of the tickets will resolve that way,\n\n402\n00:20:23.007 --> 00:20:26.305\nbecause not every incident can be\nresolved just like that, right?\n\n403\n00:20:26.305 --> 00:20:29.395\nSo you come up with some actual\nmeasurable pieces, right?\n\n404\n00:20:30.785 --> 00:20:34.605\nSo Service Level Management does\nnot involve in things like utility,\n\n405\n00:20:34.605 --> 00:20:36.565\nlike the functionality piece.\n\n406\n00:20:36.565 --> 00:20:39.580\nYou don't measure functionality so\nmuch, right?\n\n407\n00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.060\nYou can measure availability.\n\n408\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.520\nYou can measure security incidents.\n\n409\n00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.120\nYou can measure capacity failures,\nor component failures, I should say.\n\n410\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.545\nYou can measure those kind of things, but\nyou can't really measure utility directly.\n\n411\n00:20:51.545 --> 00:20:56.310\nSo, SLM is not really involved\nin the utilitarian parts, okay?\n\n412\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:00.745\nAnd nor the service level management\ndeal with the negotiation of\n\n413\n00:21:00.745 --> 00:21:04.490\ncontracts with third party suppliers,\nit's only for internal organization.\n\n414\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:08.550\nInvolved there negotiating those.\n\n415\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.570\nService level manager\nprocess would also enable\n\n416\n00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.450\nthe ability to have service reviews.\n\n417\n00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.130\nIs it monthly?\n\n418\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:21.179\nHowever periodically it is,\nmonthly, weekly, bi-weekly etc.\n\n419\n00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:24.991\nAnd share those measurable\ntargets at a measurable time.\n\n420\n00:21:24.991 --> 00:21:28.761\n>> Helps keep you on track, if you're\nfalling behind or you're out of the game.\n\n421\n00:21:28.761 --> 00:21:29.700\nGotta know these things.\n\n422\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.600\n>> Exactly.\n\n423\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.360\nThat's right.\nSo\n\n424\n00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.880\nhaving those engagements with\nthe customers gonna be important.\n\n425\n00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.660\nAnd then if you are falling short,\n\n426\n00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.970\nmaking sure you're feeding the improvement\nprocess through Service Improvement Plan.\n\n427\n00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.780\nSo if you're currently not\nmeeting those targets,\n\n428\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.030\nthey would be identified by\nService Level Management.\n\n429\n00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:50.160\nAnd that would also be the point of\ncatalyzing service improvements.\n\n430\n00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.410\nOkay?\nAll right.\n\n431\n00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.850\nLet's pick up some more words here.\n\n432\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.410\nService level requirements.\n\n433\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.630\nAgain these tend to be higher level.\n\n434\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.150\nIt's one of the earliest things\nthat happen in service design.\n\n435\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.310\nVery high level.\n\n436\n00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:07.220\nAnd then you hone in on the details of\nthose two service level managements.\n\n437\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:07.800\nAll right?\n\n438\n00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.810\nAll right.\nService level requirements.\n\n439\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:17.090\nNow, I think we perhaps\nmisuse the term SLA.\n\n440\n00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.770\nYou've probably heard the term before.\n\n441\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.380\n>> Once or twice.\n\n442\n00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.050\n>> Yeah.\n\n443\n00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.860\nI think in practice,\nwe, I won't say misuse.\n\n444\n00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.071\nWe use it differently than ITIL uses it,\nperhaps, right?\n\n445\n00:22:28.071 --> 00:22:32.730\nAs an example, we might say in casual\nconversations with our IT colleagues.\n\n446\n00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.210\nWhat's the SLA for\ninstant resolution time?\n\n447\n00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.760\nAnd really what we're asking is, how much\ntime do we had to resolve it, right?\n\n448\n00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.110\nIs it two days?\n\n449\n00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.630\nIs it two hours, right?\n\n450\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.970\nSo we say what's the SLA,\n\n451\n00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.880\nwhat we're really saying in ITIL terms\nis what's the target, what's the SLT?\n\n452\n00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.680\nReally.\n\n453\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.520\nWhat's the service level target for\nincident resolution time?\n\n454\n00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.940\nAnd then in the purest sense,\nin the ITIL sense,\n\n455\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:05.050\na service level agreement is the agreement\nthat has all the targets inside it, right.\n\n456\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:09.400\nSo if we agree that we're gonna\nresolve incidents within two days,\n\n457\n00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.540\nthat's the target.\n\n458\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.520\nThat target is put into the SLA.\n\n459\n00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.670\nSo the target goes into the agreement,\nright?\n\n460\n00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.780\nI think we kinda conflict those\nsometimes and just say, what's the SLA?\n\n461\n00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.200\nWhen we're really mean\nthe service level target.\n\n462\n00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.610\nIt doesn't matter who's right or\nwrong, in the use of this term, but\n\n463\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.680\nit does matter what ITIL thinks,\nif you wanna pass the exam.\n\n464\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.940\nAnd SLA is an agreement that\nhas targets inside it, so\n\n465\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.620\nlet's keep those concepts straight there.\n\n466\n00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:44.100\nNow a service level agreement, is a very\nspecific type of agreement in ITIL.\n\n467\n00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.890\nIt's the agreement between\nthe service provider and\n\n468\n00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:52.660\nthe IT customer and it's negotiated\nby the service level manager.\n\n469\n00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.950\nThe service level management process.\n\n470\n00:23:54.950 --> 00:24:00.470\nSo an Operational Level Agreement is an\nagreement between the service provider and\n\n471\n00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:04.160\na sibling provider within\nthe same organization.\n\n472\n00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.780\nSo, as example, again, first a SLA between\nthe service provider and the customers.\n\n473\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.890\nSo let say I'm the messaging\nservice provider email.\n\n474\n00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.417\nI have an agreement\nwith the customers that\n\n475\n00:24:16.417 --> 00:24:20.568\nemail will be available 24/7 except for\nmaintenance on Sundays.\n\n476\n00:24:20.568 --> 00:24:24.555\nThe service desk will be\nresponsive within two minutes, and\n\n477\n00:24:24.555 --> 00:24:27.340\nthey'll resolve within two days.\n\n478\n00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.068\nSomething like that.\n\n479\n00:24:28.068 --> 00:24:31.540\nSo I got those targets, and I agree\nto those targets with the customer.\n\n480\n00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.655\nSLA would have that agreement, right?\n\n481\n00:24:34.655 --> 00:24:39.103\nI then turn to my server team and\nhave an OLA with them that says, hey,\n\n482\n00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:44.640\nthese servers need to be available 24/7\nexcept for maintenance on Sundays.\n\n483\n00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.771\nSo I have an operational level agreement\nwith the sibling part of my service\n\n484\n00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:52.837\nprovider that says, I need you to\ndeliver services 24/7, except for\n\n485\n00:24:52.837 --> 00:24:54.233\nmaintenance on Sunday.\n\n486\n00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:58.640\nSo do not think about maintaining\nthose servers on Saturday.\n\n487\n00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.390\nRight, that kind of thing.\n\n488\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.890\nSo I have a separate agreement with them,\nall right?\n\n489\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:07.288\nSo an SLA, agreement between\nthe service provider and the customer.\n\n490\n00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:12.272\nAnd OLA is an agreement between\nthe service provider and\n\n491\n00:25:12.272 --> 00:25:17.795\na supporting service within\nthe same organization, right?\n\n492\n00:25:17.795 --> 00:25:22.712\nNow, an underpinning contract is an\nagreement between the service provider and\n\n493\n00:25:22.712 --> 00:25:27.789\nsome third party outside the organization\nthat helps them to deliver the service.\n\n494\n00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.870\nNow, underpinning contracts are not\nmanaged by service level management.\n\n495\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.300\nThey're listed here because they're\none of the types of agreements, right?\n\n496\n00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.190\nBut it just so happens that\nunderpinning contracts are managed by\n\n497\n00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.220\nsupplier management,\nnot by service level management.\n\n498\n00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.490\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nsupplier management next, okay?\n\n499\n00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:46.650\nAgain, good fodder for\n\n500\n00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:51.090\na test exam question here on all\nthese types of agreements, okay.\n\n501\n00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.976\nNow, how to set up your SLAs in\nterms of the overall framework.\n\n502\n00:25:56.976 --> 00:25:59.294\nAnd there's several methods\nhere that could be, and\n\n503\n00:25:59.294 --> 00:26:02.400\nthey're not mutually exclusive,\nyou could have some sort of hybrid.\n\n504\n00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.110\nThat's what the multilevels about,\nyou see at the bottom there.\n\n505\n00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.850\nSo there's effectively three\ntypes of structures, if you will.\n\n506\n00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:13.340\nThe service-based SLA would be,\nsuch as email.\n\n507\n00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.301\nHere's my service,\nhere's the agreed levels of service,\n\n508\n00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:22.370\nno matter what the customer is,\nno matter who the customer is.\n\n509\n00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.047\nSo it's a service-based SLA.\n\n510\n00:26:25.047 --> 00:26:29.000\nA customer-based SLA would be,\nhere's the customer and\n\n511\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.044\nhere's what we've agreed to\nwith that customer, right.\n\n512\n00:26:33.044 --> 00:26:36.119\nAnd maybe there's several services\nin that particular agreement and\n\n513\n00:26:36.119 --> 00:26:37.169\ntargets within there.\n\n514\n00:26:37.169 --> 00:26:42.087\nAnd then a corporate level SLA\ncould be an SLA that would be kind\n\n515\n00:26:42.087 --> 00:26:45.220\nof like a corporate standard, right?\n\n516\n00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.740\nAnd everyone gets it, regardless of what\ncustomer it is, or what service it is.\n\n517\n00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.790\nRight, so you could have\na customer-based SLA that would\n\n518\n00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.437\nhighlight those things\nthat everyone's gonna do.\n\n519\n00:26:57.437 --> 00:27:02.640\nAnd of course, multi-level is some sort\nof hybrid approach to all those, okay.\n\n520\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.326\nAll right, a good old SLAM chart,\n\n521\n00:27:05.326 --> 00:27:10.860\notherwise known as service level\nagreement monitoring chart.\n\n522\n00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:17.750\nThis is reinforcing the idea that\nvisual graphics, visual representation\n\n523\n00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:22.530\nof your measurements can be more\npowerful than just numbers and letters.\n\n524\n00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.910\nAs an example, in this particular one,\nthere's, say, period one, two, three and\n\n525\n00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.110\nfour is January, February,\nMarch, and April and\n\n526\n00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:34.640\ntarget A is incident resolution time, and\ntarget B is incident response time, and\n\n527\n00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.280\ntarget C is uptime, for instance,\nor availability, right?\n\n528\n00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.391\nAnd then the red, yellow,\nand green is red is bad.\n\n529\n00:27:43.391 --> 00:27:47.000\nYou've gone past the LSLA.\n\n530\n00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.140\nGreen is good.\n\n531\n00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.760\nAnd yellow is, you're really\ngetting close to failure there.\n\n532\n00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.140\nSo it can be a quick way\nto share information.\n\n533\n00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.520\nAs an exam taker,\nyou're not gonna get a lot on this.\n\n534\n00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.900\nYou're not gonna be asked at\nthe foundation level anyway to\n\n535\n00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.015\ninterpret a SLAM chart.\n\n536\n00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:08.980\nKnowing what a SLAM chart is\nthe operative thing here, okay.\n\n537\n00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:10.920\nAll right.\n\n538\n00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:17.660\nThese processes, all these processes\ncan interact with other processes.\n\n539\n00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.120\nService level management has quite a bit\nof interaction with these four processes.\n\n540\n00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.930\nBusiness relationship management,\nas I mentioned before, BRM might be\n\n541\n00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:29.960\ninvolved in discerning the business\nrequirements early, at a high level.\n\n542\n00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.100\nAnd those might morph into\nsystem-level requirements, or,\n\n543\n00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.350\nsorry, service level requirements, right?\n\n544\n00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.989\nSo SLM and BRM,\nservice level management and\n\n545\n00:28:38.989 --> 00:28:43.031\nbusiness relationship management,\nneed to be aware of each other.\n\n546\n00:28:43.031 --> 00:28:47.805\nAnother way to look at this is that if\nbusiness relationship management is making\n\n547\n00:28:47.805 --> 00:28:52.791\nsure that customers are getting what they\nneed and service level management is doing\n\n548\n00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:57.285\nsome measurement that in some regards\napproximates those needs being met,\n\n549\n00:28:57.285 --> 00:29:01.560\nthen obviously they're gonna\nbe related to each other.\n\n550\n00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:06.548\nAnother way to look at that is, I'll just\nask you, is it possible that a service\n\n551\n00:29:06.548 --> 00:29:11.535\nlevel manager could come into a meeting\nwith a customer with all green metrics,\n\n552\n00:29:11.535 --> 00:29:16.770\neverything looks good, and the customer\nstill not be satisfied with the service?\n\n553\n00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:17.800\nIs that possible?\n\n554\n00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:23.350\nRight, so again, it's kind of a rhetorical\nquestion but yes, it is possible.\n\n555\n00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:27.080\nSo SLM and\nBRM need to understand each other and\n\n556\n00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.506\nwork together to make a full picture\nof just what customers are getting.\n\n557\n00:29:31.506 --> 00:29:32.668\nAll right?\n\n558\n00:29:32.668 --> 00:29:38.180\nSupplier management is negotiating\nthose external contracts.\n\n559\n00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.320\nAnd they also need to be working closely\nwith the service level management to\n\n560\n00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.490\nmake sure that the agreements that\nare signed off on with a third party\n\n561\n00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:50.450\nare actually supporting the agreements\nthat you're signing off inside.\n\n562\n00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.514\nAs an example, it would be silly, for\ninstance, for you to have an SLA,\n\n563\n00:29:54.514 --> 00:29:58.448\na service-level agreement,\nnegotiated with a customer that says,\n\n564\n00:29:58.448 --> 00:30:02.315\nI will respond within two days, or\nresolve within two days, and then\n\n565\n00:30:02.315 --> 00:30:07.072\nhave an agreement with a supplier that\nsays, we'll resolve within three, right?\n\n566\n00:30:07.072 --> 00:30:08.260\nYou see how that would be incompatible?\n\n567\n00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.000\nSo they need to be on the same page,\nservice level management,\n\n568\n00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:11.870\nsupplier management.\n\n569\n00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.900\nOf course, service level management\nintegrates with design coordination,\n\n570\n00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.030\nbecause design coordination integrates\nwith the all the processes and\n\n571\n00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.820\nservice design.\n\n572\n00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.080\nIncident management.\n\n573\n00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.170\nCertainly, incident management\ncould be one of the key\n\n574\n00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.030\nprocesses that will end\nup being measured by SLM.\n\n575\n00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.290\nThis is not an exhaustive list either.\n\n576\n00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.840\nAnything can be measured.\n\n577\n00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.630\nThe customer may have a concern\nabout change management, so\n\n578\n00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.060\nyou could measure change management and\nstill be in play that way.\n\n579\n00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:40.770\nAll right.\n\n580\n00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.639\nOne more process, I'm sorry,\nwe've got two more processes.\n\n581\n00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.170\nLet's talk about supplier management and\nservice catalog management.\n\n582\n00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:54.800\nSo, let's leave those for\nthe next episode, and we'll see you soon.\n\n583\n00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.382\n>> Yeah, well.\n\n584\n00:30:56.382 --> 00:30:58.072\nTerry, that was really good stuff.\n\n585\n00:30:58.072 --> 00:31:02.078\nActually I was interested in how you were\ntalking about SLAs, because coming from\n\n586\n00:31:02.078 --> 00:31:05.691\nIT, we think SLAs, I'm thinking\nexactly what you're saying, right?\n\n587\n00:31:05.691 --> 00:31:09.942\nWe don't think of it as being more nuanced\nthan that, as ITIL has broken it down with\n\n588\n00:31:09.942 --> 00:31:13.951\nthe SLTs, which actually makes a whole\nlot more sense when you think about it,\n\n589\n00:31:13.951 --> 00:31:17.560\nbecause you have the overarching\nSLA with the SLTs inside of them.\n\n590\n00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.140\n>> Right.\n>> And that's what we wanna reference, so\n\n591\n00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.880\nI think it's a really good job that they\ndid that, and an excellent job of you of\n\n592\n00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.290\nexplaining it to us, so\nthat we can figure that out, as well.\n\n593\n00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.420\nLooking forward to\nseeing that part two and\n\n594\n00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.270\nfinishing out this life cycle phase here.\n\n595\n00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:34.580\nSo that being said, I will bid\nyou good people a fond farewell.\n\n596\n00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.083\nWe will be signing off for ITProTV.\n\n597\n00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:38.289\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n598\n00:31:38.289 --> 00:31:39.962\n>> Thanks, Terry Decker.\n\n599\n00:31:39.962 --> 00:31:41.393\nSee you next time.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n600\n00:31:41.393 --> 00:31:47.053\n[SOUND]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.560\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.990\nwe are continuing on with\nour ITIL Foundation series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.670\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis our good friend Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n6\n00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.902\nTerry, welcome back sir.\n\n7\n00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:28.136\nGood to have you today, how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:29.000\n>> Good to be here, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.100\nReady to get started here.\n\n10\n00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.430\nWe finished up our last episode with\nhalf way through service design.\n\n11\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.245\nYou'll recall that we did design\ncoordination, service level management.\n\n12\n00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:42.020\nAnd you just look at the slide here,\n\n13\n00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.330\nyou'll see the kind of context\nwhere we're going today.\n\n14\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.100\nAs I've said, we've done design\ncoordination, service level management.\n\n15\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.390\nAnd now to supplier management and\n\n16\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.560\nas you can see, about five more\nprocesses after that in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.650\nSo a lot to learn.\n\n18\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.160\nLet's get started.\n\n19\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.730\nThe primary take away from this, test\ntakers, is for the supplier management.\n\n20\n00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.740\nIts primary purpose is to obtain value for\nmoney, so\n\n21\n00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.400\nyou can highlight those words,\nobtain value for money.\n\n22\n00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.160\nYou'll see it's also one of\nthe objectives, purpose and\n\n23\n00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.380\nobjectives are almost synonymous.\n\n24\n00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.270\nA little acronym check, if you see down\nnear the bottom, we get the supplier and\n\n25\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.250\ncontract management information system,\nthe SCMIS.\n\n26\n00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.260\nA lot of these processes have their own\ninformation systems and this is one for\n\n27\n00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.480\nsupplier management, right?\n\n28\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.410\nSo the scope is supplier management\nis you might imagine is to manage\n\n29\n00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.990\nall suppliers that help a service provider\ndeliver services to their customers.\n\n30\n00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.150\nSo a supplier could be someone\nthat delivers hardware,\n\n31\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.800\ncould be someone that delivers\nsoftware development services.\n\n32\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.880\nAny number of things can\nbe delivered by a supplier.\n\n33\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520\nManaging those contracts,\n\n34\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.550\nmaking sure that the supplier's performing\nup to speed as agreed in the contracts.\n\n35\n00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.785\nRenegotiating those contracts,\npunishing contractors if they don't,\n\n36\n00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:03.677\nrewarding them if they do, etc.\n\n37\n00:02:03.677 --> 00:02:09.792\nThe supplier management process is going\nto be overseeing those activities, right?\n\n38\n00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:12.820\nIncluding the management of any\nsubcontracts that might be in play.\n\n39\n00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:17.650\nAnother key takeaway academically again,\nfor test takers,\n\n40\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.810\nis the supplier management process\nneeds to evaluate a scheme or\n\n41\n00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.780\ncreate a scheme of categorizing suppliers.\n\n42\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.266\nYou can see from the graphic here that,\n\n43\n00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:32.630\njust kind of wanna continue down the lower\nleft, you get commodity suppliers.\n\n44\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.600\nAnd in the upper right,\nyou get the strategic suppliers.\n\n45\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.330\nSo, Daniel, a commodity supplier,\njust as an example would be a perhaps.\n\n46\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.302\nAnd what's gonna happen if someone decides\nthey're not gonna deliver toner cartridge\n\n47\n00:02:46.302 --> 00:02:47.855\nto your company anymore?\n\n48\n00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.140\n>> I'd have a hard time\ngetting those print jobs done.\n\n49\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.512\n>> Yeah, but what are you gonna\ndo to replace that supplier?\n\n50\n00:02:53.512 --> 00:02:55.390\n>> I guess I could search the web for\na competitor.\n\n51\n00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.280\n>> Yeah, or\njust go down the street to staples for\n\n52\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.230\na day until you figure out\nwho the supplier might be.\n\n53\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.940\nSo, it's not that they're that critical.\n\n54\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.670\nI mean you need to print, obviously.\n\n55\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.320\nBut if a supplier of a commodity\n\n56\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.650\ntype supply is delivering\nsomething you can use to replace.\n\n57\n00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.760\n>> There's always somebody else.\n\n58\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.200\n>> Yeah, there's always someone else.\n\n59\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.240\nBut look at the other end of that\ncontinuum, like a strategic supplier.\n\n60\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.168\nWhat would be a strategic supplier for\nperhaps ITProTV,\n\n61\n00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:20.410\nwhat would be a strategic supplier?\n\n62\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.190\nIf they don't succeed,\nyou're not succeeding.\n\n63\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.560\n>> Let's see here,\nprobably our stream provider.\n\n64\n00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.790\n>> There you go, right.\n\n65\n00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.800\nSo that's obviously someone\nyou care a lot about.\n\n66\n00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.120\nThat's not a toner\ncartridge kind of supplier,\n\n67\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.810\nthat's someone that helps you get\nyour job done here at ITProTV.\n\n68\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.500\nSo that's really the kind of\nthis continuum if you will.\n\n69\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.450\nCommodity at one end,\nstrategic suppliers at the other.\n\n70\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.350\nAnd you see, somewhere in\n\n71\n00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.020\nthe middle you've got what's\ncalled tactical suppliers.\n\n72\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.940\nAgain, test takers, this is good\nto understand this continuum or\n\n73\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.760\nthis categorization if you will,\n\n74\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.780\nof suppliers and be able to pick\nthem out on a multiple choice.\n\n75\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.349\nThey'll describe a supplier and you kind\nof put them in the right category, right?\n\n76\n00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.365\nOkay, good.\n\n77\n00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:08.302\nSupplier policy is also another aspect\nof supplier management needs to be\n\n78\n00:04:08.302 --> 00:04:09.790\nconcerned with.\n\n79\n00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.160\nThis often manifests itself in stuff\nlike preferred vendors, right?\n\n80\n00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.840\nSo an organization will setup\n\n81\n00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.640\na shorter list of here's where you can\ngo get this kind of service, right?\n\n82\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.110\nWe get our service from these three\nsuppliers and only these three suppliers.\n\n83\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.680\nOr we get our toner cartridges from\nthese five suppliers and nobody else.\n\n84\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.000\nBut saying that preferred\nvendors could be part of policy.\n\n85\n00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.450\nHow you go about procuring suppliers\ncould also be part of policy,\n\n86\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.088\nthe processes, etc., okay.\n\n87\n00:04:41.088 --> 00:04:43.496\nAll right.\n\n88\n00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:47.310\nNow to the other process\nservice catalog management.\n\n89\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.889\nYou may recall from service strategy\nthat we described the service portfolio.\n\n90\n00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.290\nThe service portfolio had three parts,\n\n91\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.140\nthe pipeline, the service catalog and\nretired services.\n\n92\n00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.430\nSo here we have the middle of those,\nthe service catalog, right?\n\n93\n00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.930\nSo the catalog,\nas being part of the portfolio, is so\n\n94\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.660\nbroad in its scope and it has a lot more\ndetails that need to be ferreted out.\n\n95\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.930\nThat it gets its own process,\n\n96\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.710\nbecause it is such a critical\npart of that portfolio at large.\n\n97\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.870\nService catalog is trying to allow for\n\n98\n00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.270\nproviding all the details of operational\nservices is what the catalog is about.\n\n99\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.590\nAll operational services and all\nthe details and arranging for the proper\n\n100\n00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.720\nviews or the proper audiences to be able\nto see the catalog in meaningful ways.\n\n101\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.190\nSo it has a bit more meat on the bones\nregarding presentation, if you will.\n\n102\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.647\nIt's not just a tool used by IT.\n\n103\n00:05:49.647 --> 00:05:52.086\nThis is the part that's actually\nexposed to customers, so\n\n104\n00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:54.590\nit gets a lot more attention\nhere in service catalog, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.660\nIt could be a simple file.\n\n106\n00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.620\nIt could be a spreadsheet.\n\n107\n00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.900\nIt could be a database.\n\n108\n00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.190\nFor large organizations\nwith lot's of services,\n\n109\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.167\nit could be a relational database, right?\n\n110\n00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.560\nIt could be kind of large, okay.\n\n111\n00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.400\nBut it is intended to show all\nthe details of operational services and\n\n112\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.430\npresent those details to the appropriate\naudience at the right time, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.191\nThese next couple of slides,\nI'm just gonna kind of back and forth for\n\n114\n00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:23.240\na little bit before discussing them.\n\n115\n00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.270\nThis first slide describes\na two view type and\n\n116\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.250\nyou'll see, if I go to the next one right\nquick, it happens to describe three views.\n\n117\n00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.190\nAnd I just want to distinguish\nbetween the top and\n\n118\n00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.850\nthe bottom at first, right, as I go\nbetween these, just back and forth.\n\n119\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.540\nWhat they have in common\nis the top portion\n\n120\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.530\nis what you can conceptualize\nas what customers get to see.\n\n121\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.007\nOn this first example for instance,\nwe got business process 1.\n\n122\n00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:51.680\nLet me go ahead and\nget my pointer up here.\n\n123\n00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.138\nWe got business process 1 here, let's say\nthat business process is communications,\n\n124\n00:06:58.138 --> 00:06:58.660\nall right.\n\n125\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.150\nService A could be telephony,\ntelephone communications.\n\n126\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.000\nService B could be messaging like email.\n\n127\n00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.590\nSo both of these services\nare directly consumed by customers,\n\n128\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.140\nthey use the phone, they use email, right?\n\n129\n00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.190\nBut underneath this little divider,\n\n130\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.360\nthe services underneath this would\nbe things like the server services.\n\n131\n00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.520\nThe database services,\n\n132\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.990\nthe network services,\nthe spaghetti junction if you will.\n\n133\n00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.365\nThe spaghetti junction of what\nIT does in the back end, right?\n\n134\n00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:30.913\nNow customers would be,\n\n135\n00:07:30.913 --> 00:07:35.580\nit could be beneficial to expose\nthis upper portion to customers.\n\n136\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.790\nYou can easily have conversations with\nthem at strategic meetings saying well,\n\n137\n00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.300\nhere's the services we currently offer.\n\n138\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.040\nWe offer email and and\ntelephony for communications.\n\n139\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.773\nWe have this other service to\nsupport financial management,\n\n140\n00:07:47.773 --> 00:07:51.805\nwe have this other one to support\nmanufacturing, etc., right?\n\n141\n00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.852\nAnd that's good for the customers to see.\n\n142\n00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:57.609\nBut they wouldn't really care about\nwhat's underneath the hood here,\n\n143\n00:07:57.609 --> 00:07:59.217\nall this spaghetti junction.\n\n144\n00:07:59.217 --> 00:08:02.907\nSo, service catalog management is\ntrying to manage these different views,\n\n145\n00:08:02.907 --> 00:08:04.070\nif you will.\n\n146\n00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.750\nNow, the next presentation is\njust kinda describing between\n\n147\n00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.400\nthe two different views for\ndifferent customers.\n\n148\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.980\nSo, in this particular example,\n\n149\n00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.740\nthey mention the service catalog for\nwholesale customers versus.\n\n150\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.880\nThe catalog view for retail customers.\n\n151\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.250\nITIL is not prescribing that you have\none view, two views, or three views.\n\n152\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.130\nThey are providing guidance that suggests\nyou should have the appropriate views for\n\n153\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.420\nthe appropriate customers.\n\n154\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.210\nIn my experience for\n\n155\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.650\ninstance at the organization I was\nat we had five business units.\n\n156\n00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.540\nEach business unit had\ntheir own view right.\n\n157\n00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.150\nSo it wasn't two view, it wasn't three\nview, it was five views for customers.\n\n158\n00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.580\nAnd then one view for IT or 17 views for\n\n159\n00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.580\nIT depending on what piece of\nthe catalog they needed to see, right?\n\n160\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.650\nSo again,\n\n161\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.250\nto reinforce what service catalog\nmanagement is trying to make happen.\n\n162\n00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.090\nThey want to get all the details\nabout all these services and\n\n163\n00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.350\nthey want to present\nthem in meaningful ways.\n\n164\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.040\nIn however many ways that takes, if it\ntakes two views, if it takes three views.\n\n165\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.630\nIf it takes 50 views.\n\n166\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.130\nThe service cannot binge through processes\njust trying to make that happen.\n\n167\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.290\n>> Is that typically done as\nsome sort of committee or\n\n168\n00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.560\nmeeting where they come together and\n\n169\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.180\nthen they present this information to\nstakeholders or something in that effect.\n\n170\n00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.910\n>> Yeah.\nIt could be a strategic meetings.\n\n171\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.310\nIt could be during design meetings.\n\n172\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.560\nIt could be even for tactical purposes.\n\n173\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.650\nIt could be meaningful if\nyou're in change management and\n\n174\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.750\nyou wanna see the impact of changing this\nservice or another service system, right?\n\n175\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.220\nSo it could play out in\nlots of different ways.\n\n176\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.210\nAnd that reinforces a good point, Daniel,\nthat while this particular process is born\n\n177\n00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.150\nin service design, it can be used\nby other stages of the life cycle.\n\n178\n00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:48.000\nStrategists could use it,\ncustomers could use it,\n\n179\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.550\nIT could use it,\noperations people could use it etc.\n\n180\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:56.881\nOkay, good, that's service catalog.\n\n181\n00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:03.630\nAll right, now moving on to what we can\nbasically call the warranty processes\n\n182\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:09.060\ncapacity, availability, IT service\ncontinuity, and information security.\n\n183\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.410\nCollectively, these four you can\nrefer to as the warranty processes.\n\n184\n00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.845\nAnd you'll recall warranty is just making\nsure that that the services actually\n\n185\n00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:20.645\navailable for people to use, right?\n\n186\n00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:26.565\nCapacity management itself, it deals with\ntechnical things like disk capacity,\n\n187\n00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:32.460\nCPU capacity,\nit could deal with storage capacity, etc.\n\n188\n00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.470\nSo it certainly deals\nwith component capacity.\n\n189\n00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.680\nBut it has a larger scope than that.\n\n190\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.150\nCertainly talk about the scope it has,\nokay?\n\n191\n00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:49.870\nMoving here the three sub processes of\ncapacity management are component capacity\n\n192\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.800\nmanagement, service capacity management,\nand business capacity management.\n\n193\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.840\nAnd yeah let's talk about\nthese three in term.\n\n194\n00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.500\nI already kind of described\ncomponent capacity that\n\n195\n00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.380\nreally deals with the technology side\nof things Is there enough disk space?\n\n196\n00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.500\nIs there enough CPU?\n\n197\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.720\nIs there enough memory?\n\n198\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.360\nThe technical aspects,\nis there enough bandwidth on the network?\n\n199\n00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.680\nBest capacity of the technology.\n\n200\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.070\nBut service capacity goes\nbeyond the technology, and\n\n201\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.990\nreally kind of talks about actually\nkinda human capacity in many ways.\n\n202\n00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.710\nServer capacity deals with the ability to\nrespond to the demands of the business\n\n203\n00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.440\nwithin the service.\n\n204\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.640\nJust give you an example.\n\n205\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.140\nI managed a learning management system.\n\n206\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.260\nAnd the service around that\nsystem included the ability\n\n207\n00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.450\nto convert instructor led\ntraining to e-learning.\n\n208\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.910\nSo you take a PowerPoint presentation and\nyou make it so it's streaming and\n\n209\n00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.860\naccessible by users, they don't have\nto have an instructor in front of them.\n\n210\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.945\nRight, so that conversion,\nconverting instructor lead training to\n\n211\n00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:59.860\ne-learning became a service that\nthe learning management team provided.\n\n212\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.940\nWe do not have a capacity.\n\n213\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.490\nWe do not anticipate just the flood of\nrequests that the central service would\n\n214\n00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.180\nget for\n\n215\n00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.390\nsuch things so we didn't really manage\nthe to capacity well, right, at first.\n\n216\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.690\nBut we had to create the capacity to\ndeliver this learning management service,\n\n217\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.210\nnot just the learning management system,\nbut\n\n218\n00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:20.680\nthis service of converting instructor\nled raining to e-learning.\n\n219\n00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.940\nSo we developed staff.\n\n220\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.880\nWe hired staff and\n\n221\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.590\nwe made sure that we could answer\nthat call to meet that demand.\n\n222\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.210\nOkay, business capacity is also important.\n\n223\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.560\nI saw a scenario play out one time, and\nit really comes down to business capacity.\n\n224\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.680\nWhere a service had been successfully\nlaunched in several hospitals, right?\n\n225\n00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.550\nBut it failed in one hospital simply\nbecause they didn't train enough\n\n226\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.900\nhospital staff.\n\n227\n00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.430\nTo use this IT service.\n\n228\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.180\nSo there again,\nit was kinda human capacity,\n\n229\n00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.120\nthere wasn't enough capacity\namong the people at the hospital,\n\n230\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.890\nin the business,\nto be able to actually use the service.\n\n231\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.680\nSo, the service wasn't successful.\n\n232\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.570\n>> Terry, I think typically when I use\nthe term capacity, obviously, you know,\n\n233\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.730\nis does my drive have\nthe capacity to hold.\n\n234\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.730\nX amount of data.\n\n235\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:15.970\nWe also tend to use it in the way of,\nI am not a government official.\n\n236\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.040\nI don't work in that capacity.\n\n237\n00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.420\nRight.\n>> Good point.\n\n238\n00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.970\n>> I'm not an elected official.\n\n239\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.380\nAnd I'm not a politician.\n\n240\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.650\n>> Right.\n>> I don't really know a lot about\n\n241\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.290\nthat stuff.\n\n242\n00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.000\n>> Right.\n>> At least the inner workings of it.\n\n243\n00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.260\nAnd so I don't work in that capacity.\n\n244\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.430\nIs that how we're using\ncapacity in this sense?\n\n245\n00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.270\n>> Yes it is because you're talking\n\n246\n00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.420\nabout basically almost\ncapabilities in that case.\n\n247\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.290\n>> Right.\n>> I don't work in that capacity.\n\n248\n00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.300\nSo if you take, again the scenario I\nmentioned where you bring in a new service\n\n249\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.740\nto someone, a you expect them to have\nthe capacity to use the service.\n\n250\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.860\nIf you assume and\nyou assume wrong that service could fail.\n\n251\n00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.240\n>> So we have to poise them to be able\nto actually work in that capacity and\n\n252\n00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.660\nthen\n>> Once they have the ability,\n\n253\n00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.460\nthen you can say our company has\nthe capacity to do X, Y, or Z.\n\n254\n00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.340\n>> There you go, exactly.\n\n255\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.440\nGood point, very good.\n\n256\n00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.440\n>> All right.\n>> So\n\n257\n00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.620\na key component of this understanding\ncapacity then, on the business side,\n\n258\n00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.360\nis understand what's referred to\nas patterns of business activity.\n\n259\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.600\nRight, understanding just what it is,\nand how to manage the capacity.\n\n260\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.180\nFor instance there was a situation where\n\n261\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.400\nour sales people would come and use\nthe learning management system every other\n\n262\n00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.880\nFriday very heavily because they were\nout in the field, then they came back.\n\n263\n00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.350\nThey uploaded training, they took\ntraining, they did various things.\n\n264\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.600\nThat Friday activity,\n\n265\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.500\nthe every other Friday activity, happened\nto coincide with the manufacturing team\n\n266\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.850\ndoing audit reports against the learning\nmanagement system I should say.\n\n267\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.520\nThey were trying to get\ntraining records audited.\n\n268\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.580\nAnd they would do that every Friday.\n\n269\n00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:50.680\nSo every other Friday we would have one\ndepartment heavily using the system,\n\n270\n00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.440\nand another department\nheavily using the system.\n\n271\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.990\nAnd we have problems\non every other Friday.\n\n272\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.290\nOur performance would degrade.\n\n273\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.820\nOur service was not as effective, right?\n\n274\n00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.860\nAnd it sounds simple now because\nwe now know the research, but\n\n275\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.870\nwe didn't really understand at first\nFirst what was going on with on Fridays,\n\n276\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.950\nevery other Fridays, so we figured it out.\n\n277\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.710\nOverall we eventually figured out that\nit's because the sales people are coming\n\n278\n00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:15.550\nin every other Friday and\n\n279\n00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.470\nthe manufacturing team was\nusing it heavily on Fridays.\n\n280\n00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.510\nHad we anticipated that?\n\n281\n00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.220\nHad we understood that before.\n\n282\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.030\nIf we understood the patterns\nof business activity\n\n283\n00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.500\nbefore we launched our\nlearning management service,\n\n284\n00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.300\nwe would have been more successful at\ndelivering on the capacity end of.\n\n285\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.950\nAnd maybe ask the manufacturing team\nto do the audit reports on Monday.\n\n286\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.810\nWhich wouldn't have affected\nthe sales team at all, right?\n\n287\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:42.363\nSo understanding patterns of business\nactivity can help you prepare for\n\n288\n00:15:42.363 --> 00:15:46.406\nthe capacity management questions\nyou might be facing, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:46.406 --> 00:15:51.977\nAll right,\nnow on to availability management.\n\n290\n00:15:51.977 --> 00:15:56.853\nIn its simplest terms availability\nmanagement as a process is trying to\n\n291\n00:15:56.853 --> 00:16:00.604\nenable the service to be\navailable as agreed, right?\n\n292\n00:16:00.604 --> 00:16:02.435\nIt just makes sense, so\n\n293\n00:16:02.435 --> 00:16:07.473\nif you promised that this service\nshould be available 24/7,\n\n294\n00:16:07.473 --> 00:16:14.130\n\\nine to five, five days a week,\nthen make sure that service is available.\n\n295\n00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:22.240\nIt includes component availability,\nas well as service availability.\n\n296\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.720\nSo, Daniel, I ask you, is it possible for\na component to fail and\n\n297\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.012\nthe service still be available?\n\n298\n00:16:29.012 --> 00:16:31.960\n>> I would assume that there\nare situations where that is possible.\n\n299\n00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.960\n>> Yeah, for sure,\nyou have redundant servers or\n\n300\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.920\nyou have redundant\nswitches in the network.\n\n301\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.390\nYou built in continuity\nwhich we'll talk about soon.\n\n302\n00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.230\nIt's possible for components to fail and\nthe service still be available.\n\n303\n00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.070\nThat's one way to understand the\ndifference between service availability\n\n304\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.860\nand component availability.\n\n305\n00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.560\nAnother way to consider that is if\nit is a service intensively using\n\n306\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.980\nIT people as opposed to IT systems,\nthen are those people available?\n\n307\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.080\nDealing with capacity probably\nhere in this case too,\n\n308\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.000\nso they're related,\nthese things are related.\n\n309\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:09.380\nThis idea of reactive versus proactive,\nI wanna hone in on this.\n\n310\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.790\nIt could be critical to success on two or\nthree questions on the exam, potentially.\n\n311\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.260\nMonitoring, if you look here at the box,\n\n312\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.410\nyou'll see the monitoring is\nconsidered a reactive activity.\n\n313\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.810\nNow, you get a lot of push back.\n\n314\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.190\nWhen I teach this class in live\nenvironments, I get good arguments.\n\n315\n00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.530\nAnd it's hard for me to counter\nthese arguments to be quite honest,\n\n316\n00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.950\njust to give you an example.\n\n317\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:40.120\nI think most students can realize\nthat monitoring feels proactive\n\n318\n00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.570\nif you're monitoring something and\nyou see it starting to fall over.\n\n319\n00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.110\nYou get in front of it\nbefore it falls over.\n\n320\n00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.800\nThat kind of sounds proactive, doesn't it?\n\n321\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.668\nSo I get that understanding.\n\n322\n00:17:50.668 --> 00:17:55.560\nBut what ITIL's trying to teach here and\nit makes sense is that if you wait for\n\n323\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.600\nmonitors to tell you that you have\na bad architecture for instance.\n\n324\n00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.050\nAnd it's regularly going down and\nyou have to prop it up, right?\n\n325\n00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.740\nThat's really being reactive.\n\n326\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.650\nIf you have tested designs,\ntested architecture,\n\n327\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:13.060\nyou've done performance tests on your\narchitecture and you know what works.\n\n328\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.900\nThat's considered the proactive\naspect of availability management.\n\n329\n00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:21.396\nSo really what ITIL is trying to do is\ndistinguish that you need to have this\n\n330\n00:18:21.396 --> 00:18:27.110\ndiscipline of understanding architectures\nand how they relate to availability.\n\n331\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:31.390\nAnd intelligently choose the appropriate\narchitecture and not just wait for\n\n332\n00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:35.686\na monitor in the live environment to tell\nyou that it might be a house of cards,\n\n333\n00:18:35.686 --> 00:18:36.330\nokay?\n\n334\n00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:42.200\nSo again, to reinforce is monitoring\na proactive or a reactive activity?\n\n335\n00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.390\nTest takers, it is reactive.\n\n336\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.750\n>> It would seem that that's logical too\nbecause if I'm monitoring something,\n\n337\n00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.950\nif the monitor has gone off and\n\n338\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.160\nthe activity has already\noccurred to trigger the monitor.\n\n339\n00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.260\nIt already has to have happened,\nnow it might not be a severe activity.\n\n340\n00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.490\nWhere I can jump in and\n\n341\n00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:02.000\nsay I need to take care of this before\nthe house of cards comes tumbling down.\n\n342\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.480\nAnd then still I'm reacting to it.\n\n343\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.610\n>> That's right.\n\n344\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.814\nYep, very good.\n\n345\n00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.512\nAll right, now let's give in some\nnuance about this availability,\n\n346\n00:19:10.512 --> 00:19:12.600\nsome aspects of availability.\n\n347\n00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.330\nFunny enough,\navailability is an aspect of availability.\n\n348\n00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.770\nIf you can see on the first list here,\njust to cross you up with some words.\n\n349\n00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:24.150\nReally what we're talking about is\nways to measure availability for\n\n350\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.170\none and also nuances in that.\n\n351\n00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.500\nSo availability,\njust to give you an example of this.\n\n352\n00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:35.970\nAvailability in its raw sense is, is\nthe service available at the agreed times.\n\n353\n00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.910\nSo work with me on the math\nhere a little bit.\n\n354\n00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.894\nIf you've promised that the service is\ngonna be available Monday through Friday,\n\n355\n00:19:43.894 --> 00:19:47.330\nnine to five, that's 40 hours, okay.\n\n356\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.080\nIf during that week,\nMonday through Friday, nine to five, and\n\n357\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.320\nduring those times you\nhave four hours of outage.\n\n358\n00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.410\nSo that's four hours out\nof the 40 you promised.\n\n359\n00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:02.850\nThen your availability that week is 90%,\nas simple as that, right?\n\n360\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.460\nSo availability is measured in the percent\nof time you've promised to be available\n\n361\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.850\nthat you're actually available.\n\n362\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.500\nThat's how availability is measured.\n\n363\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.580\nNow reliability gives\nyou some nuance to that.\n\n364\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:20.540\nReliability is the measure of how long a\nservice will perform without going down or\n\n365\n00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.020\nwithout interruption.\n\n366\n00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.710\nSo let's say that was one\nfour hour outage, right?\n\n367\n00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:30.560\nSo your reliability would be pretty good,\nyou only had one outage that week, right?\n\n368\n00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.810\nBut it took four hours to recover, so\nthat's where maintainability comes in.\n\n369\n00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.770\nMaintainability is the measure\nof how quickly a service or\n\n370\n00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.650\na component can be restored.\n\n371\n00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:41.600\nHow quickly it comes back.\n\n372\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.700\nSo let's use some egregious examples.\n\n373\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.020\nIf you had one outage this year,\n\n374\n00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:53.090\nall year you had one outage, then your\nreliability is really good, right?\n\n375\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:57.550\nBut if maintainability, if that outage\ncost, if that outage lasted two and\n\n376\n00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.580\na half days, then ouch.\n\n377\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.580\nYou were really out of service for\ntwo and a half days.\n\n378\n00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.840\nConsider how mad you would be\nat your cable TV provider or\n\n379\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.600\nyour ATM at the bank if they were down for\ntwo and half days.\n\n380\n00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.630\n>> That is unacceptable [LAUGH].\n\n381\n00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.470\n>> Right, it's unacceptable, that's right.\n\n382\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.450\nSo, they only had one outage.\n\n383\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.200\nSo you see how reliability and\n\n384\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.460\nmaintainability give you a little nuance\ninto this discussion of availability.\n\n385\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.952\nSo taken together, those three aspects\nof availability can give you kind\n\n386\n00:21:24.952 --> 00:21:29.460\nof a fuller picture of just\nhow stable your system is.\n\n387\n00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.370\nWorth memorizing here is not only the\nconcepts of availability, reliability and\n\n388\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.770\nmaintainability, but\ntheir measurements, right?\n\n389\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.870\nSo you've got expressed as\na percentage for availability,\n\n390\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:43.840\nmean time between failures is\nthe measurement for reliability.\n\n391\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:50.950\nAnd mean time to restore service is\nthe measure for maintainability, okay?\n\n392\n00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:55.025\nIf you outsource a service, you mentioned\nyour streaming provider earlier, Daniel.\n\n393\n00:21:55.025 --> 00:21:56.360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n394\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.970\n>> What you refer to as their ability to\nmeet their agreed terms of availability,\n\n395\n00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.710\nyou call it service ability.\n\n396\n00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.990\nSo service ability applies or\nentails all of the above, availability,\n\n397\n00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:12.885\nreliability and maintainability,\nas it relates to a third party supplier.\n\n398\n00:22:12.885 --> 00:22:13.640\n>> Okay.\n\n399\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.140\n>> Okay.\n\n400\n00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.640\nVital Business Functions.\n\n401\n00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.560\nUnderstanding what's really vital\nabout what the business is trying to\n\n402\n00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.350\ndo is going to help you understand how\navailable this system needs to be.\n\n403\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.970\nI can kind of maybe give you an egregious\nexample of where this wasn't\n\n404\n00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.280\ndone effectively, or\ndo a compare and contrast.\n\n405\n00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.250\nLet's say there's an IT system that\nmonitors the heart rate of ICU patients.\n\n406\n00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:46.670\nWould you need to consider that\nparticular system to be highly available?\n\n407\n00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.780\n>> Yeah, probably a good idea.\n\n408\n00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.150\n>> Right, we're talking about life and\nlimb, right?\n\n409\n00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.840\nSo, there's probably a lot of redundancy\nbuilt in it, a lot of continuity.\n\n410\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.610\nWe'll talk about that next.\n\n411\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.730\nThere's probably a lot of continuity\nbuilt in those kinds of IT services that\n\n412\n00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.230\nactually monitor life and\nlimb type aspects.\n\n413\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.320\nPerhaps for an organization the control\nsystems on a manufacturing floor.\n\n414\n00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.660\nYou remember Lucy and the bonbons?\n\n415\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.840\nThat little funny Lucille Ball,\n\n416\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.610\nwhere the candy's going down the conveyor\nbelt and she can't get them [INAUDIBLE].\n\n417\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:20.320\nImagine if that was an IT system,\nmanaging the bonbons, if you will.\n\n418\n00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.490\nWhat if a manufacturing company's\nconcerned about a runaway conveyor belt.\n\n419\n00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.290\nThat also might be something\nyou might consider.\n\n420\n00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.190\nWell, we gotta monitor\nthat very effectively and\n\n421\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.070\nmake sure there's not a failure\nin the bonbon machine.\n\n422\n00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.180\nOr else you'll end up\nwith bonbons everywhere.\n\n423\n00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.080\nSo understanding what's vital to the\nbusiness is going to help you understand\n\n424\n00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.710\nthe availability equation and\njust what you need to build out.\n\n425\n00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.727\nAnd I'll give you an example,\nperhaps on the bad side of things or\n\n426\n00:23:45.727 --> 00:23:48.366\nif you over-engineer for availability.\n\n427\n00:23:48.366 --> 00:23:52.654\nWould you suggest that\na learning management system,\n\n428\n00:23:52.654 --> 00:23:58.245\na system that allows a company or\nemployees to take Training online is so\n\n429\n00:23:58.245 --> 00:24:03.170\nvital it needs to be available 24/7,\n365 days a year.\n\n430\n00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.090\n>> It depend on your perspective.\n\n431\n00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.480\nIf it's your business, yeah, you think-\n>> So maybe so.\n\n432\n00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.440\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you're making\n\n433\n00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.520\n>> Making money doing this?\n\n434\n00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.380\nExactly, right.\n\n435\n00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.550\nSo you see how vitality for\none may not be vitality for another.\n\n436\n00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.770\nSo understanding the vital business\nfunctions is gonna be key to answering\n\n437\n00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.730\nthe question, how available must we be?\n\n438\n00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.779\nRight.\nIt helps you have that conversation.\n\n439\n00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.520\nAll right, moving on to continuity.\n\n440\n00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.940\nWe've kinda referred to it off and\non as we've gone through here.\n\n441\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.830\nIT service continuity\nmanagement is making sure that\n\n442\n00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:39.030\nin the event of a failure\nyou can still be resilient.\n\n443\n00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.800\nSome sort of service failure or\n\n444\n00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.600\ncomponent failure where you can\nstill have an available service.\n\n445\n00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.120\nI mentioned earlier,\nif a server fails, is it possible for\n\n446\n00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.470\nthe service to still be up and\nthe answer which yes, that's possible.\n\n447\n00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.190\nIf one component fails,\nthe service would still be up.\n\n448\n00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:00.150\nThat's effectively continuity management\nat the component level, right?\n\n449\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.150\nBut I want to broaden the idea\nof continuity management,\n\n450\n00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.570\nbecause it goes beyond just components,\nright?\n\n451\n00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.740\nContinuity could deal with,\nwhat the business is trying to get done?\n\n452\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.060\nWhat are the business continuity\nmanagement plans might be?\n\n453\n00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.770\nSo, understanding business impact\nanalysis, if something were to fail.\n\n454\n00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.040\nHow resilient must we be?\n\n455\n00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.190\nThe hospital heart monitor,\nas we just mentioned.\n\n456\n00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:25.570\nYou're probably gonna build lots of\ncontinuity into that type of IT service,\n\n457\n00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.710\nIT system, to make sure that if it\nfalls over, there's something else.\n\n458\n00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:33.650\nA power supply, a different heart monitor,\nor whatever it might be.\n\n459\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.040\nSo the understanding of the impact\n\n460\n00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.095\nis gonna be critical than understanding\nhow you design for continuity?\n\n461\n00:25:39.095 --> 00:25:42.230\nOkay?\n\n462\n00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:48.060\nSome other ideas to focus on here is that\nthe IT service continuity management\n\n463\n00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:53.280\nplan needs to match up with what the\nbusiness continuity management plan is.\n\n464\n00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.000\nJust as an example, if you're\na manufacturing company, and you have IT\n\n465\n00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.760\nsystems supporting or IT services\nsupporting the manufacturing company.\n\n466\n00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.720\nAnd the Business Continuity Management\nPlan is written down and says that,\n\n467\n00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.020\nif we lose this manufacturing\nplant due to tornado.\n\n468\n00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:15.100\nHow are we going to recoup\nproduction if that happens?\n\n469\n00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.710\nSo, the businesses started\nthinking about it.\n\n470\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.230\nIf we lose that manufacturing capacity.\n\n471\n00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.640\nHow are we going to\npick it somewhere else?\n\n472\n00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.130\nSo, the business is thinking about it.\n\n473\n00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.540\nWhat would IT's response\nbe to that eventuality?\n\n474\n00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.840\nWould be what IT needs to think about.\n\n475\n00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.690\nAnd maybe there needs to be more network\nroutes at these three other plants,\n\n476\n00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.740\nor more systems put in, right?\n\n477\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.590\nMaybe they got to go in and retrofit,\nIT has to go in and retrofit some IT\n\n478\n00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:44.100\nsystems to support the services with this\nnew production in these other plants.\n\n479\n00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.040\nThat sort of thing.\n\n480\n00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.340\nSo the tail wagging the dog, so to speak,\n\n481\n00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.420\nit's not IT describing for\nthe business what continuity means,\n\n482\n00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:57.370\nit's the business describing to IT what\ncontinuity means and making sure you\n\n483\n00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.470\nbuild those resistant, this built in\nresilience as you go through there.\n\n484\n00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.900\nSo it can for the mundane.\n\n485\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.990\nA switch fails, there's another\none there to take care of it.\n\n486\n00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.560\nYou've got hot swappable spares\nin the data center, right.\n\n487\n00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:19.120\nDisk storage is often resilient with\nvarious types of fault tolerance in there.\n\n488\n00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:25.640\nIf a disk fails there's still capabilities\nto store data, etc, and to retrieve data.\n\n489\n00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.500\nSo it happens at the component level, but\n\n490\n00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.500\nit also happens at a larger level,\nall right?\n\n491\n00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.670\nSo disaster recovery, it could be for\nbig things like bombs and\n\n492\n00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.020\ntornadoes and fires etc.\n\n493\n00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.290\nOkay?\n\n494\n00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:43.590\nSo, Continuity Management and the next one\nwe'll talk about is Security Management.\n\n495\n00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:48.300\nThose two processes have as their\nfocus the what if questions.\n\n496\n00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.960\nSo, they are effectively risk focused.\n\n497\n00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.530\nThey are certainly asking the question,\nwhat if this happens?\n\n498\n00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:56.760\nThose continuity management and\n\n499\n00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.220\nsecurity management are have a laser\nbeam focus on those what if questions.\n\n500\n00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.240\nSo they risk management and\nrisk mitigation processes, okay?\n\n501\n00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.820\nAgain as we mentioned before,\nbusiness impact analysis.\n\n502\n00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:15.410\nThe impact of a heart monitor\ngoing down versus the impact of\n\n503\n00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.400\na learning management system going down.\n\n504\n00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.200\nYou look at the business impact, what's\nvital and how it's going to be affected?\n\n505\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.830\nIt's going to inform your\ncontinuity planning as well.\n\n506\n00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.680\nIs it financial?\n\n507\n00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.630\nIs it safety, loss of life or limb?\n\n508\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.580\nIs it reputation?\n\n509\n00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.480\nIs it regulatory risk, right?\n\n510\n00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.680\nIf you don't do this right, you could\nget fined by the federal government.\n\n511\n00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.610\nAll those factors play into\nthe business impact analysis and\n\n512\n00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.860\nwhat has to be maintained for continuity.\n\n513\n00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.660\nOkay, and then finishing up\non our warranty processes.\n\n514\n00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.610\nAgain, the warranty processes\nare capacity, availability and\n\n515\n00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:53.050\nIT Service Continuity, and\nwe'll talk about Information Security.\n\n516\n00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:58.920\nMost students find this fairly intuitive,\nbecause as IT participants,\n\n517\n00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:05.660\nas IT users, we often are involved\nin security measures.\n\n518\n00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.320\nDo you change your password?\n\n519\n00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.540\nDoes it have to be complex, right?\n\n520\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.620\nAre you supposed log off your computer\nbefore you step away from it?\n\n521\n00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.950\nAll those types of things, right?\n\n522\n00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.982\nSo that is really what security management\nis about, allowing for the right people to\n\n523\n00:29:17.982 --> 00:29:21.185\nhave access to the information and\nthe wrong people not getting it.\n\n524\n00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:25.003\nSo there's some key words here that\nyou can see under the objectives that\n\n525\n00:29:25.003 --> 00:29:26.680\nare worth looking at.\n\n526\n00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.480\nWe have confidentiality, which is\n\n527\n00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.250\nonly the right people get to see the\ninformation and the wrong people don't.\n\n528\n00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.040\nIntegrity, where data and\n\n529\n00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.899\ninformation is not altered\neither in transit or in storage.\n\n530\n00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.850\nSo it's got integrity, it's not violated\nby viruses or corrupted by viruses,\n\n531\n00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.630\netc., right?\n\n532\n00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:52.790\nAnd making sure that you can respond to\ndenial of service attacks that you're\n\n533\n00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.980\nnetwork's not being flooded with so\n\n534\n00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:58.005\nmuch traffic from an attack\nthat you can't function, right?\n\n535\n00:29:58.005 --> 00:30:02.035\nSo, firewall protections and those type\nof things as part of security management.\n\n536\n00:30:02.035 --> 00:30:05.895\nAnd then authenticity is the person you\n\n537\n00:30:05.895 --> 00:30:10.340\nthink you're speaking to is authenticated\nto be the person you're speaking to.\n\n538\n00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.580\nA classic example of this is\ne-commerce through the internet.\n\n539\n00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:19.530\nIf you're going to Amazon.com and you're\nputting your credit card information in,\n\n540\n00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:25.230\nyou have reasonable assurances that your\ncredit card is going to Amazon.com and\n\n541\n00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:28.480\nnot to just somebody fishing around for\ncredit cards.\n\n542\n00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.000\nBecause of the security built\ninto those types of transactions.\n\n543\n00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.110\nThat's authenticity right?\n\n544\n00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:41.650\nAnd non repudiation basically it is who\nyou say you are and can't be reputed.\n\n545\n00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:44.210\nAll right.\n\n546\n00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.340\nInformation security management wants to\nensure that there's policies in place\n\n547\n00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.640\nto make the environment secure.\n\n548\n00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.600\nSo if you consider as an example,\nyou change your passwords periodically,\n\n549\n00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.900\nhow often do you change your passwords,\nDaniel?\n\n550\n00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.260\n>> How often do I change my passwords?\n\n551\n00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.355\nIt's very not often for me.\n\n552\n00:31:04.355 --> 00:31:05.230\n[CROSSTALK] A very unsecure.\n\n553\n00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.740\n>> I mean you're unsecure.\n\n554\n00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.560\n>> I wouldn't say that.\n\n555\n00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.445\n>> Yeah you're unsecure.\n\n556\n00:31:08.445 --> 00:31:11.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> I wouldn't say that, cuz I counteract\n\n557\n00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:16.840\nthe need to change passwords often\nby using uncrackable passwords.\n\n558\n00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.660\n>> So very complex passwords?\n\n559\n00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.220\n>> Understood.\n\n560\n00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.840\nSo appreciate that.\n\n561\n00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.530\nSecurity policy in our organization for\n\n562\n00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.740\nan IT person would say this\nis how we're gonna do it.\n\n563\n00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.360\nIt's gonna be a really complex password\nyou don't have to change it very often or\n\n564\n00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.230\nyou're gonna change them off and\nit's gonna be complex right?\n\n565\n00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.320\nThose kinds of things.\n\n566\n00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.620\nPolicy would make those things happen.\n\n567\n00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.208\nPolicy would also dictate just how we go\nabout the process of granting access to\n\n568\n00:31:39.208 --> 00:31:41.742\ndata right?\n\n569\n00:31:41.742 --> 00:31:44.890\nSo, remember the example earlier\nwhere I called the service desk and\n\n570\n00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.720\nasked for permissions to the HR database.\n\n571\n00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.140\nThe service desk would probably\nsay well that's not how we do it.\n\n572\n00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.370\nYou don't call the service desk.\n\n573\n00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:55.430\nWe need to get a formal request\nfrom the HR director that goes\n\n574\n00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.670\nto the appropriate channels and\ngets you the right approvals, right?\n\n575\n00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:02.850\nThat policy, security policy would dictate\njust how that's supposed to happen, okay?\n\n576\n00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:06.050\nWho should have access to the policy?\n\n577\n00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.510\nIs it something you hide from people?\n\n578\n00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.770\nNo you make the policy well known.\n\n579\n00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.940\n>> Yeah it would make sense to say\neveryone needs to know what our security\n\n580\n00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.590\npolicy is therefore you know,\nif you violate it we can come and\n\n581\n00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.370\nsmack you on the hand.\n\n582\n00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.820\n>> Exactly, good point exactly.\n\n583\n00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:24.840\nAnd so that you can actually not only\nenforce it with the slapping of hands,\n\n584\n00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.870\nbut so people know how it's\nsupposed to work right they're not\n\n585\n00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.220\nblind sided by all right.\n\n586\n00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.690\nAll right.\n\n587\n00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:32.280\nThat's it for\n\n588\n00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.800\nservice design we covered quite a bit of\ninformation across two parts, we have\n\n589\n00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.660\nthree more lifecycles to go and we'll\npick up those up in a other episodes.\n\n590\n00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.260\n>> All right Terry well\ngreat stuff though.\n\n591\n00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.330\nThanks for walking us through that.\n\n592\n00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.260\nIt's obviously information\nwe're gonna need and\n\n593\n00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.200\nvery pertinent to us as IT individuals.\n\n594\n00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.880\nMaybe you're in management,\nmaybe you're just in IT yourself.\n\n595\n00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.320\nThis is all relevant stuff for\nanyone that touches a Computer or\n\n596\n00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.400\nsome sort of IT system.\n\n597\n00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:57.990\nVery good stuff.\n\n598\n00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.190\nTerry, you did a great job.\n\n599\n00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.890\nWe appreciate you.\n\n600\n00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:04.000\nWe appreciate you guys joining us today,\nbut it looks like our time has expired.\n\n601\n00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.440\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n602\n00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.805\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n603\n00:33:08.805 --> 00:33:09.495\nAnd I'm Terry Decker.\n\n604\n00:33:09.495 --> 00:33:10.189\nSee you next time.\n\n605\n00:33:10.189 --> 00:33:10.960\n>> See you next time.\n\n606\n00:33:10.960 -->

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:19.191\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\ntoday's episode well,\n\n5\n00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:22.265\nwe're moving forward with more\non our ITIL Foundation series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:24.791\nJoining us in the studio\ntoday is our good friend.\n\n7\n00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:28.280\nThe guy that's been helping us out with\nthis all along and we'll continue to do so\n\n8\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.044\nuntil we're done or until I let him out.\n\n9\n00:00:30.044 --> 00:00:32.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.810\nTerry, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.360\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.540\n>> I'm feeling like a prisoner.\n\n13\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.253\nNo, I'm okay.\n\n14\n00:00:36.253 --> 00:00:36.890\n>> Help me.\n\n15\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.050\n>> Yeah, help me [LAUGH].\n\n16\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.820\nGlad to be here again.\n\n17\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.622\nJust to recap where we've been,\nwe've been in service strategy for\n\n18\n00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:48.590\na bit, which is deciding what\nservices should be offered.\n\n19\n00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.850\nAnd then we went to service design and\n\n20\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.830\nanswered all the questions about what's\ngonna make that service possible.\n\n21\n00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.240\nAnd came up with the service design\npackage and that service design package\n\n22\n00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.710\nis then passed down to service transition\nwith all those questions answered.\n\n23\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.544\nAnd then service transition makes\nit come to life and then eventually\n\n24\n00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:12.830\nwe'll pass it on into operations, so we'll\nfocus on service transition right now.\n\n25\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.080\nIf you look at the slide here,\nyou'll see that as we've done before,\n\n26\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.060\nwe'll talk about the big picture\nof service transition and\n\n27\n00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.490\npick up some good vocabulary as\nwe always have to with ITIL.\n\n28\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.430\nGo learn some words, configuration,\n\n29\n00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.260\nitems, CMS, Definitive Media Library,\nchange types.\n\n30\n00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.290\nAnd then we will survey the five\nprocesses that are in scope for\n\n31\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.910\nthe foundation curriculum.\n\n32\n00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.223\nTransition planning and\nsupport, service asset,\n\n33\n00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:45.826\nconfiguration management, knowledge\nmanagement is actually gonna be in there.\n\n34\n00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:47.950\nAnd then we will go into\nanother episode and\n\n35\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.500\npick up change management released\nin deployment management, okay.\n\n36\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.230\nAll right, so the purpose of service\ntransition is to make sure that\n\n37\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.305\nthe modification or\nthe introduction of new services.\n\n38\n00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:06.600\nChanged services or new services, or\nretired services, are managed effectively\n\n39\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.570\nwith the least amount of impact as\npossible on the customers, right?\n\n40\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.510\nSo while service design\nwas dealing with new and\n\n41\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.000\nchanged services,\nservice transition is new and changed and\n\n42\n00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.850\nretiring services is added to the scope,\nokay.\n\n43\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.120\nSpeaking of retired services,\n\n44\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.040\nhave you ever considered,\nI know I haven't, some of my past.\n\n45\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.030\nWe thought about turning off a server but\n\n46\n00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.260\nwe weren't really sure if\npeople were still using it.\n\n47\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.570\nSo we just thought well, we'll just\nturn it off and see if anyone screams.\n\n48\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.383\nWell, ITIL has a little bit different\napproach to retiring things [LAUGH].\n\n49\n00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:42.764\n>> The official way to\naccess these things?\n\n50\n00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:43.290\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly, right.\n\n51\n00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.400\nSo service transition is trying to provide\n\n52\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.140\nthe structure by which services\ncan be peacefully retired and\n\n53\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.700\nknowingly retired as well as\nmanaging new and changed services.\n\n54\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.101\nSo that's the scope, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:59.953\nAs you can see here,\ntransition of new and changed services,\n\n56\n00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:03.970\nas well as the transfer of services\namong different providers.\n\n57\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.080\nSo perhaps you take a service\nthat's in house and outsource it or\n\n58\n00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.630\nperhaps you take something that's\noutsourced and bring it back in or\n\n59\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.840\nperhaps you have moving from\none supplier to another.\n\n60\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.110\nTransition management, all right,\nI'm sorry, service transition\n\n61\n00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.420\nis going to be there to make sure all\nthat happens in a peaceful way, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.160\nSo, what you're trying to do in terms\nof delivering value at this stage\n\n63\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.870\nis to make sure you do cause no harm.\n\n64\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.744\nKind of like the Hippocratic\noath of the doctor's take-\n\n65\n00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.666\n>> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n66\n00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:36.788\n>> Yeah,\nis the first thing is do no harm, right?\n\n67\n00:03:36.788 --> 00:03:41.320\nSo certainly is transition is trying to\nminimize the impact of this change or\n\n68\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.740\nthis new service coming into being or\nin fact, retiring services\n\n69\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.379\n>> That's funny,\n\n70\n00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.571\nthat's always the Hippocratic\noath is do no harm right,\n\n71\n00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:50.095\nthe worse thing I always tell a doctor\nwhen I go into the office is.\n\n72\n00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:51.229\nWe're not gonna hurt each other, are we?\n\n73\n00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:56.057\n>> [LAUGH] And\nhe's pretty intimidated by that point.\n\n74\n00:03:56.057 --> 00:03:59.290\n[LAUGH] Do you bring weapons with you?\n\n75\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.655\n>> I said I don't need them.\n\n76\n00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:02.660\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n77\n00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.710\nAs with the services\ndesign life cycle stage,\n\n78\n00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.060\nthe processes need to be done effectively,\nefficiently, cost effectively.\n\n79\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.640\nSo in service transition, you don't wanna\nhave to reinvent the wheel every time, so\n\n80\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.480\nyou get good at these processes.\n\n81\n00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.250\nYou standardize them, you get it,\nso you can kind of turn the crank.\n\n82\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.300\nAnd be so efficient at this at all\nthese different processes that\n\n83\n00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.940\nit is cost effective and very efficient.\n\n84\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.613\nAnd therefore, you can bring on more work\nbecause you've managed to standardize\n\n85\n00:04:31.613 --> 00:04:33.994\nthese processes going through, right?\n\n86\n00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:37.710\nSo that's what you see in this\nlong bulleted list here is about\n\n87\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.360\nreusing resources.\n\n88\n00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.960\nUse those assets more often.\n\n89\n00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.480\nBe faster, decrease delays.\n\n90\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.680\nSo your throughput becomes more, you can\nbe more responsive to the business needs.\n\n91\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.710\nAs the business continues to change,\nyou're able to introduce services and\n\n92\n00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.109\nprocesses in an efficient manner, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.060\nSo that's what service\ntransition is about.\n\n94\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.940\nAnd eventually service transition is going\nto bring the service into operations.\n\n95\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.510\nAnd that's when the value back to\nthe business can really be delivered,\n\n96\n00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.530\nbecause that's what the service\nis intended to do, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.130\nSo to make this happen, I told\nthe scribes actually seven processes.\n\n98\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.555\nOnly five of these processes are in\nscope of the foundation curriculum.\n\n99\n00:05:17.555 --> 00:05:20.390\nAnd these are the five and\nwe're gonna go in this order.\n\n100\n00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.330\nWe're gonna talk about transition planning\nand support, knowledge management.\n\n101\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.350\nService asset and\nconfiguration management,\n\n102\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.630\noften just pronounced that SACM, right?\n\n103\n00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.320\nChange management and release and\ndeployment management\n\n104\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.210\nare the five processes we're\ngonna discuss for foundation.\n\n105\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.980\nOkay, and service transition.\n\n106\n00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.080\nYou recall in service design\nthere was a mother hen process?\n\n107\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.660\nDo you remember that by any chance,\nDaniel?\n\n108\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.490\n>> I can't say I have.\n\n109\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.340\n>> Design coordination.\n\n110\n00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.740\nDesign coordination was\nthe process in service design\n\n111\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.620\nthat I described as the mother hen.\n\n112\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.530\nIt was responsible or accountable for\n\n113\n00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.510\nensuring that all the other processes\nin that stage were done effectively.\n\n114\n00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.993\nThat they were done on time,\non budget, etc.\n\n115\n00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:05.170\nIt was also the handshake\nwith project management.\n\n116\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.060\nWell, here in service transition,\nwe have a very similar type scope for\n\n117\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.940\na process called transition planning and\nsupport.\n\n118\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.520\nWhat we could look at this is design\ncoordination is to service design,\n\n119\n00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.450\nas transition planning and\nsupport is to service transition, right?\n\n120\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.560\nSo it is the mother hen.\n\n121\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.182\nThe purpose of transition planning and\nsupport is to plan and\n\n122\n00:06:27.182 --> 00:06:31.020\ncoordinate all of the activities\nin service transition.\n\n123\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.360\nSo all those other processes\ndownstream if you will, right,\n\n124\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.728\nwithin service transition.\n\n125\n00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.950\nSo we're gonna talk about those\nknowledge management, SACM,\n\n126\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.150\nservice asset configuration management,\nchange and release management.\n\n127\n00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.670\nWe're gonna talk about those.\n\n128\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.230\nBut transition planning and\nsupport is accountable for\n\n129\n00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.520\nmaking sure those are done and done well,\nefficiently and continue to get better.\n\n130\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.740\nIt's also the handshake\nwith project management.\n\n131\n00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.710\nSo the coordination of all those processes\nof delivering on time and on budget.\n\n132\n00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.760\nSounds a lot like project management,\nright?\n\n133\n00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.670\nAnd that's where this handshake is coming\nto project management discipline, right?\n\n134\n00:07:06.235 --> 00:07:11.549\nSo, this particular process is going to\nensure those appropriate policies and\n\n135\n00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:17.035\nprocesses in place to guide the service\ntransitions stage effectively, right?\n\n136\n00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:21.280\nSo the governance,\nthe policies and standards for\n\n137\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.810\nservice transition activities.\n\n138\n00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.640\nThe measurements, guidance, oversight and\n\n139\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.820\nagain, that handshake\nwith project management.\n\n140\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.210\nSo now moving on to another process,\nknowledge management.\n\n141\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.560\nThis is huge.\n\n142\n00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.780\nKnowledge management is huge.\n\n143\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.870\nI'm just gonna fast forward just\na little bit to a slide to show you how\n\n144\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.080\nhuge it is and then I'll come back, right?\n\n145\n00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.490\nSo if you look at the slide now,\nthis is the scope of knowledge management.\n\n146\n00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.420\nAnd this is not even exhaustive in itself,\nbut look how busy this is.\n\n147\n00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.220\nLook at some of the detail here.\n\n148\n00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.091\nThese little,\nsquiggly ones that have a little\n\n149\n00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:04.360\ncurved bottom Those are all documents,\nall right.\n\n150\n00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.874\nFor instance, policies and plans,\ndown lower left here, policies and\n\n151\n00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:11.550\nplans, how many documents might that be?\n\n152\n00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.810\nI mean, it's not just one document,\nthat could be many different policies,\n\n153\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.110\nmany different plans.\n\n154\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.970\nSo, this is big right?\n\n155\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.690\nService strategy,\nfinancial data, that's huge.\n\n156\n00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.400\nDemand data, business cases,\nservice models.\n\n157\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.990\nLook at all the documents in here and this\nis not representing one document but lots.\n\n158\n00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.670\nLook at the database we got availability\nmanagement information system,\n\n159\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:36.310\na capacity management information system,\na supplier contract management information\n\n160\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.830\nsystem, a security management\ninformation system.\n\n161\n00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.630\nLots of things, right.\n\n162\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.710\nAnd all this underneath a portfolio\nwhich is also possible.\n\n163\n00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.470\nAnd all of this the big shaded area.\n\n164\n00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.260\nAll of it's considered the service\nknowledge management system.\n\n165\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.120\nThe service knowledge management system.\n\n166\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.990\nSo, knowledge management is trying to\nmake sense of this universe, if you will,\n\n167\n00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.375\nor this ocean.\n\n168\n00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:04.525\nOf knowledge that’s floating around\nin the IT service organization.\n\n169\n00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:07.565\nRight, it often floats disconnected,\nright.\n\n170\n00:09:07.565 --> 00:09:11.485\nIt’s trying to provide the connectedness\nthe interconnectedness of this knowledge\n\n171\n00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:16.590\nof these knowledge assets so that you can\nbe effective at managing it, all right?\n\n172\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.670\nSo that's the bigger scope.\n\n173\n00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.280\nNow I'm gonna go back and\n\n174\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.370\npick up some of the nuances of knowledge\nmanagement from a high level, right?\n\n175\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.840\nEffectively, what knowledge\nmanagement's trying to do\n\n176\n00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.780\nis to make sure that you're\nable to share knowledge,\n\n177\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.210\nexperience ideas information, so\nyou don't have to relearn it.\n\n178\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.570\nI can give you some examples\nof this in a moment.\n\n179\n00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.610\nEffectively what you're trying to do\nis to make sure everyone learns from\n\n180\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.680\none person's mistake or\nfrom one person's knowledge, not everyone,\n\n181\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.250\nthe right people learn the right things.\n\n182\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.280\nThink about service disk, friend’s disk.\n\n183\n00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.750\nA service disk gets\nbetter the more it knows.\n\n184\n00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.040\nBut it’s more responsive\nthe more it knows.\n\n185\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.070\nSo, transferring knowledge\nfrom the really smart people.\n\n186\n00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.020\nPerhaps second and\n\n187\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.860\nthird global support to the service disk\nmakes the service disk more effective.\n\n188\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.010\nDetermining away to pass that knowledge\nto service technicians is what now\n\n189\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.680\namendments away but it’s about one\nregard It's about lots of things,\n\n190\n00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.098\nyou saw how big the scope is.\n\n191\n00:10:18.098 --> 00:10:23.984\nRight, all right while ITIL doesn't\npresent an acronym test to you,\n\n192\n00:10:23.984 --> 00:10:28.720\nthere's very few things\nthey test you acronym-wise.\n\n193\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.600\nRACI was one I remember: Responsible,\nAccountable, Consulted, Informed.\n\n194\n00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.860\nThat's one of the acronyms.\n\n195\n00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.300\nDIKW is not necessarily\nan acronym that they'll test.\n\n196\n00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.780\nBut they'll want you to know\nthe order of operations, if you will,\n\n197\n00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.580\nthat that's the order of transformation.\n\n198\n00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:51.300\nKnowledge management has at its\ncore the goal of transforming data\n\n199\n00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.320\ninto information, and transforming\ninformation into knowledge, right?\n\n200\n00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.710\nAnd then people take that knowledge and\nmake wise decisions out of it, right?\n\n201\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.980\nAnd you're just trying to make this\ninformation as widely acknowledged,\n\n202\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.310\navailable as widely as necessary,\nas possible.\n\n203\n00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.220\nSo knowing the order of operations here,\n\n204\n00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.910\nDIKW can be helpful on an exam because\nyou'll need to put them in that order.\n\n205\n00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.660\nIt also just points to\n\n206\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.140\nthe natural progression of what knowledge\nmanagement is trying to engender.\n\n207\n00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.140\nOkay I'd like to describe something else,\nit's not necessarily test worthy but\n\n208\n00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.880\nit's what ITIL refers to\nas the knowledge spiral.\n\n209\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.820\nNow the reason I wanna point this out\nis it kind of describes the culture.\n\n210\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.800\nThe knowledge management process\nis trying to engender, right, so\n\n211\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.040\nit something we need to engender\nas an entire organization,\n\n212\n00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.060\nnot just as a process, right.\n\n213\n00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.880\nI'll give you an example\nfrom my own experience.\n\n214\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.300\nIt was a learning management system,\nI was a technical manager for\n\n215\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.510\na learning management system, and I was\nawake in the three o'clock one morning,\n\n216\n00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.920\nand this system was degrading,\nit was not doing too well.\n\n217\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.510\nThat coincides with when\nEurope's coming online.\n\n218\n00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.840\nAnd then by 8 o'clock in the morning,\nwhen the US starts to come up online,\n\n219\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.050\nthe thing just falls over.\n\n220\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.810\nAnd I don't know what's wrong.\n\n221\n00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:08.270\nRight, five hours later I still\ndo not know what's wrong.\n\n222\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.690\nSo I'm ten hours into the degradation or\n\n223\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:16.100\noutright outage and\nit turned out to be a database issue.\n\n224\n00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.280\nAnd so I won't get into the details of\nthe database issue but it was a database\n\n225\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.900\nissue, nothing my team understood or\nthe application vendor understood, and\n\n226\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.750\nI just happened to get lucky because\nI had a database guy in the room,\n\n227\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.380\nnot on my team, that had an idea.\n\n228\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.910\nHe hadn't even been in the room all\nmorning, but he had an idea what it was.\n\n229\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:37.290\nSo, turns out this database issue,\nI'll call it clouded indexes.\n\n230\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.410\nAnd what he wanted to do was\nrecompile the indexes, and\n\n231\n00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.160\nsure enough that was the issue.\n\n232\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.170\nSo, I learned something that day.\n\n233\n00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.080\nI did not know enough about databases\nbefore that day, I learned something.\n\n234\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.996\nI now have knowledge that databases and\n\n235\n00:12:52.996 --> 00:12:58.240\ntheir indexes need to be recompiled\nevery now and then, news to me.\n\n236\n00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.050\nI took that operational lesson and\nturned it into a tactical lesson.\n\n237\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.260\nI basically got a script from a good DBA\nfriend, there at the same organization.\n\n238\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.505\nI didn't have the skills\nthat I could execute and\n\n239\n00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:16.740\nautomate the Index issue\nwhenever I did maintenance.\n\n240\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.800\nSo that's what I did.\n\n241\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.770\nI had a tactical lesson.\n\n242\n00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.240\nFast forward seven years later.\n\n243\n00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.370\nI'm no longer the technical manager for\nthe learning management system.\n\n244\n00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.930\nI'm now in service management,\n\n245\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.980\nand I've got 30 odd services\nunderneath me on a remit.\n\n246\n00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.130\nAnd I walk in a normal time of day.\n\n247\n00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.620\nIt happened to be the learning\nmanagement system again.\n\n248\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.380\nIt was a different platform,\ndifferent databases and etc.\n\n249\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.510\nBut the same symptoms had\nbeen exposed to them.\n\n250\n00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.290\nAnd I come,\nI looked like a genius that day.\n\n251\n00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.637\nThey're like Terry,\nhave you ever dealt with this before?\n\n252\n00:13:47.637 --> 00:13:49.643\nYeah, did you check the clouded indexes,\nright?\n\n253\n00:13:49.643 --> 00:13:51.750\nAs if I really, yeah was a genius, right?\n\n254\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:56.350\nBut the thing is, what could\nhave happened seven years prior,\n\n255\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.310\nhad I taken the tactical lesson and\nmade it a strategical one.\n\n256\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.590\nA strategic lesson, right?\n\n257\n00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:07.800\nTaking a strategic lesson forward\nto the broader IT organization\n\n258\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.660\nmight have been helpful.\n\n259\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.890\nIt certainly would have forced\nall these five hours that this\n\n260\n00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.810\nlearning management system\nwas again suffering.\n\n261\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.350\nSo I did, I had 30 services.\n\n262\n00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.520\nMy skin in the game was\na little bit different,\n\n263\n00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.950\nbut I wrote a white paper on this issue.\n\n264\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.500\nDescribed what the symptoms were like.\n\n265\n00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.310\nWhat mitigation factors you could\nimplement and published it.\n\n266\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.540\nAnd I had 30 services.\n\n267\n00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.400\nI had some concerns about my 30 services.\n\n268\n00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.170\nI did my own research on my 30 services.\n\n269\n00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.220\nAnd, I got a lot of attention\nfrom that white paper.\n\n270\n00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.330\nOther folks said, yeah,\nwe might be exposed, too.\n\n271\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.400\nWhy don't we get a team of DVAs together,\nand\n\n272\n00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.430\nstart really analyzing\nour vulnerability here?\n\n273\n00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.100\nHere and\nwe did we gathered the DBA team for\n\n274\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:56.100\napplication support and\nthey did good work for us right?\n\n275\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.860\nAnd we forestalled that problem\nfrom happening anymore right?\n\n276\n00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.150\nWe didn't, we had a way to methodically\nmanage that potential risk.\n\n277\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.990\nSo again I experienced a risk,\nI experienced a failure right?\n\n278\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.830\nI learned something.\n\n279\n00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.180\nI took a tactic to help myself.\n\n280\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.100\nBut knowledge management wanna say, well,\nlet's make this a knowledge spiral.\n\n281\n00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.630\nLet's spiral this up and\nout so that other people\n\n282\n00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:23.260\ncan also benefit from that knowledge, and\nwe don't have to face this pain later on.\n\n283\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.390\nThat's what knowledge management's\ntrying to get done, right?\n\n284\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.590\nOkay now I've already\nshown you how big it is.\n\n285\n00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.840\nThis social knowledge\nmanagement system is huge.\n\n286\n00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.160\nHere it is in more textual form\ninstead of graphical form.\n\n287\n00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.410\nHow many things are involved, SLAs, OLAs.\n\n288\n00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.220\nWe'll talk about the definitive\nmeta library in just a moment.\n\n289\n00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:48.267\nEven discussion forums,\ndiagnostic scripts, all sorts of things\n\n290\n00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:53.060\ncan be part of the knowledge\nmanagement system in its entirety.\n\n291\n00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.900\nSo it is huge.\n\n292\n00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.922\nWe'll talk about the CMS in a moment.\n\n293\n00:15:57.922 --> 00:16:00.290\nWe have\nthe Configuration Management System.\n\n294\n00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.250\nIt is a subset of the SKMS.\n\n295\n00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:08.100\nAnd then underneath the CMS, there can\nbe configuration management databases.\n\n296\n00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.320\nIt's a subset of the CMS.\n\n297\n00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.860\nRight.\nSo CMDBs are a subset of the CMS.\n\n298\n00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:19.080\nThe CMS is a subset of the SKMS,\nwhich is just huge.\n\n299\n00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.710\nIf you consider the Configuration\nManagement System as being a great big\n\n300\n00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:29.130\nboat and configuration management\ndatabases are containers on that boat.\n\n301\n00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.400\nThe SKMS is like the sea\nthat the boats floating on,\n\n302\n00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.320\nit's just huge how many\nthings it contains, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.310\nAnd, that leads us back to this picture\nthat we started the conversation with.\n\n304\n00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.690\nThe SKMS is huge in scope and\nit's intended to be.\n\n305\n00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:46.100\nAnd what you're trying to do with\na knowledge management process\n\n306\n00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.385\nis get your hands around this.\n\n307\n00:16:47.385 --> 00:16:52.200\nIn some regards it might be considered\naspirational, like you'll never get there,\n\n308\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.850\nand I think that's probably true in some\nregards because you never know everything,\n\n309\n00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.130\nyou're learning something everyday.\n\n310\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:03.700\nSo this has to be rather elastic in\nits concept, or in its construction.\n\n311\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.340\n>> It sure seems like we meet people\nin our lives, in our businesses,\n\n312\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.040\nthat do seem like they have a-\n>> Yes.\n\n313\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.760\n>> A nice grasp on this area.\n\n314\n00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.509\n>> Yep.\nYeah.\n\n315\n00:17:11.509 --> 00:17:12.835\n>> How do you know all these things?\n\n316\n00:17:12.835 --> 00:17:13.517\n>> Exactly.\n\n317\n00:17:13.517 --> 00:17:14.708\n>> How do you understand all these?\n\n318\n00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:19.200\nHow did you even know this little tiny\nnuance detail of a area of our job\n\n319\n00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.373\nthat's not even related to you?\n\n320\n00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:21.960\n>> Exactly.\n\n321\n00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.200\n>> Well, you know, I knew Bob that ran\nthat organization for 20 years and.\n\n322\n00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.540\n>> Right.\n>> It just gets crazy.\n\n323\n00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.440\n>> And I think there's a lot\nof IT departments that\n\n324\n00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.425\nhave a culture of knowledge share.\n\n325\n00:17:33.425 --> 00:17:35.980\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And I think there's IT departments out\n\n326\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.770\nthere that have a culture\nof knowledge retention.\n\n327\n00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:39.480\nThey hold it.\n\n328\n00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:39.990\nRight?\n\n329\n00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.130\nAnd there's folks that\nsay knowledge is power.\n\n330\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:42.755\nRight?\n\n331\n00:17:42.755 --> 00:17:46.080\nITIL's trying to explode that particular\ntype of IT organization saying no this is\n\n332\n00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.480\nsomething you need to share.\n\n333\n00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.209\nMake it broadly available, right?\n\n334\n00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.280\nAll right, good deal.\n\n335\n00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.260\nAnd one more process in this episode,\n\n336\n00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.550\nin service transition then we'll have\na couple more in another episode,\n\n337\n00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.540\nis the Service Asset and\nConfiguration Management process.\n\n338\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:08.920\nI abbreviate it SACM in my talking,\nand you can see the acronym there.\n\n339\n00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.971\nAgain, it's not an acronym test, they'll\nalways spell it out, on the actual exams,\n\n340\n00:18:12.971 --> 00:18:16.150\nso don't feel like you have\nto memorize acronyms, okay.\n\n341\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.920\nBut before we actually\nget into the big picture,\n\n342\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.800\nI'm gonna dive down in some detail first,\nright.\n\n343\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.250\nAnd what is a configuration item, right?\n\n344\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.990\nA CI, if you will.\n\n345\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.140\nWhat is the configuration item?\n\n346\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.340\nAnd please look at the definition here.\n\n347\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:36.030\nAny asset, or service component or\nother item which is,\n\n348\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.930\nor will be, under the control\nof configuration management and\n\n349\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.250\nsupports the delivery of a service.\n\n350\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.020\nThat's a very broad definition.\n\n351\n00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.500\nI want you to have a very broad\ndefinition in your own mind.\n\n352\n00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.800\nIt's gonna help you on\nthe exam if you think broadly.\n\n353\n00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.810\nIt's gonna help you certainly,\neven as you go back into the office and\n\n354\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.460\ntry to implement SACM,\nto understand it broadly.\n\n355\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.210\nAnd then maybe you start\ntrimming it down and\n\n356\n00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.470\nworking on a subset of the universe\nof CI's that might be out there.\n\n357\n00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.400\nBut look at some of these.\n\n358\n00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.640\nSome of the examples we\nsee on the screen here.\n\n359\n00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.520\nFirst of all, organizations that\ndefine what is gonna be a CI,\n\n360\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.450\nthey're gonna define what's\ngonna be under control.\n\n361\n00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.540\nAnd there are many assets that you\nchoose not to make a CI, right.\n\n362\n00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:26.850\nAs an example, a file server is, or\nmay be, both a CI and a service asset.\n\n363\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.810\nSo you'd want to know how\nmany servers you have.\n\n364\n00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.550\nYou wanna know what\npatch level they're on.\n\n365\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.390\nWhat OS they have installed on them,\netc right.\n\n366\n00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.970\nSo those kind of attributes related to\nthat server asset need to be stored\n\n367\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.820\nsomewhere, right?\n\n368\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.065\nSo you might call a server an asset.\n\n369\n00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:44.775\nYou might call a database an asset.\n\n370\n00:19:44.775 --> 00:19:47.485\nYou might call an application an asset and\n\n371\n00:19:47.485 --> 00:19:51.635\nyou might also call them CIs because you\nwant to keep them under control, right?\n\n372\n00:19:53.655 --> 00:19:55.922\nA document like an architectural diagram.\n\n373\n00:19:55.922 --> 00:20:00.212\nA document itself could be a CI and\nan asset.\n\n374\n00:20:00.212 --> 00:20:02.312\nI think it's easy to see it as an asset.\n\n375\n00:20:02.312 --> 00:20:07.145\nHaving an architectural diagram helps you\nunderstand how the application is set up\n\n376\n00:20:07.145 --> 00:20:09.300\nor how the service is setup, right?\n\n377\n00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.340\nThat's important information, right.\n\n378\n00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.850\nIt can inform a good training document.\n\n379\n00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.310\nIt can inform a good\ntroubleshooting exercise, right?\n\n380\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.540\nSo an architectural diagram\nis certainly an asset.\n\n381\n00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.160\nYou could also consider that a CI\n\n382\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.840\nif you want to keep that\nasset under control, right.\n\n383\n00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.600\nSo this difference between an asset and\n\n384\n00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.920\na CI is really how much control you\nwanna have over these things, right?\n\n385\n00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.920\nNow even, let's say employee attributes\nlike what department I belong to, or who\n\n386\n00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.470\nmy boss is could be important information\nabout an asset that's an employee.\n\n387\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:44.800\nThat you wanna keep under control.\n\n388\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.280\nNow, obviously,\nyou're not controlling the asset directly.\n\n389\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.930\nYou're controlling\nthe attributes of that asset\n\n390\n00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.750\nin a logical model of some kind, right?\n\n391\n00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:59.230\nBut even employee data could\nbe considered a CI, right?\n\n392\n00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:05.450\nSo, if you think of the big idea of\nwhat a CI is, it's very inclusive.\n\n393\n00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.700\nI want to ask you some\nprobing rhetorical questions.\n\n394\n00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.650\nWould it make sense that each one of these\nCI's be stored in the same repository?\n\n395\n00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.940\nLet me put it a different way.\n\n396\n00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.760\nWould you store information about your\nemployees in the same database as\n\n397\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.300\ninformation about your servers,\nand applications, and databases?\n\n398\n00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.680\nWhat do you think Daniel?\n\n399\n00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.215\n>> I guess we just, probably not.\n\n400\n00:21:27.215 --> 00:21:28.470\n[LAUGH]\n>> Probably not, right?\n\n401\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.450\nProbably not, and\nI appreciate the probably not.\n\n402\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.390\nMaybe you do, maybe you don't,\nbut probably not.\n\n403\n00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:37.915\nYour employee data might be in a different\ntype of repository than your server and\n\n404\n00:21:37.915 --> 00:21:41.906\napplication, and database,\nand network data, right?\n\n405\n00:21:41.906 --> 00:21:45.958\nAnd then add to that your document data,\nthe data about your documents might be yet\n\n406\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:47.390\nin another repository.\n\n407\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:52.320\nSo the construction that ITIL\nhas in mind is those separate\n\n408\n00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.460\nrepositories are separate\nConfiguration Management Databases, CMDBs.\n\n409\n00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:03.120\nAnd collectively those CMDBs form\na federated model if you will,\n\n410\n00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.900\nof data that forms the CMS,\nthe bigger construction, right?\n\n411\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.730\nSo, that's what SACM is trying to enable,\nis the CMS that\n\n412\n00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.200\ncontains multiple CMDBs, right?\n\n413\n00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.049\nOkay so, now we got into the detail,\n\n414\n00:22:19.049 --> 00:22:23.476\nlet's take our 5,000 foot view back to\nService Asset Configuration Management.\n\n415\n00:22:23.476 --> 00:22:26.890\nAs a process it's trying to make sure\nthat those CIs that we just talked about,\n\n416\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.180\nconfiguration items,\nare under control, right?\n\n417\n00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.200\nThat you identify them, you control them,\nyou got good information,\n\n418\n00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.920\nand that you know\nthe relationship among them.\n\n419\n00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.695\nSo it's not just enough to have attributes\nrelated to each one of these CIs,\n\n420\n00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:44.140\nthat you know how they\ninteract with each other.\n\n421\n00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:49.260\nAs an example, do you know that this\napplication is installed on this server,\n\n422\n00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.142\nfor instance?\n\n423\n00:22:50.142 --> 00:22:52.760\nThat would be a good relationship to\nunderstand because if you're gonna do\n\n424\n00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.940\nmaintenance in this server, you understand\nwhat the application impact might be,\n\n425\n00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.530\nor at least you investigate that.\n\n426\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.830\nIf you have a list of documents\nthat affect a service.\n\n427\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.000\nDo they need to be updated\nas you update the service?\n\n428\n00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.730\nDo you need to go back and\ntouch your documents?\n\n429\n00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.000\nSo knowing that those are interrelated.\n\n430\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.080\nIf you changed the architecture, maybe\nyou need to go back to that architectural\n\n431\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.300\ndiagram and then tweak it, right?\n\n432\n00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.546\nSo the inter-relationship among these\nassets is also part of the goals or\n\n433\n00:23:19.546 --> 00:23:21.440\npurpose of SACM, right?\n\n434\n00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.680\nAnd the scope,\nas we've described before is\n\n435\n00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.840\nmaking sure that you understand these CIs,\nyou have them under control.\n\n436\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.630\nAll things that you care about and\nwant to control are a CI, okay.\n\n437\n00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:40.220\nNow it is a logical configuration model,\nas I mentioned before,\n\n438\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.140\nyou're not controlling your\nemployees through SACM,\n\n439\n00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.220\nyou're controlling the attributes\nrelated to these employees.\n\n440\n00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.870\nIt's not that you're controlling\nthe servers that are in that CMDB.\n\n441\n00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:55.650\nYou're controlling the attributes\nrelated to that server, right?\n\n442\n00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.700\nSo it's a logical model,\nnot a physical one.\n\n443\n00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.400\nRight?\n\n444\n00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.426\nAnd certainly, you're trying to reflect\nphysical reality that the server has its\n\n445\n00:24:03.426 --> 00:24:07.610\napplication installed but it is a logical\nconstruction, not a physical one.\n\n446\n00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.760\nRight?\nAnd that's what this graphic is trying to\n\n447\n00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.830\nshow you, how these things\nare inter related to each other and\n\n448\n00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:18.462\nthe ability to show their\ninterrelationships is a key goal of SACM.\n\n449\n00:24:18.462 --> 00:24:19.570\nOkay.\n\n450\n00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:25.810\nAnd as we described before,\nthe CMS is part of the larger SKMS and\n\n451\n00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.890\nthis graphic is also\nreinforcing that CMDB,\n\n452\n00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:35.030\nit's configuration management databases\nare inside the CMS or a subset of the CMS.\n\n453\n00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.590\nSo, understanding that relationship,\nthe biggest one's the SKMS,\n\n454\n00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:43.580\nI described it earlier as the SKMS is like\nthe ocean The CMS might be considered\n\n455\n00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.550\na great big ship and the CMDBs\nare containers on top of that ship.\n\n456\n00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.904\nYou can consider it that way,\ntoo, if that helps you.\n\n457\n00:24:49.904 --> 00:24:52.130\nOkay, all right.\n\n458\n00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.370\nNow, a very specific type of\n\n459\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.150\nasset is software,\nwhether it's off the shelf purchased or\n\n460\n00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.050\nsomething you've homegrown\ninside the organization.\n\n461\n00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.350\nKeeping up with your software assets,\nso those software CIs.\n\n462\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:14.100\nThey have a very special location and\nwhy IT calls the definitive media library.\n\n463\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.020\nNow, if you look at the graphic,\nit's kinda cute.\n\n464\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.030\nAt least it's cute in terms\nof going back in time.\n\n465\n00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.035\n>> Not like a puppy.\n\n466\n00:25:22.035 --> 00:25:23.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> Not like that, right.\n\n467\n00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.270\nBut look this is actually a physical\ncabinet with floppy disks and\n\n468\n00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.515\ndisk drives in it and tape reels.\n\n469\n00:25:31.515 --> 00:25:32.020\nRight?\n\n470\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.463\n>> That's what we use here.\n\n471\n00:25:33.463 --> 00:25:35.697\n>> Are you still using\nthose little floppies?\n\n472\n00:25:35.697 --> 00:25:39.495\n[CROSSTALK] And really I didn't know about\nfor a long time what these might be,\n\n473\n00:25:39.495 --> 00:25:41.023\nthese little boxes at the top.\n\n474\n00:25:41.023 --> 00:25:45.237\nBut someone said maybe they're\nboxes of Fortran cards,\n\n475\n00:25:45.237 --> 00:25:49.130\nto configure your assets\non a mainframe computer.\n\n476\n00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.250\nSo maybe that's what that is.\n\n477\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:55.020\nSo obviously we've kind of grown\nbeyond the physical cabinet\n\n478\n00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.850\nidea where these assets\nare more stored electronically.\n\n479\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.090\nBut the idea of having these\nin control in a known place\n\n480\n00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.760\nis what a Definitive of\nMedia Library is about, right?\n\n481\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.430\nSo you know where the latest version\nof Adobe Acrobat is stored and\n\n482\n00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.390\nwhen you're configuring a desktop for\nyour employees you get it from that\n\n483\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.550\ndefinitive source and\nyou load it up right?\n\n484\n00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.540\nThose kinds of things.\n\n485\n00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:24.560\nOr you know where your images are for\noperating system, etc., all right.\n\n486\n00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.720\nSo it's the definitive source or\nthe Definitive Media Library, it's\n\n487\n00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:35.170\nthe definitive location of your software\nassets, right, for control purposes.\n\n488\n00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.210\nAnd it includes control documentation.\n\n489\n00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.650\nHow many times it's been installed,\n\n490\n00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:42.180\non what assets including license control,\nright?\n\n491\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.790\nAnd again once upon a time it was\na physical construction, right?\n\n492\n00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.450\nIt was a box.\n\n493\n00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:46.630\nIt was a cabinet and\n\n494\n00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:50.870\nthere was actually physical license\nagreements in that cabinet, right?\n\n495\n00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:55.050\nAnd you showed your control on physical\nchecklists and those kind of things.\n\n496\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.730\nEven though it's more electronic now,\n\n497\n00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.620\nthis construction of Definitive Media\nLibrary is still in play and that you need\n\n498\n00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.930\nto have a Definitive Media Library to\nsuccessfully manage your software assets.\n\n499\n00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.900\nAnd remember, it's not just for\noff the shelf assets like if you buy\n\n500\n00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:14.460\nMicrosoft Word or Office, or\nany other type of asset, software asset.\n\n501\n00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.028\nIt could be those that you home grow,\nyour self developed software and\n\n502\n00:27:18.028 --> 00:27:19.912\nyou have your known versions there.\n\n503\n00:27:19.912 --> 00:27:24.865\nSo it's just a very special repository for\nthe very special assets called software,\n\n504\n00:27:24.865 --> 00:27:26.530\nDefinitive Media Library.\n\n505\n00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:32.010\nThat concluded our first part\nof service transition, and\n\n506\n00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.350\nremember we did the overall picture,\ntransition planning and\n\n507\n00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.320\nsupport, that processes is the mother hen.\n\n508\n00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.640\nWe talked about knowledge management, DIKW\ndata, information, knowledge and wisdom.\n\n509\n00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:50.400\nWe also reinforced that it engenders\nthis great big thing called the SKMS.\n\n510\n00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.000\nWe talked about SACUM and\n\n511\n00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.300\nit's ability to bring about a CMS,\na configuration management system\n\n512\n00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.940\nwith multiple configuration management\ndatabases or CMDBs inside of it.\n\n513\n00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.550\nWe've got two more processes to go,\nwe'll pick it up in the next episode.\n\n514\n00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.420\n>> Awesome stuff Terry.\n\n515\n00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.610\nWell, thanks for\ngetting us through part one.\n\n516\n00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.080\nUnfortunately, our time for\nthis episode has expired but don't worry,\n\n517\n00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.770\npart two is coming right away and\nif you're watching this live,\n\n518\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:20.220\nwe'll be right back and if not you can\nhave us right back any time you want\n\n519\n00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.161\nbecause it's a recording and\nyou can watch it.\n\n520\n00:28:22.161 --> 00:28:23.140\n[LAUGH] So a lot of good times there.\n\n521\n00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.020\nTerry we look forward to seeing you there.\n\n522\n00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.180\nWe look forward to seeing you\ngood folks there as well.\n\n523\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.134\nBut as for this one we're gonna go\nahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n524\n00:28:30.134 --> 00:28:31.498\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n525\n00:28:31.498 --> 00:28:32.446\n>> And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n526\n00:28:32.446 --> 00:28:34.791\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n527\n00:28:34.791 --> 00:28:43.270\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:17.803\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:21.680\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our ITIL foundation series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.460\nJoining us in the studio today\nis our good friend, our mentor,\n\n6\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.880\nour guiding star in this endeavor,\nMr. Terry Decker.\n\n7\n00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.780\nTerry welcome back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.340\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.290\n>> It's good to be back.\n\n10\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.132\nYeah, happy to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:34.060\nYou'll recall that we had\nservice transition queued up for\n\n12\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.880\nour last episode and\nwe went through three of the processes.\n\n13\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.750\nWe went through transition planning and\nsupport, that mother hen.\n\n14\n00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.210\nKnowledge management and service asset and\nconfiguration management.\n\n15\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.390\nWe've got two more to go,\nchange management and release and\n\n16\n00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.220\ndeployment management.\n\n17\n00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.500\nSo that's where we are.\n\n18\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.490\nAnd where we're going,\nall right lets dig in.\n\n19\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.670\nActually before talking about\nchange in any kind of detail or\n\n20\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.845\nrelease management in any kind of detail,\nI'd liked to do a little compare and\n\n21\n00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:02.590\ncontrast between change and\nrelease at the point of management.\n\n22\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.460\nThis may be my own baggage but\nI know for a good amount of time I was\n\n23\n00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.440\nconfused over where changed end, and where\nrelease started and how they integrated.\n\n24\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.930\nAnd this graphic here really\ndoes do a good amount\n\n25\n00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050\nof justice to how they're integrated.\n\n26\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.390\nIt's not like one ends and\n\n27\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.960\nthe other one picks up,\nthey often get back together, right?\n\n28\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.850\nSo they're an iterative interaction\nbetween change and release management.\n\n29\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.340\nAnd the simplest way to describe this is\nchanged management is the authorization\n\n30\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.140\nbody, if you will, and release and\ndeployment is the execution arm,\n\n31\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.435\nthey get it done, in RACI terms, R, A,\nC, I that is, you may consider changes,\n\n32\n00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:49.930\nthe accountable, and\nrelease as the responsible.\n\n33\n00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.580\nChange, authorizes things to happen,\nrelease and\n\n34\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.120\ndeployment management get it done, right?\n\n35\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.690\nAnd it does so iteratively.\n\n36\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.680\nAs you can see any given change\nmight have several phases.\n\n37\n00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.310\nRight?\n\n38\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.200\nAnd they describe here the phases\nof release and deployment process.\n\n39\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.730\nSo we're kinda teaching a little\nbit of both here at the same time.\n\n40\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.000\nBut imagine if you will, the change\n\n41\n00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.900\nmanagement process entertaining 10 changes\nthat come to their attention, right?\n\n42\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.660\nChange management process is\nlooking at 10 changes and\n\n43\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.140\nthey send those 10 changes down to\nrelease and deployment management.\n\n44\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.010\nSo hey plan these for us.\n\n45\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.340\nRight so\nthey authorize the release planning.\n\n46\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.570\nSo even that's a milestone\nthat gets approved.\n\n47\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.747\nRight they may look, maybe they got\n15 change requests, and they say,\n\n48\n00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:39.760\nwell we're not gonna do those 5,\nand they reject them out of hand.\n\n49\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.580\nMaybe they're too expensive or\nthey're covered by some other change\n\n50\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.640\nthat was requested six weeks\nago that sort of thing.\n\n51\n00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.536\nBut they send 10 of those changes down\nto release and deployment, release and\n\n52\n00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:53.435\ndeployment looks at those 10 changes and\ndecides to package them.\n\n53\n00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.655\nThese five are kind of break fix items and\n\n54\n00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:59.005\nthese other five are enhancements,\nsome sort of enhancements.\n\n55\n00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:00.735\nSo they divide them up and\n\n56\n00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:05.430\nthey send those packages back along with\na recommendation for when they could be\n\n57\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.210\nbuilt when they could be deployed\neventually and tested etcetera.\n\n58\n00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.877\nRight.\nSo they've sent back a plan to the change\n\n59\n00:03:11.877 --> 00:03:16.656\nauthority and change management and change\nmanagement looks at the two packages and\n\n60\n00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:20.160\nsays, yeah we like the timing\nof these break fix things.\n\n61\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.580\nWe go ahead and\napprove you to build and to test those.\n\n62\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.080\nRight?\n\n63\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.290\nSo there's another milestone that's met,\nright?\n\n64\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.770\nAnd back and forth, they go.\n\n65\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.190\nSo now you got two packages on\ntwo separate timelines, right?\n\n66\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.860\nOne's the enhancements, one's the break\nfix and they're now managed as a group\n\n67\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.650\nthat will be managed together and release\nand deployment's doing all that hard work\n\n68\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.490\nof planning, building it, testing it,\nand eventually deploying it, right.\n\n69\n00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.250\nIn an iterative fashion,\nthen, Change Management and\n\n70\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.940\nRelease Management are interacting,\nright, along these milestones.\n\n71\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.370\nChange being the authorizing process,\nrelease and\n\n72\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.340\ndeployment being the execution process,\nactually getting it done, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.550\nSo it's moving forward then.\n\n74\n00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.220\nChange management then, the focus now is\nto control the life cycle of all stages,\n\n75\n00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.480\nall changes, I should say,\n\n76\n00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.350\nfrom that's time it's requested to\nthe time it's ultimately deployed.\n\n77\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.130\nAnd tied up in a nice neat bow, right.\n\n78\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.920\nAnd the goal is to enable beneficial\nchanges, right do no harm.\n\n79\n00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.970\nMake sure you're doing benefit when\nyou're bringing those changes in, right.\n\n80\n00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.280\nIt could be something small,\nit could be something big.\n\n81\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.610\nChange management is not just focused\non the day to day grind of change,\n\n82\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.700\nlike break fix things.\n\n83\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.531\nIt could be huge things, big changes\nto services, that is the scope, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.275\nAll configuration Items.\n\n85\n00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:53.695\nRemember we learned\nwhen we discussed SAKUM\n\n86\n00:04:53.695 --> 00:04:57.405\nthat CIs are those service assets\nthat you wanna keep under control.\n\n87\n00:04:58.475 --> 00:05:00.915\nChange management is\nthat method of control.\n\n88\n00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:02.140\nOnce you've identified them,\n\n89\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.210\nchanged management is going to make sure\nthey're changed in a controlled fashion.\n\n90\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.930\nRight?\nThey could\n\n91\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.790\nbe physical assets like servers and\ndatabases and applications.\n\n92\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.020\nThey could be documentation assets, right?\n\n93\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.020\nWhat you've determine to be a CI\nis something you determined to be\n\n94\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.896\nunder change control, right.\n\n95\n00:05:21.622 --> 00:05:26.180\nNew and change services,\nretired services, technology, management,\n\n96\n00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.210\nanything that you consider a CI can be in\nthe scope of changed management, right.\n\n97\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.930\nThere are some things you\nmight consider out of scope.\n\n98\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.280\nThere's changes that happen every day\nthat perhaps aren't in scope with change\n\n99\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.360\nmanagement, you determine you\ndon't need to control those,\n\n100\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.960\nyou trust the process\nthat's working just fine.\n\n101\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.030\nThat's organizationally\ndefined as you see fit.\n\n102\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.340\nOkay, in the organization, okay.\n\n103\n00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.720\nNow gonna pick up some words\nhere as we go as always.\n\n104\n00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.510\nOn the next couple of slides,\nwe're gonna be learning some vocabulary.\n\n105\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.570\nOne of the vocabulary words, one of\nthe things you need to commit to memory\n\n106\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.260\nis what is the definition of a change\nproposal, or what is a change proposal?\n\n107\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.820\nDo you recall we talked\nabout a business case?\n\n108\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.890\nRight a business case was a justification\nfor a significant item of expense.\n\n109\n00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.780\nAnd we kind of hashed around\nwhat's significant, right?\n\n110\n00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.240\nFor one organization,\n$5,000 might be significant, for\n\n111\n00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.560\nanother one it might be $50,000, right.\n\n112\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.030\nYou can kind of have those\ndifferent place and significance.\n\n113\n00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.890\nBut a change proposal is at\nthe same scale as a business case.\n\n114\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.630\nA business case is for\na significant item of expense.\n\n115\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.670\nA change proposal is for a significant\nsize change, or impactful change.\n\n116\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.730\nSo, it's something big, right?\n\n117\n00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.260\nIt's not your day to day request for\nchange like I want the button to be blue\n\n118\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.719\ninstead of red or I want to fix the bug\nthat you found last week,right?\n\n119\n00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:58.480\nThose tend to be the requests for\nchange in the change management scope.\n\n120\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.410\nChange proposal are also in the change\nmanagement they just happen to be bigger.\n\n121\n00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.400\nSo they may get passed back\nup to service strategy.\n\n122\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.320\nAnd service strategy would publish or\nwould put out the change proposals.\n\n123\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.273\nSays yes this is big we\nare wanting this to happen and\n\n124\n00:07:13.273 --> 00:07:15.890\nit's something, again significant size.\n\n125\n00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.080\n>> So\nwould a good description of that be say,\n\n126\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.730\nwe've got a website, and like you said,\nI want the button to blue instead of gray,\n\n127\n00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.520\nI think it looks better,\nit's more attractive.\n\n128\n00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.733\nThat's the minor thing.\n\n129\n00:07:26.733 --> 00:07:32.417\nWhereas, we're using Microsoft IIS to\nrun our website, let's move to Apache?\n\n130\n00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:35.642\n>> A great example, that's significant,\nit requires a lot of coordination,\n\n131\n00:07:35.642 --> 00:07:39.060\nthere's potential for failure,\nyou got a lot of testing involved, right.\n\n132\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.848\nIt requires investment, right,\nso, you've got that business case\n\n133\n00:07:42.848 --> 00:07:47.084\njustifying how much money we're gonna\nspend on this migration to Apache, and\n\n134\n00:07:47.084 --> 00:07:50.510\nyou got the technical complexity\nof moving from IIS to Apache.\n\n135\n00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.738\nIt's a very good example Daniel.\n\n136\n00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:52.416\nThank you.\nI'm gonna quote\n\n137\n00:07:52.416 --> 00:07:54.622\nyou in a future class on that\n[CROSSTALK] very good, very good.\n\n138\n00:07:54.622 --> 00:08:02.010\n[LAUGH] Good Again some more words,\nRFC, Request For Change.\n\n139\n00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.010\nThis is more of the normal type changes,\nright?\n\n140\n00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.910\nI want the button to be blue.\n\n141\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.700\nThe big one is for change proposals.\n\n142\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.570\nRFCs are more manageable even\nafter the service and operation.\n\n143\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.121\nYou are changing an existing service.\n\n144\n00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.088\n>> I'll tell you what,\n\n145\n00:08:17.088 --> 00:08:20.278\nI wish I would have had this class back\nwhen I worked in IT as a sys admin.\n\n146\n00:08:20.278 --> 00:08:22.984\nBecause we went from a very simple project\n\n147\n00:08:22.984 --> 00:08:26.010\nmanagement system that\nwe designed in house.\n\n148\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.950\n>> Right.\n>> Very simple.\n\n149\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.170\nHere's a work ticket.\n\n150\n00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.430\nHere's what I did.\n\n151\n00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.670\nHere's who I spoke with.\n\n152\n00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.470\nOpen, close, easy.\n\n153\n00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.278\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n154\n00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:37.361\n>> Then we decided we're gonna create this\nwhole entire change management system and\n\n155\n00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:41.071\nit had terms like this,\nchange request, change proposal.\n\n156\n00:08:41.071 --> 00:08:43.010\nAnd it's like well,\naren't they the same thing?\n\n157\n00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.640\nAnd they weren't really good\nat schooling us up with that.\n\n158\n00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.010\nWe really needed to have gone through\na class like this so that we would\n\n159\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.310\nunderstand that process a whole lot\nbetter because we just didn't get it.\n\n160\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:57.090\nEspecially coming from something that\nwas so much more simplistic we thought,\n\n161\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.130\nisn't this the same thing,\nbut obviously that it's not.\n\n162\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.750\n>> Right.\nAnd that's really cool because that\n\n163\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.760\nreinforces one of\nthe biggest values of ITIL\n\n164\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.290\nis that it does give us a common language.\n\n165\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.570\nI guess maybe the demerit if\nyou will if you're outsider and\n\n166\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.665\ndon't know the language,\nyou don't understand it, right?\n\n167\n00:09:12.665 --> 00:09:14.290\n>> Right.\n>> So it's kind of a double edged sword.\n\n168\n00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.980\nYou need to know the language\nto be able to talk the talk and\n\n169\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.280\nthen eventually walk the walk.\n\n170\n00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.220\n>> Exactly.\n\n171\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.590\n>> So a request for change is simply that.\n\n172\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.740\nI want this to happen, right?\n\n173\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.496\nAnd then we have change types.\n\n174\n00:09:27.496 --> 00:09:32.080\nI'm gonna go in reverse order here as\nthey're listed on the slide, emergency,\n\n175\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.590\nstandard, and normal.\n\n176\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.822\nI am gonna go in reverse order here.\n\n177\n00:09:36.822 --> 00:09:38.277\nAn emergency change.\n\n178\n00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:42.716\nI once asked a classroom full of\nstudents what's an emergency change?\n\n179\n00:09:42.716 --> 00:09:47.615\nAnd one of the responses was any\nchange that basically can't wait for\n\n180\n00:09:47.615 --> 00:09:51.560\nthe normal change cycle and\nhas to implemented.\n\n181\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.820\nYeah, that's pretty good.\n\n182\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.370\nIt's also pretty broad.\n\n183\n00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.985\nBroad enough to drive a truck through,\nin many ways.\n\n184\n00:09:57.985 --> 00:10:02.086\nAnd as an IT service provider, if it's so\nbroad without any really criteria\n\n185\n00:10:02.086 --> 00:10:06.006\nunderneath it or backing it up,\nthen everything becomes an emergency.\n\n186\n00:10:06.006 --> 00:10:08.794\nBecause anyone can say, you know,\nI don't wanna wait a week.\n\n187\n00:10:08.794 --> 00:10:10.670\nI want it tomorrow, right?\n\n188\n00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.060\nAnd they could just say okay,\n\n189\n00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.640\nwell if we want it tomorrow\nthen that meets the criteria.\n\n190\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.730\nIt's an emergency.\n\n191\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.540\nWell could they have waited a week?\n\n192\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.606\nMaybe they could have.\n\n193\n00:10:17.606 --> 00:10:22.574\nIf you have the right kind of criteria to\nassess that scenario it's gonna be a wiser\n\n194\n00:10:22.574 --> 00:10:23.873\nemergency process.\n\n195\n00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.892\nBecause you don't wanna\nmanage by emergency.\n\n196\n00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:30.260\n>> So it needs to be something that's\nmore impacting the business continuity?\n\n197\n00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:30.860\n>> Yes.\n\n198\n00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.110\n>> We can't wait for\nthe normal change cycle to\n\n199\n00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.840\ngo through because our website is down and\nwe're a web-driven business.\n\n200\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.930\n>> Right.\n>> That's an emergency.\n\n201\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.070\n>> Or it's about to fall\ndown unless we do something.\n\n202\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.490\nRight.\nIt could be about to fall down, so\n\n203\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.750\nyou wanna get in front of the fall down.\n\n204\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.530\nYeah, exactly.\n\n205\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.127\nSo, or a risk of life and limb.\n\n206\n00:10:48.127 --> 00:10:49.327\nThe production line's gonna stop.\n\n207\n00:10:49.327 --> 00:10:50.487\nWe're gonna lose money.\n\n208\n00:10:50.487 --> 00:10:55.000\nOr if we don't fix this and the FDA\nfinds about it, we're gonna get fined.\n\n209\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.580\nThose kinds of real impactful things.\n\n210\n00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.390\nIf you define the criteria\nof emergency more\n\n211\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.910\nnarrowly than just anytime someone\nwants something outside a cycle,\n\n212\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.840\nyou're gonna have a better way of managing\nyour change is really what it points to.\n\n213\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.640\nAnd even if there is something that comes\nthat doesn't quite fit the criteria\n\n214\n00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.710\nat least you're managing by\nexception instead of by rule,\n\n215\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.490\nmeaning not everything's an emergency,\nright?\n\n216\n00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.711\nAnd then you have Standard changes.\n\n217\n00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:23.147\nSo Emergency is those special kind\nof changes that must be done, right?\n\n218\n00:11:23.147 --> 00:11:29.059\nA Standard change is a change that's gone\nthrough an approval process one time and\n\n219\n00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:33.300\nit's been vetted by\nthe appropriate authorities.\n\n220\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.520\nAnd it's agreed that you can just\ndo this whenever you need to.\n\n221\n00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.000\nIt doesn't decrease the amount\nof documentation you need,\n\n222\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.150\nthe amount of testing or\nremediation planning etcetera.\n\n223\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.420\nIt just means you don't have\nto come back for approval.\n\n224\n00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.690\nGive you an example from my own experience\nin our learning management system.\n\n225\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.440\nThe currency rates would\nchange every now and then.\n\n226\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.850\nAnd as those rates change we\nneeded to go in the back end and\n\n227\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.080\nupdate the conversion\nrate in the data base.\n\n228\n00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.700\nRight.\n\n229\n00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.430\nSo since we had to go on the back end,\nthat was a type of change that said,\n\n230\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.100\nwell this needs to be\nunder change control.\n\n231\n00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.190\nIt's not a front end configuration.\n\n232\n00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.600\nSo you must go through change control.\n\n233\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.270\nWe presented our steps for\nhow we would go and\n\n234\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.610\nupdate the currency each\ntime we got a request.\n\n235\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.370\nWhat steps we would follow to confirm\nthat it was successful, right.\n\n236\n00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.624\nAnd we also described our\nremediation plan, a back out plan,\n\n237\n00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:27.650\nif it wasn't successful.\n\n238\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.190\nWe took that to the authority,\nthe change authority,\n\n239\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.700\nchange advisory board it's called.\n\n240\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.480\nWhich we'll talk about that in a second.\n\n241\n00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.760\nWe took that to the change advisory board.\n\n242\n00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.690\nThey like the process and says okay,\nwe're gonna call that a standard change.\n\n243\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.770\nEvery time you need to do a currency\nchange, you don't have to come to us.\n\n244\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.170\nWe approve that one.\n\n245\n00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.810\nAgain, you still have a record of it.\n\n246\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.130\nYou still document it.\n\n247\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.730\nYou still know the change happened.\n\n248\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.560\nYou just skipping the step of waiting for\nthe approval.\n\n249\n00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.120\nThat's what a Standard change is.\n\n250\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.350\nSo it's for generally low risk changes.\n\n251\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.870\nAnd for changes that have a predefined\nset of steps already approved.\n\n252\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:09.720\nSo we have Emergency, we have Standard,\nand all others are Normal.\n\n253\n00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.260\nRight?\nNormal changes.\n\n254\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.020\nNow that doesn't mean that Normal doesn't\nhave varying degrees of complexity or\n\n255\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.000\nvarying degrees of urgency and\npriority, right?\n\n256\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.310\nThere can be variables among Normal.\n\n257\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.490\nBut ITIL is simply describing\nthree types of change.\n\n258\n00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.960\nIt makes it easier for\na test, anyway, right?\n\n259\n00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.067\nEmergency, Standard, and Normal.\n\n260\n00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:32.162\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n261\n00:13:33.895 --> 00:13:35.753\nAll right.\n\n262\n00:13:35.753 --> 00:13:43.066\nSo keeping the language straight here,\nchange is the actual thing you do, right.\n\n263\n00:13:43.066 --> 00:13:45.591\nVersus the request for that change,\n\n264\n00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:50.566\nwhich is obviously the way you formally\npresent, I want this to happen.\n\n265\n00:13:50.566 --> 00:13:54.755\nAnd then the change record is\nthe recording of all that,\n\n266\n00:13:54.755 --> 00:13:57.607\nright, including how it was tested,\n\n267\n00:13:57.607 --> 00:14:02.448\nhow it was implemented,\nyou have a full bedding of that record.\n\n268\n00:14:02.448 --> 00:14:04.020\nOkay.\n\n269\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.535\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:14:07.535 --> 00:14:09.674\nA change model.\n\n271\n00:14:09.674 --> 00:14:15.840\nI'd like to reintroduce the word,\nmodel, here, a change model,\n\n272\n00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.816\nbecause it's very powerful\nin the way we can reuse this\n\n273\n00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:25.645\nlearning when we learn\nsomething throughout ITIL.\n\n274\n00:14:25.645 --> 00:14:27.730\nITIL uses the word model a lot.\n\n275\n00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:33.920\nAnd it describes a predefined set of steps\nto handle a change in an agreed way.\n\n276\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.280\nIf you just take out the noun\nchange in both places and\n\n277\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.500\nput in the word incident, say.\n\n278\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:48.242\nIncident model equals a predefined steps\nto handle an incident in an agreed way.\n\n279\n00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:52.970\nYou could also do the same\nthing with problem.\n\n280\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.200\nA problem model, a predefined steps\nto handle a problem in an agreed way.\n\n281\n00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.660\nA request model.\n\n282\n00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.957\nRight.\nSo this word model can be conceptualized,\n\n283\n00:15:01.957 --> 00:15:03.887\nnot only for change, but for\n\n284\n00:15:03.887 --> 00:15:08.078\nthese other processes we'll\ndiscuss in the future, right?\n\n285\n00:15:08.078 --> 00:15:08.971\nAll right.\n\n286\n00:15:08.971 --> 00:15:13.570\nSo, it's the how you take on\na particular kind of change.\n\n287\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.180\nAs an example then,\nyou might have a change model defined for\n\n288\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.710\nhow you handle break-fix things.\n\n289\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:20.440\nRight.\n\n290\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.981\nMaybe they are fast tracked.\n\n291\n00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:25.359\nThey're not necessarily an emergency, but\nthey don't have to wait a month, right.\n\n292\n00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:26.580\nYou can get on those right away.\n\n293\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.440\nSo you have predefined steps for\nhow break-fix changes will be handled.\n\n294\n00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.200\nEnhancements, however\nwill get more complex, or\n\n295\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.180\nperhaps more impactful\nto the business user.\n\n296\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.745\nThey may need to learn something.\n\n297\n00:15:40.745 --> 00:15:43.299\nSo you have a different model for\nhow you handle enhancements.\n\n298\n00:15:43.299 --> 00:15:47.523\nMaybe have a model for\nbig changes versus small changes or\n\n299\n00:15:47.523 --> 00:15:53.244\ndata base changes versus server changes\nversus application changes Right,\n\n300\n00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:58.172\nso you can have models that describe\nhow you're gonna handle those\n\n301\n00:15:58.172 --> 00:16:01.770\ndifferent particular kinds of changes.\n\n302\n00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.690\nOkay, that's a change model.\n\n303\n00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.360\nSo it tells you the how.\n\n304\n00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.220\nIt also tells you the who, what,\nwhen, where and why, right?\n\n305\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.547\nSo a change model is going\nto include the steps for\n\n306\n00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:19.390\nhow to handle a particular kind of change,\nbut also who's the authority to approve,\n\n307\n00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.984\nwhen does it get approved,\nby whom, by when, etc.\n\n308\n00:16:22.984 --> 00:16:25.920\nSo there could be timing\nelements in there as well.\n\n309\n00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.110\nWe could relearn that model a little\nbit later when we talk about incident,\n\n310\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.170\nwhen we talk about problem and request.\n\n311\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.846\nI wanna kinda introduce it now as\na fairly useful word throughout\n\n312\n00:16:35.846 --> 00:16:38.019\nthe ITIL curriculum, okay.\n\n313\n00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:41.560\nNow remediation planning.\n\n314\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.540\nSometimes it's known as back out plan,\nright?\n\n315\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:53.480\nIt's the plan you create before\nyou realize you need it.\n\n316\n00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.000\nIn other words,\nbefore you implement it and\n\n317\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.430\nrealize it failed,\nthen you go start planning.\n\n318\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.840\nNo it's not that, it's the plan you come\nup with before it fails, so to speak.\n\n319\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.190\nWhat you're gonna do if the change fails,\nright?\n\n320\n00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:09.110\nSo remediation planning is a more\ngeneric way to treat this.\n\n321\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:13.710\nI like the word remediation planning\nversus back out planning because\n\n322\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:18.450\nthe remediation is not always back out or\nroll back.\n\n323\n00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:23.070\nSometimes the remediation plan is\ngoing to be something besides.\n\n324\n00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:24.468\n>> So it's more like a contingency.\n\n325\n00:17:24.468 --> 00:17:26.628\n>> It is.\n>> Than it is a back out.\n\n326\n00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:28.710\n>> Right, now back out is very common.\n\n327\n00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.650\nIf you do these seven things that we're\ngonna change and then the change causes\n\n328\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.060\nharm and it's a failure,\nyou just reverse those seven steps.\n\n329\n00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.890\nThat's a very common approach.\n\n330\n00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.940\nBut sometimes change is so complex that\nit's not as simple as reversing them,\n\n331\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.820\nyou have to have some\nother plan in place for\n\n332\n00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.650\nhow you're gonna deal with\nthat potential failure, right?\n\n333\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.360\nIt is something you do before\nyou realize it's failed, right?\n\n334\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.020\nThat's remediation planning.\n\n335\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.550\nAgain, you can equate it to back out\nplans and be conceptually correct.\n\n336\n00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:04.050\nJust note that ITIL gives it\na very generic nomenclature,\n\n337\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:12.470\nremediation planning as\nopposed to back out planning.\n\n338\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.108\nChange advisory board,\notherwise known as the CAB.\n\n339\n00:18:16.108 --> 00:18:21.620\nAnd the CAB abbreviation again is not\nwhat you're going to be tested on,\n\n340\n00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.250\nbut if you get used to using the word CAB,\n\n341\n00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.950\nyou might forget that it actually\nstands for Change Advisory Board.\n\n342\n00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.950\nSo just be careful, it's not the Change\nAuthorization Board, which in fact,\n\n343\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.275\nwould be kinda pretty good name for\nit because that's what it does.\n\n344\n00:18:33.275 --> 00:18:37.615\nIt authorizes those various milestones for\na change.\n\n345\n00:18:37.615 --> 00:18:41.765\nThey authorize the planning, they\nauthorize the building and the testing.\n\n346\n00:18:41.765 --> 00:18:45.915\nThey eventually authorize the deployment,\nright?\n\n347\n00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:48.750\nAnd closure as it turns out.\n\n348\n00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.720\nThe change advisory board is that\ngroup of people that get together\n\n349\n00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.920\non a regular basis and\ndetermine the authority\n\n350\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.650\nto move on with a change whether it be for\nplanning, whether it be for\n\n351\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.100\nbuilding and testing, whether it be for\nall those different milestones, right?\n\n352\n00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:12.030\nSo you're looking at existing records,\nyou're looking at potential\n\n353\n00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.608\nchanges coming out at their different\nstages of their life cycle so the CAB\n\n354\n00:19:16.608 --> 00:19:21.780\nmeaning is effectively the authorization\nbody, the one that gets it done, right?\n\n355\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.340\nSo who should show up?\n\n356\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.590\nYou can see kind of a list of\nwho shows up at a CAB meeting,\n\n357\n00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:30.690\nsomeone representing the technology,\nsomeone representing the service, right?\n\n358\n00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.790\nSomeone representing the processes\nunderneath the service.\n\n359\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.720\nSomeone representing the customers or\nthe business, right?\n\n360\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.730\nPerhaps the suppliers need to be involved.\n\n361\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.450\nIt can be rather elastic or\nflexible who shows up.\n\n362\n00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.880\nIt kinda depends on the topic of that cab\nor the topics for that particular meeting.\n\n363\n00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.420\nBut it's the regular meeting\n\n364\n00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.380\nthat gets together to manage\nthe workflow of change management.\n\n365\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.250\nAn emergency CAB however,\n\n366\n00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.950\nis a group of people that gets together as\nnecessary, it's not a standing meeting.\n\n367\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:08.680\nIn fact,\nit would be pretty bad situation if you\n\n368\n00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.820\njust had a standing emergency cab meeting\nthat was always there because you have so\n\n369\n00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.050\nmany emergencies, they just have to\nbe in place all the time, right?\n\n370\n00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.770\nIt should be something that only\ngets called for emergencies, right?\n\n371\n00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:19.750\nWhen those things happen.\n\n372\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.600\nAnd you remember an emergency change\nhas a very specific definition.\n\n373\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.060\nEmergency CAB is the group of people that\nget together to authorize those emergency\n\n374\n00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.000\nchanges, all right.\n\n375\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.830\nExcuse me, [COUGH].\n\n376\n00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.330\nLocal authority,\nthis is basically establishing perhaps\n\n377\n00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.170\na tiered set of CABs if you will.\n\n378\n00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.510\nYou see that in lower\nright-hand corner here?\n\n379\n00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.490\nThe CAB authorizes who can have\nlocal authority down three, so\n\n380\n00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.310\nyou can have layers of authority\nthroughout your organization.\n\n381\n00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:58.250\nHaving a monolithic CAB at the top of the\nIT organization is probably a nonstarter.\n\n382\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.600\nThere's too much change churning\nthroughout the organization to be able to\n\n383\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.720\nroll everything up to a single body.\n\n384\n00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.241\nSo you decentralize that control and have\nlocal authority at the appropriate places,\n\n385\n00:21:08.241 --> 00:21:11.609\nokay.\n\n386\n00:21:11.609 --> 00:21:16.290\nSo these next two slides describe a lot of\n\n387\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.445\nthe flow if you will on the activities\nin the change management.\n\n388\n00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:25.340\nThere is the recording of RFC,\n\n389\n00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.280\nthe recording of the request for change.\n\n390\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:34.020\nThe assessment of the change authorizing\nor rejecting it, passing it down,\n\n391\n00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.880\nauthorizing it to go down to release\nan appointment to do some planning,\n\n392\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.890\nauthorizing it to go down and\ndo some building and testing etc, right?\n\n393\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.340\nEventually managing the authority\n\n394\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.510\narm of this back and forth between\nchange and release management.\n\n395\n00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.680\nAnd this plays out in a graphical\nform in this workflow here.\n\n396\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.700\nI'm not gonna dive into\nthe minute detail on this slide.\n\n397\n00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.880\nI wanna point out a few things though,\nthat these are milestones,\n\n398\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.650\neach one of these boxes represents\nmilestones in the change lifecycle.\n\n399\n00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.390\nIn the lifecycle of a change, right?\n\n400\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.850\nAnd those life cycle milestones\nare recorded in the CMS.\n\n401\n00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.520\nYou see the CMS is represented over\nhere along the right margin here.\n\n402\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.310\nSo being able to have a tool set that\nallows you to easily record these\n\n403\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.820\nvarious milestones.\n\n404\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.800\nAnd the CMS having a record of these\nmilestones gives you the ability to\n\n405\n00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.495\nperhaps measure the performance of your\nchange management process over time.\n\n406\n00:22:36.495 --> 00:22:39.780\nLike how long did a languish\nbetween record and review?\n\n407\n00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.800\nHow long did it languish between\nreview and deploy, right?\n\n408\n00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.900\nIf you can kind of have\nthese times scales measured.\n\n409\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.240\nYou have a better chance of managing the\nquality of your change management process\n\n410\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.560\nitself, okay.\n\n411\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.690\nSo all the tangled web we weave,\nwhen we try to manage change.\n\n412\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.990\nAnd you could see that,\nthere's lots of figures and\n\n413\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.170\ntendrils here the change management\nas a process is trying to do.\n\n414\n00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:09.880\nIt interfaces with lots of different\naspects of the organization.\n\n415\n00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.530\nIncluding organizational\nchange management, right?\n\n416\n00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.320\nBusiness change processes, right?\n\n417\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.050\nSupplier management,\nservice asset configuration management.\n\n418\n00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:24.060\nChanges in those arenas are something\nthat change management is going to be\n\n419\n00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.470\nconcerned about.\n\n420\n00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.100\nAbout changes in the IT service\n\n421\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.650\nneed to be communicated to these\nvarious stakeholders as well, right?\n\n422\n00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:36.020\nIf you're changing from IIS, to Apache.\n\n423\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.920\nThere might be interface changes that\nthe business needs to know about.\n\n424\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.240\nFor instance, you're updating\nthe application functionality of it.\n\n425\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.107\nSo change management has lots of tendrils.\n\n426\n00:23:45.107 --> 00:23:49.725\nIt touches lots of different\naspects of other processes\n\n427\n00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:54.745\nacross The IT organization and\nthe business itself, okay?\n\n428\n00:23:54.745 --> 00:23:58.040\n[COUGH] Now moving on to release and\ndeployment.\n\n429\n00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.290\nWe've taught a bit about this\nalready in doing the comparison and\n\n430\n00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.670\nthe contrasting with change management.\n\n431\n00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.230\nWe necessarily got into some of the detail\nof release and deployment management.\n\n432\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.980\nOnce upon a time the answer to the\nquestion, about the purpose of releasing\n\n433\n00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.770\nemployment management the answer\nwas to ensure that business and\n\n434\n00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:22.120\ntechnical aspects of change\nare considered together.\n\n435\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:22.770\nAnd I like it.\n\n436\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.010\nIt's no longer the correct answer.\n\n437\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.220\nBut I like it in that it\nkinda sets the table for\n\n438\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:31.190\nthe scope of release management\nis not just technology, right.\n\n439\n00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:35.390\nSo, if you're sure, technology could\nbe changing behind the scenes, but\n\n440\n00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:40.720\nyou might be changing a CI that's not\nrelated to the technology directly, right.\n\n441\n00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.240\nIt may require re-training the users.\n\n442\n00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.810\nIt may require retraining\nthe service desk staff.\n\n443\n00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.270\nYou may need to update\na bunch of documents, right.\n\n444\n00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:54.114\nSo, the impact of a change is\nwide potentially, and release and\n\n445\n00:24:54.114 --> 00:24:58.240\ndeployment management is managing\nthat breath of the change as well,\n\n446\n00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:04.730\nincluding training, testing,\nvalidation and all those aspects and\n\n447\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:09.230\nthe good old record keeping of managing\nthese changes as they go through, okay?\n\n448\n00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:15.622\nSo, I mentioned these packages,\nI said that the change management gets ten\n\n449\n00:25:15.622 --> 00:25:20.232\nchanges handed to them, they kinda\npass them down to release deployment.\n\n450\n00:25:20.232 --> 00:25:21.582\nRelease and deployment says yeah,\n\n451\n00:25:21.582 --> 00:25:24.440\nthese five are break fix,\nwe're gonna put those in one package.\n\n452\n00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.377\nAnd we've got another five\nthat are enhancements,\n\n453\n00:25:26.377 --> 00:25:28.276\nwe're gonna put them in another package,\nright.\n\n454\n00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:32.049\nSo now you have two packages\nthat are discrete things for\n\n455\n00:25:32.049 --> 00:25:36.730\nchange management to consider\nauthorizing ongoing, right.\n\n456\n00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.870\nScheduling, planning,\ntesting will be done by these packages.\n\n457\n00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.294\nSo release and deployment management\nis managing these packages and\n\n458\n00:25:44.294 --> 00:25:46.130\nensuring their integrity, right.\n\n459\n00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.500\nDaniel, can you imagine if you got these,\n\n460\n00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.120\nthe reason you consider them as a whole,\nwe should think about this for a second.\n\n461\n00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:59.930\nIf you got five break fix things, right,\nwhy you should consider developing them\n\n462\n00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:05.250\nand testing them as an entire group\ninstead of just individually?\n\n463\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.300\n>> Well, they might be related.\n\n464\n00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.360\nNo, that would be it.\n\n465\n00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.840\nI would look and\nsee some sort of commonality between them.\n\n466\n00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.020\nThey're using the same system.\n\n467\n00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.168\nThey're using the same software.\n\n468\n00:26:12.168 --> 00:26:15.320\nIt's the same department maybe.\n\n469\n00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.310\n>> Right.\n>> Some sort of commonalities in there.\n\n470\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:22.965\nSomething, maybe this is a symptom of a\nlarger problem, and I'll treat it as such.\n\n471\n00:26:22.965 --> 00:26:23.565\n>> Very good.\n\n472\n00:26:23.565 --> 00:26:24.365\nVery good example.\n\n473\n00:26:24.365 --> 00:26:25.947\nGood answer, right.\n\n474\n00:26:25.947 --> 00:26:30.613\nAnd then you also test them as\na group because you don't want,\n\n475\n00:26:30.613 --> 00:26:34.291\nif you test one of the units,\nrelease unit one and\n\n476\n00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:39.160\nit is tests successfully and\nthen you implement two.\n\n477\n00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.910\nTwo might break one.\n\n478\n00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.540\nSo you need to test them as a unit as\nwell, or I should say as a package.\n\n479\n00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.850\nSo that also is maintaining\nintegrity as well.\n\n480\n00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.080\nGood examples, right.\n\n481\n00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.400\nOkay, so describing release policy.\n\n482\n00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.180\nAgain, having proper\ngovernance surround your\n\n483\n00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.580\nrelease management\nprocess is also critical.\n\n484\n00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.485\nAnd release policy can\ndeal with things like\n\n485\n00:27:01.485 --> 00:27:03.042\nhow many releases you'll have this year,\nright?\n\n486\n00:27:04.945 --> 00:27:06.965\nAnd when you can have major releases.\n\n487\n00:27:06.965 --> 00:27:09.578\nMaybe you've come up\nwith a policy that says,\n\n488\n00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:13.409\nwe will have a release every month,\na major release once a quarter.\n\n489\n00:27:13.409 --> 00:27:18.320\nA major release is described as anything\nwith an enhancement in it, right?\n\n490\n00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.700\nThese monthly ones can handle\na break fix things but\n\n491\n00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.480\nwe'll only do enhancements once a quarter,\nright?\n\n492\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.820\nSo, policy can drive those things.\n\n493\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.510\nIt's important to have such policies\nbecause it helps you set expectations\n\n494\n00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.900\neffectively.\n\n495\n00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.100\nSet governance effectively for\nwho's playing and\n\n496\n00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.050\nwho's asking for these changes to happen.\n\n497\n00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:42.770\nSo if you have policy in place and\na customer says, I want this enhancement,\n\n498\n00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.660\nI want it next week, you can point to the\npolicy and say, yeah, I realize you do,\n\n499\n00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:51.590\nbut we do enhancements every quarter,\nnot every week, right.\n\n500\n00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.210\nAnd if they're an important\nenough customer with enough\n\n501\n00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.740\ngravity in the organization,\nthey still might get it next week, but\n\n502\n00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.900\nat least you're managing by\nexception instead of by rule.\n\n503\n00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.540\nThe policy gives you some backing that\nsays here's how we're gonna do business,\n\n504\n00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.207\nand kind of set the expectations in there,\nright.\n\n505\n00:28:08.207 --> 00:28:12.390\nAnd then, we kinda circle back\nall the way back to release and\n\n506\n00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.430\ndeployment management as it\nrelates to change management.\n\n507\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.740\nThis is where we started.\n\n508\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.450\nThis compare and contrast, right?\n\n509\n00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.780\nThis is reinforcing these four phases of\nrelease and deployment a bit more detail.\n\n510\n00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.800\nSo there, and this is worth\ncommitting to memory to test takers,\n\n511\n00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.760\nis that there are four phases of\nrelease and deployment management.\n\n512\n00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.270\nThe planning piece,\nthe building and testing piece,\n\n513\n00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:38.800\nthe deployment piece, and\nthe review and closure, right?\n\n514\n00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:44.280\nAnd each of those are distinct and they\nare milestones that also get authorized,\n\n515\n00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.110\nbacked up at change management, right?\n\n516\n00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:50.082\nSo, they go in those phases and\ninto those iterations.\n\n517\n00:28:50.082 --> 00:28:53.690\nAgain, worth keeping in your memory bank,\nokay.\n\n518\n00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.740\nThat concludes service transition.\n\n519\n00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.180\nWe've gone through five processes in all.\n\n520\n00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.360\nThe mother hen, transition planning and\nsupport, followed by knowledge management,\n\n521\n00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.710\nthe one that creates this big ocean\nof knowledge and makes sense of it.\n\n522\n00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.310\nAnd then we had SACM, Service Asset\nConfiguration Management that enables\n\n523\n00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.490\nyou to control your configuration items.\n\n524\n00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:17.930\nThe assets you care to peak under control.\n\n525\n00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.800\nYou can store them in a configuration\nmanagement system, right?\n\n526\n00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.581\nAnd that configuration management\nsystem consists of CMDBs,\n\n527\n00:29:25.581 --> 00:29:28.512\nConfigurement Management Databases, right.\n\n528\n00:29:28.512 --> 00:29:32.608\nAnd then we turn to change management and\nrelease deployment management and\n\n529\n00:29:32.608 --> 00:29:35.233\nhow they have an iterative\nrelationship back and\n\n530\n00:29:35.233 --> 00:29:39.201\nforth through the life cycle of a change,\nso that you can have authority,\n\n531\n00:29:39.201 --> 00:29:43.234\naccountability, and change management and\nyou can have the execution and\n\n532\n00:29:43.234 --> 00:29:47.430\nthe responsibility of delivering and\nreleasing deployment.\n\n533\n00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.660\nThat concludes the transition portion.\n\n534\n00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.360\n>> Obviously a lot of very great\ninformation here in transition, so\n\n535\n00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.320\nwhy we took two parts to cover it.\n\n536\n00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.330\nAnd here specifically, it really hit\nhome for me with change management and\n\n537\n00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.780\nrelease management cuz I've been\n\n538\n00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.370\nintimately involved with those\nprocesses in my IT career.\n\n539\n00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.810\nI'm sure if you guys are in IT or\n\n540\n00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:10.190\nin any kind of management as well, you\nare going to be involve in this process.\n\n541\n00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:11.110\nThis is the bread and\n\n542\n00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:15.850\nbutter of making your way through that,\nmaking sure it's efficient and effective.\n\n543\n00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.060\nThat's what we wanna do.\n\n544\n00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.040\nGreat job today, Terry, we appreciate\nyour knowledge on that subject.\n\n545\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.860\nBut, looking at the clock,\nlooks like it's time for us to expire for\n\n546\n00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.540\nthis episode as well.\n\n547\n00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.110\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n548\n00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.550\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n549\n00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.410\n>> And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n550\n00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.422\n>>

00:00:16.040\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.220\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.630\nAnd in today's episode, we continue\non with more on our ITIL foundations.\n\n6\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.530\nI was gonna say fundamentals,\nbut it's foundations.\n\n7\n00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.070\n>> It's fun, though.\n\n8\n00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.940\n>> It is fun.\n\n9\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.130\nWe put the fun in the fundamentals,\nthat's what we do here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.570\nAnd joining me my combat in arms here,\nmy good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.460\nTerry, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.020\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.880\n>> Very good to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.170\nThanks so much, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.500\nYou recall in previous episodes that\nwe have done sort of a strategy,\n\n16\n00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.890\nthe life cycle stage that decides\nwhich services should be offered and\n\n17\n00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.702\nmake sure they're funded.\n\n18\n00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:52.730\nAnd then we went to service design that\ndesigns the service, including all\n\n19\n00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.090\nthe parameters around the service for\nprocess, people, products and partners.\n\n20\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.690\nAnd then we went to service transition.\n\n21\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.670\nWe just finished those episodes up where\nwe talk about taking that service design\n\n22\n00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.317\npackage down in the transition.\n\n23\n00:01:06.317 --> 00:01:10.938\nAnd making it live, come to life,\nmaking the service actually viable,\n\n24\n00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:12.928\nfully vetted, fully tested.\n\n25\n00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:15.731\nAnd then presenting it\nto service operations so\n\n26\n00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:18.140\nthe customers can start using it.\n\n27\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.670\nAnd that's where we are right\nnow in service operations.\n\n28\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.379\nThe topics that we will be covering,\nas you can see on your screen now.\n\n29\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.640\nIt include, as we've done before, the\noverall value of the life cycle stage at\n\n30\n00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.848\nlarge, and then we'll get into specific\nconcepts and vocabulary checks again.\n\n31\n00:01:34.848 --> 00:01:38.620\nAnd then we'll follow\ninto specific processes,\n\n32\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.530\nwe have five processes in scope.\n\n33\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.940\nIncident, problem, event, request\nfulfillment, and access management.\n\n34\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.430\nAnd we also have some functions, the\nfunctions would be in the next episode.\n\n35\n00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.280\nWe hope to get through\nthese five processes\n\n36\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.950\nin this episode and move forward.\n\n37\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.000\nSo a lot to learn, let's dig in.\n\n38\n00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.210\nSo service operations is\nsometimes called production.\n\n39\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.547\nWhen something goes into production or the\nlive environment, that's where we are now,\n\n40\n00:02:04.547 --> 00:02:05.800\nin service operations.\n\n41\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.610\nThat's when the service is\nactually delivered to customers.\n\n42\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.400\nSo that's when customers start\nreally realizing the value\n\n43\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.420\nthat the service was intended to provide.\n\n44\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.980\nYou need to provide customer\nsatisfaction at this point,\n\n45\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.860\njust make sure you're very responsive.\n\n46\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.100\nYou have your service reviews with\nthe customers at this point, etcetera.\n\n47\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.250\nSo this is where the rubber meets the road\nin ITIL, where all the fruits of your\n\n48\n00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.270\nlabor in strategy, design, transition,\nare brought forward to the customer.\n\n49\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.820\nSo it includes, in terms of scope,\nit includes the services themselves, and\n\n50\n00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.790\nall the processes in the back\nend that make that possible.\n\n51\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.440\nThe people that make that possible,\nthe technology that makes that possible.\n\n52\n00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.221\nManaging all those different resources,\nthose different assets if you will,\n\n53\n00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:59.019\nresources and capabilities in operations\nis the scope of service operations.\n\n54\n00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.690\nOkay, the business value, this is\nwhere it's actually delivered, right?\n\n55\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.900\nThis is where value of\nthe service is actually promised,\n\n56\n00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.870\nokay, So to pick up some words here.\n\n57\n00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.720\nAgain, we got a good amount of vocabulary\nand some concepts to cover here.\n\n58\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.987\n>> Day without keywords and definitions\nand ITIL's like a day without sunshine,\n\n59\n00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:22.580\nright [LAUGH]?\n\n60\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.572\n>> Indeed, it's a lot about the language,\n\n61\n00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:27.130\nwanted to pick up some of\nthese key things, right.\n\n62\n00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.237\nYou've certainly heard\nthe term priority before.\n\n63\n00:03:30.237 --> 00:03:39.400\nVery specifically, ITIL maps priority to\nthe intersection of urgency and impact.\n\n64\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.832\nAnd you'll see in some of the examples\ndown here in the lower left hand corner,\n\n65\n00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:44.499\nor right hand corner for that matter.\n\n66\n00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:48.820\nThe ways you could potentially\nquantify those two aspects.\n\n67\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.920\nSo, you could have something that's\nvery high impact and rated a 3.\n\n68\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.820\nAnd something that's very high urgency,\nand these happen quickly when rated a 3.\n\n69\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.470\nTherefore, its overall priority\nwould be up high, right?\n\n70\n00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.679\nYou get those kinda things, right?\n\n71\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.040\nKind of mixed up the numbers there,\n\n72\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.790\nactually high priority is 1,\na low priority being 3.\n\n73\n00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.490\nRight, or you could use,\n\n74\n00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.140\nyou can see in the lower left, just\ntrying to find these other characters.\n\n75\n00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.560\nCritical, high, medium, low,\nyou could have different factors.\n\n76\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.102\nThe overarching theme here, again ITIL\nis not prescriptive in this regard.\n\n77\n00:04:23.102 --> 00:04:26.751\nBut they're suggesting you should have\na regimented approach to how you assign\n\n78\n00:04:26.751 --> 00:04:27.410\npriorities.\n\n79\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.600\nSo if you're taking on work, like an\nincident, a user calls the service desk.\n\n80\n00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.230\nHave a methodical approach\nto assessing priority, and\n\n81\n00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.180\nthat approach is again at the intersection\nof urgency and priority, all right.\n\n82\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.700\nSome other key words and\nunderstandings here.\n\n83\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.950\nAn event, a change of state\nthat has significance for\n\n84\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.440\nthe management of a configuration item or\nan IT service.\n\n85\n00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.330\nAnd the notification of that\n\n86\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.150\nis done automatically through some\nsort of monitoring tool, right?\n\n87\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.580\nSo as an example, is it an event\nwhen the disk gets 75% full?\n\n88\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:11.945\nYeah, you might want to capture that.\n\n89\n00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:15.980\nSend the notification to\na responsible party so\n\n90\n00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.550\nthat they can get in front of that issue,\nthat event.\n\n91\n00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.820\nAnd keep it from becoming 100% full,\nright?\n\n92\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.891\nGet rid of some log files, do something,\nadd more disk space, etcetera.\n\n93\n00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:30.750\nSo an event is something that's\nautomatically triggered.\n\n94\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.380\nWe'll talk about event\nmanagement a little bit,\n\n95\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.800\nget into some more examples of what\nthe types of events there are, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.410\nBut the detection of that\nparticular state is automated.\n\n97\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.010\nNow alert is simply the notification\nbased on that event.\n\n98\n00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.120\nAn incident is an unexpected interruption\nor reduction in IT service or\n\n99\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.909\nthe quality of a service.\n\n100\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.015\nA failure of a CI or\n\n101\n00:05:55.015 --> 00:06:00.680\nindication that it's going to fail soon\ncould be an incident as well, right.\n\n102\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.210\nWe'll get in some details about some\nincidents when we talk about incident\n\n103\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.930\nmanagement in a little bit.\n\n104\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.960\nA problem is the underlying\ncause of one or more incidents.\n\n105\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.210\nIt's what's at the root of these issues.\n\n106\n00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.040\nAnd you're trying to eliminate the root\ncause of these issues as they come up.\n\n107\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.542\nNow again, here's ITIL, a good wise\nlibrarian's taking words that we've\n\n108\n00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:27.502\nused in our life, right, and\ngiving them very specific meanings.\n\n109\n00:06:27.502 --> 00:06:30.288\nYou might have used these same\nwords in your IT existence, right,\n\n110\n00:06:30.288 --> 00:06:31.590\nin your IT departments.\n\n111\n00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.540\nAnd they may have meanings\nin your organization.\n\n112\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.915\nThat's totally fine, you don't necessarily\nhave to rewrite your dictionary.\n\n113\n00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:38.116\nBut as a test taker,\n\n114\n00:06:38.116 --> 00:06:42.640\nyou certainly gotta get these things\nfiled away in the ITIL way, right?\n\n115\n00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.620\nKnow what an event is in ITIL terms.\n\n116\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.870\nIt's not cake and ice cream.\n\n117\n00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.100\nIt's a change of state, right?\n\n118\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.670\nKnow what an incident is in ITIL terms.\n\n119\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.240\nAnd know what a problem is.\n\n120\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.290\nYou got a problem with that, Daniel?\n\n121\n00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.780\n>> I have no problem with that.\n\n122\n00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.395\nIt is nature of the beast, right?\n\n123\n00:06:57.395 --> 00:07:01.865\nEverybody's got their own language\nsets and when you jump into really\n\n124\n00:07:01.865 --> 00:07:06.799\nan environment or a culture, even,\nif you want to speak of it in those terms.\n\n125\n00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:09.914\nYou've gotta learn the lingo and\nsometimes they conflict.\n\n126\n00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:12.278\nAnd it's just part of our job\nabout having to discern, okay,\n\n127\n00:07:12.278 --> 00:07:13.652\nwell you're speaking about ITIL.\n\n128\n00:07:13.652 --> 00:07:16.767\nSo event in this situation means this,\nand not cake and\n\n129\n00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:20.000\nice cream or\nwhatever I might think it means.\n\n130\n00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.750\n>> Exactly.\n\n131\n00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.611\nSo key in on these words as you review for\nthe exam.\n\n132\n00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:28.790\nThe practice exams you get access to will\ncertainly key in on these words as well.\n\n133\n00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.387\nIt's gonna be a memorization exercise.\n\n134\n00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:33.610\nSimple as that, and more words to come.\n\n135\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:40.490\nA workaround, it's a temporary means to\nrestore service or parts of a service.\n\n136\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.330\n>> That we leave continually forever\nuntil it breaks again [LAUGH].\n\n137\n00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.670\n>> Well sometimes that does happen.\n\n138\n00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.816\nSometimes workarounds last\na good long time, right?\n\n139\n00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:47.732\n>> Yeah they do.\n\n140\n00:07:47.732 --> 00:07:48.972\n>> They can be simple sometimes.\n\n141\n00:07:48.972 --> 00:07:53.770\nA user calls a service desk and\nsays I can't print to printer A.\n\n142\n00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.380\nWhat might a workaround be for that?\n\n143\n00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.180\n>> Print to printer B.\n\n144\n00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:57.845\n>> Exactly.\n\n145\n00:07:57.845 --> 00:08:00.905\nSo you still wanna fix printer A and\nget it back up, but\n\n146\n00:08:00.905 --> 00:08:03.495\nthe workaround is just\ngo to get to printer B.\n\n147\n00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:06.284\nThe fact that printer B happens to be\nthree miles down the road in another\n\n148\n00:08:06.284 --> 00:08:07.036\nbuilding, well.\n\n149\n00:08:07.036 --> 00:08:08.051\n>> That sounds like a personal problem.\n\n150\n00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:10.470\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly, that's right.\n\n151\n00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.570\nObviously, we jest there.\n\n152\n00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.381\nWorkaround should be something that\nalso at least temporarily satisfies\n\n153\n00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:18.031\nthe customer and\nuser in a meaningful way, right?\n\n154\n00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:20.540\nBut that is what workarounds are about,\nright?\n\n155\n00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:26.470\nWorkarounds for problems are documented on\nwhat's called a Known Error Record, right.\n\n156\n00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.040\nAnd hopefully you keep that\nKnown Error Record in a database, so\n\n157\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.397\ncall it a Known Error database, something\nelse we'll talk about very shortly, right.\n\n158\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.520\nService Requests.\n\n159\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.600\nThese could be simple things.\n\n160\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.614\nThey typically are simple and\nrepeatable type of requests\n\n161\n00:08:45.614 --> 00:08:51.970\nthat can follow a particular workflow and\nsatisfy the person making that request.\n\n162\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.550\nSuch as I need a new headset, right?\n\n163\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.756\nSo you either go online and\nfind an online automated tool,\n\n164\n00:08:58.756 --> 00:09:01.110\nworkflow tool that lets\nyou request the headset.\n\n165\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:07.140\nPerhaps there's a management approval part\nof that work flow that gets approved,\n\n166\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.800\nand then you get your headset.\n\n167\n00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.520\nMaybe some things are just,\nyou don't have to get approval for,\n\n168\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.200\nlike I need a new mouse, or I need a new\nkeyboard, or those types of things.\n\n169\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.480\nIt could be more elaborate.\n\n170\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.380\nService Requests could be quite large too.\n\n171\n00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.660\nI mentioned one briefly earlier about\nour Learning Management Service.\n\n172\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.630\nIt included a request to convert\n\n173\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.170\ninstructor led training\nto e-learning modules.\n\n174\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.539\nSomething that could be just streamed\nonline instead of going to a course and\n\n175\n00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:35.380\nlooking at an instructor.\n\n176\n00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.350\nSo doing that kind of conversion\nfrom instructor lead to e-learning\n\n177\n00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.700\nwas a service.\n\n178\n00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.176\nThat's a bit more complicated, right?\n\n179\n00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:45.800\nIt takes a little bit longer, but\nit still could be standardized into\n\n180\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.670\na request model where there is a workflow\nof approval and funding etc, right?\n\n181\n00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.970\nIt also could be a request for\ninformation.\n\n182\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.500\nIt's interesting that\ncommunications has shown up here\n\n183\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.860\nin that communications is important\nthroughout all the life cycle stages.\n\n184\n00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.030\nIt's just as important for\n\n185\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.700\nservice strategy processes\nto communicate downstream.\n\n186\n00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.280\nIt's important for service design to\ncommunicate the service strategy, etc.\n\n187\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.370\nCommunication's important.\n\n188\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.710\nSome major themes about communications\nthat I highlight that may help you out on\n\n189\n00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:24.560\nthe exam is that communication should be\ninclusive of the necessary stakeholders.\n\n190\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.760\nCommunication should be tailored\ntowards specific types of stakeholders.\n\n191\n00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.470\nYou might talk to IT people\nabout a problem you're having or\n\n192\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.730\nan incident you're having differently\nthan you talk to a customer about\n\n193\n00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.040\nthe problems or\nincidents that you're dealing with right?\n\n194\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.290\nSo tailoring the communications\ntoward the right audience.\n\n195\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.360\nMake sure there's a two-way flow and\nmake sure the communication lines are open\n\n196\n00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.810\nacross all the life cycle stages\nare the major themes there, okay.\n\n197\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.330\nAll right, so\na bunch of key concepts and words.\n\n198\n00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.160\nAnd now just kind of a brief\nroad map of the processes we're\n\n199\n00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.920\ngoing to be talking about.\n\n200\n00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.512\nYou see we got incident,\nproblem, event request, and\n\n201\n00:10:59.512 --> 00:11:01.560\naccess management coming up here.\n\n202\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.720\nIn that order, we'll talk about those.\n\n203\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.890\nSo what is an incident?\n\n204\n00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.610\nLet's throw out some things,\nperhaps potentially is an incident.\n\n205\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.950\nA user calls and says,\nI can't find the submit button.\n\n206\n00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.770\nWhat do you think?\n\n207\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.830\nIs that an incident?\n\n208\n00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.820\n>> Is than an incident?\n\n209\n00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.880\nI mean, I guess it could be.\n\n210\n00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.350\nWe were talking about how do we\ndefine the word incident within\n\n211\n00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.335\nthe framework of ITIL.\n\n212\n00:11:23.335 --> 00:11:26.220\n>> Right.\n>> So based off of that,\n\n213\n00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.420\nI'm not 100% positive on what that is\nat this point, cuz it's new to me.\n\n214\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.670\n>> Right.\n>> So I couldn't answer that question.\n\n215\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.490\n>> So yeah, Daniel,\nthat's actually a pretty good point there,\n\n216\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.880\nis that it really kinda depends.\n\n217\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.060\nThere's no real right answer\nto this question, because in\n\n218\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.810\na puritanical sense that user saying\nI can't find the submit button, for\n\n219\n00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.670\nthat user,\nservice operation is not normal, right?\n\n220\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.183\nBut this could get into\nthe whole category of what we,\n\n221\n00:11:53.183 --> 00:11:56.040\nwell ID10T errors, Pip-cack and-\n>> And\n\n222\n00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.775\nmy favorite the picnic area, which is\nproblem in chair, not in computer.\n\n223\n00:12:00.775 --> 00:12:03.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> So I guess we shouldn't be casting so\n\n224\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.670\nmany aspersions on the users, because\nafter all users are the gods in ITIL, so\n\n225\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.370\nlet's not do that too much longer.\n\n226\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.230\nBut the point is that you\nneed to decide what this is,\n\n227\n00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.014\nis that a request for information\nas opposed to an incident, right.\n\n228\n00:12:16.014 --> 00:12:22.170\nIs it an ID10T error or etc,\nis it just a user issue, right?\n\n229\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.850\nYou can choose to do that, but you need\nto decide what that really is, right?\n\n230\n00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.190\nBut generally speaking\nwhat an incident is,\n\n231\n00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.550\nis when service has either already\nbeen implicated, or downgraded,\n\n232\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.540\nor there's slow performance and\nthe users are noticing it.\n\n233\n00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.950\nOr you notice a trend in your monitoring.\n\n234\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.920\nYou're keeping track of these things and\nthey're starting to slide, and\n\n235\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.162\nyou want to raise\nan incident before it does.\n\n236\n00:12:44.162 --> 00:12:47.820\nAnd if you consider some of\nthe monitoring tools we talked about\n\n237\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.980\nearlier in Event Management, or\nwe talked about disk is 75% full.\n\n238\n00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.530\nIf you send out that notification and you\nwant someone to work, then go ahead and\n\n239\n00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.590\ncreate an incident so that you can get\nsomeone to work on that disk space so\n\n240\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.360\nit doesn't fall over and get completely\nfull, that kind of thing right?\n\n241\n00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.520\nSo coming up with standardized methods for\ndealing with these types of issues\n\n242\n00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.970\nis the purpose of Incident Management and\nresolving them quickly.\n\n243\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:19.320\nSo when you consider Incident Management\nyou're also considering\n\n244\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.470\nthis essence of urgency, time scales.\n\n245\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.130\nYou want to restore service quickly,\nright?\n\n246\n00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.990\nSo timescales, that means quite a bit.\n\n247\n00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.800\nIt means how fast you're able to do it,\nbut it also means how fast\n\n248\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.660\nany given incident lingers in one person's\nworkload and in another person's.\n\n249\n00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.230\nLike maybe it goes to the network team,\nthey look at it for awhile and\n\n250\n00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.350\nsay, it's not a network issue,\n\n251\n00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.660\nthey send it to the server team and\nthey say, no it's not a server issue.\n\n252\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.647\nIf you're able to keep up to those\ntimescales, have a good tool set that can\n\n253\n00:13:48.647 --> 00:13:53.872\nmonitor just how this incident lives\nin its various stages of investigation,\n\n254\n00:13:53.872 --> 00:13:57.450\nis a big part of\nIncident Management as well, right.\n\n255\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.330\nYou've heard of the word,\nchange model, earlier.\n\n256\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:05.190\nA change model was predefined steps for\nhandling particular kind of change.\n\n257\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.360\nAnd I mentioned there that you could\njust take out the noun, change,\n\n258\n00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.880\nand throw in incident.\n\n259\n00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.760\nHere it is again.\n\n260\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.480\nIncident model, predefined steps for\n\n261\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.760\nhandling a particular type of incident,\nright.\n\n262\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:23.056\nIf a Senior Vice President calls and says,\nI can't find the submit button, right?\n\n263\n00:14:23.056 --> 00:14:26.250\nDo you want to put that Senior Vice\nPresident on hold and let him wait for\n\n264\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.550\ntwo days to investigate the submit button?\n\n265\n00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.440\nYou might treat executive incidents\na little bit differently than rank and\n\n266\n00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.480\nfile incidents, right?\n\n267\n00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.260\nSo would have an incident model for\n\n268\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.690\nexecutives as opposed to just\nthose of the rank and file.\n\n269\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.040\nAs an example-\n>> When you said model,\n\n270\n00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.500\nI think of when I was a kid, I built\nlittle model cars and airplanes and\n\n271\n00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.090\nthings of that nature.\n\n272\n00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.660\nAnd there was a set of instructions that\nsaid here's how you build this model.\n\n273\n00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.220\n>> That's right.\n>> And\n\n274\n00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.500\nthat's basically what we're talking about.\n\n275\n00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.310\nHere's a platform,\nmaybe it's a C-level person.\n\n276\n00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.690\nMaybe it's like said, rank and\nfile, but each has their own\n\n277\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.430\nset of predetermined instructions for\nhow to deal with an incident.\n\n278\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.480\n>> Exactly.\n\n279\n00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.690\nAnd it could be based on\nif it has the symptoms\n\n280\n00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.890\nthe way you deal with it is\nthat you send it to this team.\n\n281\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.270\nIf it as these kinds of symptoms,\nyou send it to that team.\n\n282\n00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.020\nSo it's not necessarily\nhierarchy of urgency,\n\n283\n00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.080\nit could be a way to determine\nhow to route, right?\n\n284\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.640\nYour incident models could also\npre-define those types of decisions.\n\n285\n00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.310\nAgain, you're trying to build in\nefficiencies and quick decision making,\n\n286\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.470\nparticularly at the service desk level so\nthat they can handle these effectively.\n\n287\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.660\n>> The service desk that I worked\nat before had that as well.\n\n288\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.330\nIt was, did the phone ring?\n\n289\n00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.307\nYes, route to Daniel.\n\n290\n00:15:35.307 --> 00:15:38.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was their model, yeah.\n\n291\n00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.760\nDid the phone ring, route to Daniel.\n\n292\n00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.720\n>> All right, well that happens, but.\n\n293\n00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.440\nAll right, in fact we see the word\nMajor Incident here on the screen now.\n\n294\n00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.156\nA major incident, as the name implies,\nsomething big has happened, right?\n\n295\n00:15:51.156 --> 00:15:54.770\nIt's either falling down, or\nit's gonna fall down right?\n\n296\n00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.279\nThat's what a major incident is.\n\n297\n00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.276\nThey're gonna get special attention.\n\n298\n00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:02.359\nAnd for the team I use to work on,\nwe called it the SWAT team,\n\n299\n00:16:02.359 --> 00:16:04.290\nSpecial Weapons And Tactics.\n\n300\n00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:08.880\nYou called the SWAT team together and they\nhad representatives from network servers,\n\n301\n00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.220\ndatabases, application,\nthe vendors, right?\n\n302\n00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.310\nAnd we had pre-designed call lists.\n\n303\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:20.420\nSo if your pager rang or\nyou got a text message for\n\n304\n00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.610\na service you were accountable for or\naccountable to, then you responded.\n\n305\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.000\nYou joined the phone bridge.\n\n306\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.653\nYou got on the line and\nwe started managing it.\n\n307\n00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:32.593\nSo major incidents have their\nown separate path of urgency and\n\n308\n00:16:32.593 --> 00:16:36.290\nmembers to participate, right.\n\n309\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.610\nAnd then you see here some incident\nstatus tracking, these are just examples.\n\n310\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.200\nYou know the ticket is open, the incident\nis open, it's in progress, it's resolved,\n\n311\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.400\nit's closed.\n\n312\n00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.880\nHave you heard of other ones?\n\n313\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.390\nPerhaps you have in your own space.\n\n314\n00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.080\nWhat about you Daniel?\n\n315\n00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.770\nHave you heard of other status\nindicators that a ticket might have?\n\n316\n00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.560\n>> No that was basically what we had.\n\n317\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.225\nIt was either open or closed is\nbasically what we had, very simplistic\n\n318\n00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:03.534\n>> Sure and it's very effective,\n\n319\n00:17:03.534 --> 00:17:05.245\nyou don't have to overcomplicate this.\n\n320\n00:17:05.245 --> 00:17:09.340\nI've seen some folks say,\nwaiting on user, right?\n\n321\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.220\nBecause you're getting that feedback from\nthe user to say yes, we can close this.\n\n322\n00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.270\nAnd they don't call back for three weeks.\n\n323\n00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.350\nSo you kinda,\n\n324\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.590\nin a way you're kinda stopping the clock\nbecause you're waiting on the user, right.\n\n325\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.860\nThere could be other ones like that\nwhere you just have it on hold.\n\n326\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.050\n>> Those are great because it makes\nthem look like you're working,\n\n327\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.910\ncuz you just call them\nonce every couple of days.\n\n328\n00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:28.900\nHow's that going for you?\n\n329\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.732\nStill waiting on that?\n\n330\n00:17:29.732 --> 00:17:30.260\nGreat.\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n331\n00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.950\n>> You type it into your project manager,\ngood to go.\n\n332\n00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.660\n>> I don't work today, that's right.\n\n333\n00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.984\n>> Bak to YouTube.\n\n334\n00:17:35.984 --> 00:17:38.560\n[LAUGH] I kid.\n\n335\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.488\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah of course you do,\nyou're ultimate professional.\n\n336\n00:17:41.488 --> 00:17:42.010\n>> That's right.\n\n337\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:42.510\n>> That's right.\n\n338\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:49.560\nAll right, the process flow for\nincident management,\n\n339\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.840\nas you can see, is big enough that\nit spans a couple of pages here.\n\n340\n00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.830\nWe're gonna look at this in some detail.\n\n341\n00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.870\nSo let's get used to looking at this for\na bit.\n\n342\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.280\nBut first, the highlights,\nthe big picture.\n\n343\n00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.220\nNotice that an incident can be\ntriggered from multiple places.\n\n344\n00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.430\nEvent management could certainly be one,\nright?\n\n345\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.170\nLike I said, you get an event,\n\n346\n00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.960\na notification that says\nthe disk is 75% full.\n\n347\n00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.320\nWell you want to respond to that, and\n\n348\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.090\nyou want to get to it before it gets 100%\nfull, so that can trigger an incident.\n\n349\n00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.210\nYou can have a web interface\nthat users can interact with.\n\n350\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.170\nPhone calls, emails, chat rooms\nare pretty popular now as well, right?\n\n351\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.010\nSo it can be triggered by multiple means\n\n352\n00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.310\nthat the incident management\nprocess gets started, right.\n\n353\n00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.740\nAnd once it gets started, you gotta ask\nyourself, is it really an incident?\n\n354\n00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.040\nIs this a request, perhaps?\n\n355\n00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.470\nIs it that ID10T error like we\ntalked about earlier, right?\n\n356\n00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.090\nIs it simply a request for information?\n\n357\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.420\nIf it's a request for information,\n\n358\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.290\nobviously it's gonna go to some\nother process as you can see here.\n\n359\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.310\nIt's gonna go get kicked out to another\nprocess like request fulfillment.\n\n360\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:51.600\nBut if it is an incident,\nyou're gonna log this thing, right.\n\n361\n00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.066\nSo if you were to be asked a question,\nhypothetically,\n\n362\n00:18:55.066 --> 00:19:00.085\nwhat's the proper order of the activities\nin incident management, you'd want\n\n363\n00:19:00.085 --> 00:19:05.800\nto see that incident identification and\nincident logging early and together.\n\n364\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.160\nIf you can identify it as an incident,\nget it logged.\n\n365\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.040\nThe primary purpose for\n\n366\n00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.360\nlogging incidents is to have a record\nthat it actually happened, right.\n\n367\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.000\nIf you just take a call and troubleshoot\nit all and then hang up and don't record\n\n368\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.770\nit, you're missing an opportunity to\nidentify your work, as Daniel just said.\n\n369\n00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.320\nI did some work today, right.\n\n370\n00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.690\nBut it also limits invisible work.\n\n371\n00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:29.541\nIf you get 50 calls that you don't record,\nall of a sudden you have invisible work.\n\n372\n00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:32.570\nAnd invisible work can kill an IT\norganization cuz you don't even know it's\n\n373\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.270\nhappening, right?\n\n374\n00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.510\nYou don't resource properly, etc.\n\n375\n00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.458\nOkay, another tell-tale sign,\nyou got incident categorization and\n\n376\n00:19:39.458 --> 00:19:41.170\nprioritization.\n\n377\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.940\nEventually you might ask the question,\nis this a major incident?\n\n378\n00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.930\nOf course if it's a major incident,\nit's gonna go out to that special process.\n\n379\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.630\nLike I said we called ours\nthe SWAT process, right.\n\n380\n00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.640\nWhatever you call it,\n\n381\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.440\nit's that special major incident\nprocess that you kick it out to.\n\n382\n00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.840\nIf it's not a major incident,\n\n383\n00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.090\nthen you're gonna be asking this\nquestion of initial diagnosis.\n\n384\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.830\nNow, it's kind of an unfortunate\nbreak in the slide, but\n\n385\n00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.970\nI want you to put two things together.\n\n386\n00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:09.550\nInitial diagnosis, and\nthe question, escalation needed.\n\n387\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.940\nEffectively incident diagnosis is\ntrying to answer the question,\n\n388\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.200\nis escalation needed, right.\n\n389\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.597\nSo again if you had to pick\nthis out on and exam question,\n\n390\n00:20:18.597 --> 00:20:23.310\nyou're gonna see incident identification\nand logging early and together.\n\n391\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.490\nAnother thing that you'll see close\ntogether will be initial diagnosis,\n\n392\n00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.000\nwhich happens on the previous slide here.\n\n393\n00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.400\nAnd escalation needed, the question.\n\n394\n00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.460\nThey go together as well.\n\n395\n00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.930\nBecause initial diagnosis is\ntrying to answer this question.\n\n396\n00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.930\nNow one thing I've learned\nas a sideline note\n\n397\n00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.062\nfrom this particular slide is that\nflowcharts like this have a difficult time\n\n398\n00:20:48.062 --> 00:20:53.040\nrendering paths that can both be active.\n\n399\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.630\nIn other words,\nthese aren't mutually exclusive paths.\n\n400\n00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.040\nYou could have a functional escalation and\na hierarchic escalation.\n\n401\n00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.298\nAnd all this back and forth in the flow\nchart is really trying to show that.\n\n402\n00:21:05.298 --> 00:21:07.210\nIn effect what it means\nis both are possible,\n\n403\n00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.320\nthey're not mutually exclusive, right?\n\n404\n00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.760\nSo let's talk about what these escalations\nare, functional escalation and\n\n405\n00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.270\na hierarchic escalation.\n\n406\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:20.190\nA functional escalation is, you're\ngonna send it to the network team, or\n\n407\n00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.120\nsend it to the server team or\nthe database team.\n\n408\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.710\nThat's the functional escalation.\n\n409\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.050\nA hierarchic escalation is sending\nit up the chain of command.\n\n410\n00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.350\nYou're notifying management.\n\n411\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.500\nDaniel, why would you want to notify\nmanagement about an incident?\n\n412\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.790\n>> Because it might be\neither a legal thing, or\n\n413\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.120\nsomething that affects\nbusiness continuity.\n\n414\n00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.200\nAnything that's gonna be a major\neffect on the business itself,\n\n415\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.450\nyou want to get management involved.\n\n416\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:46.510\n>> Yes, so\n\n417\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.691\nthey can light the appropriate fires under\nthe appropriate chairs for instance.\n\n418\n00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:52.690\nOr so\nthat management is not blind sided so\n\n419\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.622\nthat your IT manager is not blind\nsided by a business manager.\n\n420\n00:21:56.622 --> 00:21:58.210\nThat says, hey,\ndid you know we had a hiccup today in\n\n421\n00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.280\nthe financial management system?\n\n422\n00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.060\nAnd you're looking there and\nsaid no, I didn't know that, right?\n\n423\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.988\nSo it gives that IT manager\nthe information he needs to have\n\n424\n00:22:04.988 --> 00:22:09.990\nan intelligent conversation should he be\nsidewaysed in the hallway sometime, right.\n\n425\n00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.710\nSo again, additional diagnosis is trying\nto answer the question about escalation.\n\n426\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.490\nThere's two types of escalation,\nhierarchic and functional, right.\n\n427\n00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.170\nIt could be that neither\none of those are required.\n\n428\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.010\nYou don't need to escalate it.\n\n429\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.738\nBecause you at the service desk following\nthe incident management model, or\n\n430\n00:22:24.738 --> 00:22:27.200\nthe incident model,\nyou know what to do with it.\n\n431\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.910\nYou've seen it before,\nyou know how to fix it.\n\n432\n00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.260\nYou don't have to contact anybody.\n\n433\n00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.680\nSo escalation is also an option\nthat does not have to be selected.\n\n434\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.460\nOnce you identify obviously the\nresolution, you implement that resolution,\n\n435\n00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.580\nyou recover, and\nthen you wait for closure.\n\n436\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.730\nItel has a pretty strong prescription.\n\n437\n00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.504\nWouldn't say prescription,\nbut a previous position that\n\n438\n00:22:49.504 --> 00:22:53.740\nthe closure happens when the user\nsays it's been resolved right?\n\n439\n00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.850\nYou wait for the user feedback to say,\nyes, I agree, it's all fixed,\n\n440\n00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:58.980\nthank you very much.\n\n441\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:04.470\nYou wait for that final buy-in from\nthe user that raised the incident.\n\n442\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:09.160\n>> Terry real quick, we're talking\nabout how, if should I escalate, right?\n\n443\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.413\nMaybe I'm working on the service desk and\nI know what the answer is,\n\n444\n00:23:12.413 --> 00:23:13.567\nI know what it has to be.\n\n445\n00:23:13.567 --> 00:23:17.670\nBut I don't have the authority\nto implement that solution.\n\n446\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.380\nI'm going to have to escalate that\neven though I could do it myself\n\n447\n00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.832\ngiven the correct resources.\n\n448\n00:23:22.832 --> 00:23:23.425\n>> Absolutely,\n\n449\n00:23:23.425 --> 00:23:26.630\nobviously in that particular scenario you\njust mentioned there's some governance in\n\n450\n00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.410\nplace that tells the service desk\nhow they're supposed to behave.\n\n451\n00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.230\nAnd in that case, of course, you would\nhave to escalate because there's that\n\n452\n00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.418\ngovernance in place that says, do this.\n\n453\n00:23:34.418 --> 00:23:35.610\n>> All right.\n\n454\n00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:36.600\n>> All right, very good.\n\n455\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.810\nAll right, incident management\n\n456\n00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.820\nobviously could be interacting with\nlots of different other processes.\n\n457\n00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.901\nThis is kind of a survey of those\nprocesses it could interact with.\n\n458\n00:23:48.901 --> 00:23:53.493\nIt's neither exhaustive or fully\nexplanatory just how it could interact\n\n459\n00:23:53.493 --> 00:23:58.083\nwith these These little spider web\ngraphics are a good reminder that these\n\n460\n00:23:58.083 --> 00:24:03.359\nprocesses don't operate in a vacuum,\nthey interact with other processes, okay.\n\n461\n00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:09.294\nAll right, problem management.\n\n462\n00:24:09.294 --> 00:24:13.851\nThe purpose of problem management\nis to minimize the adverse\n\n463\n00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:18.675\nimpact of incidents and\nproblems by getting to the root cause and\n\n464\n00:24:18.675 --> 00:24:22.650\ninitiating access to get rid of them,\nright?\n\n465\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.460\nSo problem management\nis very deliberative,\n\n466\n00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.455\nwhereas incident management is, get this\nthing back up as quickly as possible.\n\n467\n00:24:28.455 --> 00:24:32.522\nProblem management really wants to\ndig down into the details of why this\n\n468\n00:24:32.522 --> 00:24:33.210\nhappened.\n\n469\n00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:37.320\nAsk many, many questions as to why\nit happened and resolve that source.\n\n470\n00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.900\n>> Kind of like\nan investigator at that point.\n\n471\n00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.080\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n472\n00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.390\nExactly like an investigator.\n\n473\n00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:43.930\nMuch more deliberative.\n\n474\n00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:49.160\nNow there is a reactive and\nproactive approach to problem management.\n\n475\n00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.300\nCertainly reactive,\nthere's incidents you research and\n\n476\n00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.280\nyou try to get deep down and find those.\n\n477\n00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.440\nWe should also be proactive.\n\n478\n00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.230\nDo you recall the scenario I mentioned in\nanother episode where I had a database\n\n479\n00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.530\nissue that caused many,\nmany hours of outage.\n\n480\n00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.030\nAnd I learned something that day.\n\n481\n00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.260\nRight, great, I learned something\nthat day and I took care of mine.\n\n482\n00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.880\nProactive problem management would be hm,\n\n483\n00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.260\ncould that happen to some other\nservice at my organization?\n\n484\n00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.310\nLet's go help them prevent\nthis problem from happening.\n\n485\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:20.190\nRight, so do some pre-investigative\nwork to see if there's risk out there in\n\n486\n00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.410\nthe environment somewhere, and\nthen plug the hole in that risk\n\n487\n00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.690\nto make sure that outage doesn't\nhappen in other services.\n\n488\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.910\n>> The preemptive strike.\n\n489\n00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.830\n>> The preemptive strike, exactly right.\n\n490\n00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.690\nSo problem management\nis not just reactive,\n\n491\n00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.230\nit should have a proactive component,\nas well.\n\n492\n00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.460\nAnd that's good test fodder by the way\nthat problem management is both reactive\n\n493\n00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.880\nand proactive, all right?\n\n494\n00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.838\nHere's this word, problem model,\npre-defined steps for\n\n495\n00:25:45.838 --> 00:25:48.220\nhandling particular kind of problems,\nright?\n\n496\n00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:54.739\nIncidents may reoccur unless you get to\nthat underlying issue, problem, right?\n\n497\n00:25:54.739 --> 00:25:57.179\nThe problem is that underlying\ndisease if you will,\n\n498\n00:25:57.179 --> 00:25:59.990\nthe incidents are the symptoms\nof that disease.\n\n499\n00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.360\nProblem is getting rid of it, right?\n\n500\n00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.180\nBeing able to identify those known issues,\n\n501\n00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:11.960\notherwise known as a known error record\nis another goal of problem management,\n\n502\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.210\nidentify what you know and\nput it in a database.\n\n503\n00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.230\nA KEDB they describe here.\n\n504\n00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.970\nA known error database is a great tool.\n\n505\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:25.100\nAnd if you use a known error database,\neffectively the service desk can\n\n506\n00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.130\nread the known air database every\nmorning when they come in and\n\n507\n00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.180\nsee the new ones at the top.\n\n508\n00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.782\nAnd then if an incident comes in,\nthey don't have to think about,\n\n509\n00:26:32.782 --> 00:26:34.740\ndo I need to escalate,\ndo I need to do this?\n\n510\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.040\nNo I'll go to the known error database and\nperhaps there's a workaround out there.\n\n511\n00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.140\nThat I can just go ahead and follow,\nI don't have to think about it so much,\n\n512\n00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.910\nI just got to implement the known error,\nwork around as necessary.\n\n513\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.280\n>> Actually, we're just in a place where\nwe implemented, they basically grabbed\n\n514\n00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:56.560\na Wiki template to create a Wiki and\nfor the internet of common problems.\n\n515\n00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.890\nYou can easily go there.\n\n516\n00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.470\nSearch the problem,\nfinalize the answers in that\n\n517\n00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.970\nWiki style format that everybody knows and\nloves, and it was highly successful.\n\n518\n00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.020\nVery good.\n\n519\n00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.090\n>> I've seen it implemented\nmore as a database.\n\n520\n00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:13.211\nA relational database with a nice\ngood search engine on top of it.\n\n521\n00:27:13.211 --> 00:27:15.830\n>> Right.\n>> With index entries such\n\n522\n00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.210\nas a Wiki might do.\n\n523\n00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.356\nBut rather than have the links and\nstuff like a Wiki does, it was a search\n\n524\n00:27:20.356 --> 00:27:24.340\nengine that then gave you a bunch of\nresults and then you go pick on those.\n\n525\n00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.370\nVarious ways to skin this cat.\n\n526\n00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.270\nVery good approach there.\nBut\n\n527\n00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:32.680\nthe concept is, get these known errors\nidentified, get them documented, and\n\n528\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.510\nmake it accessible to the service\ndesk to speed up instant resolution.\n\n529\n00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.010\nVery good.\n\n530\n00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.932\nAll right, problem management,\nas you can see here also has a work flow.\n\n531\n00:27:43.932 --> 00:27:48.550\nNot gonna dive too deep into this\nparticular details of this, but\n\n532\n00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:52.010\nI do wanna show at a high\nlevel that problem management\n\n533\n00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:56.010\ncould certainly interact with\nother processes and tool sets.\n\n534\n00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:00.940\nAs an example, the problem once identified\ncould be loaded into the CMS or\n\n535\n00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:01.960\nidentified in the CMS.\n\n536\n00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.000\nSo if you've got a problem with server\nXYZ, then the problem records will\n\n537\n00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.198\nbe associated with server XYZ in the CMS,\nand overtime you could do trend analysis.\n\n538\n00:28:12.198 --> 00:28:15.350\nUnless servers had a lot of problems\nover the course of this year.\n\n539\n00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.380\nMaybe it's time to put that one up the\npast year, or something like that, right.\n\n540\n00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:25.590\nObviously, interacting with\nincident management is a pretty\n\n541\n00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:30.830\ncommon interaction because problems are\ntrying to resolve incidents that recur,\n\n542\n00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:35.070\nyou could have an approach here to\ninteract with incident management through\n\n543\n00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:40.190\nthat known error database\nas we just discussed.\n\n544\n00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.895\nMoving down the line once you\ndetermine the root cause, and\n\n545\n00:28:42.895 --> 00:28:46.075\nmaybe you can fix that cause by\nimplementing some sort of change,\n\n546\n00:28:46.075 --> 00:28:48.645\nthen problem management can raise\nthat request for change and\n\n547\n00:28:48.645 --> 00:28:52.355\nmake sure change management kicks\noff what it needs to do, right?\n\n548\n00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:55.710\nSo problem management can lead\nout to many other processes and\n\n549\n00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.870\nmany other aspects, wherever it may lead.\n\n550\n00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.640\nIn fact, problem management, if you\nhave a good problem management regime,\n\n551\n00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.590\nyou can discern problems upstream, right?\n\n552\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.540\nMaybe you have bad design\nthat keeps recurring so\n\n553\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.710\nyou need to go back to service design and\ntry to shore up those processes.\n\n554\n00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.680\nMaybe even strategy is kind of flawed.\n\n555\n00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.520\nYou don't have good financial reporting.\n\n556\n00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.380\nI mean all kinds of things\nproblem management could dig up.\n\n557\n00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.490\nSo wherever the trail leads,\nproblem management can give you an answer.\n\n558\n00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.150\nThe root cause for this was x.\n\n559\n00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:31.050\nGo to where x is, mark that spot and\nstart trying to improve it, right?\n\n560\n00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.335\nFinally, about major problems.\n\n561\n00:29:33.335 --> 00:29:36.760\nYou could have major problems usually\nassociated with major incidents.\n\n562\n00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.770\nIn fact, that's exactly how\nI had put it in the past,\n\n563\n00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:43.970\nwas if there was a major incident,\nwe had a problem record.\n\n564\n00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.640\nBecause we want to know, we're gonna\nget it back as soon as possible.\n\n565\n00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.390\nBut since it was a major incident,\nwe're gonna have a deep dive in\n\n566\n00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:54.190\nthat major incident, and do some root\ncause analysis and root cause elimination.\n\n567\n00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.520\nSo it doesn't come back.\n\n568\n00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.760\nAnd hopefully do some proactive\nroot cause analysis as well so\n\n569\n00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.926\nwe can forestall those problems\nin other ways for other services.\n\n570\n00:30:04.926 --> 00:30:08.700\nAll right, again, a good reminder that\nproblem management like the other\n\n571\n00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:15.050\nprocesses are integrated across\nmultiple processes in ITIL.\n\n572\n00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.610\nThis is just a reminder that\nit can go just about anywhere.\n\n573\n00:30:20.002 --> 00:30:21.990\n>> All right,\n\n574\n00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:26.710\nthat's a good place to stop here with the\nprocess definitions and understandings.\n\n575\n00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.720\nWe've gone through Incident problem.\n\n576\n00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.890\nWe've got Event Request and\nAccess Management to still up.\n\n577\n00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.490\nWe'll pick those up in another episode.\n\n578\n00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.350\n>> Great stuff, Terry.\n\n579\n00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.910\nWell thanks so much for explaining and\nwalking us through this, guiding us,\n\n580\n00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.370\ncuz it's a lot of information.\n\n581\n00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.960\nITIL's got a lot of stuff\nthat we gotta know.\n\n582\n00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.770\nObviously tons of key concepts,\n\n583\n00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:46.210\ndefinitions that we're just having\nto bury into the old noodle.\n\n584\n00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.000\nAnd you walking us through it and\n\n585\n00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.110\nhelping us make some sense out\nof it all is very, very helpful.\n\n586\n00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.460\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n587\n00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.890\nWe thank you guys for watching today,\nbut we're out of time for\n\n588\n00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.200\nthis episode but don't fret.\n\n589\n00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.860\nThere is more when it comes to\nservice operations so be prepared for\n\n590\n00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.730\npart II on that.\n\n591\n00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:04.880\nHopefully we'll see you there.\n\n592\n00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.880\nThat being said we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n593\n00:31:06.880 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.750\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.170\nin today's episode we are moving forward\nwith more in our ITIL Foundation series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.830\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday for one of our famous part twos,\n\n6\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.730\nis the man, the myth, the legend,\nthat is Terry Decker.\n\n7\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.280\nTerry, welcome back sir, how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.740\n>> Glad to be here Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.190\nYep, as he said,\nwe covered a lot of ground so far.\n\n10\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.570\nWe've gotten a good portion\nthrough service operations,\n\n11\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.480\nwant to pick up the rest\nof that in this episode.\n\n12\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.370\nWe got two or three more process to go and\n\n13\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.300\nfour functions to discuss in this episode,\nso a lot to learn, let's dig in.\n\n14\n00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.510\nWe have a few processes yet to go.\n\n15\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.995\nWe have Event, Request Fulfillment,\nand Access Management left to go.\n\n16\n00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:56.597\nWe've talked about Event\na little bit already, so\n\n17\n00:00:56.597 --> 00:01:00.925\nthis will be a shortchange one, and\nthen we got four functions after that.\n\n18\n00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:05.635\nSo, Event Management, to detect events,\nmake sense of them, and\n\n19\n00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:06.996\ndetermine the appropriate control action.\n\n20\n00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:10.597\nRemind ourselves what an event is though.\n\n21\n00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:17.437\nAn event is a change in state of\na CI that you care about, right?\n\n22\n00:01:17.437 --> 00:01:18.677\nThat's significant.\n\n23\n00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:20.548\nA significant change of state.\n\n24\n00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:23.308\nSo, the detection is actually automated.\n\n25\n00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:25.048\nSo, the detection is there.\n\n26\n00:01:25.048 --> 00:01:27.148\nNow we need to make sense of it,\nand do something about it.\n\n27\n00:01:27.148 --> 00:01:31.448\nThe example I mentioned earlier was,\nthe disk is 75% full, right?\n\n28\n00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:36.029\nThat can be detected, a notification can\ngo out, someone can respond to that,\n\n29\n00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.769\nand keep it from getting full\nbefore the remedy's there, right?\n\n30\n00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:44.699\nSo detecting those changes of state\nis what Event Management is about.\n\n31\n00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:50.090\nMaking sense of those changes of state and\ndoing the appropriate action, right?\n\n32\n00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.030\n>> So basically, if the alert comes in,\nokay, your disc is 75% full.\n\n33\n00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.220\nAnd you go, well that's interesting\nbecause yesterday it was only 10% full.\n\n34\n00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.050\nYou're thinking,\nnow I'm making sense of this.\n\n35\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.380\nThere's something happening\nthat's filling up my disk.\n\n36\n00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.230\nIf it's, wow, we've had that disk a long\ntime and now we just hit that 75% mark.\n\n37\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.901\nI might start looking into upgrading\nit to a larger disk because now you've\n\n38\n00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:15.910\nreached maybe end of life or capacity.\n\n39\n00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.940\n>> Right.\n\n40\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.190\nAnd keep in mind events can be for\ncomponent things, it can be for\n\n41\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.180\nphysical things like the data\ncenter is getting hot.\n\n42\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.230\nSo you got a temperature gauge\nthat triggers off an event so\n\n43\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.120\nthat you can get to the data\ncenter quickly enough, right?\n\n44\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.970\nIt can be for lots of things.\n\n45\n00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.780\nAnd sometimes it's just for\nmundane things.\n\n46\n00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.740\nThe batch file completed successfully.\n\n47\n00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.725\nThe backup was successful, right?\n\n48\n00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:40.420\nYou don't have to necessarily respond, but\nyou want to know that, that happened so\n\n49\n00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.540\nyou log the event, it's detected and\nyou can do something or\n\n50\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.810\ndo nothing because it simply showed\nsuccess of something, right.\n\n51\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.790\nSo that's a good segue\nto the types of events\n\n52\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.960\nthat are in the scope of Event Management.\n\n53\n00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.140\nAnd definitely worthy of memorization here\n\n54\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.240\nis that Event Management\nhas three types of events.\n\n55\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.460\nInformational events would just\nindicate regular operation.\n\n56\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.330\nLike I just mentioned,\nthe batch file completed successfully.\n\n57\n00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.560\nThe backup was successful.\n\n58\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.260\nTerry Decker logged in today, right?\n\n59\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.010\nUsually, something like log-ins\nare actually logged, automatically, right?\n\n60\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.480\nIt's not something you have to respond to.\n\n61\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.780\nIt's just information only, right?\n\n62\n00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.480\nNow if that Terry Decker logged in today,\nhappened to coincide with the same morning\n\n63\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.030\nthat there was data theft, then having\na log of who logged in gives you your\n\n64\n00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.025\nability to do some forensic analysis of,\nwhere did did Terry go when he logged in?\n\n65\n00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:36.585\nDid he log into the HR database and\nsteal all the salary information, right?\n\n66\n00:03:36.585 --> 00:03:38.055\nSo information-\n>> We're\n\n67\n00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:39.433\nnot gonna let that happen again are we?\n\n68\n00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:39.941\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n69\n00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:40.646\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n70\n00:03:40.646 --> 00:03:43.146\n>> So informational events can become\n\n71\n00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:46.668\nmore significant later.\nThey may not be significant now but\n\n72\n00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:49.550\nmore important later on.\n\n73\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.790\nA Warning event is a warning\nlike the disk is 75% full,\n\n74\n00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.770\nlet's go and get that disk\nfreed up a little bit, right,\n\n75\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.480\nbefore it actually causes problems,\nthat it's a 100% full.\n\n76\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.110\nSo a warning event is just that.\n\n77\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.675\nIt's giving you advance warning so\n\n78\n00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:09.450\nthat you can get in front of the problem\nbefore it actually impacts users, right?\n\n79\n00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.870\nAnd then an Exception event, well it's\ntoo late, the disk is 100% full, right?\n\n80\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.470\nIt already got there, the thing fell over,\nor the data center's on\n\n81\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.370\nfire instead of it's just getting warm,\nright, those kind of things.\n\n82\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.033\nThose would be-\n>> It's cold in there,\n\n83\n00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:24.045\nwe had to do something.\n\n84\n00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:25.338\n[LAUGH]\n>> Except sniffing,\n\n85\n00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:27.505\nhe built a little fire in the data center.\n\n86\n00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:28.200\n>> That's right.\n\n87\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.260\n>> A weenie roast in\nthe data center this week.\n\n88\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.112\n>> There was no policy that\nsaid we couldn't do that.\n\n89\n00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:33.955\n[LAUGH]\n>> Very good.\n\n90\n00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:36.580\nSo that's Event Management.\n\n91\n00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.590\nRequest Fulfillment,\nalso a fairly easy throw when you consider\n\n92\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.280\nthat request fulfillment is the process\n\n93\n00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.910\nthrough which you satisfy or\nhandle common service requests.\n\n94\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.040\nI mentioned some examples earlier\nlike I need a new headset.\n\n95\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.700\nI need a mouse, right.\n\n96\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.460\nI need more disk space, maybe that's\na common request of the server team,\n\n97\n00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.300\nI need more disk space.\n\n98\n00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.300\nI need a virtual machine, that may be\na common request that you standardize so\n\n99\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.700\nthat you can quickly satisfy\nthose kinds of requests.\n\n100\n00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.720\nI need a restore, I need a backup,\nthose kind of things.\n\n101\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.910\nYou might decide to standardize that type\nof activity and put it behind the workflow\n\n102\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.320\nso that people can easily request\nthose services ongoing basis, right?\n\n103\n00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.550\nThat's what Request Fulfillment is about.\n\n104\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.330\nAnd then finally, last but\nnot the least, Access Management.\n\n105\n00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.988\nAlso fairly intuitive for most folks.\n\n106\n00:05:34.988 --> 00:05:39.040\nMost folks at IT are already used to\nlogging in, and getting access to things.\n\n107\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.400\nThey're also used to logging in, and\nnot getting access to others, right?\n\n108\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.280\nThere's certain things you have access to,\nthere's certain things they don't, right?\n\n109\n00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.400\nAccess Management is the process,\n\n110\n00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.320\nthat ensures that the right people\nget access to things, right?\n\n111\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.040\nSo, they're managing\nthe group memberships,\n\n112\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.250\nthey're managing the resources, right?\n\n113\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.720\nThey are not,\nI say what access is not doing.\n\n114\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.960\nAccess Management is not\ndetermining who gets it,\n\n115\n00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.110\nthey're just following a process, right?\n\n116\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.110\nSo, again I'm the employee that supposed\nto have access to the HR database\n\n117\n00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.320\nto review salaries,\nI'm the Compensation Analyst.\n\n118\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.880\nThe HR Director perhaps,\nis initiating that request.\n\n119\n00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.430\nIt goes through due diligence\nto satisfy security policy.\n\n120\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.550\nAnd eventually,\n\n121\n00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.360\nI'm granted that access because it\nfollowed that particular workflow.\n\n122\n00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.110\nSo Access Management, again,\nfairly intuitive for most people.\n\n123\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.390\nIt's the operational extension\nof the security policy or\n\n124\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.265\nthe security management\nprocess that's upstream, okay.\n\n125\n00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.720\nThat's the five processes, right?\n\n126\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.790\nIncident, Problem, Event, Request\nFulfillment, and Access Management.\n\n127\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.590\nAnd then next up are four functions.\n\n128\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.995\nThe four functions within,\nas described by ITIL.\n\n129\n00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:58.120\nAgain, ITILs great at distilling\nthings into smaller parts.\n\n130\n00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.160\nA Function you'll recall,\nthe definition of a function is\n\n131\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.340\na group of people with special skills and\ntools, right?\n\n132\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.504\nThey're a finite set of people,\nso to speak, right?\n\n133\n00:07:08.504 --> 00:07:12.018\nAnd they have special talents,\nthey even have special expertise, and\n\n134\n00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:16.133\nthey also have special tools allowing them\nto get what they are doing done, right?\n\n135\n00:07:16.133 --> 00:07:19.280\nSo, they divide it up into four.\n\n136\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.340\nOne of these functions happens\nto have some sub-functions.\n\n137\n00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.360\nSo if you really want to look at it,\n\n138\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.110\nthere's six things to memorize here,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.870\nThese four functions,\nplus two sub-functions.\n\n140\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.730\nWe're gonna talk about each of these.\n\n141\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.020\nBut definitely worth committing to memory,\njust as you see them on this page.\n\n142\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.940\nWhat are the four functions,\nwhat are the two sub-functions?\n\n143\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.480\nAnd we'll talk about them each in turn.\n\n144\n00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.650\nService Desk, Technical Management,\n\n145\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.640\nApplication Management,\nIT Operations Management and\n\n146\n00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.530\nits two sub-functions, IT Operations\nControl and Facilities Management.\n\n147\n00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.340\nWe first start with Service Desk.\n\n148\n00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:58.065\nMost folks also find this fairly\nintuitive, because most IT organizations\n\n149\n00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:01.270\nhave a Service Desk,\nsometimes called a Help Desk.\n\n150\n00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.456\nIt's not unusual for that to happen\nin most IT departments now, so\n\n151\n00:08:05.456 --> 00:08:07.941\nthis is a fairly intuitive thing, so.\n\n152\n00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:13.132\nSome things to point out, the way ITEL\nenvisions the service desk is they really\n\n153\n00:08:13.132 --> 00:08:18.014\ndo visualize the service desk as a single\npoint of contact between users and\n\n154\n00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:21.424\nthe service provider with\na high predisposition for\n\n155\n00:08:21.424 --> 00:08:23.990\nsingle point of contact.\n\n156\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.552\nSo if an incident comes in, or if\na request comes in, the service desk will\n\n157\n00:08:28.552 --> 00:08:33.648\nhandle it and maybe they have to escalate,\nmaybe it goes to other people, right.\n\n158\n00:08:33.648 --> 00:08:39.445\nBut the closure of this incident will\nalways come back to the service desk for\n\n159\n00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:43.310\nfinal sign off,\nif you will, from the user.\n\n160\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.450\nSo, again, high predisposition for\na single point of contact.\n\n161\n00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.240\nA good service desk can make\na mediocre service look really good.\n\n162\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.420\nAnd of course, the corollary is true,\nor the adverse is true.\n\n163\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.930\nA bad service desk can make a fairly\ngood service look bad, if it's not.\n\n164\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.860\nAnd you probably have some experiences\nin your own life of dealing with service\n\n165\n00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.415\ndesks where a good service desk whether\nit be at a hotel, at a restaurant,\n\n166\n00:09:10.415 --> 00:09:15.010\nan IT service provider, your cable TV\nprovider, where you've had good service.\n\n167\n00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.790\nEven though the service was bad,\nyou consider the service desk helpful.\n\n168\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.690\nAnd then vice versa,\nwhere the service wasn't so\n\n169\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.120\nbad but\nthe service desk people were awful, right.\n\n170\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.613\nYou got any examples like that\nin your own experience Daniel?\n\n171\n00:09:27.613 --> 00:09:30.595\n>> I don't wanna run\npeople through the mud.\n\n172\n00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:31.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n173\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.145\nYou still want your cable TV.\n\n174\n00:09:33.145 --> 00:09:35.570\n>> Yeah that's right.\n\n175\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.321\nThey're watching us right now.\n\n176\n00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:38.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> Good point.\n\n177\n00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.895\n>> I love all of them equally.\n\n178\n00:09:40.895 --> 00:09:44.187\n[LAUGH]\n>> [COUGH] So you also could come up with\n\n179\n00:09:44.187 --> 00:09:49.920\nsome clear objectives and\nstructures for your service desk.\n\n180\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.330\nBecause the service desk is\nthe front end between users and\n\n181\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:59.100\nthe service provider, between\nthe users and the service provider.\n\n182\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.180\nBecause of that they're often on the front\nend of incident management, right,\n\n183\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.280\nbecause users can call the service desk,\nright.\n\n184\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.780\nThey're often on the front end\nof request fulfillment too.\n\n185\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.370\nSo the service desk is a function that\nhappens to be on the front end of a couple\n\n186\n00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.000\nof processes, right.\n\n187\n00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.920\nBut not all requests go\nthrough the service desk,\n\n188\n00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.055\nnot all incidents start\nat the service desk.\n\n189\n00:10:18.055 --> 00:10:21.230\nIncidents could happen in the back,\nrequests could happen in the back.\n\n190\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.520\nBut there is some common points there\nwhere a lot of requests and a lot of\n\n191\n00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.980\nincidents, especially from users, will be\ncoming through the service desk, right.\n\n192\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.785\n>> That's until they find out your number.\n\n193\n00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:34.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right just call you back later.\n\n194\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.785\n>> Yeah they just call me directly.\n\n195\n00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:38.430\n>> And see that's where it's pretty good,\nthe don't call Daniel policy so\n\n196\n00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.220\nto speak, right.\n\n197\n00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.810\nSo while you could have a solid\ninstant management process,\n\n198\n00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.240\nif people know that they're just\ngonna be escalating to Daniel and\n\n199\n00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.510\nthey just leave the service desk out,\nright, that can be debilitating.\n\n200\n00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.400\nTo Daniel, for one,\n\n201\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.660\nbecause he's busy on the phone\njust chasing all kinds of things.\n\n202\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.270\nWhat should Daniel really be working on\nbesides all of these incidents, right?\n\n203\n00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.870\nAnd your service desk is not\nthe single point of contact anymore,\n\n204\n00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.360\nthey're kind of going around it.\n\n205\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.030\nSo having policies that back up these\nprocesses is part of governance and\n\n206\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.308\na good idea to have in place.\n\n207\n00:11:06.308 --> 00:11:08.380\n>> Yeah, I use to have to tell people\nall the time cuz they would do\n\n208\n00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:08.960\nthat very thing.\n\n209\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.640\nThey'd call me direct and I would say,\nyeah I could probably help you but\n\n210\n00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.390\nwe have a chain of command,\nyou need to go through the service desk.\n\n211\n00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.370\nLet them try to help you.\n\n212\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.450\nIf they can't, if not,\nthey'll escalate it to me.\n\n213\n00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.720\nBut that's the proper way to do things.\n\n214\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.980\nThat way we have the proper\nchain of events.\n\n215\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.420\nWe know exactly how everything happens.\n\n216\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.780\nEverybody's doing their job\nthe way they've been hired to do.\n\n217\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.860\nAnd it was a real problem.\n\n218\n00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.680\nWe had to work a lot with people not\nto just try to bypass the help desk and\n\n219\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.390\ndo it the correct way.\n\n220\n00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.860\n>> And besides,\nas we've already learned, Daniel,\n\n221\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.930\nI've got a few YouTube videos\nyou wanted me to watch.\n\n222\n00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.600\n>> They're not gonna watch themselves.\n\n223\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.203\n>> Exactly.\nSo yeah.\n\n224\n00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.639\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right folks, come on, let's be honest.\n\n225\n00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:46.600\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Very good.\n\n226\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.060\nAll right, so let's talk about\nsome structures of service desk.\n\n227\n00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.430\nNow these describe physical structures\nof service desks, almost like\n\n228\n00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:00.450\ngeographic location of service desks as we\ngo through several of these structures.\n\n229\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.090\nThey're not mutually exclusive.\n\n230\n00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.260\nThey do describe structures,\n\n231\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.950\nbut any given organization could have\na mixture of these structures in play.\n\n232\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.950\nFirst of all, the local service desk.\n\n233\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.390\nAs the name implies,\nthe service desk is co located\n\n234\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.030\nwith the users at the geographic\nlocation where the users are.\n\n235\n00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.670\nSo if you're a small organization, and\nhave the users all in one building,\n\n236\n00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.790\nthen a local service desk is\nmaybe appropriate, right.\n\n237\n00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:32.230\nBut if you have multiple branches and you\nneed to serve your users across multiple\n\n238\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.100\nbranches then perhaps a centralized\nservice desk is more appropriate.\n\n239\n00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.780\nYou certainly get more scale\nif it's centralized, right.\n\n240\n00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.310\nAnd you don't have one local service desk\nthat's kinda twiddling their thumbs, and\n\n241\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.550\nanother second local service\nthat's busy as can be, right.\n\n242\n00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:52.320\nSo a centralized service desk allows\nyou to scale a bit more efficiently and\n\n243\n00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.000\ncost effectively than local service desks,\nall right.\n\n244\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.650\nLocal centralized and then it's this\nidea of a virtual service desk.\n\n245\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.790\nI've encountered these.\n\n246\n00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.650\nI believe AppleCare through Mac products\nis a virtual service desk where you might\n\n247\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.500\nstart a chat and the person online,\nthey actually might be in Singapore today.\n\n248\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.900\nTomorrow you get on,\nyou might get someone from Mexico.\n\n249\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.771\nThese technicians that are there to serve\nyou, it's a community of practitioners,\n\n250\n00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:23.727\nand they can just be anywhere as\nlong as they have connectivity and\n\n251\n00:13:23.727 --> 00:13:25.361\nare online ready to serve, right.\n\n252\n00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:29.424\nSo a virtual service desk\ngives you that ability.\n\n253\n00:13:29.424 --> 00:13:32.764\nYour not worried about geography at all,\nthey're just kind of all over the place,\n\n254\n00:13:32.764 --> 00:13:34.460\nthere's no physical location.\n\n255\n00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.450\nThey're just virtually there\nwhen you need them, right.\n\n256\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:44.810\nSome good advantages to this would be\nlocal time zone coverage, language,\n\n257\n00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:50.678\nperhaps language and cultural synergies,\netc, could be playing out there, right.\n\n258\n00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:54.530\nAnother structure Is\ncalled Follow the Sun.\n\n259\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.310\nAnd Follow the Sun, I mean,\n\n260\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.910\none of the values of Follow the Sun\nis you can provide 24 7 but\n\n261\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:06.510\nhonestly you can provide 24 7 coverage for\nmany of these structures.\n\n262\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.990\nJust have multiple shifts come in, right.\n\n263\n00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.620\nSo while one of the values\nof Follow Sun is 24 7,\n\n264\n00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.010\nthat same value can be rendered\nthrough other structures.\n\n265\n00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.470\nSo I think really what happened\nwith Follow the Sun is that,\n\n266\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.400\nif you're a goal oriented organization\nsuch as I used to work for, you could have\n\n267\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.470\na service desk that's awake during\nthe day time hours in the far east,\n\n268\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.612\nsay in Singapore and then another\none that's maybe in central Europe,\n\n269\n00:14:30.612 --> 00:14:35.930\nsay Poland, and then another one yet\nin Costa Rica, right.\n\n270\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.760\nSo you can have your service desk\ngeographically spread across the world so\n\n271\n00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.930\nthat as the sun is coming\nup in the Far East,\n\n272\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.330\nthere is a service desk team ready\nto serve that part of the country.\n\n273\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:51.007\nAnd then it overlaps as the sun keeps\ngoing, it overlaps into Central Europe,\n\n274\n00:14:51.007 --> 00:14:53.090\nright, and crossing that time zone, and\n\n275\n00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:58.030\nthen of course is across the Atlantic and\nextends on westward you got\n\n276\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.280\na service desk on that side of the world\nto handle service calls there, right.\n\n277\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.950\nThe primary advantage of Follow\nthe Sun is probably not the 24 7,\n\n278\n00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.110\nit's probably the cultural and\n\n279\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:13.120\nlinguistic synergies you can get as you're\ngoing across and also just labor cost.\n\n280\n00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.840\nYou can find cheaper labor markets in\nthose areas as you follow the sun, and\n\n281\n00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.200\nthat can drive some success and\nsome cost savings as you attempt to\n\n282\n00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.360\nmanage your global reach if you happen\nto be a global organization, right.\n\n283\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.650\nSo again, we got local,\nwe got centralized, we got virtual,\n\n284\n00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.840\nand we've got Follow the Sun.\n\n285\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.530\nIt's not really a structure, but\n\n286\n00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.600\nyou can have a service desk\nthat's just specialized,\n\n287\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.990\na specialized service desk that handles\njust very specific types of things.\n\n288\n00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.730\nOne example I've seen in the industry is\nthat an executive service desk, right.\n\n289\n00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.130\nSo the senior vice presidents,\n\n290\n00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.510\nthey don't call the main service\ndesk number, they call another one.\n\n291\n00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.087\nAnd there's people nearby at that\ngeographic location, and they actually do\n\n292\n00:15:56.087 --> 00:15:59.732\nhands on service right at the desktop for\ninstance, right, that sorta thing.\n\n293\n00:15:59.732 --> 00:16:04.544\nI've seen other specialized service\ndesks that stand up for awhile for\n\n294\n00:16:04.544 --> 00:16:06.560\na new launch of a new service.\n\n295\n00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.034\nSo the new calls go into this Specialized\nservice desk that's handling all\n\n296\n00:16:11.034 --> 00:16:15.140\nthe calls because you've entered\nsomething new or big, right?\n\n297\n00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.050\nSo for a temporary time it's in play,\nright?\n\n298\n00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.890\nSo again,\na specialized desk could be set up for\n\n299\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.410\nfull time,\nsimilar to the executive service desk.\n\n300\n00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.700\nOr it could be something just comes in and\nfills a gap temporarily while you're\n\n301\n00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.630\nworking through elevated resources or\nelevated escalations.\n\n302\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.782\nRight, that sort of thing.\n\n303\n00:16:34.782 --> 00:16:39.630\nAll right, so\n\n304\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:44.490\nthe service desk is often under\nthe guise of measurement and metrics.\n\n305\n00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.270\nHow fast they respond?\n\n306\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.010\nHow many calls do they take?\n\n307\n00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.910\nHow quickly they restore, right?\n\n308\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.160\nJust as you know, how long was a call\nin the queue before it was answered?\n\n309\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.220\nThose kinds of things.\n\n310\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.800\nSo a lot of metrics drive service\ndesk behavior because it is such\n\n311\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.190\na focal point between the users and\nthe service provider.\n\n312\n00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:10.330\nIt has such a customer facing impact\nthat it's often a good target for your\n\n313\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.510\nservice level agreements, and making sure\nyou're measuring the right things, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.520\nOkay, so while the service desk\nwas definitely customer facing and\n\n315\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:23.350\nhas a lot of interface, these next\nthree functions while they will have\n\n316\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.700\ninterface with customers and\nperhaps interface with user now and then.\n\n317\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.130\nThey're more on the back end, right?\n\n318\n00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.610\nThey're more in the back end.\n\n319\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:35.590\nSo we're gonna start with a technical\nmanagement and application management and\n\n320\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.950\nthen go to IT operations management.\n\n321\n00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.730\nAnd here they are kind on\none screen which kinda shows\n\n322\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.490\nsome meaningful information here.\n\n323\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.320\nNotice the technical management has these\nareas of specialty underneath them.\n\n324\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.650\nIf you look at those mainframe,\nserver, networks, stores, database etc.\n\n325\n00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:56.570\nThat's the back end or infrastructure\ntype of IT service provision, right?\n\n326\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.100\nIt's in the back.\n\n327\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.900\nOn the other side, on the far right\nwe've got applications management.\n\n328\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.020\nAnd those are two we're gonna\nstart talking about, technical and\n\n329\n00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.760\napplication management.\n\n330\n00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.100\nThey have a lot in common.\n\n331\n00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.290\nWhat they have that's different\nis their areas of specialty.\n\n332\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:13.310\nAgain, technical management is in\nthe back the infrastructure type things.\n\n333\n00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.890\nAnd that's not an exhaustive list,\n\n334\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.880\nyou could add perhaps cloud\ncomputing to that list.\n\n335\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.760\nWeb services to that list, right?\n\n336\n00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.330\nWe've got Internet and\nweb down there, right?\n\n337\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:28.095\nSo there's different levels of expertise\nthat happen in the back, right?\n\n338\n00:18:28.095 --> 00:18:29.525\nThat make things happen.\n\n339\n00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:32.005\nVirtualization might be so\nspecial that you just take that and\n\n340\n00:18:32.005 --> 00:18:33.545\nhave a special box for it, right?\n\n341\n00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:37.695\nApplication management on\nthe other hand is what faces,\n\n342\n00:18:37.695 --> 00:18:40.700\nthat's what customers actually use,\nthey use the application.\n\n343\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.700\nSo if you got financial management,\nor HR apps, and\n\n344\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.940\nyou see this big category, business apps,\n\n345\n00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.680\nthat could be a long list of things\ndepending on what your business is.\n\n346\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.430\nSo again,\nthese lists aren't exhaustive, but\n\n347\n00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.810\nwhat they are is indications\nof the areas of specialty.\n\n348\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.230\nApplication management focuses on those\nthings that are directly consumed,\n\n349\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.000\ncustomer facing applications, whereas\ntechnical management's in the back end,\n\n350\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.510\nthat infrastructure stuff.\n\n351\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:10.440\nSo while they have those differences\nyou can gain a lot of understanding\n\n352\n00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.350\nof these two functions, technical\nmanagement, application management,\n\n353\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.480\nby considering that they\nhave a lot in common, right?\n\n354\n00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.550\nSo they have so much in common I can kinda\nteach them at at the same time, right?\n\n355\n00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.660\nJust give me example.\n\n356\n00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.930\nYou'll see the little\ntrick that I've done,\n\n357\n00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:28.412\nlike a programmer's trick here where you\ncan pick a variable inside the brackets\n\n358\n00:19:28.412 --> 00:19:31.588\nwhere there's technical management or\napplication management, right?\n\n359\n00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:34.694\nInfrastructure applications,\n\n360\n00:19:34.694 --> 00:19:38.530\nso again I can kinda teach them\nboth just by filling base.\n\n361\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.610\nCustodian of technical knowledge and\n\n362\n00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.799\nexpertise related to\nmanaging infrastructure.\n\n363\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.410\nFlip the variables.\n\n364\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.150\nCustodian of application knowledge and\n\n365\n00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.700\nexpertise related to managing application,\nright?\n\n366\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.900\nThey have so much in common.\n\n367\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.520\nWe like to put this is that technical\nmanagement and application management,\n\n368\n00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.470\nthey can go deep and\nwide into their areas of specialty, right?\n\n369\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.040\nSo they're not just locked into\noperational day to day things.\n\n370\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.330\nThey can show up at a strategy meeting and\nhelp you decide whether or\n\n371\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.610\nnot we should virtualize or\nnot virtualize.\n\n372\n00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.790\nOr whether we should go to cloud\ncomputing or internally hosted.\n\n373\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:20.340\nOr an application management member could\nshow up at the same strategy meeting and\n\n374\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.150\nmake a recommendation for\nbuilding and then self developing it.\n\n375\n00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.080\nOr whether we should go out and buy it off\nthe shelf, because they know that area so\n\n376\n00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.840\nwell they can show up at different\nstages of the life cycle and\n\n377\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.080\nnot just manage the day\nto day operations of IT.\n\n378\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.920\nSo technical management and\napplication management they have so\n\n379\n00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.180\nmuch in common that you can\nalmost consider them together.\n\n380\n00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.010\nThey have different areas of focus,\nthey certainly do.\n\n381\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:50.310\nAnd application management is necessarily\ngonna be map to business functions, right?\n\n382\n00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:55.950\nAnd technical management is gonna be tied\nto well supporting applications, right?\n\n383\n00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.940\nSo the relationships are a little\nbit different but the depth and\n\n384\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.710\nthe breadth that they have to hold in\nterms of expertise is very similar.\n\n385\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.050\nSay that again?\n\n386\n00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.490\n>> The breath index.\n\n387\n00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.670\n>> That's right.\n\n388\n00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.227\n>> Little catch phrase for the day, right?\n\n389\n00:21:08.227 --> 00:21:08.863\n>> That's right.\n\n390\n00:21:08.863 --> 00:21:16.000\nAll right, so again, the technical\nmanagement as we look at it here.\n\n391\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.120\nCustodian technical miles,\nwe just saw it before.\n\n392\n00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.880\nAssisting and designing, implementing and\n\n393\n00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.110\nmaintaining a stable of\ninfrastructure to support, right?\n\n394\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.650\nAs I fast forward to applications\nmanagement just right quickly, you'll see\n\n395\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.680\ncustodian a specialist knowledge\nexpertise related to applications.\n\n396\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.690\nYou see how I can teach\nthem at the same time?\n\n397\n00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.460\nThey just have different\nareas of specialty, right?\n\n398\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.410\nAnd they go deep and wide.\n\n399\n00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.630\nAnd they have the breadth.\n\n400\n00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:40.630\n>> And depth.\n\n401\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.170\n>> Very good.\n\n402\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:42.130\nThank you very much.\n\n403\n00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.710\n>> That's right.\n\n404\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.950\n>> All right, so application\ndevelopment is a good highlight here.\n\n405\n00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:55.700\nITIL has an arms link to relationship\nwith the development of applications.\n\n406\n00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:02.790\nWhat I mean by that is ITIL is not\na discipline for developing software.\n\n407\n00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.290\nIt's a framework for\nmanaging services, right?\n\n408\n00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:07.780\nNot developing.\n\n409\n00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:12.944\nSo development is not really something\nITIL even gives any knowledge about or\n\n410\n00:22:12.944 --> 00:22:15.240\nany guidance toward.\n\n411\n00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.950\nThe only thing where development comes\ninto play is that if you are an IT service\n\n412\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:23.150\nprovider and you want to deliver services,\n\n413\n00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.910\nyou might develop your tools for\ndelivering those services, right?\n\n414\n00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.820\nYou might develop your own tools.\n\n415\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.935\nBut in terms of developing solutions,\nI've to recognizes that something is done.\n\n416\n00:22:33.935 --> 00:22:35.235\nIt does happen.\n\n417\n00:22:35.235 --> 00:22:38.085\nI think I saw a bumper sticker the other\nday that said, development happens.\n\n418\n00:22:38.085 --> 00:22:40.095\nBut in that regard,\n\n419\n00:22:40.095 --> 00:22:43.365\ndevelopment is something that ITIL\ndoesn't really dive deep into.\n\n420\n00:22:45.095 --> 00:22:48.320\nApplication management is not\nthe same as development, right?\n\n421\n00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.710\nThe management of applications is\nnot the development of applications.\n\n422\n00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.140\nI told us in address,\nthe development of applications, okay?\n\n423\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.720\nNow last but not least is this fourth\nfunction and it has two sub functions.\n\n424\n00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.910\nIT operations management and\nthese two sub functions, all right?\n\n425\n00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.920\nAnd here those two sub\nfunctions show up to.\n\n426\n00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.870\nNow, as technical management, application\nmanagement goes, those two functions,\n\n427\n00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.750\nthose groups of people with\nspecial skills and tools.\n\n428\n00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:23.300\nThose two functions, they can go deepen\nwide, they have area specialty and\n\n429\n00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.270\nthey can show up a strategy meetings and\ntactical meetings and design meetings,\n\n430\n00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.490\nthey over all the lifecycle stages.\n\n431\n00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.060\nIP operations management\nis day-to-day grind of IT,\n\n432\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.780\nthe day-to-day stuff\nthat just has to happen.\n\n433\n00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.940\nKeeping the lights on, backups and\nrestores, monitoring the data center,\n\n434\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.960\nupdating database files, patching server.\n\n435\n00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.370\nThe day to day grind of IT happens\nin IT operations management,\n\n436\n00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.110\nthat function, right?\n\n437\n00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.790\nNow it's broken into two sub functions,\nIT operations control.\n\n438\n00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.265\nIn one regard you can look at\nIT operations control is kinda\n\n439\n00:24:00.265 --> 00:24:01.475\nlike in the Apollo missions.\n\n440\n00:24:01.475 --> 00:24:03.375\nWe have a problem Houston.\n\n441\n00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:05.201\nOperations control is Houston, right?\n\n442\n00:24:05.201 --> 00:24:07.879\nYou got the monitors, you've got\nyour fingers on the pulse of all\n\n443\n00:24:07.879 --> 00:24:10.279\nthe environmental systems,\nall the technical systems.\n\n444\n00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:12.919\nAnd you know Just the shape\nof IT on any given day.\n\n445\n00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:13.739\nSo it's part of that.\n\n446\n00:24:13.739 --> 00:24:17.060\nOperations control,\nconsole management it's called, right.\n\n447\n00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:21.320\nSo if there's an even that triggers\noff that says the disk is 75% full,\n\n448\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.780\nIT Operations Control is gonna be aware\nof that and do something about it, right.\n\n449\n00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.390\nThat's the kind of thing that\nhappens in IT Operations Control.\n\n450\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.370\nAnd again, the day to day grind, backups,\nrestores, batch completions, etc.\n\n451\n00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.160\nThe other sub-function is\nfacilities management.\n\n452\n00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.540\nAnd facilities management,\n\n453\n00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.350\na key word you can kind of link up\nwith facility management is physical.\n\n454\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.270\nThe physical plant, if you will, of IT.\n\n455\n00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.802\nRight?\n\n456\n00:24:44.802 --> 00:24:46.740\nData centers, power supplies,\n\n457\n00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:51.380\ncooling systems,\nthe security of those, wiring clauses.\n\n458\n00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.250\nThe physical nature of glittering IT\nis what facilities management is about.\n\n459\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.350\nSo you can match up the word\nfacilities with physical and\n\n460\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:04.000\nIT operations control\nwith job scheduling and\n\n461\n00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.057\nmanagement of the day to day grind of\nthings and you'll be in good shape, okay.\n\n462\n00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.948\nSo again to summarize this on functions,\nthere are the four functions listed again,\n\n463\n00:25:12.948 --> 00:25:16.148\nwe've got Service Desk,\nwe've got Technical Management\n\n464\n00:25:16.148 --> 00:25:19.492\nwhich is very analogous to\nApplication Management, right?\n\n465\n00:25:19.492 --> 00:25:23.340\nAnd then you have IT Operations Management\nwith its two sub functions\n\n466\n00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.274\nIT Operations Control and\nFacilities Management.\n\n467\n00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:28.899\nNow I wanna draw attention\nto this shaded area.\n\n468\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:35.750\nIt's certainly possible for any one person\nto play in more than one function, right?\n\n469\n00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.560\nThis is not an organizational chart.\n\n470\n00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.090\nIt's not saying you belong to\nthe Technical Management organization, or\n\n471\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.530\nyou belong to the Application Management\norganization.\n\n472\n00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.920\nIt's not an organizational chart,\nit's a list of functions.\n\n473\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.585\nA list of people you need to have with\nspecial school, skills and tools.\n\n474\n00:25:50.585 --> 00:25:53.908\n[COUGH] Sometime abbreviated schools,\nright?\n\n475\n00:25:53.908 --> 00:25:55.387\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n476\n00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.700\n>> So,\n\n477\n00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.460\nany given person could exist across\nmultiple of these functions.\n\n478\n00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.710\nThey could have day to\nday responsibilities and\n\n479\n00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:05.490\ntherefore play out their activities\nin IT Operations Management.\n\n480\n00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.530\nBut that same person could show\nup at a strategy meeting for\n\n481\n00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.790\nservers of show up at a strategy\nmeeting for directory services, right?\n\n482\n00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.560\nThere are not, this does not\ndepict an organizational chart.\n\n483\n00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.110\nAnd that's what that shaded\narea is trying to depict here,\n\n484\n00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.732\nis that any given person could\nexist in any given function.\n\n485\n00:26:20.732 --> 00:26:24.850\nOkay well that sums up everything\nabout service operations.\n\n486\n00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.910\nWe covered a lot of processes.\n\n487\n00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.110\nWe covered five processes.\n\n488\n00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:32.510\nWe did event management, incident,\nproblem, request fulfillment, and\n\n489\n00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.460\naccess management.\n\n490\n00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.960\nFive processes.\n\n491\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.400\nAnd we also did the four functions and\nyou see those here.\n\n492\n00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.780\nService desk, technical management,\napplication management and\n\n493\n00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.340\nIT operations management.\n\n494\n00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.380\nThat sums up service operations.\n\n495\n00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.090\nWe've got one more life cycle stage to go,\n\n496\n00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.640\nthat's called continued\nservice improvement.\n\n497\n00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.120\nYou'll see that in another\nepisode coming soon.\n\n498\n00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.460\n>> All right, Terry well great job man.\n\n499\n00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.900\nYou definitely know this stuff down pat\nand we are just benefiting from it,\n\n500\n00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.800\nI know I am.\n\n501\n00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.570\nAnybody that's spent any time in IT or\njust not even specifically IT,\n\n502\n00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.780\njust in management in general or\nin any kind of platform,\n\n503\n00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:11.030\nthis stuff does kind of bleed into\nregardless of what your background is.\n\n504\n00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:15.420\nWe focus in on IT obviously because\nthat's what ITIL is all about, but\n\n505\n00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.910\nit can help you regardless of\nwhat your background might be.\n\n506\n00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:22.230\nI'm just listening to you talking and\nI'm going, yeah,\n\n507\n00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.800\nI know exactly what you're talking about.\n\n508\n00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.330\nI've been through that, I've seen that.\n\n509\n00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.890\nI've worked with that, I've seen those\nmeetings, I know those managers,\n\n510\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.090\nI know exactly where you're going.\n\n511\n00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:34.530\nSo it's really cool that you put assist,\nor ITIL has, should I say?\n\n512\n00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.000\nITIL's put a system to it, for\nus to better understand that, and\n\n513\n00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.790\ntherefore better utilize it.\n\n514\n00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.660\nTerry again did a great job today,\nwe appreciate you stopping by.\n\n515\n00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.380\nWe appreciate you guys joining us,\n\n516\n00:27:44.380 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.510\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.708\nin today's episode we are moving forward\nwith our ITIL Foundation Series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:23.490\nYou know it, you love it,\nit's a lot of good times, and\n\n6\n00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.510\njoining us back in the revelries\nour good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n7\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.930\nTerry, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.480\n>> Thanks Daniel, glad to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.290\nWe certainly have covered\na lot of ground and\n\n10\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.910\nwe're nearing the end of\nthe Foundations course here.\n\n11\n00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.390\nWe've talked about strategy,\n\n12\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.050\nwe've talked about design, we've talked\nabout transition and operations.\n\n13\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.930\nAnd now we're moving on to\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n14\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.090\nIt's a shorter chapter, but that doesn't\nreflect just how important it is.\n\n15\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.860\nIn fact, CSI, Continual Service\nImprovement, can form the actual cultural\n\n16\n00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.860\nfoundation of how you actually adopt and\nadapt ITIL to your current environment.\n\n17\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.759\nSo, very important stuff here and\nlet's dig in.\n\n18\n00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:06.900\nSo here's what we're gonna be\ncovering in the CSI episode here.\n\n19\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.560\nObviously, we'll look at\nthe big picture of what CSI is\n\n20\n00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.840\ntrying to accomplish as a stage.\n\n21\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.660\nWe'll look at some key concepts,\n\n22\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.560\nagain it's always about vocabulary and\nsome good concepts here.\n\n23\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.360\nWe'll talk about the importance of\nmetrics, critical success factors,\n\n24\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.990\nkey performance indicators.\n\n25\n00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660\nWe'll look at the Deming Cycle,\n\n26\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.920\nwe'll look at an approach to\ncontinual service improvement and\n\n27\n00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.170\nwe'll also dive into the details of\na seven step improvement process.\n\n28\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.270\nSo that's where we're heading.\n\n29\n00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.600\nI think we should queue The Who and\n\n30\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.525\nthen you do the side with the glasses,\nCSI right?\n\n31\n00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:39.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The CSI.\n\n32\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.630\nYeah, exactly we need some neon\nlighting and stuff back there.\n\n33\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.143\n>> That's right.\n\n34\n00:01:44.143 --> 00:01:46.560\n>> The lighting stuff,\nwe can make that happen, that's right.\n\n35\n00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.920\nAll right, so\neffectively what CSI is trying to do and\n\n36\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.640\nwhile it is a stage of the life\ncycle it's always active.\n\n37\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.590\nSo it's embedded in all the other stages.\n\n38\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.850\nIt's not a separate stage in more that\nit's just integrated with all of them.\n\n39\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.930\nBecause certainly there could be\nopportunities to improve the processes and\n\n40\n00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.350\nservice strategy, the methodologies and\nservice design, transition and operations.\n\n41\n00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.370\nSo it's alive and well throughout all\nthe stages of the lifecycle, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.290\nSo effectively what it's trying to do is\nmake sure that everything is healthy.\n\n43\n00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.490\nThat the service management processes,\nthat the service management teams,\n\n44\n00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.270\nthe skill sets, the maturity of\nall the processes are up, etc.\n\n45\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.796\nThis principle of being able to define,\nmeasure, control, and\n\n46\n00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:42.244\nmanage is not necessarily good for\nthe exam.\n\n47\n00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:46.988\nBut pretty effective in understanding\njust how important it is that you measure\n\n48\n00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:48.660\nthings, right?\n\n49\n00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.370\nYou can't hope to manage\nwhat you can't control,\n\n50\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.660\nyou can't hope to control what you can't\nmeasure, is really the foundation here.\n\n51\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.990\nAnd of course, you have to define what it\nis you're going to be measuring right?\n\n52\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.470\nSo at the basis of continuous service\nimprovement is the methodical\n\n53\n00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.090\napproach to measuring\njust how good you are and\n\n54\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.030\nthen moving the needle in\nthe right direction, right?\n\n55\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.000\nSo we'll talk about that\nas we move through.\n\n56\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.570\nTalk about critical success factors and\nkey performance indicators and\n\n57\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.857\ngive you some examples for\nhow that measurement plays out, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:28.495\nIt's a good idea to actually record\nyour ideas, right, of improvement.\n\n59\n00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:32.015\nIf you don't record what you\nthink might be an improvement,\n\n60\n00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:33.735\nchances are the improvement\njust slides away.\n\n61\n00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:35.005\nYou don't get around to it.\n\n62\n00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:38.652\nSo having a CSI register is an important\n\n63\n00:03:40.302 --> 00:03:43.082\nconstruction to have\nwithin your organization.\n\n64\n00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:47.212\nIt just gives you a focal point for\nideas that you're considering.\n\n65\n00:03:47.212 --> 00:03:51.318\nIt doesn't have to be complex, it could\nbe a spreadsheet, a SharePoint list,\n\n66\n00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:52.867\nit could be just very simple.\n\n67\n00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:58.280\nBut it becomes the touchstone,\nif you will, for your CSI culture.\n\n68\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.500\nYou come to the list,\nyou come to the register, I should say.\n\n69\n00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.840\nYou come to the CSI register,\nsee what ideas have been implemented,\n\n70\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.950\nwhich ones are still pending.\n\n71\n00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.360\nHave monthly meetings perhaps about it,\nweekly if you wish, right?\n\n72\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.440\nSo it gives you the ability to\nintelligently kinda beat the drum for\n\n73\n00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.370\nimprovement throughout the organization.\n\n74\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.621\nAnd of course this should be enabled by\na CSI manager, a capable CSI manager.\n\n75\n00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:26.567\nThat doesn't mean that you have to create\na special role in your organization called\n\n76\n00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:27.242\nCSI manager.\n\n77\n00:04:27.242 --> 00:04:32.182\nI should say it's a position, it's not\na job description, it's just a role\n\n78\n00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:36.748\nthat someone can play and to be\nthe champion of the initiatives, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:44.872\nAgain some key words, critical success\nfactors and key performance indicators.\n\n80\n00:04:44.872 --> 00:04:46.973\nThis a little bit over simplification but,\n\n81\n00:04:46.973 --> 00:04:49.658\ncritical success factors\nare often rendered in words.\n\n82\n00:04:49.658 --> 00:04:53.660\nAnd key performance indicators are where\nyou're talking about the measurements.\n\n83\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.867\nSo they're gonna have numbers\ninvolved in them, right?\n\n84\n00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:03.980\nCritical success factors are linked to\nthose areas that you must do well, right?\n\n85\n00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.920\nSo if you must be highly available.\n\n86\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.990\nSo maybe that's the words.\n\n87\n00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.440\nThe service must be highly available\n24 hours a day 7 days a week, right?\n\n88\n00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.770\nA key performance indicator for\nthat could be your availability metrics or\n\n89\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.675\nyour reliability metrics or\nmaintainability metrics, etc.\n\n90\n00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:23.620\nLet's give you some ideas here.\n\n91\n00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.390\nLook at some of these.\n\n92\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.850\nCritical success factor.\n\n93\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.420\nProtect IT services when making changes.\n\n94\n00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.848\nAnd the KPI could be 20% reduction\nin change-caused incidents.\n\n95\n00:05:35.848 --> 00:05:37.729\nA hyphen would help there probably.\n\n96\n00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.000\nIn incidents caused by change, right.\n\n97\n00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.690\nLowering cost of service provision,\nwe need to save money.\n\n98\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.668\nThat's considered\na critical success factor.\n\n99\n00:05:46.668 --> 00:05:51.240\nThen do 10% decrease in cost of\nservice provision, lower cost of\n\n100\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.980\ntransaction processor, lower supply\ncost or for the same service levels etc.\n\n101\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.070\nSo you get the idea that a critical\nsuccess factor is rendered in words.\n\n102\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.910\nAnd you're diving into\nthe actual measurements when you\n\n103\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.330\ntalk about key performance indicators.\n\n104\n00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.080\n>> So it's not just qualifying what\nwe consider, we were successful.\n\n105\n00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.080\nWe actually can quantify those things,\ngive it a metric, give it a number, and\n\n106\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.710\nsay did we hit that or didn't we.\n\n107\n00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.780\n>> Exactly, exactly right.\n\n108\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.860\nAnd if you look back\nat the previous slide,\n\n109\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.450\nwe see that KPI's can be quantitative and\nqualitative.\n\n110\n00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.580\nSo while we've been focusing on\nthe numbers, you need to think,\n\n111\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.810\nit's fairly simple when you hear it,\nyou can quantify qualitative assessments.\n\n112\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.902\nLike if you want to know how satisfied\nsomeone is with your service,\n\n113\n00:06:38.902 --> 00:06:40.650\nyou can ask them, are you satisfied?\n\n114\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.850\nOn a scale of one to five,\nsee the numbers coming out?\n\n115\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.340\nOn a scale of one to five,\nhow satisfied are you with the service?\n\n116\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.690\nAnd if you survey 100 people,\n\n117\n00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.360\nhow many of those people rated a 5 or\nrated a 4, or rated a 3?\n\n118\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.060\nSo you see how you can quantify those\nqualitative measurements, right?\n\n119\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.160\nSo even though you're going to render\nthese measurements in numbers,\n\n120\n00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.769\nyou can chase subjective data,\nif you will.\n\n121\n00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:09.119\n>> Right, it's interesting that that\nhappens cuz we think of objective and\n\n122\n00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:11.398\nsubjective data,\nnever the 'twain shall meet!\n\n123\n00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:11.940\n>> Right.\n\n124\n00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.413\n>> But no, we can actually get an idea of,\nwell, yes, they have a subjective\n\n125\n00:07:16.413 --> 00:07:21.099\nidea of this, but we can tell you how\nmany people have this same subjectiveness\n\n126\n00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:22.005\n>> Exactly right.\n\n127\n00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:23.602\n>> and quantify that.\n\n128\n00:07:23.602 --> 00:07:24.370\nThat's very cool.\n\n129\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.010\n>> Exactly.\n\n130\n00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.160\nSo the KPI is gonna be quantitative\nin that it's gonna be a number but\n\n131\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.760\nyou can measure qualitative\nthings with it.\n\n132\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.770\nSo good discussion, all right.\n\n133\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.310\nAnother keyword is the word, baseline.\n\n134\n00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.010\nBaseline is just a snapshot in time,\nwhere are we right now, right.\n\n135\n00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:46.590\nSo if you do a survey three months ago and\nestablished the baseline three months ago,\n\n136\n00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.780\nhow many people said,\nyes, I like the service.\n\n137\n00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.560\nAnd it was 45%.\n\n138\n00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.137\nYou could come up with a KPI of\na 20% increase quarterly, right,\n\n139\n00:07:56.137 --> 00:07:59.447\nin the numbers of people\nthat liked the service.\n\n140\n00:07:59.447 --> 00:08:03.169\nSo, you measure the next quarter,\nhow many people liked it, right?\n\n141\n00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:04.491\nAnd you have another baseline.\n\n142\n00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:05.775\nRight?\nSo it's just that\n\n143\n00:08:05.775 --> 00:08:08.223\nsnapshot in time as you're going through.\n\n144\n00:08:08.223 --> 00:08:11.260\nIt gives you a point for\nlater comparison, right?\n\n145\n00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.680\nIf you measure now and\n\n146\n00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.840\nthen you go do something to change your\nservice to make it more satisfying.\n\n147\n00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.130\nYou come back and measure again, right?\n\n148\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.960\nIt's a way to show progress\ntoward the goal, right?\n\n149\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.680\nSo baselines are important,\nyou need to know where you are now so\n\n150\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.200\nyou know where you're going to\nhave a target for you when I go.\n\n151\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.550\n>> Quick question Terry,\n\n152\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.910\nbaselines have always been kind\nof a strange thing for me.\n\n153\n00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.680\nBecause, obviously\nthe baseline can change.\n\n154\n00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.000\nHow do we know when\nthe baseline has changed, and\n\n155\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.790\nit's not, I mean,\nhow do we make that happen?\n\n156\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:44.400\nYou know what I mean?\n\n157\n00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.410\n>> Good question.\n\n158\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.660\nIt's a very good question.\n\n159\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.750\nLook at it this way.\n\n160\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.200\nIt really is,\na baseline is the snapshot right now.\n\n161\n00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:51.890\nRight?\n\n162\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.490\nThree months from now,\nyou have a new baseline.\n\n163\n00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.560\nIf you take another picture,\nthen you've taken another snapshot.\n\n164\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.620\nSo baselines are something\nthat you measure against, and\n\n165\n00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.140\nestablish new ones as you go.\n\n166\n00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.959\n>> Are they typically aggregate, where we\ntake multiple snapshots and say okay well\n\n167\n00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:10.907\nthe the average from the snapshots equals\nthis and therefore that's our baseline?\n\n168\n00:09:10.907 --> 00:09:14.270\nThat way we eliminate spikes and valleys?\n\n169\n00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:14.940\n>> Well certainly,\n\n170\n00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.920\nyour measurement methods could include\nthose kind of variants, absolutely, right.\n\n171\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.776\nBut in it's simplest,\na baseline is a single snapshot.\n\n172\n00:09:22.776 --> 00:09:25.601\n>> And that's how is going\nto expect us to [CROSSTALK]\n\n173\n00:09:25.601 --> 00:09:26.480\n>> Exactly right.\n\n174\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.858\n>> That's the most important thing.\n\n175\n00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:30.685\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, right and if you were,\n\n176\n00:09:30.685 --> 00:09:34.753\nI mean these concepts come\nout of manufacturing and\n\n177\n00:09:34.753 --> 00:09:40.998\nwhen you're talking about the tolerance\nof accuracy in a bolt being formed and\n\n178\n00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:45.840\nyou've only got microns of variation,\nright?\n\n179\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.360\nYou might established baselines\nequality minute by minute,\n\n180\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.630\nas the production line keeps coming.\n\n181\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.850\nYou might have ways to doing that.\n\n182\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.050\nSo, it is a construction that, for\n\n183\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.140\nthe test purposes,\nit's a snapshot in time right now.\n\n184\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.520\nIf you happen to take 50 snapshots\nover the course of the year,\n\n185\n00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.430\nthen you have to have 50 baselines, which\nare always moving toward that, right.\n\n186\n00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.963\n>> So you can have multiple baselines,\nreally.\n\n187\n00:10:08.963 --> 00:10:09.660\n>> Absolutely.\n\n188\n00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.592\n>> Immediate baseline and\nan overall shing baseline.\n\n189\n00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:13.669\n>> Absolutely.\n\n190\n00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:14.717\n>> Baselines are everywhere.\n\n191\n00:10:14.717 --> 00:10:16.055\n[LAUGH]\n>> Could be that way.\n\n192\n00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:16.937\nExactly right.\n\n193\n00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:18.240\n>> Okay.\n\n194\n00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.362\n>> Now the high level baselines are again,\n\n195\n00:10:20.362 --> 00:10:25.020\nnot like a manufacturing where you're\nexamining every bolt as it comes off.\n\n196\n00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.404\nIf you imagine base lining against, you\nknow how effective is the service desk.\n\n197\n00:10:29.404 --> 00:10:34.127\nYou could baseline that, in the first\nquarter they responded within five\n\n198\n00:10:34.127 --> 00:10:38.930\nminutes and they resolved within two days,\n80% of our tickets.\n\n199\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.150\nWell, let's make that ninety percent,\nthat's really good, let's make that 90%,\n\n200\n00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.590\nthat's our goal.\n\n201\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.820\nEstablishing that baseline\nof 80% is important,\n\n202\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.700\nbecause you know where you are now.\n\n203\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.180\nAnd then you go do something to\nimprove that, and you measure again.\n\n204\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.660\nMaybe you slip back to 70%.\n\n205\n00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.190\nWell, you have a new baseline that happens\n\n206\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.760\nto have been the one that\nyou slid back on, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.960\nBut underneath all this is metrics.\n\n208\n00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.130\nRight.\nMetrics are the key to being able\n\n209\n00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.960\nto drive container service\napprove it's data driven.\n\n210\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.090\nIt's not just someone's\nsubjective idea right?\n\n211\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.560\n>> We think the service\ncould be better right?\n\n212\n00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.220\nIt's measuring how good that service is or\n\n213\n00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.740\nhow good that process is or\nhow good the technology is working, right?\n\n214\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.020\nIn fact, that leads us to the TPS reports.\n\n215\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.370\nIf you don't get this question right\non the exam you get a red- Stapler and\n\n216\n00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.750\nthe basement office.\n\n217\n00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.606\nAnd if you don't get that joke,\nyou need to see Office Space.\n\n218\n00:11:36.606 --> 00:11:37.680\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n219\n00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.230\nIt's your homework today.\n\n220\n00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.820\n>> Yeah that's right.\n\n221\n00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.645\n>> Go watch Office Space.\n\n222\n00:11:41.645 --> 00:11:42.710\n[LAUGH]\n>> Cuz if you haven't seen it,\n\n223\n00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.085\nyou have a hole in your life,\nthat's right.\n\n224\n00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:48.278\n>> [LAUGH] It's a red\nstapler-shaped hole in your heart.\n\n225\n00:11:48.278 --> 00:11:50.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly right.\n\n226\n00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.310\nBut again, the The TPS reports,\nso to speak.\n\n227\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.030\nThe technology, process,\nand service metrics.\n\n228\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.360\nSo again, here's the ITIL\nlibrarian's done a really good job,\n\n229\n00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.430\nof distilling the universe of metrics\ninto three broad categories, right?\n\n230\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.510\nTechnology metrics,\nhow often is that server up, right?\n\n231\n00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.610\nHow often did it fail, right?\n\n232\n00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.090\nThe adverse of that, right?\n\n233\n00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.960\nHow effective is our network?\n\n234\n00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.990\nHow many packets were dropped by the\nnetwork etcetera and then process metrics.\n\n235\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.280\nHow effective is our\ninstant management process?\n\n236\n00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.860\nAre we quick at responding,\nare we quick at resolving?\n\n237\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.710\nHow good is our change management process?\n\n238\n00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.260\nPick a process.\n\n239\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.590\nAnd you could measure it's effectiveness,\nright.\n\n240\n00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.840\nSo, technology, process, and\nthen end to end metrics.\n\n241\n00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:42.950\nService metrics are all the above,\ntechnology, process and then other things.\n\n242\n00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.800\nJust how good is the service, and\n\n243\n00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.110\nyou can measure the service\nend to end in that regard.\n\n244\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:52.050\n>> Terry, does there ever come a time when\nwe're just basically, so we can develop\n\n245\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.530\nthese baselines, we can develop\nmetrics for many of our processes or\n\n246\n00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.330\njust trying to get ideas so\nthat we can create goals and do that.\n\n247\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.740\nIs there every comes a time where\nwe're just doing too much of that?\n\n248\n00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.001\nIs there a happy medium?\n\n249\n00:13:03.001 --> 00:13:03.764\n>> [LAUGH] Good point.\n\n250\n00:13:03.764 --> 00:13:06.590\n>> Now we're just overworking ourselves\nand we never get past this point.\n\n251\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.650\n>> It's a great point, in fact as you\nconsider your critical success factors and\n\n252\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:16.920\nkey performance indicators you should have\ntwo to five critical success factors and\n\n253\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.690\nunderpinning those two to five KPIs.\n\n254\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.618\nSo if you consider that then\nwe've got on the low end.\n\n255\n00:13:24.618 --> 00:13:28.850\nTwo critical assess factors\neach with two KPIs.\n\n256\n00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.340\nThen you're chasing four measurement.\n\n257\n00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.180\n>> Right.\nAt the other end of that spectrum,\n\n258\n00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.030\nwe're looking at five\ncritical assess factors.\n\n259\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.230\nEach with five KPIs.\n\n260\n00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.900\nThen you're chasing 25 things.\n\n261\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.650\nRight?\n\n262\n00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.650\nThat level of complexity you can spend\na lot a time just measuring things.\n\n263\n00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:43.250\n>> Right?\n\n264\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.210\nAnd get lost in the measurements.\n\n265\n00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.250\nSo this needs to be a measured approach,\nright?\n\n266\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:53.920\nYou need to do this in a way that is\nnot a burden on the organization.\n\n267\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.970\nBut there's gonna be\nan interesting balance, right?\n\n268\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.665\nYou need to be Be able to measure, sure.\n\n269\n00:13:57.665 --> 00:14:00.995\nYou need to be able to measure\nthe right things, right.\n\n270\n00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:04.435\nAnd it needs to be a balance on how\nmuch effort it takes to get that.\n\n271\n00:14:04.435 --> 00:14:09.105\nNow certainly, there are IT service\nmanagement suites, you know software\n\n272\n00:14:09.105 --> 00:14:12.810\nsuites, applications out there that make\nthis measurement a little bit easier.\n\n273\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.460\nBut they're not fully baked and\nfully engineered when you buy them.\n\n274\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.950\nSo, even if you buy these good tool sets,\nand\n\n275\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:22.690\nyou need to have a good integrated tool\nset, getting that data out of them\n\n276\n00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.840\nis gonna be something that's gonna\nbe an important endeavor for\n\n277\n00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.950\nyour organization so that you get\nthe rights metrics at the right time.\n\n278\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.500\nA fair question, right.\n\n279\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.110\nAll right,\nanother good test taking moment here for\n\n280\n00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.650\nyour test takers,\nmemorization opportunity here.\n\n281\n00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.940\nThe Deming Cycle.\n\n282\n00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:49.620\nDr. Deming helped revolutionize the car\nmanufacturing industry in Japan and\n\n283\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.360\njust continual and gradual improvement\nin their manufacturing processes.\n\n284\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.810\nHe wrote volumes on how to do this well.\n\n285\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.590\nHow to measure, how to squeeze\nout the highest level of quality.\n\n286\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.470\nAnd do it efficiently, right?\n\n287\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.040\nAnd although he's written volumes,\n\n288\n00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.040\nhe gets his name associated\nwith four verbs, right.\n\n289\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.900\nPlan, do, check, act.\n\n290\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.610\nIt's beautiful in its simplicity, also\nvery powerful in its simplicity, right.\n\n291\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.650\nThe verbs, act and do,\nkinda sound synonymous in many ways.\n\n292\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.020\nBut the way I keep these\nletters straight is that they\n\n293\n00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.750\nare in reverse alphabetical order.\n\n294\n00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.350\nPlan, do, check, act.\n\n295\n00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.220\nThat might help you on an exam if again\nreverse alphabetical order there.\n\n296\n00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.340\nBut the concept is simple.\n\n297\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.960\nYou plan an improvement, you have an idea.\n\n298\n00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.900\nSo you plan it, and\nyou go to implement this improvement.\n\n299\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.650\nAnd then you do the improvement,\nyou make it happen.\n\n300\n00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.500\nAnd then you check, did you move\nthe needle in the right direction.\n\n301\n00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.400\nRight?\n\n302\n00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.590\nAnd then the action is how do\nwe keep the momentum going?\n\n303\n00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.060\nHow do we either spread the gain,\nor retain this gain?\n\n304\n00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.940\nSo we did a good job, we made it, we\nmoved the needle on the right direction.\n\n305\n00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:57.938\nWe're doing better.\n\n306\n00:15:57.938 --> 00:16:00.926\nHow are we gonna retain that or\nhow we're gonna spread it?\n\n307\n00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:01.558\nRight?\n\n308\n00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:02.934\nAnd then back again.\n\n309\n00:16:02.934 --> 00:16:04.074\nIt never ends.\n\n310\n00:16:04.074 --> 00:16:05.960\nAnd this idea of gradual and\n\n311\n00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.970\ncontinual improvement is at\nthe crux of this as well.\n\n312\n00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.667\nSo you don't have to be brilliant all at\nonce, but have a culture where you're\n\n313\n00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:19.525\ncontinually getting better every day,\nevery week, every month, every year.\n\n314\n00:16:19.525 --> 00:16:24.401\nThe time scales can certainly be\nconsidered on an annual level,\n\n315\n00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:27.210\na quarterly level, monthly level.\n\n316\n00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.303\nThis time based thing, but\ngradual and continual and\n\n317\n00:16:30.303 --> 00:16:33.760\nthen that little chalk block\nyou see at the bottom.\n\n318\n00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.440\nIs really that action part.\n\n319\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.820\nHow are we gonna keep this momentum going?\n\n320\n00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.240\nBecause if you start\nmeasuring people's behavior,\n\n321\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.280\nhow they participate in the process,\nyou're gonna get a spike up probably.\n\n322\n00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.190\nYou're paying attention to this?\n\n323\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.080\nOkay, I will be better.\n\n324\n00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.844\nI'll watch fewer YouTubes at work.\n\n325\n00:16:48.844 --> 00:16:50.611\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n326\n00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:53.550\n>> I will get on this and\nI'll try to be better.\n\n327\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.920\nAnd so if you're gonna start measuring\nfolks, you probably get a good spike, but\n\n328\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.900\nhow are you gonna keep\nthat momentum going?\n\n329\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:06.460\nYou need to bed this improvement so\nthat it lasts, okay?\n\n330\n00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.343\nSo, based on that very simple Plan,\nDo, Check, Act,\n\n331\n00:17:10.343 --> 00:17:13.579\nour two other things\nwe're gonna talk about.\n\n332\n00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:17.110\nWe're gonna go an improvement approach,\nand an improvement process.\n\n333\n00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.380\nThe CSI approach and the CSI process.\n\n334\n00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.340\nAnd here's a look at that approach,\nalso simple.\n\n335\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.020\nAnd while the circle has\nkind of been squared off,\n\n336\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.480\nplease note how this graphic\nis really showing a circle.\n\n337\n00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.810\nIt's moving around.\n\n338\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.700\nRight.\n\n339\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.230\nGet my laser pointer\nback in the game here.\n\n340\n00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.491\nRight, you can see, again, it's kind\nof square, but this is also a cycle.\n\n341\n00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:43.190\nSo the CSI approach is\nbased on that Deming cycle.\n\n342\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.590\nIt's just asking at a high\nlevel a few more questions.\n\n343\n00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.280\nAnd I think this makes sense and\n\n344\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.674\nit's worth memorizing these\nsteps of the approach, right?\n\n345\n00:17:51.674 --> 00:17:52.719\nAnd there's six of them.\n\n346\n00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.140\nWhat is the vision?\n\n347\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.320\nAn important question to ask before\nyou embark on an improvement idea\n\n348\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.660\nis why do we even care about\nthis improvement idea?\n\n349\n00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.630\nTouching back to why the business cares,\nwhat the outcome is, and\n\n350\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.950\nwhy it's important to do what we're doing.\n\n351\n00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:14.220\nI've certainly been involved improvement\nideas where we didn't ask that question\n\n352\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:14.840\nand we did good.\n\n353\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.498\nWe improved something and\nthe customer didn't even care.\n\n354\n00:18:17.498 --> 00:18:18.608\nRight?\n\n355\n00:18:18.608 --> 00:18:20.050\nJust an example.\n\n356\n00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:26.930\nI had 30 services under my remit and one\nof them showed pretty poor availability.\n\n357\n00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.780\nI looked at the compare\nsystem other services and\n\n358\n00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.210\nthis one was really,\nseemed a lot worse, right?\n\n359\n00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.700\nSo I asked my team,\nwhat's going on with this,\n\n360\n00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.020\ngive me some data of what's going\non with this particular service.\n\n361\n00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.110\nI got a meeting with a customer next week,\nlets talk about this.\n\n362\n00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.210\nRight, so they gave me some good data and\nbasically,\n\n363\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.110\nit pointed out that the weekends\nwere the weakest link, that\n\n364\n00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.590\nthis service really failed more often on\nthe weekends than it did during the week.\n\n365\n00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.600\nSo I had that little bit of data,\n\n366\n00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.810\nnot much deeper when I went to the\ncustomer meeting the following week, and\n\n367\n00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.320\nthey said we don't care Terry,\nwe don't care about the weekends.\n\n368\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.190\nWe're a Monday through\nFriday nine to five shop,\n\n369\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.850\nand it's probably our own technicians just\nplaying with the back end stuff, right?\n\n370\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.550\nSo don't even worry about the weekends,\nright?\n\n371\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.780\nSo again I didn't waste a lot of\ntime thankfully on trying to improve\n\n372\n00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.190\nthe availability of that one.\n\n373\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.460\nBut I did simply forget\nthe basic question.\n\n374\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.800\nDoes the costumer care about this, right?\n\n375\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.820\nSo start with that question.\n\n376\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.980\nWhat is the vision?\n\n377\n00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.382\nAnd as you can see as we look at the other\nquestions you then need to say where\n\n378\n00:19:27.382 --> 00:19:28.099\nare we now?\n\n379\n00:19:28.099 --> 00:19:28.842\nWhere are we now?\n\n380\n00:19:28.842 --> 00:19:30.970\nThat's that baseline question, all right.\n\n381\n00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:31.639\nWhere are we now?\n\n382\n00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.860\nAnd after that, where do we wanna be.\n\n383\n00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.952\nRight?\nSo, if you're currently resolving 60% of\n\n384\n00:19:39.952 --> 00:19:45.793\nyour tickets within the agreed time,\nthat may be perceived as not so good.\n\n385\n00:19:45.793 --> 00:19:47.810\nAnd maybe you wanna get that to 80%.\n\n386\n00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.880\nSo, now you're talking about where\nyou wanna be, your measurable target.\n\n387\n00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.180\nYou got the baseline.\n\n388\n00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.090\nCurrently, 60% of our\ntickets are resolved.\n\n389\n00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.170\nWithin the agreed time.\n\n390\n00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.431\n>> It's better than the weatherman, right?\n\n391\n00:19:57.431 --> 00:19:58.723\n>> It's better than the weatherman,\ngood point.\n\n392\n00:19:58.723 --> 00:19:59.526\n>> He keeps his job.\n\n393\n00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:04.021\n[LAUGH]\n>> Good point.\n\n394\n00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:06.614\nAnd then where do you wanna be?\n\n395\n00:20:06.614 --> 00:20:08.866\nYou've agreed to do 80%.\n\n396\n00:20:08.866 --> 00:20:09.530\nYou're only at 60, so you kinda got\nthe target all ready understood.\n\n397\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.495\nThe measurable target is\nwe need to be at 80%,\n\n398\n00:20:11.495 --> 00:20:14.520\nnot 60% of our tickets\nneed resolved on time.\n\n399\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.450\nSo then you come up with the plan, right?\n\n400\n00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.600\nHow are we gonna get there?\n\n401\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.130\nYou define your service improvement plan.\n\n402\n00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.818\nYou define the approach you're gonna\ntake to moving that needle in the right\n\n403\n00:20:23.818 --> 00:20:24.460\ndirection.\n\n404\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.465\nSee how it sounds like plan-do-check-act?\n\n405\n00:20:26.465 --> 00:20:28.561\nRight?\nSo now you get to come up with your plan.\n\n406\n00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.170\nYou implement your plan, right?\n\n407\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.510\nAnd you see if you've moved\nthe needle in the right direction.\n\n408\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.800\nDid we get there, right?\n\n409\n00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.260\nSo you look at your measurements and\nmetrics again and\n\n410\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.720\nsee if you moved the needle right.\n\n411\n00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.308\n>> And you know what Terry, even if, and\nthis probably a philosophical point.\n\n412\n00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:47.157\nEven if 60% was an acceptable\nlevel of performance.\n\n413\n00:20:47.157 --> 00:20:50.935\nThat doesn't mean you can't strive\nto go higher because companies\n\n414\n00:20:50.935 --> 00:20:54.909\nthat continually do the same thing\nover and over again, they fall off,\n\n415\n00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:58.036\nand the company that does\nbetter will take their place.\n\n416\n00:20:58.036 --> 00:21:00.720\n>> That's a good point,\nyep, it is a good point.\n\n417\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.355\nAnd keep in mind remember we\ntalked about In earlier lessons,\n\n418\n00:21:03.355 --> 00:21:06.615\nwe talked about a service\nlevel management process that\n\n419\n00:21:06.615 --> 00:21:11.105\ndiscerns what the targets are and\nputs those targets in an SLA, right?\n\n420\n00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:14.905\nSo you already kinda have a road map\nof where you're supposed to go, right?\n\n421\n00:21:14.905 --> 00:21:19.154\nAnd if you are already at 80%,\nright, if you're whatever the agreed,\n\n422\n00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:21.661\nas you suggested, maybe 0.6% is fine.\n\n423\n00:21:21.661 --> 00:21:23.890\nThe customer's just satisfied with that,\nright?\n\n424\n00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.870\nThen, you wanna still continue to measure,\n\n425\n00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.000\nto make sure that you are meeting that,\nright?\n\n426\n00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.462\nAnd why not aspire for greater?\n\n427\n00:21:31.462 --> 00:21:32.534\n>> I agreed.\n\n428\n00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:33.497\n>> All right.\n\n429\n00:21:33.497 --> 00:21:35.502\nGood point.\n\n430\n00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:38.446\nSo again, this is just a summary of\nthose same things we just talked about,\n\n431\n00:21:38.446 --> 00:21:39.360\njust a minute.\n\n432\n00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.730\nFocus on the vision,\nwhere are we now, the baseline,\n\n433\n00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:46.750\nwhere do we wanna be, how do we get there,\nand did we get there.\n\n434\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.864\nAnd then how do we keep\nthat momentum going?\n\n435\n00:21:49.864 --> 00:21:52.005\nPretty straightforward,\nembedding that change.\n\n436\n00:21:55.298 --> 00:21:57.520\nSeven step improvement process.\n\n437\n00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:04.120\nSo we went from the four steps, which was\nthe dimming cycle, plan, do, check, act.\n\n438\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.299\nWe saw an approach.\n\n439\n00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:07.352\nIt has six steps that\nwere based on that and\n\n440\n00:22:07.352 --> 00:22:09.826\nthat approach is really\nkind of at the high level.\n\n441\n00:22:09.826 --> 00:22:13.863\nThis seven step improvement process\nactually get's into the details of\n\n442\n00:22:13.863 --> 00:22:15.085\nthe data.\n\n443\n00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:17.145\nWhat are we going to measure?\n\n444\n00:22:17.145 --> 00:22:22.330\nHow are we going to dig that data and\nmake it useful for us.\n\n445\n00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.731\nSo it really does get into the details.\n\n446\n00:22:23.731 --> 00:22:28.435\nAnd there's a great graphic that\ndescribes this as we see here.\n\n447\n00:22:28.435 --> 00:22:31.280\nFirst of all,\nyou'll see that plan do check act.\n\n448\n00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.800\nIt is based on the Deming cycle.\n\n449\n00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:39.645\nAnd you can see as you look at the squared\noff circle, it does go around and around.\n\n450\n00:22:39.645 --> 00:22:42.740\nSo it's still based on the Deming Cycle,\nright?\n\n451\n00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:47.010\nAnd I also like how they superimpose or,\nperhaps put it in the background, this\n\n452\n00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:54.050\nmigration or transformation of data and\nthe information into knowledge and wisdom.\n\n453\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.231\nDIKW.\n\n454\n00:22:55.231 --> 00:22:59.861\nYou might remember that from a previous\nepisode where we talked about the goal of\n\n455\n00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:03.390\nknowledge management is to\nenable this transformation.\n\n456\n00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.010\nThat we take data,\nwe transform it into knowledge,\n\n457\n00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.390\nI mean information, and we transform\nthat information into knowledge.\n\n458\n00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.289\nAnd then humans can take\nthat good knowledge and\n\n459\n00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:12.818\nhopefully do something wise with it.\n\n460\n00:23:12.818 --> 00:23:13.732\n>> Yes.\n\n461\n00:23:13.732 --> 00:23:16.135\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's the goal, right.\n\n462\n00:23:16.135 --> 00:23:20.990\nSo, an interesting characteristic\nhere about the seven step improvement\n\n463\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:25.844\nprocess is the first step, mirrors\nthe first step of the approach in that we\n\n464\n00:23:25.844 --> 00:23:31.000\nunderstand why we even care to move\nthis needle in some direction, right?\n\n465\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.070\nGetting back to the vision, the strategy.\n\n466\n00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.913\nWhat it is we're trying to accomplish,\nright.\n\n467\n00:23:35.913 --> 00:23:37.376\nSo, then after that,\n\n468\n00:23:37.376 --> 00:23:42.170\nthese next several steps are really\njust about the details of the data.\n\n469\n00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.600\nWhat are we going to chase?\n\n470\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:49.210\nWhat data must we collect to make\nthis improvement measurable?\n\n471\n00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.110\nWhat data do we need to get?\n\n472\n00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:56.002\nAnd therefore you then go chase the data\nat step three, you gather the data.\n\n473\n00:23:56.002 --> 00:23:58.500\nSo, let's just use\na hypothetical situation here.\n\n474\n00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:05.715\nLet's say that we are considering\nimproving availability of a Web service.\n\n475\n00:24:05.715 --> 00:24:06.818\nRight.\n\n476\n00:24:06.818 --> 00:24:08.320\nWe have a website.\n\n477\n00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.660\nLet's say it's used for retail sales and\nwe want to make it more available.\n\n478\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.320\nIt's suffered a couple of\noutages over the last few weeks.\n\n479\n00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.770\nWe want to improve\nthe availability of this.\n\n480\n00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.288\nSo image, if you will, Daniel,\nI'll use you as a sounding board.\n\n481\n00:24:22.288 --> 00:24:24.270\n>> Hit me [LAUGH].\n\n482\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.970\n>> What data might you need to go chase?\n\n483\n00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.024\nRegarding the availability\nof a Web service,\n\n484\n00:24:31.024 --> 00:24:33.773\nwhat goes into a retail store Web thread.\n\n485\n00:24:33.773 --> 00:24:34.610\n>> Yeah that is good.\n\n486\n00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.260\nIt could probably be a network traffic.\n\n487\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.420\n>> Good point.\n>> It is on the website,\n\n488\n00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.597\nkind of things like Web traffic.\n\n489\n00:24:40.597 --> 00:24:42.370\n>> Good point, so\nyou need to know the network traffic.\n\n490\n00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.870\nHow many hits its getting at\nwhat times a day, perhaps right?\n\n491\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:50.190\nSo you want to go get the basic data is\nthe number of hits on which pages, right?\n\n492\n00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:53.450\nYou might wanna get some server logs,\nright?\n\n493\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.411\nMaybe some application logs?\n\n494\n00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:57.320\n>> If there's a database,\ndatabase transactions.\n\n495\n00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.330\n>> Maybe database transaction, exactly.\n\n496\n00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.850\nSo you see it could potentially go and\n\n497\n00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.710\nget a lot of different data\nfrom lots of different sources.\n\n498\n00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.220\nSo the gathering of the data is one thing,\nright?\n\n499\n00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.890\nBut then you're probably gonna\nhave to process some of that data.\n\n500\n00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:14.120\nSo maybe you're not worried\nabout that second Saturday\n\n501\n00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.040\nlast month where you knew you\nhad a data center outage.\n\n502\n00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.820\nYou knew you had a problem.\n\n503\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.100\nSo that's kind of assignable cause, right?\n\n504\n00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.760\nWe're gonna leave that one out of our\ndata because we know about that one.\n\n505\n00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.180\n>> That's an anomaly.\n\n506\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.500\n>> That's an anomaly, exactly.\n\n507\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.620\nAssignable cause, right, exactly.\n\n508\n00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.960\nSo you start normalizing the data.\n\n509\n00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.370\nGet that stuff out of there and\nfocus on the real things, right?\n\n510\n00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:38.020\nSo, after you've processed it to\nget rid of some of that stuff,\n\n511\n00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.600\nyou can then analyze it and\ntry to do something with that data.\n\n512\n00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.982\nNow you see how you're turning\ninformation in to knowledge now.\n\n513\n00:25:44.982 --> 00:25:50.640\nSo maybe, discerned that it really was\nthe transactional part of the database.\n\n514\n00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.970\nThe network was fine.\n\n515\n00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.050\nThere was no issues there, right?\n\n516\n00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.000\nThe network's fine.\n\n517\n00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.900\nThe application was ready, but where it\nreally slowed down was when trying to get\n\n518\n00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.120\nthis return back from the database.\n\n519\n00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.618\nThat is really slow, right?\n\n520\n00:26:01.618 --> 00:26:05.443\nSo maybe you need to recompile your\nindexes like the good old LMS manager in\n\n521\n00:26:05.443 --> 00:26:06.860\na few episodes ago.\n\n522\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.700\nCould be.\nSo you come up with a plan.\n\n523\n00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.080\nYou come up with a plan, right?\n\n524\n00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.200\nBased on that analysis,\nyou come up with your presentation.\n\n525\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:15.715\nWhat are we gonna do with this?\n\n526\n00:26:15.715 --> 00:26:19.860\nAll right, you present your findings,\nyou come up with a plan, and\n\n527\n00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.700\nthen you implement the plan.\n\n528\n00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.405\nAnd then rinse and repeat.\n\n529\n00:26:24.405 --> 00:26:24.985\n>> That's right.\n>> Did\n\n530\n00:26:24.985 --> 00:26:26.940\nyou move the needle in\nthe right direction?\n\n531\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.470\nRight, check your availability.\n\n532\n00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.590\nAnd maybe you did squeeze\nsome more availability out.\n\n533\n00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.247\nYou got some, good.\nBut\n\n534\n00:26:31.247 --> 00:26:34.315\nyou need to go do some more\nresearch on the next round and\n\n535\n00:26:34.315 --> 00:26:39.240\nmake sure you're gonna keep that\nmomentum going in the right direction.\n\n536\n00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.307\nSo let me give you some test\ntaking clues about how to keep,\n\n537\n00:26:43.307 --> 00:26:46.632\nfirst the approach\nseparate from the process.\n\n538\n00:26:46.632 --> 00:26:49.390\nThey both have the same starting place for\ninstance,\n\n539\n00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.778\nthey both start with why we care,\nthe vision,\n\n540\n00:26:51.778 --> 00:26:55.900\nthe business outcome we're trying to help,\nthose kind of things, all right?\n\n541\n00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.935\nIt starts with understanding why we\neven care about this improvement.\n\n542\n00:26:59.935 --> 00:27:04.765\nSo the approach, and the process start at\nthe same place, why we even care, right?\n\n543\n00:27:04.765 --> 00:27:09.025\nNow, this particular process deals\nwith going and getting the data.\n\n544\n00:27:09.025 --> 00:27:12.600\nSo you have to start with defining\nwhat you need to get, right?\n\n545\n00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.240\nAnd I think you can probably keep straight\nthat you need to gather data before you\n\n546\n00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.520\ncan process it, right?\n\n547\n00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.760\nSo at least for me, knowing that\ndefining what I need to capture,\n\n548\n00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.820\nwas the one I kind of forgot.\n\n549\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.120\nBecause I just kind of thought\nwell that was a given.\n\n550\n00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:28.980\nWell it's not a given.\n\n551\n00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.350\nIt's right here you need\nto remember that one.\n\n552\n00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.630\nBut then I could remember these\nnext three were about the data.\n\n553\n00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.280\nThese gather processing and\n\n554\n00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.610\nanalyzing that those steps come\nbefore you actually present it.\n\n555\n00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.900\nHonestly, there are seven steps.\n\n556\n00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.010\nJust rote memorization's gonna help you\nin putting them in the right order.\n\n557\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.820\nBut remember the first one, whether it's\nfor the approach or for the process,\n\n558\n00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.810\nthe first step is always,\nwhy do we even care?\n\n559\n00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:55.000\nWhat's the vision?\n\n560\n00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.390\nWhat's the strategy?\n\n561\n00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.390\nWhy does this make sense?\n\n562\n00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.640\nRight, that's what that's about.\n\n563\n00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.580\nSo we cover quite a bit there, right?\n\n564\n00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.830\nWe covered the process, the seven steps.\n\n565\n00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.050\nWe covered the approach, the six steps.\n\n566\n00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:11.420\nAnd we covered the Deming cycle,\nthose plan, do, check, act, right?\n\n567\n00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.800\nAnd we also dealt with some concepts\nof key performance indicators.\n\n568\n00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.780\nThat support critical success factors.\n\n569\n00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.750\nRight and we put all that in\nthe context of measurement.\n\n570\n00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:27.460\nWe need to measure where we are,\na baseline, so we know where we wanna go.\n\n571\n00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.290\n>> Kind of makes sense, if you don't\nhave any way to gauge whether or not,\n\n572\n00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.130\nyou're doing better or worse,\nyou're just spinning your wheels.\n\n573\n00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.681\n>> Exactly right, and\nit's a data driven approach.\n\n574\n00:28:35.681 --> 00:28:36.420\n>> Yeah.\n\n575\n00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.990\n>> And one you can easily\npresent executives to buy in on.\n\n576\n00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.502\nI say easily, noting's easy, necessarily,\nbut you'd have a data driven approach,\n\n577\n00:28:42.502 --> 00:28:43.313\nnot just a feeling.\n\n578\n00:28:43.313 --> 00:28:47.170\nIt's something you can actually show,\nso it becomes more methodical.\n\n579\n00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.860\nA bit more scientific, if you will.\n\n580\n00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.880\nMethodical approach to\nimproving your services.\n\n581\n00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.860\n>> I like that.\nYou don't feel that you're doing better.\n\n582\n00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.660\nYou know you are doing better.\n\n583\n00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.575\n>> Exactly right.\n\n584\n00:28:55.575 --> 00:28:57.830\nSo, that's CSI.\n\n585\n00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:58.960\nContinued Service Improvement.\n\n586\n00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.940\nAgain, it was kinda a short\nlesson in that, but\n\n587\n00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.340\nit kinda portrays just\nhow important it is.\n\n588\n00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.953\nCSI Is a critical cultural advancement,\nif you will, that you can take on.\n\n589\n00:29:08.953 --> 00:29:14.227\nAnd in fact, you can use CSI\nprinciples in your adoption and\n\n590\n00:29:14.227 --> 00:29:17.290\nadaptation of ITIL itself.\n\n591\n00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.910\n>> Obviously CSI, very important for\nus, if you wanna continue to grow.\n\n592\n00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.940\nWant to continue to do better,\nreach new markets,\n\n593\n00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.250\nthings of that nature,\nthis is what you're gonna need to do.\n\n594\n00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.674\nAnd if you wanna pass the ITIL exam,\n\n595\n00:29:26.674 --> 00:29:29.347\nyou're gonna need to rote memorization\nquite a few things there.\n\n596\n00:29:29.347 --> 00:29:32.900\nSo get the flash cards handy and\nstart working.\n\n597\n00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.660\nI know it's not that fun,\nbut it does work very well.\n\n598\n00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.994\nWe always like to say around here,\nrepetition breeds retention.\n\n599\n00:29:37.994 --> 00:29:39.150\n>> Exactly.\n\n600\n00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.240\n>> So make sure you jump on that.\n\n601\n00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.680\nTerry, awesome stuff today.\n\n602\n00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.730\nThank you so much for\nenlightening us to the CSI model there.\n\n603\n00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.130\nThat being said,\nlooks like it's time for us to sign off.\n\n604\n00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.870\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n605\n00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:52.870\n>> Thanks, Terry Decker.\n\n606\n00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:53.429\n>> We'll see you next

prep.\n\n3\n00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.806\nWe're going to be focusing in on Sample\nPaper C, and here to help us out and\n\n4\n00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:14.350\nto take us through this is\ngonna be Mister Terry Decker.\n\n5\n00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.620\nTerry, tell us what we're doing here.\n\n6\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.790\n&gt;&gt; Well, this particular episode assumes\nthat you've gone through the course,\n\n7\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.540\nthat you've studied.\n\n8\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.340\nAnd perhaps you've even gone through the\npractice exam already, the Sample Paper C.\n\n9\n00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.270\nIf not, that's okay,\nthis would be just fine.\n\n10\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.550\nI'm gonna go through, rather quickly,\nthese 40 questions, giving\n\n11\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.240\nyou the correct answer and giving you\nsome rationale for that correct answer.\n\n12\n00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.500\nIf you've forgotten,\nthese things are available for download.\n\n13\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.340\nJust go up to the upper right-hand\ncorner of the interface and\n\n14\n00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.900\nyou can download these.\n\n15\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.940\nSo let's dig in.\n\n16\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.900\nFirst of all, just gonna be showing\nyou on the screen as these go through.\n\n17\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.410\nYou'll see my smiling\nface in the bottom there.\n\n18\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.659\nWhich is not a source of best practice?\n\n19\n00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.309\nYou may recall that\nthis was a graphic that\n\n20\n00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.680\nin the upper left hand corner\nit had sources of best practice.\n\n21\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.630\nAnd the other side it had\nenablers of best practice.\n\n22\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.880\nTechnology is one of the enablers\nalong with people, right?\n\n23\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.910\nBut these others, standards,\nacademic research, and\n\n24\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.150\ninternal experience is kinda\nwhere ideas come from.\n\n25\n00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.310\nAnd that's where sources of best\npractice come from for those areas.\n\n26\n00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.204\nSo B is correct because it is\nnot a source of best practice.\n\n27\n00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:28.950\nOkay, which three\nare the characteristics of ITIL guidance\n\n28\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.378\nthat help make it successful?\n\n29\n00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:35.359\nPretty straightforward here,\nit's just rote memorization.\n\n30\n00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.860\nThe answer is C, vendor neutral,\nnon-prescriptive, and best practice.\n\n31\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.929\nJust pretty much straight up, nothing\nreally conceptual other than memorization\n\n32\n00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.089\nhere, but definitely worthy memorizing.\n\n33\n00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.270\nWhat is the ITIL term for\ncostumers of an IT service provider\n\n34\n00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.810\nwho purchase services as\nagreed in a legal contract?\n\n35\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.890\nITIL describes these as\nexternal customers, right?\n\n36\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370\nOf course they're valued,\ncertainly not internal.\n\n37\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.220\nAnd the distinction between strategic or\n\n38\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.510\ntactical customers is not\nthe operating principle here.\n\n39\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.427\nExternal customers is the correct answer.\n\n40\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.947\nWhich is not defined as\npart of every process?\n\n41\n00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:22.490\nThe answer to this would be C, functions.\n\n42\n00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.823\nRoles, inputs and outputs, and metrics\nare certainly part of every process.\n\n43\n00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:33.690\nIn which area would ITIL complementary\nguidance provide assistance?\n\n44\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.650\nSo this is talking not about the five core\nbooks, but the complementary guidance.\n\n45\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.630\nAnd this is an example of one of those\nquestions that's a multiple choice inside\n\n46\n00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.320\na multiple choice.\n\n47\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.450\nSo you have to evaluate 1 through 4 and\nthen pick the right pair.\n\n48\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.790\nSo the test makers get\na little clever with this.\n\n49\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.270\nObviously, it makes it\na bit more difficult.\n\n50\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.900\nBut in this case the answer\nto this one is 1 and 4.\n\n51\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.270\nAdapting best practices for\nspecific industry sectors is\n\n52\n00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.460\nwhat complementary guidance\nprovides assistance on.\n\n53\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.656\nAnd integrating ITIL with other operating\nmodels such as project management or\n\n54\n00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:09.469\nLean Sigma or even ISO standards,\nthose types of things.\n\n55\n00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:16.720\nWhich is an objective\nof service transition?\n\n56\n00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.938\nService transition is an entire stage,\nnot a specific process, so\n\n57\n00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:23.166\nyou're gonna be looking for\na rather broad answer in this example.\n\n58\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.740\nTo ensure that service change creates\nthe expected business value, right?\n\n59\n00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.790\nThe other ones have obvious\nother processes involved or\n\n60\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.980\nother stages involved.\n\n61\n00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.420\nTo negotiate service levels for new\nservices, that's service level management.\n\n62\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.840\nThat does negotiation.\n\n63\n00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.210\nTo reduce the impact of business critical\nservices outages on key services.\n\n64\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.110\nThat happens in service operations.\n\n65\n00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.410\nAnd to plan and\nmanage entries in service catalogue, well,\n\n66\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.260\nthat happens in service design as a stage.\n\n67\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.790\nBut very specifically it\nhappens in a process called\n\n68\n00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.730\nservice catalogue management.\n\n69\n00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.160\nSo you can eliminate the other ones,\n\n70\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.875\nleading you back to B\nas the correct answer.\n\n71\n00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.810\n[BLANK AUDIO].\n\n72\n00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.384\nWhich lifecycle stage ensures that the\nimpact of service outages is minimized on\n\n73\n00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:12.610\na day-to-day basis?\n\n74\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.160\nWe kinda got a hint on\nthe previous question about this.\n\n75\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.681\nIt's service operations is\nthe lifecycle stage, right?\n\n76\n00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.552\nIt's dealing with\nthe day-to-day operation.\n\n77\n00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.903\nWhich is the best description\nof a service catalogue?\n\n78\n00:04:36.157 --> 00:04:41.505\nIt's D, the part of the service\nportfolio that is visible to customers.\n\n79\n00:04:41.505 --> 00:04:44.095\nThe other pieces here\nare simply just wrong.\n\n80\n00:04:44.095 --> 00:04:46.994\nA document used by IT staff to identify\nactivities that must be performed?\n\n81\n00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:51.915\nNope, we're talking about services here,\nright, not activities.\n\n82\n00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:53.837\nA list of all service level agreements?\n\n83\n00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:57.590\nService level agreements might be\nreferenced in the catalogue, but\n\n84\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.030\nit's not a listing.\n\n85\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.875\nThe catalogue is not a listing\nof these agreements.\n\n86\n00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:04.460\nAnd a list of business requirements\nthat have not yet become services?\n\n87\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.590\nAlso, that's a business requirements\ndocument, not an entire service catalogue.\n\n88\n00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:13.386\nWhich of the following is concerned\nwith policy and direction?\n\n89\n00:05:13.386 --> 00:05:19.420\nA little bit of nuance in this question.\n\n90\n00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.600\nAll processes, all stages have some\nconcern with policy and directions.\n\n91\n00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.780\nSo perhaps the test maker got a little\nbit full of himself here, a little bit.\n\n92\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.830\nSo it makes for a good review,\nperhaps not a great test question.\n\n93\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.400\nBut it does define governance, right?\n\n94\n00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.210\nOf course, every process at every\nlifecycle stage has this concern.\n\n95\n00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.876\nGovernance is the one that has\nthe overarching concern with policy and\n\n96\n00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:42.381\ndirection.\n\n97\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.464\nWhich is an example of an operational\nlevel agreement, an OLA?\n\n98\n00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:03.650\nIn this case the answer is A.\n\n99\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.900\nA document that outlines agreements\nbetween service providers in the same\n\n100\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.090\norganization.\n\n101\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.690\nAgain, a quick reminder here.\n\n102\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.620\nIf you're the email service provider,\nyou have an agreement with the customers,\n\n103\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.480\nthat would be a service level agreement.\n\n104\n00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.830\nBut for\nyou to deliver your services as email,\n\n105\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.820\nyou need to have some other services\nunderneath you to help you.\n\n106\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.300\nYou need server services perhaps,\nidentity management services, so\n\n107\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.200\nyou would have OLAs with them.\n\n108\n00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.110\nOperational Level Agreements with\nthose underpinning services so\n\n109\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.660\nthat you can deliver your\nservice at the right levels.\n\n110\n00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.973\nSo an OLA, as it says here,\n\n111\n00:06:34.973 --> 00:06:38.588\nis an agreement between service\nproviders within the same organization.\n\n112\n00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:47.033\nA known error record has been created\nafter completing diagnosis of a problem,\n\n113\n00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:49.410\nbut before finding a workaround.\n\n114\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.353\nSo you know you got something going on.\n\n115\n00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:55.820\nYou're just not really sure how to get\naround it or even solve it, right?\n\n116\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.076\nIs this a valid approach to create that\nknown error record before you know really\n\n117\n00:06:59.076 --> 00:06:59.860\nwhat's going on?\n\n118\n00:07:05.662 --> 00:07:10.406\nYou might be tempted to evaluate the no's\nhere since there's so many of them, but\n\n119\n00:07:10.406 --> 00:07:12.205\nthe answer is yes.\n\n120\n00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:15.225\nThe key to this is a known error\n\n121\n00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:18.405\nrecord is really trying to\nstreamline incident management.\n\n122\n00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:20.351\nSo, just imagine a service call coming in.\n\n123\n00:07:20.351 --> 00:07:24.530\nThe service desk technician is saying,\nhmm, I need to look into this.\n\n124\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.360\nIf you have a known error record,\nyou don't have to look as deep\n\n125\n00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.100\nbecause the known error records say,\nyeah, we know this is going on.\n\n126\n00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.780\nWe're not sure what we're\ndoing about it yet.\n\n127\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.187\nBut you don't waste time or the customer's\ntime researching something you know that's\n\n128\n00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:37.783\nalready under consideration.\n\n129\n00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:44.885\nWhich is used to communicate a high\nlevel description of a major\n\n130\n00:07:44.885 --> 00:07:49.016\nchange that involves significant cost and\nrisk to the organization?\n\n131\n00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:58.974\nThis is almost the rote definition\nof a change proposal, answer A.\n\n132\n00:07:58.974 --> 00:08:00.482\nIt's for the big things.\n\n133\n00:08:00.482 --> 00:08:04.765\nNot every change needs\nthis level of rigor.\n\n134\n00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:06.507\nA change proposal.\n\n135\n00:08:06.507 --> 00:08:10.435\nThe more standard kinda changes or\nthe more routine changes are RFCs,\n\n136\n00:08:10.435 --> 00:08:12.030\nrequests for change.\n\n137\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.010\nBut a change proposal is for\nthe big things, all right?\n\n138\n00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.287\nOften generated by a service strategy.\n\n139\n00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:19.243\nGoing all the way back up to\nthe top of the life cycle stage.\n\n140\n00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:24.514\n13, which person or\ngroup is responsible for\n\n141\n00:08:24.514 --> 00:08:27.760\nagreeing service targets\nwith the service provider?\n\n142\n00:08:35.622 --> 00:08:38.110\nThis was also kind of a little\nbit of a flakey question.\n\n143\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.170\nWe're talking about\nthe customer in this case.\n\n144\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:43.370\nThe service provider has\nagreements with the customer.\n\n145\n00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.883\nI can make an argument that you could,\nas a service provider,\n\n146\n00:08:46.883 --> 00:08:49.529\nbe making agreements\nwith suppliers as well.\n\n147\n00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.522\nSo find this a little bit flaky.\n\n148\n00:08:51.522 --> 00:08:55.010\nWhat we're getting at here, what they're\ntrying to get at here with the question.\n\n149\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.513\nAnd let's take this learning away.\n\n150\n00:08:56.513 --> 00:08:59.473\nIs that there is an agreement between\ncustomers and the service providers.\n\n151\n00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:01.715\nAnd that agreement's called\na service level agreement.\n\n152\n00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:08.390\nWhich of the following\nis true regarding value?\n\n153\n00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:19.190\nFrom our treatment of\nthis topic in our show,\n\n154\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.720\nyou should have gotten this one right.\n\n155\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.170\nIt's a, Value is defined by the customer.\n\n156\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.278\nThe phrase, the customer is always\nright may not be completely correct.\n\n157\n00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:34.662\nBut the only opinion that matters when it\ncomes to value is the customer's opinion.\n\n158\n00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:40.560\nSoftware and technology are examples\nof which of the four Ps?\n\n159\n00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:51.710\nSoftware and\ntechnology are rolled into the products.\n\n160\n00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.047\nAcronym there for the P there.\n\n161\n00:09:53.047 --> 00:09:59.019\nYou'll remember the other ones are people,\npartners, processes, and products.\n\n162\n00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:04.546\nWhich is the main reason for\n\n163\n00:10:04.546 --> 00:10:09.181\na service provider to understand\nthe five aspects of service design?\n\n164\n00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:12.783\nThis is the stamp mnemonic\nthat we talked about.\n\n165\n00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:20.856\nAnd again,\nit's just reinforcing this idea.\n\n166\n00:10:20.856 --> 00:10:22.188\nB's the correct answer.\n\n167\n00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:26.645\nIt's just reinforcing this idea that\nsolution design is not the same as service\n\n168\n00:10:26.645 --> 00:10:27.685\ndesign.\n\n169\n00:10:27.685 --> 00:10:29.976\nAnd service design must\nhave an holistic approach\n\n170\n00:10:33.672 --> 00:10:37.730\nWhich is the correct set of steps in the\nContinual Service Improvement approach?\n\n171\n00:10:39.745 --> 00:10:41.700\nThis is just rote memorization as well.\n\n172\n00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:53.913\nThe answer is d.\n\n173\n00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:57.516\nI think you might have gotten\nthis answer fairly quickly.\n\n174\n00:10:57.516 --> 00:10:58.764\nIt's certainly reinforced during the show.\n\n175\n00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:04.280\nThat you always start with, why do we\neven care about this, what is the vision?\n\n176\n00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.273\nSo hopefully you started evaluating d\npretty early as you went here, right.\n\n177\n00:11:08.273 --> 00:11:13.540\nAnd you need to start with that before\nyou start baselining where you are.\n\n178\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.620\nAnd where you wanna be is,\nwhy do we even care?\n\n179\n00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.730\nSo it starts with what is division?\n\n180\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.830\nWhich three types of metrics support\ncontinual service improvement?\n\n181\n00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:30.300\nI'll give you a hint.\n\n182\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.900\nIf you get this one wrong, you get a red\nstapler and an office in the basement.\n\n183\n00:11:36.872 --> 00:11:39.630\nIt's c, technology, process, and service.\n\n184\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.950\nI made the joke about the TPS\nreports alluding to that movie.\n\n185\n00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.720\nMaybe you haven't seen it,\nit's called Office Space.\n\n186\n00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.720\nSo for those who haven't seen it,\nthat was a lost reference.\n\n187\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.010\nBut if you haven't seen it,\nthere's a hole in your life.\n\n188\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.450\nYou must watch that movie, yeah.\n\n189\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.840\nAnyway, the answer is technology,\nprocess, and service.\n\n190\n00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.204\nYour TPS metrics.\n\n191\n00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:01.144\nWhich part of Financial Management for\nIT service.\n\n192\n00:12:01.144 --> 00:12:03.599\nDeals with predicting and\ncontrolling income and\n\n193\n00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:05.643\nexpenditure within the organization?\n\n194\n00:12:05.643 --> 00:12:09.728\nWe talked about the ABCs\nof financial management,\n\n195\n00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:13.850\naccounting, budgeting, and charging.\n\n196\n00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.230\nThis is focused on budgeting,\nthat process or\n\n197\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.790\nthat activity that is\npredictive in nature.\n\n198\n00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.015\nWhat do we expect to spend?\n\n199\n00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:25.130\nAnd of course accounting is the actuals,\nwhat did we actually spend?\n\n200\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.370\nSo budgeting is the correct answer for\nthat predictive part.\n\n201\n00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:31.467\nWhat is the PRIMARY process for\n\n202\n00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:37.040\nstrategic communication with\nthe service provider's customers?\n\n203\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.691\nWhich is the PRIMARY process for\n\n204\n00:12:39.691 --> 00:12:45.396\nstrategic communication with\nthe service provider's customers?\n\n205\n00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:46.897\nThat's business relationship management.\n\n206\n00:12:50.513 --> 00:12:52.794\nOkay.\n\n207\n00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:57.561\nWhich of these recommendations are best\npractice for service level agreements?\n\n208\n00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.846\nAgain, a multiple choice\ninside a multiple choice.\n\n209\n00:13:05.846 --> 00:13:08.330\nEvaluate each of the ones and four.\n\n210\n00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:08.910\nI'll do that.\n\n211\n00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.309\nInclude legal terminology in\nservice level agreements.\n\n212\n00:13:11.309 --> 00:13:16.065\nBecause a service level agreement\nis between a service provider and\n\n213\n00:13:16.065 --> 00:13:18.913\nthe customer, typically internally.\n\n214\n00:13:18.913 --> 00:13:22.680\nAn SLA is going to be not legal.\n\n215\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.310\nRight?\n\n216\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.170\nIf you consider\n\n217\n00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.408\nan agreement with an external customer\nyou're gonna have a contract, not an SLA.\n\n218\n00:13:26.408 --> 00:13:30.595\nYou'll have the service level\ntargets within that contract.\n\n219\n00:13:30.595 --> 00:13:32.056\nAll right?\n\n220\n00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:33.700\nSo one is out.\n\n221\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.690\nEnsure all targets in\nthe SLA are measurable.\n\n222\n00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.728\nAbsolutely correct here.\n\n223\n00:13:37.728 --> 00:13:39.154\nService level agreements should\nhave measurable targets.\n\n224\n00:13:39.154 --> 00:13:42.869\nThey're very objective in their nature,\nso 2 is in.\n\n225\n00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:46.073\nEnsure the SLA is signed by\nboth customer and provider.\n\n226\n00:13:46.073 --> 00:13:49.824\nYes, you formalize this\nagreement through signatures.\n\n227\n00:13:49.824 --> 00:13:51.448\nSo 2 and 3 are in.\n\n228\n00:13:51.448 --> 00:13:55.120\nInclude the service hours and\ncost of delivering service.\n\n229\n00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.920\nNot necessary within the agreement at all.\n\n230\n00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.657\nSo, you're looking for the answer\nthat has 2 and 3, b is that answer.\n\n231\n00:14:04.824 --> 00:14:09.310\nWhich is the best description of\na service-based service level agreement?\n\n232\n00:14:11.849 --> 00:14:14.770\nWe're talking about structures of\nservice level agreements here.\n\n233\n00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:24.875\nA service based service-level agreement is\nan agreement that covers one service for\n\n234\n00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:27.120\nall customers of that service.\n\n235\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.630\nYou recall that we also talked\nabout customer-based agreements.\n\n236\n00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.665\nThat would have the customer's\nname at the top and\n\n237\n00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:35.273\nall of the services they subscribe to.\n\n238\n00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:37.102\nWe also talk about corporate based.\n\n239\n00:14:37.102 --> 00:14:41.560\nAnd of course you can have some hybrid or\nmulti-based agreements as well.\n\n240\n00:14:44.355 --> 00:14:47.840\nWhich is not a responsibility\nof service catalogue management?\n\n241\n00:14:54.341 --> 00:14:55.600\nSo looking for the not.\n\n242\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.450\nDoes service catalog management ensure\nthat information about the IT services\n\n243\n00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.470\nis accurate?\n\n244\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.710\nYes.\n\n245\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.660\nEnsure that service level\nagreements are maintained?\n\n246\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.471\nHm, I believe that's the responsibility\nof service level management, so\n\n247\n00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:10.428\nb is suspect here.\n\n248\n00:15:10.428 --> 00:15:11.240\nAnd let's go ahead and\n\n249\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.510\nremind ourselves what service catalogue\nmanagement is responsible for.\n\n250\n00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.000\nEnsuring that information in\nthe service catalogue is consistent\n\n251\n00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.450\nwith the service portfolio, absolutely.\n\n252\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.570\nAnd ensuring that all operational services\nare recorded in the service catalogue.\n\n253\n00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.350\nThat's correct, service catalogue\nis the portion of the portfolio\n\n254\n00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.340\nthat has the current\noperational services in it.\n\n255\n00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.138\nSo a, c, and\nd are actually responsibilities.\n\n256\n00:15:33.138 --> 00:15:35.740\nB is the outlier here and\nthat's what you're looking for.\n\n257\n00:15:38.346 --> 00:15:41.660\nWhich is not an objective\nof supplier management?\n\n258\n00:15:43.355 --> 00:15:45.940\nAnd again, looking for another not.\n\n259\n00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.480\nSo does supplier management\nmaintain the supplier policy?\n\n260\n00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.340\nYes.\n\n261\n00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.667\nDoes supplier management categorize\nsuppliers and do risk assessments?\n\n262\n00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:57.415\nYes.\n\n263\n00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:00.883\nMaintain the service\nknowledge management system?\n\n264\n00:16:00.883 --> 00:16:02.216\nWell, no.\n\n265\n00:16:02.216 --> 00:16:03.048\nNot c.\n\n266\n00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.902\nRight, and then finally,\nidentifying opportunities for\n\n267\n00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:10.420\nthe continual service\nimprovement register.\n\n268\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.900\nYes, and just a sideline comment there,\nany process, or\n\n269\n00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.330\nany person, is responsible,\nor accountable, or\n\n270\n00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.170\na practitioner, if you will, for\nidentifying opportunities for the CSI.\n\n271\n00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.520\nThat's not a purview of any one process,\n\n272\n00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.450\nthat's the purview of everyone,\nidentifying opportunities for improvement.\n\n273\n00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:37.000\nWhich process has the objective: To ensure\nall service models conform to strategic,\n\n274\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.320\narchitectural, governance, and\nother corporate requirements?\n\n275\n00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:41.820\nWhich process?\n\n276\n00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:51.280\nIt's gonna be design coordination.\n\n277\n00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.120\nEspecially as you get, just talking\nabout basically service design is\n\n278\n00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.440\ntrying to realize the goals\nof service strategy.\n\n279\n00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.460\nDesign coordination, I refer to it\nas the mother hen of the process or\n\n280\n00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.300\nthe stage of service design.\n\n281\n00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.183\nAnd as such is making sure all of\nthis happens, design coordination.\n\n282\n00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.621\nWhich statement about the emergency\nchange advisory board, ECAB, is correct?\n\n283\n00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:27.145\nThe answer is C.\n\n284\n00:17:27.145 --> 00:17:28.424\nECAB will be used for\n\n285\n00:17:28.424 --> 00:17:32.648\nemergency changes where there might\nnot be time to call a full CAB.\n\n286\n00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:41.399\nWho normally chairs\nthe Change Advisory Board or the CAB?\n\n287\n00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:47.510\nAgain, just rote memorization here.\n\n288\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.030\nThis would be the change manager.\n\n289\n00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:53.940\nThe service owner is likely a stakeholder\nand will show up at the CAB, but service\n\n290\n00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.720\nowners generally are more accountable\nthan they are responsible for things.\n\n291\n00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.420\nAnd the change manager will be responsible\nfor shepherding these changes through\n\n292\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.040\nthe CAB, the service owner will\nshow up and weigh in, all right?\n\n293\n00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.810\nThe change initiator also would be there,\nall right?\n\n294\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.820\nWhat is the second phase in release and\ndeployment management?\n\n295\n00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.569\nAgain, just another rote memorization,\nthere's four phases.\n\n296\n00:18:13.569 --> 00:18:15.217\nThe second one is.\n\n297\n00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:21.190\nC, release build and test.\n\n298\n00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.665\nJust a word of caution here,\n\n299\n00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:25.676\nin this particular example\nthe word release is not a verb,\n\n300\n00:18:25.676 --> 00:18:30.600\nit's an adjective, they're talking about\nthe building and testing of releases.\n\n301\n00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.532\nSo, the second phase is the building and\ntesting.\n\n302\n00:18:34.532 --> 00:18:40.060\nThe third phase is deploy, and\nthe last one's review and close, right.\n\n303\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.172\nRelease and deployment planning\nis the first one, okay.\n\n304\n00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:50.361\nWhich process has the objective: to\nimprove the quality of management decision\n\n305\n00:18:50.361 --> 00:18:52.776\nmaking, by ensuring that reliable and\n\n306\n00:18:52.776 --> 00:18:56.598\nsecure information is available\nthroughout the life cycle?\n\n307\n00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:05.258\nWe're talking about knowledge management\nto create that ocean of information and\n\n308\n00:19:05.258 --> 00:19:07.006\nmake it available for everybody.\n\n309\n00:19:07.006 --> 00:19:07.983\nThat's right.\n\n310\n00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:15.580\nWhich process helps to ensure that new or\nchanged services are established and\n\n311\n00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.709\nsupported environments within\nthe predicted cost, quality and\n\n312\n00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:20.848\ntime estimates?\n\n313\n00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:31.060\nThis is the process called\ntransition planning and support.\n\n314\n00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.630\nWhere design coordination is the mother\nhen of service design, this process,\n\n315\n00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:36.550\ntransition planning and\n\n316\n00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.860\nsupport, is the mother hen of\nthe stage called service transition.\n\n317\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.489\nAnd together they work effectively with\nproject management disciplines to make\n\n318\n00:19:44.489 --> 00:19:46.798\nsure everything is provided on time and\non budget.\n\n319\n00:19:51.392 --> 00:19:53.933\nWhat should be done when\nclosing an incident?\n\n320\n00:19:53.933 --> 00:19:56.608\nAgain, another multiple choice\ninside a multiple choice.\n\n321\n00:19:56.608 --> 00:19:58.462\nSo let's just consider these.\n\n322\n00:19:58.462 --> 00:20:01.730\nWhat should be done when\nclosing an incident?\n\n323\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.090\nCheck the incident categorization and\ncorrect it if necessary.\n\n324\n00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.500\nThat sounds reasonable.\n\n325\n00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.060\nCheck that the user is\nsatisfied with the outcome.\n\n326\n00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.740\nThat also sounds reasonable.\n\n327\n00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.930\nRecord a known error record\nwith the resolution.\n\n328\n00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.040\nThat's not what a known\nerror record is about.\n\n329\n00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.613\nA known error record\ncould be illustrated or\n\n330\n00:20:20.613 --> 00:20:23.620\nproduced even before there is resolution.\n\n331\n00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.620\nPerform an incident review for\nlessons learned.\n\n332\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.230\nThat type of deliberative response to\nincidents is done by problem management.\n\n333\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:36.060\nSo the deliberative process as problem\nmanagement, instant management, down and\n\n334\n00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.570\ndirty, pretty quick, this restores\nservices quickly as possible.\n\n335\n00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.077\nSo one and two are the correct\nresponses here, that is in a.\n\n336\n00:20:47.581 --> 00:20:50.732\nWhich best describes\nhierarchic escalation?\n\n337\n00:21:03.004 --> 00:21:07.225\nThis term, hierarchic escalation, is\nused within incident management process.\n\n338\n00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:12.085\nAnd it is a part of notifying more senior\nlevels of management about an incident.\n\n339\n00:21:12.085 --> 00:21:14.428\nThe other one, you might recall,\nis called functional escalation.\n\n340\n00:21:19.191 --> 00:21:24.800\nA significant unresolved problem is likely\nto cause major business disruption.\n\n341\n00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.667\nWhere is the most likely\nto be escalated to?\n\n342\n00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:30.840\nWhere is this most likely\nto be escalated to?\n\n343\n00:21:39.056 --> 00:21:41.950\nThis question has got some\nlevels of depth here.\n\n344\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.325\nFirst of all,\nyou have an unresolved problem,\n\n345\n00:21:44.325 --> 00:21:47.130\nmeaning you've already\nidentified it as a problem.\n\n346\n00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.900\nITIL and their test makers use\nwords very deliberatively.\n\n347\n00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.640\nAnd problem is this very specific word,\nright?\n\n348\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.910\nIt means you already understand\nyou have a problem and\n\n349\n00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.280\nit's likely to cause major\nbusiness disruption.\n\n350\n00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.304\nSo when you talk about escalation you've\nalready got an escalator's problem.\n\n351\n00:22:03.304 --> 00:22:07.369\nSo if you want to make sure you want to\nforestall major business disruptions,\n\n352\n00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:10.759\nyou wanna consider escalating\nthis to continuity management.\n\n353\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.760\nIt's a lot of depth into this question.\n\n354\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.390\nAs continuity supports availability,\nI could see some distractures there with\n\n355\n00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.530\navailability certainly don't\nescalate instant management.\n\n356\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.409\nAnd if you don't know\nwhat the root cause is,\n\n357\n00:22:28.409 --> 00:22:30.150\nit's not gonna be easy to get it changed.\n\n358\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.639\nSo you're not gonna escalate\nit to change management.\n\n359\n00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.750\nService continuity management's\nthe best answer here.\n\n360\n00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.510\nWhich process will regularly\nanalyze incidents data to identify\n\n361\n00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.310\ndiscernible trends?\n\n362\n00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:45.880\nThis indeed is problem management.\n\n363\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:51.210\nThis is the deliberative process\nthat reviews current incidents,\n\n364\n00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.290\nand tries to keep them from coming back.\n\n365\n00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.464\nAnd also, you'll recall that\nproblem management has a proactive,\n\n366\n00:22:56.464 --> 00:22:59.309\nnot just reacting to incidents\nas they come, but proactive,\n\n367\n00:22:59.309 --> 00:23:02.120\nin that they try to forestall\nincidents from even starting.\n\n368\n00:23:05.267 --> 00:23:08.015\nWhich is the best definition\nof a service request?\n\n369\n00:23:19.245 --> 00:23:21.169\nThis is a request for\nuser for information,\n\n370\n00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:22.573\nadvice or for standard change.\n\n371\n00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:32.295\nWhich service desk organization structure\nis not described in service operation?\n\n372\n00:23:41.166 --> 00:23:44.870\nSo these other three are local\nservice desk, virtual service desk and\n\n373\n00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.380\nfollow the sun.\n\n374\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.200\nThe missing one is centralized service\ndesk as a structure of service desks.\n\n375\n00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.066\nThis idea of an IT help desk,\nI think's an interesting red herring.\n\n376\n00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:58.591\nIf you hadn't taken the course you might\nbe tempted to choose something you're\n\n377\n00:23:58.591 --> 00:24:01.020\njust not familiar with,\nlike follow the sun perhaps.\n\n378\n00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.945\nBut help desk is not\na term that ITIL uses.\n\n379\n00:24:03.945 --> 00:24:06.089\nThey use the term service desk.\n\n380\n00:24:06.089 --> 00:24:09.728\nSo that's a good thing to\nstuff in your memory bank,\n\n381\n00:24:09.728 --> 00:24:13.214\nis help desk is just not\nin the vocabulary of ITIL.\n\n382\n00:24:16.952 --> 00:24:18.112\nWhich function or\n\n383\n00:24:18.112 --> 00:24:22.838\nprocess would provide staff to monitor\nevents in an operations bridge?\n\n384\n00:24:27.483 --> 00:24:29.887\nSo, first of all, we're looking for\na function or a process.\n\n385\n00:24:34.113 --> 00:24:38.590\nPerhaps what's gonna help with\nthis one is operations bridge.\n\n386\n00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.780\nMaybe that's unusual terminology,\nnot that familiar.\n\n387\n00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.360\nAn operations bridge is kind of\nlike Captain Kirk, his bridge or\n\n388\n00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.940\nthe bridge of a ship, right?\n\n389\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.010\nIt's where you can go,\n\n390\n00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.210\nyou can control things you have\ncommunications at your ready.\n\n391\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.470\nYou have staff involved,\nmonitoring the health of the ship.\n\n392\n00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.330\nSo in IT, an operations bridge is that\nlocation within the IT organization\n\n393\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.800\nwhere you have central control and\ncommunications mechanisms in place.\n\n394\n00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.800\nSometimes I've heard them\ncalled command centers,\n\n395\n00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.030\nnetwork operating centers,\ncentral operating centers, right?\n\n396\n00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.292\nSo, this term, operations bridge,\nis just that concept.\n\n397\n00:25:16.292 --> 00:25:20.669\nAnd the function, IT operations\nmanagement, the day to day grind of IT.\n\n398\n00:25:23.442 --> 00:25:27.970\nWhat is a process owner\nnot responsible for?\n\n399\n00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.670\nSo again, looking for the nots.\n\n400\n00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.286\nThese make for\n\n401\n00:25:30.286 --> 00:25:33.477\ngreat review questions cuz you reinforce\nwhat they are responsible for.\n\n402\n00:25:33.477 --> 00:25:36.251\nSo are they responsible for\ndefining a process strategy?\n\n403\n00:25:38.817 --> 00:25:40.629\nYes, so that's not the correct answer.\n\n404\n00:25:40.629 --> 00:25:45.120\nCommunication or process information or\nchanges to ensure awareness?\n\n405\n00:25:47.908 --> 00:25:49.974\nDeveloping IT plans that meet and\n\n406\n00:25:49.974 --> 00:25:53.950\ncontinue to meet the IT\nrequirements of the business?\n\n407\n00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.588\nThat's well beyond the process\nowner's remit, number c is, right?\n\n408\n00:26:02.498 --> 00:26:08.652\nWhat is the role of a person if they\nare categorized as I in a RACI matrix?\n\n409\n00:26:16.175 --> 00:26:17.395\nThey must be kept up to date.\n\n410\n00:26:17.395 --> 00:26:19.937\nInformed is what the I stands for.\n\n411\n00:26:19.937 --> 00:26:25.070\nAnd then last, which of these can be\nintroduced to provide improved detection\n\n412\n00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:30.297\nand monitoring, pattern recognition\nanalysis, and service optimization?\n\n413\n00:26:36.614 --> 00:26:39.730\nJust looking for\nthe value of service automation.\n\n414\n00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.920\nJust about everything could be automated.\n\n415\n00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.870\nAs you're trying to discern in any\ngiven exam what can be automated and\n\n416\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.350\nwhat can't be automated, you're gonna be\nfairly inclusive of what can be automated.\n\n417\n00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.222\nThe things that can't be automated\nare things like wisdom or\n\n418\n00:26:53.222 --> 00:26:56.130\nauthority, really human things.\n\n419\n00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.180\nBut pretty much everything\nelse can be automated.\n\n420\n00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.670\nWell, that concludes our\nreview of Sample Paper C.\n\n421\n00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:07.520\nAgain, these practices, I encourage\nyou to go back to those, look at them,\n\n422\n00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.360\nmaybe use them kind of like a flash card,\nreinforcement of some of the concepts, or\n\n423\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.700\nall of the concepts here.\n\n424\n00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:17.327\nAnd remember, there's also a Sample Paper\nD, we address that in another episode, and\n\n425\n00:27:17.327 --> 00:27:19.470\nhit the discussion forums.\n\n426\n00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.887\nBut for now, that concludes our\nreview of Sample Paper C, good luck.\n\n427\n00:27:23.887 --> 00:27:27.620\n[SOUND]\n\n",

and\n\n4\n00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:09.486\nwe're gonna be helping out with\na little bit of Exam Prep today.\n\n5\n00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:12.830\nWe're specifically focusing\non sample paper D.\n\n6\n00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.765\nTerry, help us out and lead us through\nwhat we're gonna be taking a look at.\n\n7\n00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:19.843\n&gt;&gt; Well, as you know,\nthere's two downloadable sample papers or\n\n8\n00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:20.700\npractice exams.\n\n9\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.300\nSample paper C and sample paper D.\n\n10\n00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.720\nIn another episode,\nwe cover sample paper C.\n\n11\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.390\nNow we're gonna do sample paper D.\n\n12\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.540\nThese are really good practice exams.\n\n13\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.750\nThey really do give you an idea of\nwhat's in the test maker's mind.\n\n14\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.850\nGives you kind of a leg up for\nwhen you go and take your real exam.\n\n15\n00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.490\nSo I'm just gonna go through 1 through 40,\neach question at a time.\n\n16\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.880\nAnd look at the correct answers and\nin some cases,\n\n17\n00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.630\ngive critics over why the incorrect\nanswers are incorrect.\n\n18\n00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.530\nSo, let's just dig in.\n\n19\n00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.160\nWe'll look here at the first question.\n\n20\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.420\nWhich of the following examples\nis a source of best practice?\n\n21\n00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:01.390\nYou remember sources of best practice\nare where the ideas come from.\n\n22\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.470\nAcademic research,\n\n23\n00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.040\ninternal experience, standards\ncan also be one of those sources.\n\n24\n00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.080\nThese others, a, b and d,\nare actually enablers of best practice.\n\n25\n00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.252\nThis is where the people are.\n\n26\n00:01:13.252 --> 00:01:16.955\nPeople take those good ideas and\nenable best practice.\n\n27\n00:01:20.543 --> 00:01:26.406\nWhich is the correct explanation of\nhow a service facilitates an outcome?\n\n28\n00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:40.105\nThis is an example of one\nof those nuanced questions.\n\n29\n00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:41.731\nThe correct answer is a.\n\n30\n00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:46.443\nIf you look at a, you'll see that\nit has enhancing performance or\n\n31\n00:01:46.443 --> 00:01:51.635\nretreating constraints,\nreducing the effects of constraints.\n\n32\n00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:55.360\nSo those two are related to utility.\n\n33\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.180\nUtility must be delivered to\nbe able to deliver value.\n\n34\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.480\nRemember what the other one was?\n\n35\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.490\nIt was warranty, right?\n\n36\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.350\nThis is the definition of utility.\n\n37\n00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.992\nWarranty actually probably comes\nup a little bit later on the other\n\n38\n00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:07.753\nsample question.\n\n39\n00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:14.654\nWhat ITIL term is used for\ncustomers of IT services,\n\n40\n00:02:14.654 --> 00:02:18.701\nwho do not work in the same\norganization as the service provider?\n\n41\n00:02:20.582 --> 00:02:23.473\nPretty straightforward here,\nexternal customer.\n\n42\n00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:30.346\nWhat should be defined for every process?\n\n43\n00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.530\nThe best answer here is a.\n\n44\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.722\nEvery process should have an owner,\na policy that backs up that\n\n45\n00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:50.409\nprocess that bolsters it and,\nof course, the activities themselves.\n\n46\n00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:58.960\nAll the stages of the ITIL lifecycle have\na role to play in ensuring the delivery of\n\n47\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.540\nhigh quality IT services at optimum cost.\n\n48\n00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.732\nWhich of these has the best opportunity\nto prevent difficulties as early\n\n49\n00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:11.513\nas possible and\nminimize the cost of any remedial work?\n\n50\n00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:22.006\nThis question is effectively\ntesting the lifecycle stages and\n\n51\n00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:23.670\nthe order they fall in.\n\n52\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.260\nService strategy would be\nthe absolute earliest.\n\n53\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.420\nService design next, service transition,\nservice operation, and of course CSI.\n\n54\n00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.758\nSo service design is the earliest\namong these choices.\n\n55\n00:03:38.892 --> 00:03:43.989\nWhich is not part of the service\ntransition stage of the service lifecycle?\n\n56\n00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:53.600\nHopefully, this one's obvious.\n\n57\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.840\nIt's designing and developing capabilities\nfor service management, right?\n\n58\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.199\nThe other three are certainly\npart of service transition.\n\n59\n00:04:05.168 --> 00:04:07.699\nWhich is an objective\nof service operation?\n\n60\n00:04:14.781 --> 00:04:18.170\nPretty much textbook definition here in a.\n\n61\n00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.110\nTo coordinate and carry out\nthe activities and processes required to\n\n62\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.430\ndeliver services to the business and\nmanage them at agreed levels.\n\n63\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.341\nThis is where the value actually\ngets delivered to the customer.\n\n64\n00:04:31.056 --> 00:04:34.225\nWhich is the BEST description\nof a business case?\n\n65\n00:04:42.538 --> 00:04:44.960\nIt is a tool that helps\nyou make decisions.\n\n66\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.200\nIt's a decision support and\n\n67\n00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.070\nplanning tool that details the likely\nconsequence of business action.\n\n68\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.800\nIt's also for\na significant item of expense.\n\n69\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.098\nIt's gonna be something you bring\na business case in a formal process for\n\n70\n00:04:57.098 --> 00:04:58.406\nsignificant investments.\n\n71\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.734\nWhich of these statements\nabout service asset and\n\n72\n00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:06.630\nconfiguration management is CORRECT?\n\n73\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.060\nAgain, a multiple choice\ninside a multiple choice.\n\n74\n00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.780\nSo let's just look at each one of them.\n\n75\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.300\nA configuration item can be a component\npart of one or more other CIs.\n\n76\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.870\nThat's a correct statement.\n\n77\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.240\nSo 1 is in.\n\n78\n00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.900\nHow an organization groups components\ninto configuration items will depend\n\n79\n00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.070\non the level of control\nthey wish to exert.\n\n80\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.050\nThat's also a correct statement.\n\n81\n00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.550\nA single configuration management database\nis the objective for an organization.\n\n82\n00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.440\nNot at all.\n\n83\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.050\nYou might have multiple CMDBs.\n\n84\n00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.677\nAnd this says all CMDB audits\nshould be conducted by\n\n85\n00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:47.110\nexternal auditors using a CMDB standard.\n\n86\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.660\nAlso not correct at all.\n\n87\n00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.955\nSo the answer is a,\nthe ones that include one and two.\n\n88\n00:05:55.637 --> 00:05:58.574\nWhich best defines availability?\n\n89\n00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:08.643\nThe answer here is D.\n\n90\n00:06:08.643 --> 00:06:10.940\nThe ability of a service component or\n\n91\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.070\na CI to perform its agreed\nfunction when required.\n\n92\n00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.193\nIs it even available for use?\n\n93\n00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:19.108\nPretty straight forward there.\n\n94\n00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:23.664\nNumber 11, the definitive media\nlibrary is the responsibility\n\n95\n00:06:23.664 --> 00:06:29.629\nof The process\n\n96\n00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.656\nthat governs the definitive media library\nis service asset configuration management.\n\n97\n00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:38.046\n12, a cause of one or\n\n98\n00:06:38.046 --> 00:06:42.110\nmore incidents is the ITIL\ndefinition of which of these terms?\n\n99\n00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.790\nThis is rote memorization.\n\n100\n00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.850\nIt's probably easy to get lost in\nthe semantics, the answer is c.\n\n101\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.490\nThis is the definition of a problem,\na cause of one or\n\n102\n00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.010\nmore incidents is the ITIL definition,\nright?\n\n103\n00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.350\nWhere would all the possible service\nimprovement opportunities be recorded?\n\n104\n00:07:08.323 --> 00:07:10.960\nAlso just wrote memorization,\nthe CSI register, right, okay.\n\n105\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.842\nWhich is not a defined area of value?\n\n106\n00:07:22.277 --> 00:07:23.851\nThe answer is b, and this makes for\n\n107\n00:07:23.851 --> 00:07:27.760\na great review question because these\nother three are the areas of value.\n\n108\n00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.910\nCustomer preferences, customer\nperceptions and business outcomes.\n\n109\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.960\nYou may recall from the lecture\nthe example of the crank window\n\n110\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.920\nnot necessarily meeting\nthe expectations and\n\n111\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.730\npreferences of the customer while\nmeeting the business outcomes.\n\n112\n00:07:44.049 --> 00:07:45.359\nBusiness policies.\n\n113\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.859\nAn Internal IT department would be\nconsidered which one of the four Ps of\n\n114\n00:07:50.859 --> 00:07:51.891\nservice design?\n\n115\n00:07:55.644 --> 00:07:56.807\nIt's where the people are.\n\n116\n00:07:56.807 --> 00:08:01.407\nAs opposed to a partner, which would\nbe a supplier IT provider, right?\n\n117\n00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:02.010\nPeople.\n\n118\n00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:06.799\nWhich do technology metrics measure?\n\n119\n00:08:11.804 --> 00:08:18.750\nComponents, you may recall the TPS Report,\nTechnology Process and Service Metrics.\n\n120\n00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.040\nTechnology metrics\nare focused on components.\n\n121\n00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.410\nProcess metrics focused on processes,\n\n122\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.420\nservice metrics are end to end,\nwhich is located there in C.\n\n123\n00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.169\nTechnology metrics are components.\n\n124\n00:08:31.809 --> 00:08:37.220\nWhat is the next step in the continual\nservice improvement, CSI approach?\n\n125\n00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.820\nWhat is the vision, where are we now,\n\n126\n00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.720\nwhere do we wanna be,\nhow do we get there, did we get there?\n\n127\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.270\nThen, how do we keep the momentum going?\n\n128\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.020\nThis is based on the dimming\ncycle of plan, do, check, act.\n\n129\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.890\nAnd it, indeed, is a cycle.\n\n130\n00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.390\nSo, that's where you get\nthe cycle restarted,\n\n131\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.470\nis how do we keep the momentum going?\n\n132\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.729\nWhich do service metrics measure?\n\n133\n00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.200\nWe kinda critiqued this one\na little bit earlier on 16,\n\n134\n00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.946\nit's the end-to-end service.\n\n135\n00:09:12.395 --> 00:09:16.416\nIn which document would you expect\nto see an overview of actual service\n\n136\n00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:18.335\nachievements against targets?\n\n137\n00:09:21.085 --> 00:09:24.203\nWell, the service level\nagreement identifies the target,\n\n138\n00:09:24.203 --> 00:09:27.139\nit's the service level\nagreement monitoring chart that\n\n139\n00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:30.810\nshows you the actual achievements\nagainst those targets.\n\n140\n00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.500\nSo, the SLAM chart.\n\n141\n00:09:33.455 --> 00:09:38.385\nWhere should a customer's initial\nservice targets be recorded before\n\n142\n00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:41.353\nthe service level agreement is produced?\n\n143\n00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:47.670\nThis is a formal document called\nthe Service Level Requirements.\n\n144\n00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.080\nThat's the high level requirements.\n\n145\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.330\nAs you'll recall, I mentioned that is if\nthe customer say, will you offer a 24/7?\n\n146\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.180\nThat's the high level requirement,\nservice level requirements.\n\n147\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.620\nBut as you begin to create\na measurable target for\n\n148\n00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.570\nthat, you might create availability\nmatrix that say, well,\n\n149\n00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.680\nwe're gonna have maintenance at least\nonce a week, is Sunday at 3 AM, okay?\n\n150\n00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.890\nRight, so, the high level requirement\nof 24/7 is going to be reduced down,\n\n151\n00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.570\nperhaps, to specific\nmeasurable targets in the SLA.\n\n152\n00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.270\nThe remediation plan should be evaluated\nat what point in the change life\n\n153\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:28.190\ncycle before the change is approved?\n\n154\n00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.160\nEvery change should have, sometimes in the\nindustry, it's called the back out plan.\n\n155\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.240\nITIL calls it the remediation plan.\n\n156\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.601\nThat plan you define before\nyou realize you need it.\n\n157\n00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:44.390\nWhich of the following lists shows\nchange types defined in ITIL?\n\n158\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.040\nAgain, just rote memorization here.\n\n159\n00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.980\nThe answer is D,\nstandard emergency and normal.\n\n160\n00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.080\nWhich is the best reason for\ncategorizing incidents?\n\n161\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.328\nWhy categorize incidents?\n\n162\n00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:06.791\nIt's retread analysis.\n\n163\n00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:10.930\nAll right, so over time, if you look\nat your categories of incidents, and\n\n164\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.506\nover time, you can say wow,\n\n165\n00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:17.210\nwe had 500 incidents this month\njust on the network services team.\n\n166\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.077\nThen you have an opportunity for\nchasing down some improvements, right,\n\n167\n00:11:20.077 --> 00:11:20.766\ntrend analysis.\n\n168\n00:11:22.754 --> 00:11:25.305\nWhat should be documented\nin an incident model?\n\n169\n00:11:28.942 --> 00:11:33.111\nSo, let's just look at the one through\nfour and identify them individually,\n\n170\n00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:36.720\nchronological order of steps\nto resolve the incident.\n\n171\n00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.800\nThat's in.\n\n172\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.510\nDetails of the service level agreement.\n\n173\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.750\nNo, that's not in.\n\n174\n00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.670\nDetails of agreed service\ncontinuity requirements.\n\n175\n00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.930\nThat's not in.\n\n176\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.800\nEscalation procedures for\nwho should be contacted and when.\n\n177\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.490\nSo, one and four are good,\nthat happens in D.\n\n178\n00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.010\nAnd remember, this word model,\nthe predefined steps for\n\n179\n00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.950\nhow to implement\na particular type of thing.\n\n180\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.090\nAnd you can just replace the thing\nwith change model, problem model,\n\n181\n00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.570\nrequest model, incident model.\n\n182\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.790\nIt's a very powerful word in ITIL.\n\n183\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.780\nWhich process is responsible for\neliminating recurring incidents and\n\n184\n00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:20.130\nminimizing the impact of incidents\nthat cannot be prevented?\n\n185\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.620\nThat is problem management all day long.\n\n186\n00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.639\nAgain, kind of rote memorization.\n\n187\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.840\nWith which process is problem management\nlikely to share categorization and\n\n188\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.230\nimpact coding systems?\n\n189\n00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.506\nVery likely, it's gonna be\nintegrated with incident management.\n\n190\n00:12:39.506 --> 00:12:42.250\nAgain, we talked about that in the show,\nproblem management and\n\n191\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.230\nincident management are linked together.\n\n192\n00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.679\nAnd if you can link them in your dataset,\neven better, so it's a good go.\n\n193\n00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.614\nWhich process includes facilitating\ngood stewardship of service and\n\n194\n00:12:54.614 --> 00:12:57.017\ncustomer assets as an objective?\n\n195\n00:13:02.145 --> 00:13:03.980\nFinancial management for IT services.\n\n196\n00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.990\nSpending the right money for\n\n197\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.341\nthe right things, for\nthe right causes, right services.\n\n198\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.739\nWhich process is responsible for recording\nthe current details, status, interfaces,\n\n199\n00:13:16.739 --> 00:13:21.489\nand dependencies of all live services and\nservices that are about to be implemented?\n\n200\n00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.806\nThis is the portion of the portfolio\ncalled service catalog and\n\n201\n00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:31.430\nservice catalog management is\nresponsible for that part.\n\n202\n00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.950\nLive services.\n\n203\n00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.890\nThis idea of a service that's about to\nbe implemented simply means that service\n\n204\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.870\nstrategists have already determined\nthat it's going to be brought to life,\n\n205\n00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.460\nit's funded, so you might start\nputting it in the catalog, so\n\n206\n00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:48.155\nthat you can start filling in the details\nand advertising it to customers, etc.\n\n207\n00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.892\nWhich process includes business,\nservice and component subprocesses?\n\n208\n00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:01.930\nTalked about this in the show.\n\n209\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.710\nIt's capacity management.\n\n210\n00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.990\nCapacity management is not\njust about components.\n\n211\n00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.330\nYou're talking about\nthe capacity of the service.\n\n212\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.260\nGenerally, the people within that service,\n\n213\n00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.660\nusually all could be talking about\nthe capacity of the business.\n\n214\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.320\nCan the business take on this service?\n\n215\n00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.947\nSo, capacity management has\nthese three subprocesses.\n\n216\n00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:23.405\nWhich service design process\nwould ensure that utility and\n\n217\n00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:27.789\nwarranty requirements are properly\naddressed in all service designs?\n\n218\n00:14:33.937 --> 00:14:36.140\nThis is design coordination.\n\n219\n00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.500\nDesign coordination is the mother\nhen of the design stage.\n\n220\n00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.355\nAnd not only is it responsible for each\nindividual services that gets designed,\n\n221\n00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:47.560\nit's to make sure there's repeatable\nprocesses ongoing for all designs.\n\n222\n00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.359\nDesign coordination.\n\n223\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.890\nWhich process is responsible for ensuring\nthat appropriate testing takes place?\n\n224\n00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.190\nYou may recall that one of the phases of\nrelease and deployment is building test.\n\n225\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.506\nSo there it is, release and\ndeployment management.\n\n226\n00:15:11.013 --> 00:15:15.519\nWhich term describes the experiences,\nideas, insights, and\n\n227\n00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.277\nvalues of individuals?\n\n228\n00:15:20.427 --> 00:15:22.020\nITIL calls that knowledge.\n\n229\n00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.446\nAnd knowledge management is trying to\nmake sure that these things are shared,\n\n230\n00:15:26.446 --> 00:15:29.706\nthat these ideas, experiences,\ninsights and values are actually shared.\n\n231\n00:15:32.612 --> 00:15:35.488\nWhat is the purpose of\ntransition planning and support?\n\n232\n00:15:41.997 --> 00:15:46.170\nTransition planning and support is\nthe mother hen for service transition.\n\n233\n00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:50.427\nDesign coordination, the mother hen of\nservice design, transition, planning and\n\n234\n00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:53.010\nsupport, the mother hen\nof service transition.\n\n235\n00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.113\nMake sure everything in this stage is\ndone well, and on time, and on budget.\n\n236\n00:15:59.649 --> 00:16:02.382\nWhich would not involve event management.\n\n237\n00:16:12.492 --> 00:16:15.321\nWhen I review this in live classes,\nI get a little push back.\n\n238\n00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:18.208\nIt's kind of fun, it makes for\na fun discussion.\n\n239\n00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:22.110\nRemember, what underpins event\nmanagement is the detection\n\n240\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.240\nof changes that is automated.\n\n241\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.242\nSo, the detection of the temperature in\nthe data center, or the detection of disc\n\n242\n00:16:30.242 --> 00:16:35.730\nspace shortages, those kinds of things,\nthe detection of events is automated.\n\n243\n00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.280\nAnd among these three things,\n\n244\n00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.950\nthe one that seems like less automated\nis recording service desk staff absence.\n\n245\n00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.061\nAgain, spirited conversations in\nclassrooms, because they say, well,\n\n246\n00:16:45.061 --> 00:16:46.150\nwe could automate that.\n\n247\n00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.378\nWe can automate anything, we're IT, right?\n\n248\n00:16:48.378 --> 00:16:51.780\nBut this is just one of those\nexamples of picking the best answer.\n\n249\n00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.461\nIn this case, it's recording\nservice desk staff absences,\n\n250\n00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:56.375\nnot something that's gonna be automated.\n\n251\n00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:02.421\nWhich process is responsible for\ndealing with complaints,\n\n252\n00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:05.205\ncomments, and\ngeneral inquiries from users?\n\n253\n00:17:05.205 --> 00:17:06.039\nWhich process?\n\n254\n00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:14.460\nAs close as this gets, the best\nanswer here is request fulfillment.\n\n255\n00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.930\nThe service desk is likely gonna be\nthe function in front of this process, for\n\n256\n00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.120\nmany users.\n\n257\n00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.949\nAnd as the users call and say,\nI can't find this, I need that,\n\n258\n00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:24.988\nthose are considered requests.\n\n259\n00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:31.804\nWhich is the best description\nof a centralized service desk?\n\n260\n00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:44.710\nD's the correct answer.\n\n261\n00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.570\nThese other three kinda point to\nthe other structures of service desks.\n\n262\n00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.120\nThe desk is co-located within or\nphysically closer to the user community it\n\n263\n00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.000\nserves, that's called\na local service desk.\n\n264\n00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.261\nAnd the desk uses technology and other\nsupport tools to give the impression that\n\n265\n00:18:00.261 --> 00:18:04.963\nmultiple desk locations are in one place,\nthat's called a virtual service desk.\n\n266\n00:18:04.963 --> 00:18:08.569\nThis c,\nthe desk provides 24 hours global support.\n\n267\n00:18:08.569 --> 00:18:11.680\nThat could actually be applied\nto any of the structures.\n\n268\n00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.452\nBut particularly, it's kinda\na little bit of a red herring here,\n\n269\n00:18:14.452 --> 00:18:17.489\nthey're talking about a service desk\nstructure called Follow the Sun.\n\n270\n00:18:20.473 --> 00:18:24.610\nWhich is an objective of\napplication management?\n\n271\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.626\nWhich by the way, is a function.\n\n272\n00:18:31.914 --> 00:18:36.380\nApplication management is a function that\nreally understands the applications well.\n\n273\n00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.600\nSo they're gonna make sure that the\nfunctionality of an application's gonna\n\n274\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.140\nmeet the requirements of the business.\n\n275\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.184\nSo b is the correct answer.\n\n276\n00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:45.209\nAll right.\n\n277\n00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.610\nWhich statement about\na service owner is incorrect?\n\n278\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.340\nSo, let's review all of these and\nlook for the bad one.\n\n279\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.431\nCarries out the day-to-day monitoring and\noperation of the services they own.\n\n280\n00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:05.179\nThat's probably not something a service\nowner does since service owners tend not\n\n281\n00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:06.990\nto get their hands so dirty.\n\n282\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.520\nThey're a bit more accountable\nthan they are responsible.\n\n283\n00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.174\nLet's look at the other ones,\nthough, to make sure.\n\n284\n00:19:11.174 --> 00:19:15.010\nB, contribute to continual improvement\naffecting the service they own.\n\n285\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:19.430\nAbsolutely, service owners\nshould be responsible for that.\n\n286\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:23.510\nIs a stakeholder in all the IT processes\nwhich support the services they own?\n\n287\n00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:24.320\nAbsolutely.\n\n288\n00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.210\nAnd d, is accountable for specific\nservice within their organization?\n\n289\n00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.850\nThat's absolutely true as well.\n\n290\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.480\nSo b, c, and d are very solid, a is not.\n\n291\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.993\nAnd it's incorrect that a service owner\nwould get their hands this dirty.\n\n292\n00:19:40.035 --> 00:19:45.345\n39, which rule should be followed when\ndefining a RACI authority matrix?\n\n293\n00:19:46.918 --> 00:19:49.360\nWe talked about this during the show.\n\n294\n00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.900\nOnly one person is accountable.\n\n295\n00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.650\nAnd just a couple of other rules there.\n\n296\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.660\nBecause accountable people\ndon't actually do anything,\n\n297\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.920\nyou have to have at least one responsible,\nright, for any given activity.\n\n298\n00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.330\nSo that's kinda the other rule.\n\n299\n00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.757\nOnly one person is accountable, but\n\n300\n00:20:04.757 --> 00:20:08.369\nyou have to have at least one responsible,\nall right?\n\n301\n00:20:08.369 --> 00:20:15.250\nGood, and last but not least, which does\nnot benefit from service automation?\n\n302\n00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.346\nThe answer's right there in bold already,\nwisdom.\n\n303\n00:20:18.346 --> 00:20:22.280\nAll right, well that concludes\nour reviews of Sample Paper D.\n\n304\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.066\nRemember, there's another exam,\nSample Paper C, that's also under review.\n\n305\n00:20:25.066 --> 00:20:26.880\nThere's an episode for that.\n\n306\n00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.950\nI encourage you strongly to review these,\nalso hit the discussion forum,\n\n307\n00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.120\nask any questions.\n\n308\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.440\nHappy to see you there.\n\n309\n00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.918\nAnd good luck with your exam.\n\n310\n00:20:35.918 --> 00:20:39.430\n[SOUND]\n\n",
