          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.365\n[NOISE] In this segment, we'll be\n\n2\n00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:09.325\ntaking a look at what we can expect from\n\n3\n00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:14.446\nour upcoming ITIL Foundation series.\n\n4\n00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:17.785\nNow, Terry, you've joined us, so\ngraciously, and we thank you for that.\n\n5\n00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:21.195\nWhy don't we go ahead and start with\nwho is the intended audience for\n\n6\n00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:22.455\nthis upcoming series?\n\n7\n00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:23.638\n>> It's a good question.\n\n8\n00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:26.575\nITIL covers a wide range of topics.\n\n9\n00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:28.110\nThis is the foundation course.\n\n10\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.220\nSo it actually can target anybody\nthat works in IT, whether you work\n\n11\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.830\nin operations in a day to day function or\nwhether you are an executive\n\n12\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.830\nthat works at the strategic functions and\nall points in between.\n\n13\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.920\nA lot of organizations adopt ITIL\n\n14\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.520\nto expand the organization\nacross various functions.\n\n15\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.140\nSo if you are an IT,\nthis is the topic for you.\n\n16\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.480\n>> All right, well if you're looking for\nthe Cisco class, this isn't then, right?\n\n17\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.570\nSo now that we know who is\nactually looking at this\n\n18\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.870\nwhy don't you give us a general idea\nof what we can expect from the series.\n\n19\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.660\n>> Sure, one way I describe this to lay\npeople that ask me, what do you do.\n\n20\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.960\nAnd I tell them I'm an ITEL instructor.\n\n21\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.580\nIt's effectively, business skills for\nIT people, right?\n\n22\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.000\nIt describes ITIL functions as\nthey relate to the business.\n\n23\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.570\nAnd I can give you a brief overview,\nhere on the slide here.\n\n24\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.550\nIn that, it starts with\nan overall description of ITIL.\n\n25\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.630\nBut then it digs in to service strategy,\nit moves to service design,\n\n26\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.150\nservice transition, service operation.\n\n27\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.630\nAnd then wraps it up with fundamentals\nof continual service improvement.\n\n28\n00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.950\nSo as you can tell it is\ncovering a wide expanse of detail\n\n29\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.420\nat a foundation level which means that\nyou're going to get a superficial\n\n30\n00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.160\nrendering of the entire ITL course books.\n\n31\n00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.150\n>> All right and anything specific that\nyou want to say about what we're going to\n\n32\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.900\nlearn in the series itself?\n\n33\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.200\n>> Yeah,\nI think the way to approach this is that,\n\n34\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.390\nunderstand you're gonna have\nsome self study, right?\n\n35\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.150\nAnd while you'll get a lot\nof good information and\n\n36\n00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.450\nconceptual hooks to hang this knowledge\non when you go through the episodes.\n\n37\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.360\nYour self study is gonna be important and\n\n38\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.350\nthe primary way to do your self study\nis to focus on some practice exams.\n\n39\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.170\nAnd there's two available,\nI'm showing you an example now,\n\n40\n00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.130\nhappens to be called sample papers,\nthey're practice exams.\n\n41\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.520\nSample Paper C and\nI'm just scrolling through here.\n\n42\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.310\nYou can see that the exam ends up being\n40 questions, this mimics the real exam.\n\n43\n00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.450\nSo obviously, they're not the exact\nsame questions, but this is very similar\n\n44\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.380\nin format, and complexity and it covers\nthe same concepts as the real exam will.\n\n45\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.620\nAnd you've got two of these.\n\n46\n00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.160\nAnd these also are accompanied\nby the answers to the exam, so\n\n47\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.270\nif you take sample paper C you also get\nanother handout that has the answers and\n\n48\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.880\nthe rationale for\nwhy that answer is correct.\n\n49\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.360\nAnd at the foundation level the rationale\nis It's because it's correct a lot,\n\n50\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.880\nit's the right answer, right.\n\n51\n00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.920\nNot necessarily a full blown explanation.\n\n52\n00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.370\nSo, I think be ready to do your\nself study these two practice\n\n53\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.460\nexams are gonna be the key methods of\nthat sell study and review, all right.\n\n54\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.970\nAnd you can use the answers and\n\n55\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.730\nthe rational to reinforce what\nyou've learned through the episodes.\n\n56\n00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.700\n>> I guess the final\nquestion I would have for\n\n57\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.820\nyou is can you tell us a little\nbit about the exam itself?\n\n58\n00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.230\nWhat can we expect as test takers,\nthe time constraints,\n\n59\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.310\nquestions, signing up,\nanything you can think of?\n\n60\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.420\n>> Sure, we'll there's 40 questions on the\nexam and you get 60 minutes to take it.\n\n61\n00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.690\nThat average about a minute and\na half, well exactly a minute and\n\n62\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.080\na half per question.\n\n63\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.050\nSo it's a pretty good clip, you just\nroll through the exam and answer them.\n\n64\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.870\nAnd it's the type of exam that it's only\ntesting at, it's testing your knowledge.\n\n65\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.550\nIt's not testing your\nability to analyze and\n\n66\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.790\nimplement ITIL,\nit really is a lot of recall.\n\n67\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.240\nSo, there's a lot of wrote\nmemorization involved and\n\n68\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.870\nconceptual awareness as opposed to\ndeep dive analysis and synthesis.\n\n69\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.490\nRight, so, it's pretty quick.\n\n70\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.300\nThere's only one right answer for\neach one.\n\n71\n00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.470\nYou gotta get 26 out of the 40,\n\n72\n00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.580\nso the bar is not super high,\n65% that turns out to be.\n\n73\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.670\n26 questions correct out of 40 and\n\n74\n00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.200\nyou are considered certified\nat the foundation level.\n\n75\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.675\nThat's how the exam looks.\n\n76\n00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:21.570\nAnd the downloads that are available\nif you look around the screen.\n\n77\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.890\nYou'll get a choice to\ndownload the episode files.\n\n78\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.530\nThose practice exams are zipped\nup in there so you can get those.\n\n79\n00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.780\nIncluding the answers and the rationale.\n\n80\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.480\nThere's the veritable goody\nbox of other things, too.\n\n81\n00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.480\nThere's instructions on how you can\njoin the ITSM community of forums.\n\n82\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.200\nSo you can come in, log in,\nget to the forum and\n\n83\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.170\nhave conversations with experts\nlike me and other instructors\n\n84\n00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.980\nas well as other candidates, the people\ntrying to get the certification.\n\n85\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.599\nSo you can post your questions and\nget good answers there.\n\n86\n00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.190\nThe course materials,\naffectedly the slide deck if you will,\n\n87\n00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.670\nit's not in powerpoint formats and\npdf format, but you get what I'm\n\n88\n00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.890\npresenting in paper form,\nthere's ways to get access to that.\n\n89\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.290\nInstructions for how to get there, and\nalso instructions for how to redeem\n\n90\n00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.890\ndiscounts for your actual exam, as well\nas to buy books, like if you want to buy\n\n91\n00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.315\nthe ITIL library books, those five core\npublications or some pocket manuals.\n\n92\n00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:25.295\nAnd things like that, so there's four\n\n93\n00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:32.505\ndeliverables that are associated with\nthe two exams and two answer sheets.\n\n94\n00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:36.465\nAnd then there is another download\nthat will give you instructions for\n\n95\n00:05:36.465 --> 00:05:40.495\nhow you can redeem those discounts for all\nthose resources including the
