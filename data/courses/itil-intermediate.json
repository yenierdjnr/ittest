and\n\n3\n00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:08.830\nValidation.\n\n4\n00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.020\nWe wanna make sure that you have\nan understanding of what's going on,\n\n5\n00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.990\nand here to help us understand\nnot only some exam details but\n\n6\n00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.550\nalso what we'll be covering in this\nnew show is gonna be Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n7\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.617\nSo, Terry, tell us what we're\nactually gonna be taking a look at.\n\n8\n00:00:21.617 --> 00:00:25.874\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is an intermediate level\ncourse, release, control, and validation.\n\n9\n00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:30.172\nAnd if you've had foundation,\nthat's actually a prerequisite for\n\n10\n00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:34.393\nthis course, you will have taken\na survey of all the topics in ITIL at\n\n11\n00:00:34.393 --> 00:00:36.450\na very superficial level.\n\n12\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.960\nAnd you need it to know some things and\nmemorize some things.\n\n13\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.930\nThis one's gonna dive deeper and actually\nmake you apply knowledge to pass the exam.\n\n14\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.010\nSo just take a look here at some of\nthe graphical treatments of this.\n\n15\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.520\nFirst of all, the expectation of this is\nthat certainly you're gonna learn from\n\n16\n00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.700\nthe episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.450\nI'm going to be giving lots of real world\nexamples in these upcoming episodes and\n\n18\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.850\nmake sure you understand conceptually how\nthese things apply in the real world and\n\n19\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.890\nhow this knowledge can be\napplied in an exam setting.\n\n20\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.100\nBut there's going to be some self-study.\n\n21\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.580\nThere's also a lot of value\nengaging in discussion forums.\n\n22\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.783\nThere you can ask questions of\nother experts, other students.\n\n23\n00:01:12.783 --> 00:01:16.430\nAnd there's also some practice exams\navailable as downloads as well.\n\n24\n00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.202\nThat is probably the most valuable single\ndownload in this suite of downloads.\n\n25\n00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:24.600\nAll right.\n\n26\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.030\nThe analysis that you need to provide\nis not just providing knowledge.\n\n27\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.120\nYou're going to have to\napply this knowledge.\n\n28\n00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.453\nIt falls on this continuum of\nlearning called Bloom's taxonomy.\n\n29\n00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:36.750\nAnd you'll see it's not\njust remembering things.\n\n30\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.030\nThat's what foundation was.\n\n31\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.550\nIt was remembering and understanding.\n\n32\n00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.210\nWe've moved up the Bloom's taxonomy scale\na little bit to Level 3 and Level 4,\n\n33\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.920\nwhere you analyze and\nthen apply this information.\n\n34\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.900\nSo it's gonna be a deeper dive and\nactually going to be applying this\n\n35\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.890\nknowledge, not just regurgitating it,\nright.\n\n36\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.360\nSo to do that, you're gonna be listening\nto me, take part in the discussions, and\n\n37\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.830\nabsolutely critical that you\nlook at the exercises and\n\n38\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.070\nfollow through with the practice exams.\n\n39\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.600\nAll of these are available for\ndownloads, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.845\nSo how does this fit into\nthe qualification scheme of ITIL?\n\n41\n00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:13.160\nWell, first of all,\nI'm an accredited trainer.\n\n42\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.911\nI had to go through and\npass muster as an ITL Expert.\n\n43\n00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:17.610\nThat's an official title.\n\n44\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.750\nAnd that was given to my by following\nthrough with appropriate training and\n\n45\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.830\nexams through an accredited\ntraining organization.\n\n46\n00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.570\nI'm representing PassionIT Group as an\nATO, an authorized training organization.\n\n47\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.715\nAnd here working with the affiliate\nITProTV to deliver this training in\n\n48\n00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:35.660\nan accredited fashion, right?\n\n49\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.277\nThe exam institutes, PeopleCert, EXIN,\n\n50\n00:02:38.277 --> 00:02:43.600\nthey are actually the organizations that\naccredit these training schemes, right?\n\n51\n00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.190\nSo the course materials I'm presenting\nto you in lecture have been\n\n52\n00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.070\nreviewed by the accrediting agency,\nthey've been blessed by the accrediting\n\n53\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.630\nagency as being valid, and map to\nthe official syllabus as owned by AXELOS,\n\n54\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.350\nyou'll see there at\nthe bottom of the pyramid.\n\n55\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.237\nSo AXELOS is the parent and AXELOS is\nthe one that enable these other parts\n\n56\n00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:05.290\nof the accreditation scheme to work, okay.\n\n57\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.380\nThis is the exam scheme, these\nare the various exams you could be taking.\n\n58\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.490\nIf you look in the green area there,\nyou'll see lifecycle stages.\n\n59\n00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.040\nThey're abbreviated, service strategy,\n\n60\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.830\nservice design, transition, operations,\nand continual service improvement.\n\n61\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.170\nOver here on the right, you'll see OSA,\n\n62\n00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.270\nPPO, RCV, that's this course,\nRelease Control and Validation.\n\n63\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.770\nThey give you a few more credits.\n\n64\n00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.251\nWhat RCV does is it takes from\nmultiple books on the left and\n\n65\n00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:38.929\ncreates a course that's\noperationally relevant, right.\n\n66\n00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:43.130\nSo Release, Control, and Validation is\nthis collection of topics that point to\n\n67\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.211\nthe value of delivering high quality\nservices through appropriate Release,\n\n68\n00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:49.470\nControl, and Validation processes.\n\n69\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.310\nWe're gonna be looking at those seven\nprocesses in the upcoming episodes, right.\n\n70\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.570\nAnother certification\npath you could be on,\n\n71\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.180\nis toward expert,\nwhere you collect these credits, right?\n\n72\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.150\nSo if you get two credits for foundation,\nyou can get three credits for\n\n73\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.210\npractitioner.\n\n74\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.760\nThree credits for\nthe ones there in the green,\n\n75\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.440\nwhich are called the lifecycle modules.\n\n76\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.560\nThe capability modules\ngives you four credits.\n\n77\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.230\nSo passing this exam is going to give you\nfour credits toward the accreditation\n\n78\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.780\nas an ITIL expert.\n\n79\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.325\nOnce you have 17 credits in your pocket,\n\n80\n00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:24.160\nyou're eligible to take the course\ncalled Managing Across the Lifecycle.\n\n81\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.255\nYou see it there in green,\nnear the top of this house.\n\n82\n00:04:28.255 --> 00:04:29.701\nThat gives you five credits.\n\n83\n00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:35.575\n17 plus the 5 give you the 22 credits\nyou need to be deemed an ITIL expert.\n\n84\n00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:40.045\nIf you're so inclined, you could also\nconsider an ITIL Master certification.\n\n85\n00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:45.615\nThis one is very hard to get\nin that you have to write and\n\n86\n00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:50.875\nhave basically a thesis, have a good\ncommand of all the principles of ITIL and\n\n87\n00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:54.550\nshow that you have that\ncommand in your paper, right?\n\n88\n00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.110\nA lot of pretty pictures,\nlot of pretty graphs.\n\n89\n00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.370\nYou send that good 20 page paper or\n\n90\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.420\nso off to the accrediting agencies\nalong with a check for $5,000.\n\n91\n00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.780\nAnd then you can have people snatch\nthe pebble from your hand and\n\n92\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.687\nbe called an ITIL master, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:13.180\nSo that's the exam scheme of things.\n\n94\n00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.887\nAgain, you're just one going into\nthe intermediates here with RVC.\n\n95\n00:05:16.887 --> 00:05:18.720\nYou'll see the other ones.\n\n96\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.069\nIn upcoming episodes here at ITProTV,\n\n97\n00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.779\nwe'll be tackling some of these\nother topics as well, okay.\n\n98\n00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.595\nSo moving forward then is again this\nrecognition that you need to be\n\n99\n00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.868\nproviding some solid information, right.\n\n100\n00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:35.860\nWe're looking here at\nthe lifecycle modules.\n\n101\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.653\nWe're in capabilities in RCV.\n\n102\n00:05:38.653 --> 00:05:43.855\nThe exam itself is only eight questions,\nso the margin of error is kind of small.\n\n103\n00:05:43.855 --> 00:05:46.215\nAnd you'll see that there's\nalso gradient scoring.\n\n104\n00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:50.395\nWhat that means is that for these eight\nquestions on the exam, you're going to be\n\n105\n00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:55.983\nanalyzing a scenario and then answering a\nquestion based on that specific scenario.\n\n106\n00:05:55.983 --> 00:06:00.031\nIf you pick the best answer out of\nthe four choices, you'll get a 5.\n\n107\n00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:04.563\nIf you pick the next best answer,\nyou'll get 3, a 1, and a 0, etc.\n\n108\n00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:09.243\nSo if you do the math here, you gotta do\neight questions, the max you can get on\n\n109\n00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:14.511\neach question is 5, so the total you\ncould score of 100% is getting 40, right?\n\n110\n00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:16.330\nYour score would be 40.\n\n111\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.330\nPassing is 28,\n70% of all available marks, right?\n\n112\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.092\nIf you do the math on that,\nacross eight questions, that means if\n\n113\n00:06:26.092 --> 00:06:31.030\nyou got six three point answers for\n18 plus two 5 point answers for\n\n114\n00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.034\n10, that would be the sweet\nspot of 28 out of 40.\n\n115\n00:06:35.034 --> 00:06:38.925\nOf course, as you do the math on that,\npicking a zero answer, of course is going\n\n116\n00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:43.180\nto mean you're going to have to find some\nmore five answers later on, on the exam.\n\n117\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.370\nSo they are challenging.\n\n118\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.570\nThey are fair.\n\n119\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.040\nBut they certainly are challenging\nas they try to test your ability\n\n120\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.970\nnot just to regurgitate knowledge, but\n\n121\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.910\nto apply knowledge,\nwhich is an interesting trick on an exam.\n\n122\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.122\nAgain, very challenging, also very fair.\n\n123\n00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:03.990\nAnd the good news is, you have some\nresources at your fingertips, right?\n\n124\n00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.720\nThese resources include practice exams\nthemselves, and you can download these.\n\n125\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.890\nThere's a case study, there are exercises\nassociated with that case study.\n\n126\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.910\nAnd there's also a glossary available for\ndownload.\n\n127\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.050\nThis download is available to you within\nthe episodes themselves to subscribers.\n\n128\n00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.150\nAnd you can download those that\nare available throughout the entire\n\n129\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.320\nshow, right?\n\n130\n00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.790\nI highly encourage you to\nrely on those resources and\n\n131\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.910\nuse them as self study tools\nas you're taking the episodes.\n\n132\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.380\nA great approach would be, watch an\nepisode, do some review, watch an episode,\n\n133\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.590\ndo some review.\n\n134\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.840\nThe discussion forums are also\na valuable place to turn to.\n\n135\n00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.830\nITProTV provides a discussion forum,\nyou can engage with other students,\n\n136\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.360\nyou can also engage with experts.\n\n137\n00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.750\nI'll be there to answer some questions,\n\n138\n00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.480\nother experts in the field will be\nthere to answer your questions.\n\n139\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.480\nA very great way to learn and\n\n140\n00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.610\nget over on this challenge of\nmastering the topics of RCV.\n\n141\n00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.670\nThe exam itself is available\nthrough an online format.\n\n142\n00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.189\nYou can take it

They emphasize the goal request fulfillment is not so much about incident management as it is about fulfilling planned expectations.  They also discuss request fulfillment in terms of using a self-fulfillment portal or a service desk.

With the nature of the “ocean” of information there of course needs one some type of system (SKMS) to help with the management, distribution and use of the data available, according to the guys.  They also emphasize there is no one system to do it all but it will require integration of multiple systems that may have data; it may require a custom system; it may require just record keeping that is indexed to allow for the discovery of that information.
